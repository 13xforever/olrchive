487	19088	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19941	24423	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 215 for this January 7th, 2007.
24923	34807	And what's going on actually right now while we're doing tonight's program and taping here live on this Sunday night is that actually Microsoft is giving their keynote speech right now, right?
34907	37188	Over for CES because Consumer Electronics Show is going on?
37469	38249	Yes.
38309	42911	Loki, you've got to start us off with Part B, talking about what's going on at CES right now.
42991	45012	Yeah, there's a couple of big announcements.
46024	49968	made about, you know, during CES and the keynote speech here.
50008	59797	Of course, as we mentioned earlier, their big announcement, of course, was partnership, I guess, with Microsoft TV, which is an IPTV service.
60378	70187	And you're going to be able to watch TV, I guess, streamed over the Internet, as well as record TV while playing games, which is pretty cool.
71065	77367	and no clue yet when exactly that's going to go into effect, but it's something that they're going to launch this year.
78127	85270	It's going to have digital video recording capabilities for gaming movie viewing and even voice and video chat.
86290	91652	It says we're really going to need a big hard drive for that.
92432	95053	It says live chat while watching television.
96381	98683	So people can watch Lost or something.
98903	100965	Oh my god, that's a bad idea.
102366	108690	Playing over Xbox Live while recording TV live in the background.
109611	114334	And this isn't a huge surprise, because I remember they were talking about something with DirecTV before.
114354	117357	So, I don't know.
117697	118237	That's kind of cool.
118998	123761	The other thing which is going on right now that they were talking about was...
125680	128060	I believe Halo 2 for Vista
155253	158635	But that is not the only game that you can play anywhere.
160056	163017	Which just was announced a few seconds ago here.
163718	170462	The one live anywhere game that's going to be able to be played on Vista, on 360, and everything else.
171482	173483	But not only than Uno.
174324	175344	Uno Anywhere.
176005	177646	Oh my gosh, wow, interesting.
178426	181948	Really, you know, I always thought you could play Uno Anywhere anyways because it's cards, but...
182914	183317	That's just me.
183397	185512	You can play the electronic version anywhere you want.
185959	188660	Draw4Bitch everywhere across multiple platforms.
188940	191381	You know, I think it's interesting because it's not a big surprise.
191501	193442	It doesn't seem like anything that would be too difficult to do.
193822	197384	I mean, cross-platform gaming is not unheard of.
197404	203707	And even with 360, I mean, Final Fantasy XI, you play against PlayStation 2 and PC users on Final Fantasy XI, right?
203727	204087	Which is on the 360.
204127	206188	So it's not like this is unheard of.
206248	209249	It's just kind of, I don't think anybody thought that they would do this.
209309	212051	I mean, it's not really anything anyone was expecting.
212091	215332	It's really, truly a kind of pleasant surprise, if you will.
215618	215778	Yeah.
215938	216578	Kind of interesting.
217738	220579	For once and for all, they will be able to settle the debate.
220939	225140	Is it easier to play with the keyboard and mouse or with the 360 controller?
225160	226680	They'll be able to finally settle that debate.
227200	227520	Great.
229461	229961	Very cool.
232301	236542	Yeah, the chat room seems to be agreeing over at chat.orangelonestradio.com.
236582	238682	You can play Uno with anyone anytime you want.
238722	240163	Just buy a deck of cards.
240883	241543	It's very easy.
242142	243602	I have an Uno deck.
243643	247664	But you can't get the Cameo cards and the Project Gotham Racing cards.
247704	247964	So?
249864	258207	But I believe you can get, in regular traditional card form, you can get Pokemon cards and the clear cards so you can play Uno in the pool.
259207	262608	And you know, you can play World of Warcraft cards, too, once those come out.
262729	263609	Hooray, hooray.
266690	266950	All right.
267270	270531	Well, I guess that's all we have coming out of CES right now.
271578	272539	There is one other thing.
272619	279545	Sony's saying that they've hit their target amount of units shipped for the PlayStation 3, which was 1 million by the end of the year.
280205	286670	Although, if memory serves me correctly, I believe that target was a lot higher, and then they lowered it down.
287030	290893	And the other thing, too, is they've shipped 1 million units worldwide.
291354	292915	Not sold, shipped.
292935	293596	They'll sell it.
294076	294616	They'll sell it.
295637	299300	I know we're all seeing the big pictures of stacks and stacks of PS3s on block.
299799	300340	They'll sell them.
300420	304022	Their next target is 6 million by March this year, so.
304582	305303	Now that's ambitious.
306083	306404	We'll see.
307705	312007	One thing I wanted to ask about, too, and you showed me this during the break while we were alive.
312388	318852	You have this Impossible Mission ad, and I want, it's Impossible Mission on the Wii, like the old school Commodore 64 game.
318872	319813	Yeah, it's one of the games.
320193	322675	I remember hearing Epyx was coming back and was going to redo games.
323375	323956	What the hell is this?
323976	324316	I want it.
324356	325937	Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, Loki.
326197	328819	It's being released in the UK right now.
330878	333299	System 3 is putting it out.
333719	337702	Basically, this is an ad sheet that they had on GoNintendo.com.
338763	341104	It's just an impossible mission.
341204	344026	It's 2D.
345027	348989	It just looks like a visually updated version of a possible mission.
349349	351011	So they're only getting it in Britain and not here?
352011	352391	So far.
353072	354233	It might end up coming over here.
354533	355613	The one game I want.
356934	357835	They do this to us.
360387	362788	Don't say you folks over there don't get some love.
362808	364689	Maybe you should import a Wii.
365749	366990	I'm not going to import... Well, I can.
367170	368851	They're on the different TV standards over there.
369351	369951	Component.
370611	371172	I guess that's true.
371772	374393	I'm not going to import a Wii just to play Impossible Mission.
374433	374913	I'm sorry.
375413	379015	I'll just... I'll write nasty grams to whatever company... System 3.
379215	381616	I'll write nasty grams to them until they put this out in the U.S.
381876	383617	I'm sure it'll come out over here at some point.
383697	384077	It better.
384497	386038	At least it's a budget title if nothing else.
387318	388919	So... Well...
390060	390620	E for everyone!
420664	422085	I love games!
422145	424007	They're so pretty!
424507	426108	Can I have a hug?
426769	428990	The Entertainment for All Expo... Jamie!
429111	429911	Cuddle!
432333	433514	What?
433974	434154	No.
435075	443001	The Entertainment for All Expo, as it suggests, is open to the public if you have $100, because it's going to cost you $100 to get into it.
443942	445443	So... Well, what?
445643	446604	It's going to cost what?
446984	448585	$100 to get into the Expo.
449566	449666	Ugh.
450994	452015	I guess that's not too bad.
452055	461283	I mean, if E3 wanted to charge you $100 to get in... Actually, from what I remember, any schmo could really get into E3 for, what, that $400 fee or whatever it is.
461864	464386	You really didn't even have to have ties to the industry to get in that way.
464886	467829	So, you know, this is, I guess, cheaper than that.
468289	474214	Because I imagine this expo will still be letting in, you know, media and all that type of stuff for a different rate.
474575	475315	Probably not the same $100.
476116	476356	Maybe.
476396	476776	Interesting.
477017	477317	Interesting.
478038	478438	We'll see.
479534	483781	But yeah, it'll be interesting to see how it ends up going down.
484442	488588	But it's going to be this year, 18th through the 20th of October.
488949	493035	And good point, we got several people starting with Blackboy saying, except it isn't E3.
493135	494778	And you know, I understand, but...
495867	498628	It's kind of, for all we know, all we got otherwise.
499168	508450	And they say they're trying to fill the void, so I realize it's going to be a little different because it's going to be targeted at the gamer as opposed to the industry, but it should be interesting nonetheless.
508490	512251	Well, I should be able to still go to the E3, the actual E3.
512431	515231	Yeah, that's true, because it's not going away.
515511	517752	It would be interesting to see what happens.
517772	519972	Don't fucking take me to E3, bitches.
521352	521993	I need this.
523093	523773	It's my high.
525584	527065	I need that E, man.
528227	528887	I need to cuddle.
546907	547608	and DarkSakura.com.
573427	574128	Very interesting.
574168	576309	I mean, just a few months ago, we were talking about all that fear.
576329	582774	But, you know, I know it's easy to want to, like, jump on Sony and be all like, ha-ha, Sony's not selling systems, blah, blah, blah.
583074	584916	But you kind of have to think about, too, Christmas is over.
585945	588967	So I think more people are willing to wait, but I don't know.
589007	594150	I guess then again, the Wii is still seemingly selling out, and the 360 at this time last year was still selling out too.
594710	595731	I don't know.
596131	603776	I'd be very interested to see it on a graph, like how many systems Microsoft had out there at this time last year, and how many Sony has out there now.
604372	604852	You know what I mean?
605152	607394	I mean, it's just because I'm a visual person, I want to see everything on a graph.
607414	609795	But I'd be very interested to see how it really compares.
609835	614237	Because you could say that the 360 was still sold out, but from what I remember, they weren't coming out very often.
614518	617059	Whereas Sony seems to be doing a pretty consistent weekly shipment.
617079	624943	Well, according to this was the big thing that they were pushing, they were saying that we outsold the 360 because we put out a million units before the end of the year and they only had 600,000.
624983	629626	So... Yeah, but... Interesting.
629846	633588	But here's the thing, Microsoft was like, yeah, but bitches, we were out the year before you, so...
634389	635850	We're ahead of you by a couple million.
638192	642935	Okay, so Sony's saying they're on the track to outsell the 360 is what they're saying.
642955	646778	They're still convinced that they're... Microsoft's saying, we lapped you, bitch.
647278	649920	They're just like saying, oh, we're meeting our numbers.
649960	657946	Yeah, well, when you drop your numbers like six times and then you're like, oh yeah, we met our numbers fucking six months late.
659282	660603	and we lowered them a bit.
661163	661783	But we met them.
662184	663204	God damn it, we met them.
663404	671028	I mean, no, you didn't technically meet them because, well, you only ship less than 400,000 units at launch in the U.S., so, whatever.
671808	673969	DDR Dollar Bill says, this is Sony math.
674870	675410	Exactly.
676270	679912	Remember, it's the math of those who eat crayons every day.
680933	686675	Well, we have a little bit of something flying around on the rumor mill.
687516	687616	Um,
688243	689984	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
709235	712878	To where we were at that last Konami event that they had in, what, August?
713238	715499	And I remember they were showing Coded Arms on the PSP, right, Loki?
715760	715880	Yeah.
715900	719642	But they never showed us Coded Arms on PS3, but I remember some of the other journalists were asking about it.
720143	722004	They were really dodgy at the questions at the time, huh?
722204	722924	If I remember right.
723545	725346	It's like they didn't want to say much about it.
725626	727868	Well, at E3, I think it was only a video.
728268	728508	Yeah.
729189	732291	Well, this other press event we went to was after that, so... Yeah.
732431	734692	But they still were not really saying much about it, huh?
734752	736053	I guess we'll find out in a few weeks.
736093	736894	Yeah, I guess it's interesting.
737446	741309	I want to say I heard that the game was really buggy and crappy from the beta or whatever state it's in right now, alpha or whatever
767608	768289	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
778527	780668	I don't know, it's not coming out anytime soon either way.
781209	784691	Mystic Gohan says, well, Coded Arms sucked, so I'm not getting my hopes up yet.
785131	788293	Legend of Zaku says, only thing that can save PlayStation 3 is Metal Gear Solid 4.
789173	791695	Mike W. also agrees, Coded Arms sucked ass.
791835	793616	I don't really think you need to save the PlayStation 3.
793656	796878	The only thing you need to save the PlayStation 3 is put more games out, that's about it.
797278	799399	And put more games out that haven't been out for six months on the 360.
799739	801920	I mean, that's what they need to do.
801940	806263	I mean, why the fuck, seriously, like, games that are supposed to be launch titles, like
806809	809870	Rainbow Six Vegas or something like that and they haven't even put it out yet.
809890	810550	I mean, come on.
811670	812350	That's the problem.
813191	826294	Anyways, so as we were probably talking about here, Metal Gear Solid and how Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3.
826574	829635	Well, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops just came out on the PSP.
830615	833595	Not a huge surprise that they're talking about getting a sequel done already.
834196	835616	And, you know, since the game
836064	837085	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
865746	866346	Oh, I hope not.
866986	868927	But maybe it'll come with cool 3D glasses.
869087	873949	That was actually... I don't think your acid is like what happens when you program a game on acid.
874029	875269	You know what, though?
875289	876950	The 3D thing I actually thought was kind of cute.
877070	882091	I have to admit, that little, you know, the little paper glasses or whatever they're playing acid 2 on, it's actually kind of cute.
882111	883472	Well, it was cute watching Dan play it.
883492	885833	You know what the best part about the 3D glasses?
885973	886153	Huh?
886173	891475	Were the videos of the hot Asian chicks wearing the camo bikinis that you would unlock from playing the game.
892295	892375	In 3D.
896698	899519	Anyway, I thought you got laid on a regular basis.
899559	905440	Do not even talk about Asian girls in bikinis and things because... Yeah, how's Dead or Alive Extreme going?
907060	915542	I'm actually referring to a video that one of our listeners, I don't know if he wants to tell me about it, he just laughed at it.
916762	924644	I got sent Aparapara videos with really ugly, way too skinny Japanese girls in bikinis.
925545	926425	Ganguro Makeup.
928426	934787	So, you can't say those words together in a sentence without me freaking out a little bit.
934967	938407	We had some weirder stuff with the Asian girls on the Wednesday show.
940348	941308	I'm not even going there.
941328	948029	Let's move on to one other way that listeners can interact with us and give their feedback is our voicemail.
948049	948929	Our 800 number, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
948969	949369	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
955194	981874	and we got some voicemails this week thanks to those of you guys that left the voicemails that number is toll free in the US and Canada but I want to point out it's not toll free outside of that which makes this first voicemail all the more special this actually came in on the Skype part of that because if you are in the UK or Australia, New Zealand wherever the heck you are in the world you can use the Skype to leave us a message for free you can just call Orange Lounge Radio when we're not live and leave us a voicemail that's what this first voicemail is from let's take a listen
983186	985367	Hey guys, this is Sosha from the UK.
985707	1005253	I was just wondering, you mentioned every Xtend Extra on the show a couple of times, so I looked it up, and it's not coming out in the UK until like the middle of February, and I was wondering if you were importing it off eBay, and also is DDR Supernova worth the wait, because it's coming out in like February as well, I think.
1006351	1008353	Anyway, guys, keep up the good work.
1008493	1012536	I love listening to the show, especially when I'm on the bus because bus rides are so boring.
1012956	1017839	And I do get funny looks when I start laughing at all the weird stuff you come out with.
1019140	1019941	Anyway, guys, see ya.
1020862	1021702	Thank you for the voicemail.
1021722	1022503	That was pretty awesome.
1023243	1023684	Let's see.
1024404	1031829	As far as Every Extend Extra goes, check out... You can actually play for free on the internet.
1031869	1033691	You can download Every Extend...
1034361	1035483	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1041883	1042624	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1071983	1073864	And the game's pretty fun.
1073924	1074784	It's no Luminous.
1074985	1077446	I don't hold it up to that same high caliber.
1077726	1079967	And it's a little more action than it is puzzle.
1080027	1082528	I mean, it's more of like a fast-paced puzzle game.
1082548	1084189	There's definitely a lot of action element involved.
1084589	1085190	But it's pretty cool.
1085750	1090792	As far as DDR Supernova, it's kind of hard to tell because the game varies from region to region because of licenses.
1091132	1094154	But here in America, I did think Supernova was probably...
1094634	1098416	about on the same level with DDR Extreme 2, if not a little bit better.
1098516	1104138	So I'd say it's worth your time if you're a DDR fan, or if you've never played the series before, it certainly is a good enabler.
1104478	1112342	And from what I remember, the UK, in my opinion anyway, typically gets better licenses anyway than we do, so I'm sure it's going to be even more worth your while.
1112482	1118264	I'd have to say the last Stepping Stage had a... Not Stepping... Yeah, is it... What is it?
1118404	1119445	Not Stepping Stage, it's a...
1121243	1125865	Dancing Stage, that's what I'm trying to think of, had actually a really, really good track list.
1125965	1130408	I'd hope that some of those would be incorporated into some of our releases, but unfortunately, no.
1131988	1137671	Well, yeah, it's always like a licensing issue, and you know, the music that sells over there isn't the same that sells over here all the time.
1137691	1140573	I mean, some of the hits are the same, but for instance, you know, take an artist like...
1141184	1141865	Robby Williams
1156956	1157576	Hi, this is Razorburn2021.
1157596	1158516	You'll never see me in the chat room.
1158536	1159397	You'll probably never see me around.
1159417	1159897	I happen to be in
1186141	1187121	Offline Listener.
1187221	1191183	I listen via my PSP and Bleaching Connections.
1191223	1195264	I just wanted to thank you for a very nice year of episodes.
1195664	1206387	I listen to them at work and they really provide me with the news, albeit it's generally kind of a week late of stuff, but it's a way I'm able to keep up on what's going in the gaming world.
1207908	1210509	I've kind of jumped back and forth between a lot of podcasts.
1210529	1214370	You're one of the first ones I've picked up and I've stuck with you.
1214430	1214530	I'm
1215103	1222028	Just really happy with your show and I want to wish you a happy new year and say thank you and please provide me more in the future.
1223869	1225050	Aw, thanks for the warm fuzzies.
1225090	1225871	We appreciate that.
1225931	1227792	We like the little compliments to keep us going.
1227812	1228412	That's very nice.
1228813	1235897	And you know, all things considered, there's a purposeful reason why I played this one because he said that he listened to the show on the PSP.
1236398	1240781	And I think last week on the New Year's Eve special, I was a little bit harsh on the PSP.
1242095	1249722	I do really like the PSP as a multimedia device.
1249962	1251984	It is an incredible multimedia device.
1252244	1257089	It plays videos, MP3s, and games and all the movie stuff on top of that.
1257629	1261710	The problem is, as a gaming device solely, I don't think it's up to par with the DS.
1261730	1263030	And that's my own personal opinion.
1263050	1266851	I don't think the library of games that the PSP is offering is quite up to par with the DS.
1267111	1274273	But I think the fact that people do listen to the show on the PSP kind of speaks to why the PSP is a pretty good system.
1274293	1279834	Because of the fact, hey, not only can you listen to these RSS feeds on the go over the internet, but you can play Luminous too.
1280234	1282635	I mean, that's what's great about the PSP.
1283315	1312801	and why if you don't own one you should think about it I mean they are they really are pretty decent systems they're just not if you're only looking for gaming and maybe you already have an iPod you already have a laptop to get your podcast on the go or whatever maybe you don't need it you know but if you don't have any of that stuff I think the PSP is a pretty good buy to get a lot of that crap on the go if you haven't bought one yet you might want to hold off anyways because you know what the rumor mills been saying is that they're going to redesign it anyway so
1313627	1314529	and DarkSakura.com.
1324312	1326954	Silly, I'm talking about portable devices, obviously.
1327274	1328275	Laptop.
1328355	1331438	Well, but laptops are thousands of dollars for a good one.
1331578	1334480	And they're not that, I mean, they're portable, but you've got to whip this thing out.
1334500	1335681	It's not that portable.
1335761	1336682	PSP.
1337062	1338844	Okay, but PSP goes in your, but sidekick.
1340245	1344168	A PSP is better than a sidekick, I think, except for the fact you can't make calls with a PSP.
1344228	1345829	I already have a phone.
1346189	1348832	I think the PSP is a pretty cool little pocket system.
1350273	1351233	How big are your pockets?
1351694	1351874	Big.
1353191	1354452	I can fit PSP in my pocket, no problem.
1354472	1355213	I can fit PSP in my pocket.
1355593	1356594	My DS fits in my purse.
1357435	1358296	That little micro thing.
1358336	1360118	Your PSP could probably fit in your purse, too.
1360658	1361119	No, it wouldn't.
1361599	1361839	Really?
1362180	1366544	No, I can barely get... I have no idea what happened to my Sonic screwdriver.
1366724	1367585	It fell out of my purse.
1368205	1368405	That sucks.
1368425	1369386	It doesn't even that fit.
1370628	1370848	All right.
1371328	1373951	And there was another comment in here somewhere I wanted to read.
1375852	1376473	Well, I guess that was it.
1376493	1378555	I can't find the other one, so there you have it.
1379995	1384740	Chat.OrangeHouseRadio.com if you're listening live on this Sunday night and you want to join or entertain your thoughts.
1385101	1388545	And of course the chat room is open all week long and it gets kind of dead when there's no live programming.
1388685	1389846	I have to agree with Ranma on this.
1389946	1390447	What did Ranma say?
1390607	1393991	A laptop may be thousands of dollars but it is more useful than a damn PSP.
1394331	1394472	But...
1395112	1400476	If you're a 14-year-old kid, you may not have a need for a laptop.
1400496	1401957	They make very small laptops, too.
1402217	1402977	Those new Vios.
1403257	1408701	I just think, yes, a laptop you get a lot of value of, but you have to ask yourself, do you really need all that stuff?
1408801	1418007	I mean, how easy is it to turn on your PSP, click, have the headphones in, and listen to the show, as opposed to, I better whip out the laptop, fire up iTunes, da-da-da.
1418067	1419148	I mean, don't get me wrong.
1419188	1420889	A laptop serves a very useful purpose.
1421369	1426291	I heart my little Mac laptop, and it's one of the best purchases I made last year.
1426691	1430852	But, you know, I still also like my PSP for those types of things.
1430912	1432012	I need a bigger memory card, though.
1433053	1433313	All right.
1435033	1441635	You can also interact with us by sending us emails to mailbag at orangelauncher.com, and we will get to the mailbag a little bit later in the show.
1441675	1443076	But first, more news.
1443936	1446297	I want to start off with this story coming from Korea.
1446317	1446577	Korea.
1447919	1451544	Game censorship, a hot topic worldwide, not just Korea, but worldwide.
1451564	1461115	Of course, you know, in 2006, we had Rule of Rose causing the problems in Europe and Tack Johnson getting his head into everything over here, which we just go away.
1462337	1465901	In South Korea, things are actually going kind of,
1466420	1467421	and DarkSakura.com
1486897	1494639	But what just recently happened, the Game Reading Board of Korea actually said that they are going to lift the ban, and in 2007 these games will become available.
1495099	1504602	And the head of the rating board, Kim Ki-man, said in the Korea Times, quote, the reasoning behind the decision was said to be to allow freedom of expression.
1505602	1506322	So, there you go.
1508202	1510343	So that's pretty cool, I think, that, you know, I...
1511058	1512239	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1534045	1534425	I would hope.
1534585	1535406	I would really, really hope.
1535946	1541008	Well, I'm all for expression and it looks like there's another way to express yourself.
1542229	1545850	And that's by turning your Wii into a vibrator.
1546230	1547491	Your Wiimote into a vibrator.
1549352	1552853	Hey, it can be done with the Res Trans Vibrator.
1553494	1558556	We can have the Hello Kitty and I found a Doraemon vibrator on eBay.
1558616	1558816	Okay.
1560169	1561449	It's a program that's put out by KAKO.
1561489	1561649	Shut up.
1561669	1561810	K-A-K-O.
1586932	1593777	You download it to your PC, hook it up to your Bluetooth, and it vibrates on command, I guess.
1594097	1596239	You know, I want to say, though, there was an easier way to do this.
1596639	1601142	Someone was posting before there was some sort of flaw in the Opera browser.
1602023	1605865	I guess it was a URL that's too long or something.
1605885	1611229	The tag will cause your browser to crash, and I think it causes the remote to vibrate as well.
1611629	1613071	I think that might be an easier way to do that.
1613731	1615472	So something easier than using your Kako?
1616133	1616353	Yes.
1616373	1616533	Okay.
1616994	1618355	I'm looking at the guy's site, actually.
1618435	1646094	There's a Wii Remote Test, Wii Saber, there's, um, okay, I can't read this, a Wii Braider Test, Wii Mice Test, um, Wii Fall Detect Test, a Wii Remote IR Sensor Test, um, Wii Pointer Test, uh, Wii Nunchaku, I guess Nunchaku Test, um, a bunch of stuff.
1646718	1647438	This is crazy.
1647558	1650500	SithSpawn in our chatroom says, set Wiimotes to orgasm.
1653001	1657683	I'm linking this though in the chatroom so that they too can enjoy the Wii Braider.
1657743	1659044	The joys of the Wii.
1659864	1666667	Well, a couple websites out there want you to enjoy the Wii as well.
1667327	1668608	Especially when it comes to porn.
1668948	1674611	Yes, a few websites out there are making their porno...
1675430	1676130	WeFriendly.
1676210	1677091	Wait, this reminds me.
1677191	1679031	Jamie, did I tell you about what we did on New Year's Eve?
1680092	1680332	Orgy?
1680792	1680932	No.
1681112	1682272	We had about 12 people over here.
1682292	1683293	You called me drunk.
1683673	1685534	No, we had about 12 people over here.
1686054	1691336	And we had this, you know, somebody that we know had said they'd never seen a porno before.
1691896	1698518	So we decided to use the internet browsing capabilities of the Wii to surf to Pornotube.com and bring it up on the Wii.
1698678	1699819	And by the way, if you're under 18, don't do this.
1704650	1712595	But yeah, we looked up, let me just say the first thing we clicked on, because we couldn't resist, said pterodactyl porn.
1716137	1718078	Yeah, it really is what it sounds like.
1719099	1720760	It's something to behold, I'll give it that.
1722881	1724702	Again, don't go to that website if you're under 18, kids.
1725142	1726683	Sorry, Loki, I had to share that.
1727624	1729785	You did use the Wii for pornographic purposes already.
1730125	1731586	Oh yeah, we've done that a few times.
1732891	1761885	um anyways um so yeah it was a apparently a free one of the free adult sites out there and if you're curious on um wondering what site I'm not really gonna go give them free advertising but it's uh listed on arstechnica.com uh if you go to the free site apparently so you're giving free advertising by proxy yes you make no sense it's a free porn site out there one I have never heard of by the way um
1763496	1764577	and doesn't look that good, by the way.
1765657	1769679	Anyway, so it's free and apparently it's Wii friendly.
1770019	1778724	So, it's kind of neat that they're, you know, and usually, you know, it's kind of funny, porn studios are usually ahead of the game for the most part with technology.
1778784	1786968	I know porn studios were the first ones to actually have, I think, DVDs and recordable VHS stuff as well.
1787368	1791410	And now that they're, you know, kind of making content for the PSP and the Wii and
1792588	1793969	God knows what other browsers out there.
1794049	1796171	So, not a huge surprise.
1796612	1797352	That's kind of cool, though.
1798493	1801956	Just think of all the porn sites that are going to use that play on the Wii name.
1802497	1809923	Just think of all the Fox News stories we're going to see about how the Wii is a gateway to porno for your children.
1809943	1811685	Wah, evil.
1814607	1817350	Sometimes I wish this next guy would just go away.
1817430	1818831	It's a story about Uwe Boll.
1819563	1820584	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1849531	1850492	Sorry, couldn't help myself.
1850993	1854057	Because this is already a big franchise for them and they want to keep it going.
1854557	1857921	I think they will be more involved in the whole process than the other companies before.
1858342	1859683	We always want to make a good movie.
1863287	1868333	In the past, the game companies never co-promoted the movie or even had a new game come out with a movie.
1869412	1873115	Uwe, those guys could have promoted the movies all they wanted to.
1873536	1879641	They could have had the money pouring out their butts, but if the movie sucked, that's not going to suddenly make the movie better.
1879961	1888789	There's probably a reason they didn't promote the movie, because when they saw it, they probably said, why did we ever sign over the rights to this god-awful man?
1889109	1891572	I could fart a better movie than he could direct.
1891592	1896356	They included free copies of the PC version of Blood Rain, and it's still in that cell, Blood Rain, the DVD.
1896786	1900328	Well, actually, I guess the BloodRayne DVD sold okay, but that's because no one saw it in the theaters.
1900689	1902310	Because everyone heard that one chick was naked.
1903550	1905612	I bet you that's why they sold two million copies.
1905932	1910995	But, you know, do like the rest of us and just see it on a website for free.
1913257	1918740	But, you know, it's kind of funny that he mentions Far Cry and stuff, because I really hope they don't kill that franchise.
1919061	1925745	You know, they can go ahead and kill all these other ones that have been dead for a long time, but just stay away from any of the good franchises.
1927031	1934276	Whenever Uwe Boll manages to make its way into our show script for what stories we're going to read, I feel a little dead inside.
1934936	1940020	That makes me very angsty, so I think it's an appropriate time for us to bring on the FUs of the week, don't you think?
1940360	1941261	Yes.
1953489	1955571	FU goes towards money.
1957458	1958138	Damn money.
1958739	1960280	Damn having to pay for everything.
1961721	1965583	And you know, I am an advocate of working hard for the things that you want.
1967024	1974910	But damn the fact that I have to shell out $415 tomorrow to pay for my first deposit for school and my books.
1975930	1980213	And then I have to do another $285 and another $285 and another $285 until I'm done.
1981014	1982855	Which I'll be done at the end of March.
1983328	1990810	And you know, a $1400 gamble to make an extra $17,000 a year working less hours is awfully nice.
1991770	1996771	But at the same time, that's a lot of money right now.
1996791	1999851	I mean, I got a few rents.
2000691	2001772	So yeah, fuck money.
2002672	2005492	Blackboy says, boohoo, DarkSakura has to pay for school.
2005512	2007453	You know what, I've been paying for school.
2007733	2012154	I've been in college now off and on over the past 10, 11 years or so.
2014136	2016637	and I finally found something that... That's a lot of off and on.
2016877	2017578	Hey, you know what?
2017958	2020299	I found something that I really, really want to do.
2021500	2023961	And I think that it'll pay off.
2024741	2031885	But for right now, you know, I'm entitled to sit back, look at this and say, how the hell am I going to steam this?
2032665	2034206	So, I'm going to make it work.
2034266	2034886	It'll be worth it.
2034906	2039148	But at the same time... Now you just got called a career student.
2039688	2040949	I am... You know what?
2041449	2043250	My theory is to never stop learning.
2044102	2051467	Honestly, the moment that you stop learning and let yourself fall into stagnant ignorance is the day you should just shoot yourself in the head.
2051727	2056890	Well, it's a good thing we fill your head full of news every week on this program so you can consistently learn something new.
2057331	2059012	I am proud to be a career student.
2059372	2064055	No matter how long I work, no matter what I do, I'm still going to be learning something.
2064255	2067117	I'm a teacher, kind of, so did I get props?
2067257	2067537	No.
2068978	2069598	Go to school.
2069919	2070379	Loki.
2071179	2073301	One lesson I hope that was learned today was...
2073945	2083091	The kids out front of your apartment complex, fuck you them for being dumb enough to leave their remote-controlled car parked in an empty space.
2083831	2087053	So when I pulled my car in there, I crushed the car and the kid cried.
2087794	2090175	And it's just like, my car, it's crushed!
2090235	2092857	Well, you're a dumbass and you left it in the space.
2093838	2095298	I feel no remorse for you.
2097580	2100602	That'll teach you to put away your damn toys and stop playing in the goddamn streets.
2102298	2103859	If I went to stripping school, would that count?
2104199	2104439	Yes.
2104939	2105300	Cool.
2105320	2106200	You'd be learning a skill.
2107321	2108701	A necessary job function.
2108961	2111243	They could eventually make you, like, a dollar.
2111283	2113984	I would probably make more money doing that than I do what I do now.
2114944	2116565	I gotta lose my little pooch here.
2116585	2120207	If you do exercise, if you do exercise, and you get free drinks.
2120267	2121268	Maybe I should look into it.
2121428	2124209	I just don't want to have to grow my hair out to look like Thunder Down Under.
2124229	2125050	You have to wax.
2125250	2126751	Yeah, that's true.
2127091	2129112	We're talking about that over a bagel this morning.
2129772	2131113	Why is this on our program?
2131393	2131493	Um,
2132270	2141235	I want to say an F you to these kettle chips that are Tuscan three cheese flavor because I've almost eaten the whole freaking bag sitting right here and that's not healthy.
2142696	2150160	I love how I'm talking about exercising and working out and I'm like, and I just ate a whole bag of potato chips and I wonder why I'm fat.
2152061	2153221	They're like really good chips though.
2153241	2154782	An F you to having no self-control.
2156403	2156923	Kill me now.
2156943	2157544	Okay, thanks.
2157924	2159044	They're really good chips though.
2159465	2160825	They're like the best chips in the world.
2160845	2161346	Kill me now.
2161386	2161846	I want to die.
2162506	2165788	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2185328	2193811	There is actually, they were actually saying that they were, that it was going to be written by Neil Gaiman, but he's actually said on his blog that he actually doesn't really have any involvement in it.
2196012	2201214	From what I understand, I think he might be a consultant, but I don't think he's actually involved much in the actual thing.
2201254	2203855	But hey, Silent Hill, happy.
2205336	2207417	You probably like the movie more than anyone else I know.
2207777	2209018	I've seen it four times in the theater.
2209038	2209698	Oh my god.
2210438	2212039	And I'm going to be buying the Blu-ray disc soon.
2212379	2212579	Yeah.
2213143	2217551	So I can turn off all the lights and go... Worship Pyramid Head?
2217651	2218733	Build a Shrine of Fire?
2219495	2222901	I don't know why everyone thinks that I'm this big Red Pyramid fangirl.
2223282	2223923	Because you are.
2224885	2225165	No.
2226898	2231141	I love the entire story, the entire feel of the game.
2231181	2233422	I love the whole mythology behind it.
2233442	2238726	But Pyramid Head, Red Pyramid, whatever, symbolizes all of that in one fancy little hot body.
2238746	2242068	Red Pyramid is the guy in the second game's repressed sexuality.
2242488	2245250	Because he goes around raping all the female monsters.
2245290	2245891	OMG, spoilers!
2246451	2247071	Oh, come on.
2248092	2249913	The game's been out for, what, five years?
2250974	2252115	I think people should know by now.
2252775	2253476	Guess what?
2253696	2253916	What?
2254591	2256632	Red Pyramid kills Dumbledore.
2258393	2259194	You're done.
2259334	2261735	Speaking of jokes that are years old, thank you for that.
2264697	2269280	Anyways, so something that doesn't have to do with rape or Silent Hill.
2269960	2272041	Nintendo was... All of them, forget it.
2272081	2272682	I don't want to hear it.
2273542	2274002	Moving on.
2274623	2275023	Just kidding.
2275558	2283480	Nintendo has partnered up with MMO producer Nexen, and really there's no news other than just that.
2283920	2296004	They don't really know why they partner up, but it seems to be that the general consensus is they're working on new MapleStory, MapleStory DS, or possibly MapleStory Wii.
2296404	2297344	So that should be interesting.
2298245	2303086	I'm always for more games, and especially if it's going to be an MMO, that would be pretty cool too.
2304042	2309165	Why am I not surprised that if Nintendo was going to partner up with any MMO maker, it would be the folks that made MapleStory?
2310266	2311126	It's very interesting.
2311387	2314108	What do you think we might have in store for us on the Wii?
2314529	2317951	I've never thought of an MMO on a Nintendo system.
2317991	2321993	I mean, it's never really happened before, with the exception of Phantasy Star Online on the GameCube.
2322294	2325055	But let's face it, Nintendo really didn't support that the way they should have.
2325436	2331039	So that fluke aside, there's not really been MMOs on Nintendo systems that I can think of.
2331099	2332400	So this is very interesting to me.
2333444	2334304	Yeah, I don't know.
2334484	2339125	I was surprised that they weren't actually partnering up.
2339145	2340285	What was that one wiki?
2341766	2349807	Because that kind of looked very similar to Wind Waker, so that would be kind of funny if they took that over and made a game based on that.
2349847	2357529	But MapleStory, based on the graphics of the game and stuff, I think that it would fit on Nintendo console pretty well.
2358689	2362630	I would like to see it as a Wii game because I think you might need a little bit more
2364996	2367017	Processor Power to actually put out the graphics and stuff.
2367237	2369838	Plus, I don't know how well a DS MMO would work.
2369858	2371338	Especially if you've got to pay for it.
2371358	2372418	You don't know unless you try.
2372918	2373158	True.
2373719	2375219	You know, who knows what they could come out with.
2375279	2379380	I would think a game like Ragnarok might actually work really well in the DS.
2379480	2380080	Sad but true.
2380100	2382261	Be very interesting.
2383401	2391783	Anyhow, one thing we resolved to do in the year 2007 is that we're not showing PC gaming enough love on this program and some folks have brought that to our attention.
2392182	2392562	PC Gaming Stories
2407646	2413131	and this actually was recently announced by PC Gamer and PC Zone Magazines.
2413611	2420657	There's a new Oblivion expansion on the way called The Shivering Isles and it only has been confirmed, well, through this, for the PC so far.
2420697	2422338	We don't know if this is going to come out on 360 yet.
2422358	2423459	Yeah, I think it is.
2424059	2425040	I imagine it would.
2425080	2426361	I mean, Oblivion does very well on the 360, but
2427478	2430040	Anyhow, for now we know it's probably going to make its way to the PC.
2430620	2437526	It will let players explore the Isles, which are divided into northern and southern areas titled Mania and Dementia.
2437886	2439227	Boy, this sounds like a fun place to go.
2440107	2445872	Then you'll be able to go to a door on this... The way you get there is you go through this door...
2446332	2447674	Thank you for watching!
2467344	2468565	Some of the new monsters in the game.
2468605	2469445	The Gatekeeper.
2470206	2472487	A collection of body parts that have been stitched together.
2472987	2473328	Awesome.
2473728	2476509	And the Knights of the Order, which are made up of three roots.
2476970	2478971	I'm surprised you're not playing more Oblivion.
2478991	2480892	Because you can set fire to anything in that game, Jamie.
2481632	2482753	Play more Oblivion?
2483173	2486075	No, I mean, I know you haven't even played it really at all.
2486135	2488657	I'm surprised by that, because I would think you'd enjoy it.
2488997	2489677	But maybe it's just me.
2489817	2491999	Well, I'm not going to have any time over the next three months, that's for sure.
2493453	2493873	I guess, yeah.
2493973	2495013	Bye-bye life.
2495193	2500595	As if your life hadn't been sucked away enough into Oblivion as it is if you've been playing this game.
2500955	2504316	Now they're just going to have this, which is even more hours gone away.
2504596	2506756	It's amazing the types of things that people made for Oblivion.
2506776	2511017	There's an Oblivion wiki out there, a Google Map style thing for Oblivion.
2511517	2512098	It's crazy.
2513018	2513778	Excuse me, it's crazy.
2514258	2514718	Bless you.
2515118	2515318	Sorry.
2516279	2516759	Live radio.
2517299	2517719	We sneeze.
2518999	2520860	Well, I have some news.
2521500	2522280	PC related?
2524787	2535377	Actually, yep, Sony Online Entertainment is releasing, they actually have the open beta for Vanguard Saga of Heroes.
2536798	2549610	It was available on the 5th, and they also have a pre-order campaign that's given to anyone who is given access to the open beta.
2550683	2559226	Some of the websites have had a lot of coverage on this Vanguard game, and it looks like it could be pretty interesting if you're into those types of PC MMOs.
2559926	2563168	So I might check it out if I have some time, if I can pull myself away from Oblivion.
2563328	2564168	That's kind of pretty.
2564748	2564888	Yeah.
2565409	2577773	Well, one game I'm looking forward to, especially even on the PC, and I know they're making a 360 version, which is awesome, but Command & Conquer 3, Tiberian Wars, they're going to get a special edition called the Kane Edition.
2578033	2579854	And for those who may not have played Command & Conquer...
2580253	2582814	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2602757	2615141	and exclusive in-game content, which is kind of cool, as well as strategy guides, deleted scenes, and bloopers from the game's live-action sequences.
2615981	2624224	And, of course, some of the exclusive content, you'll get exclusive multiplayer maps, three exclusive unit skins, and a limited edition poster.
2625524	2627585	So, that'll be pretty cool.
2629547	2635750	Going back to something I said earlier, because I'm reading the comments in the chat room right now, ShadowsLiar says, Sky, how is that crazy?
2635810	2639591	Many games have their own wiki, in reference to what I was saying, that Oblivion has all that crazy stuff out there.
2640112	2641112	I guess that's true.
2641332	2647915	I mean, there are a lot of fan communities, with wiki being open source and everything, many fan communities throw up their own wiki.
2648275	2651657	But I guess I felt like the Oblivion one just felt so vast.
2651697	2654118	I mean, because there's so much in that freaking game.
2654158	2657019	There's not a lot of games I can recall playing that...
2657299	2659581	The PC version can get them all run around topless.
2679791	2682012	Well, you did the mods and everything on the PC one, too.
2682072	2687734	I really should be playing Oblivion on the PC, not the 360, but I'm such an achievement points whore, I can't help myself.
2687754	2689775	You know, I really do want to get the Oblivion now for the PC.
2689835	2690155	You should.
2690175	2691455	I think you should put it on my laptop.
2692235	2692536	Might be.
2692816	2693676	I can put the mods in.
2694216	2695497	That's what I'm all about, is mods.
2696057	2698057	Well, so PC gamers, don't say we don't love you.
2698077	2702439	And, you know, another thing maybe we need to resolve to do is give a little love to
2703303	2704004	DarkSakura.com
2721764	2725067	But unfortunately, the only mobile story we got for you this week is a little bit of a downer.
2725847	2733393	Microsoft is being sued by a French company, Infusio, for the wrongful termination of a $2 million contract.
2734033	2743860	Infusio is claiming that Microsoft was refusing to approve their game designs, wrongfully withholding the second of four $500,000 US dollar payments.
2744301	2750105	And this is all in regards to the Halo mobile game that I suppose is in development, so...
2751044	2751684	and DarkSakura.
2787086	2790188	The first email comes from Tim Surugi.
2791449	2792250	Hello, LLR.
2792610	2794932	Of course, loving the show and hoping it never ends.
2795112	2795412	Never.
2796173	2799915	It's always nice to hear y'all's charming personalities shine every week.
2800536	2804999	I'm terribly sorry for bothering y'all, but Sky's suggestion got me thinking about gambling games for the Wii.
2805600	2809983	If Nintendo ever decides to get on the ball and make some Wii DS connectivity set up,
2810526	2815889	You could very easily expand the playability of Wii gambling titles, such as playing poker or blackjack.
2816409	2820151	Combine this with online capabilities, and I believe there could be a fulfilling Wii title.
2820451	2822192	Heck, Wii clubhouse games, why not?
2823873	2831657	The point is Nintendo's stubborn lack of celerity in grasping the online world is mind-bogglingly nonsensical.
2832337	2835839	Given Xbox 360's success through live, Nintendo could really take a hint.
2836459	2839681	On a side note, a four-star sequel utilizing Wii DS connectivity would
2840535	2841316	JustPlainRock.
2841756	2844518	Thanks for being so awesome and putting up with my annoying emails.
2845098	2845479	P.S.
2845619	2849442	You think Nintendo could reach out to the older community with games like Wii R Old?
2850462	2853304	I'd like to get some mad shuffleboard action going on.
2855106	2855786	Wii Old!
2856587	2860089	To give credit where credit is due, wasn't that your idea, Loki, for the gambling games on the Wii?
2860109	2860830	I don't remember.
2861130	2861951	I don't remember saying that.
2862011	2862451	Maybe I did.
2862851	2864612	No, I never said anything about gambling games.
2864793	2865893	All right, well, I guess I did.
2866093	2868895	They have, was it World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions?
2868916	2869436	Well, that sucks.
2869616	2872398	Well, I think they're talking, we're talking like real money being gambled.
2872458	2878322	But, you know, I think that would be a gray area that Nintendo, you know... Technically, gambling is illegal in Japan.
2878723	2880924	Well, that and that, think about that.
2881425	2887529	Usually those online gambling sites, you kind of associate that with shadiness.
2887949	2891512	You know, like, you know, there's so many of them out there and you always kind of see the pop-up ads and you go...
2892012	2892993	That's a little shady to me.
2893033	2893853	I don't know if I want to get in.
2893893	2897916	Not to knock it if that's what you're into, but I'm sure you've done the research if you're going to spend money on it.
2898176	2900858	But you have to admit, there's a lot of crap out there that seems really shady.
2901218	2905861	So I wouldn't think Nintendo would want to damage their reputation with that.
2906221	2920730	Now, along the lines of what you say, like clubhouse games and those types of very casual games, I think Xbox Live hit a goldmine with Uno, and I think Nintendo, if they were smart, would be quick to get out a version of clubhouse games on the Wii or something like that.
2921010	2923471	That kind of latches on to that where people could really do it.
2923771	2930073	But at the same time, I don't know if Wii is set up for that same type of online greatness, at least in what we know.
2930113	2933313	I mean, there might be unannounced things we don't know of yet, like there was on DS.
2933554	2936814	We didn't know that we'd be able to talk on the DS in certain games.
2937595	2946097	But Microsoft really has this rock-solid thing set up with Live, and Nintendo is being a little slow about competing with that.
2946317	2949598	And the longer they take, the further ahead
2950694	2951294	The next email says,
2978146	2984792	Just thought I'd add to the anecdotal evidence that the PS3 is not selling as well as Sony and the mainstream media would like you to believe.
2985553	2993140	In my continuing search for the Wii, I stopped into the usual big box stores, as well as GameStop, EB Games, locations in my area fairly regularly.
2993500	2996903	This Saturday morning, I got up early and made my rounds once again.
2997384	3004030	At every stop on my journey, EB Games, Target, Walmart, Circuit City, Best Buy, there were PS3s to be had, but not a single Wii in sight.
3004571	3008634	The Best Buy still has PS3s in stock from last week's flyer announcement.
3009135	3025748	I find this quite interesting and have to believe that the way too high price point, lack of killer apps, and mounting bad press is really affecting the PS3 sales, while, at least at this moment, the Wii has all the momentum necessary to sell every single unit put on the shelf, with people clamoring for more.
3026649	3028951	Two other small tidbits to note from the Saturday trip.
3029431	3031873	I was not the only person scavenging the stores for the Wii.
3032575	3039000	At several of my stops, I saw the same early 40s lady and her mother also hoping to score an early morning Wii.
3039080	3039781	Pardon the pun.
3040441	3049869	The other tidbit is that while I was wandering aimlessly through the Target, a woman came in, purchased an Xbox 360 system while bypassing the two 60 gigabyte PS3s on display.
3049969	3050690	Sorry, Sony.
3051170	3052591	Keep up the good work on the podcast.
3052631	3058096	Your show is one of the two or three I look forward to every week as it makes my daily grind that much easier to bear.
3058456	3059437	Thanks and take care.
3059997	3060958	Boston OLR fan.
3062011	3062731	Well, thank you.
3063472	3066113	Again, we kind of got into it a little bit earlier on the show.
3066213	3074636	I think now that Christmas is over, I don't think the demand for the PlayStation 3 is so much there, and I think the media fear has a lot to do with that.
3075216	3076017	Very interesting, though.
3076077	3078097	Yeah, the Nintendo is still going.
3078538	3080478	But again, I'd be very interested to see.
3080759	3085520	I think we know that Nintendo has more systems out there at this time than Nintendo or Xbox did this far out.
3085761	3088522	I mean, than Sony or Microsoft did this far out after launch.
3089042	3089262	But
3090241	3092582	I just think it would be interesting still to see the comparison there.
3093322	3098164	But I do think it is pretty obvious that Nintendo's kicking some serious booty right now.
3098885	3099605	But it's price.
3099845	3100845	It's all about the price.
3101826	3102626	This one's a quickie.
3102706	3103847	Just a random wee question.
3103867	3105827	What do they call the nunchuck attachment in England?
3105847	3107248	I believe it's still called the nunchuck.
3108188	3110569	Which I still think is a... Who is that from?
3110669	3111050	Same person?
3111290	3112030	No, different person.
3112890	3113390	It wasn't signed.
3114971	3119593	I don't read out email addresses or names through email, so if it's not signed, I won't say your name.
3120323	3124227	Hello, OLR, I've been an avid listener of your show ever since I heard my friends talk about it around episode 175.
3140413	3140713	Oh, my bad.
3161255	3162576	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3181583	3182284	Hello, OLR.
3182484	3183585	Once again, it's me, Neki.
3183765	3185706	The New Year show was great, by the way.
3185947	3186267	Thank you.
3186307	3186747	It was fun.
3186947	3187788	Thanks.
3188308	3191591	Has anyone heard the news about the PSP Lite?
3192111	3196815	I was also included a link from NewstechSpy.com.
3197595	3203260	The rest of the URL is articles06, sonypsi.html.
3203820	3207283	The Wii is very hard to find over here at the moment and is a right pain.
3207683	3209985	I can't find any store with any in stock yet.
3210933	3211913	for £180.
3212153	3218575	I have to say, though, I was very tempted to get an Xbox 360 after playing Saints Row yesterday.
3219055	3222696	Maybe I should get a 360 now and get a Wii later when there's better games out.
3222776	3223356	Your thoughts?
3223996	3226956	I'm enjoying my DS at the moment and hoping to keep doing so.
3227317	3229837	If you haven't already, check out Metroid Prime Hunters on DS.
3229917	3230317	It's fun.
3230357	3231157	Talk to you later, Neki.
3232478	3233078	Thanks for the email.
3234997	3239420	There was something in there I was going to say, and now I forgot because I got sidetracked.
3239440	3241241	Just buying a 360 now and get a Wii later?
3244213	3245154	3.60s are really good.
3245214	3253519	Again, it all comes down to, and if you've been listening to the show for any length of time, we always say this, the golden rule of gaming is a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
3253539	3254579	That's the golden rule of gaming.
3254879	3257561	So it's really about what types of games do you want to be playing right now.
3257601	3262063	If you want to play Zelda, you want to play Trauma Center, you want to play WarioWare, you've got to go for the Wii.
3262184	3272650	If you want to be playing, I mean, you said you played Saints Row, and if that was fun to you, and you want to play other types of sandbox games like that that are on their way to 3.60s, such as Grand Theft Auto later this year, you've got to go for the Wii.
3273570	3284253	and some of the other Gears of War whatever else 360 has to offer Oblivion, Pinata, whatever maybe that's the system for you and if you're an online gamer
3285240	3286241	360 is where it's at.
3286601	3291966	If you have a soft spot in your heart for the retro classics, Wii is where it's at for the Nintendo stuff.
3291986	3294067	So it's really about what you want.
3294127	3295749	But be careful.
3295829	3302454	I know how sometimes money burns a hole in your pocket and it makes you make rash decisions, and I've done this many, many times, especially with game purchases.
3302835	3308299	But you'll thank yourself if you take five minutes to really think about what you buy before you buy it.
3310117	3319135	Saka's last email Hi guys, hope your new years was good and either peaceful or eventful in a good way that's a nice way to phrase it um
3319540	3326104	I had a long thought to state, but considering my throat is coughing up furballs and other dryness, I figured just to get into it.
3326305	3331408	Playing OEB Agents, I've managed to get to the third difficulty level and noticed something.
3331688	3341294	The final songs in particular, Without a Fight and the Jumpin' Jack Flash cover, I noticed how it just matched the mood of the scenario, even getting goosebumps when the songs were being played.
3341815	3346458	It got me to think about some of the boss slash climactic battles in video games over the years.
3347216	3350118	How listening to the music just adds to the battle to make it more memorable.
3350499	3353701	So I was wondering what were some of your favorite songs used in boss battles?
3354282	3361828	Well, that's all for now as my throat is causing me to my head to be cloudy right now.
3362308	3363509	See you guys at the chat room.
3363569	3364851	And that's a DDR dollar bill.
3366352	3369454	You've actually become one of my good Doctor Who fandom buddies.
3370455	3371296	Um, uh...
3372455	3376159	And what you say there, again, is another great... I actually agree.
3376219	3378981	I thought those songs fit the mood so well in Lead Beat Agents.
3379342	3385608	And yet another reason why I think it is a travesty that that game is not ending up on more best of 06 lists.
3385688	3388891	I think it was seriously one of the absolute best games.
3389011	3390513	I'm sorry, it's better than Guitar Hero 2.
3390953	3391233	It is.
3391494	3391994	It really is.
3393335	3403418	I guess that's my opinion, take it or leave it, but I think the game is being horribly underlooked, and I think people are passing off the song list without really sitting down and trying it.
3403718	3411941	Because I'll tell you what, if you got turned off by the fact that it has Ashley Simpson, La La, or Avril Lavigne, Sk8er Boi, trust me, the music fits better than you're giving it credit for.
3413181	3413962	You know, give it a try.
3414062	3414442	Give it a try.
3415003	3416824	And yeah, those songs really fit the mood.
3416884	3417524	One Winged Angel.
3417685	3420907	Yeah, I was going to say, hello, Final Fantasy VII, One Winged Angel.
3420947	3422708	I mean, who doesn't remember, you know, the Sephiroth?
3422748	3426031	I mean, we still use that music on this program today.
3426051	3426972	That's the Advent Children version.
3426992	3429634	That is like the epic boss battle music.
3432697	3435800	I mean, yeah, this is the Advent Children one in particular, but, you know, who?
3436080	3438342	What a badass music.
3438502	3446569	I remember, though, because how long that took, because I did the Knights of the Round Quadra magic combo, just casting it, going and making a sandwich, and hearing one Wing Angel in the background.
3446589	3447130	It was really cool.
3450055	3455577	If I want to go way old school, think about some of the 8-bit games that had some great final boss music.
3455937	3462840	And I don't know, one that sticks out in my mind for whatever awkward reason, I think just one of the first songs I remember, was Remember Super Mario Bros.
3463220	3469002	2, when you finally made it to Wart, and you fought him, and it had some pretty cool final boss battle music.
3469542	3470382	It was pretty cool.
3471222	3472683	It sticks out in my mind for whatever reason.
3473243	3475224	I also do have to say...
3477638	3483423	I really... Oh, and it's how ironic Junami actually just mentioned both of them.
3483803	3489287	I was going to say all of the Wily stage musics in the various Mega Man, Rock Man games.
3489367	3489908	I was noticing that.
3489928	3491589	DMN said that too, yeah.
3491689	3500296	I fully, fully agree with... Especially two... The first one actually was even decent, but the Mega Man games just had awesome music, you know, at any rate.
3501037	3502137	I also...
3504221	3506885	The Genova Battle in Final Fantasy 7
3523126	3532168	ShadowCharlie says Final Battle Music for Sonic 3 GS68 says Destination Blackout from MT2 Ranma says Bowser Theme from Mario Bros.
3532628	3537829	3 GS68 says the Final Battle Music from Final Fantasy 4 Lots of different suggestions there.
3538009	3542070	I do have to agree with the Chrono Trigger ones, just the Lavos battle.
3543570	3547751	I especially love just going after you've beaten the game a few times on New Game+.
3548581	3552844	Going back and just doing it right away, and then you get the Maker's ending.
3553484	3555645	Or even better, The Legend of Max.
3556706	3557166	No!
3557266	3558047	For DDR?
3558527	3559027	Kinda.
3559427	3559868	Kinda.
3560768	3562049	Actually, Guitar Room Man.
3563230	3566772	The last level music in Guitar Room Man was pretty hardcore.
3566812	3574016	To me, those songs don't invoke that same emotional response that I think was alluded to in the email, but I don't know.
3575253	3575773	Any more emails?
3576134	3576494	One more?
3576634	3580016	Yes, we do have one more email.
3581516	3583798	And this one comes from Holy Shonen.
3586059	3588320	Dear OLR, I'm a huge fan.
3589101	3592222	Have enjoyed your show greatly for the past year and a half.
3592302	3593863	Just recently started being in the chat room.
3593903	3594644	Don't call me a noob.
3595024	3596044	We call people noobs.
3596185	3596505	Noob!
3596525	3597825	With the biggest of affection.
3597905	3599446	No, I know, yeah.
3600447	3602168	We say noob less than three.
3602788	3604269	Less than three, that's a heart on its side.
3605612	3608954	Anyway, I was wondering if you could help me with a problem I'm having.
3609575	3611676	My desktop just died and I need a new one.
3612256	3617100	Since my desktop would be for gaming, music, movies, etc., I was thinking of getting a PC.
3617520	3624765	However, since I love my MacBook so much, I thought I could get a good Mac with two operating systems so that my PC-only games actually run on it.
3625125	3626286	I'm not sure I need advice.
3626526	3627086	Always weird.
3627166	3627867	Holy shonen.
3627907	3628247	P.S.
3628347	3631969	Loki, I love you, but I cannot support your hatred of Mac computers.
3632450	3632830	Smiley.
3634378	3635558	Smiley, Loki, smiley.
3636339	3642201	This is something that I was going to do, except it was a little cost prohibitive for me at this junction in my life.
3643401	3652885	Also, given that I have a massive library of PC-only stuff, and we've got the parts sitting in my garage to actually build me a new computer.
3653285	3658667	I was going to get the 24-inch widescreen iMac and dual-formatted PC and...
3659580	3659981	and Mac.
3660962	3663344	You can run virtual PC as well.
3664745	3668189	Don't know how well it works on the new builds and what is my laptop doing?
3669790	3673234	For me, it's a little early for that whole dual format thing for me.
3673274	3676097	It's still kind of a new technology in my mind and I think
3676977	3678198	I'm not ready for that, you know?
3678258	3681338	It's the same as having Linux and Windows on the same box.
3681358	3681919	It's the same.
3682339	3683759	But I wouldn't do that to my machine.
3684019	3686260	It's the same as having two different versions of Windows.
3687000	3687980	Look, let me just put it this way.
3688200	3693582	Me, personally, I have a... I don't even know the name of my frickin' little... What is that, an iBook?
3693802	3694242	The laptop?
3694262	3694982	Yeah, you have an iBook.
3695062	3695623	I have an iBook.
3696063	3698824	I have an iBook, and I just call it my Apple laptop.
3698844	3701424	I have an iBook, and I have a PC desktop, and I love it.
3701644	3702465	I love that setup.
3702645	3703845	I have the best of both worlds.
3704491	3705772	I recommend folks do the same.
3706052	3706633	I think it's great.
3707113	3707713	It's a great combo.
3708454	3713898	The only real reason that I was really wanting the Mac stuff myself is being a graphic artist.
3714479	3718962	But honestly, I've done great quality work on my PC.
3720123	3723705	At this point in my life, it's really a matter of your preference.
3723765	3729350	I think if you are doing graphics professionally, video editing professionally, Mac is the way to go.
3729910	3733793	But if you're doing it for yourself or casually like me, then I don't see
3734562	3735642	as much of a point in it.
3735902	3737023	I think they're great systems.
3737403	3739303	I think it just depends on what you want to do with it.
3741084	3742684	And I like how much space they save.
3743024	3747006	I got a private message from someone that said, you know, it's just doable booting.
3747046	3748486	What's what's the big reservation?
3748626	3748946	I don't know.
3749006	3751807	I just I still, you know, maybe I'm being stupid with it.
3751867	3755348	And you're right that, you know, folks do Linux and Windows and that stuff all the time.
3755408	3756288	So what's the big deal?
3756768	3757228	I don't know.
3757348	3759009	I just I don't.
3759938	3760438	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3777100	3781681	One thing I do use my Macintosh for a lot is I author DVDs.
3781721	3784821	My really good friend John takes a lot of pictures and I make DVDs out of them.
3785181	3786482	The Mac is awesome for that.
3786522	3789142	I love it compared to anything I've tried on the PC.
3789922	3790562	Little things like that.
3790882	3792423	But see, I get all that out of my laptop.
3792463	3794743	So I don't have the need for this whole dual boot thing.
3794783	3797824	And to me, it's kind of a waste of resources.
3797884	3798604	For me, personally.
3798624	3801144	I'm not criticizing anyone else who wants to do it, but I'm just saying for me.
3801304	3803805	Jaded in here runs for operating systems.
3804285	3805645	And actually, what I was thinking about...
3806417	3809539	about doing myself, because I actually want to learn Linux a little bit better.
3810180	3818146	When we rebuild my new computer, I'm actually going to have two... My plan is to have two 20 gig hard drives in it as my boot drives.
3818987	3834238	One with Linux, one with... My new system is going to be... I can run Vista on it, so I'm taking out my 250 right now, putting it in a USB case, which ironically, the one I'm looking at is called Metal Gear.
3834258	3835159	Yeah.
3836150	3847078	and having that be portable between my laptop and my PC so that anything that I want, anything I need to do, there it is and 20GB will easily store the programs I want to run.
3850700	3851300	Any more emails?
3851881	3853582	No, but this proves that we're big dorks.
3854122	3855003	I guess, a little bit.
3855680	3861064	All right, if you have more emails you want to send, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send them.
3861144	3868388	And we also offer and welcome interaction through our Skype line, which will be open very soon after another little chunk of stories here.
3868408	3870350	So you might want to get your Skype fired up.
3870390	3874512	It's username orangeloungeradio or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3874532	3875713	We'll let you know when those are open.
3876094	3878515	But we have a couple quick final stories here for you.
3879476	3879776	Loki.
3880316	3881077	Of course, big one.
3882848	3885389	GameStop purchased Rhino Video Games
3912219	3914040	So, lots of good stuff there.
3914440	3919783	But it is official, the Blockbuster-owned company, Rhino Video Games, has been bought by GameStop.
3920423	3924525	And, you know, this isn't really huge news, I think.
3925305	3926065	Well, for you it is.
3926085	3929847	Well, for me it's not, because we've kind of known that something like this is going to happen.
3930668	3930848	Really?
3930868	3935090	Blockbuster's been entertaining offers for a while now for Rhino Video Games.
3935510	3937131	I know because we sell to them, so...
3938829	3943091	It's kind of a disappointment to see them being bought up because I hear they're a very good store chain, but
3962389	3963409	Where do they exist mostly?
3963449	3964590	We don't have them here in California.
3964610	3971453	The southeast, no, the southern east, over, you know, north, south Carolina, Georgia, Alabama.
3971493	3973153	I know, I know right now.
3973333	3976635	So, that's pretty much where, you know, they were located.
3977115	3982177	And, yeah, they had about, I want to say they had like 72 locations, if I remember correctly.
3982277	3985358	See, here in California, we've always had...
3985956	3986937	GameStop, pretty much.
3987017	3989659	Because previously we always had Software Etc.
3990199	3991080	and Funkoland.
3991480	3992781	Babbage's.
3992821	3994963	They all got absolved.
3995023	3996604	I don't remember Babbage's here in California.
3996864	3999526	Keep in mind, GameStop is also owned by Barnes & Noble Inc.
4001348	4002889	I think they're a fully owned subsidiary.
4002989	4010275	So Babbage's, since Babbage's was Barnes & Noble's arm for games and tech.
4010295	4015659	The Barnes & Noble's craze, from my recollection, did not really start here in this state until about 10 years ago.
4016448	4016988	and that whole thing.
4017389	4020071	Those stores did not start going up until about 10 years ago.
4020291	4024034	It was always Walden Books, which is Borders, essentially.
4024734	4028237	Well, apparently the whole thing's supposed to go down on the 14th.
4028797	4042147	That's when I guess it's going to become official and they're going to start... I don't know if they're going to either convert these stores over to GameStops, which I hear that might be what's going to happen, or if it's going to be like this whole GameStop EB thing where
4042611	4044232	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4073661	4075002	Um, I don't know.
4075422	4076423	I think so, actually.
4076443	4077544	I've been in a movie gallery.
4077564	4077844	Sweet!
4078664	4080525	My dad used to flirt with the lady behind the counter.
4080645	4082146	Just go to Video Clearance Center.
4082166	4083267	They have tons of porn there.
4083287	4087109	In fact, they carry more porn than, I think, actual videos now.
4087549	4091632	They actually said, I went into one and they said they had a green door that you could go behind to buy the porn.
4091952	4092952	They actually had to paint their door.
4095334	4095894	Paint it green?
4096154	4098655	Somebody raised a stink and they had to paint over the green door.
4099336	4099776	With what?
4100416	4101157	I think it's purple now.
4103002	4104243	Okay, so now it's the purple door.
4104263	4104583	What's it?
4105544	4107445	Going behind the green door to buy, never mind.
4108485	4109786	Okay, anyway, forget it.
4109966	4119391	Look, let's... This is so horrible that we have to follow up that topic with this, but hey, look, it's just the way it was scripted, folks.
4120051	4121292	Let's talk about charity.
4121372	4125694	We'll go to the opposite end of the spectrum from buying porn to donating to charity.
4127099	4132123	Of course, one charity a lot of gamers know about is Penny Arcade's Child Play charity.
4132604	4136387	And they raised over $1 million this year.
4136928	4141291	It was posted on the Child's Play website this week that, quote, You guys did it.
4141351	4143673	You broke a million dollars in just over two months.
4144014	4149539	Child's Play started as a way to show how good our community can be, but it's turned into something greater than we could have ever imagined.
4149759	4151240	We're making an impact on lives.
4151380	4152121	See you next year.
4152561	4154263	They're at $1,024,400.
4154483	4156004	That's great.
4156124	4156665	That's awesome.
4156745	4157305	Congratulations.
4158206	4175582	I think it's a damn shame the media won't ever cover that in the same capacity that they cover, I should say, you know, because I'm sure they get a nice, you know, story here and there, but in the same way that, you know, Game Boy Electrocute, Small Child, you know, kids go and shoot up their schools because of video games.
4175642	4177383	It's never going to get that same.
4177764	4179305	Documentary and...
4180238	4185759	Not really a document, but that documentary on video game violence called Moral Combat.
4189600	4193280	I think you'd find better quality behind the beaded doors in a movie gallery.
4193340	4194240	Behind the purple door.
4195501	4207203	At any rate, speaking of quality, and I vote this for quality, Guitar Hero 2 360 is going to have additional content.
4207283	4209123	They're not really saying much about it,
4210270	4217114	Rumor has it that it might be new modes, downloadable content, probably for new songs coming out, sort of like how Karaoke Revolution goes.
4218816	4224959	Putting out the original Guitar Hero songs with extra bass or, you know, rhythm guitar.
4225059	4225980	I think that'd be pretty cool.
4228802	4234385	And it does say, though, right on the box, that there are additional songs and downloadable content.
4236517	4240740	Sweet, I knew there was a reason I was holding out for this game on the 360 and this is exactly why.
4241281	4248846	And yes, I do realize I was saying things that may seem a little anti-Guitar Hero earlier in the show, but I'm really not.
4248926	4253309	I really do like Guitar Hero a lot, I just don't think it's God's gift to gaming.
4253649	4256091	I think there were better games that came out in 06 and so on, but
4257591	4258871	I've been holding out to buy this.
4259172	4260872	I've played it on PS2, and sure, it's fun.
4260912	4264213	But I've been holding out for 360, and I knew this was why.
4264233	4266694	I'm also going to link in the chat room, though.
4267655	4276658	There is a picture of this up on a Team Xbox site that has what the box art is.
4277298	4278439	So I'm posting that right now.
4279999	4280359	There you go.
4280379	4283400	The box art was very interesting looking to me, I have to say.
4284501	4285021	But very cool.
4285041	4285361	I liked it.
4286215	4287196	I'm looking forward to it.
4287256	4288317	You know I'm going to get it anyway.
4288657	4289077	I know you will.
4314736	4320819	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4320859	4321279	Who's this?
4322320	4322720	It's Nim.
4323220	4323720	Oh, Nim.
4323820	4324241	Hi, Nim.
4324281	4324961	What's on your mind, buddy?
4326742	4327362	Not much, really.
4327382	4329023	I didn't expect to get through.
4329843	4330524	Well, you did.
4330584	4332305	You don't have anything you want to share with us tonight?
4332405	4333005	Why'd you call?
4334426	4336287	Oh, yeah.
4336547	4338868	I was making a TV show.
4340489	4341510	You were making what?
4341870	4342550	The computer.
4343871	4344572	You were making what?
4344872	4345532	A new game.
4346333	4350436	Oh, you're the one that messaged Loki earlier and said you're making this game called Kibi.
4351856	4352097	Yeah.
4352317	4353137	What is this all about?
4354398	4359622	Well, um, it's going to run off of a modified version of Step Mania.
4361523	4365906	A couple of the real army is going to help us with it.
4367387	4367767	And, um,
4368243	4369323	Yeah, that's pretty much all we're doing.
4369343	4370684	We're looking for artists and such.
4371624	4373365	Have you made a post in our forums about it?
4374765	4375506	Um, no.
4375806	4377326	Right now it's pretty much underground.
4378347	4383529	Well, now you just outed it to all the folks that listen to the program, so go post on the forums.
4383549	4384369	I'm sure you can get some help.
4384749	4385709	And good luck to you on the project.
4385749	4386150	Alright.
4387170	4387830	So what is it?
4387890	4392812	It's supposed to be a Beatmania-ish game, but with DDR's interface, or...?
4395339	4396940	Turn down your radio.
4396980	4397740	Hold on a second.
4397800	4398680	Yeah, that's what I thought.
4398700	4399961	See, I can hear myself in the background.
4400341	4401302	Turn down the radio.
4402202	4403623	When you call radio programs, turn down the radio.
4403643	4405143	We should have you sing death metal for us, Rob.
4406264	4407184	That's because I love GWAR.
4407204	4407704	Damn headphones.
4407844	4408485	All right, no, that's right.
4408765	4411306	Okay, so, anyway, what was I going to say?
4413027	4416928	So this is what, DDR, it's based on a DDR interface, but it's Beatmania.
4418269	4420190	Yeah, like, have you seen the videos of...
4421438	4422079	Step Mania.
4422579	4429885	Yeah, and I always thought Step... Like, 99% of people who play Step Mania are just doing Finger Finger Revolution.
4429945	4432547	Very few people are actually hooking up dance pads to the computer.
4432927	4434549	So, I think it's a good idea.
4434649	4437991	At least make something that's actually not pretending to be actual dancing.
4439312	4439693	Yeah, I know.
4439713	4440213	That's the point.
4440814	4441134	Great!
4441314	4442675	Then I fully support this project.
4443936	4444777	Yeah.
4444817	4445638	I'll draw you a picture.
4446018	4446698	Good luck to you.
4446999	4448540	I'll do announcer packs if you need it.
4450679	4455981	Alright, thanks guys Alright, no problem, good luck with your project and keep us informed on the forums or whatever, alright?
4458282	4472048	Alright, oh, I guess he hung up If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, let's go to the phones Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
4473809	4477030	This is Paradox Vincent Hi Paradox Vincent, what's on your mind, buddy?
4479338	4493921	Well, I was picking my friend up a game at GameStop recently, and they had Game Informer at display, so I picked it up and I flipped through the reviews, and I saw they gave Wii Sports a 6.5 out of 5.
4495741	4499221	Wait, they gave Wii Sports 6.5 out of 5?
4499461	4501222	Yeah.
4502062	4503242	Is that a typo or something?
4505202	4505403	No.
4505943	4506943	How do you give a game a 6.5 out of 5?
4509933	4511394	Why do I think they gave it one?
4513777	4517440	I think they gave it one because it's not like Gears of War.
4517520	4525127	It's not this hyper-polished first-person shooter that takes years upon years to make.
4525207	4527129	It's just a simple little sports game.
4527149	4528450	You meant to say 6.5 out of 10, right?
4531713	4535095	Yeah, but the thing is that every single person that I've showed this game to, they've absolutely loved it.
4535115	4536396	And I had a... She was an older woman...
4562946	4568708	A middle-aged woman comes up to my mom and says, Hey, have you checked out Wii Bowling?
4570529	4584875	And for someone of that age to come up to another woman of similar age and discuss a video game with them, I think Nintendo's done exactly what they wanted to do in the first place.
4584915	4588436	Yeah, it's like you're living in Bizarro World for a minute when your parents are the ones talking about Nintendo.
4589096	4590597	Let me quote the review real quick.
4591378	4593259	Their basic breakdown of this.
4593379	4598500	It says the concept is an uneven intro into the system and its controllers, but at least it's free.
4599120	4603841	Graphics, they say the game uses Mii avatars on your Wii, but that's about the only eye-catching thing about it.
4604201	4608482	Sound, the tiny sound that comes from the Wii remote really starting to bug me.
4608802	4613883	It says playability, sometimes there are inconsistencies between your movement and what happens on screen.
4614164	4618325	Entertainment, this is a shallow game by design, but it does offer some occasional fun.
4618645	4620005	Replay, moderately low.
4620512	4622373	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4641417	4642137	and many more.
4666512	4677859	You remember back in the day if you ever let a non-gamer, or even some regular gamers, would play an old 8-bit game, they'd move their body with the controller, and when they jump, you'll pull back and all that stuff?
4677939	4679740	Nintendo made that a part of the game.
4681707	4684908	and when they said they were going new generation, they meant it.
4685288	4691030	And that's why I think a lot of people that have been in this line of thinking for a while are going to be in for a rude awakening pretty soon.
4691410	4694471	Nintendo is not making games necessarily for the hardcore gamer.
4694812	4703094	So, you know what, I urge you guys out there who read a lot of these reviews, and it's not just this particular one, but think about all these stories we've had lately.
4703134	4707576	We had EGM bash Elebits when it didn't really, you know, a lot of folks feel it didn't need it.
4707876	4713788	We had GameSpot, heaven forbid, didn't give Zelda a 9 or a 10 and they received the wrath of Nintendo fanboys everywhere.
4715550	4720212	I think it is very interesting that the common theme here is all Nintendo Wii games.
4720652	4723913	And the other thing, too, is people need to understand these are critics.
4724173	4725814	They don't necessarily... Exactly.
4726054	4729835	And here's a website I recommend checking out, Metacritic.com.
4730196	4733217	It's M-E-T-A-C-R-I-T-C.
4733837	4741860	And definitely check it out because they break down, they have a list of all the scores at different magazines and websites and whatnot I've published, except
4742253	4745334	We don't have anything on here.
4745394	4747615	But it does give an average and also has user averages.
4747695	4752017	And that's a really good place to look, especially if you're wondering if a game is good or not.
4752237	4756458	Don't read one magazine or a couple magazines because certain people have certain tastes in magazines.
4756478	4760440	Like, for example, if I were rating a sports game, I'd probably give it a low score because I hate sports games.
4760820	4762100	But that's not fair.
4762460	4764841	But unfortunately, there are biased reviews out there.
4764921	4769703	So that's why you need websites like this or just the kind of...
4770205	4770725	DarkSakura.com
4792797	4801283	Well, you know, then go out and find another one of the hundreds of video game podcasts that are out there being produced by independent gamers like you and me that have similar tastes.
4801643	4807867	And I think that is where things are headed, and that's why I say that the traditional gaming press is in for a rude awakening very soon.
4809969	4811590	Oh, yeah.
4812650	4813811	I've been dominating the conversation.
4813831	4814331	I apologize.
4814351	4815052	What do you think, buddy?
4817073	4818714	Yeah, I agree with you.
4818794	4822417	I think that if they are in for a rude awakening,
4823081	4832308	I'm really welcoming that because up until now, gaming has been viewed as a very nerd culture thing.
4832988	4838312	I think that just being able to interact with something that's on TV isn't evil.
4838512	4840114	It's not obscure.
4840274	4843096	It's pretty natural for me.
4844417	4850181	I think that if somebody can just sit down and have fun with a game, then
4851204	4859868	I mean, I think that's exactly what Nintendo wants them to do and that's exactly what I think they are going to and I'm hoping they're going to achieve.
4860429	4869313	Out of curiosity, outside of Nintendo Power, can anyone, whether on the phone or here in the room, think of, is there a magazine out there geared towards the casual gamer?
4870414	4870514	No.
4871652	4874614	I'm not necessarily saying that Nintendo Power is like that magazine, but you know what I mean?
4874634	4881058	Like something that would maybe give the Wii game reviews the perspective that the big boys are missing out on?
4882258	4883979	Is there any type of publication like that right now?
4884499	4885240	Not that I know of.
4885520	4886140	Maybe there ought to be.
4886461	4889062	Not specifically to gaming.
4889222	4889702	Maybe, I don't know.
4889722	4893004	Maybe they figure that because they're casual gamers, they wouldn't want to buy magazines about gaming.
4893044	4893344	I don't know.
4893805	4894385	But just kind of.
4894738	4897779	I don't know, but for a casual gamer, just like he said, Grandma's talking to Grandma about Wii Bowling.
4925555	4933041	Yeah, but see, then these people are also going to say, oh, the Wii's the best system in the fucking world because you swing around in the game and it's more interactive.
4933682	4936124	That's not a really, you know, informed decision.
4936164	4939006	That's just, you know, I see something different.
4939947	4940787	Ooh, shiny.
4940847	4942549	I mean, it's... I don't know.
4942869	4945251	It's just kind of on the other end of the spectrum.
4945311	4954058	Instead of having someone that's really hardcore into a game, you have someone reviewing a game that knows jack shit about games and they're reviewing it just, you know, because...
4954915	4956295	Nintendo Total, it's an awesome game.
4956436	4957316	Oh, it's an awesome game.
4958096	4959036	So, I don't know.
4960037	4960297	Alright.
4960917	4962978	Well, any other thoughts you want to share with our listeners?
4963118	4963778	Paradox Vincent?
4965038	4966039	Shadow Center is amazing.
4966899	4967819	It is great.
4967879	4968980	Horribly underlooked.
4969480	4972961	And if you own a Wii, you owe it to yourself to at least rent this damn game and check it out.
4974617	4998413	I think it's pretty I'm spoiled by the 360's graphics and what little I've seen of the Playstation 3 The graphics in Trauma Center, not that thrilling, but that's not the point That's not the point of Trauma Center Oh yeah I'm not surprised, once again I'm sure the mainstream gaming press kind of missed that But the game is more fun than a lot of games I've played in a long time
4998894	5001135	Anyway, we've got to let you go, Paradox Vincent, so we can take other calls.
5001155	5005016	But thanks so much for inspiring the lively chat we've had here.
5006356	5007176	All right.
5007396	5007936	Take care, buddy.
5009157	5009497	You too.
5009657	5010097	Bye-bye.
5011217	5013118	Let's go to another phone call, shall we?
5013238	5016099	Let's go to this call.
5016639	5017839	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5017879	5018259	Who's this?
5018999	5020000	This is DMN.
5020380	5020920	Oh, boy.
5021260	5022320	Hi!
5022480	5025441	You always manage to get through.
5025581	5026982	When are you coming to visit me again?
5028002	5028202	May.
5028857	5029097	Okay.
5029297	5030678	Yeah, they're planning something.
5030918	5041966	The rest of OLR's contributors are planning something big for the fifth anniversary of OLR, which, by the way, I forgot to say this at the top of the show, but this episode would mark our third year of podcasting or our third birthday.
5042046	5042166	Yay!
5042586	5043507	Yay!
5043547	5043907	Whatever.
5043967	5044528	Okay, great.
5045208	5047270	And then we were forced to eat Rob's shoes.
5047330	5049972	You can only celebrate so many landmark shows.
5050012	5050792	So anyway, whatever.
5051112	5052013	DMM, what's on your mind tonight?
5052642	5053202	Two things.
5053503	5056484	It was one, but that previous call fired up some other things.
5056985	5059026	One, I'm disappointed in the three of you.
5059966	5060247	Why?
5060407	5062528	I didn't do it!
5062848	5063468	You did, Jamie.
5063489	5063669	No!
5064833	5067195	I did not hear Okami out of any one of you three.
5067415	5068415	I didn't play Okami!
5069416	5070336	Interesting, huh?
5071077	5080423	I think it's because PS2 games, late generation PS2 games are being horribly overlooked in this, you know, last push towards the next gen of gaming.
5080463	5082024	And yeah, I guess I'm a little bit guilty of that.
5082404	5088988	But again, it's kind of one of those cases where if I had more, if I had a top 20 or a top 15, probably Okami would have made it.
5090389	5093711	Or even it could have been my number 10, but I had to say Sneak King, I had to.
5094560	5100921	Well, yeah, but, I mean, for one, Okami was my game of the year, if anybody listened to SDFU, all three of you.
5100941	5101721	No, we don't listen to it.
5102242	5104322	Okami was my game of the year.
5106262	5108823	And I was surprised that none of you guys said it.
5109823	5111303	You know what?
5111363	5115824	And there's probably 500 other people out there listening going, why didn't they rank this game higher?
5115904	5117465	Why didn't they put this game on the list?
5117525	5118165	Why not this?
5118205	5118665	Why not that?
5119045	5119505	You know what?
5119565	5123666	That's the whole point of top lists, is it's just one opinion and take it or leave it.
5125244	5127145	I'm not saying Okami's a bad game by any means.
5127225	5129125	It's fantastic, but, you know.
5129205	5131586	Okay, good, because if you said it's a bad game, I'd punch you in the face.
5131626	5132507	No, no, I don't feel that way at all.
5132787	5135327	That means you'd have to come here to do it, and then I'd have to catch it on film.
5135408	5136508	I didn't... Exactly.
5136688	5140869	I did not... Well, I left Gears of War off my top 10, and Gears of War wouldn't even be in my top 20.
5141510	5142550	But that's just me personally.
5142630	5144751	I was severely disappointed by Gears of War.
5145211	5150092	Go back and listen to me supporting Michelle from Video Game Outsiders in last week's episode.
5150112	5151113	She felt the same way I did.
5151133	5151373	It just...
5152493	5153774	It wasn't all that.
5154074	5155235	It was pretty and that's it.
5156095	5156435	To me.
5157096	5157596	But anyway.
5159117	5164539	Number two is Nintendo Power for about the past year hasn't really been catered toward the casual gamer.
5164579	5166560	They've changed their outlook on things.
5167821	5170623	I wasn't trying to say Nintendo Power was a casual gamer's magazine.
5170683	5178647	I was trying to think like what magazine is reviewing Wii games from the perspective of I am not a hardcore gamer.
5178787	5181208	I'm someone who just likes to have fun.
5182513	5184334	What gaming magazine could Nelly read?
5184975	5185595	None of them.
5185935	5186296	None of them.
5186836	5187376	I'll tell you why.
5187756	5189598	First of all, you see shitty games.
5189778	5192800	I could bring up a big example several years back.
5192860	5195201	A game for the PS2 called State of Emergency.
5195962	5197042	This game was hyped as hell.
5199464	5202986	This is when I knew one of my favorite magazines, Jump the Shark, EGM.
5203026	5207369	I believe they gave the game an 8.5.
5207789	5209710	It was one of the worst games I've ever played.
5210447	5223038	It started making me think that I think some of those developers pay off magazines to give their games good reviews, and if that is the case, I'm very sorely disappointed in gaming media.
5223178	5225760	Look at Atari and Driver 3, that's what they did.
5225921	5228423	I'm not going to go there because I don't have the proof to back it up, but...
5230610	5235091	Gaming fans are very... I mean, it's a very interesting industry.
5235391	5240153	Because, you know, you take the passion that movie fans have about movies.
5240613	5243514	You know, go to those big movie websites like, you know, Ain't It Cool News or whatever.
5243534	5245534	Just read the passion that people have for movies.
5246054	5249515	Multiply that by 100 and you have the gaming fans and the games.
5250196	5252656	So, it's something else.
5252916	5257498	I mean, and the gaming fans will respond appropriately, I think.
5257578	5259118	I don't think gaming fans are stupid.
5260822	5263803	Look at what happened with All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com.
5264063	5264723	Case in point.
5266303	5266523	Yeah.
5267343	5270824	I mean, you could also put the Halo franchise in that same limelight.
5271044	5278125	I don't think that they're 10 out of 10s as what a lot of magazines gave Halo 1 and some gave Halo 2 when it came out.
5279305	5283946	I think they're decent, but they're not like, you know, industry-changing games.
5284806	5286287	And what's funny with that, I would actually disagree.
5286327	5288667	I do think Halo 2 is a 10 out of 10 game, but that's just me.
5288687	5288987	I mean,
5290234	5293696	And I do think it's an industry-changing game, but that's, you know, again, it's opinion.
5295017	5296277	Yeah.
5297398	5298199	But that's about it.
5299059	5299359	All right.
5299559	5303742	Well, DMN, so you're going to have the guy from VG Cats on your show on Thursday, we hope?
5304322	5305263	Either this or next week.
5305343	5306123	That's what we're shooting for.
5306183	5307744	How are you landing all these big interviews?
5308024	5310986	You just smoozing, writing nice emails and all that stuff?
5311526	5315849	I... How much dick are you having to suck, I guess is what I'm asking.
5316369	5317670	Well, you taught me, so...
5321590	5326392	I must have taught you better than myself because we're not landing any of these big interviews, but you are.
5326412	5327712	So no, that's cool.
5327752	5328632	We love VG Cats.
5328692	5329652	I'm looking forward to hearing that.
5329672	5332053	Tell them that they're my favorite webcomic ever.
5332253	5335314	I'm sure he's going to take the time to point that out.
5335854	5337314	The chick on OLR loves you.
5342395	5343776	All right, DMN, have a good time.
5343796	5345596	We're going to try to get another call before we leave.
5345616	5346476	All right, have a good one.
5346536	5347157	Take care, guys.
5347277	5347497	Bye.
5347517	5347657	Bye.
5351069	5356631	If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or the Skype line is Orange Lounge Radio.
5357251	5360072	Let's try at least one more call here, maybe more if we're feeling saucy.
5361613	5363013	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5363053	5363533	Who's this?
5364694	5365394	Raven's Dolphin.
5365574	5366354	Hi, Raven's Dolphin.
5366375	5367055	What's on your mind, buddy?
5368335	5372717	I just want to say that Microsoft did not give early adopters the shaft.
5374297	5375638	They did not give who the shaft?
5376698	5377318	Early adopters.
5377338	5377699	Oh, early adopters.
5377719	5378219	Early adopters.
5378439	5378739	Okay.
5378759	5378839	Okay.
5380168	5384315	Because they did not introduce the HDMI port for the Xbox 360 XS.
5394651	5395452	No, they didn't.
5395812	5397573	They didn't even say HDMI.
5397873	5408960	They just went like, okay, this is the Xbox, this is IPTV, this is what you can do with it, this is Uno, now you can play Uno on the road, you can play Uno here, you can play Uno there, you can even play this there.
5409061	5412403	Oh yeah, I'm saying it's super bullshit now.
5412503	5413684	I don't know if it's coming later.
5417654	5420235	I'm keeping my mind open to this.
5447354	5451135	One more thing I want to tell you about that, that HDMI hookup in the back of the 360.
5451595	5452676	It ran through VGA.
5452696	5456197	It'll get up to VGA through the TV.
5456297	5457137	True, true, they do.
5458138	5459018	Well, we'll see, we'll see.
5461479	5468321	Okay, and just want to say they didn't give you the shaft, and I am now trying to get money up for Windows Vista.
5470101	5470721	Well, good luck.
5472142	5473462	I know, you're right.
5474543	5475503	All right, take care, buddy.
5476598	5477118	You too, bye.
5502918	5508344	I haven't heard you guys talk too much about portables, like DS games, except like Cooking Mama.
5509765	5510466	That would be me.
5510986	5511227	Yeah?
5511927	5513409	Yeah, my favorite game too, by the way.
5514490	5516532	So what were you hoping that we would be talking about?
5517333	5525041	I don't know, it's like, because I just started hearing you guys in November, and one of the games I wasn't sure you guys talked about was in the Castlevania series.
5525689	5535781	You know what's funny is that the last time I actually played the Castlevania game, I do still need to pick up the new one on DS, but we did get to play it in August at the little Konami thing we went to.
5535881	5540327	I really enjoyed it more than the previous DS game.
5540507	5541749	I get all the names confused.
5541769	5542710	Dawn of Sorrow, is that it?
5543150	5543970	Dawn of Sorrow was the first one.
5543990	5546191	Yeah, Dawn of Sorrow was the last one, and then this new one, Portrait of Ruin.
5546231	5547711	Portrait of Ruin I liked quite a bit.
5547831	5553713	I liked the whole fact that you had kind of the two characters, and I liked the fact that you kind of went outside the castle into other worlds.
5553773	5557855	It felt a little more like Simon's Quest, I suppose, in that regard.
5557935	5560135	Or Mario 64, where you jump into the paintings.
5560795	5562376	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, kind of like that, yeah.
5562716	5564236	So, yeah, no, it was pretty cool.
5564276	5569038	I do want to check out the final release of the game, although I'm pretty sure what we played in August was pretty close to final, so...
5569915	5571777	Yeah, I've been playing for a while.
5571817	5572958	It's really good.
5574099	5580986	I've never seen a bad... What was the other game we played that Kojima was behind on the DS?
5581046	5582067	Yeah, that hasn't come out yet.
5582107	5583188	I can't remember the name of it.
5583268	5584009	I don't know.
5584489	5584850	Damn it.
5586311	5586892	Lunar Knights.
5587012	5587973	Lunar Knights, thank you.
5588173	5588894	That was pretty decent.
5588954	5589294	I liked that.
5590054	5590614	LUNAR NIGHTS
5605126	5606226	Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins
5633496	5637258	The Gradius Collection and those other retro titles are great.
5637458	5639039	Every Extended Extra is pretty good.
5639059	5642481	Twin V Collection, which is coming out, and the Salamander Collection.
5642581	5644302	Oh, Salamander Hall.
5644642	5650946	And, of course, for Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy VI, first week in February there.
5650966	5653527	Diddy Kong Racing for the DS.
5654067	5655048	We love our handhelds.
5655128	5657689	It's just the past couple months have been mostly the systems for me.
5658170	5659010	The consoles, I should say.
5659844	5665431	Yeah, just, hmm, Warriors on PSP, I hope it plays like the Xbox and PS2 versions.
5666772	5667313	Oh, we'll see.
5668054	5671938	Yeah, I hope so, because I tried Luminous, like you said, and on the phone, actually.
5672639	5673961	Oh, what'd you think?
5674848	5678309	I couldn't really hear the music, but the gameplay was actually addicting.
5695257	5723187	especially when you consider the mobile really took some risks with the gameplay I felt that Luminous 2 was a little too much more of the same for it to be justified on the top 10 of the year but it definitely was a very solid release and if you have not played Luminous at all then it's okay to skip Luminous 1 and go right to 2 because it does have some added things and I think the additional skins and the music videos were very cool oh that was the other reason why Luminous 2 lost a lot of brownie points with me is because they recycled way too much for Luminous 1
5724144	5753361	so pretty much pretty much Luminous 2 is like Luminous 1 plus other stuff then yeah but like way more stuff and if you don't have a PSP at all you should get the Xbox Live one but I don't think you need both unless you're really a puzzle game whore like I am well not as much for me but the 360 I'll get later I'm eagerly hoping that the music artist pack and the Heavenly Star song is out very very soon it was supposed to be in January at some point so we'll see hmm
5754220	5758523	Yeah, it'll be a while for me to get it because of money and all that.
5758984	5759204	Sure.
5760084	5761105	Any other thoughts for our listeners?
5761525	5762366	DDR dollar bill?
5764327	5770691	I had a few, but I'm just still a little sick right now, so I just wanted to chime in about the portables because I never hear you guys talk about it.
5770972	5773073	Well, we try to give it a little love once in a while.
5773093	5773894	We do love our portables.
5773954	5776515	I love my DS and my PSP for certain things.
5777376	5777816	Same here.
5778217	5778517	All right.
5779217	5780418	Well, thanks so much for the call, buddy.
5780438	5780858	Keep listening.
5780878	5782379	See you guys.
5782500	5782860	All right.
5782880	5783080	See you.
5783866	5784587	Bye-bye.
5784607	5784967	Bye-bye.
5786428	5787749	Those were some good calls tonight.
5788650	5791252	Little rough starts to some of them, but we got our way through them.
5791292	5793033	So thank you guys so much for calling in tonight.
5793053	5794554	We're going to go ahead and close the Skype line.
5794594	5797457	Sorry to those that didn't get through, but we still love you.
5797477	5798117	It's just we're running.
5798137	5800739	We're almost to two hours for this segment, so we've got to wrap this crap up.
5800919	5802140	Any last-minute stories, you guys?
5802301	5802521	Yes.
5802781	5802981	Okay.
5803501	5809286	Necronasia is coming to the United States as a game called Escape from Bug Island.
5809975	5810695	Let me tell you this much.
5810735	5815197	The game is as crappy as that new title, so don't pick it up when it comes out.
5815297	5816218	It's shit.
5817058	5821520	But Eidos is producing it, so that won't be the first time that their games suck.
5821560	5822200	Let's see here.
5822681	5834086	Then, of course, there was some news also coming from CES about Vista, and this isn't really a huge surprise, that the Xbox 360 controller is going to be able to be used with Vista.
5834586	5837067	In fact, it's going to be kind of like a standard for them, so...
5839137	5840238	Big, huge surprise there.
5840858	5856884	What is kind of cool, though, is this Thursday, January 11th, there's going to be new content for Gears of War coming out, including two free maps, Raven Down, which is going to be a map set around a downed Raven helicopter, and it looks pretty.
5857644	5865267	And there's also a new map called Old Bones, which looks like a museum, which looks pretty cool.
5865714	5871118	Both of those are going to be free because they're being sponsored by, and this is weird, the Discovery Channel.
5871819	5874461	They're also giving away 2 million Microsoft points.
5875161	5878824	Doesn't Discovery HD, though, have a game special that's been airing or something?
5879204	5879524	I don't know.
5879564	5879965	I think so.
5880685	5881546	It makes a little sense to me.
5881926	5884148	So that's kind of cool, I guess.
5885729	5886209	Pretty cool.
5886510	5889952	And also there's a rumor that Nintendo is developing a wireless nunchuck.
5889972	5890533	Already.
5890573	5890853	Already.
5891820	5892581	DarkSakura, you have anything?
5892601	5892641	No.
5904910	5907233	Alright, then that brings our show to a close.
5907954	5910918	Thanks again so much for tuning in to and supporting Independent Radio, you guys.
5910958	5913221	Just a reminder, we're not live next week.
5913281	5923594	I'm sorry, live listeners, but we just have personal situations to be dealt with, and that would include I'm finally going to Disneyland with the girls, so we'll take lots of pictures and share that with you guys in the fan communities.
5924054	5952854	and Loki has that other thing which I'm just now finding out about and I really wish I could go to that so please give those two my old Final Fantasy XI buddies give them my best and best wishes and all that stuff and we will still have a new audio blog or podcast whatever you want to call it there will still be a new show that way so apologies to live listeners I know you've had to deal with a break but we promise after this week we won't be having a break for a long time a long time so if you bear with us we'll be good
5953674	5956136	Thank you guys so much for your continued support of our program.
5956176	5957618	You guys are awesome.
5957958	5959619	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
5960820	5961681	Loki, your final thought.
5962461	5969927	My final thought is there's this laser pen advertisement on this one page here, and it's cool because it shoots a giant laser.
5970408	5971869	I want a laser.
5972429	5973450	Lasers are awesome.
5974491	5975152	I guess it's shiny.
5976973	5978154	Dark Sakura, your final thought.
5979326	5990108	Um, I really, really, really, really, really am tired of drinking my own medicinal tea to make my throat work.
5990308	5996530	So, I want, um, and I want to cook something, but not right now.
5996870	5997750	I want to cook for real.
5998430	5999090	Bake me a pie.
5999910	6000651	I'll bake shepherd's pie.
6001451	6002311	I'll make good shepherd's pie.
6003186	6010094	My final thought is that Legend of Zaku says this, yay, that means you OLR listeners must watch 24 next Sunday in the show's absence.
6010674	6017402	I would actually support that because 24 is a show I need to get back into that's really good, and I'm going to TiVo it while we're gone.
6017963	6019945	People should look for us at Disneyland if they're going to be there.
6020445	6021066	Yeah, say hi.
6021166	6021887	You can't miss us.
6022875	6023295	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6051886	6052906	Orange Lounge Radio is for you guys.
