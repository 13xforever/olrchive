15480	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	26200	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 215 for this January 7th, 2007.
26200	30200	And what's going on actually right now while we're doing tonight's program and taping here
30200	34040	live on this Sunday night is that actually Microsoft is giving their keynote speech right
34040	35040	now, right?
35040	37520	Over for CES, because Consumer Electronics Show is going on?
37520	38520	Ah, yes.
38520	41720	What, Loki, you've got, you're going to start us off with part B, talking about what's going
41720	43000	on at CES right now.
43000	49360	Yeah, there's a couple big announcements made about, you know, during CES and the keynote
49360	50360	speech here.
50360	55600	Of course, as we mentioned earlier, their big announcement, of course, was partnership
55600	60480	I guess with Microsoft TV, which is an IPTV service.
60480	66400	And you're going to be able to watch TV, I guess streamed over the internet, as well
66400	71240	as record TV while playing games, which is pretty cool.
71240	75880	And no clue yet when exactly that's going to go into effect, but it's something that
75880	77720	they're going to launch this year.
77720	83800	It's going to have digital video recording capabilities for gaming, movie viewing, and
83800	86600	even voice and video chat.
86600	92160	It says, we really are going to need a big hard drive for that.
92160	98760	It says live chat while watching television, so people can watch Lost or something.
98760	102600	Oh my God, that's a bad idea.
102600	110360	Playing over Xbox Live while recording TV live in the background.
110360	116380	This isn't a huge surprise because I remember they were talking something with DirecTV before.
116380	119000	So I don't know, that's kind of cool.
119000	126000	The other thing which is going on right now that they were talking about was, I believe
126000	128000	Halo 2 for Vista.
128000	129240	Hold on, I have to say this.
129240	132960	Fire Bulma says, so you can stay in front of your television all day long.
132960	133960	Hooray.
133960	134960	Good point.
134960	138360	I mean, this is just encouraging people to get fat and lazy.
138360	145720	Okay, so with Windows Vista, you're going to be able to play people on the 360, playing
145720	151560	Halo 2 as well, and I assume, I guess, the original Xbox since, you know, they can play
151560	160160	against the 360 people, but that's not the only game that you can play anywhere, which
160160	163720	just was announced a few seconds ago here.
163720	169880	The one Live Anywhere game that's going to be able to be played on Vista, on the 360
169880	174240	and everything else, but not only that, Uno.
174240	175240	Uno Anywhere.
175240	177720	Oh my gosh, wow, interesting.
177720	181920	Really, you know, I always thought you could play Uno Anywhere anyways because it's cards,
181920	182920	but that's just me.
182920	186040	You can play the electronic version anywhere you go.
186040	189000	Draw 4, bitch, everywhere, across multiple platforms.
189000	192000	You know, I think this is interesting because it's not a big surprise, it doesn't seem like
192000	197200	anything that would be too difficult to do, I mean, cross-platform gaming is not unheard
197200	202280	of and even with 360, I mean, Final Fantasy XI, you play against PlayStation 2 and PC
202280	206000	users on Final Fantasy XI, right, which is on the 360, so it's not like this is unheard
206000	210160	of, it's just kind of, I don't think anybody thought that they would do this, I mean, it's
210160	214960	not really anything anyone was expecting, it's really truly a kind of pleasant surprise,
214960	215960	if you will.
215960	216960	Yeah.
216960	217960	Kind of interesting.
217960	220960	But once and for all, they will be able to settle the debate.
220960	225200	Is it easier to play with the keyboard and mouse or with the 360 controller?
225200	227920	They'll be able to finally settle that debate.
227920	229560	Great.
229560	230960	Very cool.
230960	236400	Yeah, the chat room seems to be agreeing over at chat.orangelaunusradio.com.
236400	240440	You know, you can play Uno with anyone anytime you want, just buy a deck of cards.
240440	242160	It's very easy.
242160	243160	But then...
243160	244160	I have an Uno deck.
244160	248960	But you can't get the Cameo cards and the Project Gotham racing cards, you can't...
248960	249960	So?
249960	256200	But I believe you can get, in regular, traditional card form, you can get Pokemon cards and the
256200	259320	Clear cards, so you can play Uno in the pool.
259320	263280	And you know, you can play World of Warcraft cards, too, once those come out.
263280	265440	Hooray, hooray.
265440	271720	Alright, well, I guess that's all we have coming out of CES right now.
271720	276720	There is one other thing, Sony seeing that they've hit their target amount of units shipped
276720	281640	for the Playstation 3, which was 1 million by the end of the year, although memory serves
281640	287160	me correctly, I believe that target was a lot higher, and then they lowered it down.
287160	291540	And the other thing, too, is they've shipped 1 million units worldwide.
291540	293040	Not sold, shipped.
293040	294200	They'll sell it.
294200	295560	They'll sell it.
295560	299920	I know we're all seeing the big pictures of stacks and stacks of PS3s on block.
299920	300920	They'll sell them.
300920	304360	Their next target is 6 million by March this year, so...
304360	305840	Now that's ambitious.
305840	307740	Let's see.
307740	311320	One thing I wanted to ask about, too, and you showed me this during the break while
311320	312420	we were alive.
312420	315960	You have this Impossible Mission ad, and I want...
315960	319280	It's Impossible Mission on the Wii, like the old school Commodore 64 game?
319280	320280	Yeah, yeah, it was one of the games.
320280	323680	I remember hearing Epyx was coming back and was going to redo games, but what the hell
323680	324680	is this?
324680	325680	I want it.
325680	326680	Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, Logie.
326680	330180	It's being released in the UK right now.
330180	333260	That's System 3 is putting it out.
333260	338720	And basically this is an ad sheet that they had on GoNintendo.com.
338720	347220	And yeah, it's just Impossible Mission, it's 2D, and yeah, just looks like kind of a visually
347220	349400	updated version of a possible mission.
349400	352040	So they're only getting it in Britain and not here?
352040	353040	So far.
353040	354320	I mean, it might end up coming over here.
354320	357000	Like the one game I want.
357000	360580	They do this to us.
360580	363800	Just say you folks over there don't get some love because there you go.
363800	365660	Maybe you should import a Wii.
365660	366660	I'm not going to import...
366660	367660	Well, I can't.
367660	369200	They're on the different TV standards over there.
369200	370200	Component?
370200	371200	I guess that's true.
371200	375880	I'm not going to import a Wii just to play Impossible Mission, I'm sorry.
375880	380160	I'll write Nastygrams to whatever company is System 3, I'll write Nastygrams to them
380160	381720	until they put this out in the US.
381720	383680	I'm sure it'll come out over here at some point.
383680	384680	It better.
384680	387600	At least it's a budget title if nothing else.
387600	395120	Alright, well, why don't we start off with the news, Loki, you had some news about E3?
395120	396120	Yes.
396120	400560	E3 and all 50,000 expos that have replaced it.
400560	404680	Well, the official one I guess, being done, well originally it was going to be the Game
404680	412300	Pro Expo, is now being called the Entertainment For All Expo, or the E For All Expo.
412300	415840	The E For All Expo sounds like a rave to me.
415840	417840	But, anyways...
417840	421040	E for everyone!
421040	423600	I love games, they're so pretty!
423600	426800	Can I have a hug?
426800	428560	The Entertainment For All Expo...
428560	429920	Jamie, cuddle!
429920	434580	Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub...
434580	435580	What?
435580	436580	No.
436580	441040	The Entertainment For All Expo as it suggests is open to the public if you have $100 because
441040	443920	it's going to cost you $100 to get into it.
443920	445720	Whoa, whoa, what?
445720	452960	gonna cost what? $100 to get into the expo. I guess that's not too bad. I mean if E3
452960	458060	wanted to charge you $100 to get in. Actually, from what I remember, any Schmoe could really
458060	462920	get into E3 for what that $400 fee or whatever it is. You really didn't even have to have
462920	468440	ties to the industry to get in that way. So, you know, this is I guess cheaper than that.
468440	471880	Because I imagine this expo will still be letting in, you know, media and all that type
471880	478080	of stuff for a different rate. Probably not the same $100. Maybe. Interesting. Interesting.
478080	484560	We'll see. But yeah, it'll be interesting to see how it ends up, you know, going down.
484560	489720	But it's gonna be this year, 18th through the 20th of October. And good point, we got
489720	494520	several people starting with Black Boy saying, except it isn't E3. And, you know, I understand.
494520	500300	But it's kind of, for all we know, all we got otherwise. So, and they say they're trying
500300	504360	to fill the void. So, I realize it's gonna be a little different because it's gonna be
504360	508440	targeted at the gamer as opposed to the industry. But it should be interesting nonetheless.
508440	512440	Well, I should be able to still go to the E3, the actual E3.
512440	516160	Well, yeah, that's true. Because it's not, you know, not going away. So, it'll be interesting
516160	517160	to see what happens.
517160	523200	Somebody's like, you know, don't fucking take me to E3, bitches. Mo, I need this. It's my
523200	525480	high. Anyways.
525480	528960	I need that E, man. I need to cuddle.
528960	531960	I need the EQ, man.
531960	535160	Speaking of PlayStation 3s, we were talking about a little bit earlier, the stacks and
535160	540800	stacks. Japan, over there, they're starting to see more PlayStation 3s. There was a report
540800	545580	that went into Kotaku.com earlier this week from a reader that said they went to the Bic
545580	551160	Camera store in Shibuya yesterday to pick up stuff for his place. And basically what
551160	557400	happens, there was some New Year's sales going on. And get this, is that when the guy walked
557400	563800	by, there were about 16 of the 60 gig and 12 of the 20 gig systems, priced for about
563800	569120	what translates to $520 and $430, respectively. You watch right past this big pallet full
569120	573560	of PlayStation 3s, just waiting to be sold over in Japan.
573560	576400	Very interesting. I mean, just a few months ago, we were talking about all that fear.
576400	581280	But you know, I know it's easy to want to like jump on Sony and be all like, haha, Sony's
581280	584440	not selling systems, blah, blah, blah. But you kind of have to think about, too, Christmas
584440	589680	is over, so I think more people are willing to wait. But I don't know. I guess then again,
589680	593720	the Wii is still seemingly selling out and the 360 at this time last year was still selling
593720	599600	out, too. But I don't know. I'd be very interested to see it on a graph, like how many systems
599600	604440	Microsoft had out there at this time last year and how many Sony has out there now.
604440	606960	You know what I mean? I mean, it's just because I'm a visual person, I want to see everything
606960	610280	on a graph. But I'd be very interested to see how it really compares. Because you could
610280	613840	say that the 360 was still sold out, but from what I remember, they weren't coming out very
613840	617160	often, whereas Sony seems to be doing a pretty consistent weekly shipment.
617160	620160	Well, according, this was the big thing that they were pushing. They were saying that we
620160	624560	outsold the 360 because we put out a million units before the end of the year and they
624560	631760	only had 600,000. So, yeah, but here's the thing, Microsoft's like, yeah, but bitches,
631760	638320	we were out a year before you, so we're ahead of you by a couple of million.
638320	642880	Okay, so Sony's saying they're on the track to outsell the 360 is what they're saying.
642880	647000	But Microsoft's saying, we lapped you, bitch.
647000	651240	They're just like saying, oh, we're meeting our numbers. Yeah, well, when you drop your
651240	657480	numbers like six times and then you're like, oh, yeah, we met our numbers fucking six months
657480	664360	late and we lowered them a bit, but we met them. God damn it, we met them. I mean, no,
664360	669080	you didn't technically meet them because, well, you only ship less than 400,000 units
669080	671880	that launch in the US, so whatever.
671880	674320	The CDR dollar bill says this is Sony math.
674320	675320	Exactly.
675320	685360	Remember, it's the math of those who eat crayons every day. Well, we have a little bit of something
685360	691320	flying around on the rumor mill. There is a rumor going around that Coded Arms Assault
691320	699640	has been canceled. The information states that Famitsu leaked it, but Konami hasn't
699640	706200	really confirmed anything yet. However, I do believe it's off release lists.
706200	711560	Interesting. I'm trying to think back to when we were at that last Konami event that they
711560	715200	had in, what, August, and I remember they were showing Coded Arms on the PSP, right,
715200	716200	Loki?
716200	717200	Yeah.
717200	718800	But they never showed us Coded Arms on PS3, but I remember some of the other journalists
718800	722840	were asking about it. They were really dodgy at the questions at the time, huh, if I remember
722840	725320	right. It's like they didn't want to say much about it.
725320	728200	Well, at E3, I think it was only a video.
728200	733520	Yeah. Well, this other press event we went to was after that, but they still were not
733520	734520	really saying much about it, huh?
734520	736080	Well, I guess we'll find out in a few weeks.
736080	739400	Yeah, this is interesting. Ah, yes, it's true. I guess Konami has another event coming up,
739400	741160	so we'll see for sure then.
741160	745440	Personally, from the distribution point, we've only seen dates for the PSP version. I haven't
745440	750040	seen anything for the PS3. Although, I went down to the PS3 one, probably coming out towards
750040	751040	Christmas anyways.
751040	755880	Do you think it's because Coded Arms just hasn't been a very well-received series?
755880	765120	I want to say I heard that the game was really buggy and crappy from the beta or whatever
765120	770720	state it's in right now, alpha or whatever, that it hasn't been very good. I think right
770720	775500	now, if anything, I don't know if it's canceled, but it may be put on hold or maybe just way
775500	781240	behind in development schedule. I don't know. It's not coming out any time soon either way.
781240	785360	Mystic Gohan says, Well, Coded Arms sucks, so I'm not getting my hopes up yet. Legend
785360	789300	of Zaku says, The only thing that can save PlayStation 3 is Metal Gear Solid 4. Mike
789300	791800	W. also agrees, Coded Arms sucked ass.
791800	794440	I don't really think you need to save the PlayStation 3. The only thing that can save
794440	798400	the PlayStation 3 is put more games out. That's about it. And put more games out that haven't
798400	802880	been out for six months on the 360. I mean, that's what they need to do. I mean, why the
802880	807700	fuck are, seriously, games that are supposed to be launch titles like Rainbow Six Vegas
807700	811920	or something like that and they haven't even put it out yet. I mean, come on. That's the
811920	812920	problem.
812920	824240	Anyways, so, as we were, you know, probably talking about here, Metal Gear Solid and how
824240	828160	Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3. Well, Metal Gear Solid Portable
828160	832720	Ops just came out on the PSP. Not a huge surprise that they're talking about getting a sequel
832720	837940	done already. And, you know, since the game sold pretty well, I mean, maybe not as well
837940	843320	as they would hope, you know, not exactly a system seller, but it's doing very well
843320	847120	and definitely going to be, you know, a sequel that's going to be coming, so.
847120	854120	Wait, so you mean a game as popular and well received as Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops
854120	858680	for, you know, being one of the greatest games on the PSP, according to most people, it's
858680	859680	getting a sequel?
859680	860680	I know, that's a shock.
860680	861680	A shock of the century.
861680	864840	And the sequel will be called Metal Gear Acid 3.
864840	870000	Oh, I hope not. But maybe it'll come with cool 3D glasses. That was actually...
870000	874560	Metal Gear Acid is like what happens when you program a game on acid.
874560	877680	You know what, though? The 3D thing I actually thought was kind of cute. I have to admit,
877680	881840	that little, you know, the little paper glasses or whatever they're playing Acid 2 on, it's
881840	882840	actually kind of cute.
882840	883840	Well, it's cute watching Dan play it.
883840	888560	You know what the best part about the 3D glasses were? The videos of the hot Asian chicks wearing
888560	897600	the camo bikinis that you would unlock from playing the game. In 3D. Anyway, I thought
897600	899160	you got laid on a regular basis.
899160	903920	Do not even talk about Asian girls in bikinis and things because...
903920	906880	Yeah, how's Dead or Alive Xtreme going?
906880	913300	I'm actually referring to a video that one of our listeners, I don't know if he wants
913300	920600	to tell me, but he just laughed at it. I got sent a Para Para videos with really ugly,
920600	932800	way too skinny Japanese girls in ganguro makeup. So, you can't say those words together without
932800	934800	me freaking out a little bit.
934800	940320	We had some weirder stuff with the Asian girls on the Wednesday show.
940320	944740	I'm not even going there. Let's move on to one other way that listeners can interact
944740	952840	with us and give their feedback is our voicemail. Our 800 number, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR. It's
952840	958000	1-877-GAME-OLR. We got some voicemails this week, thanks to those of you guys that left
958000	962280	the voicemails. That number is toll free in the US and Canada, but I want to point out
962280	966820	it's not toll free outside of that, which makes this first voicemail all the more special.
966820	971160	This actually came in on the Skype part of that, because if you are in the UK or Australia,
971160	974840	New Zealand, wherever the heck you are in the world, you can use the Skype to leave
974840	978300	us a message for free. You can just call Orange Lounge Radio when we're not live and leave
978300	981880	us a voicemail. That's what this first voicemail is from. Let's take a listen.
981880	988720	Hey, guys. This is Shoshia from the UK. I was just wondering, you mentioned every Xtend
988720	994640	Xtra on the show a couple of times, so I looked it up. It's not coming out in the UK until
994640	1000080	the middle of February, and I was wondering if you'd be importing it off eBay, and also,
1000080	1006720	is DDR Supernova worth the wait, because it's coming out in February as well, I think. Anyway,
1006720	1011160	guys, keep up the good work. I love listening to the show, especially when I'm on the bus,
1011160	1016080	because bus rides are so boring, and I do get funny looks when I start laughing at all
1016080	1020160	the weird stuff you come out with. Anyway, guys, see you.
1020160	1026680	Thank you for the voicemail. That was pretty awesome. Let's see. As far as every Xtend
1026680	1034400	Xtra goes, you can actually play for free on the internet. You can download every Xtend,
1034400	1038420	which is the game that it's based off of. In fact, I want to say Dark Tetsuya posted
1038420	1043160	this in one of our forums. In the PC gaming forum we have, he actually posted a link to
1043160	1047040	a bunch of free games you can download, and every Xtend was one of them. If you're not
1047040	1050760	sure if you'd like the game or not, check that out. You can actually play that on the
1050760	1057960	PC, and then just imagine the Mizuguchi touch to that, the hyper colors and the themes and
1057960	1062920	the looks to it. The demo that comes with Luminous 2 gives you a little bit of a good
1062920	1066720	feel for what the game's about, but it doesn't quite show you how the skin changes and things
1066720	1070720	affect the game. You have to remember that the entire look of the game really changes
1070720	1076240	in between stages. The game's pretty fun. It's no Luminous. I don't hold it up to that
1076240	1081320	same high caliber, and it's a little more action than it is puzzle. It's more of a fast
1081320	1084920	paced puzzle game. There's definitely a lot of action element involved, but it's pretty
1084920	1089240	cool. As far as DDR Supernova, it's kind of hard to tell because the game varies from
1089240	1093400	region to region because of licenses, but here in America I did think Supernova was
1093400	1099000	probably about on the same level with DDR Extreme 2, if not a little bit better. I'd
1099000	1102760	say it's worth your time if you're a DDR fan, or if you've never played the series before,
1102760	1107560	it's certainly a good enabler. From what I remember, the UK, in my opinion anyway, typically
1107560	1111920	gets better licenses anyway than we do, so I'm sure it's going to be even more worth
1111920	1124920	your while. I'd have to say that the last Stepping Stage had a really, really good track
1124920	1129400	list. I'd hope that some of those would be incorporated into some of our releases, but
1129400	1135360	unfortunately no. Well yeah, it's always a licensing issue, and the music that sells
1135360	1138800	over there isn't the same that sells over here all the time. Some of the hits are the
1138800	1143880	same, but for instance, take an artist like Robbie Williams over there, freaking huge,
1143880	1149180	popular, but over here he's really struggling. They've tried so many times to make him popular
1149180	1153320	here and he just hasn't really caught on. I personally wanted the Ash song in there
1153320	1158680	because I really like that band. Let's go to our second one. By the way, thank you very
1158680	1161720	much for the voicemail, we appreciate it. And the compliments they left, we cracked
1161720	1166960	them up on the bus or the subway, one of the two. Oh, the bus. So thank you, that's very
1166960	1170560	nice, appreciate it. Remember, the biggest way we can help spread the word about Orange
1170560	1174160	Laundry Radio is word of mouth, so you laughing on the bus and someone asking you what are
1174160	1178920	you listening to is like, seriously, that's a compliment to us. Let's go to our next voicemail.
1178920	1184320	Hi, this is Razorburn 2021. You will never see me in the chat room, you'll probably never
1184320	1191240	see me around. I happen to be an offline listener. I listen via my PSP and Bleaching Connections.
1191240	1197080	I just wanted to thank you for a very nice year of episodes. I listen to them at work
1197080	1202860	and they really provide me with the news, albeit it's generally kind of a week late
1202860	1207680	of stuff, but it's a way I'm able to keep up on what's going on in the gaming world.
1207680	1211120	I've kind of jumped back and forth between a lot of podcasts. You're one of the first
1211120	1216680	ones I picked up and I've stuck with you. I'm just really happy with your show and I
1216680	1222360	wanted to wish you a happy new year and say thank you and please provide me with one in
1222360	1223360	the future.
1223360	1227440	Aw, thanks for the warm fuzzies. We appreciate that. We like the little compliments to keep
1227440	1231960	us going. That was very nice. All things to say, there's a purposeful reason why I play
1231960	1237920	this one because he said that he listened to the show on the PSP. I think last week
1237920	1242240	on the New Year's Eve special I was a little bit harsh on the PSP, so I wish to clarify
1242240	1249960	my statements on the PSP just to say I do really like the PSP as a multimedia device.
1249960	1256080	It is an incredible multimedia device. I mean it plays videos, MP3s, and games and all the
1256080	1260840	movie stuff on top of that. The problem is as a gaming device solely, I don't think it's
1260840	1264200	up to par with the DS and that's my own personal opinion. I don't think the library of games
1264200	1268560	that the PSP is offering is quite up to par with the DS, but I think the fact that people
1268560	1274480	do listen to the show on the PSP kind of speaks to why the PSP is a pretty good system because
1274480	1278440	of the fact, hey, not only can you listen to these RSS feeds on the go over the internet,
1278440	1284800	but you can play Luminous too. I mean that's what's great about the PSP and why if you
1284800	1290560	don't own one you should think about it. I mean they really are pretty decent systems.
1290560	1295680	If you're only looking for gaming and maybe you already have an iPod, you already have
1295680	1301040	a laptop to get your podcast on the go or whatever, maybe you don't need it. But if
1301040	1304040	you don't have any of that stuff I think the PSP is a pretty good buy to get a lot of that
1304040	1305040	crap on the go.
1305040	1309160	If you haven't bought one yet you might want to just hold off anyways because what the
1309160	1315080	rumor mill has been saying is that they're going to redesign it anyways, so better to
1315080	1319800	wait and not get caught in one of those DS DS Lite Fiasco's.
1319800	1324200	Rama in our chat room says, Rob, if you want a multimedia device get a computer. Well,
1324200	1327160	silly, I'm talking about portable devices obviously.
1327160	1328160	Laptop.
1328160	1331440	Well, but laptops are thousands of dollars for a good one.
1331440	1335280	And they're not that portable, but you've got to whip this thing out, it's not that
1335280	1336280	portable.
1336280	1337280	Yeah, the little ones, sidekick.
1337280	1342560	Okay, but PSP goes near, but sidekick. A PSP is better than a sidekick, I think, except
1342560	1346880	for the fact you can't make calls with a PSP. I already have a phone. I think the PSP is
1346880	1350300	a pretty cool little pocket system.
1350300	1351600	How big are your pockets?
1351600	1355640	Big. I can fit PSP in my pocket no problem.
1355640	1358440	My DS fits in my purse. That little micro thing.
1358440	1360560	Your PSP could probably fit in your purse, too.
1360560	1361560	No, it wouldn't.
1361560	1362560	Really?
1362560	1363560	No, I can barely get...
1363560	1364560	You have too much in your purse.
1364560	1367560	I have no idea what happened to my sonic screwdriver. It fell out of my purse.
1367560	1368560	That sucks.
1368560	1370560	It doesn't even that fit.
1370560	1376120	Alright, and there was another comment in here somewhere I wanted to read. Well, I guess
1376120	1381200	that was it. I can't find the other one, so there you have it. Chat.orangewansradio.com
1381200	1385160	if you're listening live on this Sunday night and you want to join or entertain your thoughts.
1385160	1387840	And of course, the chat room is open all week long and it gets kind of dead when there's
1387840	1388840	no live programming.
1388840	1389840	I have to agree with Ron Law on this.
1389840	1390840	What do I want to say?
1390840	1394440	A laptop may be thousands of dollars, but it is more useful than a damn PSP.
1394440	1399680	But if you're, okay, but you know, if you're a 14-year-old kid, you may not have a need
1399680	1400680	for a laptop.
1400680	1403160	They make very small laptops, too. There's new Vios.
1403160	1406960	I just think, you know, yes, a laptop you get a lot of value of, but you have to ask
1406960	1408720	yourself, do you really need all that stuff?
1408720	1413720	I mean, how easy is it to turn on your PSP, click, have the headphones in, and listen
1413720	1417960	to the show as opposed to, ah, I better whip out the laptop, fire up iTunes, da-da-da.
1417960	1421240	I mean, don't get me wrong. A laptop serves a very useful purpose.
1421240	1426640	I heart my little Mac laptop and it's one of the best purchases I made last year.
1426640	1430840	But, you know, I still also like my PSP for those types of things.
1430840	1432840	I need a bigger memory card, though.
1432840	1435080	All right.
1435080	1439440	You can also interact with us by sending us e-mails to mailbag at orangeontraday.com,
1439440	1441760	and we will get to the mailbag a little bit later in the show.
1441760	1445800	But first, more news, and we'll start off with this story.
1445800	1451600	Coming from Korea, game censorship, a hot topic worldwide, not just Korea, but worldwide.
1451600	1456180	Of course, you know, in 2006, we had Rule of Rose causing the problems in Europe and
1456180	1461200	Tak Jomsom getting his head into everything over here, which would just go away.
1461200	1462200	Other than a pizazz?
1462200	1463200	Yes.
1463200	1469160	In South Korea, things are actually going kind of maybe a little more in favor of games.
1469160	1474040	Now, games that have previously depicted military and political actions against North Korea
1474040	1478000	have been banned because they were a little bit too touchy with, you know, the political
1478000	1479880	situations going on in the world.
1479880	1484980	So they said that Tom Clancy goes to Recon 2 and Splinter Cell Chaos Theories and Mercenaries.
1484980	1485980	No go.
1485980	1486980	They're banned.
1486980	1487980	Banned games.
1487980	1490480	But what just recently happened, the game reading board of Korea actually said that
1490480	1495200	they are going to lift the ban, and in 2007, these games will become available.
1495200	1500600	And the head of the rating board, Kim Ki-Man, said in the Korea Times, quote, the reasoning
1500600	1505640	behind the decision was said to be to allow freedom of expression.
1505640	1508240	So there you go.
1508240	1512320	So that's pretty cool, I think, that, you know, I don't think any of us particularly
1512320	1513560	enjoy censorship.
1513560	1517940	We sometimes take for granted the free world we live in here in this particular country.
1517940	1521160	So I think it's very nice that, you know, other folks are getting to experience some
1521160	1523160	of the same art forms we do here.
1523160	1525120	I don't think anyone takes that stuff too seriously.
1525120	1529440	You know, I don't, you know, go, oh my gosh, because I'm fighting against the North Koreans
1529440	1532400	in this game, I have to do that in real life, too.
1532400	1533940	I don't think anyone's that stupid.
1533940	1534940	I would hope.
1534940	1535940	I would really, really hope.
1535940	1542360	Well, I'm all for expression, and it looks like there's another way to express yourself.
1542360	1548440	And that's by turning your Wii into a vibrator, your Wiimote into a vibrator.
1548440	1553480	Hey, it was, it can be done with the Rez trans vibrator.
1553480	1559120	We can have the Hello Kitty and I found a Doraemon vibrator on eBay.
1559120	1560240	Okay.
1560240	1564480	Not that I want to be entertaining this notion, but doesn't the Wii kind of already vibrate?
1564480	1567440	Like I know whenever I'm using that stupid keyboard thing on the Wii, it's like that
1567440	1571160	thing keeps constantly shaking in my hand as I move around the keyboard.
1571160	1573400	So what are we talking about here?
1573400	1587080	There is one that, it's a program that's put out by Kako, shut up, K-A-K-O.
1587080	1593440	You download it to your PC, hook it up through your Bluetooth, and it vibrates on command,
1593440	1594440	I guess.
1594440	1596880	You know, I want to say, though, there was an easier way to do this.
1596880	1602480	Someone was posting before there was some sort of flaw in the Opera browser with a,
1602480	1608280	I guess it was a URL that's too long or something, the tag, will cause your browser to crash
1608280	1612440	and I think it causes the remote to vibrate as well and I think that might be an easier
1612440	1613440	way to do that.
1613440	1614440	Okay.
1614440	1615720	So something easier than using your Kako?
1615720	1616720	Yes.
1616720	1617720	Okay.
1617720	1618720	I'm looking at the guy's site, actually.
1618720	1624080	There's a Wii Remote Test, Wii Sabre.
1624080	1627480	There's um, okay, I can't read this.
1627480	1638240	Wii Braider Test, Wii Mice Test, Wii Fall Detect Test, Wii Remote IR Sensor Test, Wii
1638240	1646760	Pointer Test, Wii Nunchaku Test, a bunch of stuff.
1646760	1647760	This is crazy.
1647760	1657880	I'm linking this, though, in the chatroom so that they, too, can enjoy the Wii Braider.
1657880	1659800	The joys of the Wii.
1659800	1667760	Well, a couple websites out there want you to enjoy the Wii as well, especially when
1667760	1668760	it comes to porn.
1668760	1676120	Yes, a few websites out there are making their porno Wii friendly.
1676120	1677120	Wait, this reminds me.
1677120	1679840	Jamie, did I tell you about what we did on New Year's Eve?
1679840	1680840	Orgy?
1680840	1681840	No.
1681840	1682840	We had about 12 people over here.
1682840	1683840	You called me drunk!
1683840	1689480	No, we had about 12 people over here and we had this, you know, somebody that we know
1689480	1691940	had said they'd never seen a porno before.
1691940	1697440	So we decided to use the internet browsing capabilities of the Wii to surf to pornotube.com
1697440	1704740	and bring it up on the Wii and actually, and by the way, if you're under 18, don't do this.
1704740	1709600	But yeah, we looked up, let me just say the first thing we clicked on, because we couldn't
1709600	1713760	resist, said pterodactyl porn.
1713760	1719180	Yeah, it really is what it sounds like.
1719180	1720180	It's something to behold.
1720180	1722180	I'll give it that.
1722180	1725000	Again, don't go to that website if you're under 18, kids.
1725000	1729520	Sorry, Loki, I had to share that because you did use the Wii for pornographic purposes
1729520	1730520	already.
1730520	1734200	Oh yeah, we've been on it a few times.
1734200	1740640	So, yeah, it was apparently one of the free adult sites out there and if you're curious
1740640	1747040	on wondering what site, I'm not really going to give them free advertising, but it's listed
1747040	1748040	on rstecnica.com.
1748040	1752040	If you go to the free site, apparently...
1752040	1754880	So you're giving free advertising by proxy?
1754880	1756880	Yes.
1756880	1757880	You make no sense.
1757880	1759860	It's a free porn site out there.
1759860	1763560	One I have never heard of, by the way.
1763560	1765800	Porn doesn't look that good, by the way.
1765800	1770120	Anyway, so it's free and apparently it's Wii friendly.
1770120	1772920	So it's kind of neat that they're...
1772920	1777240	And usually, it's kind of funny, porn studios are usually ahead of the game for the most
1777240	1778240	part with technology.
1778240	1784840	I know porn studios were the first ones that actually have, I think, DVDs and recordable
1784840	1790820	VHS stuff as well, and now that they're kind of making content for the PSP and the Wii
1790820	1796760	and God knows what other browsers out there, so not a huge surprise.
1796760	1798680	That's kind of cool, though.
1798680	1802840	Just think of all the porn sites that are going to use that play on the Wii name.
1802840	1807600	Just think of all the Fox News stories we're going to see about how the Wii is a gateway
1807600	1814680	to porno for your children, wah, evil.
1814680	1817500	Sometimes I wish this next guy would just go away.
1817500	1821920	This story about Uwe Boll, who, you know, he's that famed director who brought us such
1821920	1824360	cinema classics as BloodRayne.
1824360	1826520	Whatever happened to the fucking Dungeon Siege movie?
1826520	1827520	Did that actually come out?
1827520	1828520	Wasn't that supposed to come out in 2006?
1828520	1829520	It hasn't come out yet.
1829520	1832520	It was supposed to come out in 2006 and it got delayed until, I think, March.
1832520	1834360	It got delayed for all eternity.
1834360	1839160	Well, Uwe Boll is making a movie out of Far Cry right now, and I have this interesting
1839160	1840160	quote to say.
1840160	1844100	Quote, every other game I did so far, the game makers were happy I did a movie to support
1844100	1845280	their franchise.
1845280	1852660	With Far Cry, Ubisoft wants me to make a good movie because this is already a big franchise
1852660	1854480	for them and they want to keep it going.
1854480	1858400	I think they will be more involved in the whole process than the other companies before.
1858400	1863320	We always want to make a good movie.
1863320	1867800	In the past, the game companies never co-promoted the movie or even had a new game come out
1867800	1869320	with a movie.
1869320	1873600	Uwe, those guys could have promoted the movies all they wanted to.
1873600	1877920	They could have had the money pouring out their butts, but if the movie sucked, that's
1877920	1880160	not going to suddenly make the movie better.
1880160	1884680	There's probably a reason they didn't promote the movie because when they saw it, they probably
1884680	1889080	said, why did we ever sign over the rights to this god-awful man?
1889080	1895600	They even included free copies of the PC version of Blood Rain and it's still in that cell,
1895600	1896600	Blood Rain, the DVD.
1896600	1900400	Well, actually, I guess Blood Rain DVD sold okay, but that's because no one saw it in
1900400	1901400	the theaters.
1901400	1902920	Because everyone heard that one chick was naked.
1902920	1907400	I bet you that's why they sold two million copies.
1907400	1914600	Do like the rest of us and just see it on a website for free.
1914600	1917920	It's kind of funny they mention Far Cry and stuff because I really hope they don't kill
1917920	1918920	that franchise.
1918920	1922000	They can go ahead and kill all these other ones that have been dead for a long time,
1922000	1927120	but just stay away from the good franchises.
1927120	1931840	Whenever Uwe Boll manages to make its way into our show script for what stories we're
1931840	1934320	going to read, I feel a little dead inside.
1934320	1938640	That makes me very angsty, so I think it's an appropriate time for us to bring on the
1938640	1946640	FUs of the week, don't you think?
1946640	1950320	Yes.
1950320	1962720	FU goes towards money, damn money, damn having to pay for everything.
1962720	1969680	I am an advocate of working hard for the things I just want, but damn the fact that I have
1969680	1976040	to shell out $415 tomorrow to pay for my first deposit for school and my books.
1976040	1981120	And then I have to do another $285, and another $285, and another $285 until I'm done.
1981120	1988320	Which I'll be done at the end of March, and a $1400 gamble to make an extra $17000 a year
1988320	1996400	working less hours is awfully nice, but at the same time, that's a lot of money right
1996400	1997400	now.
1997400	2002680	I got to see rent, so yeah, fuck money.
2002680	2007680	Black Boy says boo-hoo, Dark Sakura has to pay for school.
2007680	2014800	I've been in college now, off and on, over the past 10-11 years or so, and I finally
2014800	2021600	found something that I really, really want to do.
2021600	2029400	And I think that it'll pay off, but for right now, I'm entitled to sit back and look at
2029400	2032760	this and say, how the hell am I going to steam this?
2032760	2037400	So I think I'm going to make it work, it'll be worth it, but at the same time.
2037400	2039600	Now you just got called a career student.
2039600	2045280	I am, you know what, my theory is to never stop learning, honestly.
2045280	2050120	The moment that you stop learning and let yourself fall into stagnant ignorance is the
2050120	2051840	day you should shoot yourself in the head.
2051840	2055800	Well it's a good thing we fill your head full of news every week on this program so you
2055800	2057240	can consistently learn something new.
2057240	2059440	I am proud to be a career student.
2059440	2064160	No matter how long I work, no matter what I do, I'm still going to be learning something.
2064160	2068000	I'm a teacher kind of, so do I get props?
2068000	2069000	No.
2069000	2070000	Go to school.
2070000	2071240	Low key.
2071240	2076560	One lesson I hope that was learned today was the kids out front of your apartment complex,
2076560	2081920	thank you to them for being dumb enough to leave their remote controlled car parked in
2081920	2083920	an empty space.
2083920	2088640	So when I pulled my car in there, I crushed the car and the kid cried, and he was just
2088640	2089640	like, my car!
2089640	2090640	It's crushed!
2090640	2093600	Well, you're a dumbass and you left it in the space.
2093600	2095720	I feel no remorse for you.
2095720	2101240	That'll teach you to put away your damn toys and stop playing in the goddamn street.
2101240	2104120	If I went to stripping school, would that count?
2104120	2105120	Yes.
2105120	2106120	Cool.
2106120	2107120	You'd be learning a skill.
2107120	2108560	A necessary job function.
2108560	2111200	They could eventually make you like a dollar.
2111200	2115160	I would probably make more money doing that than I do what I do now.
2115160	2121360	I got to lose my little pooch here, but maybe I should look into it.
2121360	2124680	I just don't want to have to grow my hair out to look like thunder down under.
2124680	2132240	Why is this on our program?
2132240	2137120	I want to say an F you to these kettle chips that are Tuscan three cheese flavor because
2137120	2142680	I've almost eaten the whole freaking bag sitting right here and that's not healthy.
2142680	2146520	I love how I'm talking about exercising and working out and then I'm like, I just ate
2146520	2152240	a whole bag of potato chips and I wonder why I'm fat.
2152240	2153240	They're like really good chips though.
2153240	2156560	An F you to having no self control.
2156560	2157560	Kill me now.
2157560	2158560	Okay.
2158560	2159560	Thanks.
2159560	2160560	They're really good chips though.
2160560	2161560	They're like the best chips in the world.
2161560	2162560	Kill me now.
2162560	2163560	I want to die.
2163560	2164560	Can I?
2164560	2165560	No.
2165560	2166560	Oh, okay.
2166560	2168220	You can die soon and it will make you not want to die.
2168220	2169680	Guess what?
2169680	2170680	What?
2170680	2175380	Silent Hill 2 yeah, I am so happy there's going to be a Silent Hill 2 Marketplace.
2175380	2181200	Christophe Gans said he's working on the second Silent Hill movie script which is being written
2181200	2186600	by Rodger Avery.
2186600	2190960	They were actually saying that it was going to be written by Neil Gaiman, but he's actually
2190960	2196000	said on his blog that he actually doesn't really have any involvement in it.
2196000	2201200	From what I understand, I think he might be a consultant, but I don't think he's actually involved much in the actual thing.
2201200	2204000	But hey, at Sutton Hill, happy.
2205300	2207800	You probably like the movie more than anyone else I know, so...
2207800	2209100	I've seen it four times in the theater.
2209100	2209900	Oh my god.
2210400	2212200	And I'm going to be buying the Blu-ray Disc soon.
2212300	2212800	Yeah?
2213100	2214800	So I can turn off all the lights and go,
2214800	2215600	Ooh.
2215900	2216600	Ooh.
2216600	2218000	Worship Pyramid Head, build a shrine of fire.
2218000	2218900	No!
2219300	2223000	I don't know why everyone thinks that I'm this big Red Pyramid fangirl.
2223300	2224100	Because you are.
2224100	2225600	No.
2226600	2231100	I love the entire story, the entire feel of the game.
2231100	2233600	I love the whole mythology behind it.
2233600	2236600	But Pyramid Head, Red Pyramid, whatever, symbolizes all of that in one...
2236600	2237600	No, it does not.
2237600	2238600	Fancy little hot body.
2238600	2242100	Red Pyramid is the guy in the second game's repressed sexuality.
2242100	2244600	Because he goes around raping all the female monsters...
2244600	2246100	OMG, spoilers!
2246100	2247100	Oh, come on.
2247600	2250100	The game's been out for, what, five years?
2250600	2252100	I think people should know by now.
2252600	2253600	Guess what?
2253600	2254100	What?
2254600	2256600	Red Pyramid kills Dumbledore.
2258100	2259100	You're done.
2259100	2261600	Speaking of jokes that are years old, thank you for that.
2264600	2269100	Anyways, so something that doesn't have to do with rape or Silent Hill.
2269600	2271100	Nintendo was...
2271100	2272600	All of them, forget it. I don't want to hear it.
2273100	2274100	Moving on.
2274600	2275100	Just kidding.
2275600	2278600	Nintendo has partnered up with MMO producer Nexon.
2278600	2283600	And really there's no news other than just that.
2283600	2286600	They don't really know why they partner up.
2286600	2292100	But it seems to be that the general consensus is they're working on new MapleStory.
2292100	2295100	MapleStory DS or possibly MapleStory Wii.
2296100	2297600	So that should be interesting.
2297600	2299600	I'm always for more games.
2299600	2303100	And especially if it's going to be an MMO, that would be pretty cool too.
2303600	2307100	Why am I not surprised that if Nintendo was going to partner up with any MMO maker,
2307100	2309100	it would be the folks that made MapleStory?
2310100	2311100	It's very interesting.
2311100	2314100	What do you think we might have in store for us on the Wii?
2314100	2315100	I've just never...
2315100	2317600	I've never thought of an MMO on a Nintendo system.
2317600	2319100	I mean, it's never really happened before,
2319100	2322100	with the exception of Phantasy Star Online on the GameCube.
2322100	2325100	But let's face it, Nintendo really didn't support that the way they should have.
2325100	2331100	So that fluke aside, there's not really been MMOs on Nintendo systems that I can think of.
2331100	2332600	So this is very interesting to me.
2333100	2334100	Yeah, I don't know.
2334100	2335100	I don't know, it's...
2336100	2339100	I was surprised that they weren't actually partnering up.
2339100	2341100	What was that one wiki?
2342100	2346100	Because that kind of looked very similar to Wind Waker.
2346100	2350100	So that would be kind of funny if they took that over and made a game based on that.
2350100	2354100	But MapleStory, based on the graphics of the game and stuff,
2354100	2358100	I think that it would fit on Nintendo console pretty well.
2358100	2360100	I would like to see it as a Wii game,
2360100	2367100	because I think it might need a little bit more processor power to actually put out the graphics and stuff.
2367100	2370100	Plus, I don't know how well a DS MMO would work.
2370100	2371100	Especially if you've got to pay for it.
2371100	2372100	No, you don't know unless you try.
2372100	2373100	True.
2373100	2375100	You know, who knows what they could come out with.
2375100	2379100	I would think a game like Ragnarok might actually work really well on the DS.
2379100	2380100	Sad but true.
2381100	2382100	Be very interesting.
2383100	2387100	Anyhow, one thing we resolved to do in the year 2007 is that
2387100	2390100	we're not showing PC gaming enough love on this program
2390100	2392100	and some folks have brought that to our attention.
2392100	2397100	So we would like to spend a little bit of time here on the show to go over some PC gaming related stories.
2397100	2400100	And, okay, I guess I'm cheating a little bit with this first one,
2400100	2404100	because this kind of is both PC and Xbox 360.
2404100	2407100	But a lot of you guys are playing Oblivion on the PC.
2407100	2413100	And this actually was recently announced by PC Gamer and PC Zone magazines.
2413100	2417100	There's a new Oblivion expansion on the way called the Shivering Isles.
2417100	2420100	And it only has been confirmed, well, through this for the PC so far.
2420100	2422100	We don't know if this is going to come out on 360 yet.
2422100	2423100	Yeah, I think it is.
2423100	2426100	I imagine it would. I mean Oblivion does very well on the 360.
2426100	2430100	But, anyhow, for now we know it's probably going to make its way to the PC.
2430100	2437100	It will let players explore the Isles, which are divided into northern and southern areas titled Mania and Dementia.
2437100	2439100	Boy, this sounds like a fun place to go.
2439100	2443100	Then you'll be able to go to a door on this...
2443100	2449100	The way you get there is you get to go through this door near Breville that takes you to this area.
2449100	2457100	And supposedly it's going to extend Oblivion's gameplay for 30 more hours with new creatures, quests, and dungeons.
2457100	2463100	One of the new quests, you'll be solving a mystery in a town on the border of Mania and Dementia.
2463100	2466100	Every citizen has a look-alike in the town.
2466100	2472100	Some of the new monsters in the game, the Gatekeeper, a collection of body parts that have been stitched together.
2472100	2473100	Awesome.
2473100	2475100	And the Knights of the Order, which are made up of three roots.
2475100	2476100	Oh, you're the Gatekeeper.
2476100	2478100	I'm surprised you're not playing more Oblivion.
2478100	2480100	You know, because you can set fire to anything in that game, Jamie.
2480100	2482100	You can play more Oblivion?
2482100	2485100	No, I mean, I know you haven't even played it really at all.
2485100	2488100	I'm surprised by that because I would think you'd enjoy it.
2488100	2489100	But maybe it's just me.
2489100	2492100	Well, I'm not going to have any time over the next three months, that's for sure.
2492100	2493100	I guess, yeah.
2493100	2494100	Bye-bye life!
2494100	2500100	As if your life hadn't been sucked away enough into Oblivion as it is if you've been playing this game.
2500100	2504100	Now they're just going to have this, which is even more hours gone away.
2504100	2506100	It's amazing the types of things that people made for Oblivion.
2506100	2511100	There's an Oblivion wiki out there, a Google Map-style thing for Oblivion.
2511100	2512100	It's crazy.
2512100	2514100	Excuse me, it's crazy.
2514100	2515100	Bless you.
2515100	2516100	Sorry.
2516100	2517100	Live radio.
2517100	2518100	Yep.
2518100	2519100	We sneeze.
2519100	2521100	Well, I have some news.
2521100	2522100	PC-related?
2522100	2528100	Actually, yep.
2528100	2536100	Sony Online Entertainment is releasing, they actually have the open beta for Vanguard Saga of Heroes.
2536100	2541100	It was available on the 5th.
2541100	2550100	And they also have a pre-order campaign that's given to anyone who is given access to the open beta.
2550100	2559100	Some of the websites have had a lot of coverage on this Vanguard game, and it looks like it could be pretty interesting if you're into those types of PC MMOs.
2559100	2563100	So, I might check it out if I have some time, if I can pull myself away from Oblivion.
2563100	2564100	That's kind of pretty.
2564100	2565100	Yeah.
2565100	2570100	Well, one game I'm looking forward to, especially even on the PC, and I know they're making a 360 version, which is awesome,
2570100	2577100	but Command & Conquer 3, Tiberian Wars, they're going to get a special edition called the Kane Edition,
2577100	2584100	and for those who may not have played Command & Conquer, Kane is the villain who actually, kind of funny enough,
2584100	2590100	because he heads up the nod, looks like Zod from the Superman movies.
2590100	2593100	So, I don't know, every time I see him I think it's Zod, but whatever.
2593100	2598100	Anyway, so the special edition, what you're going to get for $59.99,
2598100	2606100	you're going to get a behind-the-scenes documentary and exclusive in-game content, which is kind of cool.
2606100	2615100	As well as strategy guides, deleted scenes, and bloopers from the game's live-action sequences.
2615100	2622100	And, of course, some of the exclusive content, you'll get exclusive multiplayer maps, three exclusive unit skins,
2622100	2625100	and a limited-edition poster.
2625100	2629100	So, that'd be pretty cool.
2629100	2632100	Going back to something I said earlier, because I'm reading the comments in the chat room right now,
2632100	2637100	Shadowsliar says, Sky, how is that crazy? Many games have their own wiki.
2637100	2640100	In reference to what I was saying, Oblivion has all that crazy stuff out there.
2640100	2641100	I guess that's true.
2641100	2644100	I mean, there are a lot of fan communities.
2644100	2648100	With wiki being open source and everything, many fan communities throw up their own wiki.
2648100	2652100	But I guess I felt like the Oblivion one just felt so vast.
2652100	2654100	You know, there's so much in that freaking game.
2654100	2660100	There's not a lot of games I can recall playing that have the amazing depth that Oblivion has.
2660100	2666100	So, I don't know, I guess the wiki seems so vast as the game does. Does that make sense?
2666100	2670100	You visit some wikis for some games and there's not a lot to it.
2670100	2673100	You know, it's more like a pretty FAQ. Does that make sense?
2673100	2679100	Yeah. Plus the PC version, you can get them all run around topless.
2679100	2682100	Well, you do the mods and everything on the PC one, too.
2682100	2684100	I really should be playing Oblivion on the PC, not the 360.
2684100	2687100	But I'm such an achievement point, so I can't help myself.
2687100	2690100	I really do want to get the Oblivion now for the PC.
2690100	2691100	You should!
2691100	2692100	I think it would be fun on my laptop.
2692100	2693100	It might be.
2693100	2696100	I could put the mods in. That's what I'm all about, is mods.
2696100	2698100	Well, PC gamers, don't say we don't love you.
2698100	2704100	Another thing maybe we need to resolve to do is give a little love to mobile gaming,
2704100	2706100	although I'm not the biggest fan of mobile gaming.
2706100	2712100	I've started to come around a little bit in 2006 and on into 2007.
2712100	2714100	I actually really enjoyed the Luminous mobile game.
2714100	2718100	There's been some other mobile games. I think DarkSakura found a couple she liked, too.
2718100	2721100	Maybe we're starting to come around a little bit on the mobile stuff.
2721100	2725100	Unfortunately, the only mobile story we've got for you this week is a little bit of a downer.
2725100	2730100	Microsoft is being sued by a French company, Infusio,
2730100	2733100	for the wrongful termination of a $2 million contract.
2733100	2738100	Infusio is claiming that Microsoft was refusing to approve their game designs,
2738100	2744100	wrongfully withholding the second of four $500,000 US dollar payments.
2744100	2750100	This is all in regards to the Halo mobile game that I suppose is in development.
2750100	2754100	I guess some disagreements there on the Halo mobile games.
2754100	2758100	Well, if you ever disagree with what we have to say, you can write us an angry email.
2758100	2762100	If you're immature enough, we'll just point and make fun of you.
2762100	2766100	But if you have pretty well thought out opinions, we're likely to read your emails on the show
2766100	2769100	because, you know, we're not saying our way or the highway.
2769100	2771100	It's an open forum from all gamers.
2771100	2774100	So send us your emails, mailbag at orangeonsureely.com,
2774100	2778100	and DarkSakura will rip open the mailbag and tear out a few emails she wants to read.
2778100	2780100	And that's what she's going to do right now.
2787100	2791100	The first email comes from Tim Tsurugi.
2791100	2796100	Hello, OLR. Of course, loving the show and hoping it never ends. Never.
2796100	2800100	It's always nice to hear y'all's charming personalities shine every week.
2800100	2805100	I'm terribly sorry for bothering y'all, but Sky Suggestion got me thinking about gambling games for the Wii.
2805100	2810100	If Nintendo ever decides to get on the ball and make some Wii DS connectivity set up,
2810100	2816100	you can very easily expand the playability of Wii gambling titles, such as playing poker or blackjack.
2816100	2820100	Combine this with online capabilities, and I believe there could be a fulfilling Wii title.
2820100	2823100	Heck, Wii Clubhouse Games. Why not?
2823100	2832100	The point is Nintendo's stubborn lack of celerity and grasping the online world is mind-bogglingly nonsensical.
2832100	2836100	Given Xbox 360's success through live, Nintendo could really take a hint.
2836100	2841100	On a side note, four-story sequel utilizing Wii DS connectivity would just plain rock.
2841100	2845100	Thanks for being so awesome and putting up with my annoying emails.
2845100	2850100	PS, you think Nintendo could reach out to the older community with games like Wii Are Old?
2850100	2854100	I'd like to get some mad shuffleboard action going on.
2854100	2856100	Wii Old?
2856100	2860100	To give credit where credit is due, wasn't that your idea, Loki, for the gambling games on the Wii?
2860100	2863100	I don't remember. I don't remember saying that. Maybe I did.
2863100	2865100	No, I never said anything about gambling games.
2865100	2867100	I might have been drinking. Well, I guess I did.
2867100	2870100	They have a World Series of Poker Tournament Champions, but that sucks.
2870100	2876100	We're talking about real money being gambled, but I think that would be a gray area that Nintendo...
2876100	2878100	Technically, gambling is illegal in Japan.
2878100	2881100	Well, that and that. Think about it.
2881100	2888100	Usually, those online gambling sites, you associate that with shadiness.
2888100	2892100	There are so many of them out there, and you always see the pop-up ads, and you go,
2892100	2894100	That's a little shady to me. I don't know if I want to get it.
2894100	2898100	Not to knock it if that's what you're into, but I'm sure you've done the research if you're going to spend money on it.
2898100	2901100	But you have to admit, there's a lot of crap out there that seems really shady.
2901100	2906100	So I wouldn't think Nintendo would want to damage their reputation with that.
2906100	2911100	Now, along the lines of what you say, like clubhouse games and those types of very casual games,
2911100	2917100	I think Xbox Live hit a goldmine with UNO, and I think Nintendo, if they were smart,
2917100	2921100	would be quick to get out a version of clubhouse games on the Wii or something like that
2921100	2923100	that kind of latches onto that where people could really do it.
2923100	2930100	But at the same time, I don't know if Wii is set up for that same type of online greatness, at least in what we know.
2930100	2933100	I mean, there might be unannounced things we don't know of yet, like there was on DS.
2933100	2937100	We didn't know that we'd be able to talk on the DS in certain games.
2937100	2942100	But Microsoft really has this rock-solid thing set up with Live,
2942100	2946100	and Nintendo is being a little slow about competing with that.
2946100	2952100	And the longer they take, the further ahead Microsoft's going to get ahead of them,
2952100	2956100	especially with the connectivity now with the 360 and the PC.
2956100	2961100	That's something that Nintendo can't do, so it's interesting.
2961100	2965100	I would think Nintendo would be trying to get a little bit of a move on, trying to get online,
2965100	2967100	but 2007 is going to be a big year.
2967100	2971100	I think Nintendo will make a move before the year is over,
2971100	2975100	and we'll really see what the full capability of their online stuff is.
2975100	2976100	The next email.
2976100	2978100	This is Hi, OLR.
2978100	2982100	I just thought I'd add to the anecdotal evidence that the PS3 is not selling
2982100	2985100	as well as Sony and the mainstream media would like you to believe.
2985100	2989100	In my continuing search for the Wii, I stopped into the usual big-box stores
2989100	2993100	as well as GameStop, EB Games, locations in my area fairly regularly.
2993100	2997100	This Saturday morning, I got up early and made my rounds once again.
2997100	3000100	At every stop on my journey, EB Games, Target, Walmart, Circuit City, Best Buy,
3000100	3004100	there were PS3s to be had, but not a single Wii in sight.
3004100	3008100	The Best Buy still has PS3s in stock from last week's flyer announcement.
3008100	3013100	I find this quite interesting and have to believe that the way too high price point,
3013100	3018100	lack of killer apps, and mounting bad press is really affecting the PS3 sales
3018100	3022100	while, at least at this moment, the Wii has all the momentum necessary
3022100	3026100	to sell every single unit put on the shelf, with people clamoring for more.
3026100	3029100	Two other small tidbits to note from the Saturday trip.
3029100	3032100	I was not the only person scavenging the stores for the Wii.
3032100	3037100	At several of my stops, I saw the same early 40s lady and her mother
3037100	3040100	also hoping to score an early morning Wii, pardon the pun.
3040100	3044100	The other tidbit is that while I was wandering aimlessly through the Target,
3044100	3046100	a woman came in and purchased an Xbox 360 system
3046100	3050100	while bypassing the two 60-gigabyte PS3s on display.
3050100	3051100	Sorry, Sony.
3051100	3053100	Keep up the good work on the podcast.
3053100	3055100	Your show is one of the two or three I look forward to every week
3055100	3058100	as it makes my daily grind that much easier to bear.
3058100	3060100	Thanks and take care.
3060100	3062100	Austin, OLR fan.
3062100	3063100	Well, thank you.
3063100	3066100	Again, we kind of got into it a little bit earlier on the show.
3066100	3069100	I think now that Christmas is over,
3069100	3072100	I don't think the demand for the PlayStation 3 is so much there,
3072100	3075100	and I think the media fear has a lot to do with that.
3075100	3078100	Very interesting though, the Nintendo still going,
3078100	3080100	but again, I'd be very interested to see.
3080100	3083100	I think we know that Nintendo has more systems out there at this time
3083100	3086100	than Nintendo or Xbox did this far out,
3086100	3089100	I mean, than Sony or Microsoft did this far out after launch,
3089100	3093100	but I just think it would be interesting still to see the comparison there.
3093100	3096100	But I do think it is pretty obvious
3096100	3099100	that Nintendo's kicking some serious booty right now,
3099100	3100100	but it's price.
3100100	3102100	It's all about the price.
3102100	3103100	This one's a quickie.
3103100	3104100	Just a random wee question.
3104100	3106100	What do they call the nunchuck attachment in England?
3106100	3109100	I believe it's still called the nunchuck, which I still think is a...
3109100	3110100	Who is that from?
3110100	3111100	Same person?
3111100	3112100	No different person.
3112100	3113100	Oh.
3113100	3114100	It wasn't signed.
3114100	3115100	Oh.
3115100	3118100	I don't read out email addresses or names through email,
3118100	3120100	so if it's not signed, I won't say your name.
3120100	3122100	Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's called the nunchuck.
3122100	3125100	I think we have some UK listeners in chat.
3125100	3126100	I think it's still called the nunchuck.
3126100	3127100	Okay.
3127100	3128100	Next one, actually.
3128100	3132100	Well, it's one from someone we've already gotten an email from,
3132100	3134100	but I'll go ahead and read it because it's quick.
3134100	3135100	Hello, OLR.
3135100	3137100	I've been an avid listener of your show ever since
3137100	3140100	I heard my friends talk about it around episode 175.
3140100	3144100	It's great just listening to y'all while tuning everything else out at work.
3144100	3146100	Makes time go by a lot quicker.
3146100	3148100	Anywho, my roommate Greg just had a thought about the Wii,
3148100	3150100	and I just thought I'd share it with y'all.
3150100	3154100	I hope y'all enjoy.
3154100	3156100	Actually, he didn't say what the thought was.
3156100	3158100	That might have been the other email.
3158100	3159100	Oh.
3159100	3161100	My bad.
3161100	3162100	Well, all right then.
3162100	3163100	Okay, I'm going to skip...
3163100	3164100	Well, I will say this, though.
3164100	3167100	Saisha, who left us the voicemail earlier from the UK,
3167100	3171100	he's actually in chat right now and confirms it is the nunchuck.
3171100	3172100	It's still called the nunchuck over there.
3172100	3173100	Okay.
3173100	3174100	So there you go.
3174100	3175100	We've got three more to go.
3175100	3176100	All right.
3176100	3180100	This one comes from Necky, who's another one of our UK listeners.
3180100	3182100	Hello, OLR.
3182100	3183100	Once again, it's me, Necky.
3183100	3185100	The New Year show was great, by the way.
3185100	3186100	Thank you.
3186100	3187100	It was fun.
3187100	3188100	Thanks.
3188100	3191100	Has anyone heard the news about the PSP Lite?
3191100	3196100	It also included a link from newstechspy.com.
3196100	3203100	The rest of the URL is articles06sonypsi.html.
3203100	3207100	The Wii is very hard to find over here at the moment and is a right pain.
3207100	3213100	I can't find any store with any in stock yet for 180 pounds.
3213100	3218100	I have to say, though, I was very tempted to get an Xbox 360 after playing Saints Row
3218100	3219100	yesterday.
3219100	3223100	Maybe I should get a 360 now and get a Wii later when there's better games out.
3223100	3224100	Your thoughts?
3224100	3227100	I'm enjoying my DS at the moment and hoping to keep doing so.
3227100	3230100	If you haven't already, check out Metroid Prime Hunters on DS.
3230100	3231100	It's fun.
3231100	3232100	Talk to you later, Necky.
3232100	3235100	Thanks for the email.
3235100	3237100	There was something in there I was going to say.
3237100	3239100	Now I forgot because I've got sidetracked.
3239100	3240100	What else did you say?
3240100	3242100	Just buying a 360 now and get a Wii later?
3242100	3245100	360 is a really good.
3245100	3249100	Again, it all comes down to, and if you've been listening to the show for any length
3249100	3253100	of time, we always say this golden rule of gaming is a system is only as good as the
3253100	3254100	games that are on it.
3254100	3255100	That's the golden rule of gaming.
3255100	3258100	It's really about what types of games do you want to be playing right now.
3258100	3261100	If you want to play Zelda, you want to play Trauma Center, you want to play WarioWare,
3261100	3262100	you got to go for the Wii.
3262100	3266100	If you want to be playing, you said you played Saints Row and if that was fun to you and
3266100	3271100	you want to play other types of sandbox games like that that are on their way to 360 such
3271100	3276100	as Grand Theft Auto later this year and some of the other Gears of War, whatever else 360
3276100	3282100	has to offer, Oblivion, Pinata, whatever, maybe that's the system for you.
3282100	3286100	If you're an online gamer, 360 is where it's at.
3286100	3290100	If you have a soft spot in your heart for the retro classics, Wii is where it's at
3290100	3292100	for the Nintendo stuff.
3292100	3295100	It's really about what you want, but be careful.
3295100	3299100	I know how sometimes money burns a hole in your pocket and it makes you make rash decisions
3299100	3304100	and I've done this many, many times especially with game purchases, but you'll thank yourself
3304100	3309100	if you take five minutes to really think about what you buy before you buy it.
3309100	3311100	Second to last email.
3311100	3316100	Hi guys, hope your New Year's was good and either peaceful or eventful in a good way.
3316100	3319100	That's a nice way to phrase it.
3319100	3323100	I had a long thought to state that considering my throat is coughing up, fur balls and other
3323100	3326100	dryness, I figured just to get into it.
3326100	3331100	Playing Elite Beat Agents, I've managed to get to the third difficulty level and notice something.
3331100	3336100	The final songs in particular, Without a Fight and the Jumpin' Jack Flash cover, I noticed
3336100	3341100	how it just matched the mood of the scenario, even getting goosebumps when the songs were being played.
3341100	3347100	It got me to think about some of the boss slash climactic battles in video games over the years.
3347100	3350100	How listening to the music just adds to the battle to make it more memorable.
3350100	3354100	So I was wondering, what were some of your favorite songs used in boss battles?
3354100	3362100	Well, that's all for now as my throat is causing me to be cloudy right now.
3362100	3366100	See you guys at the chatroom and that's DDR Dollar Reel.
3366100	3372100	You've actually become one of my good Doctor Who fandom buddies.
3372100	3379100	I actually agree, I thought those songs fit the mood so well in Elite Beat Agents,
3379100	3385100	and yet another reason why I think it is a travesty that that game is not ending up on more best of 06 lists.
3385100	3388100	I think it was seriously one of the absolute best games.
3388100	3390100	I'm sorry, it's better than Guitar Hero 2.
3390100	3392100	It is, it really is.
3392100	3395100	I guess that's my opinion, take it or leave it.
3395100	3401100	I think the game is being horribly underlooked and I think people are passing off the song list
3401100	3403100	without really sitting down and trying it.
3403100	3407100	Because I'll tell you what, if you got turned off by the fact that it has Ashley Simpson,
3407100	3412100	Lala, Avril Lavigne, Sk8er Boi, trust me, the music fits better than you're giving it credit for.
3412100	3414100	So give it a try, give it a try.
3414100	3416100	And yeah, those songs really fit the mood.
3416100	3418100	As far as boss battles, I was going to say,
3418100	3422100	Hello, Final Fantasy VII, One Winged Angel, who doesn't remember the Sephiroth?
3422100	3426100	I mean, we still use that music on this program today.
3426100	3427100	That's the ad that children read.
3427100	3429100	That is like the epic boss battle music.
3429100	3434100	I mean, yeah, this is the avid children one in particular.
3434100	3436100	But, you know, who?
3436100	3438100	Badass music.
3438100	3443100	I remember, though, how long that took because I did the Knights of the Round Quadra Magic combo.
3443100	3446100	Just casting it, going and making a sandwich, and hearing One Winged Angel in the background.
3446100	3448100	It was really cool.
3448100	3455100	If I want to go way old school, think about some of the 8-bit games that had some great final boss music.
3455100	3459100	And I don't know, one that sticks out in my mind for whatever awkward reason,
3459100	3463100	I think just one of the first songs I remember, was Remember Super Mario Bros. 2?
3463100	3469100	When you finally made it to Wart, and you fought him, and it had some pretty cool final boss battle music.
3469100	3471100	It was pretty cool.
3471100	3473100	It sticks out in my mind for whatever reason.
3473100	3478100	I also do have to say, I really...
3478100	3483100	Oh, and how ironic, Junami actually just mentioned both of them.
3483100	3489100	I was going to say all of the wily stage musics in the various Mega Man, Rock Man games.
3489100	3491100	I was noticing that. DMN said that, too.
3491100	3493100	I fully, fully agree.
3493100	3500100	The first one actually was even decent, but the Mega Man games just had awesome music at any rate.
3500100	3512100	There was the Jenova battle in Final Fantasy VII, too, from the first disc right after Stupid Crack Whore gets killed.
3512100	3520100	I think that that was actually some pretty good music for boss battles.
3520100	3522100	Our chat room is getting in the fun on this here.
3522100	3525100	Shadow Charlie says, final battle music for Sonic 3.
3525100	3529100	GS68 says, destination blackout from MT2.
3529100	3532100	Rama says, Bowser theme from Mario Bros. 3.
3532100	3535100	GS68 says, the final battle music from Final Fantasy IV.
3535100	3542100	I do have to agree with the Chrono Trigger ones, just the Lavos battle.
3542100	3548100	I especially love just going after you've beaten the game a few times on New Game Plus,
3548100	3553100	going back and just doing it right away, and then you get the Maker's ending.
3553100	3556100	Or even better, The Legend of Max.
3556100	3557100	No!
3557100	3560100	For DDR? Kinda. Kinda.
3560100	3566100	Actually, Guitar Man, the last level music in Guitar Man was pretty hardcore.
3566100	3573100	To me, those songs don't invoke that same emotional response that I think was alluded to in the email.
3573100	3576100	Any more emails? One more?
3576100	3581100	Yes, we do have one more email.
3581100	3585100	And this one comes from Holy Shonen.
3585100	3592100	Dear OLR, I'm a huge fan, have enjoyed your show greatly for the past year and a half.
3592100	3595100	Just recently started being in the chat room, don't call me a noob.
3595100	3598100	We call people noobs with the biggest of affections.
3598100	3602100	No, I know, yeah. We say noob less than three.
3602100	3605100	Less than three, that's a heart on its side.
3605100	3609100	Anyway, I was wondering if you could help me with a problem I'm having.
3609100	3612100	My desktop just died and I need a new one.
3612100	3617100	Since my desktop would be for gaming, music, movies, etc., I was thinking of getting a PC.
3617100	3625100	However, since I love my MacBook so much, I thought I could get a good Mac with two operating systems so that my PC-only games actually run on it.
3625100	3628100	I'm not sure I need advice. Always weird, Holy Shonen.
3628100	3632100	P.S., Loki, I love you, but I cannot support your hatred of Mac computers.
3632100	3633100	Smiley.
3633100	3636100	Smiley, Loki, smiley.
3636100	3643100	This is something that I was going to do, except it was a little cost prohibitive for me at this junction in my life.
3643100	3653100	Also, given that I have a massive library of PC-only stuff, and that, and we've got the parts sitting in my garage to actually build me a new computer.
3653100	3661100	I was going to get the 24-inch widescreen iMac and dual formatted PC and Mac.
3661100	3667100	I did run virtual PC as well. I don't know how well it works on the new builds.
3667100	3670100	What is my laptop doing?
3670100	3673100	For me, it's a little early for that whole dual format thing for me.
3673100	3676100	It's still kind of a new technology in my mind.
3676100	3678100	I'm not ready for that.
3678100	3682100	It's the same as having Linux and Windows on the same box.
3682100	3684100	I wouldn't do that to my machine.
3684100	3687100	It's the same as having two different versions of Windows.
3687100	3694100	Let me just put it this way. Me personally, I have a, I don't even know the name of my freaking little, was that an iBook, the laptop?
3694100	3695100	Yeah, you have an iBook.
3695100	3696100	I have an iBook.
3696100	3699100	I have an iBook, and I just call it my Apple laptop.
3699100	3701100	I have an iBook, and I have a PC desktop, and I love it.
3701100	3702100	I love that setup.
3702100	3704100	I have the best of both worlds.
3704100	3706100	I recommend folks do the same.
3706100	3707100	I think it's great.
3707100	3708100	It's a great combo.
3708100	3714100	The only real reason that I was really wanting the Mac stuff myself is being a graphic artist.
3714100	3719100	But honestly, I've done great quality work on my PC.
3719100	3723100	At this point in my life, you know, it's really a matter of your preference.
3723100	3729100	I think if you are doing graphics professionally, video editing professionally, Mac is the way to go.
3729100	3735100	But if you're doing it for yourself or casually like me, then I don't see as much of a point in it.
3735100	3737100	I think they're great systems.
3737100	3740100	I think it just depends on what you want to do with it.
3740100	3742100	I like how much space they save.
3742100	3746100	I got a private message from someone that said, you know, it's just do a booting.
3746100	3748100	What's the big reservation?
3748100	3749100	I don't know.
3749100	3752100	Maybe I'm being stupid with it, and you're right.
3752100	3756100	Folks do Linux and Windows and that stuff all the time, so what's the big deal?
3756100	3757100	I don't know.
3757100	3764100	I don't see the need to do that on my desktop to have the Mac and the PC when I have a Mac laptop.
3764100	3765100	You know what I mean?
3765100	3772100	If I need Apple for something, but I don't have that graphical and music need or whatever.
3772100	3773100	The Apples are very strong.
3773100	3774100	I don't have that need.
3774100	3781100	I just like the fact that one thing I do use my Macintosh for a lot is I like author DVDs.
3781100	3784100	My really good friend John takes a lot of pictures, and I make DVDs out of them.
3784100	3786100	The Mac is awesome for that.
3786100	3789100	I love it compared to anything I've tried on the PC.
3789100	3790100	Little things like that.
3790100	3794100	I get all that out of my laptop, so I don't have the need for this whole dual boot thing.
3794100	3797100	To me, it's kind of a waste of resources.
3797100	3801100	For me, personally, I'm not criticizing anyone else that wants to do it, but I'm just saying for me.
3801100	3804100	Jaded in here runs four operating systems.
3804100	3809100	Actually, what I was thinking about doing myself, because I actually want to learn Linux a little bit better.
3809100	3814100	When we rebuild my new computer, I'm actually going to have two-
3814100	3821100	My plan is to have two 20 gig hard drives in it as my boot drives, one with Linux, one with-
3821100	3829100	My new system's going to be- I can run Visa on it, so I'm taking out my 250 right now,
3829100	3836100	putting it in a USB case, which ironically, the one I'm looking at is called Metal Gear,
3836100	3843100	and having that be portable between my laptop and my PC so that anything that I want, anything I need to do,
3843100	3850100	there it is, and 20 gig will easily store the programs I want to run.
3850100	3851100	Any more emails?
3851100	3853100	No, but this proves that we're big dorks.
3853100	3855100	I guess, a little bit.
3855100	3861100	All right, if you have more emails you want to send, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send them,
3861100	3865100	and we also offer and welcome interaction through our Skype line,
3865100	3868100	which will be open very soon after another little chunk of stories here.
3868100	3870100	You might want to get your Skype fired up.
3870100	3874100	It's username Orange Lounge Radio or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3874100	3879100	We'll let you know when those are open, but we have a couple quick final stories here for you.
3879100	3880100	Loki.
3880100	3885100	Of course, a big one, I think, this week, GameStop purchased Rhino Video Games.
3885100	3890100	Now, for those of you who might not be in the United States, especially on the East Coast,
3890100	3892100	you might not know of Rhino Video Games.
3892100	3900100	They're actually a chain that's in the Southeast, and they brought a 72-store chain.
3900100	3906100	It's pretty large, and they were kind of competing with GameStop offering some better trade-in deals
3906100	3912100	and a popular two-for-one deal and trade-in to use items, get one free.
3912100	3915100	So, lots of good stuff there, but it is official.
3915100	3920100	The Blockbuster-owned company Rhino Video Games has been bought by GameStop,
3920100	3925100	and this isn't really huge news, I think.
3925100	3926100	Well, for you it is.
3926100	3930100	Well, for me it's not, because we've kind of known that something like this is going to happen.
3930100	3931100	Really?
3931100	3935100	Blockbuster has been entertaining offers for a while now for Rhino Video Games.
3935100	3940100	I know because we sell to them, so it's not a huge surprise.
3940100	3945100	Blockbuster is trying to kind of recover some losses and stuff,
3945100	3952100	and they don't really want to go focus right now on video games, mainly more movies.
3952100	3954100	Yeah, they've got Netflix to worry about.
3954100	3958100	Yeah, it's kind of a disappointment to see them being bought up,
3958100	3962100	because I hear they're a very good store chain.
3962100	3963100	Where do they exist mostly?
3963100	3964100	We don't have them here in California.
3964100	3971100	The southeast, no, the southern east, over north South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama.
3971100	3973100	I know Rhino.
3973100	3979100	So, that's pretty much where they were located.
3979100	3982100	I want to say they have like 72 locations, if I remember correctly.
3982100	3987100	See, here in California we've always had GameStop, pretty much,
3987100	3991100	because previously we always had Software, etc., and Funkoland.
3991100	3992100	Bappages.
3992100	3994100	Yeah, they all got absolved.
3994100	3996100	I don't remember Bappages here in California.
3996100	4001100	Bappages, keep in mind GameStop is also owned by Barnes & Noble, Inc.
4001100	4003100	I think they're fully owned subsidiaries,
4003100	4009100	so Bappages since Bappages was Barnes & Noble's arm for games and tech.
4009100	4013100	The Barnes & Noble's craze, from my recollection,
4013100	4017100	did not really start here in this state until about ten years ago, and that whole thing.
4017100	4020100	Those stores did not start going up until about ten years ago.
4020100	4024100	It was always Waldenbooks, which is borders, essentially.
4024100	4028100	Well, apparently the whole thing is supposed to go down on the 14th.
4028100	4032100	That's when I guess it's going to become official and they're going to start.
4032100	4036100	I don't know if they're going to either convert these stores over to GameStops,
4036100	4038100	which I hear that might be what's going to happen,
4038100	4042100	or if it's going to be like this whole GameStop, EB thing,
4042100	4047100	where they're still GameStop and EB, but they're owned by GameStop type thing.
4047100	4051100	Kind of like Movie Gallery and Hollywood Video,
4051100	4055100	they're both independent, but they're owned by the same company type thing.
4055100	4057100	Interesting.
4057100	4060100	Movie Gallery is another one we don't have out here, but they have other places.
4060100	4061100	Actually, we do.
4061100	4062100	Do we?
4062100	4063100	Yes.
4063100	4066100	We have locally, for us, for those in the Sacramento area,
4066100	4069100	I think the closest one is in Placerville.
4069100	4071100	Huh. That's news to me.
4071100	4074100	Don't they rep porn at Movie Gallery?
4074100	4075100	I don't know.
4075100	4077100	I think so, actually. I've been in a Movie Gallery.
4077100	4078100	Sweet.
4078100	4080100	My dad used to flirt with the lady behind the counter.
4080100	4082100	Just go to the Video Clearance Center.
4082100	4083100	They have tons of porn there.
4083100	4086100	In fact, they carry more porn than, I think, actual videos now.
4086100	4089100	They actually said, I went into one and they said they had a green door
4089100	4091100	that you could go behind to buy the porn.
4091100	4093100	They actually had to paint their door.
4093100	4095100	Paint it green?
4095100	4098100	Somebody raised a stink and they had to paint over the green door.
4098100	4100100	With what?
4100100	4102100	I think it's purple now.
4102100	4104100	Okay, so now it's a purple door.
4104100	4105100	What's it?
4105100	4107100	Go behind the green door to buy it.
4107100	4108100	Never mind.
4108100	4109100	Okay.
4109100	4110100	Anyway, forget it.
4110100	4113100	Look.
4113100	4117100	This is so horrible that we have to follow up that topic with this,
4117100	4120100	but it's just the way it was scripted, folks.
4120100	4121100	Let's talk about charity.
4121100	4123100	We'll go to the opposite end of the spectrum,
4123100	4126100	from buying porn to donating to charity.
4126100	4129100	Of course, one charity a lot of gamers know about
4129100	4132100	is Penny Arcade's Child Play charity,
4132100	4136100	and they raised over $1 million this year.
4136100	4140100	It was posted on the Child's Play website this week that,
4140100	4141100	quote, you guys did it.
4141100	4143100	You broke $1 million in just over two months.
4143100	4146100	Child's Play started as a way to show how good our community can be,
4146100	4149100	but it's turned into something greater than we could have ever imagined.
4149100	4151100	We're making an impact on lives.
4151100	4152100	See you next year.
4152100	4155100	They're at $1,024,400.
4155100	4156100	That's great.
4156100	4157100	That's awesome.
4157100	4158100	Congratulations.
4158100	4161100	I think it's a damn shame the media won't ever cover that.
4161100	4164100	In the same capacity that they cover, I should say,
4164100	4167100	because I'm sure they get a nice story here and there,
4167100	4172100	but in the same way that Game Boy Electrocute Small Child,
4172100	4175100	kids go and shoot up their schools because of video games,
4175100	4177100	it's never going to get the same.
4177100	4181100	That documentary, not really a documentary,
4181100	4186100	but that documentary on video game violence called Moral Combat,
4186100	4193100	I think you'd find better quality behind the beaded doors in a movie gallery.
4193100	4195100	Behind the purple door.
4195100	4200100	At any rate, speaking of quality, and I vote this for quality,
4200100	4207100	Guitar Hero 2 360 is going to have additional content.
4207100	4210100	They're not really saying much about it.
4210100	4214100	Rumor has it that it might be new modes, downloadable content,
4214100	4218100	probably for new songs coming out, sort of like how Karaoke Revolution goes.
4218100	4225100	Putting out the original Guitar Hero songs with extra bass or rhythm guitar,
4225100	4228100	I think that'd be pretty cool.
4228100	4231100	And it does say though, right on the box,
4231100	4236100	that there are additional songs and downloadable content.
4236100	4237100	Sweet.
4237100	4239100	I know there was a reason I was holding out for this game on the 360,
4239100	4241100	and this is exactly why.
4241100	4247100	And yes, I do realize I was saying things that may seem a little anti-Guitar Hero
4247100	4249100	earlier in the show, but I'm really not.
4249100	4251100	I really do like Guitar Hero a lot.
4251100	4253100	I just don't think it's God's gift to gaming.
4253100	4257100	I think there were better games that came out in 06 and so on.
4257100	4259100	But I've been holding out to buy this.
4259100	4261100	I've played it on PS2, and sure, it's fun,
4261100	4264100	but I've been holding out for 360, and I knew that this was why.
4264100	4266100	I'm also going to link in the chat room,
4266100	4273100	though there is a picture of this up on a Team Xbox site
4273100	4277100	that has what the box art is.
4277100	4280100	So I'm posting that right now.
4280100	4284100	The box art was very interesting looking to me, I have to say.
4284100	4286100	But very cool, I liked it.
4286100	4287100	I'm looking forward to it.
4287100	4288100	You know I'm going to get it anyway.
4288100	4289100	I know you will.
4289100	4290100	All right.
4290100	4294100	We are going to open up our Skype line over at orangelaundry.com.
4294100	4296100	Click on interact with us for more details,
4296100	4298100	but I'll give you some of the low down right now.

4303100	4306100	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

4311100	4314100	International listeners, you may want to look into the Skype thing
4314100	4318100	because they will charge your ass if you use the telephone.
4318100	4319100	Let's go to the phones.
4319100	4320100	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4320100	4322100	Who's this?
4322100	4323100	It's Nim.
4323100	4324100	Oh, Nim.
4324100	4325100	Hi, Nim.
4325100	4326100	What's on your mind, buddy?
4326100	4327100	Not much, really.
4327100	4329100	I didn't expect to get it through.
4329100	4330100	Well, you did.
4330100	4332100	You don't have anything you want to share with us tonight?
4332100	4334100	Why did you call?
4334100	4336100	Oh, yeah.
4336100	4340100	I was making a kibi.
4340100	4341100	You were making what?
4341100	4343100	The computer.
4343100	4345100	You were making what?
4345100	4346100	A new game.
4346100	4349100	Oh, you're the one that messaged Loki earlier
4349100	4351100	and said you're making this game called kibi.
4351100	4352100	Yeah.
4352100	4354100	What is this all about?
4354100	4361100	Well, it's going to run off of a modified version of StepMania.
4361100	4367100	A couple of the OLR mates are going to help us with it.
4367100	4369100	And, yeah, that's pretty much all we're doing.
4369100	4371100	We're looking for artists and such.
4371100	4375100	Have you made a post in our forums about it?
4375100	4376100	No.
4376100	4378100	Right now it's pretty much underground.
4378100	4381100	Well, now you just outed it to all the folks that listen to the program.
4381100	4383100	So go post on the forums.
4383100	4384100	I'm sure you can get some help.
4384100	4385100	And good luck to you on the project.
4385100	4387100	All right.
4387100	4390100	So it's supposed to be a BeatMania-ish game,
4390100	4395100	but with DDR's interface?
4395100	4396100	Turn down your radio.
4396100	4397100	Hold on a second.
4397100	4398100	Yeah, that's what I thought.
4398100	4400100	See, I could hear myself in the background.
4400100	4401100	Turn down the radio.
4401100	4403100	When you call radio programs, turn down the radio.
4403100	4405100	Have you seen Death Metal Force, Rob?
4405100	4407100	That's because I love Guar.
4407100	4408100	Damn headphones.
4408100	4409100	All right, no, that's right.
4409100	4413100	So anyway, what was I going to say?
4413100	4415100	So this is what DDR...
4415100	4418100	It's based on a DDR interface, but it's BeatMania.
4418100	4422100	Yeah, have you seen the videos of StepMania?
4422100	4425100	Yeah, and I always thought...
4425100	4430100	99% of people who play StepMania are just doing finger-finger revolution.
4430100	4433100	Very few people are actually hooking up dance pads at the computer.
4433100	4435100	So I think it's a good idea.
4435100	4439100	To make something that's actually not pretending to be actual dancing.
4439100	4440100	Yeah, I know.
4440100	4441100	That's the point.
4441100	4442100	Great!
4442100	4443100	Then I fully support this project.
4443100	4444100	Yeah.
4444100	4445100	All right.
4445100	4446100	I'll draw you a picture.
4446100	4447100	Good luck to you.
4447100	4449100	I'll do announcer packs if you need it.
4449100	4450100	All right.
4450100	4451100	Thanks, guys.
4451100	4452100	All right, no problem.
4452100	4453100	Good luck with your project.
4453100	4457100	And keep us informed on the forums or whatever, all right?
4457100	4461100	All right, well, I guess he hung up.
4461100	4469100	If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
4469100	4470100	Let's go to the phones.
4470100	4471100	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
4471100	4472100	Who's this?
4472100	4474100	This is Paradox Vincent.
4474100	4476100	Hi, Paradox Vincent.
4476100	4478100	What's on your mind, buddy?
4478100	4487100	Well, I was picking my friend up a game at GameStop recently, and they had a Game Informer
4487100	4491100	and a display, so I picked it up and I flipped through the reviews.
4491100	4495100	I thought they gave Wii Sports a 6.5 out of 5.
4495100	4500100	Wait, they gave Wii Sports a 6.5 out of 5?
4500100	4501100	Yeah.
4501100	4504100	Is that a typo or something?
4504100	4505100	No.
4505100	4510100	How do you give a game a 6.5 out of 5?
4510100	4512100	Do I think they gave it one?
4512100	4513100	Yeah.
4513100	4517100	I think they gave it one because it's not like Gears of War.
4517100	4525100	It's not this hyper polished first person shooter that takes years upon years to make.
4525100	4527100	It's just a simple little sports game.
4527100	4531100	You meant to say 6.5 out of 10, right?
4531100	4532100	Yeah.
4532100	4533100	Okay, there it is.
4533100	4535100	Okay, so I was thinking, what, 6.5 out of 5?
4535100	4539100	Are they giving it multiple scores because there's four or five games in it?
4539100	4541100	Okay, so they gave it 6.5 out of 10.
4541100	4542100	Okay, now I got you.
4542100	4549100	So they gave it a bit of a lower score because it's not a pretty game, I suppose is what
4549100	4550100	you're saying.
4550100	4556100	Yeah, but the thing is that every single person that I've showed this game to, they've absolutely
4556100	4557100	loved it.
4557100	4566100	She was an older woman, a middle aged woman, come up to my mom and says, hey, have you
4566100	4570100	checked out Wii Bowling?
4570100	4579100	And for someone of that age to come up to another woman of a similar age and discuss
4579100	4584100	a video game with them, I think Nintendo's done exactly what they wanted to do in the
4584100	4585100	first place.
4585100	4588100	Yeah, it's like you're living in Bizarro World for a minute when your parents are the ones
4588100	4589100	talking about games.
4589100	4591100	Let me quote the review real quick.
4591100	4597100	Their basic breakdown of this, this is a concept, an uneven intro into the system and its controllers,
4597100	4599100	but at least it's free.
4599100	4602900	Graphics, they say the game uses Mii avatars on your Wii, but that's about the only eye
4602900	4604900	catching thing about it.
4604900	4608580	The tiny sound that comes from the Wii remote really starting to bug me.
4608580	4613420	It says playability, sometimes there are inconsistencies between your movement and what happens on
4613420	4614420	screen.
4614420	4618700	Entertainment, this is a shallow game by design, but it does offer some occasional fun.
4618700	4622100	Replay moderately low, which I don't really agree with.
4622100	4627700	Yeah, and you know what, look, gosh, I'm going into rant mode here in a minute, hold
4627700	4628700	on.
4628700	4629700	All right.
4629700	4635900	The gaming media as it stands today is in for a rude awakening because of what Nintendo
4635900	4636900	is doing here.
4636900	4641300	I mean, look at the way that most critics really dog the hell out of Excite Truck.
4641300	4643380	Yet, again, it's the same thing.
4643380	4647020	We showed this game to non-gamers and they love it.
4647020	4651180	For people that have been playing games a while, yeah, Burnout's a prettier game.
4651180	4655960	Yeah, Test Drive Unlimited was a really revolutionary game with its online system and these games
4655960	4659680	were fantastic, but Excite Truck kept it simple.
4659680	4663420	People picked up this thing and just went and loved it and loved the control and loved
4663420	4666540	being able to move the control.
4666540	4670780	You remember back in the day if you ever let a non-gamer or even some regular gamers would
4670780	4675660	play an old 8-bit game, they'd move their body with the controller and when they jumped
4675660	4677820	they'd pull back and all that stuff.
4677820	4682260	Nintendo made that a part of the game.
4682260	4685620	When they said they were going new generation, they meant it.
4685620	4688860	That's why I think a lot of people that have been in this line of thinking for a while
4688860	4691760	are going to be in for Rude Awakening pretty soon.
4691760	4694860	Nintendo is not making games necessarily for the hardcore gamer.
4694860	4695860	So you know what?
4695860	4700620	I urge you guys out there who read a lot of these reviews, and it's not just this particular
4700620	4703160	one, but think about all these stories we've had lately.
4703160	4707940	We had EGM Bash Elibits when a lot of folks feel it didn't need it.
4707940	4712380	We had GameSpot, heaven forbid, didn't give Zelda a 9 or a 10 and they received the wrath
4712380	4715420	of Nintendo fanboys everywhere.
4715420	4720860	I think it is very interesting that the common theme here is all Nintendo Wii games.
4720860	4726620	The other thing too is people need to understand these are critics.
4726620	4734900	Here's a website I recommend checking out, metacritic.com.
4734900	4736500	Definitely check it out because they break down.
4736500	4742300	They have a list of all the scores at different magazines and websites and whatnot published.
4742300	4744820	We don't have anything on here.
4744820	4747980	They also, but it does give an average and it also has user averages.
4747980	4752460	That's a really good place to look, especially if you're wondering if a game is good or not.
4752460	4756020	Don't read one magazine or a couple of magazines because certain people have certain tastes
4756020	4757020	in magazines.
4757020	4759340	For example, if I were rating a sports game, I'd probably give it a little score because
4759340	4761460	I hate sports games.
4761460	4766240	That's not fair, but unfortunately, there are biased reviews out there.
4766240	4769660	That's why you need websites like this or just to kind of...
4769660	4770660	Awesome.
4770660	4771660	Well, here it is.
4771660	4772660	You're already doing the right thing.
4772660	4778220	You found an internet podcast with gamers who probably game somewhat similarly to you.
4778220	4782100	A lot of the people who wrote us and said that they appreciated our opinions and things
4782100	4786540	like that were gamers that play a lot of the similar games we do.
4786540	4787800	Maybe you disagree with us.
4787800	4789180	Maybe you listen to the top 10 list.
4789180	4792060	Loki and I and Dark Soccer said earlier in the show and you're like, God, they're full
4792060	4793060	of crap.
4793060	4797020	Well, then go out and find another one of the hundreds of video game podcasts that are
4797020	4801740	out there being produced by independent gamers like you and me that have similar tastes.
4801740	4805460	I think that is where things are headed and that's why I say that the traditional gaming
4805460	4808380	press is in for a rude awakening very soon.
4808380	4809860	Oh, yeah.
4809860	4811420	All right.
4811420	4812580	Any other thoughts?
4812580	4813820	I've been dominating the conversation.
4813820	4814820	I apologize.
4814820	4817820	What do you think, buddy?
4817820	4818820	I agree with you.
4818820	4826120	I think that if they are in for a rude awakening, I'm really welcoming that because up until
4826120	4831700	now, it's kind of been viewed... I mean, gaming has been viewed as a very nerd culture.
4831700	4838620	I think that just being able to interact with something that's on TV isn't evil.
4838620	4841700	It's not obscure.
4841700	4848420	It's pretty natural for me, so I think that if somebody can just sit down and have fun
4848420	4855460	with a game, then I think that's exactly what Nintendo wants them to do and that's exactly
4855460	4860020	what I think they are going to and I'm hoping they're going to achieve.
4860020	4864580	Out of curiosity, outside of Nintendo Power, can anyone, whether on the phone or here in
4864580	4869740	the room, think of... Is there a magazine out there geared towards the casual gamer?
4869740	4870740	No.
4870740	4874620	I'm not necessarily saying that Nintendo Power is like that magazine, but you know what I
4874620	4875620	mean?
4875620	4880100	Like something that would maybe give the Wii game reviews the perspective that the big
4880100	4882280	boys are missing out on?
4882280	4884220	Is there any type of publication like that right now?
4884220	4885660	Not that I know of.
4885660	4886660	Maybe there ought to be.
4886660	4887660	Specifically the gaming.
4887660	4888660	I don't know.
4888660	4892460	Maybe they figured that because they're casual gamers, they wouldn't want to buy magazines
4892460	4893460	about gaming.
4893460	4894460	I don't know.
4894460	4895460	Just kind of wondering.
4895460	4897540	Well, maybe you need to look at reviews.
4897540	4901420	If you want to look at what casual gamers think, you need to look at game reviews as
4901420	4907700	a subsection of bigger magazines like the game reviews in Entertainment Weekly or the
4907700	4912580	game reviews in Time and Newsweek and that's why I find it very fascinating that you have
4912580	4915140	magazines like Time and Newsweek or whichever one of those.
4915140	4916140	Forbes.
4916140	4917220	Wii Sports, the game of the year.
4917220	4918220	I don't know.
4918220	4919220	It's just fascinating.
4919220	4923940	But then again, for a casual gamer, just like he said, grandma's talking to grandma about
4923940	4924940	Wii bowling.
4924940	4929420	Yeah, but see, these people are also going to say, oh, the Wii is the best system in
4929420	4933880	the fucking world because you swing around in the game and it's more interactive.
4933880	4936220	That's not a really informed decision.
4936220	4942100	That's just, I see something different, ooh, shiny.
4942100	4943100	I don't know.
4943100	4946580	It's just kind of on the other end of the spectrum instead of having someone that's
4946580	4950700	really hardcore into a game, you have someone reviewing a game that knows jack shit about
4950700	4956620	games and they're reviewing it just because Nintendo told them it's an awesome game, oh,
4956620	4957620	it's an awesome game.
4957620	4959620	So, I don't know.
4959620	4960620	All right.
4960620	4964260	Well, any other thoughts you want to share with our listeners, Paradox Vincent?
4964260	4966780	Trauma Center is amazing.
4966780	4967780	It is.
4967780	4968780	It is great.
4968780	4972060	Horribly under looked and if you own a Wii, you owe it to yourself to at least rent this
4972060	4974500	damn game and check it out.
4974500	4976780	I think it's pretty.
4976780	4982500	I mean, I'm spoiled by the 360s graphics and you know what little I've seen of the PlayStation
4982500	4983500	3.
4983500	4987340	The graphics in Trauma Center, not that thrilling, but that's not the point.
4987340	4989340	That's not the point of Trauma Center.
4989340	4991040	Oh, yeah.
4991040	4993100	And I think I'm not surprised.
4993100	4996360	Once again, I'm sure the mainstream gaming press kind of missed that, but the game is
4996360	4998700	more fun than a lot of games I've played in a long time.
4998700	5001500	Anyway, we got to let you go, Paradox Vincent, so we can take other calls, but thanks so
5001500	5005580	much for inspiring the lively chat we've had here.
5005580	5006580	All right.
5006580	5007580	Just saying.
5007580	5008580	All right.
5008580	5009580	Take care, buddy.
5009580	5010580	You too.
5010580	5011580	Bye-bye.
5011580	5013380	Let's go to another phone call, shall we?
5013380	5016380	Let's go to this call.
5016380	5017940	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5017940	5019100	Who's this?
5019100	5020100	This is DMN.
5020100	5021100	Oh, boy.
5021100	5022100	You always...
5022100	5023100	Hi.
5023100	5024100	You always manage to get through.
5024100	5025100	Hi.
5025100	5027100	When are you coming to visit me again?
5027100	5028100	May.
5028100	5029100	Okay.
5029100	5030940	Yeah, they're planning.
5030940	5034900	The rest of OLR's contributors are planning something big for the fifth anniversary of
5034900	5038980	OLR, which, by the way, I forgot to say this at the top of the show, but this episode would
5038980	5042300	mark our third year of podcasting, or our third birthday.
5042300	5043300	Yay.
5043300	5044300	Yay.
5044300	5045300	Whatever.
5045300	5046300	Okay.
5046300	5047300	Great.
5047300	5048300	And then we were forced to eat Rob's shoes.
5048300	5050060	You can only celebrate so many landmark shows.
5050060	5051060	So anyway, whatever.
5051060	5052700	DMN, what's on your mind tonight?
5052700	5053700	Two things.
5053700	5056980	It was one, but that previous call fired up some other things.
5056980	5059380	One, I'm disappointed in the three of you.
5059380	5060380	Why?
5060380	5061380	I didn't do it.
5061380	5062380	You did, Jamie.
5062380	5063380	No.
5063380	5067340	I did not hear Okami out of any one of you three.
5067340	5069900	I didn't play Okami.
5069900	5070900	Interesting, huh?
5070900	5076460	I think it's because PS2 games, late generation PS2 games, are being horribly overlooked in
5076460	5081980	this last push towards the next gen of gaming, and yeah, I guess I'm a little bit guilty
5081980	5082980	of that.
5082980	5086540	But again, it's kind of one of those cases where if I had more, if I had a top 20 or
5086540	5089540	a top 15, probably Okami would have made it.
5089540	5093340	Or even, it could have been my number 10, but I had to say Sneaking.
5093340	5094340	I had to.
5094340	5100500	Well, yeah, but I mean, for one, Okami was my game of the year, if anybody was an SDFU.
5100500	5101500	All three of you.
5101500	5102500	No, we don't listen to it.
5102500	5103500	Ok.
5103500	5109260	Okami was my game of the year, and I was surprised that none of you guys said it.
5109260	5110580	So you guys saw it.
5110580	5111580	I didn't play it.
5111580	5114940	And there's probably 500 other people out there listening going, why didn't they rank
5114940	5115940	this game higher?
5115940	5117580	Why didn't they put this game on the list?
5117580	5118580	Why not this?
5118580	5119580	Why not that?
5119580	5120580	You know what?
5120580	5124220	That's the whole point of Top List, is it's just one opinion and take it or leave it.
5124220	5125220	Yeah.
5125220	5127500	I'm not saying Okami's a bad game by any means.
5127500	5129180	It's fantastic, but you know.
5129180	5131660	Ok, good, because if you said it's a bad game, I'd punch you in the face.
5131660	5132660	No, I don't feel that way at all.
5132660	5135300	That means you'd have to come here to do it, and I'd have to catch it on film.
5135300	5136300	I didn't.
5136300	5137300	Exactly.
5137300	5138300	I did not get it.
5138300	5141580	Well, I left Gears of War off my top 10, and Gears of War wouldn't even be in my top 20.
5141580	5142580	But that's just me personally.
5142580	5145240	I was severely disappointed by Gears of War.
5145240	5149900	Go back and listen to me supporting Michelle from Video Game Outsiders in last week's episode.
5149900	5152500	She felt the same way I did.
5152500	5154060	It wasn't all that.
5154060	5156140	It was pretty, and that's it.
5156140	5157220	To me.
5157220	5159260	But anyway.
5159260	5163620	Number two is Nintendo Power for about the past year hasn't really been catered toward
5163620	5164620	the casual gamer.
5164620	5167700	They've changed their outlook on things.
5167700	5171460	I wasn't trying to say Nintendo Power was a casual gamer's magazine, but I was trying
5171460	5178460	to think, what magazine is reviewing Wii games from the perspective of, I am not a hardcore
5178460	5179460	gamer.
5179460	5182620	I'm someone who just likes to have fun.
5182620	5184980	What gaming magazine could Nelly read?
5184980	5185980	None of them.
5185980	5186980	None of them.
5186980	5187980	I'll tell you why.
5187980	5189900	First of all, you see shitty games.
5189900	5196020	I could bring up a big example several years back, a game for the PS2 called State of Emergency.
5196020	5199520	This game was hyped as hell.
5199520	5203840	This is when I knew one of my favorite magazines, Jump the Shark, EGM, I believe they gave the
5203840	5210460	game an 8.5, and it was one of the worst games I've ever played.
5210460	5217260	It started making me think that I think some of those developers pay off magazines to give
5217260	5222620	their games good reviews, and if that is the case, I'm very sorely disappointed in gaming
5222620	5223620	media.
5223620	5225820	Look at Atari and Driver 3, that's what they did.
5225820	5234040	I'm not going to go there because I don't have the proof to back it up, but it's a very
5234040	5240900	interesting industry because you take the passion that movie fans have about movies,
5240900	5244840	go to those big movie websites like Ain't It Cool News, just read the passion that people
5244840	5251900	have for movies, multiply that by 100, and you have the gaming fans and the games.
5251900	5257500	It's something else, and the gaming fans will respond appropriately, I think.
5257500	5259340	I don't think gaming fans are stupid.
5259340	5268060	Look at what happened with All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com, case in point.
5268060	5270900	You could also put the Halo franchise in that same limelight.
5270900	5276820	I don't think that they're 10 out of 10s as what a lot of magazines gave Halo 1 and some
5276820	5278940	gave Halo 2 when it came out.
5278940	5285020	I think they're decent, but they're not industry-changing games.
5285020	5288140	What's funny with that, I would actually disagree, I do think Halo 2 is a 10 out of 10 game,
5288140	5290300	but that's just me.
5290300	5297460	I do think it's an industry-changing game, but that's, again, its opinion.
5297460	5298460	But that's about it.
5298460	5299460	All right.
5299460	5303100	Well, DMN, so you're going to have the guy from VG Cats on your show on Thursday, we
5303100	5304100	hope?
5304100	5306220	Either this or next week, that's what we're shooting for.
5306220	5308100	How are you landing all these big interviews?
5308100	5313220	You just smoothing, writing nice e-mails and all that stuff?
5313220	5316220	How much dick are you having to suck, I guess is what I'm asking.
5316220	5318820	Well, you taught me, so...
5318820	5320620	Oh, okay.
5320620	5325440	Yet I must have taught you better than myself because we're not landing any of these big
5325440	5327140	interviews, but you are, so no.
5327140	5328140	That's cool.
5328140	5329140	We love VG Cats.
5329140	5330140	I'm looking forward to hearing that episode.
5330140	5332180	Tell them that they're my favorite webcomic ever.
5332180	5335900	I'm sure he's going to take the time to point that out.
5335900	5339020	The chick on OLR loves you.
5339020	5343380	All right, DMN.
5343380	5344380	Have a good time.
5344380	5345740	We're going to try to get another call before we leave.
5345740	5346740	All right.
5346740	5347740	Have a good one.
5347740	5348740	Take care, guys.
5348740	5349740	Bye.
5349740	5350740	Bye.
5350740	5357380	If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or the Skype line is Orange Lounge Radio.
5357380	5360660	Let's try at least one more call here, maybe more if we're feeling saucy.
5360660	5363100	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5363100	5364100	Who's this?
5364100	5365100	Raven's Dolphin.
5365100	5366100	Hi, Raven's Dolphin.
5366100	5368220	What's on your mind, buddy?
5368220	5374340	I just want to say that Microsoft did not give early adopters the shaft.
5374340	5375620	They did not give who the shaft?
5375620	5376620	Early adopters.
5376620	5377620	Oh, early adopters.
5377620	5378620	Early adopters.
5378620	5379620	Okay.
5379620	5380620	Why not?
5380620	5385700	Because they did not introduce the HDMI port for the Xbox 360 XS.
5385700	5392180	Oh, so you're saying that you've been following the keynote tonight and they did not, in fact,
5392180	5394020	introduce the HDMI port today?
5394020	5395020	No.
5395020	5396020	No.
5396020	5397020	They didn't.
5397020	5398020	They didn't even say HDMI.
5398020	5401700	They just went like, okay, this is the Xbox 360 IPTV.
5401700	5402700	This is what you can do with it.
5402700	5403700	This is Uno.
5403700	5404700	Now you can play Uno on the road.
5404700	5405700	You can play Uno here.
5405700	5406700	You can play Uno there.
5406700	5409020	You can even play this there.
5409020	5410900	So are you saying this story is bullshit?
5410900	5411900	Oh, yeah.
5411900	5415020	I'm saying it's super bullshit now.
5415020	5417540	I don't know if it's coming later.
5417540	5421260	I'm keeping my mind open to it.
5421260	5422260	You know what?
5422260	5428340	The gadget story in the subsequent YouTube video, pretty daunting evidence.
5428340	5432220	I think there would be a future Xbox that has these add-ons.
5432220	5435980	I think maybe now is just not the time for Microsoft to want to be announcing that.
5435980	5441100	I think they're still trying to move 360s in the wake of a competitive battle with PlayStation
5441100	5442100	3 and Wii.
5442100	5445100	I think maybe now is just not the time they want to announce it, but I think by summer
5445100	5446100	they will.
5446100	5451660	One more thing I want to tell you about that HDMI hookup in the back of the 360.
5451660	5452660	I ran through VGA.
5452660	5456460	They opened it up through VGA through the TV.
5456460	5457460	True.
5457460	5458460	They do.
5458460	5459460	Well, we'll see.
5459460	5460460	We'll see.
5460460	5461460	No.
5461460	5462460	Okay.
5462460	5467340	I just want to say they didn't give me the shot, and I am now trying to get money up
5467340	5468980	for Windows Vista.
5468980	5472060	Well, good luck.
5472060	5473060	I know.
5473060	5474060	You're right.
5474060	5475060	All right.
5475060	5476060	Take care, buddy.
5476060	5477060	You too.
5477060	5478060	Bye.
5478060	5479060	See ya.
5479060	5481620	Boy, some people get through every week, but that's okay.
5481620	5482620	Okay.
5482620	5483620	We do love our regular listeners.
5483620	5484620	One more call.
5484620	5485620	Hi.
5485620	5486620	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
5486620	5487620	Who's this?
5487620	5488620	Hello?
5488620	5489620	Hi.
5489620	5490620	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
5490620	5491620	Who's this?
5491620	5492620	This is DDR Dollar Bill.
5492620	5493620	Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.
5493620	5494620	What's on your mind?
5494620	5495620	Oh, not much.
5495620	5501180	Just trying to call and say hi and what's up, and I do have a question, though.
5501180	5502180	Okay.
5502180	5507980	I haven't heard you guys talk too much about portables, like DS games, except like Cooking
5507980	5509980	Mama.
5509980	5510980	That would be me.
5510980	5511980	Yeah?
5511980	5512980	Yeah.
5512980	5514540	My favorite game, too, by the way.
5514540	5516620	So what were you hoping that we would be talking about?
5516620	5517620	I don't know.
5517620	5521500	It was like, because I just started Hating Guys November, and one of the games I wasn't
5521500	5525780	sure if you guys talked about was in the Castlevania series.
5525780	5529860	You know what's funny is that we got, the last time I actually played the Castlevania
5529860	5533340	game, I do still need to pick up the new one on DS, but we did get to play it in August
5533340	5535740	at the little Konami thing we went to.
5535740	5541740	I really enjoyed it, more than the previous DS games, I get all the names confused.
5541740	5542740	Dawn of Sorrow?
5542740	5543740	Is that it?
5543740	5544740	Dawn of Sorrow?
5544740	5545740	Yeah, Dawn of Sorrow is the last one.
5545740	5546740	And this new one, Portrait of Ruin.
5546740	5547740	Portrait of Ruin I liked quite a bit.
5547740	5551300	I liked the whole fact that you had kind of the two characters, and I liked the fact that
5551300	5553820	you kind of went outside the castle into other worlds.
5553820	5557660	It felt a little more like Simon's Quest, I suppose, in that regard.
5557660	5560140	Or Mario 64, where you jump into the paintings.
5560140	5561140	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5561140	5562760	Kind of like that, yeah.
5562760	5564220	So yeah, no, it was pretty cool.
5564220	5566840	I do want to check out the final release of the game, although I'm pretty sure what we
5566840	5569020	played in August was pretty close to final.
5569020	5574060	Yeah, I've been playing for a while, it's really good.
5574060	5576260	I've never seen a fast...
5576260	5581100	What was the other game we played that Kojima was behind on the DS?
5581100	5582100	Yeah, that hasn't come out yet.
5582100	5583100	I can't remember the name of it.
5583100	5584100	What was that like, Mark?
5584100	5585100	I don't know.
5585100	5586100	Damn it.
5586100	5587100	That was pretty decent.
5587100	5588100	Lunar Nights.
5588100	5589100	Lunar Nights, thank you.
5589100	5590100	That was pretty decent, I liked that.
5590100	5591100	Which one was it?
5591100	5592620	Lunar Nights was pretty fun.
5592620	5595340	It's the sequel to Boktai, I believe.
5595340	5596340	Oh really?
5596340	5597340	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5597340	5601300	It really reminded me of Boktai, but without that stupid chip in the cart, you don't actually
5601300	5604300	have to be out in the sun, which did not work for me on the advance.
5604300	5606600	I'm going to take a shot.
5606600	5609880	And I've been sinking a lot of hours lately into Elite Beat Agents, which I think I've
5609880	5614860	been showering love and adoration on on this program, and Final Fantasy III on the DS.
5614860	5616300	You know what I'm excited about?
5616300	5619500	The Warriors is coming out on the PSP at the end of the month.
5619500	5623700	And I was going to say, PSP-wise, I don't know if you're gaming on that, but some games
5623700	5626380	I've said previously to check out.
5626380	5631300	Luminous 2, very good if you haven't played Luminous on live, or especially the first
5631300	5632300	one.
5632300	5633500	Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.
5633500	5637140	The Gradius Collection and those other retro titles are great.
5637140	5644900	Was it the Twinvee Collection, which is coming out, and the Salamander Collection, and of
5644900	5651780	course, for Game Boy Advance Final Fantasy VI, first week in February there, Diddy Kong
5651780	5654100	Racing for the DS.
5654100	5657340	We love our handhelds, it's just the past couple months have been mostly the systems
5657340	5658340	for me.
5658340	5659340	The consoles, I should say.
5659340	5665620	Yeah, just, hmm, Warriors on the PSP, I hope it plays like the Xbox and PS2 versions.
5665620	5667180	Oh, we'll see.
5667180	5672060	Yeah, I hope so, because I tried Luminous, but you said, and on the phone, actually.
5672060	5673060	Oh.
5673060	5674060	On the cell phone.
5674060	5678140	I couldn't really hear the music, but the gameplay was actually addicting.
5678140	5683340	Yeah, I mean, remember that on an actual system it's gonna look so much better, and yeah,
5683340	5686180	if you thought the gameplay was addicting on the phone, wait till you play it.
5686180	5688100	I think Luminous is a fantastic game.
5688100	5693020	I didn't put Luminous 2 in my top 10 of the year, because unfortunately I felt it didn't
5693020	5699220	really add enough, especially when you consider the mobile really took some risks with the
5699220	5700220	gameplay.
5700220	5704260	I felt that Luminous 2 was a little too much more of the same for it to be justified on
5704260	5707860	the top 10 of the year, but it definitely was a very solid release, and if you have
5707860	5712860	not played Luminous at all, then it's okay to skip Luminous 1 and go right to 2, because
5712860	5718300	it does have some added things, and I think the additional skins in the music videos were
5718300	5719300	very cool.
5719300	5721380	Oh, that was the other reason why Luminous 2 lost a lot of brownie points with me, is
5721380	5724220	because they recycled way too much for Luminous 1.
5724220	5728980	So pretty much Luminous 2 is like Luminous 1 plus Unstuffed, then?
5728980	5734540	Yeah, but way more stuff, and if you don't have a PSP at all, you should get the Xbox
5734540	5738980	Live one, but I don't think you need both, unless you're really a puzzle game whore like
5738980	5739980	I am.
5739980	5744780	Well, not as much for me, but the 360 I'll get later.
5744780	5751140	I'm eagerly hoping that the music artist pack and the Heavenly Stars song is out very, very
5751140	5752140	soon.
5752140	5754140	It was supposed to be in January at some point, so we'll see.
5754140	5760180	Yeah, it'll be a while for me to get it, because of money and all that.
5760180	5764300	Any other thoughts for our listeners, DDR dollar bill?
5764300	5768380	I had a few, but I'm just still a little sick right now, so I just wanted to chime in about
5768380	5771720	the portables, because I never hear you guys talk about it.
5771720	5774220	We try to give it a little love once in a while, we do love our portables, I love my
5774220	5777540	DS, and my PSP for certain things.
5777540	5778540	Same here.
5778540	5779540	All right.
5779540	5780540	Well, thanks so much for the call, buddy.
5780540	5781540	Keep listening.
5781540	5782540	See you, guys.
5782540	5783540	All right, see you.
5783540	5784540	Bye-bye.
5784540	5785540	Bye-bye.
5785540	5788780	Ah, those were some good calls tonight.
5788780	5791340	Little rough starts to some of them, but we got our way through them.
5791340	5794260	So thank you guys so much for calling in tonight, we're going to go ahead and close the Skype
5794260	5795260	line.
5795260	5799020	Sorry to those that didn't get through, but we still love you, we're almost to two hours
5799020	5800960	for this segment, so we've got to wrap this crap up.
5800960	5802500	Any last minute stories, you guys?
5802500	5803500	Yes.
5803500	5804500	Okay.
5804500	5810020	Necronasia is coming to the United States as a game called Escape from Bug Island, and
5810020	5812580	let me tell you this much, the game is as crappy as that new title.
5812580	5817180	So don't pick it up when it comes out, it's shit.
5817180	5821700	But Eidos is producing it, so that won't be the first time that their games suck.
5821700	5822700	Let's see here.
5822700	5828260	Then, of course, there was some news also coming from CES about Vista, and this isn't
5828260	5833340	really a huge surprise, that the Xbox 360 controller is going to be able to be used
5833340	5834340	with Vista.
5834340	5840940	In fact, it's going to be kind of like a standard for them, so, duh, big, huge surprise there.
5840940	5845500	What is kind of cool, though, is this Thursday, January 11th, there's going to be new content
5845500	5852220	for Gears of War coming out, including two free maps, Raven Down, which is going to be
5852220	5860020	a map set around a downed Raven helicopter, and it looks pretty, and there's also a new
5860020	5865820	map called Old Bones, which looks like a museum, which looks pretty cool.
5865820	5870140	Both those are going to be free because they're being sponsored by, and this is weird, the
5870140	5872020	Discovery Channel.
5872020	5875420	They're also giving away two million Microsoft points.
5875420	5879100	Doesn't Discovery HD, though, have a game special that's been airing or something?
5879100	5880100	I don't know.
5880100	5881100	I think so.
5881100	5882100	It makes a little sense to me.
5882100	5885180	So that's kind of cool, I guess.
5885180	5886540	Pretty cool.
5886540	5890780	And also there's a rumor that Nintendo is developing a wireless nunchuck already.
5890780	5891780	Interesting.
5891780	5895900	They need a wireless old school controller, a classic controller.
5895900	5896900	Classic controller.
5896900	5899260	Well, if they do the nunchuck, they can do the classic controller, I guess.
5899260	5900260	They will.
5900260	5903540	Dark Saga, do you have anything?
5903540	5904540	No.
5904540	5905540	All right.
5905540	5907380	Then that brings our show to a close.
5907380	5911100	Thanks again so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio, you guys.
5911100	5913260	Just a reminder, we're not live next week.
5913260	5917420	I'm sorry, live listeners, but we just have personal situations to be dealt with, and
5917420	5921460	that would include I'm finally going to Disneyland with the girls, so we'll take lots of pictures
5921460	5927300	and share that with you guys in the fan communities, and Loki has that other thing, which I'm just
5927300	5931340	now finding out about, and I really wish I could go to that, so please give those two,
5931340	5936620	my old Final Fantasy XI buddies, give them my best, and best wishes and all that stuff.
5936620	5941020	And we will still have a new audio blog or podcast, whatever you want to call it.
5941020	5944020	There will still be a new show that way, so apologies to live listeners.
5944020	5948180	I know you've had to deal with a break, but we promise after this week, we won't be having
5948180	5953440	a break for a long time, a long time, so if you bear with us, we'll be good.
5953440	5956220	So thank you guys so much for your continued support of our program.
5956220	5960780	You guys are awesome, and we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
5960780	5962500	Loki, your final thought.
5962500	5967620	My final thought is there's this laser pen advertisement on this one page here, and it's
5967620	5970260	cool because it shoots a giant laser.
5970260	5972740	I want a laser.
5972740	5973740	Lasers are awesome.
5973740	5977100	I guess it's shiny.
5977100	5981100	Dark Sakura, your final thought.
5981100	5989260	I really, really, really, really, really am tired of drinking my own medicinal tea to
5989260	5996820	make my throat work, and I want to cook something, but not right now.
5996820	5998540	I want to cook for real.
5998540	5999540	Bake me a pie.
5999540	6001020	I'll bake Shepherd's pie.
6001020	6003220	I'll make good Shepherd's pie.
6003220	6007580	My final thought is that Legend of Zaku says this, yay, that means you OLR listeners must
6007580	6010420	watch 24 next Sunday in the show's absence.
6010420	6015860	I would actually support that because 24 is a show I need to get back into that's really
6015860	6018140	good, and I'm going to TiVo it while we're gone.
6018140	6020340	People should look for us at Disneyland if they're going to be there.
6020340	6021340	Yeah, say hi.
6021340	6022340	You can't miss us.
6022340	6025760	If you've seen the little picture in the album art, you can't miss us.
6025760	6029660	We haven't changed much, although we do have new pictures coming, and I'm going to be working
6029660	6031820	extra-super-duper hard on a new website this week.
6031820	6033900	I'm very excited, and you'll see more about that.
6033900	6037020	Hopefully in two weeks we'll be able to launch it by the end of the month.
6037020	6038020	I'm very excited.
6038020	6039020	Rock on.
6039020	6042220	And the Orange Launch Radio 07, baby.
6042220	6044540	Speaking of those lasers, they're like two grand.
6044540	6046340	Fuck that shit for a laser pointer.
6046340	6047340	But they bridge.
6047340	6048340	I have a laser pointer.
6048340	6054420	You can cut shit with them though, so that's awesome.
6054420	6057260	You can literally burn out someone's retinas with that.
6057260	6059920	All right, well thank you guys again.
6059920	6060920	We can't thank you enough.
6060920	6062860	It's your support that keeps us going.
6062860	6063860	You guys are awesome.
6063860	6066700	Orange Launch Radio is for you guys.
6066700	6067700	Have a great week.
6067700	6071220	We'll see you next week with a new podcast here on Orange Launch Radio.
