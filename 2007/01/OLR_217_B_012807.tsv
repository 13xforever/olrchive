487	5570	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5890	14754	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15454	19136	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20077	21978	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
22038	27340	We are here on this lovely Sunday evening, January the 28th of 2007 for more of Orange Lounge Radio.
27760	28821	And we're going to get into part B.
30020	36183	My throat is feeling a little bit better, but I'm going to step out of the room for just a second to get some coffee out of my Hello Kitty coffee maker.
36243	40065	For those who didn't listen to Part A, my throat's kind of bad tonight.
40085	45287	So I'm going to go get some more hot stuff to drink, and can you guys take care of some gaming news for a minute?
45487	45887	Why not?
46027	47108	I would really appreciate that.
47468	47768	All right.
47988	56612	Anyways, so starting things off, this week Microsoft had announced their earnings for their quarter, and of course...
58125	61227	The profits were down, but at least the 360 revenues were up.
61587	77276	Well, unfortunately, Microsoft went back and revised their earnings statements, basically saying that their expected 360 shipments for 2007 and spring, they reduced it down from $15 million to $12 million.
78036	80498	This is due to unsold inventories in stores.
80578	86601	So basically, you know, that big tower of 360s that you see in your Best Buys and your Game Stops,
87580	94685	Well, because of that, they are dropping their shipments amount because, you know, who needs to ship more units if there's tons in stores?
96186	103030	Anyways, and because of that, all these stocks from other companies have dropped a little bit as well because of that news.
103170	105412	So it's not a big, you know, big surprise.
105432	113898	I mean, the PlayStation 3 is kind of in the same boat right now where they have a ton of units in stores and no one's really buying them because there's not a lot of games out right now or it's too expensive.
114618	114978	Either way...
116394	124218	One of the analysts, PJ McNeely, said video game publishers will be under pressure today after Microsoft cuts its life-to-date shipment.
126459	133083	There is investor concern about reset of expectations around both the Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation 3.
133743	138105	So pretty much just, you know, I guess they're playing it safe.
139886	140427	I missed all that.
140467	141027	Could you repeat it?
142634	142794	No.
143394	152477	It's basically Microsoft shipping or they're reducing their amount of shipments that they're going to be... No, I heard Microsoft's goal went down a little bit.
153217	155218	And I can see the impact that's having on things as a whole.
156118	159019	It's only down to me a few million, I guess.
159059	162860	That's kind of bad, but they just have to sell the units that they have right now.
162920	166521	And trust me, those units will be gone once Halo 3 comes out.
166981	168322	And even maybe Crackdown.
168342	171503	I mean, Crackdown might sell a few... I don't know about selling units for beta, but
174946	179928	All right, well, this is a report coming from QJ.net, speaking of the Xbox 360.
179968	181068	This is a little bit of a hack.
181708	190730	You can use this at your own risk, but apparently a hack has been released, the HDD hacker, that will allow you to use your hard drive, your own hard drive, with the Xbox 360.
191870	193511	Now, keep in mind there are some limitations.
193551	199772	You can only really use a Western Digital BEVS series and only a 20-gigabyte hard drive.
200137	208760	But keep in mind, if you do it that way, a 20GB hard drive through Western Digital is going to be a hell of a lot cheaper than a regular Xbox 360 hard drive through Microsoft.
209700	212041	But, you know, I'm thinking... Actually, I'm sorry.
212081	217422	The site goes on to say that once bigger Microsoft-certified hard drives come out, then you'll be able to use those with the tool.
217702	219143	But I'm thinking, no, you won't.
219223	221764	Microsoft's very good about patching this shit as soon as they find it.
221844	226565	And I bet you by this time next week, we'll see a patch roll out on live that'll prevent this.
227225	229386	The next patch that goes out live will shut this thing out.
229566	229666	No.
231006	241831	The reason why this does is actually there's information on the hard drive sector that's the same on all the hard drives because they have to be universal since they're working with all these different systems.
242631	249594	It's basically some sort of identified device type of thing that's stored in one of the sectors.
250014	253195	So all they do is basically mimic that on this hard drive.
253255	256657	So all it thinks is that it's a legit hard drive.
257197	259598	So there would be no way to patch this.
260445	261345	because it's a peripheral.
261365	268426	It'd be like if I took a controller for the 360 and I made it look like that's an official Microsoft controller.
268446	272207	There's no way for it to tell between whether this is real or not.
273287	279248	Alright, well you follow the hack stuff more than I do, so I'll take your word for it, but this just seems like the kind of thing that Microsoft's usually all over.
279588	280749	But I'll take your word for it.
280869	284729	It's not like modifying firmware or anything like that, so I think that they wouldn't be able to patch this.
286910	287590	We'll see what happens.
288110	288290	Well,
289671	297456	Going into things that have, well, I don't know, not quite yet having to do with the Xbox 360.
297917	298677	Well, sort of.
298777	299018	Okay.
299638	300819	Let me just rephrase this.
302320	307303	We're all familiar with the Unreal Engine, right?
308304	308464	Yeah.
308484	308664	Sure.
308804	310145	There's been some good games coming out of that.
310525	312347	Well, guess who's just licensed it?
313708	315029	It's been licensed by Squeenix.
316169	316470	Really?
316930	317070	Yep.
318907	325710	They're basically, there's a manager, I'm all tongue tied now, thank you, I blame you.
326271	340159	There's a statement put out by the general manager of R&D at Square Enix that's Taku Murata saying that it will speed up the creation process and allow developers to spend
340680	342621	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
366579	367220	Maybe.
367540	368220	I like this thought.
368260	371043	Drew Nami says, Kingdom Hearts 3 using the Unreal Engine.
371183	371964	Wouldn't that be hot?
372484	373765	I have a boner just thinking about it.
374265	375346	Just kidding, just kidding.
375927	376928	Still, that's pretty exciting.
377288	378269	The Unreal Engine's pretty good.
378309	383693	There's actually a little bit more information regarding the Unreal Tournament itself.
384294	389958	Unreal Tournament 2007 is now renamed as Unreal Tournament 3 and is going to be on Xbox 360.
391339	394342	It was confirmed at Midway's Gamers Day in Las Vegas.
395303	395383	Um...
396661	401425	It's going to be developed with the PC and PS3 versions.
402426	403927	It has a release later on this year.
407030	407390	I don't know.
408431	408871	It's Unreal.
409712	411273	You know one thing I do like about Unreal?
411313	415416	I haven't played a whole lot of it, but I did play it on the original Xbox because I bought it when it was like $20.
416277	417538	It's fucking fast.
417738	419960	It is like one of the fastest shooters I've ever played.
420000	421461	It's amazingly fast.
421481	421942	I like it.
422282	424524	Even just the first Unreal tournament was crazy.
425604	427865	That was a game that gave me some freaking motion sickness right there.
427885	431707	Yeah, I was going to say, you probably are not having much fun with those games with how fast they move.
431767	437089	Well, there's also a little bit more as far as, not necessarily just the graphics, but different multiplayer modes.
438050	443852	There is a voice-controlled AI and player-controlled vehicles.
444392	452916	There's also a conquest mode that will be a battle for eight teams on a map that's three times the size of the Deathmatch and Onslaught maps.
454697	455017	Anyways.
456363	468854	Speaking about Square Enix here, NCSX has reported that Square Enix is going to be producing a collection of replica weapons called the Square Enix Master Arms Collection.
470035	475019	It's basically going to be some of the weapons from the Final Fantasy series and Keyblade from Kingdom Hearts.
476012	479713	Unfortunately, they are not going to be full-size, so don't get your hopes up there.
480173	489454	But they're going to range from 15 centimeters for Cerebus to 26 centimeters for Sephiroth's Gunblade.
490715	493735	Right now, there's four different blades to choose from.
493755	498896	Let's see, Cerebus, which I believe, I can't remember which Final Fantasy it is from.
500936	502517	The Keyblade, of course, from Kingdom Hearts.
502857	503697	Squall's Gunblade.
503717	504957	I believe that's Vincent's Gun.
505370	505650	DarkSakura
535060	536703	Maybe, I have school to pay for
546158	547599	Oh, did it already go up?
547659	548780	It already went up.
572205	573546	I don't have a Playstation 3 so I don't know.
573846	583791	But apparently it went up and they did this whole little change there is that the Playstation 1 and 2 games now will run right and they'll look fine.
584651	593575	And now you can also, they also did some other little things like you can set an image photo for a user ID and all this other little minor crap Korean keyboards and stuff you can use now.
593595	595296	You know what's weird though?
596237	600398	You know on your PSP how during the months they'll change colors in the background?
600819	601239	Well they...
601957	606958	PS3 backgrounds will slowly fade from one color to another as time goes on through the month.
607158	609638	It might start off black, and now it's yellow.
610278	610899	It's kind of weird.
611259	611859	Ew, yellow?
612419	612679	Yeah.
613339	614239	Not my favorite color.
615979	619740	Well, actually, you know, yellow is associated with aggression, so it's not my favorite either.
622160	628522	But there's actually, though, a little bit more news coming out regarding an animated Castlevania 3 movie.
629062	631362	Yeah, the Dracula's Curse movie.
633814	639596	They're basically looking, they're still in the early stages of their production.
639756	642818	They're working on the visual development side of everything.
644558	647980	So through February it's going to be mostly character creature design.
648000	649941	They need background designers, background painters.
650721	655203	They're actually looking for artists to work with that.
655243	658024	So they've actually opened up positions in Southern California.
659625	661506	If you actually want to submit
662673	669217	Your portfolio to them, you can actually email at Belmont at CastlevaniaDraculasCursed.com I think that's pretty cool.
669237	671758	They're looking for artists.
672238	672939	Give us some work.
674139	676741	I'd like to see that when it comes out.
676961	686526	Well, unfortunately, there have been some other bad vampire movies, including Blood Rain, which is up for six Razzies.
688015	699198	It's received nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Supporting Actor, Worst Supporting Actress, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay.
699718	706280	So that's, I guess, good news if you really hate BloodRayne.
707600	711661	Although if you do hate BloodRayne, you would probably be disappointed to know that he's planning a sequel.
712661	715082	And it's, I think, already in production, so that kind of sucks.
715969	719691	One other movie that he has coming out, though, pretty soon is going to be Postal.
720052	730838	And IGN had some news from that, actually, talking about some of the things that are going to be offending people, including such wonderful things as full-frontal nudity from NewsRadio's Dave Foley.
731719	734961	Apparently, he's going to be playing some crazy cult leader.
736341	738222	And there's one scene... Hooray?
738242	743806	I mean, I realize you guys know I'm gay and all, but I'm not thrilled to hear about that.
743866	744086	I mean...
745514	746315	He's kind of old.
746615	756339	Anyways, Dave Foley's character in the production is called Uncle Dave and is a twisted cult leader who uses his religious doctrine to keep his subjects in a constant state of servitude.
757000	763743	And he exploits this by luring them into orgies and other debauchery.
764123	770766	It says in the scenes that they saw, Foley was dressed in an open robe, and they mean open, wandering around the room barking orders.
770806	773287	And at the end of the scene, he takes a crap on camera.
774184	775065	That's the kind of movie.
775125	777506	What?
777626	779607	Other fun stuff about this movie, though.
779667	780568	Oh, my God.
780628	784870	Talk about your career going downhill after news radio going off.
784930	785991	That's got to be made up.
786451	787792	Nope.
787892	793395	Other stuff that they have in the movie, it says there's stuff about 9-11.
793435	796277	They actually make fun of 9-11.
796317	801580	They make fun of school shootings, including, I guess there was one scene that says...
802583	805524	This sounds like the dumbest fucking thing in the world.
805544	806184	I mean, seriously.
806204	812027	There's a difference between parody that's somewhat amusing and this just sounds like stupid after stupid after stupid.
812067	812307	Yeah, so...
833211	834512	It should be interesting, I guess.
835592	835913	Okay.
836333	838054	Interesting's a good word to define it, I suppose.
838074	838594	I'll see it, though.
838995	839995	I will definitely go see it.
840075	840596	Oh, God.
841016	841516	Have fun.
842176	842737	By yourself.
843517	844678	Unless you can talk Nellie into going.
846075	850538	All right, well, one thing we didn't go over in Part A were the release dates.
850598	853900	Even though Loki gave us some exclusives, we didn't talk about what's coming out this week.
853980	858162	So I want to start it off talking about Japanese release dates, of which, honestly, folks, there's not a whole lot.
858903	865207	January was a dry month for us over here in the U.S., and February, at least the beginning part of it, looks to be a bit slow over there in Japan.
865947	870810	We do have J-League Pro Soccer Club Otsukuru 5 coming out.
871320	872261	on February 1st.
872421	879004	Also, Zero Shikikan Josentukeni, which is Best Hits from Taito.
879384	881606	And I'm not sure if that's a game that's actually out over here.
881626	886849	It looks like some type of old school B-52 type bomber game.
887809	889210	I don't think this is a game they have over here.
891191	892271	Twin Cobra?
892552	893212	I don't think so.
895713	896214	I don't remember.
896234	896814	Where's the title?
897755	904259	Zero, Shikikan, Josentokini Yeah, whatever.
904800	906021	It's just the best hits anyway.
906061	906681	It's already out.
906701	908482	It's just going in to be a little bit cheaper.
909323	910463	And let's see.
910523	912325	What do we have over on the Nintendo DS?
912365	913986	We do have a couple things coming out on the DS.
914026	925113	We have Monster House, which I suppose is a release a lot of folks are looking forward to, as well as Bokujo Monogatari Kimi to Sodatsu Shima coming out from Marvelous Entertainment.
925512	926113	Nappishitam no Hakko
944719	947484	Arthur and the Invisibles for PS2, DS, PC, Game Boy Advance
957182	981396	Contact on DS, also Dungeon Siege, Throne of Agony on PSP, Europa Universalis 3 on PC, Ghost Rider on Xbox, NFL Street 3 going to be on PSP and PlayStation 2, Sega Genesis Collection, PS2, PSP, and on the 5th Galactic Civilizations 2, but that's coming out later.
983015	985837	Dragon Quest VIII Battle Stations Midway PC, Vanguard Saga of Heroes
1012888	1030999	and, um, let's see here, Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation 3, uh, Fusion, I don't know, Fusion Frenzy 2 on Xbox 360, uh, City Life World Edition on the PC, and Monopoly Here and Now on the PC.
1031560	1035262	So, um, that's about it for this week at least.
1036423	1041025	Alright, well, uh, I wanted to mention this, and, uh, this is a little bit embarrassing because the, uh, oh, no, there it is.
1041366	1041846	Good, we got it.
1042281	1044221	The link wasn't working previously for some reason.
1044241	1050062	I was trying to hit Blizzard Entertainment to look at this press release that talks about World of Warcraft, The Burning Crusade.
1050162	1052683	Of course, you know that that game just came out earlier this month.
1052703	1053343	Well, get this.
1053943	1059604	It sold 2.4 million copies in the first 24 hours.
1059984	1064085	It was released simultaneously in North America, Europe, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia.
1064545	1068425	And then January 17th, Australia and New Zealand, just the day after.
1069166	1071266	Which actually would, because they're on the other side of the dateline.
1071306	1071726	But never mind.
1072328	1076272	Regardless, they came out and sold 2.4 million copies in 24 hours.
1077093	1082838	That's pretty impressive and certainly shattered any existing PC game records that were already out there.
1083939	1086481	Lots of World of Warcraft addicts out there in the world, apparently.
1087342	1089143	Are they ignoring their babies?
1089684	1090625	I don't know.
1090925	1095409	For those that only listen to us during the podcast, we have a bonus segment we do here live.
1096051	1096792	Mike Moore-Hamey
1115071	1116551	I still have not bought the expansion.
1116591	1117872	I won't be buying it until I hit level 40.
1117912	1119232	That's what I promised myself.
1119272	1119372	Well...
1136849	1141934	There are, I think, other MMOs that might be pulling people's addiction.
1142594	1145297	There's a Lord of the Rings MMO actually has a date.
1146017	1154585	It's a Lord of the Rings Shadow of Angmar to be released in Europe on the 24th of April, according to Codemasters.
1157047	1161111	The price of it actually is going to be a special pre-order rate.
1162058	1167262	for $99.99 that has a lifetime membership instead of a subscription fee.
1168103	1171766	So you can either do that or pay £5.99 a month for a six month package.
1178711	1207641	but the advantage of pre-ordering it gives you early access to the game for 10 days you can use a pre-launch character in the full game so basically whatever you make during this little beta is yours to hold on to you get a unique in-game bonus item six Lord of the Rings online stickers and a special window sticker yeah it seems kind of interesting I don't know it's
1208470	1210171	There's so many MMOs out there, really.
1210891	1211452	Amen!
1237584	1245328	Also though, just to let you know, I'm on the US site for this Lord of the Rings game.
1246428	1256453	For the pre-order special that they're having on that one, I'm trying to scroll down on it, it's still loading.
1256473	1258254	Let me read a couple of comments.
1259675	1261816	When you pre-order it, you have $199 for the lifetime thing, or $999 monthly.
1264815	1267176	Early Access, you keep your launch care.
1267236	1268356	It's the same thing, really.
1268396	1272957	You get an enchanted Cloak of Regeneration and a Ring of Agility.
1274278	1275798	I like regenerating.
1277999	1279699	I had to read some of these other interesting comments.
1279999	1285381	SSJ100Matt says, Dear Blizzard, since you have all this money, you wouldn't mind putting StarCraft on DS, would you?
1286661	1291042	And Michael Doy is going to make a fan with Jamie here saying, I want a Doctor Who MMO.
1291442	1292103	Hell yeah!
1292983	1293623	I saw that coming.
1295410	1296891	I might sign up for the beta for this, though.
1298011	1302753	Anyways, so before Doctor Who MMO, you're going to see something else coming from BBC.
1303194	1307075	That would be CBBC, their kids' property.
1307456	1311117	They're going to be creating an MMO based on that called CBBC World.
1311818	1323003	It's going to be aimed at kids ages 7 to 12, and it's going to kind of just be your online MMO for kids, just like Toontown, Disney thing over here.
1325506	1331530	Yeah, it's gonna have a bunch of, like, you know, custom avatars, you know, minigames, music videos.
1333492	1337975	Completely lame for anybody over the age of 12, but Jamie will still be signed up to play.
1337995	1343499	No, it's gonna be, like, what, Gaia Online or something, which I quit in, you know, a day, because it was boring.
1343639	1351786	You'll still play it, because, like, if it's BBC related, it might remotely have a Doctor Who reference in it, and you'll be like... If someone tells me for sure there's a Doctor Who reference, I'll sign up.
1351826	1352466	See, see.
1352806	1353627	Chat room, lie to her.
1353667	1354187	It'll be funny.
1354808	1354888	Um...
1355672	1359314	But I only want our UK listeners to tell me.
1359554	1360094	Alright, fine.
1360774	1365957	I was going to say, on a completely unrelated note, that doesn't even have to do with video games, but I think it's kind of funny regarding the BBC.
1366097	1374360	I read on some reality TV news site, don't ask me what I was doing reading it, but I was, that the BBC is doing like a Harry Potter reality show.
1374440	1378062	It's not called Harry Potter, but they're sending kids to magic school.
1378903	1383125	and it's going to be like a reality show for kids in magic school and they actually have to do magic tricks.
1383446	1384326	No, it's magic school.
1384626	1385367	You mean devil school?
1385387	1386307	Yeah, I get it, I get it.
1386327	1386987	I see what you did there.
1387288	1389129	But no, it sounds really cheesy.
1390549	1393891	But I hope they bring the show over to America because it would be a hoot.
1394471	1395172	Magic school.
1395192	1397133	Because they get a lot of shows from Britain over here.
1397313	1401715	And it should be hosted by David Copperfield because he's washed up anyway.
1401735	1403616	What the hell ever happened to David Copperfield?
1403636	1404437	He just disappeared.
1405157	1406438	He just made himself disappear.
1407130	1413516	Well, one game that disappeared but made a hell of a comeback moving into some non-MMO PC gaming news, Sam & Max.
1413876	1416378	You know, they were gone for a long, long time, and then they came back.
1416418	1420862	They're getting new life thanks to GameTap and, you know, some of the other distribution methods they're doing.
1421442	1425946	Episode 1, Culture Shock for Sam & Max came out in October of 06.
1426026	1432732	Episode 2 came out December of 06, and now Episode 3 just came out on GameTap just this past week.
1432792	1434874	It's titled The Mole, The Mob, and The Meatball.
1435379	1438180	It's going to be the third part of a six-part series.
1438720	1441041	From what I understand, I have yet to play these games myself.
1441081	1441641	I really need to.
1441681	1442882	I have a GameTap subscription.
1442902	1444662	I need to put down the WoW and get into these games.
1444962	1448023	From what I understand, none of these episodes are really long.
1448203	1452825	Maybe you'll play them for four hours, depending on how much you play.
1453725	1455906	If you have to explore every nook and cranny or not.
1457867	1459167	But it sounds kind of interesting.
1459347	1463969	You often hear about these episodic gaming, but...
1464915	1467017	They kind of produce one or two episodes, then that's it.
1467177	1470740	So it's kind of nice to see Sam and Max keep going at it and being very successful.
1471080	1472681	And I've heard nothing but raves about the game.
1472721	1481168	So I promise you I will play Sam and Max at least part one, maybe all the way through part three, depending on how I enjoy it, before the month's over, which doesn't give me much time.
1482068	1485611	Hopefully that series will run a little longer than the cartoon series that they had.
1486472	1488834	But you can see the cartoon series on GameTap, for whatever it's worth.
1488894	1489174	Oh, cool.
1490035	1490295	Well...
1491838	1496121	For our PC gamers, there's a bit of sad news.
1497062	1500264	Age of Conan has been delayed even longer.
1500404	1502466	It will be out in October.
1502766	1504487	It actually will ship October 30th.
1505668	1510531	Xbox 360 version is going to be in 2008, so it'll be after that.
1513934	1515194	It looks interesting.
1516355	1518457	It looks pretty, I guess.
1519429	1521571	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1540934	1541774	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1564078	1567540	What the fuck did that have to do with anything we were just talking about?
1567660	1571062	I saw an ad for a Tycoon game and I was thinking PC stuff.
1572202	1573143	I think that'd be awesome.
1574123	1575985	There could be some major money made there.
1577045	1578206	And then it should come out in the DS.
1581968	1583389	Any more curveballs you want to throw at us?
1583629	1586931	Well, if, you know, you're not into porn Tycoon or, you know,
1588214	1588875	Age of Conan.
1589335	1592718	You might be interested in Ghost Recon Advanced Warfare 2 for the PC.
1593118	1597922	It's going to be coming out day and date with the Xbox 360 version which is March 9th.
1598882	1609691	It's going to feature some more multiplayer stuff as well as up to 32 players online and more game modes including the standard deathmatch co-op and stuff.
1609831	1611792	Plus it's just going to have a whole new storyline.
1611812	1616536	To be honest the game looked originally kind of like the first one a lot but
1617242	1629726	The storyline sounds pretty interesting, almost like they're going to do, I want to say there's like Mexicans invading Texas or something, and some sort of, like they have to stave off some civil war over Mexico and stuff.
1629746	1632187	I don't know, it was a fun game the first time around.
1632447	1634468	I cheated the whole way through it, by the way.
1635549	1635969	Surprise.
1636169	1636809	It was fun, though.
1637512	1639572	Infinite grenade launchers are awesome.
1639932	1644613	See, I knew you and your random porn tycoon outburst would stir chat.
1644693	1645774	What's going on in our chat room?
1646334	1650034	TheRobD says, Loki just had his what if it snowed in San Francisco moment.
1650855	1652435	Meklar says, porn tycoon.
1652495	1653955	First off, build a fluffer room.
1654735	1656896	Because the fluffers are an important part of pornography.
1657716	1660536	And then DarkTetsuya says, I thought they made that.
1660576	1661937	It was called Playboy Mansion.
1662477	1663637	No, Playboy Mansion was lame.
1665134	1667856	How would you improve on Playboy Mansion for Porn Tycoon?
1668516	1670117	Actually make it cool and not Playboy.
1670137	1672718	Because Playboy, to be honest, just sucks.
1672998	1676040	They just want to be X-rated, but they're too classy for that shit.
1676120	1682103	So, you know, if it was like, you know, Penthouse Mansion or something like that, that'd be a little step in the right direction there.
1682584	1684885	Joshi16 says, Neverland Ranch Tycoon.
1685005	1685805	One person buys it.
1685865	1686246	Guess who?
1689407	1689928	Peter Pan?
1692929	1693870	Alright, well, um...
1694744	1695324	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1718260	1720302	So, have you guys seen this list already?
1720482	1722123	Loki, Jamie, have you guys seen the list already?
1722283	1722504	Yeah.
1722664	1724385	Okay, Loki, Jamie, have you read this list already?
1724926	1726787	Okay, what would you think would be on this list?
1726827	1728749	Besides Tomb Raider, which is up on the screen right now.
1729129	1734374	What games do you think, number 7 is Tomb Raider, what series do you think have just been run into the ground?
1735575	1736956	Remakes of Final Fantasy 7.
1737637	1739218	Okay, well let's see if it shows up.
1739238	1742421	Alright, number 7 is Tomb Raider.
1742521	1743862	Number 6 is Mega Man.
1744557	1750441	because, I mean, really, I mean, there's been all those stinking Battle Network games, but there was, you know, there was never really a Mega Man 9.
1751262	1756325	Mega Man X games kind of ended in 2004, and so, you know, Mega Man's just kind of been done to death.
1756805	1758486	They need a resurgence of Mega Man, I think.
1759007	1761849	Beautiful Joe is at number five, which I think is an interesting selection.
1761869	1764070	They had, like, two or three games for that series.
1764110	1765191	That's hardly running for the game.
1765211	1766512	But were any of them as good as the first one?
1766912	1770855	But they, you know, to be honest, though, they may have not been as good as the first one, but...
1771537	1775661	It's like, you have to kind of take off to run it into the ground, you know what I mean?
1775801	1779143	GamesRadar cites Red Hot Rumble, which was a Smash Bros.
1779203	1783147	type fighter game that had beautiful Joe characters in it.
1783227	1784988	Number four was Dynasty Warriors.
1785949	1789132	Every single Dynasty Warriors game is exactly the same as the one before it.
1789452	1794056	And then they keep doing this fucking Empire shit, which is exactly the same game all over again.
1794616	1800321	Number three is Tenchu, and they cite the PSP version, as this has just been done too much now.
1801275	1801755	Who cares?
1801816	1804137	I mean, that game, there's still not that many games.
1804618	1805999	Number two is Spy Hunter.
1806279	1806859	I agree with this.
1806879	1808961	There's been like three games in that series.
1809261	1812423	But seriously, it was gone for the longest time.
1812463	1820609	You had Spy Hunter and then a forgettable sequel in the arcades, and then it was gone forever, and then suddenly Midway decided to make this resurgence out of it, and it's not been anything to scream about.
1821490	1821710	Right?
1822691	1823011	Okay.
1823812	1825433	Well, that's why they say they run into the ground.
1825713	1829536	They cite Spy Hunter 2 and Spy Hunter Nowhere to Run.
1831472	1859578	3 games by 3 different developers the number 1 series they say has been run into the ground Sonic the Hedgehog the number 1 series and of course they cite the GBA port of the original that was god awful in 2006 Rivals and Riders which weren't that great of course this new one that's god awful they say the last truly good Sonic game according to GamesRadar Sonic Rush back in 2005 was the last good one you know what I think is interesting though
1861184	1866168	I know a lot of folks out there think we're Nintendo fanboys and girls here on this program, and to some extent, you know, we are a little bit.
1866828	1870031	But hasn't Mario had some pretty shitty games, too?
1870451	1870711	Yeah.
1870771	1872392	Did you ever play Mario is Missing?
1873373	1874454	That was a PC game, though.
1874934	1877516	No, there was a version on Super Nintendo that was pretty awful.
1877596	1879738	Luigi's Mansion, not that great.
1880278	1882100	A lot of people didn't like Mario Sunshine.
1882360	1886043	I thought it was pretty good myself, but a lot of folks didn't like it for whatever reason.
1886423	1887424	And the re-release over and over.
1887664	1889565	Why is Mario getting a buy out of all this?
1889785	1890266	I mean, I guess...
1890998	1891358	Mario 64, Donkey Kong
1907677	1909759	Oh, that Mario vs. Donkey Kong.
1909799	1910740	Well, those games are okay.
1910780	1912342	No, I meant, like, just Donkey Kong stuff.
1912362	1914824	I mean, the Donkey Kong Country... Donkey Kong Country got ran into the ground.
1914844	1919489	It was okay, but then, like, they had the stupid fucking bongo shit, and then... I don't know.
1919509	1920990	I don't know, the bongo games were interesting.
1921010	1929839	Yeah, but then they have those other ones where you had to, like, you know, use the bongos to, like, move up a, like... What was that one where you had to basically just use the L and R buttons on it?
1930480	1930780	I don't know.
1931281	1931561	I think...
1931857	1934058	A lot of the franchises out there kind of suck.
1934158	1936978	Ooh, Ranma made a good one that these guys left off the list.
1937138	1938559	Don't forget Spyro.
1939419	1941659	That's a great one that should have been on the list.
1942319	1943120	Good catch, Ranma.
1943160	1944040	Or Crash Bandicoot.
1944940	1947421	Those are both really good ones.
1947961	1949081	Let's see, what else do we have?
1949121	1952462	TheRobD says, yeah, but the last real Mario game came out 11 years ago.
1952562	1954162	Well, that would depend on what you consider a real Mario game.
1954182	1954682	How about Rampage?
1955603	1956443	Oh, that's a good one, too.
1957943	1959123	See, we should come up with our own list.
1959644	1961424	And of course, JeremyTodd1 says Metal Slug.
1962945	1963725	Actually.
1964425	1965326	What about Contra?
1967146	1968847	It's been a while since we had a Contra game, hasn't it?
1968887	1969847	No, last year.
1969867	1970887	Well, besides the arcade.
1971767	1972007	Really?
1972267	1972848	Well, I meant like 2005.
1973468	1977829	I mean, we had Shattered... Wait, not Shattered Soldier.
1977849	1981130	Damn, I don't remember the last one.
1981410	1984410	Vinpower says, I admit, I had a blast with the Mario is Missing games.
1984611	1985811	Well, I'm glad someone enjoyed it.
1985831	1986691	Ninja Turtle games.
1987631	1988592	Oh, good one.
1988952	1990372	See, we got some really good ones here.
1991189	1993230	But the list wasn't so bad as it was.
1994090	1994371	All right.
1994411	1998112	Well, another thing that's not so bad is reading your emails that we get every week.
1998152	1999213	In fact, we rather enjoy it.
1999413	2001134	And DarkSakura is queen of the mailbag.
2001174	2008877	And when you send your emails to mailbag at orangelaunchreader.com, DarkSakura will read and often respond to your emails and pick some of her favorites to read here on the program.
2009258	2013600	Again, because we do get quite a few letters, we can't read them all, but we can try.
2014020	2018862	So DarkSakura is going to open up the mailbag and dive on in and see what we've got to read this week.
2019002	2020463	DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag this week?
2026296	2026997	Two emails.
2028038	2028458	That's it?
2029079	2029359	Yeah.
2029619	2030900	Alright, well, let's do it.
2031261	2031501	Okay.
2032691	2039453	First one, SalutationsOLRCast, I just had a question about the Nintendo Wii, and if its games contain region coding, thanks for reading this.
2040033	2044774	Also, I don't know if you guys heard about this article, but someone tried to electrocute themselves with an arcade machine.
2045254	2051896	Their Pac-Man high score was beaten, and he claimed that he had nothing left to live for, so he attempted suicide with a Pac-Man machine.
2051976	2052756	Pretty weird, though.
2052776	2055577	He just comes from Zenith.
2055797	2058458	He should have just tipped the machine over on himself.
2059158	2060058	That wouldn't kill anybody.
2060118	2061819	I've had an arcade machine fall on me.
2063283	2066264	Um, first of all, um... Did it hit you in the head?
2068325	2069705	Because that might explain some stuff.
2070826	2072106	Teasing, just heart?
2073107	2074027	I'm letting you buy me dinner.
2075908	2077768	You can make it up to me with potato pancakes.
2077788	2078289	Fat chance.
2079309	2080790	Um, my car's dead.
2081150	2084631	Oh, um, as for the, the, uh... Would you like, would you like a nice cup?
2084691	2086172	Would you like me to bring you a cup of wah?
2087032	2089433	Rob, I'm trying to do emails, so you can shut up, okay?
2091354	2092454	All own...
2094215	2118811	Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie So at any rate, the Nintendo Wii is definitely region coded So yeah, but they're working on it, they're working on it And also about someone killing themselves over a score Darwin loves them Sorry, that type of person should be removed from the dream pool
2120371	2131996	Moving forward to the next and last email, pretty long one, coming to us from someone who has not signed the email, so I'm just going to say JCK.
2133663	2134624	Hey guys, great show.
2134704	2138727	Just wanted to give some feedback to two news items on last week's show.
2139147	2143831	The Dallas Area TV Network's WFAA has reported on the PS3 and Wii as a giveaway to porn.
2143851	2145132	I'm sorry, gateway to porn.
2145572	2147113	And the New York State bill... Really?
2147153	2148975	They're giving away porn on the PS3?
2149055	2149615	Now I'll buy one.
2149635	2150135	Hey Rob, shut up.
2150756	2158822	And the New York State bill A00547 and later the A02024 prohibiting the sale of certain games to minors.
2159282	2161464	Do you want to read the email though if you really want to talk?
2161829	2162409	No, no, I'm fine.
2162510	2164631	I'm going to go get more coffee for my Hello Kitty maker.
2189088	2192750	They are the ones who seek to censor and control every content distribution chain.
2195191	2200714	The problem is that the world cannot be made safe, even if we could agree on what safe is without oppressing sub-subculture somewhere.
2201274	2204255	It is impossible for any of us to remake the world in our own image.
2204296	2205156	We have to accept that...
2205785	2214372	that we don't like exist, that our children will stumble onto them if we don't shelter them or otherwise prepare them for that initial contact.
2214793	2220738	I may not agree with the religious conservatives who homeschool their kids and filter their TV, but at least they're active parents.
2221298	2223801	There are legal issues that surround the New York bills.
2224241	2226243	First of all, who decides what is objectionable?
2226343	2229405	The ESRB and MPAA are private industry bodies.
2229926	2233529	We cannot pass a law that deputizes these private bodies to rate things
2234096	2234497	DarkSakura.com
2251716	2256660	and PAA ratings and the gaming industry chooses to submit to the ESRB.
2257040	2266928	The public pressure is on retail distribution chains to comply with what forces the content creators to adhere which is why every major game retailer already checks ID.
2267308	2269910	The system works and there's no reason to change it.
2270911	2272472	And that's the end of the email.
2274734	2274934	Yes?
2275975	2276536	I got nothing.
2277957	2279398	I have to say that that's pretty...
2281016	2281837	I'd have to say yeah.
2282257	2293385	I mean, I agree with... If the government really... And see, this is... I have a whole problem with the government being way too involved in our personal lives.
2295766	2308375	I think that it is unreasonable to expect somebody else to protect their children from...
2309929	2310590	Thank you for watching!
2329857	2343746	The reference to the homeschool religious fundamentalist, a friend of my friends that I met here when I moved out to California, she had been so sheltered homeschooled.
2343786	2354174	She actually didn't go to school until she was in high school and thought that oral sex was talking about sex.
2357768	2359889	I knew someone who thought the F word was fart.
2363130	2373054	And so when confronted with the reality of their ignorance, you know, who's to blame but their parents, you know, keeping them from the stuff that's going on in the real world.
2373514	2383619	And to go back to the statement regarding needing a governmental body to participate with a government-controlled law.
2384379	2386020	Oh, I guess it's the government-controlled.
2386080	2386880	That's not redundant.
2387378	2403966	But I understand the logic in that, but I still think that if we have a private party that is not involved in the government, we are likely to get less, I would say, bias.
2404686	2406687	I'm sorry, our government is bought and paid for.
2407548	2409709	You know, for every...
2410808	2421216	Person that you elect into government positions, there's a lobbyist behind them paying lots of money for them to say, you know, I think that cigarettes are okay.
2422577	2424198	Is that why Travis is running for president?
2426860	2427281	I don't know.
2427861	2428381	I don't know either.
2428502	2429562	I was just putting that out there.
2430383	2436388	So, I actually think that it is better for us to have that separation with those facilities and the government.
2437248	2439570	I think the law is unnecessary, and I agree, unenforceable.
2440071	2441972	The way it's current incarnation.
2443853	2444053	All right.
2444073	2447354	Well, I read through the email while you were ranting there, and it was well thought out.
2447895	2450036	I like getting those thoughtful emails.
2450096	2452357	I love when people with brains email us.
2452497	2452777	All right.
2453097	2455878	So you should email us to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
2455938	2456819	And please be smart.
2458079	2461321	Oh, dude, we got another email just as I was closing the box.
2461341	2463702	They're already smart because they listen to this program.
2464142	2465042	I'm going to read this now.
2465983	2466223	What's this?
2466243	2467163	This is by Nintendomaniac64.
2467183	2467364	Uh-huh.
2468686	2473871	WorthOfThousandWords.com, an entry into this Internet Porn Tycoon.
2475032	2475812	Oh, I get it.
2475833	2477854	They've got a picture of that.
2478515	2481177	Somebody had already done this on this WorthOfThousand.com.
2481378	2484360	Somebody photoshopped Railroad Tycoon and says, Internet Porn Tycoon.
2484380	2484761	There you go.
2485241	2485962	That's awesome.
2486462	2488464	Yeah, thank you for sharing that with us, Nintendo Maniacs.
2488604	2489525	Too bad it's not real.
2490686	2491126	I know.
2491867	2493048	Well, I can only hope.
2493108	2494169	By MicroProbe.
2494229	2494970	That's fantastic.
2496409	2498731	Oh, MicroProse was the one that made it originally.
2499051	2499812	I see what they did there.
2501132	2501993	Yay, Photoshop!
2502413	2509758	Anyways, so in the past, PlayStation Portable Firmware has been defeated by Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories.
2510458	2516862	And of course, you know, Sony went and apparently fixed the hole, or so they thought.
2517955	2526937	Now, people have found another way using Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, one of the original copies, that you can once again break the firmware.
2527237	2528157	And what have they done?
2528377	2529218	Yep, they've done it.
2529398	2538500	They've made their wonderful Hello World proof of concept thing, and even today, which just got released, a downgrader for firmware 3.03.
2538900	2541740	So try as you might, Sony, you'll just never win.
2542081	2543001	Never, ever.
2543541	2543821	So...
2544713	2547415	This is why consoles shouldn't have firmwares.
2547695	2552279	They should just be good to go instead of having to upgrade.
2552379	2554420	What's the big deal about homebrew on the PSP anyway?
2554800	2555561	Is it really that bad?
2556141	2558003	Is it really killing families across America?
2558103	2560845	Is it really something that has to be prevented at all costs?
2561285	2561425	No.
2561685	2568830	In fact, they're encouraging it on the PlayStation 3, but that's still when people are going to pirate the, you know, they're going to break the firmware to pirate shit, so.
2569091	2573754	I was reading somewhere else that HD DVD, of course, you know, they finally had to admit that, yes, it's been cracked.
2574454	2574855	Hey, Rob.
2575055	2575215	What?
2575455	2577517	This kick to your ass is courtesy of DMN.
2578338	2578559	What?
2579440	2579640	Yep.
2580621	2590412	Tell DMN to go suck on a... Anyway, I wanted to just say really quickly, and then we're going to get into the Skype line and hear what you guys have to say and play a voicemail.
2590532	2592414	We got one voicemail this week that's pretty interesting.
2592434	2593055	I want you guys to hear it.
2593655	2595117	I want to say this real quickly.
2595157	2595838	You might remember...
2596781	2598101	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2620908	2621689	and Stingus.
2621829	2623550	And then they die when they sting you.
2623751	2625512	If you love bees, check out the site.
2625572	2626933	It's ilovebees.com.
2627594	2627894	All right.
2628074	2631658	We're going to get into the Skype line and take some of your calls here live on Orange Lounge Radio.
2631698	2634820	But first, I want to play a voicemail that came into our line this week.
2634840	2637002	And, of course, we always invite your voicemails on any topic.
2637603	2641506	You can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR when we're not live.
2641746	2643708	Or for those of you guys outside the U.S.
2643748	2646931	or Canada where that number is toll free, you can always give us a call on the Skype line at
2647165	2650466	Just download Skype and call username OrangeLoungeRadio.
2650486	2650886	That's us.
2650986	2652467	And you can leave us a message throughout the week.
2653207	2655588	But keep in mind, if you call right now, you're probably going to get on the Skype line.
2655608	2656468	We'll take you live on air.
2656508	2660430	But if you're the type that likes to formulate your thoughts first and then leave us a voicemail, you can do that.
2660710	2664231	Or sometimes we get other craziness on our voicemail line.
2664271	2665251	And I mean craziness.
2665431	2667452	So check this out because this is pretty crazy.
2667732	2672234	And you might have to listen kind of carefully because they talk fast because you can definitely sense there's a lot of excitement in the room.
2672294	2672974	So check this out.
2674460	2681466	Hey Rob, it's me, I just finished on the Freezpop concert, it was awesome, I have a little surprise for you, hold on.
2681486	2692816	Yo Rob, this is Sean from Freezpop, what's going on man, I'm just chatting, we're like, wait, is he going to show up tonight, we don't know, is he going to fly in, I don't know, is he going to fly in tonight, I don't know, we're looking for like helicopters, you're not here.
2693076	2699902	Anyway, this is Sean from Freezpop, hope you're doing well, rock out, good times, guitar hero, fun times, anime, good times, all around you.
2700042	2702684	Freezpop, here's Adam again, he's got something he has to say.
2709932	2713415	Okay, let me translate because those guys talked faster than the Micro Machines guy.
2713755	2722202	That apparently was Sean from Freeze Pop leaving the message because Ranma went to the concert in New York City the other night and got them to leave a message.
2722222	2722923	That's funny.
2726152	2729133	See, sometimes we get craziness on the voicemail line.
2729153	2734354	So I encourage you folks, program the 877-GAME-OLR into your cell phone.
2734394	2746518	And when you come across internet celebrities such as this guy from Freeze Pop, then you should have them call in and leave us crazy voicemails because, you know, that's fun.
2747538	2747778	All right.
2748459	2750140	We're going to open up our Skype line.
2750620	2756063	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR or it's username Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
2756083	2762687	We want to offer up you guys to interact with our program here on Orange Lounge Radio because, you know, it doesn't have to be all about us.
2763288	2764248	I mean, to some extent.
2764268	2764909	It could be all about me.
2765209	2768971	To some extent it does have to be all about us, but we want it to be about you guys as well.
2769411	2772893	So give us a call right now on the Skype line and we'll take some calls.
2774274	2775535	Let's start off with this call tonight.
2776215	2777276	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2777296	2777636	Who's this?
2779107	2781729	This is DMN sans really crappy microphone.
2782069	2784311	Hi, DMN sans really crappy microphone.
2784371	2786713	Hey, I'm going to kick your ass next time I see you.
2787393	2788514	Bring it, motherfucker.
2788714	2789075	All right.
2791677	2791897	What?
2792317	2793858	Oh, wow, I'm just reading in the chatroom.
2793878	2799503	Apparently, 2DX Gold is supposed to be at Konami Gamers Day, which we're going to next week.
2799543	2800163	That's pretty hot.
2800203	2800604	Oh, really?
2801204	2802465	I don't know where the hell that came from.
2802505	2804046	Somebody just blurted that out in chat.
2805327	2806308	Can somebody back that up?
2806809	2807409	I wouldn't doubt it.
2807834	2808414	Oh, no, I see.
2808614	2811015	Meklar, oh, and 2DXGold is going over to America.
2811075	2812095	Left the UK a day ago.
2812115	2813275	Not sure where it's going, though.
2813555	2815556	You guys got any big conventions or game shows soon?
2815616	2818457	And Jason put it together that it must be coming over to Konami Gamers Day.
2819077	2819477	That's pretty hot.
2819497	2820657	It's coming to SakuraCon.
2820677	2821237	That's where it's going.
2821257	2822618	I'm so playing the Ghostbusters song.
2822678	2823458	We'll see what happens.
2823518	2823818	I don't know.
2823858	2824658	I don't know what's going to happen.
2824878	2827179	We're going to have a full report on Konami Gamers Day next week.
2827199	2828379	And keep an eye on our website.
2828917	2829758	Thursday and Friday.
2831479	2838803	All the news that we get there is embargoed until a certain time, but the minute that embargo's up, we're going to post a ton of shit from the show, so we're really excited.
2839343	2840624	Anyway, DMM, what's on your mind tonight?
2842105	2842685	Three things.
2842965	2847248	One, huge STFU announcement.
2847468	2848829	This is your Thursday night program, yes?
2849309	2849549	Yes.
2849809	2855673	Not this week, but next week, we're going to have MC Frontalot on the show for five good minutes.
2855693	2856433	I hate you!
2856934	2857534	No, you don't.
2858962	2860143	I knew Jamie would be pissed.
2860203	2862585	Tell him to say something for me and record it, please.
2864086	2866627	How about we Skype you in and you can talk to him?
2867268	2869990	I have school.
2870010	2871311	When are you guys taping it?
2871331	2872231	Because you don't do it live.
2872251	2872992	When are you guys taping it?
2873752	2874093	I don't know.
2874133	2877955	I'll keep you posted, but I'll kick Jimmy to the curb and you can interview with me.
2877975	2878556	There you go.
2878716	2880177	I have school every night this week, dude.
2881097	2882659	Well, it's not this week.
2882719	2883199	It's next week.
2885557	2888340	Why don't your people talk to his people and see what you can come up with?
2888360	2889241	My people will talk to your people.
2889261	2890482	All right, maybe we can get them on this show.
2890742	2893084	Well, anyway, so that's exciting news for you guys.
2893144	2894966	You guys are getting more celebrities than we are.
2896087	2896927	What the fuck?
2897027	2898028	It's all Jimmy's fault.
2898108	2899570	We've been around for five years.
2899950	2904494	You guys are on like nine weeks, and you're having freaking... Fuck you.
2905875	2906095	All right.
2906416	2907397	Love you too, Rob.
2907417	2909438	Did you just call to rub it in, or is there anything else you want to say?
2909478	2910739	No, I actually had two things.
2912203	2915585	I have a review of Bookworm Adventures.
2916106	2918667	Dude, Bookworm Adventures is awesome.
2919388	2922230	Pretty much the greatest casual game ever made.
2923851	2925031	That's what Xbox Live needs.
2925792	2928093	It's $30 for the full version.
2928113	2929935	That sounds kind of steep.
2931155	2931996	So I have a keyboard.
2932316	2933477	Yeah, but not everyone does.
2933577	2937239	Well, fuck them.
2937800	2939361	It's $30 for the full version.
2939381	2941402	It's a bit steep, but very much worth it.
2942515	2947117	exciting is there any particular reason you love Bookworm Adventures?
2947317	2950598	is it the smarts you get to use in constructing words?
2950658	2951338	is it the graphics?
2951378	2952159	what is it about the game?
2953279	2969225	it's that and it's the charm and the game makes this really crazy deep voice like a voiceover guy if you beat the crap out of an enemy it's like CRUSH it's pretty cool can you do that one more time please?
2970085	2971706	CRUSH that's pretty awesome
2972389	2973990	Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, DMN?
2975190	2976491	Yeah, bonus segment.
2976571	2977711	I wanted to talk about that.
2977771	2987975	I know the podcast listeners didn't hear it, but I actually can totally sympathize with that one lady because I just broke up with my girlfriend over WoW.
2988656	2988916	Really?
2989016	2994438	I remember calling her or you or the both of you during Guys on a Show one night.
2994498	2996419	No, it wasn't Guys on a Show.
2996459	2998320	It was this show when I was really fucking plastered.
2998480	2999760	Oh, that's right, when you called in here drunk.
3000701	3001521	So you guys broke up?
3002618	3003718	Over WoW, what happened?
3004058	3004599	Over WoW?
3005339	3016721	Well, one, I came over to visit her several weeks ago, and she decided that playing WoW and raiding was more important than spending time with me, and that kind of pissed me off.
3017262	3022923	And then I called her earlier this week to see if she wanted to do something, and she's like, no, I'm playing Burning Crusade.
3022963	3023823	I'm trying to get 70.
3023903	3025244	I'm like, okay, you know what?
3025444	3025864	That's it.
3026464	3027504	I'm done with this shit.
3028104	3028744	What do you want?
3028844	3031285	Do you want level 70 or cocked?
3032023	3033084	You need to make a decision.
3034025	3034805	Is that what you told her?
3035185	3041530	Just like, you know, you find WoW more important than, you know, hanging out with me and I care about you and I do all this shit for you.
3042711	3044292	Look, that's how I would break it down.
3044552	3051378	I would say, you know, if I was having this problem in a relationship, I would say, look, do you want level 70 or do you want the cock?
3051718	3052679	Because you can't have both.
3055341	3057762	I game and I get laid when I want it.
3058363	3058663	All right.
3059564	3061265	Well, that's because you married a nerd.
3061792	3062372	Yes, I did.
3062392	3063393	It's great.
3063754	3064854	DMN, anything else you want to share?
3064874	3065695	We've got to let some other people on.
3065715	3067356	You need to tell Rob he parks like an asshole.
3069478	3071039	Yeah, Rob, your parking sucks.
3071860	3072120	Really?
3072200	3073301	Why does my parking suck?
3073661	3075843	Okay, when I was down... Oops, we lost the connection.
3077924	3083228	If you would like to call us, our username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

3085250	3085790	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3090390	3092412	That's toll free in the United States.
3092432	3093933	Hey, Rob can't hang up on me.
3095534	3096835	No, but I can unplug your mic.
3097195	3099457	Yeah, and I can steal yours and beat you in the head with it.
3100218	3100938	What was that, Jamie?
3104822	3105382	Ow, ow.
3105722	3106403	Damn, it hurt.
3106483	3109385	Mike is like hardwired in that fucking mix board.
3109405	3113268	That's because my powerful, awesome voice has fused it there.
3115670	3116691	I totally owned Rob.
3117412	3117792	Whatever.
3120267	3121247	Sorry if I broke your arm.
3122128	3124029	You'll just have to give me a free massage.
3129131	3132213	You'll just have to give me a free massage from MassageTheRapist.com.
3136795	3139256	I take my profession seriously.
3139316	3140757	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.
3140837	3141357	Who's this?
3141998	3142778	Legend of Zaku.
3142918	3143739	Hi, Legend of Zaku.
3143759	3144459	What's on your mind, buddy?
3145336	3150979	Nah, you, uh, all that 2DX stuff that I've been hearing from, from Over the Pond.
3152119	3152960	Over the Pond, yeah.
3153300	3156842	Yeah, that whole Ghostbusters thing that kind of shocked us last week.
3157402	3157542	Uh-huh.
3158462	3158923	Remember?
3158943	3161624	Yeah, yeah, okay, what about it?
3162580	3163881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3189952	3200461	You also know that Bettson mentioned in a press release that they're supposed to be having, you know, one of their top guys said that they're supposed to be having a content update for Supernova.
3200481	3203163	They're supposed to add 200 to 300 more songs into it.
3203183	3206826	200 to 300 more songs in DDR Supernova in the arcade?
3207506	3208747	Show Bettson press release.
3208907	3209148	Wow.
3210580	3211261	Well, who knows?
3211381	3212702	This could be something they're announcing.
3212762	3215504	I think Konami's gearing up for lots of announcements this week.
3215544	3219047	They've been kind of quiet, so I think we're going to get just blasted with stuff.
3220107	3223090	I think if that is true, you'll hear about it Thursday.
3223550	3231016	If you don't hear about it then, or Friday, I don't know when the news is embargoed, but Thursday or Friday, if you don't hear after that, it probably wasn't true.
3232997	3234699	But I could do it right now.
3234799	3235099	Watch.
3235659	3236760	I'll post it up on chat.
3237681	3238001	Yeah.
3238642	3238982	Here we go.
3239827	3245829	Well, okay, but how often are things talked about that don't necessarily happen, such as Link Mode?
3247209	3250270	Well, that was never Konami or Benson's fault.
3250290	3253491	That was because they got shafted by the people that were supposed to make the part for them.
3254552	3262614	And so, you know, I was disappointed at first, but I let that slide because I have faith that Konami might find another way.
3263515	3264775	But if they don't, so be it.
3265549	3268151	I mean, they'll eventually find an alternative.
3268411	3270893	It won't be now, right?
3271053	3274795	Probably in the next... Alright, you been playing anything else besides Bomani lately?
3275876	3279078	Uh, more in the Groove R21, and I just played Drum Mania today.
3279739	3280560	Okay, let me rephrase.
3280580	3282861	Have you been playing anything that is not a music game?
3283842	3286183	Uh, Initial... I started playing Initial D today.
3286384	3286944	Alright, there you go.
3286964	3287384	That's something.
3287504	3288165	And in the arcade?
3289005	3289286	Yeah.
3290186	3291247	I bought the card and everything.
3291907	3292308	How is that?
3292428	3294109	Is there a lot of competition in your neck of the woods?
3295146	3297186	I actually traveled out of state today.
3297206	3304888	It was a tournament, so I managed to play, you know, in addition to other stuff, I just played, you know, I managed to get into Initial D while I was at it.
3304988	3305928	So, yeah.
3306628	3313210	I mean, it wasn't that much, but it's really hard to find an Initial D machine in Chinatown anyways.
3313290	3317050	I know one place, but I will make efforts to follow up on that.
3317451	3317631	Alright.
3318211	3324812	Alright, well, Zaku, your voice is breaking up a little bit, but thanks so much for calling in, as you always do, and we'll talk to you another time, alrighty?
3325818	3353751	have a good one if you want to give us a call it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or it's username Orange Lounge Radio on Skype if you're sick of the same old people calling in week after week then you're not helping because you're not calling us so you should get on your telephone and give us a call right now it's 1-877-GAME-OLR otherwise it's going to be the same people get through every week or you can always leave us a voicemail because I know some folks can't listen live on Sunday and so they want to you know interact with us in other ways so
3355005	3356506	I guess we'll do one more call.
3356546	3359208	We'll go over to this one.
3359468	3360609	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3360629	3360949	Who's this?
3362229	3362790	It's Ranma.
3362870	3363790	How are you guys doing?
3363850	3364651	Hey, Ranma.
3365191	3366812	You've already been on the show today.
3367112	3367873	Your voicemail.
3369354	3371715	Well, I do what I can to help the show out.
3371735	3372175	You know me.
3372195	3373296	I love you guys and girls.
3373476	3373876	I know.
3373976	3374436	It was cool.
3374477	3374897	Thanks a lot.
3374917	3381040	That's fun to... You know, we had Freeze Pop, at least we had a casting from Freeze Pop about a year ago on the show, and it was very nice.
3381300	3383061	I wish them a lot of success.
3383101	3383942	They're a good bunch.
3385552	3386032	Sweetness.
3386092	3389113	I also hope you liked the voicemail I left you on your personal line.
3390733	3391393	You know what?
3391613	3393354	It cut out.
3393714	3394634	What was it supposed to be?
3394654	3396454	Because I heard a couple notes.
3396474	3397614	They were playing a song.
3397895	3401855	It sounded like they were starting to play a song, but you were obviously indoors because it cut out.
3401915	3402776	What were you trying to leave?
3404516	3405836	Let's talk more rock.
3406836	3407276	Ah, okay.
3407557	3409097	See, all I could hear, this is the voicemail.
3409117	3410897	It was like, this is for you, Rob.
3412077	3412998	And then that's all I could hear.
3413038	3414738	And then it went, you know, cell phone drop.
3416069	3417210	You might need to switch carriers.
3418611	3422293	Because when we played that, there were a few people that showed up with their Guitar Hero controllers.
3422313	3425275	They moved towards the front and started, like, freestyling on the song.
3425375	3428457	People showed up with their Guitar Hero controller to the Freeze Pop concert?
3429417	3433220	Yes, one of my friends, Aaron, he got them to sign his controller.
3433580	3434380	That's pretty hardcore.
3434400	3434921	I like that, though.
3434941	3435341	That's rad.
3435861	3436742	Yeah, definitely.
3437842	3438123	All right.
3438663	3440404	Well, anything else you want to share with us, Ranma?
3440624	3442065	Did you have a good time at the concert overall?
3443308	3445609	Yes, I did, and I also picked up another video game.
3445669	3447030	I got Elite Beat Agents.
3447430	3449151	Ooh, Elite Beat Agents, one of my favorites from 06.
3449251	3450091	What did you think?
3451872	3452393	It's fun.
3452613	3456575	It's not as easy as O and Don, but I'm enjoying it.
3457755	3460797	Wait until the difficulty really ramps up as you go through it.
3462058	3462858	Oh, I believe it.
3462918	3465079	I'm trying to finish the last song on easy.
3465599	3465840	All right.
3466980	3470162	All right, well, Ranma, thanks so much for the call, and thanks for the voicemails.
3470182	3470702	We appreciate it.
3471769	3473250	No problem.
3473330	3476752	My friend Patty agrees with you, what you said about the whole Wii incident.
3477032	3477673	Just letting you know.
3478133	3479374	Alright, thanks for the support.
3480254	3480515	Later.
3480535	3481155	Alright, bye.
3481655	3483416	Alright, thanks so much to all of our callers tonight.
3483436	3484097	We appreciate it.
3484137	3485478	If you didn't get through, that's okay.
3485498	3486759	You can always leave us a voicemail.
3486879	3490201	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR when we're not live.
3490781	3493563	Now I'm going to open it up to any last minute stories we have here in studio.
3493583	3494704	Any last minute stories from anyone?
3495044	3495304	Oh yeah.
3496265	3496665	Loki.
3496705	3496925	Loki.
3498120	3502883	Anyways, some interesting stuff for the PSP, including a brand new game coming to it.
3502923	3505425	This should get Jamie happy, or very happy here.
3505805	3506266	Happity.
3506586	3508667	Happity, yes, very happity.
3510689	3512850	Dracula X, Rondo of Blood.
3512910	3513110	What?
3513991	3519055	Is coming to the PSP, according to UK-based game magazine Play.
3520796	3522657	So, that's kind of cool.
3522677	3524438	Pretty.
3525299	3526179	Other stuff, though...
3527403	3528103	Let's see here.
3528623	3533905	If you're expecting Final Fantasy XIII this year, sorry to disappoint you, but that's not happening.
3533925	3534485	Dream on.
3534625	3535465	We all knew that.
3535686	3542528	According to Tetsuya Nomura himself, he said it's not going to happen.
3542908	3547649	He says, hopefully going to be out in 2008.
3547769	3551170	Yeah, and that's even that.
3551730	3556052	They'll probably get it late 2008 in Japan, and then we won't get it here until like 2019.
3557406	3557906	Which sucks.
3558766	3561367	Because that'll be when I get a PlayStation 3, it'll be 2009.
3561407	3561727	Yeah.
3563527	3578091	According to Midway, because I know they've had their Midway's Gamer Day, was actually last week, they had some info regarding the Midway Classics that are going to be on the PlayStation Network.
3578591	3582772	Of course, some of the pricing for that, Demon Slayer,
3583408	3589211	is going to be $4.99 and should hit the PlayStation Store in the next few months.
3590952	3596555	But it doesn't really say what are the other costs on like say for example the Mortal Kombat games or anything like that.
3598456	3599277	But they look good though.
3599297	3605660	They have some screenshots actually online now of like Mortal Kombat and Rampart and Super Sprint and stuff like that.
3606220	3607501	So that's kind of cool.
3609142	3609482	And then
3609986	3638853	I don't know what the hell this is but apparently there's this homebrew program called Mini VMAC for the DS where apparently they're running Mac OS on a DS which is so wrong but okay and then of course a PlayStation 3 ISO loader is being worked on right now and hopefully it'll be done soon they're in testing phase so Piracy on the PlayStation 3 coming soon
3640882	3642363	I'm sure Sony's thrilled to hear that news.
3642843	3643083	Oh yeah.
3643623	3645584	DarkSakura, you have anything for us last minute?
3645984	3647645	No, I just have my usual awesome.
3649265	3652146	Alright, well then I guess that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
3652486	3657148	Hey guys, thanks so much for tuning in to us, downloading it, and supporting independent internet radio.

3670612	3671632	Talk about more games.
3672072	3678655	So until then, this is Rob Roberts for DarkSakura and Loki saying see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
