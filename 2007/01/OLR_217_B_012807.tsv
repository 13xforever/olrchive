0	22060	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
22060	26860	We are here on this lovely Sunday evening, January 28, 2007 for more of Orange Lounge
26860	27860	Radio.
27860	32480	We're going to get into Part B. My throat is feeling a little bit better, but I'm going
32480	36000	to step out of the room for just a second to get some coffee out of my Hello Kitty coffee
36000	37000	maker.
37000	39920	For those who didn't listen to Part A, my throat is kind of bad tonight.
39920	42560	So I'm going to go get some more hot stuff to drink.
42560	45520	And can you guys take care of some gaming news for a minute?
45520	46520	Why not?
46520	47520	I would really appreciate that.
47520	48520	All right.
48520	54840	Anyways, so starting things off, this week Microsoft had announced their earnings for
54840	56160	their quarter.
56160	61600	And of course, the profits were down, but at least the 360 revenues were up.
61600	66240	Well, unfortunately Microsoft went back and revised their earnings statements, basically
66240	74780	saying that their expected 360 shipments for 2007 and spring, they reduced it down from
74780	78120	$13 million, $15 million to $12 million.
78120	80600	This is due to unsold inventories in stores.
80600	86500	So basically, you know that big tower of 360s that you see in your Best Buys and your Game
86500	87500	Stops.
87500	92980	Well, because of that, they are dropping their shipments amount because who needs to ship
92980	96240	more units if there's tons in the stores.
96240	100920	Anyways, and because of that, all these stocks from other companies have dropped a little
100920	103200	bit as well because of that news.
103200	105000	So it's not a big surprise.
105000	108560	I mean, the PlayStation 3 is kind of in the same boat right now where they have a ton
108560	112120	of units in stores and no one's really buying them because there's not a lot of games out
112120	114720	right now or it's too expensive.
114720	120440	Either way, one of the analysts, PJ McNeely, said, video game publishers will be under
120440	126580	pressure today after Microsoft cuts its life-to-date shipment.
126580	133120	There is investor concern about reset of expectations around both the Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation
133120	134120	3.
134120	139840	So, pretty much, I guess they're playing it safe.
139840	140840	I missed all that.
140840	141840	Could you repeat it?
141840	142840	No.
142840	148920	It's basically Microsoft shipping or they're reducing their amount of shipments that they're
148920	149920	going to be...
149920	154380	No, I heard Microsoft's goal went down a little bit and I can see the impact that's having
154380	156800	on things as a whole.
156800	159200	It's only down to being a few million, I guess.
159200	163040	That's kind of bad, but they just have to sell the units that they have right now and
163040	167240	trust me, those units will be gone once Halo 3 comes out.
167240	168240	Even maybe Crackdown.
168240	169680	I mean, Crackdown might sell a few.
169680	176440	I don't know about selling units for beta, but it couldn't hurt, I guess.
176440	180040	This is a report coming from QJ.net speaking of the Xbox 360.
180040	181720	This is a little bit of a hack.
181720	186040	You can use this at your own risk, but apparently, a hack has been released, the HDD Hacker,
186040	191360	that will allow you to use your own hard drive with the Xbox 360.
191360	193600	Now, keep in mind there are some limitations.
193600	200400	You can only really use a Western Digital BEVS series and only a 20 gigabyte hard drive,
200400	203600	but keep in mind if you do it that way, a 20 gigabyte hard drive through Western Digital
203600	212120	is going to be a hell of a lot cheaper than a regular Xbox 360 hard drive through Microsoft.
212120	216180	The site goes on to say that once bigger Microsoft certified hard drives come out, then you'll
216180	219640	be able to use those with the tool, but I'm thinking, no, you won't.
219640	222360	Microsoft is very good about patching this shit as soon as they find it, and I bet you
222360	227240	by this time next week, we'll see a patch roll out on live that will prevent this.
227240	229640	The next patch that goes out on live will shut this thing out.
229640	230640	No, I don't think so.
230640	231640	Why is that?
231640	236200	The reason why this does is actually there's information on the hard drive sector that's
236200	240640	the same on all the hard drives because they have to be universal since they're working
240640	242720	with all these different systems.
242720	249480	It's basically some sort of identified device type of thing that's stored in one sector
249480	255560	so all they do is basically mimic that on this hard drive so all it thinks is that it's
255560	261240	a legit hard drive so there would be no way to patch this because it's a peripheral.
261240	266720	It would be like if I took a controller for the 360 and I made it look like that's an
266720	268600	official Microsoft controller.
268600	274160	There's no way for it to tell between whether this is real or not.
274160	277240	You follow the hack stuff more than I do so I'll take your word for it, but this just
277240	280280	seems like the kind of thing that Microsoft's usually all over, but I'll take your word
280280	281280	for it.
281280	284080	It's not like modifying firmware or anything like that so I think that they wouldn't be
284080	287000	able to patch this.
287000	289920	We'll see what happens.
289920	300200	Going into things that have not quite yet having to do with the Xbox 360, let me just
300200	302480	rephrase this.
302480	307720	You're all familiar with the Unreal Engine, right?
307720	308720	Sure.
308720	310640	There's been some good games coming out of that.
310640	313840	Well guess who's just licensed it?
313840	316360	It's been licensed by Squeenix.
316360	317360	Really?
317360	318360	Yep.
318360	332440	There's basically a statement put out by the general manager of R&D at Square Enix that's
332440	339560	Taku Murata, saying that it will speed up the creation process and allow developers
339560	344200	to spend less time working on the technology.
344200	348240	To quote, the complexity of next generation game systems featuring HD graphics and multi-core
348240	353160	parallel processing poses a number of technological challenges to our game development, however
353160	357360	we can expedite our game development process significantly while allowing extra time and
357360	361480	resources to be spent on game design and mechanics.
361480	366600	So does this mean we're going to be killing slimes in 3D, as somebody in chat said?
366600	367600	Maybe.
367600	368600	I like this thought.
368600	371040	DrewNami says, Kingdom Hearts 3 using the Unreal Engine.
371040	372360	Wouldn't that be hot?
372360	374400	I have a boner just thinking about it.
374400	375400	Just kidding, just kidding.
375400	377280	But still, that's pretty exciting.
377280	378280	The Unreal Engine's pretty good.
378280	384320	There's actually a little bit more information regarding the Unreal Tournament itself.
384320	391320	Unreal Tournament 2007 is now renamed as Unreal Tournament 3 and is going to be on Xbox 360.
391320	396760	It was confirmed at Midway's Gamers' Day in Las Vegas.
396760	402440	It's going to be developed with the PC and PS3 versions.
402440	406920	It has release later on this year.
406920	408480	I don't know.
408480	409740	It's Unreal.
409740	411280	You know one thing I do like about Unreal?
411280	414560	I haven't played a whole lot of it, but one thing I did play it on the original Xbox because
414560	416360	I bought it when it was like 20 bucks.
416360	417360	It's fucking fast.
417360	420040	It is like one of the fastest shooters I've ever played.
420040	421440	It's amazingly fast.
421440	422440	I like it.
422440	425720	Even just the first Unreal Tournament was crazy.
425720	427840	That was a game that gave me some freaking motion sickness right there.
427840	430840	Yeah, I was going to say, you probably are not having much fun with those games with
430840	432280	how fast they move.
432280	436160	There's also a little bit more as far as, not necessarily just the graphics, but different
436160	438160	multiplayer modes.
438160	444480	There is a voice-controlled AI and player-controlled vehicles.
444480	450160	There's also a conquest mode that will be a battle for eight teams on a map that's three
450160	456360	times the size of the deathmatch and onslaught maps.
456360	463200	Speaking about Square Enix here, NCSX has reported that Square Enix is going to be producing
463200	470120	a collection of replica weapons called the Square Enix Master Arms Collection.
470120	473840	It's basically going to be some of the weapons from the Final Fantasy series and Keyblade
473840	475320	from Kingdom Hearts.
475320	480480	Unfortunately, they are not going to be full-sized, so don't get your hopes up there, but they're
480480	489080	going to range from 15 centimeters for, like, Cerberus to 26 centimeters for Sephora's
489080	490080	Gunblade.
490080	494240	So, right now there's four different blades to choose from.
494240	500920	Let's see, Cerberus, which I believe, I can't remember which Final Fantasy that was from.
500920	512040	The Keyblade, of course, from Kingdom Hearts, Squall's Gunblade, from eight, and Sephora's
512040	515160	Gunblade from eight as well.
515160	516160	But they look kind of cool.
516160	523000	Of course, though, the prices aren't too expensive right now, only, well, they're $39 for each
523000	524000	one.
524000	525000	Awesome.
525000	530400	I just wish they had full-sized ones, of course, then people might kill each other and who
530400	531400	would want that?
531400	532400	Yeah, that would hurt.
532400	534960	This sounds like something you'd have in your house, Dark Sakura.
534960	535960	Maybe.
535960	537960	I have school to pay for.
537960	538960	Alright.
538960	543400	Well, speaking about Square Enix, you know, of course, Final Fantasy is a big game that's
543400	550940	going to be coming out on PlayStation 3, and, you know, when PlayStation 3 came out, a lot
550940	555580	of folks were using Final Fantasy XII, a PlayStation 2 game, on their PlayStation 3.
555580	559560	But there were some problems, and that would be the way the game looked, because they looked
559560	560560	uglier.
560560	561560	Remember, we talked about this on the show a while back.
561560	562560	Yeah.
562560	564560	There was a YouTube video that showed, like, the side-by-side comparisons.
564560	565760	Well, guess what?
565760	569680	There's an upcoming firmware update that is going to include a patch that we fixed.
569680	570680	It's already up.
570680	571680	Oh, did it already go up?
571680	572680	It already went up.
572680	573680	I don't have a PlayStation 3, so I don't know.
573680	574680	Yeah.
574680	579800	But apparently it went up, and they did this whole little change there, is that the PlayStation
579800	584720	1 and 2 games now will run right, and they'll look fine.
584720	588480	And now you can also, they also did some other little things, like you can set an image photo
588480	593080	for a user ID, and da-da-da, all this other little minor crap, Korean keyboards and stuff
593080	594080	you can use now.
594080	599280	You know, it's weird though, and you know on your PSP how during the months it'll change
599280	600560	colors in the background?
600560	606400	Well, the PS3 backgrounds will slowly fade from one color to another as time goes on
606400	607400	through the month.
607400	609800	It might start off black, and now it's yellow.
609800	611440	It's kind of weird.
611440	612600	Ew, yellow?
612600	613600	Yeah.
613600	615080	Not my favorite color.
615080	622280	Well, I actually know yellow is associated with aggression, so it's not my favorite either.
622280	627920	But there's actually though a little bit more news coming out regarding an animated Castlevania
627920	633880	3 movie, or yeah, the Dracula's Curse movie.
633880	639880	They're basically looking, they're still in the early stages of their production.
639880	643040	They're working on the visual development side of everything.
643040	648040	So it's through February, it's going to be mostly character creature design.
648040	650800	They need background designers, background painters.
650800	656600	They're actually looking for artists to work with that, so they actually have opened up
656600	659640	positions in Southern California.
659640	665400	If you actually want to submit your portfolio to them, you can actually email Belmont at
665400	667920	Castlevania Dracula's Curse dot com.
667920	669320	I think that's pretty cool.
669320	672320	They're looking for artists.
672320	673320	Give us some work.
673320	676040	I like to see that when it comes out.
676040	682660	Well, unfortunately, there have been some other bad vampire movies, including Blood
682660	688120	Rain, which is up for six Razzies.
688120	694240	It's received nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Supporting Actor, Worst
694240	699820	Supporting Actress, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay.
699820	707600	So that's, I guess, good news if you really hate Blood Rain.
707600	710640	Although if you do hate Blood Rain, you would probably be disappointed to know that he's
710640	716020	playing a sequel, and it's, I think, already in production, so that kind of sucks.
716020	721000	One other movie that he has coming out, though, pretty soon is going to be Postal, and IGN
721000	724280	had some news from that, actually, talking about some of the things that are going to
724280	729760	be offending people, including such wonderful things as full frontal nudity from news radios
729760	730760	Dave Foley.
730760	736440	Apparently, he's going to be playing some crazy cult leader.
736440	738320	And there's one scene...
738320	739320	Hooray.
739320	744120	I mean, I realize you guys know I'm gay and all, but I'm not thrilled to hear about that.
744120	746480	I mean, he's kind of old.
746480	751600	Anyways, Dave Foley's character in the production is called Uncle Dave, and is a twisted cult
751600	757080	leader who uses his religious doctrine to keep his subjects in a constant state of servitude,
757080	765000	and he exploits this by luring them into orgies at their debauchery, and says in the scenes
765000	769680	that they saw, Foley was dressed in an open robe, and they mean open, wandering around
769680	773400	the room, barking orders, and at the end of the scene, he takes a crap on camera.
773400	775840	Yeah, that's the kind of movie...
775840	776840	What?!
776840	779760	The other fun stuff about this movie, though...
779760	784400	Oh my God, talk about your career going downhill after, you know, news radio going off the
784400	788000	field, that's got to be made up.
788000	795240	Other stuff that they have in the movie, it says there's stuff about 9-11, they actually
795240	800680	make fun of 9-11, they make fun of school shootings, including, I guess there was one
800680	807020	scene that says an ultra-violent shocking image of an overhead shot of bloody children
807020	813680	laying in a schoolyard, and apparently, Bin Laden's one of the main characters in this,
813680	814680	so...
814680	821440	This sounds like the dumbest fucking thing in the world, I mean seriously, I mean there's
821440	826220	a difference between, like, you know, parody that's somewhat amusing, and this just sounds
826220	830000	like stupid after stupid after stupid.
830000	835560	Yeah, so, it should be interesting, I guess.
835560	838040	Okay, interesting's a good word to define, I suppose.
838040	839040	I'll see it, though.
839040	840400	I will definitely go see it.
840400	841400	Oh, God.
841400	842400	Have fun.
842400	843400	By yourself.
843400	845360	Unless you can talk Nellie into going.
845360	850800	All right, well, one thing we didn't go over in part A were the release dates, even though
850800	854240	Loki gave us some exclusives, we didn't talk about what's coming out this week, so I want
854240	857280	to start it off talking about Japanese release dates, of which, honestly, folks, there's
857280	858880	not a whole lot.
858880	863180	January was a dry month for us over here in the US, and February, at least the beginning
863180	866000	part of it, looks to be a bit slow over there in Japan.
866000	872640	We do have J-League Pro Soccer Club Otsukoru 5 coming out on February 1st.
872640	880320	So zero shikikan josentai ni, which is best hits from Taito, and I'm not sure if that's
880320	886780	a game that's actually out over here, looks like some type of old school B-52 type bomber
886780	887780	game.
887780	891320	I don't think this is a game they have over here.
891320	892440	Twin Cobra?
892440	895600	I don't think so.
895600	896600	I don't remember.
896600	898600	What's the word at the time?
898600	902720	Shikikan josentai ni.
902720	904880	Ah, whatever.
904880	906120	It's just the best hits anyway.
906120	907120	It's already out.
907120	911360	It's just going in to be a little bit cheaper, and let's see, what do we have over on the
911360	912400	Nintendo DS?
912400	914040	We do have a couple things coming out on the DS.
914040	917440	We have Monster House, which I suppose is a release a lot of folks are looking forward
917440	925420	to, as well as Bokujo Monogatari Kimi to Sodatsu Shima coming out for Marvelous Entertainment
925420	926920	as well over there in Japan.
926920	929360	And that's really about all there is to note.
929360	933720	Oh, I'm sorry, there actually is an Ys game coming out on the Sony PSP.
933720	935520	I guess that's certainly notable.
935520	936980	I love Ys.
936980	942320	The game is called Nappishitom no Hako, and it has a special edition coming out on February
942320	943320	1st.
943320	944320	Ooh.
944320	950600	Well, for our UK release dates, in February we have coming out on the first Warpath for
950600	951600	PC.
951600	957720	On the second, we have Arthur and the Invisibles for PS2, DS, PC, Game Boy Advance, Contact
957720	968080	on DS, also Dungeon Siege Throne of Agony on PSP, Europa Universalis III on PC, Ghost
968080	975200	Rider on Xbox, NFL Street 3 going to be on PSP and PlayStation 2, Sega Genesis Collection
975200	982440	on PS2, PSP, and on the fifth, Galactic Civilizations 2, but that's coming out later.
982440	987440	Anyways, for the US, there's a couple of few good things coming out this week.
987440	992000	The big one, of course, being Rogue Galaxy on PlayStation 2.
992000	996160	Brand new RPG by Level 5, you may remember Dragon Quest VIII.
996160	997160	Awesome game.
997160	999760	Reviewed pretty good from what I've seen.
999760	1005800	Civil Stations Midway is coming on PC and Xbox 360, a pretty good World War II kind
1005800	1009400	of aerial and naval combat game.
1009400	1016440	On the PC, Vanguard Saga of Heroes, and let's see here, Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation
1016440	1029740	3, Fusion Frenzy 2 on Xbox 360, City Life World Edition on the PC, and Monopoly Here
1029740	1033880	and Now on the PC.
1033880	1035760	That's about it for this week, at least.
1035760	1040080	All right, well, I wanted to mention this, and this is a little bit embarrassing because
1040080	1041080	the...
1041080	1042080	Oh, no, there it is.
1042080	1043080	Good, we got it.
1043080	1044080	The link wasn't working previously.
1044080	1046680	For some reason, I was trying to hit Blizzard Entertainment to look at this press release
1046680	1050160	that talks about World of Warcraft, The Burning Crusade.
1050160	1052760	Of course, you know that that game just came out earlier this month.
1052760	1053960	Well, get this.
1053960	1060000	It sold 2.4 million copies in the first 24 hours.
1060000	1064600	It was released simultaneously in North America, Europe, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia,
1064600	1070080	and then January 17th, Australia and New Zealand just the day after, which actually would,
1070080	1072360	because they're on the other side of the day line, but never mind.
1072360	1077280	Regardless, it came out, it sold 2.4 million copies in 24 hours.
1077280	1082420	That's pretty impressive and certainly shattered any existing PC game records that were already
1082420	1083420	out there.
1083420	1087400	So, lots of World of Warcraft addicts out there in the world, apparently.
1087400	1088400	People that were buying two or three for their families.
1088400	1089400	Are they ignoring their babies?
1089400	1090400	I don't know.
1090400	1094960	For those that only listen to us during the podcast, we have a bonus segment we do here
1094960	1099240	live that only live listeners, whether it be on All Games or Orange Wells Radio can
1099240	1100240	listen to.
1100240	1102800	Tonight, we spent like 30 minutes talking about World of Warcraft addiction, thanks
1102800	1106120	to a Tyra Banks show clip.
1106120	1108200	So that's what Jamie's making reference to.
1108200	1109200	Interesting.
1109200	1114560	Let me read a quick quote here from the co-founder of Blizzard Entertainment, Mike Morhaime.
1114560	1118720	The Burning Crusade has already exceeded even our most ambitious expectations.
1118720	1122280	We're pleased that so many players are eager to see all of the new content that the expansion
1122280	1126040	has to offer, and we look forward to seeing everyone online as additional players continue
1126040	1128720	to upgrade in the days ahead.
1128720	1130240	I still have not bought the expansion.
1130240	1132040	I won't be buying it until I hit level 40.
1132040	1135320	That's what I promised myself.
1135320	1142720	Well, there are, I think, other MMOs that might be pulling people's addiction.
1142720	1146000	There's a Lord of the Rings MMO actually has a date.
1146000	1151760	It will be launching, it's a Lord of the Rings Shadow of Angmar to be released in Europe
1151760	1157080	on the 24th of April, according to Codemasters.
1157080	1164100	The price of it actually is going to be a special pre-order rate for $99.99 that has
1164100	1168160	a lifetime membership instead of a subscription fee.
1168160	1178800	So you can either do that or pay £5.99 a month for a six month package.
1178800	1185520	But the advantage of pre-ordering it gives you early access to the game for ten days.
1185520	1190560	You can use a pre-launch character in the full game, so basically whatever you make
1190560	1193240	during this little beta is yours to hold onto.
1193240	1198120	You get a unique in-game bonus item, six Lord of the Rings online stickers, and a special
1198120	1203120	window sticker.
1203120	1206880	It seems kind of interesting.
1206880	1210600	I don't know, there's so many MMOs out there really.
1210600	1215600	Well, I'm reading some comments from chat on the previous MMO story we talked about.
1215600	1219200	Joshi16 says, Blizzard rep translation.
1219200	1223800	Money money money money, which is kind of true.
1223800	1227520	DrewNami our resident World of Warcraft addict says, I'm a rogue, I do it from behind.
1227520	1229440	Is that like on a t-shirt or something?
1229440	1231440	Yeah, that's disgusting.
1231440	1235720	And Brad from PodCulture says, I'm waiting for the Firefly MMO.
1235720	1236720	Amen!
1236720	1245760	Also, though, just to let you know, I'm on the US site for this Lord of the Rings game.
1245760	1260800	For the pre-order special that they're having on that one, when you pre-order it, you have
1260800	1264960	$199 for the lifetime thing, or $9.99 monthly.
1264960	1268440	Early access, you keep your launch care, it's the same thing really.
1268440	1272760	You get an enchanted cloak of regeneration and a ring of agility.
1272760	1280000	I had to read some of these other interesting comments.
1280000	1284000	SSJ100Matt says, dear Blizzard, since you have all this money, you wouldn't mind putting
1284000	1286760	Starcraft on DS, would you?
1286760	1291360	And Michael Doi is going to make a fan with Jamie here saying, I want a Doctor Who MMO.
1291360	1292880	Hell yeah!
1292880	1293880	I saw that coming.
1293880	1298280	I might send it for the beta for this, though.
1298280	1303320	Anyways, so before Doctor Who MMO, you're going to see something else coming from BBC.
1303320	1307560	That would be CBBC, their kid's property.
1307560	1311880	They're going to be creating an MMO based on that called CBBC World.
1311880	1318720	It's going to be aimed at kids ages 7 to 12, and it's going to kind of just be your online
1318720	1325840	MMO for kids, just like Toontown Disney thing over here.
1325840	1334360	It's going to have a bunch of custom avatars, minigames, music videos, completely lame for
1334360	1338080	anybody over the age of 12, but Jamie will still be signed up to play.
1338080	1343760	No, it's going to be like Gaia Online or something, which I quit in a day because it was boring.
1343760	1347500	You'll still play it because if it's BBC related, it might remotely have a Doctor Who
1347500	1349040	reference in it, and you'll be like...
1349040	1352280	If someone tells me for sure there's a Doctor Who reference, I'll sign up.
1352280	1356160	It'll be funny.
1356160	1359480	I only want our UK listeners to tell me.
1359480	1360480	Alright, fine.
1360480	1363560	I was going to say, in a completely unrelated note that doesn't even have to do with video
1363560	1368320	games, but I think it's kind of funny regarding the BBC, I read on some reality TV news site.
1368320	1373520	Don't ask me what I was doing reading it, but I was, that the BBC is doing a Harry Potter
1373520	1374520	reality show.
1374520	1379320	It's not called Harry Potter, but they're sending kids to Magic School, and it's going
1379320	1382840	to be like a reality show for kids in Magic School, and they actually have to do magic
1382840	1383840	tricks.
1383840	1384840	Do you mean Devil School?
1384840	1385840	No, it's Magic School.
1385840	1386840	You mean Devil School?
1386840	1387840	Yeah, I get it.
1387840	1388840	I get it.
1388840	1389840	I see what you did there.
1389840	1390840	But no, it sounds really cheesy.
1390840	1394800	But I hope they bring the show over to America, because it would be a hoot.
1394800	1395800	Magic School.
1395800	1399680	Because they get a lot of shows from Britain over here, and it should be hosted by David
1399680	1401800	Copperfield, because he's washed up anyway.
1401800	1403440	What the hell ever happened to David Copperfield?
1403440	1404440	He just disappeared.
1404440	1406840	He just made himself disappear.
1406840	1411440	Well, one game that disappeared but made a hell of a comeback, moving into some non-MMO
1411440	1414200	PC gaming news, Sam and Max.
1414200	1416520	They were gone for a long, long time, and then they came back.
1416520	1420480	They're getting new life thanks to GameTap and some of the other distribution methods
1420480	1421760	they're doing.
1421760	1426320	Episode one, Culture Shock for Sam and Max, came out in October of 2006.
1426320	1431960	Episode two came out December of 2006, and now episode three just came out on GameTap
1431960	1432960	just this past week.
1432960	1435480	It's titled The Mole, The Mob, and The Meatball.
1435480	1438840	It's going to be the third part of a six-part series.
1438840	1441080	From what I understand, I have yet to play these games myself.
1441080	1442080	I really need to.
1442080	1443080	I have a GameTap subscription.
1443080	1444720	I need to put down the wow and get into these games.
1444720	1448560	From what I understand, none of these episodes are really long.
1448560	1453760	Maybe you'll play them for four hours, depending on how much you play.
1453760	1458400	If you have to explore, if you look at Cranny or not.
1458400	1461160	It sounds kind of interesting.
1461160	1466480	You often hear about these episodic gaming, but they kind of produce one or two episodes
1466480	1467480	and then that's it.
1467480	1471200	It's kind of nice to see Sam and Max keep going at it and being very successful.
1471200	1475520	I've heard nothing but raves about the game, so I promise you I will play Sam and Max at
1475520	1479280	least part one, maybe all the way through part three, depending on how I enjoy it, before
1479280	1482400	the month's over, which doesn't give me much time.
1482400	1486660	Hopefully the series will run a little longer than the cartoon series that they had.
1486660	1490280	You can see the cartoon series on GameTap, for whatever it's worth.
1490280	1496960	Well, for our PC gamers, there's a bit of sad news.
1496960	1500400	Age of Conan has been delayed even longer.
1500400	1505680	It will be out in October, it actually will ship October 30th.
1505680	1513960	Xbox 360 version is going to be in 2008, so it'll be after that.
1513960	1516360	It looks interesting.
1516360	1519400	It looks pretty, I guess.
1519400	1523840	But you know, I think that our PC fans that have been looking forward to this, I feel
1523840	1526560	sorry that you have to wait any longer, but...
1526560	1529320	Just it doesn't look like your cup of tea, particularly.
1529320	1530320	No.
1530320	1533040	Bring on the BBC chibi game.
1533040	1534920	Hell no!
1534920	1535920	I...
1535920	1538440	I'm just messing with you.
1538440	1539440	What?
1539440	1540440	Playing Guild Wars.
1540440	1541440	Heart.
1541440	1543160	Guild Wars is pretty... are you actually playing Guild Wars?
1543160	1544400	I'll go back to Guild Wars and play one more.
1544400	1545560	If that thing hasn't expired, then yeah.
1545560	1547020	You should come play WoW with us.
1547020	1548020	Come play WoW.
1548020	1549020	Pay for my account, okay?
1549020	1550020	No.
1550020	1551020	I don't have money.
1551020	1553800	Maybe for your birthday I'll get you a card, so you can come play WoW with us.
1553800	1554800	Okay.
1554800	1555800	I'll get you a Blizzard card.
1555800	1556800	You know what they need to do?
1556800	1557800	What?
1557800	1562400	They need to have porn tycoon, because that would be the greatest game to like, you know,
1562400	1564280	run your porn, you know...
1564280	1567640	What the fuck did that have to do with anything we were just talking about?
1567640	1572080	I saw an ad for a tycoon game and I was thinking PC stuff.
1572080	1574280	I think that'd be awesome.
1574280	1577160	There could be some major money made there.
1577160	1582040	And then just come out on the DS.
1582040	1583760	Any more curveballs you want to throw at us?
1583760	1590200	Well if, you know, you're not into porn tycoon or, you know, Age of Conan, you might be interested
1590200	1593220	in Ghost Recon Advance of Warfighter 2 for the PC.
1593220	1598960	It's going to be coming out day and date with the Xbox 360 version, which is March 9th.
1598960	1605360	It's going to feature some more multiplayer stuff as well as up to 32 players online,
1605360	1609880	and more game modes, including the, you know, standard deathmatch co-op and stuff.
1609880	1612720	Plus it's just going to have a whole new storyline.
1612720	1617240	Be honest, the game looked originally kind of like the first one a lot, but, you know,
1617240	1618840	the storyline sounds pretty interesting.
1618840	1623760	Almost like they're going to do, I want to say there's like, Mexicans invading Texas
1623760	1629400	or something, and some sort of, like, they have to stave off some civil war over Mexico
1629400	1630400	and stuff.
1630400	1632360	I don't know, it was a fun game the first time around.
1632360	1635560	I cheated the whole way through it, by the way.
1635560	1636560	Surprise.
1636560	1637560	It was fun, though.
1637560	1639600	Infinite grenade launchers are awesome.
1639600	1644440	See, I knew you and your random porn tycoon outburst would stir chat.
1644440	1646360	Oh, going on in our chat room.
1646360	1650880	The Rob D. says, Loki just had his, what if it snowed in San Francisco moment?
1650880	1654880	Mechlar says, porn tycoon, first off, build a fluffer room.
1654880	1657800	Because the fluffers aren't an important part of pornography.
1657800	1660560	And then Dark Tetsuya says, I thought they made that.
1660560	1662480	It was called Playboy Mansion.
1662480	1665160	No, Playboy Mansion was lame.
1665160	1667960	How would you improve on Playboy Mansion for porn tycoon?
1667960	1673020	Um, actually make it cool and not Playboy, because Playboy, to be honest, just sucks.
1673020	1677000	They just want to be x-rated, but they're too classy for that shit, so, you know, if
1677000	1680880	it was like, you know, Penthouse Mansion or something like that, I'd be a little, you
1680880	1682400	know, step in the right direction there.
1682400	1687520	Joshi16 says, Neverland Ranch tycoon, one person buys it, guess who?
1687520	1691040	Peter Pan?
1691040	1697480	All right, well, you know, I think the tycoon series is one of those series that has just
1697480	1703920	been done over and over and over to death, but GamesRadar.com would disagree because
1703920	1709840	they posted their list of the top seven series run into the ground this week.
1709840	1714640	And this, of course, would be games that, you know, they were popular and then things
1714640	1718320	just start to kind of go wrong with the series.
1718320	1720360	So have you guys seen this list already?
1720360	1722200	Loki, Jamie, have you guys seen the list already?
1722200	1723200	Yeah.
1723200	1724680	Okay, Loki, Jamie, have you read this list already?
1724680	1728120	Okay, what would you think would be on this list, besides Tomb Raider, which is up on
1728120	1729280	the screen right now?
1729280	1733400	What games do you think, number seven is Tomb Raider, what series do you think have just
1733400	1735840	been run into the ground?
1735840	1737320	Remakes of Final Fantasy VII.
1737320	1739320	Okay, well, let's see if it shows up.
1739320	1742680	All right, number seven is Tomb Raider.
1742680	1747320	Number six is Mega Man, because, I mean, really, I mean, there's been all those stinking battle
1747320	1751320	network games, but there was, you know, there was never really a Mega Man 9.
1751320	1755760	Mega Man X games kind of ended in 2004, and so, you know, Mega Man's just kind of been
1755760	1756880	done to death.
1756880	1759480	They need a resurgence of Mega Man, I think.
1759480	1762040	Viewtiful Joe is at number five, which I think is an interesting selection.
1762040	1764240	They had like two or three games for that series.
1764240	1765240	That's hardly run into the ground.
1765240	1767060	But were any of them as good as the first one?
1767060	1770560	But they, you know, to be honest, though, they may not have been as good as the first
1770560	1775280	one, but it's like, it's, you have to kind of take off to run it into the ground, you
1775280	1776280	know what I mean?
1776280	1780520	GamesRadar cites Red Hot Rumble, which was a Smash Brothers type fighter game that had
1780520	1783360	Viewtiful Joe characters in it.
1783360	1785440	Number four was Dynasty Warriors.
1785440	1789560	That game, every single Dynasty Warriors game is exactly the same as the one before it.
1789560	1794040	And then they keep doing this fucking Empire shit, which is exactly the same game all over
1794040	1795040	again.
1795040	1799880	Number three is Tenchu, and they cite the PSP version, as this has just been done too
1799880	1800880	much now.
1800880	1801880	Who cares?
1801880	1804760	I mean, that game, I don't, there's still not that many games.
1804760	1805760	Number two is Spy Hunter.
1805760	1806760	I agree with this.
1806760	1809560	Okay, there's been like three games in that series, or four.
1809560	1812520	But seriously, it was, it was gone for the longest time.
1812520	1815960	You had Spy Hunter and then a forgettable sequel in the arcades, and then it was gone
1815960	1819180	forever, and then suddenly Midway decided to make this resurgence out of it, and it's
1819180	1821080	not been anything to scream about.
1821080	1822080	Right?
1822080	1823080	Okay.
1823080	1825760	Alright, well that's why they say they run it into the ground.
1825760	1833360	They cite Spy Hunter 2 and Spy Hunter Nowhere to Run, three games by three different developers.
1833360	1838480	The number one series they say has been run into the ground, Sonic the Hedgehog, the number
1838480	1839480	one series.
1839480	1846920	And of course they cite the GBA port of the original that was god-awful, in 2006 Rivals
1846920	1849000	and Riders, which weren't that great.
1849000	1853240	Of course this new one that's god-awful, they say the last truly good Sonic game according
1853240	1858480	to GamesRadar, Sonic Rush back in 2005 was the last good one.
1858480	1861080	You know what I think is interesting though?
1861080	1864480	I know a lot of folks out there think we're Nintendo fanboys and girls here on this program,
1864480	1869400	and to some extent, you know, we are a little bit, but hasn't Mario had some pretty shitty
1869400	1870400	games too?
1870400	1871400	Yeah.
1871400	1873440	Did you ever play Mario is Missing?
1873440	1874680	That was a PC game though.
1874680	1877560	No, it was, there was a version on Super Nintendo that was pretty awful.
1877560	1880200	Luigi's Mansion, not that great.
1880200	1882160	A lot of people didn't like Mario Sunshine.
1882160	1887680	I thought it was pretty good myself, but a lot of folks didn't like it for whatever reason.
1887680	1889720	Why is Mario getting a buy out of all this?
1889720	1894880	I mean, I guess, I don't know, maybe because Mario 64 was pretty rad and some of the new
1894880	1897920	Super Mario Brothers, but I don't know, it kind of seems like some people get a buy out
1897920	1899360	of this.
1899360	1901440	There's been some pretty shitty Mario games.
1901440	1902440	Yeah.
1902440	1903440	So I don't know.
1903440	1905080	Mario is Missing.
1905080	1907080	What about Donkey Kong?
1907080	1910800	Oh, that Mario vs. Donkey Kong, well those games are okay.
1910800	1912360	No, I meant just Donkey Kong stuff.
1912360	1913360	I mean, the Donkey Kong Country series.
1913360	1915360	Donkey Kong Country got rammed into the ground.
1915360	1919480	It was okay, but then they had a stupid fucking Bongo shit, and then, I don't know.
1919480	1920800	I don't know, the Bongo games were interesting.
1920800	1926240	Yeah, but then they had those other ones where you had to use the Bongos to move up a, what
1926240	1930120	was that one where you had to basically just use the L and R buttons on it?
1930120	1931120	I don't know.
1931120	1934200	I think a lot of the franchises out there kind of suck.
1934200	1937320	Ooh, Rama made a good one that these guys left off the list.
1937320	1939620	Don't forget Spyro.
1939620	1942400	That's a great one that should have been on the list.
1942400	1943400	Good catch, Rama.
1943400	1945040	Or Crash Bandicoot.
1945040	1948080	Those are both really good ones.
1948080	1949120	Let's see, what else do we have?
1949120	1952800	The Rob D says, yeah, but the last real Mario game came out 11 years ago.
1952800	1954520	That would depend on what you consider a real Mario game.
1954520	1955520	How about Rampage?
1955520	1957520	Oh, that's a good one, too.
1957520	1961080	See, we should come up with our own list, and of course, Jeremy Todd once says Metal
1961080	1962080	Slug.
1962080	1963080	Actually.
1963080	1964080	What about Contra?
1964080	1969000	It's been a while since we had a Contra game, hasn't it?
1969000	1970000	No, last year.
1970000	1971000	Well, besides the arcade.
1971000	1972000	Really?
1972000	1975320	Well, I meant like 2005.
1975320	1976320	We had Shattered...
1976320	1978320	Wait, not Shattered Soldier.
1978320	1981360	Damn, I don't remember the last one.
1981360	1984560	Vidpowah says, I admit I had a blast with the Mario is Missing games.
1984560	1986000	Well, I'm glad someone enjoyed it.
1986000	1987000	Ninja Turtle games.
1987000	1988000	Oh, good one.
1988000	1993960	See, we got some really good ones here, but the list wasn't so bad as it was.
1993960	1997720	All right, well, another thing that's not so bad is reading your emails that we get
1997720	1998720	every week.
1998720	2002080	We rather enjoy it, and DarkSakura is queen of the mailbag, and when you send your emails
2002080	2006600	to mailbag at orangelaungerator.com, DarkSakura will read and often respond to your emails
2006600	2011120	and pick some of her favorites to read here on the program, again, because we do get quite
2011120	2012120	a few letters.
2012120	2014080	We can't read them all, but we can try.
2014080	2018480	So DarkSakura is going to open up the mailbag and dive on in and see what we've got to read
2018480	2019480	this week.
2019480	2023200	DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag this week?
2023200	2028240	Two emails.
2028240	2029240	That's it?
2029240	2030240	Yeah.
2030240	2031240	All right.
2031240	2032240	Well, let's do it.
2032240	2033240	Okay.
2033240	2034240	First one.
2034240	2035240	Salutations, O.L.R.
2035240	2036240	Cast.
2036240	2038600	I just had a question about the Nintendo Wii and if its games contain region coding.
2038600	2039600	Thanks for reading this.
2039600	2043440	Also, I don't know if you guys heard about this article, but someone tried to electrocute
2043440	2045340	themselves with an arcade machine.
2045340	2049240	Their Pac-Man high score was beaten, and he claimed that he had nothing left to live for,
2049240	2052120	so he attempted suicide with a Pac-Man machine.
2052120	2054120	Pretty weird, though.
2054120	2056520	Comes from Blue Zenith.
2056520	2059240	He should have just tipped the machine over on himself.
2059240	2060240	That wouldn't kill anybody.
2060240	2064640	I've had an arcade machine fall on me.
2064640	2065640	First of all...
2065640	2068440	Did it hit you in the head?
2068440	2070800	Because that might explain some stuff.
2070800	2073040	Teasing just heart.
2073040	2074440	I'm letting you buy me dinner.
2074440	2079960	You can make it up to me with potato pancakes.
2079960	2082340	My car is dead.
2082340	2083340	As for the Wii...
2083340	2084760	Would you like a nice cup?
2084760	2086760	Would you like me to bring you a cup of wham?
2086760	2091960	Rob, I'm trying to do emails, so you can shut up, okay?
2091960	2092960	All.
2092960	2093960	Own.
2093960	2094960	Okay.
2094960	2095960	Jamie.
2095960	2096960	Jamie.
2096960	2097960	Jamie.
2097960	2098960	Jamie.
2098960	2104920	So at any rate, the Nintendo Wii is definitely region coded, so yeah.
2104920	2105920	But they're working on it.
2105920	2106920	They're working on it.
2106920	2114080	And also about someone killing themselves over a score.
2114080	2115920	Darwin loves them.
2115920	2120440	Sorry, that type of person should be removed from the dream pool.
2120440	2123040	Moving forward to the next and last email.
2123040	2129600	A pretty long one coming to us from someone who has not signed the email, so I'm just
2129600	2131600	going to say JCK.
2131600	2134800	Hey guys, great show.
2134800	2136920	Just wanted to give some feedback.
2136920	2139180	Two news items on last week's show.
2139180	2145680	The Dallas Area TV Network's WFAA's report on the PS3 and Wii as a gateway to porn, and
2145680	2146680	the New York State Bill...
2146680	2147680	Really?
2147680	2148680	They're giving away porn on the PS3?
2148680	2149680	Now I'll buy one.
2149680	2150680	Hey Rob, shut up.
2150680	2157860	And the New York State Bill A00547, and later the A02024, prohibiting the sale of certain
2157860	2158860	games to minors.
2158860	2161560	Do you want to read the email, though, if you really want to talk?
2161560	2162560	No, no, I'm fine.
2162560	2165080	I'm going to go get more coffee for my Hello Kitty maker.
2165080	2166080	Okay.
2166080	2169600	There are two kinds of parents, those who accept that the world is hostile and their
2169600	2175280	children must be proactively educated or sheltered, and those who want the world to be safe so
2175280	2179960	that their children will be sheltered naturally with a minimum of parental involvement.
2179960	2183220	Most parents are lazy and fall into the second category.
2183220	2187120	There are ones who are technophobic and will not take the time to investigate parental
2187120	2189160	controls on hardware and software.
2189160	2195240	They are the ones who seek to censor and control every content distribution chain.
2195240	2198480	The problem is that the world cannot be made safe, even if we could agree on what safe
2198480	2200840	is without oppressing sub-subculture somewhere.
2200840	2204360	It is impossible for any of us to remake the world in our own image.
2204360	2209440	We have to accept that things that we don't like exist, that our children will stumble
2209440	2214400	onto them if we don't shelter them or otherwise prepare them for that initial contact.
2214400	2218480	I may not agree with the religious conservatives who homeschool their kids and filter their
2218480	2221420	TV, but at least they're active parents.
2221420	2224400	There are legal issues that surround the New York Bills.
2224400	2226400	First of all, who decides what is objectionable?
2226400	2229960	The ESRB and MPAA are private industry bodies.
2229960	2234560	We cannot pass a law that deputizes these private bodies to rate things, which is why
2234560	2238840	a law that limits the sale of M or AO games is unenforceable.
2238840	2242800	If the government seeks to control, it must create a government body to identify what
2242800	2244060	to control.
2244060	2248000	Every ratings scheme in the U.S. is voluntary, the music industry chooses to use parental
2248000	2255200	advisory, the music industry chooses to get MPAA ratings, and the gaming industry chooses
2255200	2257060	to submit to the ESRB.
2257060	2262160	The public pressure is on retail distribution chains to comply with what forces the content
2262160	2267360	creators to adhere, which is why every major game retailer already checks ID.
2267360	2270960	The system works and there is no reason to change it.
2270960	2273240	And that's the end of the email.
2273240	2274240	Yes?
2274240	2277840	I got nothing.
2277840	2295640	I have a whole problem with the government being way too involved in our personal lives.
2295640	2308080	I think that it is unreasonable to expect somebody else to do to protect their children
2308080	2312960	from influences there are really no way to control.
2312960	2317240	It is your job, I'm sorry, it is a person's job as a parent to prepare their child for
2317240	2318360	the real world.
2318360	2323680	I've seen what's become of people who are too sheltered, they usually end up with severe
2323680	2329880	social problems.
2329880	2338480	The reference to the homeschool religious fundamentalist, a friend of mine that I met
2338480	2346680	here when I moved out to California, she had been so sheltered, she actually didn't go
2346680	2357660	to school until she was in high school and thought that oral sex was talking about sex.
2357660	2363200	I knew someone who thought the F word was fart.
2363200	2368420	And so when confronted with the reality of their ignorance, you know, who's to blame
2368420	2372640	but their parents, you know, keeping them from the stuff that's going on in the real
2372640	2373640	world.
2373640	2381160	To go back to the statement regarding needing a governmental body to participate with a
2381160	2389080	government controlled law, I guess it's the government controlled, that's not redundant.
2389080	2396480	I understand the logic in that but I still think that if we have a private party that
2396480	2404640	is not involved in the government, we are likely to get less, I would say, bias.
2404640	2409120	I'm sorry, our government is bought and paid for, you know.
2409120	2416480	For every person that you elect into government positions, there's a lobbyist behind them
2416480	2422600	paying lots of money for them to say, you know, I think that cigarettes are okay.
2422600	2426680	Is that why Travis is running for president?
2426680	2427680	I don't know.
2427680	2428680	I don't know either.
2428680	2430440	I was just putting that out there.
2430440	2435460	So I actually think that it is better for us to have that separation with those facilities
2435460	2436920	and the government.
2436920	2441440	I think the law is unnecessary and I agree, unenforceable the way it is in its current
2441440	2442440	incarnation.
2442440	2447320	All right, well I read through the email while you were ranting there and it was well thought
2447320	2448320	out.
2448320	2449680	I like getting those thoughtful emails.
2449680	2452480	I love when people with brains email us.
2452480	2456000	All right, so you should email us too, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
2456000	2457000	And please be smart.
2457000	2461400	Oh, dude, we got another email just as I was closing the box.
2461400	2464080	They're already smart because they listen to this program.
2464080	2471040	I'm going to read this now because it's by NintendoManiac64, worth a thousand words dot
2471040	2474160	com, an entry into this internet porn tycoon.
2474160	2476160	Oh, I get it.
2476160	2480400	They've got a picture of that of somebody had already done this on this worth a thousand
2480400	2481400	dot com.
2481400	2484440	Somebody photoshopped railroad tycoons, this internet porn tycoon.
2484440	2485440	There you go.
2485440	2486440	That's awesome.
2486440	2487440	Yeah.
2487440	2488440	Thank you for sharing that with us, NintendoManiac64.
2488440	2490440	Too bad it's not real.
2490440	2491440	I know.
2491440	2493120	Well, I can only hope.
2493120	2496440	By microprobe, that's fantastic.
2496440	2498960	That was, oh microprobes was the one that made it originally.
2498960	2500960	I see what they did there.
2500960	2502600	Yay, Photoshop.
2502600	2508400	Anyways, so in the past PlayStation portable firmware has been defeated by Grand Theft
2508400	2516280	Auto Liberty City Stories, and of course Sony went and apparently fixed the hole, or so
2516280	2518000	they thought.
2518000	2523080	Now people have found another way using Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, one of the
2523080	2527600	original copies, that you can once again break the firmware.
2527600	2528600	What have they done?
2528600	2529640	Yep, they've done it.
2529640	2535720	They've made their wonderful Hello World proof of concept thing, and even today, which just
2535720	2541480	got released, a downgrader for firmware 3.03, so try as you might Sony, you'll just never
2541480	2542480	win.
2542480	2543600	Never, ever.
2543600	2547720	So this is why consoles shouldn't have firmwares.
2547720	2552480	They should just be good to go instead of having to upgrade.
2552480	2554820	What's the big deal about homebrew on the PSP anyway?
2554820	2556160	Is it really that bad?
2556160	2558080	Is it really killing families across America?
2558080	2561040	Is it really something that has to be prevented at all costs?
2561040	2562040	No.
2562040	2564720	In fact, they're encouraging it on the PlayStation 3, but that's still been...
2564720	2568200	People are going to pirate the, you know, they're going to break the firmware to pirate
2568200	2569200	shit, so...
2569200	2572720	I was reading somewhere else that HD DVD, of course, you know, they finally had to admit
2572720	2574240	that yes, it's been cracked.
2574240	2575240	Hey Rob.
2575240	2576240	What?
2576240	2578440	This kick to your ass is courtesy of DMN.
2578440	2579440	What?
2579440	2580440	Yep.
2580440	2583200	Tell DMN to go suck on a...
2583200	2587160	Anyway, I wanted to just say really quickly, and then we're going to get into the Skype
2587160	2590600	line and hear what you guys have to say, and play a voicemail.
2590600	2592400	We got one voicemail this week that's pretty interesting.
2592400	2593400	I want you guys to hear it.
2593400	2595160	I want to say this real quickly.
2595160	2600600	You might remember when Halo 2 was first coming out and was being promoted very heavily, they
2600600	2605840	used a viral site to promote it, and it was called ilovebees.com was the name of the site.
2605840	2606840	Well, guess what?
2606840	2612000	It's back, and kind of convenient, don't you think, because Halo 3 is coming out before
2612000	2616200	too long, and the beta is happening pretty soon?
2616200	2617200	Makes you think.
2617200	2618200	But bees are great.
2618200	2619200	Well, if you love bees...
2619200	2621880	They give us honey and sting us.
2621880	2623760	And then they die when they sting you.
2623760	2625680	If you love bees, check out the site.
2625680	2626680	It's ilovebees.com.
2626680	2630660	All right, we're going to get into the Skype line and take some of your calls here live
2630660	2634480	on Orange Lounge Radio, but first, I want to play a voicemail that came into our line
2634480	2637600	this week, and of course, we always invite your voicemails on any topic.
2637600	2642920	You can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR when we're not live, or for those of you guys
2642920	2645880	outside the US or Canada where that number is toll free, you can always give us a call
2645880	2647300	on the Skype line.
2647300	2650640	Just download Skype and call username Orange Lounge Radio.
2650640	2653800	That's us, and you can leave us a message throughout the week, but keep in mind if you
2653800	2655640	call right now, you're probably going to get on the Skype line.
2655640	2658160	We'll take you live on air, but if you're the type that likes to formulate your thoughts
2658160	2663260	first and then leave us a voicemail, you can do that, or sometimes we get other craziness
2663260	2667040	on our voicemail line, and I mean craziness, so check this out, because this is pretty
2667040	2668040	crazy.
2668040	2670600	You might have to listen kind of carefully, because they talk fast, because you can definitely
2670600	2673440	sense there's a lot of excitement in the room, so check this out.
2673440	2675680	Hey, Rob, it's me.
2675680	2678680	I just finished the free spot call, so it was awesome.
2678680	2680680	It was a surprise for you, hold on.
2680680	2682680	Yeah, Rob, this is Sheriff for Free Spot.
2682680	2683680	What's going on, man?
2683680	2684680	Adam and I are just chatting, and we're like, wait, what is this?
2684680	2685680	Is he going to show up tonight?
2685680	2686680	I don't know.
2686680	2687680	We don't know.
2687680	2688680	Is he going to fly in?
2688680	2689680	I don't know.
2689680	2690680	Is he going to fly in tonight?
2690680	2691680	I don't know.
2691680	2692680	We're looking for helicopters, you know, here.
2692680	2693680	Anyway, this is Sheriff for Free Spot.
2693680	2694680	Hope you're doing well.
2694680	2695680	Rock out.
2695680	2696680	Have a good time.
2696680	2697680	Guitar Hero, Fun Times, Anime.
2697680	2698680	Good times all around, yeah.
2698680	2699680	Free spot.
2699680	2700680	Go, go, go.
2700680	2701680	Here's Adam again.
2701680	2702680	He's got something he has to say.
2702680	2703680	Enjoy your voice, man.
2703680	2708680	I'll be listening to him on Sunday, live in the chat later.
2708680	2709680	Thanks, hold on.
2709680	2713880	Okay, let me translate, because those guys talked faster than the Micro Machines guy.
2713880	2718480	That apparently was Sean from Freeze Pop leaving the message, because Rama went to the concert
2718480	2722480	in New York City the other night and got them to leave a message.
2722480	2725200	He texted me on my phone while I was in school.
2725200	2726200	That's funny.
2726200	2731680	See, sometimes we get craziness on the voicemail line, so I encourage you folks, program the
2731680	2734600	1-877-GAME-OLR into your cell phone.
2734600	2740560	When you come across internet celebrities such as this guy from Freeze Pop, then you
2740560	2747080	should have them call in and leave us crazy voicemails, because, you know, that's fun.
2747080	2750720	All right, we're going to open up our Skype line.
2750720	2756120	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or its username, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
2756120	2760600	We want to offer up you guys to interact with our program here on Orange Lounge Radio, because
2760600	2763240	you know, it doesn't have to be all about us.
2763240	2764240	I mean, to some extent.
2764240	2765240	It could be all about me.
2765240	2768760	To some extent it does have to be all about us, but we want it to be about you guys as
2768760	2769760	well.
2769760	2774400	So give us a call right now on the Skype line and we'll take some calls.
2774400	2775720	Let's start off with this call tonight.
2775720	2779200	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
2779200	2780200	This is D.M.N.
2780200	2781760	San's really crappy microphone.
2781760	2782760	Hi, D.M.N.
2782760	2784160	San's really crappy microphone.
2784160	2787600	Hey, I'm going to kick your ass next time I see you.
2787600	2789600	Bring it, motherfucker.
2789600	2790600	What?
2790600	2797240	Oh, wow, I'm just reading in the chatroom, apparently 2DX Gold is supposed to be at Konami
2797240	2799680	Gamers' Day, which we're going to next week.
2799680	2800680	That's pretty hot.
2800680	2801680	Oh, really?
2801680	2802680	I don't know where the hell that came from.
2802680	2805400	Somebody just blurted that out in chat.
2805400	2806760	Can somebody back that up?
2806760	2807760	I wouldn't doubt it.
2807760	2808760	Oh, no, I see.
2808760	2812280	Mecklar, oh, and 2DX Gold is going over to America, left the UK a day ago.
2812280	2813600	Not sure where it's going, though.
2813600	2817040	You guys got any big conventions or game shows soon, and Jason put it together that it must
2817040	2819200	be coming over to Konami Gamers' Day.
2819200	2820200	It's pretty hot.
2820200	2821200	It's coming to Sakura Con.
2821200	2822200	That's where it's going.
2822200	2823200	I'm so planning to go spread your socks.
2823200	2824200	We'll see what happens.
2824200	2825200	I don't know.
2825200	2826200	I don't know what's going to happen.
2826200	2827800	We're going to have a full report on Konami Gamers' Day next week, and keep an eye on
2827800	2831560	our website Thursday and Friday.
2831560	2834960	All the news that we get there is embargoed until a certain time, but the minute that
2834960	2839000	embargo's up, we're going to post a ton of shit from the show, so we're really excited.
2839000	2842280	Anyway, D.M.N., what's on your mind tonight?
2842280	2843280	Three things.
2843280	2847560	One, huge STFU announcement this coming week.
2847560	2849400	This is your Thursday night program, yes?
2849400	2850400	Yes.
2850400	2851760	Not this week, but next week.
2851760	2855760	We're going to have MC Frontalot on the show for five good minutes.
2855760	2856960	I hate you!
2856960	2858920	No you don't.
2858920	2859920	I knew Jamie would be pissed.
2859920	2864160	Tell him to say something for me and record it, please.
2864160	2865760	How about we Skype you in?
2865760	2866760	You can talk to him.
2866760	2867760	I have school.
2867760	2869840	I have no problem with that.
2869840	2871440	When are you guys taping it?
2871440	2872440	Because you don't do it live.
2872440	2873440	When are you guys taping it?
2873440	2874440	I don't know.
2874440	2877760	I don't know if you posted, but I'll kick Jimmy to the curb and you can interview with
2877760	2878760	me.
2878760	2879760	There you go.
2879760	2882080	I have school every night this week, dude.
2882080	2883080	It's not this week.
2883080	2884080	It's next week.
2884080	2885080	Oh.
2885080	2888240	Why don't your people talk to his people and see what you can come up with?
2888240	2889240	My people will talk to your people.
2889240	2890240	All right.
2890240	2891240	Maybe we can get him on this show.
2891240	2893200	Well, anyway, so that's exciting news for you guys.
2893200	2895160	You guys are getting more celebrities than we are.
2895160	2896160	What the fuck?
2896160	2900000	We've been around for five years.
2900000	2904840	You guys are on like nine weeks and you're having frickin'... fuck you.
2904840	2905840	All right.
2905840	2907480	I love you too, Rob.
2907480	2909440	Did you just call to rub it in or is there anything else you want to share?
2909440	2910440	No.
2910440	2911440	I actually had two things.
2911440	2915600	One, I have a review of Bookworm Adventures.
2915600	2917640	Dude, Bookworm Adventures is awesome.
2917640	2918640	Yes.
2918640	2919640	Dude, you're almost playing that.
2919640	2924040	Pretty much the greatest casual game ever made.
2924040	2925880	That's what Xbox Live needs.
2925880	2929840	It's 30 bucks for the full version and that sounds kind of steep.
2929840	2931200	I would play that.
2931200	2932200	So I have a keyboard?
2932200	2933760	Yeah, but not everyone does.
2933760	2937880	Well, fuck them.
2937880	2939440	It's 30 bucks for the full version.
2939440	2942640	It's a bit steep, but very much worth it.
2942640	2944840	Exciting.
2944840	2947960	Is there any particular reason you love Bookworm Adventures?
2947960	2950680	Is it the smarts you get to use in constructing words?
2950680	2951680	Is it the graphics?
2951680	2953360	What is it about the game?
2953360	2956440	It's that and it's the charm.
2956440	2961240	The game makes this really crazy deep voice like a voiceover guy.
2961240	2963400	If you beat the crap out of an enemy, it's like CRUSHED.
2963400	2965400	It's pretty cool.
2965400	2970160	Can you do that one more time, please?
2970160	2971160	CRUSHED.
2971160	2972160	That's pretty awesome.
2972160	2975120	Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, DMN?
2975120	2976520	Yeah, bonus segment.
2976520	2977720	I wanted to talk about that.
2977720	2983440	I know the podcast listeners didn't hear it, but I actually can totally sympathize with
2983440	2988440	that one lady because I just broke up with my girlfriend over WoW.
2988440	2989440	Really?
2989440	2994520	I remember calling her or you or the both of you during Guys on a Show one night.
2994520	2998400	No, it wasn't Guys on a Show, it was this show when I was really fucking plastic.
2998400	2999400	Oh, that's right.
2999400	3000400	When you called in here drunk.
3000400	3003320	So, you guys broke up over WoW?
3003320	3004320	What happened?
3004320	3005320	Over WoW.
3005320	3012600	Well, one, I came over to visit her several weeks ago and she decided that playing WoW
3012600	3017320	and raiding was more important than spending time with me and that kind of pissed me off.
3017320	3021680	And then I called her earlier this week to see if she wanted to do something and she's
3021680	3023840	like, no, I'm playing Burning Crusade, I'm trying to get 70.
3023840	3025620	I'm like, okay, you know what?
3025620	3026620	That's it.
3026620	3028200	I'm done with this shit.
3028200	3029200	What do you want?
3029200	3032080	Do you want level 70 or cock?
3032080	3033080	You need to make a decision.
3033080	3035360	Is that what you told her?
3035360	3039960	Just like, you know, you find WoW more important than, you know, hanging out with me and I
3039960	3043120	care about you and I do all this shit for you.
3043120	3044440	That's how I would break it down.
3044440	3048720	I would say, you know, if I was having this problem in a relationship, I would say, look,
3048720	3055160	do you want level 70 or do you want the cock because you can't have both.
3055160	3058200	I game and I get laid when I want it.
3058200	3059200	All right.
3059200	3060300	Well, aren't you?
3060300	3061880	That's because you married a nerd.
3061880	3062880	Yes, I did.
3062880	3063880	It's great.
3063880	3064880	All right.
3064880	3065880	DMN, anything else you want to share?
3065880	3066880	We got to let some other people on.
3066880	3067880	You need to tell Robbie Parks like an asshole.
3067880	3071520	Yeah, Rob, your parking sucks.
3071520	3072520	Really?
3072520	3073520	Why does my parking suck?
3073520	3074520	Okay.
3074520	3075520	When I was down...
3075520	3076520	Oops.
3076520	3077520	We lost the connection.
3077520	3084400	If you would like to call us, our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype or you can give
3084400	3085400	us a call.
3085400	3090560	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3090560	3092280	That's toll free in the United States.
3092280	3094840	Hey, Rob, can't hang up on me.
3094840	3096960	No, but I can unplug your mic.
3096960	3100320	Yeah, and I can steal yours and beat you in the head with it.
3100320	3101320	What was that, Jamie?
3101320	3102320	No, you...
3102320	3103320	Nope.
3103320	3104320	Ow, ow.
3104320	3109840	Damn it, her mic is like hardwired in that fucking mix board.
3109840	3115560	That's because my powerful, awesome voice has fused it there.
3115560	3117520	I totally owned Rob.
3117520	3118520	Whatever.
3118520	3122200	I'm sorry if I broke your arm.
3122200	3123200	You hurt.
3123200	3125200	You'll just have to give me a free massage.
3125200	3132160	You'll just have to give me a free massage from MassageTheRapist.com.
3132160	3133160	Rob!
3133160	3137080	I take my professions seriously.
3137080	3140920	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3140920	3141920	Who's this?
3141920	3142920	Legend of Zaku.
3142920	3143920	Hi, Legend of Zaku.
3143920	3145920	What's on your mind, buddy?
3145920	3152200	All that 2DX stuff that I've been hearing from over the pond.
3152200	3153200	Over the pond?
3153200	3157680	Yeah, that whole Ghostbusters thing that kind of shocked us last week.
3157680	3158680	Remember?
3158680	3161320	Yeah, yeah, okay.
3161320	3162320	What about it?
3162320	3166560	No, I'm just saying, you know, from what I've been hearing, Konami Gamers Day might have
3166560	3167560	gold.
3167560	3168560	I don't...
3168560	3169560	I just want, you know...
3169560	3170560	You know what?
3170560	3171560	You know what?
3171560	3176360	I'm not going to this event to, you know, to play all the cool stuff.
3176360	3179940	I'm going to, you know, hear what is coming out so I can report back to all you guys what
3179940	3180940	sounds cool.
3180940	3181940	Exactly.
3181940	3182940	If it's there, it's there.
3182940	3183940	Loki will, too.
3183940	3186880	Dark Soccer, unfortunately, is unable to attend because of school, but we'll give you our
3186880	3190000	thoughts.
3190000	3195640	You also know that Betsun mentioned in a press release that they're supposed to be having,
3195640	3196640	you know...
3196640	3200400	One of their top guys said that they're supposed to be having a content update for Supernova
3200400	3203600	that's supposed to have two to three hundred more songs into it.
3203600	3207600	Two to three hundred more songs than DDR Supernova in the arcade?
3207600	3209080	Show Betsun press release.
3209080	3210080	Wow.
3210080	3211480	Well, who knows?
3211480	3212680	This could be something they're announcing.
3212680	3215640	I think Konami's gearing up for lots of announcements this week.
3215640	3219520	They've been kind of quiet, so I think we're going to get just blasted with stuff.
3219520	3223560	I think if that is true, you'll hear about it Thursday.
3223560	3228480	If you don't hear about it then, or Friday, I don't know when the news is embargoed, but
3228480	3233240	Thursday or Friday, if you don't hear after that, it probably wasn't true.
3233240	3234960	But I could do it right now.
3234960	3235960	Watch.
3235960	3236960	I'll post it up on chat.
3236960	3237960	Yeah.
3237960	3238960	There we go.
3238960	3244720	Well, okay, but how often are things talked about that don't necessarily happen, such
3244720	3246560	as Link Mode?
3246560	3250360	Well, that was never the best since its fall.
3250360	3254600	That was because they got shafted by the people that were supposed to make the part for them.
3254600	3260160	And so, you know, I was disappointed at first, but I let that slide because obviously, you
3260160	3263580	know, I have faith that Konami might find another way.
3263580	3265440	But if they don't, so be it.
3265440	3268480	I mean, they'll eventually find an alternative.
3268480	3272320	I mean, now, right now, probably in the next.
3272320	3273320	Right.
3273320	3276200	You've been playing anything else besides Bomani lately?
3276200	3279440	More on the Groove R21, and I just played Drummania today.
3279440	3280440	Okay, let me rephrase.
3280440	3284880	Have you been playing anything that is not a music game?
3284880	3286280	I started playing Initial D today.
3286280	3287280	All right.
3287280	3288280	There you go.
3288280	3289280	That's something.
3289280	3290280	And in the arcade?
3290280	3291280	Yeah.
3291280	3292280	I bought the card and everything.
3292280	3293280	How is that?
3293280	3294880	Is there a lot of competition in your neck of the woods?
3294880	3297240	I actually traveled out of state today.
3297240	3299960	It was a tournament, so I managed to play, you know.
3299960	3304080	In addition to other stuff, I just played, you know, I managed to get into Initial D
3304080	3305080	while I was at it.
3305080	3306080	So yeah.
3306080	3312920	I mean, it wasn't that much, but it's really hard to find an Initial D machine in Chinatown
3312920	3313920	anyways.
3313920	3317440	I know one place, but I will make efforts to follow up on that.
3317440	3318440	All right.
3318440	3319440	All right.
3319440	3322480	Well, Zaku, your voice is breaking up a little bit, but thanks so much for calling in, as
3322480	3323480	you always do.
3323480	3325480	And we'll talk to you another time already.
3325480	3326480	All right.
3326480	3333840	If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or it's username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
3333840	3337320	If you're sick of the same old people calling in week after week, then you're not helping,
3337320	3340480	because you're not calling us, so you should get on your telephone and give us a call right
3340480	3341480	now.
3341480	3342480	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3342480	3345680	Otherwise, it's going to be the same people get through every week.
3345680	3350840	Or you can always leave us a voicemail, because I know some folks can't listen live on Sunday,
3350840	3354480	and so they want to, you know, interact with us in other ways.
3354480	3356640	I guess we'll do one more call.
3356640	3359320	We'll go over to this one.
3359320	3360720	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3360720	3361720	Who's this?
3361720	3362720	It's Rama.
3362720	3363720	What's up?
3363720	3364720	How you guys doing?
3364720	3365720	Hey, Rama.
3365720	3366720	How you doing, baby?
3366720	3367720	You've already been on the show today.
3367720	3368720	Hi.
3368720	3369720	Your voicemail.
3369720	3370720	Well, I do.
3370720	3371720	I can't help the show out.
3371720	3372720	You know me.
3372720	3373720	I love you guys and girls.
3373720	3374720	I know.
3374720	3375720	It was cool.
3375720	3376720	Thanks a lot.
3376720	3377720	That's fun.
3377720	3378720	You know, we had FreezePop.
3378720	3381200	At least we had Casson from FreezePop about a year ago on the show, and it was very nice.
3381200	3383200	I wish them a lot of success.
3383200	3384680	They're a good bunch.
3384680	3385680	Sweetness.
3385680	3390800	I also hope you like the voice while I left it on your personal line.
3390800	3391800	You know what?
3391800	3393800	It cut out.
3393800	3394800	What was it supposed to be?
3394800	3397480	Because, like, I heard, like, a couple notes, like, they were playing a song.
3397480	3400760	Like, it sounded like they were starting to play a song, but it cut, like, you were obviously
3400760	3402000	indoors because it cut out.
3402000	3404680	What were you trying to leave?
3404680	3406160	Let's talk more rock.
3406160	3407160	Ah, okay.
3407160	3409160	See, all I could hear, like, this is the voicemail.
3409160	3412160	It was like, this is for you, Rob.
3412160	3416120	And then that's all I could hear, and then it, like, went, you know, cell phone drop.
3416120	3418840	You might need to switch carriers.
3418840	3421400	Because when we played that, there were a few people that showed up with their Guitar
3421400	3422400	Hero controllers.
3422400	3425600	They moved towards the front and started, like, freestyling on the song.
3425600	3428600	People showed up with their Guitar Hero controller to the FreezePop concert?
3428600	3429600	Yes.
3429600	3433720	One of my friends, Aaron, he got them to sign his controller.
3433720	3434720	That's pretty hardcore.
3434720	3435720	I like that, though.
3435720	3436720	That's rad.
3436720	3437720	Yeah.
3437720	3438720	Definitely.
3438720	3439720	All right.
3439720	3440720	Well, anything else you want to share with us, Rama?
3440720	3442280	Did you have a good time at the concert overall?
3442280	3443280	Yes, I did.
3443280	3445640	And I also picked up another video game.
3445640	3447120	I got Elite Beat Agents.
3447120	3449760	Ooh, Elite Beat Agents, one of my favorites from 2006.
3449760	3450760	What'd you think?
3450760	3451760	It's fun.
3451760	3458200	It's not as easy than Oh and Don, but I'm enjoying it.
3458200	3461400	Wait till it, the difficulty really ramps up as you go through it.
3461400	3462880	Oh, I believe it.
3462880	3465320	I'm trying to finish the last song on easy.
3465320	3466320	All right.
3466320	3470280	All right, well, Rama, thanks so much for the call, and thanks for the voicemails.
3470280	3471280	We appreciate it.
3471280	3472280	No problem.
3472280	3477320	Hey, my friend, Patty, agrees with you, what you said about the whole Wii incident, just
3477320	3478320	letting you know.
3478320	3479320	All right.
3479320	3480320	Cool.
3480320	3481320	Thanks for the support.
3481320	3482320	All right.
3482320	3483320	Later.
3483320	3484320	All right.
3484320	3485320	Bye.
3485320	3486320	All right.
3486320	3487320	Thanks so much to all of our callers tonight.
3487320	3488320	We appreciate it.
3488320	3489320	If you didn't get through, that's okay.
3489320	3490320	You can always leave us a voicemail.
3490320	3491320	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR when we're not live.
3491320	3493640	Now I'm going to open it up to any last-minute stories we have here in the studio.
3493640	3495440	Any last-minute stories from anyone?
3495440	3496720	Oh, yeah.
3496720	3497720	Loki.
3497720	3503000	Anyways, some interesting stuff for the PSP, including a brand-new game coming to it.
3503000	3506160	This should get Jamie happy, or very happy here.
3506160	3507160	Happity.
3507160	3508160	Happity.
3508160	3509160	Yes.
3509160	3510160	Very happily.
3510160	3511160	Yay.
3511160	3518520	Dracula X, Rondo of Blood is coming to the PSP, according to UK-based gaming magazine
3518520	3519520	Play.
3519520	3525360	So that's kind of cool.
3525360	3533000	Other stuff, though, if you're expecting Final Fantasy XIII this year, sorry to disappoint
3533000	3534000	you, but that's not happening.
3534000	3535000	Dream on.
3535000	3536000	We can all do that.
3536000	3543080	According to Tetsuya Nomura himself, said it's not going to happen, and says, I'm hoping
3543080	3549360	to play, or hopefully going to be out in 2008.
3549360	3555180	Yeah, and even that, they'll probably get it late 2008 in Japan, and then we won't get
3555180	3561400	it here until 2009, which sucks, because that'll be when I get a PlayStation 3, that'll be
3561400	3562400	2009.
3562400	3563400	Yeah.
3563400	3569800	According to Midway, because I know they've had their Midway's Gamer Day, was actually
3569800	3575600	last week, they had some info regarding the Midway Classics that are going to be on the
3575600	3577640	PlayStation Network.
3577640	3586520	Of course, some of the pricing for that, Demon Slayer is going to be $4.99, and it should
3586520	3593040	hit the PlayStation Store in the next few months, but it doesn't really say what are the other
3593040	3598560	costs on, say for example, the Mortal Kombat games or anything like that.
3598560	3599560	But they look good, though.
3599560	3604280	They have some screenshots actually online now of Mortal Kombat, and Rampart, and Super
3604280	3609200	Sprint, stuff like that, so that's kind of cool.
3609200	3613520	And then, I don't know what the hell this is, but apparently there's this homebrew program
3613520	3622520	called Mini VMac for the DS, where apparently they're running Mac OS on a DS, which is so
3622520	3625740	wrong, but okay.
3625740	3632100	And then, of course, a PlayStation 3 ISO loader is being worked on right now, and hopefully
3632100	3640840	it'll be done soon there in the testing phase, so piracy on the PlayStation 3 coming soon.
3640840	3642720	I'm sure Sony's thrilled to hear that news.
3642720	3643720	Oh yeah.
3643720	3645760	DarkSakura, do you have anything for us, last minute?
3645760	3648120	No, I just have my usual awesome.
3648120	3651840	All right, well then I guess that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch
3651840	3652840	Radio.
3652840	3656440	Hey guys, thanks so much for tuning in to us, downloading it, and supporting independent

3663440	3667240	I do believe there's some football game on TV, but we're not watching, so we'll be here
3667240	3672160	Sunday Night Live, 6 o'clock Pacific, to talk about more games.
3672160	3677300	So until then, this is Rob Roberts for DarkSakura and Loki saying, see you next time here on
