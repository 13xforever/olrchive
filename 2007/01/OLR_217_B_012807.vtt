00:00.000 --> 00:22.060
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:22.060 --> 00:26.860
We are here on this lovely Sunday evening, January 28, 2007 for more of Orange Lounge

00:26.860 --> 00:27.860
Radio.

00:27.860 --> 00:32.480
We're going to get into Part B. My throat is feeling a little bit better, but I'm going

00:32.480 --> 00:36.000
to step out of the room for just a second to get some coffee out of my Hello Kitty coffee

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
maker.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.920
For those who didn't listen to Part A, my throat is kind of bad tonight.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.560
So I'm going to go get some more hot stuff to drink.

00:42.560 --> 00:45.520
And can you guys take care of some gaming news for a minute?

00:45.520 --> 00:46.520
Why not?

00:46.520 --> 00:47.520
I would really appreciate that.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.520
All right.

00:48.520 --> 00:54.840
Anyways, so starting things off, this week Microsoft had announced their earnings for

00:54.840 --> 00:56.160
their quarter.

00:56.160 --> 01:01.600
And of course, the profits were down, but at least the 360 revenues were up.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.240
Well, unfortunately Microsoft went back and revised their earnings statements, basically

01:06.240 --> 01:14.780
saying that their expected 360 shipments for 2007 and spring, they reduced it down from

01:14.780 --> 01:18.120
$13 million, $15 million to $12 million.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.600
This is due to unsold inventories in stores.

01:20.600 --> 01:26.500
So basically, you know that big tower of 360s that you see in your Best Buys and your Game

01:26.500 --> 01:27.500
Stops.

01:27.500 --> 01:32.980
Well, because of that, they are dropping their shipments amount because who needs to ship

01:32.980 --> 01:36.240
more units if there's tons in the stores.

01:36.240 --> 01:40.920
Anyways, and because of that, all these stocks from other companies have dropped a little

01:40.920 --> 01:43.200
bit as well because of that news.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.000
So it's not a big surprise.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.560
I mean, the PlayStation 3 is kind of in the same boat right now where they have a ton

01:48.560 --> 01:52.120
of units in stores and no one's really buying them because there's not a lot of games out

01:52.120 --> 01:54.720
right now or it's too expensive.

01:54.720 --> 02:00.440
Either way, one of the analysts, PJ McNeely, said, video game publishers will be under

02:00.440 --> 02:06.580
pressure today after Microsoft cuts its life-to-date shipment.

02:06.580 --> 02:13.120
There is investor concern about reset of expectations around both the Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation

02:13.120 --> 02:14.120
3.

02:14.120 --> 02:19.840
So, pretty much, I guess they're playing it safe.

02:19.840 --> 02:20.840
I missed all that.

02:20.840 --> 02:21.840
Could you repeat it?

02:21.840 --> 02:22.840
No.

02:22.840 --> 02:28.920
It's basically Microsoft shipping or they're reducing their amount of shipments that they're

02:28.920 --> 02:29.920
going to be...

02:29.920 --> 02:34.380
No, I heard Microsoft's goal went down a little bit and I can see the impact that's having

02:34.380 --> 02:36.800
on things as a whole.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.200
It's only down to being a few million, I guess.

02:39.200 --> 02:43.040
That's kind of bad, but they just have to sell the units that they have right now and

02:43.040 --> 02:47.240
trust me, those units will be gone once Halo 3 comes out.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.240
Even maybe Crackdown.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.680
I mean, Crackdown might sell a few.

02:49.680 --> 02:56.440
I don't know about selling units for beta, but it couldn't hurt, I guess.

02:56.440 --> 03:00.040
This is a report coming from QJ.net speaking of the Xbox 360.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.720
This is a little bit of a hack.

03:01.720 --> 03:06.040
You can use this at your own risk, but apparently, a hack has been released, the HDD Hacker,

03:06.040 --> 03:11.360
that will allow you to use your own hard drive with the Xbox 360.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.600
Now, keep in mind there are some limitations.

03:13.600 --> 03:20.400
You can only really use a Western Digital BEVS series and only a 20 gigabyte hard drive,

03:20.400 --> 03:23.600
but keep in mind if you do it that way, a 20 gigabyte hard drive through Western Digital

03:23.600 --> 03:32.120
is going to be a hell of a lot cheaper than a regular Xbox 360 hard drive through Microsoft.

03:32.120 --> 03:36.180
The site goes on to say that once bigger Microsoft certified hard drives come out, then you'll

03:36.180 --> 03:39.640
be able to use those with the tool, but I'm thinking, no, you won't.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.360
Microsoft is very good about patching this shit as soon as they find it, and I bet you

03:42.360 --> 03:47.240
by this time next week, we'll see a patch roll out on live that will prevent this.

03:47.240 --> 03:49.640
The next patch that goes out on live will shut this thing out.

03:49.640 --> 03:50.640
No, I don't think so.

03:50.640 --> 03:51.640
Why is that?

03:51.640 --> 03:56.200
The reason why this does is actually there's information on the hard drive sector that's

03:56.200 --> 04:00.640
the same on all the hard drives because they have to be universal since they're working

04:00.640 --> 04:02.720
with all these different systems.

04:02.720 --> 04:09.480
It's basically some sort of identified device type of thing that's stored in one sector

04:09.480 --> 04:15.560
so all they do is basically mimic that on this hard drive so all it thinks is that it's

04:15.560 --> 04:21.240
a legit hard drive so there would be no way to patch this because it's a peripheral.

04:21.240 --> 04:26.720
It would be like if I took a controller for the 360 and I made it look like that's an

04:26.720 --> 04:28.600
official Microsoft controller.

04:28.600 --> 04:34.160
There's no way for it to tell between whether this is real or not.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.240
You follow the hack stuff more than I do so I'll take your word for it, but this just

04:37.240 --> 04:40.280
seems like the kind of thing that Microsoft's usually all over, but I'll take your word

04:40.280 --> 04:41.280
for it.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.080
It's not like modifying firmware or anything like that so I think that they wouldn't be

04:44.080 --> 04:47.000
able to patch this.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.920
We'll see what happens.

04:49.920 --> 05:00.200
Going into things that have not quite yet having to do with the Xbox 360, let me just

05:00.200 --> 05:02.480
rephrase this.

05:02.480 --> 05:07.720
You're all familiar with the Unreal Engine, right?

05:07.720 --> 05:08.720
Sure.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.640
There's been some good games coming out of that.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.840
Well guess who's just licensed it?

05:13.840 --> 05:16.360
It's been licensed by Squeenix.

05:16.360 --> 05:17.360
Really?

05:17.360 --> 05:18.360
Yep.

05:18.360 --> 05:32.440
There's basically a statement put out by the general manager of R&D at Square Enix that's

05:32.440 --> 05:39.560
Taku Murata, saying that it will speed up the creation process and allow developers

05:39.560 --> 05:44.200
to spend less time working on the technology.

05:44.200 --> 05:48.240
To quote, the complexity of next generation game systems featuring HD graphics and multi-core

05:48.240 --> 05:53.160
parallel processing poses a number of technological challenges to our game development, however

05:53.160 --> 05:57.360
we can expedite our game development process significantly while allowing extra time and

05:57.360 --> 06:01.480
resources to be spent on game design and mechanics.

06:01.480 --> 06:06.600
So does this mean we're going to be killing slimes in 3D, as somebody in chat said?

06:06.600 --> 06:07.600
Maybe.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.600
I like this thought.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.040
DrewNami says, Kingdom Hearts 3 using the Unreal Engine.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.360
Wouldn't that be hot?

06:12.360 --> 06:14.400
I have a boner just thinking about it.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.400
Just kidding, just kidding.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.280
But still, that's pretty exciting.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.280
The Unreal Engine's pretty good.

06:18.280 --> 06:24.320
There's actually a little bit more information regarding the Unreal Tournament itself.

06:24.320 --> 06:31.320
Unreal Tournament 2007 is now renamed as Unreal Tournament 3 and is going to be on Xbox 360.

06:31.320 --> 06:36.760
It was confirmed at Midway's Gamers' Day in Las Vegas.

06:36.760 --> 06:42.440
It's going to be developed with the PC and PS3 versions.

06:42.440 --> 06:46.920
It has release later on this year.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.480
I don't know.

06:48.480 --> 06:49.740
It's Unreal.

06:49.740 --> 06:51.280
You know one thing I do like about Unreal?

06:51.280 --> 06:54.560
I haven't played a whole lot of it, but one thing I did play it on the original Xbox because

06:54.560 --> 06:56.360
I bought it when it was like 20 bucks.

06:56.360 --> 06:57.360
It's fucking fast.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.040
It is like one of the fastest shooters I've ever played.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.440
It's amazingly fast.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.440
I like it.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.720
Even just the first Unreal Tournament was crazy.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.840
That was a game that gave me some freaking motion sickness right there.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.840
Yeah, I was going to say, you probably are not having much fun with those games with

07:10.840 --> 07:12.280
how fast they move.

07:12.280 --> 07:16.160
There's also a little bit more as far as, not necessarily just the graphics, but different

07:16.160 --> 07:18.160
multiplayer modes.

07:18.160 --> 07:24.480
There is a voice-controlled AI and player-controlled vehicles.

07:24.480 --> 07:30.160
There's also a conquest mode that will be a battle for eight teams on a map that's three

07:30.160 --> 07:36.360
times the size of the deathmatch and onslaught maps.

07:36.360 --> 07:43.200
Speaking about Square Enix here, NCSX has reported that Square Enix is going to be producing

07:43.200 --> 07:50.120
a collection of replica weapons called the Square Enix Master Arms Collection.

07:50.120 --> 07:53.840
It's basically going to be some of the weapons from the Final Fantasy series and Keyblade

07:53.840 --> 07:55.320
from Kingdom Hearts.

07:55.320 --> 08:00.480
Unfortunately, they are not going to be full-sized, so don't get your hopes up there, but they're

08:00.480 --> 08:09.080
going to range from 15 centimeters for, like, Cerberus to 26 centimeters for Sephora's

08:09.080 --> 08:10.080
Gunblade.

08:10.080 --> 08:14.240
So, right now there's four different blades to choose from.

08:14.240 --> 08:20.920
Let's see, Cerberus, which I believe, I can't remember which Final Fantasy that was from.

08:20.920 --> 08:32.040
The Keyblade, of course, from Kingdom Hearts, Squall's Gunblade, from eight, and Sephora's

08:32.040 --> 08:35.160
Gunblade from eight as well.

08:35.160 --> 08:36.160
But they look kind of cool.

08:36.160 --> 08:43.000
Of course, though, the prices aren't too expensive right now, only, well, they're $39 for each

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
one.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Awesome.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.400
I just wish they had full-sized ones, of course, then people might kill each other and who

08:50.400 --> 08:51.400
would want that?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.400
Yeah, that would hurt.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.960
This sounds like something you'd have in your house, Dark Sakura.

08:54.960 --> 08:55.960
Maybe.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.960
I have school to pay for.

08:57.960 --> 08:58.960
Alright.

08:58.960 --> 09:03.400
Well, speaking about Square Enix, you know, of course, Final Fantasy is a big game that's

09:03.400 --> 09:10.940
going to be coming out on PlayStation 3, and, you know, when PlayStation 3 came out, a lot

09:10.940 --> 09:15.580
of folks were using Final Fantasy XII, a PlayStation 2 game, on their PlayStation 3.

09:15.580 --> 09:19.560
But there were some problems, and that would be the way the game looked, because they looked

09:19.560 --> 09:20.560
uglier.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.560
Remember, we talked about this on the show a while back.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.560
Yeah.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.560
There was a YouTube video that showed, like, the side-by-side comparisons.

09:24.560 --> 09:25.760
Well, guess what?

09:25.760 --> 09:29.680
There's an upcoming firmware update that is going to include a patch that we fixed.

09:29.680 --> 09:30.680
It's already up.

09:30.680 --> 09:31.680
Oh, did it already go up?

09:31.680 --> 09:32.680
It already went up.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.680
I don't have a PlayStation 3, so I don't know.

09:33.680 --> 09:34.680
Yeah.

09:34.680 --> 09:39.800
But apparently it went up, and they did this whole little change there, is that the PlayStation

09:39.800 --> 09:44.720
1 and 2 games now will run right, and they'll look fine.

09:44.720 --> 09:48.480
And now you can also, they also did some other little things, like you can set an image photo

09:48.480 --> 09:53.080
for a user ID, and da-da-da, all this other little minor crap, Korean keyboards and stuff

09:53.080 --> 09:54.080
you can use now.

09:54.080 --> 09:59.280
You know, it's weird though, and you know on your PSP how during the months it'll change

09:59.280 --> 10:00.560
colors in the background?

10:00.560 --> 10:06.400
Well, the PS3 backgrounds will slowly fade from one color to another as time goes on

10:06.400 --> 10:07.400
through the month.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.800
It might start off black, and now it's yellow.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.440
It's kind of weird.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.600
Ew, yellow?

10:12.600 --> 10:13.600
Yeah.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.080
Not my favorite color.

10:15.080 --> 10:22.280
Well, I actually know yellow is associated with aggression, so it's not my favorite either.

10:22.280 --> 10:27.920
But there's actually though a little bit more news coming out regarding an animated Castlevania

10:27.920 --> 10:33.880
3 movie, or yeah, the Dracula's Curse movie.

10:33.880 --> 10:39.880
They're basically looking, they're still in the early stages of their production.

10:39.880 --> 10:43.040
They're working on the visual development side of everything.

10:43.040 --> 10:48.040
So it's through February, it's going to be mostly character creature design.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.800
They need background designers, background painters.

10:50.800 --> 10:56.600
They're actually looking for artists to work with that, so they actually have opened up

10:56.600 --> 10:59.640
positions in Southern California.

10:59.640 --> 11:05.400
If you actually want to submit your portfolio to them, you can actually email Belmont at

11:05.400 --> 11:07.920
Castlevania Dracula's Curse dot com.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.320
I think that's pretty cool.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.320
They're looking for artists.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.320
Give us some work.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.040
I like to see that when it comes out.

11:16.040 --> 11:22.660
Well, unfortunately, there have been some other bad vampire movies, including Blood

11:22.660 --> 11:28.120
Rain, which is up for six Razzies.

11:28.120 --> 11:34.240
It's received nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Supporting Actor, Worst

11:34.240 --> 11:39.820
Supporting Actress, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay.

11:39.820 --> 11:47.600
So that's, I guess, good news if you really hate Blood Rain.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.640
Although if you do hate Blood Rain, you would probably be disappointed to know that he's

11:50.640 --> 11:56.020
playing a sequel, and it's, I think, already in production, so that kind of sucks.

11:56.020 --> 12:01.000
One other movie that he has coming out, though, pretty soon is going to be Postal, and IGN

12:01.000 --> 12:04.280
had some news from that, actually, talking about some of the things that are going to

12:04.280 --> 12:09.760
be offending people, including such wonderful things as full frontal nudity from news radios

12:09.760 --> 12:10.760
Dave Foley.

12:10.760 --> 12:16.440
Apparently, he's going to be playing some crazy cult leader.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.320
And there's one scene...

12:18.320 --> 12:19.320
Hooray.

12:19.320 --> 12:24.120
I mean, I realize you guys know I'm gay and all, but I'm not thrilled to hear about that.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.480
I mean, he's kind of old.

12:26.480 --> 12:31.600
Anyways, Dave Foley's character in the production is called Uncle Dave, and is a twisted cult

12:31.600 --> 12:37.080
leader who uses his religious doctrine to keep his subjects in a constant state of servitude,

12:37.080 --> 12:45.000
and he exploits this by luring them into orgies at their debauchery, and says in the scenes

12:45.000 --> 12:49.680
that they saw, Foley was dressed in an open robe, and they mean open, wandering around

12:49.680 --> 12:53.400
the room, barking orders, and at the end of the scene, he takes a crap on camera.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.840
Yeah, that's the kind of movie...

12:55.840 --> 12:56.840
What?!

12:56.840 --> 12:59.760
The other fun stuff about this movie, though...

12:59.760 --> 13:04.400
Oh my God, talk about your career going downhill after, you know, news radio going off the

13:04.400 --> 13:08.000
field, that's got to be made up.

13:08.000 --> 13:15.240
Other stuff that they have in the movie, it says there's stuff about 9-11, they actually

13:15.240 --> 13:20.680
make fun of 9-11, they make fun of school shootings, including, I guess there was one

13:20.680 --> 13:27.020
scene that says an ultra-violent shocking image of an overhead shot of bloody children

13:27.020 --> 13:33.680
laying in a schoolyard, and apparently, Bin Laden's one of the main characters in this,

13:33.680 --> 13:34.680
so...

13:34.680 --> 13:41.440
This sounds like the dumbest fucking thing in the world, I mean seriously, I mean there's

13:41.440 --> 13:46.220
a difference between, like, you know, parody that's somewhat amusing, and this just sounds

13:46.220 --> 13:50.000
like stupid after stupid after stupid.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.560
Yeah, so, it should be interesting, I guess.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.040
Okay, interesting's a good word to define, I suppose.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.040
I'll see it, though.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.400
I will definitely go see it.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.400
Oh, God.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.400
Have fun.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.400
By yourself.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.360
Unless you can talk Nellie into going.

14:05.360 --> 14:10.800
All right, well, one thing we didn't go over in part A were the release dates, even though

14:10.800 --> 14:14.240
Loki gave us some exclusives, we didn't talk about what's coming out this week, so I want

14:14.240 --> 14:17.280
to start it off talking about Japanese release dates, of which, honestly, folks, there's

14:17.280 --> 14:18.880
not a whole lot.

14:18.880 --> 14:23.180
January was a dry month for us over here in the US, and February, at least the beginning

14:23.180 --> 14:26.000
part of it, looks to be a bit slow over there in Japan.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.640
We do have J-League Pro Soccer Club Otsukoru 5 coming out on February 1st.

14:32.640 --> 14:40.320
So zero shikikan josentai ni, which is best hits from Taito, and I'm not sure if that's

14:40.320 --> 14:46.780
a game that's actually out over here, looks like some type of old school B-52 type bomber

14:46.780 --> 14:47.780
game.

14:47.780 --> 14:51.320
I don't think this is a game they have over here.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.440
Twin Cobra?

14:52.440 --> 14:55.600
I don't think so.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
I don't remember.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.600
What's the word at the time?

14:58.600 --> 15:02.720
Shikikan josentai ni.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.880
Ah, whatever.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.120
It's just the best hits anyway.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.120
It's already out.

15:07.120 --> 15:11.360
It's just going in to be a little bit cheaper, and let's see, what do we have over on the

15:11.360 --> 15:12.400
Nintendo DS?

15:12.400 --> 15:14.040
We do have a couple things coming out on the DS.

15:14.040 --> 15:17.440
We have Monster House, which I suppose is a release a lot of folks are looking forward

15:17.440 --> 15:25.420
to, as well as Bokujo Monogatari Kimi to Sodatsu Shima coming out for Marvelous Entertainment

15:25.420 --> 15:26.920
as well over there in Japan.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.360
And that's really about all there is to note.

15:29.360 --> 15:33.720
Oh, I'm sorry, there actually is an Ys game coming out on the Sony PSP.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.520
I guess that's certainly notable.

15:35.520 --> 15:36.980
I love Ys.

15:36.980 --> 15:42.320
The game is called Nappishitom no Hako, and it has a special edition coming out on February

15:42.320 --> 15:43.320
1st.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.320
Ooh.

15:44.320 --> 15:50.600
Well, for our UK release dates, in February we have coming out on the first Warpath for

15:50.600 --> 15:51.600
PC.

15:51.600 --> 15:57.720
On the second, we have Arthur and the Invisibles for PS2, DS, PC, Game Boy Advance, Contact

15:57.720 --> 16:08.080
on DS, also Dungeon Siege Throne of Agony on PSP, Europa Universalis III on PC, Ghost

16:08.080 --> 16:15.200
Rider on Xbox, NFL Street 3 going to be on PSP and PlayStation 2, Sega Genesis Collection

16:15.200 --> 16:22.440
on PS2, PSP, and on the fifth, Galactic Civilizations 2, but that's coming out later.

16:22.440 --> 16:27.440
Anyways, for the US, there's a couple of few good things coming out this week.

16:27.440 --> 16:32.000
The big one, of course, being Rogue Galaxy on PlayStation 2.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.160
Brand new RPG by Level 5, you may remember Dragon Quest VIII.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.160
Awesome game.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.760
Reviewed pretty good from what I've seen.

16:39.760 --> 16:45.800
Civil Stations Midway is coming on PC and Xbox 360, a pretty good World War II kind

16:45.800 --> 16:49.400
of aerial and naval combat game.

16:49.400 --> 16:56.440
On the PC, Vanguard Saga of Heroes, and let's see here, Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation

16:56.440 --> 17:09.740
3, Fusion Frenzy 2 on Xbox 360, City Life World Edition on the PC, and Monopoly Here

17:09.740 --> 17:13.880
and Now on the PC.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.760
That's about it for this week, at least.

17:15.760 --> 17:20.080
All right, well, I wanted to mention this, and this is a little bit embarrassing because

17:20.080 --> 17:21.080
the...

17:21.080 --> 17:22.080
Oh, no, there it is.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.080
Good, we got it.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.080
The link wasn't working previously.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.680
For some reason, I was trying to hit Blizzard Entertainment to look at this press release

17:26.680 --> 17:30.160
that talks about World of Warcraft, The Burning Crusade.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.760
Of course, you know that that game just came out earlier this month.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.960
Well, get this.

17:33.960 --> 17:40.000
It sold 2.4 million copies in the first 24 hours.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.600
It was released simultaneously in North America, Europe, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia,

17:44.600 --> 17:50.080
and then January 17th, Australia and New Zealand just the day after, which actually would,

17:50.080 --> 17:52.360
because they're on the other side of the day line, but never mind.

17:52.360 --> 17:57.280
Regardless, it came out, it sold 2.4 million copies in 24 hours.

17:57.280 --> 18:02.420
That's pretty impressive and certainly shattered any existing PC game records that were already

18:02.420 --> 18:03.420
out there.

18:03.420 --> 18:07.400
So, lots of World of Warcraft addicts out there in the world, apparently.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.400
People that were buying two or three for their families.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.400
Are they ignoring their babies?

18:09.400 --> 18:10.400
I don't know.

18:10.400 --> 18:14.960
For those that only listen to us during the podcast, we have a bonus segment we do here

18:14.960 --> 18:19.240
live that only live listeners, whether it be on All Games or Orange Wells Radio can

18:19.240 --> 18:20.240
listen to.

18:20.240 --> 18:22.800
Tonight, we spent like 30 minutes talking about World of Warcraft addiction, thanks

18:22.800 --> 18:26.120
to a Tyra Banks show clip.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.200
So that's what Jamie's making reference to.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.200
Interesting.

18:29.200 --> 18:34.560
Let me read a quick quote here from the co-founder of Blizzard Entertainment, Mike Morhaime.

18:34.560 --> 18:38.720
The Burning Crusade has already exceeded even our most ambitious expectations.

18:38.720 --> 18:42.280
We're pleased that so many players are eager to see all of the new content that the expansion

18:42.280 --> 18:46.040
has to offer, and we look forward to seeing everyone online as additional players continue

18:46.040 --> 18:48.720
to upgrade in the days ahead.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.240
I still have not bought the expansion.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.040
I won't be buying it until I hit level 40.

18:52.040 --> 18:55.320
That's what I promised myself.

18:55.320 --> 19:02.720
Well, there are, I think, other MMOs that might be pulling people's addiction.

19:02.720 --> 19:06.000
There's a Lord of the Rings MMO actually has a date.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.760
It will be launching, it's a Lord of the Rings Shadow of Angmar to be released in Europe

19:11.760 --> 19:17.080
on the 24th of April, according to Codemasters.

19:17.080 --> 19:24.100
The price of it actually is going to be a special pre-order rate for $99.99 that has

19:24.100 --> 19:28.160
a lifetime membership instead of a subscription fee.

19:28.160 --> 19:38.800
So you can either do that or pay £5.99 a month for a six month package.

19:38.800 --> 19:45.520
But the advantage of pre-ordering it gives you early access to the game for ten days.

19:45.520 --> 19:50.560
You can use a pre-launch character in the full game, so basically whatever you make

19:50.560 --> 19:53.240
during this little beta is yours to hold onto.

19:53.240 --> 19:58.120
You get a unique in-game bonus item, six Lord of the Rings online stickers, and a special

19:58.120 --> 20:03.120
window sticker.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.880
It seems kind of interesting.

20:06.880 --> 20:10.600
I don't know, there's so many MMOs out there really.

20:10.600 --> 20:15.600
Well, I'm reading some comments from chat on the previous MMO story we talked about.

20:15.600 --> 20:19.200
Joshi16 says, Blizzard rep translation.

20:19.200 --> 20:23.800
Money money money money, which is kind of true.

20:23.800 --> 20:27.520
DrewNami our resident World of Warcraft addict says, I'm a rogue, I do it from behind.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.440
Is that like on a t-shirt or something?

20:29.440 --> 20:31.440
Yeah, that's disgusting.

20:31.440 --> 20:35.720
And Brad from PodCulture says, I'm waiting for the Firefly MMO.

20:35.720 --> 20:36.720
Amen!

20:36.720 --> 20:45.760
Also, though, just to let you know, I'm on the US site for this Lord of the Rings game.

20:45.760 --> 21:00.800
For the pre-order special that they're having on that one, when you pre-order it, you have

21:00.800 --> 21:04.960
$199 for the lifetime thing, or $9.99 monthly.

21:04.960 --> 21:08.440
Early access, you keep your launch care, it's the same thing really.

21:08.440 --> 21:12.760
You get an enchanted cloak of regeneration and a ring of agility.

21:12.760 --> 21:20.000
I had to read some of these other interesting comments.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
SSJ100Matt says, dear Blizzard, since you have all this money, you wouldn't mind putting

21:24.000 --> 21:26.760
Starcraft on DS, would you?

21:26.760 --> 21:31.360
And Michael Doi is going to make a fan with Jamie here saying, I want a Doctor Who MMO.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.880
Hell yeah!

21:32.880 --> 21:33.880
I saw that coming.

21:33.880 --> 21:38.280
I might send it for the beta for this, though.

21:38.280 --> 21:43.320
Anyways, so before Doctor Who MMO, you're going to see something else coming from BBC.

21:43.320 --> 21:47.560
That would be CBBC, their kid's property.

21:47.560 --> 21:51.880
They're going to be creating an MMO based on that called CBBC World.

21:51.880 --> 21:58.720
It's going to be aimed at kids ages 7 to 12, and it's going to kind of just be your online

21:58.720 --> 22:05.840
MMO for kids, just like Toontown Disney thing over here.

22:05.840 --> 22:14.360
It's going to have a bunch of custom avatars, minigames, music videos, completely lame for

22:14.360 --> 22:18.080
anybody over the age of 12, but Jamie will still be signed up to play.

22:18.080 --> 22:23.760
No, it's going to be like Gaia Online or something, which I quit in a day because it was boring.

22:23.760 --> 22:27.500
You'll still play it because if it's BBC related, it might remotely have a Doctor Who

22:27.500 --> 22:29.040
reference in it, and you'll be like...

22:29.040 --> 22:32.280
If someone tells me for sure there's a Doctor Who reference, I'll sign up.

22:32.280 --> 22:36.160
It'll be funny.

22:36.160 --> 22:39.480
I only want our UK listeners to tell me.

22:39.480 --> 22:40.480
Alright, fine.

22:40.480 --> 22:43.560
I was going to say, in a completely unrelated note that doesn't even have to do with video

22:43.560 --> 22:48.320
games, but I think it's kind of funny regarding the BBC, I read on some reality TV news site.

22:48.320 --> 22:53.520
Don't ask me what I was doing reading it, but I was, that the BBC is doing a Harry Potter

22:53.520 --> 22:54.520
reality show.

22:54.520 --> 22:59.320
It's not called Harry Potter, but they're sending kids to Magic School, and it's going

22:59.320 --> 23:02.840
to be like a reality show for kids in Magic School, and they actually have to do magic

23:02.840 --> 23:03.840
tricks.

23:03.840 --> 23:04.840
Do you mean Devil School?

23:04.840 --> 23:05.840
No, it's Magic School.

23:05.840 --> 23:06.840
You mean Devil School?

23:06.840 --> 23:07.840
Yeah, I get it.

23:07.840 --> 23:08.840
I get it.

23:08.840 --> 23:09.840
I see what you did there.

23:09.840 --> 23:10.840
But no, it sounds really cheesy.

23:10.840 --> 23:14.800
But I hope they bring the show over to America, because it would be a hoot.

23:14.800 --> 23:15.800
Magic School.

23:15.800 --> 23:19.680
Because they get a lot of shows from Britain over here, and it should be hosted by David

23:19.680 --> 23:21.800
Copperfield, because he's washed up anyway.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.440
What the hell ever happened to David Copperfield?

23:23.440 --> 23:24.440
He just disappeared.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.840
He just made himself disappear.

23:26.840 --> 23:31.440
Well, one game that disappeared but made a hell of a comeback, moving into some non-MMO

23:31.440 --> 23:34.200
PC gaming news, Sam and Max.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.520
They were gone for a long, long time, and then they came back.

23:36.520 --> 23:40.480
They're getting new life thanks to GameTap and some of the other distribution methods

23:40.480 --> 23:41.760
they're doing.

23:41.760 --> 23:46.320
Episode one, Culture Shock for Sam and Max, came out in October of 2006.

23:46.320 --> 23:51.960
Episode two came out December of 2006, and now episode three just came out on GameTap

23:51.960 --> 23:52.960
just this past week.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.480
It's titled The Mole, The Mob, and The Meatball.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.840
It's going to be the third part of a six-part series.

23:58.840 --> 24:01.080
From what I understand, I have yet to play these games myself.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.080
I really need to.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.080
I have a GameTap subscription.

24:03.080 --> 24:04.720
I need to put down the wow and get into these games.

24:04.720 --> 24:08.560
From what I understand, none of these episodes are really long.

24:08.560 --> 24:13.760
Maybe you'll play them for four hours, depending on how much you play.

24:13.760 --> 24:18.400
If you have to explore, if you look at Cranny or not.

24:18.400 --> 24:21.160
It sounds kind of interesting.

24:21.160 --> 24:26.480
You often hear about these episodic gaming, but they kind of produce one or two episodes

24:26.480 --> 24:27.480
and then that's it.

24:27.480 --> 24:31.200
It's kind of nice to see Sam and Max keep going at it and being very successful.

24:31.200 --> 24:35.520
I've heard nothing but raves about the game, so I promise you I will play Sam and Max at

24:35.520 --> 24:39.280
least part one, maybe all the way through part three, depending on how I enjoy it, before

24:39.280 --> 24:42.400
the month's over, which doesn't give me much time.

24:42.400 --> 24:46.660
Hopefully the series will run a little longer than the cartoon series that they had.

24:46.660 --> 24:50.280
You can see the cartoon series on GameTap, for whatever it's worth.

24:50.280 --> 24:56.960
Well, for our PC gamers, there's a bit of sad news.

24:56.960 --> 25:00.400
Age of Conan has been delayed even longer.

25:00.400 --> 25:05.680
It will be out in October, it actually will ship October 30th.

25:05.680 --> 25:13.960
Xbox 360 version is going to be in 2008, so it'll be after that.

25:13.960 --> 25:16.360
It looks interesting.

25:16.360 --> 25:19.400
It looks pretty, I guess.

25:19.400 --> 25:23.840
But you know, I think that our PC fans that have been looking forward to this, I feel

25:23.840 --> 25:26.560
sorry that you have to wait any longer, but...

25:26.560 --> 25:29.320
Just it doesn't look like your cup of tea, particularly.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.320
No.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.040
Bring on the BBC chibi game.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.920
Hell no!

25:34.920 --> 25:35.920
I...

25:35.920 --> 25:38.440
I'm just messing with you.

25:38.440 --> 25:39.440
What?

25:39.440 --> 25:40.440
Playing Guild Wars.

25:40.440 --> 25:41.440
Heart.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.160
Guild Wars is pretty... are you actually playing Guild Wars?

25:43.160 --> 25:44.400
I'll go back to Guild Wars and play one more.

25:44.400 --> 25:45.560
If that thing hasn't expired, then yeah.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.020
You should come play WoW with us.

25:47.020 --> 25:48.020
Come play WoW.

25:48.020 --> 25:49.020
Pay for my account, okay?

25:49.020 --> 25:50.020
No.

25:50.020 --> 25:51.020
I don't have money.

25:51.020 --> 25:53.800
Maybe for your birthday I'll get you a card, so you can come play WoW with us.

25:53.800 --> 25:54.800
Okay.

25:54.800 --> 25:55.800
I'll get you a Blizzard card.

25:55.800 --> 25:56.800
You know what they need to do?

25:56.800 --> 25:57.800
What?

25:57.800 --> 26:02.400
They need to have porn tycoon, because that would be the greatest game to like, you know,

26:02.400 --> 26:04.280
run your porn, you know...

26:04.280 --> 26:07.640
What the fuck did that have to do with anything we were just talking about?

26:07.640 --> 26:12.080
I saw an ad for a tycoon game and I was thinking PC stuff.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.280
I think that'd be awesome.

26:14.280 --> 26:17.160
There could be some major money made there.

26:17.160 --> 26:22.040
And then just come out on the DS.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.760
Any more curveballs you want to throw at us?

26:23.760 --> 26:30.200
Well if, you know, you're not into porn tycoon or, you know, Age of Conan, you might be interested

26:30.200 --> 26:33.220
in Ghost Recon Advance of Warfighter 2 for the PC.

26:33.220 --> 26:38.960
It's going to be coming out day and date with the Xbox 360 version, which is March 9th.

26:38.960 --> 26:45.360
It's going to feature some more multiplayer stuff as well as up to 32 players online,

26:45.360 --> 26:49.880
and more game modes, including the, you know, standard deathmatch co-op and stuff.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.720
Plus it's just going to have a whole new storyline.

26:52.720 --> 26:57.240
Be honest, the game looked originally kind of like the first one a lot, but, you know,

26:57.240 --> 26:58.840
the storyline sounds pretty interesting.

26:58.840 --> 27:03.760
Almost like they're going to do, I want to say there's like, Mexicans invading Texas

27:03.760 --> 27:09.400
or something, and some sort of, like, they have to stave off some civil war over Mexico

27:09.400 --> 27:10.400
and stuff.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.360
I don't know, it was a fun game the first time around.

27:12.360 --> 27:15.560
I cheated the whole way through it, by the way.

27:15.560 --> 27:16.560
Surprise.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.560
It was fun, though.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.600
Infinite grenade launchers are awesome.

27:19.600 --> 27:24.440
See, I knew you and your random porn tycoon outburst would stir chat.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.360
Oh, going on in our chat room.

27:26.360 --> 27:30.880
The Rob D. says, Loki just had his, what if it snowed in San Francisco moment?

27:30.880 --> 27:34.880
Mechlar says, porn tycoon, first off, build a fluffer room.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.800
Because the fluffers aren't an important part of pornography.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.560
And then Dark Tetsuya says, I thought they made that.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.480
It was called Playboy Mansion.

27:42.480 --> 27:45.160
No, Playboy Mansion was lame.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.960
How would you improve on Playboy Mansion for porn tycoon?

27:47.960 --> 27:53.020
Um, actually make it cool and not Playboy, because Playboy, to be honest, just sucks.

27:53.020 --> 27:57.000
They just want to be x-rated, but they're too classy for that shit, so, you know, if

27:57.000 --> 28:00.880
it was like, you know, Penthouse Mansion or something like that, I'd be a little, you

28:00.880 --> 28:02.400
know, step in the right direction there.

28:02.400 --> 28:07.520
Joshi16 says, Neverland Ranch tycoon, one person buys it, guess who?

28:07.520 --> 28:11.040
Peter Pan?

28:11.040 --> 28:17.480
All right, well, you know, I think the tycoon series is one of those series that has just

28:17.480 --> 28:23.920
been done over and over and over to death, but GamesRadar.com would disagree because

28:23.920 --> 28:29.840
they posted their list of the top seven series run into the ground this week.

28:29.840 --> 28:34.640
And this, of course, would be games that, you know, they were popular and then things

28:34.640 --> 28:38.320
just start to kind of go wrong with the series.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.360
So have you guys seen this list already?

28:40.360 --> 28:42.200
Loki, Jamie, have you guys seen the list already?

28:42.200 --> 28:43.200
Yeah.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.680
Okay, Loki, Jamie, have you read this list already?

28:44.680 --> 28:48.120
Okay, what would you think would be on this list, besides Tomb Raider, which is up on

28:48.120 --> 28:49.280
the screen right now?

28:49.280 --> 28:53.400
What games do you think, number seven is Tomb Raider, what series do you think have just

28:53.400 --> 28:55.840
been run into the ground?

28:55.840 --> 28:57.320
Remakes of Final Fantasy VII.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.320
Okay, well, let's see if it shows up.

28:59.320 --> 29:02.680
All right, number seven is Tomb Raider.

29:02.680 --> 29:07.320
Number six is Mega Man, because, I mean, really, I mean, there's been all those stinking battle

29:07.320 --> 29:11.320
network games, but there was, you know, there was never really a Mega Man 9.

29:11.320 --> 29:15.760
Mega Man X games kind of ended in 2004, and so, you know, Mega Man's just kind of been

29:15.760 --> 29:16.880
done to death.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.480
They need a resurgence of Mega Man, I think.

29:19.480 --> 29:22.040
Viewtiful Joe is at number five, which I think is an interesting selection.

29:22.040 --> 29:24.240
They had like two or three games for that series.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.240
That's hardly run into the ground.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.060
But were any of them as good as the first one?

29:27.060 --> 29:30.560
But they, you know, to be honest, though, they may not have been as good as the first

29:30.560 --> 29:35.280
one, but it's like, it's, you have to kind of take off to run it into the ground, you

29:35.280 --> 29:36.280
know what I mean?

29:36.280 --> 29:40.520
GamesRadar cites Red Hot Rumble, which was a Smash Brothers type fighter game that had

29:40.520 --> 29:43.360
Viewtiful Joe characters in it.

29:43.360 --> 29:45.440
Number four was Dynasty Warriors.

29:45.440 --> 29:49.560
That game, every single Dynasty Warriors game is exactly the same as the one before it.

29:49.560 --> 29:54.040
And then they keep doing this fucking Empire shit, which is exactly the same game all over

29:54.040 --> 29:55.040
again.

29:55.040 --> 29:59.880
Number three is Tenchu, and they cite the PSP version, as this has just been done too

29:59.880 --> 30:00.880
much now.

30:00.880 --> 30:01.880
Who cares?

30:01.880 --> 30:04.760
I mean, that game, I don't, there's still not that many games.

30:04.760 --> 30:05.760
Number two is Spy Hunter.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.760
I agree with this.

30:06.760 --> 30:09.560
Okay, there's been like three games in that series, or four.

30:09.560 --> 30:12.520
But seriously, it was, it was gone for the longest time.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.960
You had Spy Hunter and then a forgettable sequel in the arcades, and then it was gone

30:15.960 --> 30:19.180
forever, and then suddenly Midway decided to make this resurgence out of it, and it's

30:19.180 --> 30:21.080
not been anything to scream about.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.080
Right?

30:22.080 --> 30:23.080
Okay.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.760
Alright, well that's why they say they run it into the ground.

30:25.760 --> 30:33.360
They cite Spy Hunter 2 and Spy Hunter Nowhere to Run, three games by three different developers.

30:33.360 --> 30:38.480
The number one series they say has been run into the ground, Sonic the Hedgehog, the number

30:38.480 --> 30:39.480
one series.

30:39.480 --> 30:46.920
And of course they cite the GBA port of the original that was god-awful, in 2006 Rivals

30:46.920 --> 30:49.000
and Riders, which weren't that great.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.240
Of course this new one that's god-awful, they say the last truly good Sonic game according

30:53.240 --> 30:58.480
to GamesRadar, Sonic Rush back in 2005 was the last good one.

30:58.480 --> 31:01.080
You know what I think is interesting though?

31:01.080 --> 31:04.480
I know a lot of folks out there think we're Nintendo fanboys and girls here on this program,

31:04.480 --> 31:09.400
and to some extent, you know, we are a little bit, but hasn't Mario had some pretty shitty

31:09.400 --> 31:10.400
games too?

31:10.400 --> 31:11.400
Yeah.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.440
Did you ever play Mario is Missing?

31:13.440 --> 31:14.680
That was a PC game though.

31:14.680 --> 31:17.560
No, it was, there was a version on Super Nintendo that was pretty awful.

31:17.560 --> 31:20.200
Luigi's Mansion, not that great.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.160
A lot of people didn't like Mario Sunshine.

31:22.160 --> 31:27.680
I thought it was pretty good myself, but a lot of folks didn't like it for whatever reason.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.720
Why is Mario getting a buy out of all this?

31:29.720 --> 31:34.880
I mean, I guess, I don't know, maybe because Mario 64 was pretty rad and some of the new

31:34.880 --> 31:37.920
Super Mario Brothers, but I don't know, it kind of seems like some people get a buy out

31:37.920 --> 31:39.360
of this.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.440
There's been some pretty shitty Mario games.

31:41.440 --> 31:42.440
Yeah.

31:42.440 --> 31:43.440
So I don't know.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.080
Mario is Missing.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.080
What about Donkey Kong?

31:47.080 --> 31:50.800
Oh, that Mario vs. Donkey Kong, well those games are okay.

31:50.800 --> 31:52.360
No, I meant just Donkey Kong stuff.

31:52.360 --> 31:53.360
I mean, the Donkey Kong Country series.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.360
Donkey Kong Country got rammed into the ground.

31:55.360 --> 31:59.480
It was okay, but then they had a stupid fucking Bongo shit, and then, I don't know.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.800
I don't know, the Bongo games were interesting.

32:00.800 --> 32:06.240
Yeah, but then they had those other ones where you had to use the Bongos to move up a, what

32:06.240 --> 32:10.120
was that one where you had to basically just use the L and R buttons on it?

32:10.120 --> 32:11.120
I don't know.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.200
I think a lot of the franchises out there kind of suck.

32:14.200 --> 32:17.320
Ooh, Rama made a good one that these guys left off the list.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.620
Don't forget Spyro.

32:19.620 --> 32:22.400
That's a great one that should have been on the list.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.400
Good catch, Rama.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.040
Or Crash Bandicoot.

32:25.040 --> 32:28.080
Those are both really good ones.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.120
Let's see, what else do we have?

32:29.120 --> 32:32.800
The Rob D says, yeah, but the last real Mario game came out 11 years ago.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.520
That would depend on what you consider a real Mario game.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.520
How about Rampage?

32:35.520 --> 32:37.520
Oh, that's a good one, too.

32:37.520 --> 32:41.080
See, we should come up with our own list, and of course, Jeremy Todd once says Metal

32:41.080 --> 32:42.080
Slug.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.080
Actually.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.080
What about Contra?

32:44.080 --> 32:49.000
It's been a while since we had a Contra game, hasn't it?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
No, last year.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Well, besides the arcade.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Really?

32:52.000 --> 32:55.320
Well, I meant like 2005.

32:55.320 --> 32:56.320
We had Shattered...

32:56.320 --> 32:58.320
Wait, not Shattered Soldier.

32:58.320 --> 33:01.360
Damn, I don't remember the last one.

33:01.360 --> 33:04.560
Vidpowah says, I admit I had a blast with the Mario is Missing games.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.000
Well, I'm glad someone enjoyed it.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Ninja Turtle games.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Oh, good one.

33:08.000 --> 33:13.960
See, we got some really good ones here, but the list wasn't so bad as it was.

33:13.960 --> 33:17.720
All right, well, another thing that's not so bad is reading your emails that we get

33:17.720 --> 33:18.720
every week.

33:18.720 --> 33:22.080
We rather enjoy it, and DarkSakura is queen of the mailbag, and when you send your emails

33:22.080 --> 33:26.600
to mailbag at orangelaungerator.com, DarkSakura will read and often respond to your emails

33:26.600 --> 33:31.120
and pick some of her favorites to read here on the program, again, because we do get quite

33:31.120 --> 33:32.120
a few letters.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.080
We can't read them all, but we can try.

33:34.080 --> 33:38.480
So DarkSakura is going to open up the mailbag and dive on in and see what we've got to read

33:38.480 --> 33:39.480
this week.

33:39.480 --> 33:43.200
DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag this week?

33:43.200 --> 33:48.240
Two emails.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.240
That's it?

33:49.240 --> 33:50.240
Yeah.

33:50.240 --> 33:51.240
All right.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.240
Well, let's do it.

33:52.240 --> 33:53.240
Okay.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.240
First one.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.240
Salutations, O.L.R.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.240
Cast.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.600
I just had a question about the Nintendo Wii and if its games contain region coding.

33:58.600 --> 33:59.600
Thanks for reading this.

33:59.600 --> 34:03.440
Also, I don't know if you guys heard about this article, but someone tried to electrocute

34:03.440 --> 34:05.340
themselves with an arcade machine.

34:05.340 --> 34:09.240
Their Pac-Man high score was beaten, and he claimed that he had nothing left to live for,

34:09.240 --> 34:12.120
so he attempted suicide with a Pac-Man machine.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.120
Pretty weird, though.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.520
Comes from Blue Zenith.

34:16.520 --> 34:19.240
He should have just tipped the machine over on himself.

34:19.240 --> 34:20.240
That wouldn't kill anybody.

34:20.240 --> 34:24.640
I've had an arcade machine fall on me.

34:24.640 --> 34:25.640
First of all...

34:25.640 --> 34:28.440
Did it hit you in the head?

34:28.440 --> 34:30.800
Because that might explain some stuff.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.040
Teasing just heart.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.440
I'm letting you buy me dinner.

34:34.440 --> 34:39.960
You can make it up to me with potato pancakes.

34:39.960 --> 34:42.340
My car is dead.

34:42.340 --> 34:43.340
As for the Wii...

34:43.340 --> 34:44.760
Would you like a nice cup?

34:44.760 --> 34:46.760
Would you like me to bring you a cup of wham?

34:46.760 --> 34:51.960
Rob, I'm trying to do emails, so you can shut up, okay?

34:51.960 --> 34:52.960
All.

34:52.960 --> 34:53.960
Own.

34:53.960 --> 34:54.960
Okay.

34:54.960 --> 34:55.960
Jamie.

34:55.960 --> 34:56.960
Jamie.

34:56.960 --> 34:57.960
Jamie.

34:57.960 --> 34:58.960
Jamie.

34:58.960 --> 35:04.920
So at any rate, the Nintendo Wii is definitely region coded, so yeah.

35:04.920 --> 35:05.920
But they're working on it.

35:05.920 --> 35:06.920
They're working on it.

35:06.920 --> 35:14.080
And also about someone killing themselves over a score.

35:14.080 --> 35:15.920
Darwin loves them.

35:15.920 --> 35:20.440
Sorry, that type of person should be removed from the dream pool.

35:20.440 --> 35:23.040
Moving forward to the next and last email.

35:23.040 --> 35:29.600
A pretty long one coming to us from someone who has not signed the email, so I'm just

35:29.600 --> 35:31.600
going to say JCK.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.800
Hey guys, great show.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.920
Just wanted to give some feedback.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.180
Two news items on last week's show.

35:39.180 --> 35:45.680
The Dallas Area TV Network's WFAA's report on the PS3 and Wii as a gateway to porn, and

35:45.680 --> 35:46.680
the New York State Bill...

35:46.680 --> 35:47.680
Really?

35:47.680 --> 35:48.680
They're giving away porn on the PS3?

35:48.680 --> 35:49.680
Now I'll buy one.

35:49.680 --> 35:50.680
Hey Rob, shut up.

35:50.680 --> 35:57.860
And the New York State Bill A00547, and later the A02024, prohibiting the sale of certain

35:57.860 --> 35:58.860
games to minors.

35:58.860 --> 36:01.560
Do you want to read the email, though, if you really want to talk?

36:01.560 --> 36:02.560
No, no, I'm fine.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.080
I'm going to go get more coffee for my Hello Kitty maker.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.080
Okay.

36:06.080 --> 36:09.600
There are two kinds of parents, those who accept that the world is hostile and their

36:09.600 --> 36:15.280
children must be proactively educated or sheltered, and those who want the world to be safe so

36:15.280 --> 36:19.960
that their children will be sheltered naturally with a minimum of parental involvement.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.220
Most parents are lazy and fall into the second category.

36:23.220 --> 36:27.120
There are ones who are technophobic and will not take the time to investigate parental

36:27.120 --> 36:29.160
controls on hardware and software.

36:29.160 --> 36:35.240
They are the ones who seek to censor and control every content distribution chain.

36:35.240 --> 36:38.480
The problem is that the world cannot be made safe, even if we could agree on what safe

36:38.480 --> 36:40.840
is without oppressing sub-subculture somewhere.

36:40.840 --> 36:44.360
It is impossible for any of us to remake the world in our own image.

36:44.360 --> 36:49.440
We have to accept that things that we don't like exist, that our children will stumble

36:49.440 --> 36:54.400
onto them if we don't shelter them or otherwise prepare them for that initial contact.

36:54.400 --> 36:58.480
I may not agree with the religious conservatives who homeschool their kids and filter their

36:58.480 --> 37:01.420
TV, but at least they're active parents.

37:01.420 --> 37:04.400
There are legal issues that surround the New York Bills.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.400
First of all, who decides what is objectionable?

37:06.400 --> 37:09.960
The ESRB and MPAA are private industry bodies.

37:09.960 --> 37:14.560
We cannot pass a law that deputizes these private bodies to rate things, which is why

37:14.560 --> 37:18.840
a law that limits the sale of M or AO games is unenforceable.

37:18.840 --> 37:22.800
If the government seeks to control, it must create a government body to identify what

37:22.800 --> 37:24.060
to control.

37:24.060 --> 37:28.000
Every ratings scheme in the U.S. is voluntary, the music industry chooses to use parental

37:28.000 --> 37:35.200
advisory, the music industry chooses to get MPAA ratings, and the gaming industry chooses

37:35.200 --> 37:37.060
to submit to the ESRB.

37:37.060 --> 37:42.160
The public pressure is on retail distribution chains to comply with what forces the content

37:42.160 --> 37:47.360
creators to adhere, which is why every major game retailer already checks ID.

37:47.360 --> 37:50.960
The system works and there is no reason to change it.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.240
And that's the end of the email.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.240
Yes?

37:54.240 --> 37:57.840
I got nothing.

37:57.840 --> 38:15.640
I have a whole problem with the government being way too involved in our personal lives.

38:15.640 --> 38:28.080
I think that it is unreasonable to expect somebody else to do to protect their children

38:28.080 --> 38:32.960
from influences there are really no way to control.

38:32.960 --> 38:37.240
It is your job, I'm sorry, it is a person's job as a parent to prepare their child for

38:37.240 --> 38:38.360
the real world.

38:38.360 --> 38:43.680
I've seen what's become of people who are too sheltered, they usually end up with severe

38:43.680 --> 38:49.880
social problems.

38:49.880 --> 38:58.480
The reference to the homeschool religious fundamentalist, a friend of mine that I met

38:58.480 --> 39:06.680
here when I moved out to California, she had been so sheltered, she actually didn't go

39:06.680 --> 39:17.660
to school until she was in high school and thought that oral sex was talking about sex.

39:17.660 --> 39:23.200
I knew someone who thought the F word was fart.

39:23.200 --> 39:28.420
And so when confronted with the reality of their ignorance, you know, who's to blame

39:28.420 --> 39:32.640
but their parents, you know, keeping them from the stuff that's going on in the real

39:32.640 --> 39:33.640
world.

39:33.640 --> 39:41.160
To go back to the statement regarding needing a governmental body to participate with a

39:41.160 --> 39:49.080
government controlled law, I guess it's the government controlled, that's not redundant.

39:49.080 --> 39:56.480
I understand the logic in that but I still think that if we have a private party that

39:56.480 --> 40:04.640
is not involved in the government, we are likely to get less, I would say, bias.

40:04.640 --> 40:09.120
I'm sorry, our government is bought and paid for, you know.

40:09.120 --> 40:16.480
For every person that you elect into government positions, there's a lobbyist behind them

40:16.480 --> 40:22.600
paying lots of money for them to say, you know, I think that cigarettes are okay.

40:22.600 --> 40:26.680
Is that why Travis is running for president?

40:26.680 --> 40:27.680
I don't know.

40:27.680 --> 40:28.680
I don't know either.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.440
I was just putting that out there.

40:30.440 --> 40:35.460
So I actually think that it is better for us to have that separation with those facilities

40:35.460 --> 40:36.920
and the government.

40:36.920 --> 40:41.440
I think the law is unnecessary and I agree, unenforceable the way it is in its current

40:41.440 --> 40:42.440
incarnation.

40:42.440 --> 40:47.320
All right, well I read through the email while you were ranting there and it was well thought

40:47.320 --> 40:48.320
out.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.680
I like getting those thoughtful emails.

40:49.680 --> 40:52.480
I love when people with brains email us.

40:52.480 --> 40:56.000
All right, so you should email us too, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
And please be smart.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.400
Oh, dude, we got another email just as I was closing the box.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.080
They're already smart because they listen to this program.

41:04.080 --> 41:11.040
I'm going to read this now because it's by NintendoManiac64, worth a thousand words dot

41:11.040 --> 41:14.160
com, an entry into this internet porn tycoon.

41:14.160 --> 41:16.160
Oh, I get it.

41:16.160 --> 41:20.400
They've got a picture of that of somebody had already done this on this worth a thousand

41:20.400 --> 41:21.400
dot com.

41:21.400 --> 41:24.440
Somebody photoshopped railroad tycoons, this internet porn tycoon.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.440
There you go.

41:25.440 --> 41:26.440
That's awesome.

41:26.440 --> 41:27.440
Yeah.

41:27.440 --> 41:28.440
Thank you for sharing that with us, NintendoManiac64.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.440
Too bad it's not real.

41:30.440 --> 41:31.440
I know.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.120
Well, I can only hope.

41:33.120 --> 41:36.440
By microprobe, that's fantastic.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.960
That was, oh microprobes was the one that made it originally.

41:38.960 --> 41:40.960
I see what they did there.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.600
Yay, Photoshop.

41:42.600 --> 41:48.400
Anyways, so in the past PlayStation portable firmware has been defeated by Grand Theft

41:48.400 --> 41:56.280
Auto Liberty City Stories, and of course Sony went and apparently fixed the hole, or so

41:56.280 --> 41:58.000
they thought.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.080
Now people have found another way using Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, one of the

42:03.080 --> 42:07.600
original copies, that you can once again break the firmware.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.600
What have they done?

42:08.600 --> 42:09.640
Yep, they've done it.

42:09.640 --> 42:15.720
They've made their wonderful Hello World proof of concept thing, and even today, which just

42:15.720 --> 42:21.480
got released, a downgrader for firmware 3.03, so try as you might Sony, you'll just never

42:21.480 --> 42:22.480
win.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.600
Never, ever.

42:23.600 --> 42:27.720
So this is why consoles shouldn't have firmwares.

42:27.720 --> 42:32.480
They should just be good to go instead of having to upgrade.

42:32.480 --> 42:34.820
What's the big deal about homebrew on the PSP anyway?

42:34.820 --> 42:36.160
Is it really that bad?

42:36.160 --> 42:38.080
Is it really killing families across America?

42:38.080 --> 42:41.040
Is it really something that has to be prevented at all costs?

42:41.040 --> 42:42.040
No.

42:42.040 --> 42:44.720
In fact, they're encouraging it on the PlayStation 3, but that's still been...

42:44.720 --> 42:48.200
People are going to pirate the, you know, they're going to break the firmware to pirate

42:48.200 --> 42:49.200
shit, so...

42:49.200 --> 42:52.720
I was reading somewhere else that HD DVD, of course, you know, they finally had to admit

42:52.720 --> 42:54.240
that yes, it's been cracked.

42:54.240 --> 42:55.240
Hey Rob.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.240
What?

42:56.240 --> 42:58.440
This kick to your ass is courtesy of DMN.

42:58.440 --> 42:59.440
What?

42:59.440 --> 43:00.440
Yep.

43:00.440 --> 43:03.200
Tell DMN to go suck on a...

43:03.200 --> 43:07.160
Anyway, I wanted to just say really quickly, and then we're going to get into the Skype

43:07.160 --> 43:10.600
line and hear what you guys have to say, and play a voicemail.

43:10.600 --> 43:12.400
We got one voicemail this week that's pretty interesting.

43:12.400 --> 43:13.400
I want you guys to hear it.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.160
I want to say this real quickly.

43:15.160 --> 43:20.600
You might remember when Halo 2 was first coming out and was being promoted very heavily, they

43:20.600 --> 43:25.840
used a viral site to promote it, and it was called ilovebees.com was the name of the site.

43:25.840 --> 43:26.840
Well, guess what?

43:26.840 --> 43:32.000
It's back, and kind of convenient, don't you think, because Halo 3 is coming out before

43:32.000 --> 43:36.200
too long, and the beta is happening pretty soon?

43:36.200 --> 43:37.200
Makes you think.

43:37.200 --> 43:38.200
But bees are great.

43:38.200 --> 43:39.200
Well, if you love bees...

43:39.200 --> 43:41.880
They give us honey and sting us.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.760
And then they die when they sting you.

43:43.760 --> 43:45.680
If you love bees, check out the site.

43:45.680 --> 43:46.680
It's ilovebees.com.

43:46.680 --> 43:50.660
All right, we're going to get into the Skype line and take some of your calls here live

43:50.660 --> 43:54.480
on Orange Lounge Radio, but first, I want to play a voicemail that came into our line

43:54.480 --> 43:57.600
this week, and of course, we always invite your voicemails on any topic.

43:57.600 --> 44:02.920
You can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR when we're not live, or for those of you guys

44:02.920 --> 44:05.880
outside the US or Canada where that number is toll free, you can always give us a call

44:05.880 --> 44:07.300
on the Skype line.

44:07.300 --> 44:10.640
Just download Skype and call username Orange Lounge Radio.

44:10.640 --> 44:13.800
That's us, and you can leave us a message throughout the week, but keep in mind if you

44:13.800 --> 44:15.640
call right now, you're probably going to get on the Skype line.

44:15.640 --> 44:18.160
We'll take you live on air, but if you're the type that likes to formulate your thoughts

44:18.160 --> 44:23.260
first and then leave us a voicemail, you can do that, or sometimes we get other craziness

44:23.260 --> 44:27.040
on our voicemail line, and I mean craziness, so check this out, because this is pretty

44:27.040 --> 44:28.040
crazy.

44:28.040 --> 44:30.600
You might have to listen kind of carefully, because they talk fast, because you can definitely

44:30.600 --> 44:33.440
sense there's a lot of excitement in the room, so check this out.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.680
Hey, Rob, it's me.

44:35.680 --> 44:38.680
I just finished the free spot call, so it was awesome.

44:38.680 --> 44:40.680
It was a surprise for you, hold on.

44:40.680 --> 44:42.680
Yeah, Rob, this is Sheriff for Free Spot.

44:42.680 --> 44:43.680
What's going on, man?

44:43.680 --> 44:44.680
Adam and I are just chatting, and we're like, wait, what is this?

44:44.680 --> 44:45.680
Is he going to show up tonight?

44:45.680 --> 44:46.680
I don't know.

44:46.680 --> 44:47.680
We don't know.

44:47.680 --> 44:48.680
Is he going to fly in?

44:48.680 --> 44:49.680
I don't know.

44:49.680 --> 44:50.680
Is he going to fly in tonight?

44:50.680 --> 44:51.680
I don't know.

44:51.680 --> 44:52.680
We're looking for helicopters, you know, here.

44:52.680 --> 44:53.680
Anyway, this is Sheriff for Free Spot.

44:53.680 --> 44:54.680
Hope you're doing well.

44:54.680 --> 44:55.680
Rock out.

44:55.680 --> 44:56.680
Have a good time.

44:56.680 --> 44:57.680
Guitar Hero, Fun Times, Anime.

44:57.680 --> 44:58.680
Good times all around, yeah.

44:58.680 --> 44:59.680
Free spot.

44:59.680 --> 45:00.680
Go, go, go.

45:00.680 --> 45:01.680
Here's Adam again.

45:01.680 --> 45:02.680
He's got something he has to say.

45:02.680 --> 45:03.680
Enjoy your voice, man.

45:03.680 --> 45:08.680
I'll be listening to him on Sunday, live in the chat later.

45:08.680 --> 45:09.680
Thanks, hold on.

45:09.680 --> 45:13.880
Okay, let me translate, because those guys talked faster than the Micro Machines guy.

45:13.880 --> 45:18.480
That apparently was Sean from Freeze Pop leaving the message, because Rama went to the concert

45:18.480 --> 45:22.480
in New York City the other night and got them to leave a message.

45:22.480 --> 45:25.200
He texted me on my phone while I was in school.

45:25.200 --> 45:26.200
That's funny.

45:26.200 --> 45:31.680
See, sometimes we get craziness on the voicemail line, so I encourage you folks, program the

45:31.680 --> 45:34.600
1-877-GAME-OLR into your cell phone.

45:34.600 --> 45:40.560
When you come across internet celebrities such as this guy from Freeze Pop, then you

45:40.560 --> 45:47.080
should have them call in and leave us crazy voicemails, because, you know, that's fun.

45:47.080 --> 45:50.720
All right, we're going to open up our Skype line.

45:50.720 --> 45:56.120
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or its username, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

45:56.120 --> 46:00.600
We want to offer up you guys to interact with our program here on Orange Lounge Radio, because

46:00.600 --> 46:03.240
you know, it doesn't have to be all about us.

46:03.240 --> 46:04.240
I mean, to some extent.

46:04.240 --> 46:05.240
It could be all about me.

46:05.240 --> 46:08.760
To some extent it does have to be all about us, but we want it to be about you guys as

46:08.760 --> 46:09.760
well.

46:09.760 --> 46:14.400
So give us a call right now on the Skype line and we'll take some calls.

46:14.400 --> 46:15.720
Let's start off with this call tonight.

46:15.720 --> 46:19.200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

46:19.200 --> 46:20.200
This is D.M.N.

46:20.200 --> 46:21.760
San's really crappy microphone.

46:21.760 --> 46:22.760
Hi, D.M.N.

46:22.760 --> 46:24.160
San's really crappy microphone.

46:24.160 --> 46:27.600
Hey, I'm going to kick your ass next time I see you.

46:27.600 --> 46:29.600
Bring it, motherfucker.

46:29.600 --> 46:30.600
What?

46:30.600 --> 46:37.240
Oh, wow, I'm just reading in the chatroom, apparently 2DX Gold is supposed to be at Konami

46:37.240 --> 46:39.680
Gamers' Day, which we're going to next week.

46:39.680 --> 46:40.680
That's pretty hot.

46:40.680 --> 46:41.680
Oh, really?

46:41.680 --> 46:42.680
I don't know where the hell that came from.

46:42.680 --> 46:45.400
Somebody just blurted that out in chat.

46:45.400 --> 46:46.760
Can somebody back that up?

46:46.760 --> 46:47.760
I wouldn't doubt it.

46:47.760 --> 46:48.760
Oh, no, I see.

46:48.760 --> 46:52.280
Mecklar, oh, and 2DX Gold is going over to America, left the UK a day ago.

46:52.280 --> 46:53.600
Not sure where it's going, though.

46:53.600 --> 46:57.040
You guys got any big conventions or game shows soon, and Jason put it together that it must

46:57.040 --> 46:59.200
be coming over to Konami Gamers' Day.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.200
It's pretty hot.

47:00.200 --> 47:01.200
It's coming to Sakura Con.

47:01.200 --> 47:02.200
That's where it's going.

47:02.200 --> 47:03.200
I'm so planning to go spread your socks.

47:03.200 --> 47:04.200
We'll see what happens.

47:04.200 --> 47:05.200
I don't know.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.200
I don't know what's going to happen.

47:06.200 --> 47:07.800
We're going to have a full report on Konami Gamers' Day next week, and keep an eye on

47:07.800 --> 47:11.560
our website Thursday and Friday.

47:11.560 --> 47:14.960
All the news that we get there is embargoed until a certain time, but the minute that

47:14.960 --> 47:19.000
embargo's up, we're going to post a ton of shit from the show, so we're really excited.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.280
Anyway, D.M.N., what's on your mind tonight?

47:22.280 --> 47:23.280
Three things.

47:23.280 --> 47:27.560
One, huge STFU announcement this coming week.

47:27.560 --> 47:29.400
This is your Thursday night program, yes?

47:29.400 --> 47:30.400
Yes.

47:30.400 --> 47:31.760
Not this week, but next week.

47:31.760 --> 47:35.760
We're going to have MC Frontalot on the show for five good minutes.

47:35.760 --> 47:36.960
I hate you!

47:36.960 --> 47:38.920
No you don't.

47:38.920 --> 47:39.920
I knew Jamie would be pissed.

47:39.920 --> 47:44.160
Tell him to say something for me and record it, please.

47:44.160 --> 47:45.760
How about we Skype you in?

47:45.760 --> 47:46.760
You can talk to him.

47:46.760 --> 47:47.760
I have school.

47:47.760 --> 47:49.840
I have no problem with that.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.440
When are you guys taping it?

47:51.440 --> 47:52.440
Because you don't do it live.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.440
When are you guys taping it?

47:53.440 --> 47:54.440
I don't know.

47:54.440 --> 47:57.760
I don't know if you posted, but I'll kick Jimmy to the curb and you can interview with

47:57.760 --> 47:58.760
me.

47:58.760 --> 47:59.760
There you go.

47:59.760 --> 48:02.080
I have school every night this week, dude.

48:02.080 --> 48:03.080
It's not this week.

48:03.080 --> 48:04.080
It's next week.

48:04.080 --> 48:05.080
Oh.

48:05.080 --> 48:08.240
Why don't your people talk to his people and see what you can come up with?

48:08.240 --> 48:09.240
My people will talk to your people.

48:09.240 --> 48:10.240
All right.

48:10.240 --> 48:11.240
Maybe we can get him on this show.

48:11.240 --> 48:13.200
Well, anyway, so that's exciting news for you guys.

48:13.200 --> 48:15.160
You guys are getting more celebrities than we are.

48:15.160 --> 48:16.160
What the fuck?

48:16.160 --> 48:20.000
We've been around for five years.

48:20.000 --> 48:24.840
You guys are on like nine weeks and you're having frickin'... fuck you.

48:24.840 --> 48:25.840
All right.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.480
I love you too, Rob.

48:27.480 --> 48:29.440
Did you just call to rub it in or is there anything else you want to share?

48:29.440 --> 48:30.440
No.

48:30.440 --> 48:31.440
I actually had two things.

48:31.440 --> 48:35.600
One, I have a review of Bookworm Adventures.

48:35.600 --> 48:37.640
Dude, Bookworm Adventures is awesome.

48:37.640 --> 48:38.640
Yes.

48:38.640 --> 48:39.640
Dude, you're almost playing that.

48:39.640 --> 48:44.040
Pretty much the greatest casual game ever made.

48:44.040 --> 48:45.880
That's what Xbox Live needs.

48:45.880 --> 48:49.840
It's 30 bucks for the full version and that sounds kind of steep.

48:49.840 --> 48:51.200
I would play that.

48:51.200 --> 48:52.200
So I have a keyboard?

48:52.200 --> 48:53.760
Yeah, but not everyone does.

48:53.760 --> 48:57.880
Well, fuck them.

48:57.880 --> 48:59.440
It's 30 bucks for the full version.

48:59.440 --> 49:02.640
It's a bit steep, but very much worth it.

49:02.640 --> 49:04.840
Exciting.

49:04.840 --> 49:07.960
Is there any particular reason you love Bookworm Adventures?

49:07.960 --> 49:10.680
Is it the smarts you get to use in constructing words?

49:10.680 --> 49:11.680
Is it the graphics?

49:11.680 --> 49:13.360
What is it about the game?

49:13.360 --> 49:16.440
It's that and it's the charm.

49:16.440 --> 49:21.240
The game makes this really crazy deep voice like a voiceover guy.

49:21.240 --> 49:23.400
If you beat the crap out of an enemy, it's like CRUSHED.

49:23.400 --> 49:25.400
It's pretty cool.

49:25.400 --> 49:30.160
Can you do that one more time, please?

49:30.160 --> 49:31.160
CRUSHED.

49:31.160 --> 49:32.160
That's pretty awesome.

49:32.160 --> 49:35.120
Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, DMN?

49:35.120 --> 49:36.520
Yeah, bonus segment.

49:36.520 --> 49:37.720
I wanted to talk about that.

49:37.720 --> 49:43.440
I know the podcast listeners didn't hear it, but I actually can totally sympathize with

49:43.440 --> 49:48.440
that one lady because I just broke up with my girlfriend over WoW.

49:48.440 --> 49:49.440
Really?

49:49.440 --> 49:54.520
I remember calling her or you or the both of you during Guys on a Show one night.

49:54.520 --> 49:58.400
No, it wasn't Guys on a Show, it was this show when I was really fucking plastic.

49:58.400 --> 49:59.400
Oh, that's right.

49:59.400 --> 50:00.400
When you called in here drunk.

50:00.400 --> 50:03.320
So, you guys broke up over WoW?

50:03.320 --> 50:04.320
What happened?

50:04.320 --> 50:05.320
Over WoW.

50:05.320 --> 50:12.600
Well, one, I came over to visit her several weeks ago and she decided that playing WoW

50:12.600 --> 50:17.320
and raiding was more important than spending time with me and that kind of pissed me off.

50:17.320 --> 50:21.680
And then I called her earlier this week to see if she wanted to do something and she's

50:21.680 --> 50:23.840
like, no, I'm playing Burning Crusade, I'm trying to get 70.

50:23.840 --> 50:25.620
I'm like, okay, you know what?

50:25.620 --> 50:26.620
That's it.

50:26.620 --> 50:28.200
I'm done with this shit.

50:28.200 --> 50:29.200
What do you want?

50:29.200 --> 50:32.080
Do you want level 70 or cock?

50:32.080 --> 50:33.080
You need to make a decision.

50:33.080 --> 50:35.360
Is that what you told her?

50:35.360 --> 50:39.960
Just like, you know, you find WoW more important than, you know, hanging out with me and I

50:39.960 --> 50:43.120
care about you and I do all this shit for you.

50:43.120 --> 50:44.440
That's how I would break it down.

50:44.440 --> 50:48.720
I would say, you know, if I was having this problem in a relationship, I would say, look,

50:48.720 --> 50:55.160
do you want level 70 or do you want the cock because you can't have both.

50:55.160 --> 50:58.200
I game and I get laid when I want it.

50:58.200 --> 50:59.200
All right.

50:59.200 --> 51:00.300
Well, aren't you?

51:00.300 --> 51:01.880
That's because you married a nerd.

51:01.880 --> 51:02.880
Yes, I did.

51:02.880 --> 51:03.880
It's great.

51:03.880 --> 51:04.880
All right.

51:04.880 --> 51:05.880
DMN, anything else you want to share?

51:05.880 --> 51:06.880
We got to let some other people on.

51:06.880 --> 51:07.880
You need to tell Robbie Parks like an asshole.

51:07.880 --> 51:11.520
Yeah, Rob, your parking sucks.

51:11.520 --> 51:12.520
Really?

51:12.520 --> 51:13.520
Why does my parking suck?

51:13.520 --> 51:14.520
Okay.

51:14.520 --> 51:15.520
When I was down...

51:15.520 --> 51:16.520
Oops.

51:16.520 --> 51:17.520
We lost the connection.

51:17.520 --> 51:24.400
If you would like to call us, our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype or you can give

51:24.400 --> 51:25.400
us a call.

51:25.400 --> 51:30.560
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

51:30.560 --> 51:32.280
That's toll free in the United States.

51:32.280 --> 51:34.840
Hey, Rob, can't hang up on me.

51:34.840 --> 51:36.960
No, but I can unplug your mic.

51:36.960 --> 51:40.320
Yeah, and I can steal yours and beat you in the head with it.

51:40.320 --> 51:41.320
What was that, Jamie?

51:41.320 --> 51:42.320
No, you...

51:42.320 --> 51:43.320
Nope.

51:43.320 --> 51:44.320
Ow, ow.

51:44.320 --> 51:49.840
Damn it, her mic is like hardwired in that fucking mix board.

51:49.840 --> 51:55.560
That's because my powerful, awesome voice has fused it there.

51:55.560 --> 51:57.520
I totally owned Rob.

51:57.520 --> 51:58.520
Whatever.

51:58.520 --> 52:02.200
I'm sorry if I broke your arm.

52:02.200 --> 52:03.200
You hurt.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.200
You'll just have to give me a free massage.

52:05.200 --> 52:12.160
You'll just have to give me a free massage from MassageTheRapist.com.

52:12.160 --> 52:13.160
Rob!

52:13.160 --> 52:17.080
I take my professions seriously.

52:17.080 --> 52:20.920
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

52:20.920 --> 52:21.920
Who's this?

52:21.920 --> 52:22.920
Legend of Zaku.

52:22.920 --> 52:23.920
Hi, Legend of Zaku.

52:23.920 --> 52:25.920
What's on your mind, buddy?

52:25.920 --> 52:32.200
All that 2DX stuff that I've been hearing from over the pond.

52:32.200 --> 52:33.200
Over the pond?

52:33.200 --> 52:37.680
Yeah, that whole Ghostbusters thing that kind of shocked us last week.

52:37.680 --> 52:38.680
Remember?

52:38.680 --> 52:41.320
Yeah, yeah, okay.

52:41.320 --> 52:42.320
What about it?

52:42.320 --> 52:46.560
No, I'm just saying, you know, from what I've been hearing, Konami Gamers Day might have

52:46.560 --> 52:47.560
gold.

52:47.560 --> 52:48.560
I don't...

52:48.560 --> 52:49.560
I just want, you know...

52:49.560 --> 52:50.560
You know what?

52:50.560 --> 52:51.560
You know what?

52:51.560 --> 52:56.360
I'm not going to this event to, you know, to play all the cool stuff.

52:56.360 --> 52:59.940
I'm going to, you know, hear what is coming out so I can report back to all you guys what

52:59.940 --> 53:00.940
sounds cool.

53:00.940 --> 53:01.940
Exactly.

53:01.940 --> 53:02.940
If it's there, it's there.

53:02.940 --> 53:03.940
Loki will, too.

53:03.940 --> 53:06.880
Dark Soccer, unfortunately, is unable to attend because of school, but we'll give you our

53:06.880 --> 53:10.000
thoughts.

53:10.000 --> 53:15.640
You also know that Betsun mentioned in a press release that they're supposed to be having,

53:15.640 --> 53:16.640
you know...

53:16.640 --> 53:20.400
One of their top guys said that they're supposed to be having a content update for Supernova

53:20.400 --> 53:23.600
that's supposed to have two to three hundred more songs into it.

53:23.600 --> 53:27.600
Two to three hundred more songs than DDR Supernova in the arcade?

53:27.600 --> 53:29.080
Show Betsun press release.

53:29.080 --> 53:30.080
Wow.

53:30.080 --> 53:31.480
Well, who knows?

53:31.480 --> 53:32.680
This could be something they're announcing.

53:32.680 --> 53:35.640
I think Konami's gearing up for lots of announcements this week.

53:35.640 --> 53:39.520
They've been kind of quiet, so I think we're going to get just blasted with stuff.

53:39.520 --> 53:43.560
I think if that is true, you'll hear about it Thursday.

53:43.560 --> 53:48.480
If you don't hear about it then, or Friday, I don't know when the news is embargoed, but

53:48.480 --> 53:53.240
Thursday or Friday, if you don't hear after that, it probably wasn't true.

53:53.240 --> 53:54.960
But I could do it right now.

53:54.960 --> 53:55.960
Watch.

53:55.960 --> 53:56.960
I'll post it up on chat.

53:56.960 --> 53:57.960
Yeah.

53:57.960 --> 53:58.960
There we go.

53:58.960 --> 54:04.720
Well, okay, but how often are things talked about that don't necessarily happen, such

54:04.720 --> 54:06.560
as Link Mode?

54:06.560 --> 54:10.360
Well, that was never the best since its fall.

54:10.360 --> 54:14.600
That was because they got shafted by the people that were supposed to make the part for them.

54:14.600 --> 54:20.160
And so, you know, I was disappointed at first, but I let that slide because obviously, you

54:20.160 --> 54:23.580
know, I have faith that Konami might find another way.

54:23.580 --> 54:25.440
But if they don't, so be it.

54:25.440 --> 54:28.480
I mean, they'll eventually find an alternative.

54:28.480 --> 54:32.320
I mean, now, right now, probably in the next.

54:32.320 --> 54:33.320
Right.

54:33.320 --> 54:36.200
You've been playing anything else besides Bomani lately?

54:36.200 --> 54:39.440
More on the Groove R21, and I just played Drummania today.

54:39.440 --> 54:40.440
Okay, let me rephrase.

54:40.440 --> 54:44.880
Have you been playing anything that is not a music game?

54:44.880 --> 54:46.280
I started playing Initial D today.

54:46.280 --> 54:47.280
All right.

54:47.280 --> 54:48.280
There you go.

54:48.280 --> 54:49.280
That's something.

54:49.280 --> 54:50.280
And in the arcade?

54:50.280 --> 54:51.280
Yeah.

54:51.280 --> 54:52.280
I bought the card and everything.

54:52.280 --> 54:53.280
How is that?

54:53.280 --> 54:54.880
Is there a lot of competition in your neck of the woods?

54:54.880 --> 54:57.240
I actually traveled out of state today.

54:57.240 --> 54:59.960
It was a tournament, so I managed to play, you know.

54:59.960 --> 55:04.080
In addition to other stuff, I just played, you know, I managed to get into Initial D

55:04.080 --> 55:05.080
while I was at it.

55:05.080 --> 55:06.080
So yeah.

55:06.080 --> 55:12.920
I mean, it wasn't that much, but it's really hard to find an Initial D machine in Chinatown

55:12.920 --> 55:13.920
anyways.

55:13.920 --> 55:17.440
I know one place, but I will make efforts to follow up on that.

55:17.440 --> 55:18.440
All right.

55:18.440 --> 55:19.440
All right.

55:19.440 --> 55:22.480
Well, Zaku, your voice is breaking up a little bit, but thanks so much for calling in, as

55:22.480 --> 55:23.480
you always do.

55:23.480 --> 55:25.480
And we'll talk to you another time already.

55:25.480 --> 55:26.480
All right.

55:26.480 --> 55:33.840
If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or it's username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

55:33.840 --> 55:37.320
If you're sick of the same old people calling in week after week, then you're not helping,

55:37.320 --> 55:40.480
because you're not calling us, so you should get on your telephone and give us a call right

55:40.480 --> 55:41.480
now.

55:41.480 --> 55:42.480
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

55:42.480 --> 55:45.680
Otherwise, it's going to be the same people get through every week.

55:45.680 --> 55:50.840
Or you can always leave us a voicemail, because I know some folks can't listen live on Sunday,

55:50.840 --> 55:54.480
and so they want to, you know, interact with us in other ways.

55:54.480 --> 55:56.640
I guess we'll do one more call.

55:56.640 --> 55:59.320
We'll go over to this one.

55:59.320 --> 56:00.720
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

56:00.720 --> 56:01.720
Who's this?

56:01.720 --> 56:02.720
It's Rama.

56:02.720 --> 56:03.720
What's up?

56:03.720 --> 56:04.720
How you guys doing?

56:04.720 --> 56:05.720
Hey, Rama.

56:05.720 --> 56:06.720
How you doing, baby?

56:06.720 --> 56:07.720
You've already been on the show today.

56:07.720 --> 56:08.720
Hi.

56:08.720 --> 56:09.720
Your voicemail.

56:09.720 --> 56:10.720
Well, I do.

56:10.720 --> 56:11.720
I can't help the show out.

56:11.720 --> 56:12.720
You know me.

56:12.720 --> 56:13.720
I love you guys and girls.

56:13.720 --> 56:14.720
I know.

56:14.720 --> 56:15.720
It was cool.

56:15.720 --> 56:16.720
Thanks a lot.

56:16.720 --> 56:17.720
That's fun.

56:17.720 --> 56:18.720
You know, we had FreezePop.

56:18.720 --> 56:21.200
At least we had Casson from FreezePop about a year ago on the show, and it was very nice.

56:21.200 --> 56:23.200
I wish them a lot of success.

56:23.200 --> 56:24.680
They're a good bunch.

56:24.680 --> 56:25.680
Sweetness.

56:25.680 --> 56:30.800
I also hope you like the voice while I left it on your personal line.

56:30.800 --> 56:31.800
You know what?

56:31.800 --> 56:33.800
It cut out.

56:33.800 --> 56:34.800
What was it supposed to be?

56:34.800 --> 56:37.480
Because, like, I heard, like, a couple notes, like, they were playing a song.

56:37.480 --> 56:40.760
Like, it sounded like they were starting to play a song, but it cut, like, you were obviously

56:40.760 --> 56:42.000
indoors because it cut out.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.680
What were you trying to leave?

56:44.680 --> 56:46.160
Let's talk more rock.

56:46.160 --> 56:47.160
Ah, okay.

56:47.160 --> 56:49.160
See, all I could hear, like, this is the voicemail.

56:49.160 --> 56:52.160
It was like, this is for you, Rob.

56:52.160 --> 56:56.120
And then that's all I could hear, and then it, like, went, you know, cell phone drop.

56:56.120 --> 56:58.840
You might need to switch carriers.

56:58.840 --> 57:01.400
Because when we played that, there were a few people that showed up with their Guitar

57:01.400 --> 57:02.400
Hero controllers.

57:02.400 --> 57:05.600
They moved towards the front and started, like, freestyling on the song.

57:05.600 --> 57:08.600
People showed up with their Guitar Hero controller to the FreezePop concert?

57:08.600 --> 57:09.600
Yes.

57:09.600 --> 57:13.720
One of my friends, Aaron, he got them to sign his controller.

57:13.720 --> 57:14.720
That's pretty hardcore.

57:14.720 --> 57:15.720
I like that, though.

57:15.720 --> 57:16.720
That's rad.

57:16.720 --> 57:17.720
Yeah.

57:17.720 --> 57:18.720
Definitely.

57:18.720 --> 57:19.720
All right.

57:19.720 --> 57:20.720
Well, anything else you want to share with us, Rama?

57:20.720 --> 57:22.280
Did you have a good time at the concert overall?

57:22.280 --> 57:23.280
Yes, I did.

57:23.280 --> 57:25.640
And I also picked up another video game.

57:25.640 --> 57:27.120
I got Elite Beat Agents.

57:27.120 --> 57:29.760
Ooh, Elite Beat Agents, one of my favorites from 2006.

57:29.760 --> 57:30.760
What'd you think?

57:30.760 --> 57:31.760
It's fun.

57:31.760 --> 57:38.200
It's not as easy than Oh and Don, but I'm enjoying it.

57:38.200 --> 57:41.400
Wait till it, the difficulty really ramps up as you go through it.

57:41.400 --> 57:42.880
Oh, I believe it.

57:42.880 --> 57:45.320
I'm trying to finish the last song on easy.

57:45.320 --> 57:46.320
All right.

57:46.320 --> 57:50.280
All right, well, Rama, thanks so much for the call, and thanks for the voicemails.

57:50.280 --> 57:51.280
We appreciate it.

57:51.280 --> 57:52.280
No problem.

57:52.280 --> 57:57.320
Hey, my friend, Patty, agrees with you, what you said about the whole Wii incident, just

57:57.320 --> 57:58.320
letting you know.

57:58.320 --> 57:59.320
All right.

57:59.320 --> 58:00.320
Cool.

58:00.320 --> 58:01.320
Thanks for the support.

58:01.320 --> 58:02.320
All right.

58:02.320 --> 58:03.320
Later.

58:03.320 --> 58:04.320
All right.

58:04.320 --> 58:05.320
Bye.

58:05.320 --> 58:06.320
All right.

58:06.320 --> 58:07.320
Thanks so much to all of our callers tonight.

58:07.320 --> 58:08.320
We appreciate it.

58:08.320 --> 58:09.320
If you didn't get through, that's okay.

58:09.320 --> 58:10.320
You can always leave us a voicemail.

58:10.320 --> 58:11.320
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR when we're not live.

58:11.320 --> 58:13.640
Now I'm going to open it up to any last-minute stories we have here in the studio.

58:13.640 --> 58:15.440
Any last-minute stories from anyone?

58:15.440 --> 58:16.720
Oh, yeah.

58:16.720 --> 58:17.720
Loki.

58:17.720 --> 58:23.000
Anyways, some interesting stuff for the PSP, including a brand-new game coming to it.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.160
This should get Jamie happy, or very happy here.

58:26.160 --> 58:27.160
Happity.

58:27.160 --> 58:28.160
Happity.

58:28.160 --> 58:29.160
Yes.

58:29.160 --> 58:30.160
Very happily.

58:30.160 --> 58:31.160
Yay.

58:31.160 --> 58:38.520
Dracula X, Rondo of Blood is coming to the PSP, according to UK-based gaming magazine

58:38.520 --> 58:39.520
Play.

58:39.520 --> 58:45.360
So that's kind of cool.

58:45.360 --> 58:53.000
Other stuff, though, if you're expecting Final Fantasy XIII this year, sorry to disappoint

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
you, but that's not happening.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Dream on.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
We can all do that.

58:56.000 --> 59:03.080
According to Tetsuya Nomura himself, said it's not going to happen, and says, I'm hoping

59:03.080 --> 59:09.360
to play, or hopefully going to be out in 2008.

59:09.360 --> 59:15.180
Yeah, and even that, they'll probably get it late 2008 in Japan, and then we won't get

59:15.180 --> 59:21.400
it here until 2009, which sucks, because that'll be when I get a PlayStation 3, that'll be

59:21.400 --> 59:22.400
2009.

59:22.400 --> 59:23.400
Yeah.

59:23.400 --> 59:29.800
According to Midway, because I know they've had their Midway's Gamer Day, was actually

59:29.800 --> 59:35.600
last week, they had some info regarding the Midway Classics that are going to be on the

59:35.600 --> 59:37.640
PlayStation Network.

59:37.640 --> 59:46.520
Of course, some of the pricing for that, Demon Slayer is going to be $4.99, and it should

59:46.520 --> 59:53.040
hit the PlayStation Store in the next few months, but it doesn't really say what are the other

59:53.040 --> 59:58.560
costs on, say for example, the Mortal Kombat games or anything like that.

59:58.560 --> 59:59.560
But they look good, though.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.280
They have some screenshots actually online now of Mortal Kombat, and Rampart, and Super

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:09.200
Sprint, stuff like that, so that's kind of cool.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.520
And then, I don't know what the hell this is, but apparently there's this homebrew program

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:22.520
called Mini VMac for the DS, where apparently they're running Mac OS on a DS, which is so

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.740
wrong, but okay.

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:32.100
And then, of course, a PlayStation 3 ISO loader is being worked on right now, and hopefully

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:40.840
it'll be done soon there in the testing phase, so piracy on the PlayStation 3 coming soon.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.720
I'm sure Sony's thrilled to hear that news.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.720
Oh yeah.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.760
DarkSakura, do you have anything for us, last minute?

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.120
No, I just have my usual awesome.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.840
All right, well then I guess that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.840
Radio.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.440
Hey guys, thanks so much for tuning in to us, downloading it, and supporting independent

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440
internet radio.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.280
We really appreciate it, and it is that support that keeps us going week after week.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.440
We'll see you back here next week with more Orange Launch Radio.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.240
I do believe there's some football game on TV, but we're not watching, so we'll be here

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:12.160
Sunday Night Live, 6 o'clock Pacific, to talk about more games.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:17.300
So until then, this is Rob Roberts for DarkSakura and Loki saying, see you next time here on

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:18.300
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.300
