00:00:14,246 --> 00:00:24,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, January 21st, 2007, more Final Fantasy XIII details emerge, new developments for the Guitar Hero series including Drum Villain, and can you fix a broken 360 with towels?

2
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:36,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:40,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I say welcome back because, you know, we missed a show last week, but we'll get into that in a moment.

4
00:00:40,517 --> 00:00:41,717
[SPEAKER_02]: First, let's introduce ourselves.

5
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:47,639
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know about, video game culture and the video game lifestyle.

6
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,099
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:52,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo, what up?

9
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,481
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, Ms.

10
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:54,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Summers?

11
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:55,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

12
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:58,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm alive, sort of.

13
00:00:58,327 --> 00:00:59,309
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good, that's good.

14
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a very good time last week on our weekend off with you.

15
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:03,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great time.

16
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself and DarkSakura and the OLR lesbians all went to Disneyland.

17
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:08,324
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good time.

18
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:10,267
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a very...

19
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:12,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting time.

20
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:17,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know some listeners sometimes give Jamie a hard time because she talks about Disneyland a lot on this show, and I'm one of them.

21
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:20,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I give her a hard time talking about Disneyland so much on this program.

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,761
[SPEAKER_02]: But I kind of get it now.

23
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:26,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I really had a great time, and it really is something else.

24
00:01:26,343 --> 00:01:28,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Mountain four times.

25
00:01:28,324 --> 00:01:30,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocking Space Mountain four times in a row was awesome.

26
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:31,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just really cool.

27
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:35,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that, you know, we have day jobs.

28
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:36,587
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR is not what we do for a living.

29
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:40,769
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's just kind of nice to have a week off to go have nothing but fun.

30
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what Disneyland was really all about, was just fun and good friends and good times.

31
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,151
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was great.

32
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:45,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a really good time.

33
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:46,871
[SPEAKER_02]: So group hug.

34
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:47,912
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

35
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:50,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, also joining us tonight, say hello to Loki.

36
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:50,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

37
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:52,314
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, Loki?

38
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:53,014
[SPEAKER_01]: How was your week off?

39
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:54,375
[SPEAKER_01]: It was okay.

40
00:01:54,855 --> 00:02:01,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to a friend's reception and we hung out there and...

41
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:03,958
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

42
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:32,456
[SPEAKER_02]: What made you... But you quit again.

43
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:33,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I quit again.

44
00:02:33,657 --> 00:02:36,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So what made you decide to start playing Final Fantasy XI and then quit again?

45
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:43,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I missed it, and then when I came back, I played it, and then I didn't miss it anymore, so it was time to cancel.

46
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:45,922
[SPEAKER_02]: What made you decide you did the right thing by quitting?

47
00:02:46,863 --> 00:02:48,163
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean, what made me decide?

48
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:55,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because you said you went back for two weeks, and then you quit, so obviously you must have come to the conclusion during those two weeks that, oh, I made the right decision quitting.

49
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:55,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

50
00:02:56,562 --> 00:03:12,898
[SPEAKER_03]: because being a blue mage is freaking boring trying to get those spells and when you spend two hours hunting this one monster trying to get one spell off of it you realize that your time could be better spent somewhere else like looking for a party alright

51
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:16,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the chat room comments here at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

52
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:19,747
[SPEAKER_02]: We always invite the chatters to always be another guest here on the program.

53
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:21,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have their comments.

54
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:23,209
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some really good voicemails this week, by the way.

55
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:27,272
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get to later on in Part B. And just another way we encourage you guys to interact with us.

56
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:32,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadowslayer says, just sat around and talked equals strippers.

57
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:33,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this true?

58
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:36,217
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's in his mom's coffee shop.

59
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:39,879
[SPEAKER_01]: So sitting around and talking is literally sitting around and talking.

60
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:41,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Lattes and strippers, good times.

61
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:42,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish.

62
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:42,961
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish.

63
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:48,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Nellie and I were hoping for strippers with fireworks and jetpacks.

64
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:53,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually almost got somebody to believe that that was going to happen, but they were an idiot, so it doesn't matter.

65
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,883
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be Kat, and she was an idiot.

66
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Does Kat listen to this program?

67
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Can she defend herself?

68
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think she knows how to operate a computer.

69
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,470
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a complete idiot.

70
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,051
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

71
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:11,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, welcome back, of course, to all of our live listeners and our podcast listeners since there was no program last week.

72
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:25,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we apologize for not being here, but now that the holidays are over and we're all back into our daily routine, unfortunately, we're kind of in a situation where Jamie's doing school in the early evenings and Loki has to go to bed early for his job, which takes out the late evenings.

73
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:28,282
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very hard for us to prerecord when we're not here on Sundays.

74
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:29,803
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry about that, but that's what happened.

75
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:37,612
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were here listening live, though, Travis Donovan from our Saturday night program on Orange Lounge Radio did a real fantastic little tribute program.

76
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:47,164
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you listen to one of our buddy podcasts, All Games Interactive, DarkSakura and I appeared on the Friday edition, and it was something else.

77
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:50,155
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good time, though.

78
00:05:13,857 --> 00:05:22,457
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good time, I had a really good time Thanks to Scott for having us on It's good, I like doing radio with Scott Because he plays such different types of games than we do

79
00:05:23,254 --> 00:05:24,515
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

80
00:05:52,654 --> 00:05:53,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

81
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:27,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Astro Blasters is one of the best video games I've ever played in my life.

82
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:28,995
[SPEAKER_02]: That was some good times.

83
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:32,256
[SPEAKER_05]: And we might be getting another pinball machine that you would be interested in.

84
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:33,676
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

85
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:34,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Bride of Pinbot.

86
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:35,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

87
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:36,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

88
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:37,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I told Dan to try to get it for me.

89
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:39,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of console stuff otherwise?

90
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:40,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

91
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:46,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost got rid of PSU and then went, meh.

92
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I turned on Guild Wars and then said, meh.

93
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:57,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Just when it went through the whole booting and patching and that whole process, you were like, eh, nah.

94
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much.

95
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:00,041
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

96
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:00,861
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, good times.

97
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:02,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

98
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:04,043
[SPEAKER_01]: My gaming week was good.

99
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:22,491
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a gaming party last night, actually, and Rob was there, and he can attest to the fact WarioWare Smooth Moves is fun, but playing it with 11 people at the same time is crazy, and it adds a whole new element of fun into it that

100
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:30,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I have never had a video gaming experience quite like 11-player WarioWare.

101
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to describe it.

102
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:33,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It was insanity.

103
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:38,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you guys know, in WarioWare, you only get to use one baton.

104
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:40,816
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it the baton in the game, but it's Wiimote.

105
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,708
[SPEAKER_02]: You only get to use one Wiimote in multiplayer.

106
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,550
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of the... And you might say, no, that's stupid.

107
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't they make it four?

108
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:51,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the fun of it was actually passing off the baton in time to other people.

109
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:52,613
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually kind of funny.

110
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:54,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the whole thing is ridiculous.

111
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:57,736
[SPEAKER_01]: They have your Miis flying around like this angel form.

112
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,758
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, it really looks weird.

113
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:07,562
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have all these weird Miifaces with this angel body thing that doesn't even fit.

114
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:08,222
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have

115
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:12,226
[SPEAKER_01]: These games that you're playing keeps getting faster, and everyone was just cracking up.

116
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:13,467
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a lot of fun.

117
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:16,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you notice how OLR totally dominated the multiplayer games?

118
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:20,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you won one, Miklatov won one, Extrofer won one, and I won one.

119
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:21,673
[SPEAKER_02]: We played it four times.

120
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:22,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we play games more than that.

121
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:23,234
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know.

122
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:23,634
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

123
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:25,316
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did that.

124
00:08:25,356 --> 00:08:26,336
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really fun.

125
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:30,820
[SPEAKER_02]: But that just goes to say, at this gamer party, you had some, would you say, casual gamers there?

126
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,843
[SPEAKER_02]: What were the level of people like Tiffany and Heather and the other Rob...

127
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:36,623
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

128
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:01,074
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's funny.

129
00:09:01,094 --> 00:09:04,215
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Mel, of course, you know, plays some stuff.

130
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:08,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, everyone plays, you know, pretty average amount of games and stuff.

131
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:12,238
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a lot of people, you know, really liked it.

132
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:17,980
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, definitely people that were going to get a Wii are probably going to get this game as well because it's just crazy.

133
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,001
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dance mini game was hilarious.

134
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Shane shared this idea with us that you can do the dance.

135
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:31,657
[SPEAKER_02]: You go into the mode where you just play a minigame over and over again, and you do the dance minigame, but you set it on the fastest setting.

136
00:09:32,057 --> 00:09:32,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty funny.

137
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:33,338
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun to watch.

138
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:34,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's crazy.

139
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,123
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we played Resistance Fallen Man.

140
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:42,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing that all week during lunches, and we played that last night, too, for a while.

141
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:45,788
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a really interesting glitch after you left.

142
00:09:46,438 --> 00:09:47,699
[SPEAKER_01]: We were playing multiplayer.

143
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,084
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we started off with just, you know, doing four-player multiplayer and stuff, and that's a fun game, multiplayer.

144
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:59,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we decided, rockets only, infinite ammo, and so, and we picked really tiny maps, and that was pretty fun.

145
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Except one part, um, I... Sounds like the Halo 2 games I played online, yeah.

146
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:08,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Except one time, I spawned, and I just kept flying up into the air, so it was really weird.

147
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:10,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was kind of funny.

148
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:10,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And then...

149
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:13,489
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys were playing Red Steel at one point too.

150
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,629
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

151
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:58,020
[SPEAKER_01]: and so 4Player, I thought it'd be cool if we tried the mode where the Wiimote rings like a phone and you pick it up and you get a mission from the person on the line.

152
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:03,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a cool concept, but it's completely annoying and stupid at the same time.

153
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:05,145
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

154
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,949
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is the last draw for this game.

155
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:26,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely selling it back now.

156
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was a complete waste of money in the first place.

157
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,890
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an utter disappointment.

158
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to give it a second chance, and so I did, and it's awful.

159
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,932
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first time you asked me, like, do you want to play this?

160
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:38,853
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, I don't.

161
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:41,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, you know, that really sucked.

162
00:11:41,774 --> 00:11:44,915
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I'm trying to think what else we played there.

163
00:11:46,495 --> 00:11:47,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob D. in chat agrees with you.

164
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:49,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's right, phone mode sucks.

165
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:51,777
[SPEAKER_02]: It always rings, you can't hear it, it's lame, and I hate it.

166
00:11:52,838 --> 00:12:00,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sounded like a cool concept in the beginning, you know, when they were talking about it, but it's just horribly, horribly executed.

167
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:02,926
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I can't recommend that game at all.

168
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:10,271
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, finally, I've been playing more Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, which I hear is now coming out on the PlayStation 2.

169
00:12:10,591 --> 00:12:13,353
[SPEAKER_01]: My boss will be extremely happy about that.

170
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:15,755
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, you know, the usual stuff.

171
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:20,819
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, right now, WarioWare is going to have to hold me over until SSX comes out.

172
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:27,057
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of sucks with only one game coming out in a month, but that's about it.

173
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:28,078
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

174
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I make an interjection?

175
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, why not?

176
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:31,822
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one other game.

177
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:32,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what's that?

178
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:33,763
[SPEAKER_05]: R-Type 3.

179
00:12:34,824 --> 00:12:35,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, on the Virtual Console?

180
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:36,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

181
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:37,066
[SPEAKER_05]: How was that?

182
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:40,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I actually never had R-Type 3 before, so it was actually really fun.

183
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,074
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the Mode 7-tastic stuff that happens in it.

184
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:54,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess sort of mini-boss type things pop up.

185
00:12:54,968 --> 00:13:05,395
[SPEAKER_05]: You can kill him in one charge shot, and then another one comes up behind you, and then he swings around you, and then you bitch can't kill him, and then he suddenly looks behind him and runs into a wall and blows up.

186
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:07,493
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

187
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:33,146
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

188
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:08,834
[SPEAKER_03]: down to zero, everything except for Elite Beats on Jumping Jack Flash on Elite Beat D.Va's difficulty.

189
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:15,279
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see, I just picked up Final Fantasy 3 for the DS because it's in stock again, which is nice.

190
00:14:17,462 --> 00:14:21,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played Final Fantasy for two weeks, and now I'm playing Burning Crusade.

191
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:23,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

192
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:25,429
[SPEAKER_02]: How's Burning Crusade?

193
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:29,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Night Elf, or Night Elf, Blood Elf is really pretty and he jumps around and twirls.

194
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:30,137
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

195
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:32,778
[SPEAKER_02]: What made you decide to go on to Burning Crusade?

196
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:37,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody else is doing it and I like to follow people.

197
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,142
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm easily swayed.

198
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:42,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's fun.

199
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:43,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.

200
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:43,843
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.

201
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:44,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, good times.

202
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:46,564
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to tell people your server and characters?

203
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:47,544
[SPEAKER_02]: They can come play with you?

204
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:48,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Or would you rather stay anonymous?

205
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:49,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

206
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,926
[SPEAKER_03]: My server is... What is my server?

207
00:14:52,146 --> 00:14:53,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Ravencrest...

208
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:58,607
[SPEAKER_03]: and my character's name is Arx and I'm a 13 Blood Elf Priest.

209
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:00,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any reason why you chose a Ravencrest?

210
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:04,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it reminded me of Ravenclaw because that sounds like something Harry Potter-ish.

211
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:05,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

212
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:15,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, since you mentioned that Final Fantasy 3 is back in stock now, they've been actually sold out of a lot of stuff, especially the DS Lite.

213
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:17,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo is actually completely sold out now.

214
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:20,172
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be coming in stores in the next week or so.

215
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:21,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm finally catching up.

216
00:15:21,732 --> 00:15:22,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the Wii.

217
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:24,177
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been sold out for a while, too.

218
00:15:24,197 --> 00:15:27,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo's kind of slow right now.

219
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony's kind of showing them up with the amount of units they're getting out there, but no one's buying them.

220
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:37,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my gaming week, a lot of the same stuff most people have actually already beat me to and mentioned.

221
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,032
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was Buzz Lightyear ride at Disneyland, which was a lot of fun.

222
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:44,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what's weird is that the first time we went through it, we rode that ride three times, and the first time was our best score.

223
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,718
[SPEAKER_02]: We should post that picture on Orange Lounge somewhere.

224
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:47,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny.

225
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:51,282
[SPEAKER_02]: You got like the 38th best score for the day or something, the high score.

226
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:51,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

227
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:53,104
[SPEAKER_02]: You kicked my butt at it.

228
00:15:53,364 --> 00:15:56,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of how many thousands of people that...

229
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they do it by day.

230
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,971
[SPEAKER_05]: The only reason we got so high of a score, though, is because it broke down while we were on it.

231
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:09,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because the other times we never stopped in the middle of the ride.

232
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:10,813
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done really well on that ride.

233
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:13,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I can at least get to a rank four on a regular run through.

234
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:18,835
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I was chatting from the hotel room with Bobby over at All Games, and he's like, well, I got a million.

235
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:19,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get a million?

236
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, but his ride stopped too.

237
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:24,397
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

238
00:16:25,053 --> 00:16:26,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I played that.

239
00:16:26,213 --> 00:16:30,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've also, um, I've gone back to World of Warcraft, thanks to Burning Crusade.

240
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:32,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is funny, though, because I didn't buy Burning Crusade.

241
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:43,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just, I, I decided, I don't, there's not a lot in Burning Crusade for me, because I'm not all like, ooh, ah, over Blood Elves and Draenei, because everybody is playing those.

242
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:49,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if you look at the server that Shane and I are playing on, Rave, because we always start on a freaking new server, Ravencrest.

243
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:52,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing a tauren on Ravencrest.

244
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not writing into anybody.

245
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:55,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a new server.

246
00:16:55,833 --> 00:17:04,037
[SPEAKER_03]: All I see are blood elves and they're all paladins and they make me want to punch them because it's annoying because they all just kind of gang up on my kills I'm trying to get.

247
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's...

248
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:06,901
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.

249
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:10,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, well, there's not a lot in Burning Crusade for me.

250
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:11,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure, there's new areas.

251
00:17:11,984 --> 00:17:13,545
[SPEAKER_02]: You can level to 70 in the Jewelcrafting.

252
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:18,728
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, okay, I don't want to make that investment unless I actually stick with World of Warcraft.

253
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:21,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you've been listening to this show for a couple years, you know that I'm notorious.

254
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:26,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play World of Warcraft for three months, quit, then start over again in a couple months on a new server.

255
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:32,695
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I actually, I said, okay, Rob, if you can get a character to level 40, I will reward you by buying Burning Crusade.

256
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:33,995
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

257
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:35,136
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm already at what?

258
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:37,295
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

259
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

260
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:25,417
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

261
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:49,959
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

262
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:00,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

263
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:30,444
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're a Nintendo fanboy, you probably already own it, so what are you listening to me for?

264
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:32,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, would you agree with that, Loki?

265
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:50,237
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this whole thing kind of reminds me of, you know, there could be more life in this game if they had, I don't know, leaderboards or something like that supported on the Nintendo Wii, but since they don't, and Nintendo's a fucking retarded for not doing that, you know, there's not as much life as there could be.

266
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,079
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know, simple...

267
00:19:53,632 --> 00:19:53,933
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

268
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:02,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's about... Do I have anything else for my gaming week?

269
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:03,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

270
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:04,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just pretty much been playing those.

271
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot of... Oh, no, there is one new game I wanted to mention also.

272
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought Heavy Weapon on Xbox Live Arcade, which is a PopCap game.

273
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:13,952
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the folks that made Bejeweled and Zuma.

274
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:15,993
[SPEAKER_02]: But Heavy Weapon is a very different type of game.

275
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:16,773
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a puzzle game.

276
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:17,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of an action game.

277
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:19,834
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of an old 16-bit shooter.

278
00:20:20,415 --> 00:20:26,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people have been giving Heavy Weapon a lot of crap because, you know, they go, Oh, another PopCap game.

279
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:27,609
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out after Ms.

280
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:28,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Man.

281
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,792
[SPEAKER_02]: God, the live arcade lineup sucks.

282
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:34,576
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, well, I could play this on, you know, for free on Flash and da-da-da-da-da.

283
00:20:35,497 --> 00:20:39,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people are passing judgment on this game before playing it.

284
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:43,105
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would bet some of your favorite bloggers are doing this, too, after reading one and reading some bloggers.

285
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:47,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people were posting those types of opinions before the game even came out.

286
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:50,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were basing their opinions, I know this, off the Flash version of the game.

287
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:52,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

288
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

289
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:39,470
[SPEAKER_02]: If the website is good enough for you and you play the game with them, fine.

290
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you don't need to spend the $10.

291
00:21:41,391 --> 00:21:45,975
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you enjoy those types of games, I think you'd really benefit from multiplayer and some of the other modes this game has.

292
00:21:45,995 --> 00:21:53,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of fun with it and I kind of want to play it again when my TV's free of Elebits because Extifer's been playing Elebits nonstop.

293
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,241
[SPEAKER_02]: He beat it.

294
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:55,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the final boss in the game.

295
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:57,643
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like this Voltron Elebit type thing.

296
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.

297
00:21:59,104 --> 00:22:00,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know Elebits was so long.

298
00:22:00,805 --> 00:22:01,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it has like 25, 26 stages.

299
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:18,054
[SPEAKER_02]: and the stages in that game go on for like 10-20 minutes at a time so there's quite a bit of replayability in all of it so I was surprised so I do recommend Heavy Weapon for those fans of shooters at least even if you just have access to Xbox Live check out the demo you might like it so

300
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:19,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

301
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:41,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, just a reminder, we do have programming here on OrangeLawnTrader.com almost every weeknight throughout the week.

302
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:46,902
[SPEAKER_02]: First Tuesday of every month, DarkSakura is live with Pump Up the Volume, so she's due for a new show pretty soon.

303
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:49,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday nights, guys on a show, myself and Extover.

304
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:53,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday nights, STFU with DMN and DJ Tyrant.

305
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday night, Club OLR mixed by Loki.

306
00:22:55,984 --> 00:23:02,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And Saturday nights, Travis Donovan live, which is always pretty hilarious, and he does a lot of the chat room interaction stuff too.

307
00:23:02,106 --> 00:23:02,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So check those shows out.

308
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:05,075
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

309
00:23:26,244 --> 00:23:28,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge news happens literally in our backyard.

310
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:29,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean literally.

311
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:36,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, we're referring to the Hold Your Wii for a Wii contest that one of our local stations here, 1079, held.

312
00:23:37,554 --> 00:23:40,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Their morning rave show or whatever held this Hold Your Wii for a Wii contest.

313
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:47,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And, unfortunately, it ended, or I should say resulted, because it was about a couple hours after the contest ended, resulted in the death of

314
00:23:48,118 --> 00:23:52,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Jennifer Strange, a 28-year-old who was trying to win a Wii for her family.

315
00:23:52,883 --> 00:23:53,964
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very interesting.

316
00:23:54,004 --> 00:24:00,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Jennifer Strange lived not even about two miles from where we record Orange Lounge Radio.

317
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of weird, kind of hit home, that whole story.

318
00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:10,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And at first, I don't know about you guys when you heard about this, but at first I was kind of thinking, this isn't...

319
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:15,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was reading about it on, you know, Kotaku, Destructoid, and all those gaming blogs.

320
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking, this really isn't about gaming.

321
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:25,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I understand why these sites covered it, so I'm not trying to fault that or anything, but I'm kind of thinking to myself, we're really digging a hole for this.

322
00:24:25,526 --> 00:24:27,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not really about the gaming.

323
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:38,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure, it's a tragic story, but that goes more to the whole, where was the responsibility of the DJs, the station, the woman that competed in the contest, you know, all that types of back and forth.

324
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:39,353
[SPEAKER_02]: But then...

325
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:40,611
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

326
00:25:00,393 --> 00:25:01,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

327
00:25:16,992 --> 00:25:18,934
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thinking, okay, it's not really gaming related.

328
00:25:19,054 --> 00:25:21,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we should talk about it on Sunday's show because it's kind of been talked about to death.

329
00:25:22,257 --> 00:25:23,858
[SPEAKER_02]: But then this late-breaking thing happened.

330
00:25:23,878 --> 00:25:27,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught the news on Thursday, and I posted about this to OrangeLawnTrader.com.

331
00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:30,644
[SPEAKER_02]: We were watching local news, and they were talking about this whole thing.

332
00:25:30,884 --> 00:25:38,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the reporter, I guess, had talked to the lawyer, and the reporter said that they were considering expanding the lawsuit that was filed against the station.

333
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:41,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously, a civil lawsuit was filed in her death.

334
00:25:41,594 --> 00:25:42,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we all saw that coming.

335
00:25:43,235 --> 00:25:51,539
[SPEAKER_02]: The lawsuit is being considered to expand Nintendo and promoters for Justin Timberlake because Justin Timberlake's tickets were involved in this concert, too.

336
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,960
[SPEAKER_02]: They were in the contest, too.

337
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,040
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a consolation prize.

338
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:59,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's kind of, well, now we're kind of roping it back into gaming because Nintendo could get sued over this whole thing.

339
00:26:00,824 --> 00:26:01,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is stupid.

340
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:03,343
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really stupid.

341
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:04,423
[SPEAKER_05]: They had nothing to do with it.

342
00:26:04,503 --> 00:26:05,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.

343
00:26:05,604 --> 00:26:15,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, unless they can prove that Nintendo somehow sponsored this contest, which I doubt, I highly, highly, highly doubt they would sponsor a contest called Hold Your Wii for a Wii.

344
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:17,125
[SPEAKER_02]: They would have never done that, okay?

345
00:26:17,446 --> 00:26:24,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless they can somehow prove that Nintendo sponsored this contest, I don't see that really happening, that they're going to be able to sue them.

346
00:26:24,987 --> 00:26:26,867
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe that's what they're exploring right now.

347
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:27,147
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

348
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:31,908
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the lawyer would like to do because Nintendo is a large company and he thinks that he can get money from them, so...

349
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:38,177
[SPEAKER_01]: And although I can understand where her family is coming from, I mean, it was very tragic what happened to her, although I do believe she is partially to blame, I felt...

350
00:26:56,588 --> 00:26:59,630
[SPEAKER_02]: She was more to blame until I heard the audio of the whole thing.

351
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:06,494
[SPEAKER_02]: When I heard how crass the DJs were in talking about, you know, well, they signed waivers, what's the worst they've had, and the fact that people had called them.

352
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:12,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a co-worker who listened to it, and she was telling me at work about how the one doctor we all heard about was not the only one to call in.

353
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:18,060
[SPEAKER_02]: She said at least two doctors called in telling them not to do it, and they still continue to do it anyway.

354
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So while, yeah, I kind of fault her for participating, I think there's blame.

355
00:27:22,663 --> 00:27:23,763
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just tragic.

356
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:24,684
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing's tragic.

357
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:26,448
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

358
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:47,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, she deserves her Darwin Award.

359
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:56,268
[SPEAKER_05]: The DJs also, I think, were responsible for not thinking it through, for being pretty much, yeah, they were idiots.

360
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,450
[SPEAKER_05]: They also deserve to be Darwinized.

361
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet.

362
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:06,216
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think in kinda and sorta, I believe in every party was at fault.

363
00:28:06,817 --> 00:28:07,557
[SPEAKER_05]: She was at fault.

364
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:08,398
[SPEAKER_05]: She deserves it.

365
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:09,682
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

366
00:28:28,347 --> 00:28:35,309
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they probably didn't know that it was, you know, I mean, because it's basically, okay, who can hold it the longest before they have to go.

367
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:36,649
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't the issue.

368
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:39,950
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't because she held back her urine that she died.

369
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,831
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because she drank, like, gallons and gallons of water really quick.

370
00:28:44,451 --> 00:28:48,653
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wouldn't have mattered even if she went afterwards, because I'm assuming she did go afterwards.

371
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:50,153
[SPEAKER_01]: The damage was already done.

372
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:53,427
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, now they had them fill out waivers.

373
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:57,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they have generic waivers at the radio stations to have people fill out for their contests.

374
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:00,270
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically saying, oh, we don't hold you liable for this and this.

375
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:14,717
[SPEAKER_01]: But they didn't disclose, at least it seems like from what I've heard on the radio and stuff, the recordings of it, they didn't really disclose what possible dangers were and say you might die from this if there's too much or something like that.

376
00:29:15,877 --> 00:29:20,199
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think they did the research, or if they did, they just completely shrugged it off

377
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,583
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what the issue is.

378
00:29:22,643 --> 00:29:24,964
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a matter of, you know, if they signed waivers or not.

379
00:29:24,984 --> 00:29:29,767
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just they didn't disclose the possible risks, you know, of participating in this activity.

380
00:29:29,787 --> 00:29:34,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Because not everyone, you know, is aware that, you know, drinking that much water could cause you to die.

381
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,632
[SPEAKER_01]: You would just think that you'd just have to really go to the bathroom really bad.

382
00:29:38,873 --> 00:29:44,656
[SPEAKER_01]: So with a lot of these people not knowing, I mean, you can't really hold them responsible for that.

383
00:29:44,856 --> 00:29:46,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, it's a stupid thing, but hey.

384
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:47,478
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

385
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:08,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought they said that she stopped when she did feel sick.

386
00:30:08,784 --> 00:30:11,526
[SPEAKER_02]: She did quit the contest.

387
00:30:11,847 --> 00:30:14,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I read about it, I didn't know about water poisoning.

388
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:16,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, okay, that's crazy.

389
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,511
[SPEAKER_05]: How could you not know about it?

390
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:21,534
[SPEAKER_05]: You can drink so much water that it kills you.

391
00:30:21,574 --> 00:30:23,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're pretty much saturating.

392
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:28,879
[SPEAKER_03]: But being a radio contest, I thought they would have taken the precautions to warn the contestants and stuff.

393
00:30:29,643 --> 00:30:31,587
[SPEAKER_03]: or at least have somebody on hand.

394
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:35,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying at all that the DJs in the station were not at fault.

395
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:37,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying that there's equal fault.

396
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:44,576
[SPEAKER_05]: And, I mean, maybe everybody doesn't know that you can, you know, drink yourself of water to death.

397
00:30:44,696 --> 00:30:45,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was common sense.

398
00:30:46,256 --> 00:30:47,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting perspective in the chat room.

399
00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:51,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike W. says, DarkSakura, it's not the DJ's fault for doing what his boss told him.

400
00:30:51,577 --> 00:30:54,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree to an extent, and that's why ten people were fired over this.

401
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:57,759
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's why, you know, certainly a lot of people, not just the DJs, were fired.

402
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:05,400
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm telling you, if you listen to the audio, which is available on one of our local newspapers, SACB.com has audio of the whole thing.

403
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,741
[SPEAKER_02]: My whole point is that anything that's going to affect the body, you really, really need to understand what the risks are before you decide to do it.

404
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:35,791
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my point.

405
00:31:36,651 --> 00:31:40,012
[SPEAKER_05]: And it came out more harshly than I intended it to.

406
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:48,433
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, and I'm not saying anyone deserves to die, but I'm saying that if you die of your own ignorance, then that is on you.

407
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:48,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

408
00:31:49,453 --> 00:31:55,314
[SPEAKER_05]: But they did have, and I think that they should have been more than fired.

409
00:31:55,354 --> 00:31:57,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they really need to stand trial for it.

410
00:31:57,695 --> 00:32:04,516
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that those that were in charge of the contest, they had a duty to make sure that the risks were put out there.

411
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:09,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess for the people who don't have common knowledge of this.

412
00:32:10,014 --> 00:32:10,274
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

413
00:32:10,314 --> 00:32:12,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we could talk for hours and hours about this.

414
00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:13,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, we did on Wednesday's show.

415
00:32:13,457 --> 00:32:14,998
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked for at least an hour about this.

416
00:32:15,078 --> 00:32:18,401
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the interest of getting to more news, I'm directly involved with gaming.

417
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:19,301
[SPEAKER_02]: We do want to move on.

418
00:32:19,702 --> 00:32:22,644
[SPEAKER_02]: We do welcome your emails and voicemails on this topic.

419
00:32:22,684 --> 00:32:27,468
[SPEAKER_02]: But please keep in mind, since this is a controversial issue, we're probably not going to get to read everything we get on it.

420
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:29,129
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do welcome your thoughts.

421
00:32:29,249 --> 00:32:32,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLaundry.com or our voicemail, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

422
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:39,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on and talk about some news that is definitely directly about gaming.

423
00:32:39,617 --> 00:32:40,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's got something for us?

424
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:41,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

425
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:43,640
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about some dates here.

426
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:49,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a lot piling up actually the last two weeks and even some stuff we announced on the site a little bit.

427
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:52,125
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet no one seems to be picking up on that.

428
00:32:52,686 --> 00:32:57,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of stuff being announced this week, especially on all the big sites.

429
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:00,771
[SPEAKER_01]: They were announcing a crazy taxi for the PSP.

430
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:02,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a big surprise.

431
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:03,413
[SPEAKER_01]: That's coming June 13th.

432
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:17,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Some other stuff, Two Worlds, the PS3 version I guess is being delayed to October 10th and then the Xbox 360 one will be coming out in May on the 16th.

433
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:19,819
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's some stuff that we probably already knew about.

434
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,482
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are a lot of things that many people haven't heard about yet and some stuff that's a little bit surprising.

435
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:29,464
[SPEAKER_01]: First off here, we've got...

436
00:33:30,393 --> 00:33:35,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, a bunch of no-brainer titles, like a new bunch of movie-based stuff.

437
00:33:36,956 --> 00:33:47,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Ratatouille for pretty much every system out there except for the original Xbox to tie in with the upcoming Pixar movie.

438
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:55,004
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, we've got Surf's Up also tying with the new movie coming out, and that's coming out in May.

439
00:33:56,205 --> 00:33:56,965
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting, though,

440
00:33:57,912 --> 00:34:03,615
[SPEAKER_01]: and beyond all that stuff, and like Spider-Man 3 and Transformers and Shrek the Third.

441
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,197
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some interesting stuff like Dog Island.

442
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:12,319
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you remember when they were first showing off the Wii stuff in Japan.

443
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:23,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was a Hudson game, but it's basically that character, the dog, where they have the giant heads, kind of almost like, I don't know, some sort of toy thing over there.

444
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:28,690
[SPEAKER_01]: That's coming out on the PlayStation 2 and the Wii May 23rd, which is kind of interesting.

445
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Some bigger stuff, though.

446
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy Fables, Chocobo Tales.

447
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:36,372
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be coming out on the DS April 25th.

448
00:34:36,772 --> 00:34:39,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Dawn of Mana, finally making its way out to the PlayStation 2.

449
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,633
[SPEAKER_01]: That's May 15th.

450
00:34:43,153 --> 00:34:48,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, Guitar Hero 2 for the 360 is going to be coming out at the end of March on the 28th.

451
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:50,475
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty big.

452
00:34:51,408 --> 00:35:12,790
[SPEAKER_01]: and then, um, some other interesting stuff, MotorStorm, MLB07 The Show, and God of War 2 have all been delayed a month, um, to March 14th now, so that's kind of interesting, uh, same with Fear also got delayed to that time, and then, of course, the big one that we announced on the site, uh, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic has been announced for the Xbox 360, and, um,

453
00:35:15,936 --> 00:35:23,358
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that was something that was being rumored to have happened ever since, actually before the 360 even came out, so it's kind of interesting there.

454
00:35:25,478 --> 00:35:36,601
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see, and then, you know, other interesting stuff, Samurai Slash, which would be Samurai Warriors, the Koei game, coming to the Wii, and that's going to be May 16th.

455
00:35:37,521 --> 00:35:41,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Fatal Inertia, Bladestorm, also coming out on the 360 and the PlayStation 3, April 18th.

456
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:51,688
[SPEAKER_01]: which, you know, Koei actually came out and officially said summer, but April 18th is more accurate.

457
00:35:52,088 --> 00:35:52,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Kane and Lynch.

458
00:35:52,929 --> 00:36:00,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this one I'm kind of, you know, shaking my head with because I thought it was PlayStation 3 and the 360, but we have an announcement for PlayStation 2 and the 360.

459
00:36:00,735 --> 00:36:04,117
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, but that's interesting.

460
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:06,099
[SPEAKER_01]: June 20th for that one.

461
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,683
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's probably all the big stuff I'd say.

462
00:36:12,284 --> 00:36:13,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Just lots of dates.

463
00:36:13,024 --> 00:36:17,465
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't post more in that Under the Radar thread, though, if you want to check out the details there.

464
00:36:17,485 --> 00:36:19,325
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be posting some of that to the front page, really.

465
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:22,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not heard of God of War being pushed back.

466
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:23,106
[SPEAKER_02]: That's news to me.

467
00:36:23,426 --> 00:36:25,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I haven't been following for that story very closely.

468
00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:26,707
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's kind of cool, too.

469
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:28,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Senko no Rondo for the 360.

470
00:36:28,567 --> 00:36:34,568
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an Ikaruga-style shooter that's coming out on May 16th as well.

471
00:36:36,048 --> 00:36:37,709
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, lots of big stuff.

472
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:39,149
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

473
00:36:39,892 --> 00:36:40,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for the insight.

474
00:36:40,813 --> 00:36:42,814
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some, what's coming out next week?

475
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:43,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not much.

476
00:36:44,056 --> 00:36:45,557
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I figured as much.

477
00:36:45,897 --> 00:36:47,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much of anything, actually.

478
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Next week is a bunch of portable games, and that's pretty much it.

479
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:53,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.

480
00:36:54,024 --> 00:36:58,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've got the, was it Hotel 219?

481
00:36:58,848 --> 00:36:58,127
213.

482
00:36:58,868 --> 00:37:01,230
[SPEAKER_01]: 213, my mistake.

483
00:37:02,231 --> 00:37:04,473
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be coming out on the DS.

484
00:37:05,194 --> 00:37:08,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Megalotov, you've been talking to me about this game a lot today.

485
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:09,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you so excited about it?

486
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:15,439
[SPEAKER_03]: It's by the people that do Trace Memory, and I love Trace Memory for the two hours that you get to play it for.

487
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,882
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like a film noir looking... Oh, it's 2.15.

488
00:37:21,582 --> 00:37:27,745
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like a film noir thing where you're like some detective guy, and you hold your DS book style.

489
00:37:28,086 --> 00:37:28,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Like brain training?

490
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:31,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's just an adventure game.

491
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:32,048
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

492
00:37:32,328 --> 00:37:32,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

493
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:48,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Other stuff on the PSP, Legend of Heroes 3, Song of the Ocean, which is another addition in the RPG series Inuyasha, Secret of the Divine Jewel on the DS, Sid Meier's Pirates on the PSP Pirates!

494
00:37:48,954 --> 00:37:55,540
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some PC stuff, of course we've got Europa Universals 3, another strategy game

495
00:37:56,301 --> 00:38:03,343
[SPEAKER_01]: and Alien Shooter Vengeance on the PC and then Salmon Max Episode 3, The Mole, The Mob and The Meatball.

496
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:06,024
[SPEAKER_01]: More episodic content for you.

497
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:07,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

498
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:12,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have our UK release dates if anybody is interested.

501
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:58,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of UK, you know our opening story, the controversial one this evening.

502
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:00,312
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how I knew that was big news?

503
00:39:00,732 --> 00:39:02,153
[SPEAKER_02]: When I saw it on BBC News.

504
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:04,055
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I was like, wow.

505
00:39:05,396 --> 00:39:12,620
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't know about the don't drink water and don't go to the bathroom thing before, you sure as hell will now.

506
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody in the world will know it.

507
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:14,802
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something else.

508
00:39:15,442 --> 00:39:16,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Common sense, people.

509
00:39:17,096 --> 00:39:17,656
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

510
00:39:36,011 --> 00:39:40,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Such as The Godfather, which is now making its way over to Japan on Xbox 360 on January 25th.

511
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:47,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Also coming out The Idolmaster on 360 and Vampire's Reign from AQ Interactive.

519
00:41:48,112 --> 00:41:49,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that just the hotel game localized over there?

520
00:41:49,973 --> 00:41:51,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.

521
00:41:51,194 --> 00:41:52,095
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is pretty cool.

522
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:53,396
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you'll like this.

523
00:41:53,456 --> 00:41:56,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out on the PSP, Parodius Portable.

524
00:41:56,946 --> 00:41:58,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Make this way to the PSP.

525
00:41:58,346 --> 00:42:00,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're a big fan of Parodius.

526
00:42:00,607 --> 00:42:02,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that the Parodius collection or something?

527
00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:03,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it is.

528
00:42:03,528 --> 00:42:06,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Parodius.

529
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:08,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the Salamander collection.

530
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:10,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Salamander Portable is coming out this week as well.

531
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,511
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just talking about Salamander and Life Force this morning.

532
00:42:13,591 --> 00:42:17,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gradius moves into the best, so a big week if you're a Gradius fan over in Japan.

533
00:42:17,592 --> 00:42:19,792
[SPEAKER_02]: So while it may be a slow week here in the U.S.

534
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:22,773
[SPEAKER_02]: and U.K., it's a busy week over there in Japan.

535
00:42:22,893 --> 00:42:26,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to mention, though, this week they did announce

536
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,392
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

537
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow Charlie seems to enjoy Parodius as well.

538
00:42:51,353 --> 00:42:54,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Parodius has some badass music, says Shadow Charlie.

539
00:42:55,254 --> 00:42:58,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shadow Charlie also wants to know, is DDR Universe out yet?

540
00:42:58,335 --> 00:42:59,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is no.

541
00:42:59,855 --> 00:43:03,596
[SPEAKER_02]: So those that were thinking it's coming out in January, looks like it really was March.

542
00:43:03,696 --> 00:43:05,816
[SPEAKER_02]: After all, Loki wins again.

543
00:43:07,677 --> 00:43:12,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have a little bit more on use as far as things that are going to be playable this year.

544
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,549
[SPEAKER_05]: The Final Fantasy XIII demo is due out.

545
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:18,151
[SPEAKER_05]: They said ready for E3 in 2007.

546
00:43:21,513 --> 00:43:30,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure which one I guess they mean, because given that there's multiple Final Fantasy XIII going on, two of them going on with Squeenix.

547
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:36,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if they mean both or just one or the other of them.

548
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:38,650
[SPEAKER_01]: They should do 13 versions of that.

549
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:40,210
[SPEAKER_01]: That would make sense.

550
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:42,251
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably will, eventually.

551
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:43,191
[SPEAKER_05]: That would make me cry.

552
00:43:44,272 --> 00:43:47,153
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already got, what, 13 versions of Final Fantasy VII, practically.

553
00:43:47,373 --> 00:43:48,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even feel like counting.

554
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:53,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Or 13 versions of Final Fantasy I, as we're going to find out later in the program.

555
00:43:54,596 --> 00:44:00,558
[SPEAKER_05]: But at any rate, the two are going to... I love Latin.

556
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Fabula Nova Crystallis.

557
00:44:02,138 --> 00:44:03,059
[SPEAKER_05]: That just sounds cool.

558
00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:05,040
[SPEAKER_05]: The new Tale of the Crystal.

559
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool.

560
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:14,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of interesting, especially when folks are saying that the PlayStation 3 really needs its big title right now.

561
00:44:14,106 --> 00:44:18,711
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of interesting how this Final Fantasy XIII news is kind of slowly leaking out, right?

562
00:44:19,392 --> 00:44:20,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what they need?

563
00:44:20,513 --> 00:44:22,856
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like Final Fantasy VII for the PlayStation.

564
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:24,617
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hell, I bought that system for that game.

565
00:44:24,637 --> 00:44:25,058
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

566
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:27,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not buy a PlayStation until Final Fantasy VII.

567
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:27,981
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

568
00:44:28,301 --> 00:44:28,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit.

569
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:39,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIII, especially depending on this demo, you know, after I play the demo, will probably be the thing that finally breaks me to get a PlayStation 3, because I'm the only OLR host that doesn't own one.

570
00:44:40,924 --> 00:44:41,564
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm poor.

571
00:44:42,384 --> 00:44:45,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so more on Final Fantasy XIII.

572
00:44:45,745 --> 00:44:48,206
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been leaked out by Famitsu and Dengeki.

573
00:44:49,307 --> 00:44:57,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Some stuff they're talking about, I guess, from the playable demo, including apparently it's going to have a really awesome opening scene.

574
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:58,430
[SPEAKER_01]: It says probably the most...

575
00:44:59,855 --> 00:45:01,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that means his penis is going to be huge too.

576
00:45:28,743 --> 00:45:29,223
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever.

577
00:45:29,744 --> 00:45:35,388
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully we'll get some more important information on Final Fantasy XIII coming soon.

578
00:45:35,828 --> 00:45:36,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than shoe sizes.

579
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,031
[SPEAKER_01]: We need bus sizes.

580
00:45:39,071 --> 00:45:39,651
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we need.

581
00:45:40,392 --> 00:45:41,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's that information?

582
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:45,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm definitely looking forward to more and more information on Final Fantasy XIII.

583
00:45:45,636 --> 00:45:52,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Being the self-confessed Final Fantasy fanboy I am, I'm personally very excited for all the latest.

584
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:54,282
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see hopefully more in the next few weeks.

585
00:45:55,905 --> 00:45:58,526
[SPEAKER_02]: More things that Japan is seeing is apparently PlayStation 3.

586
00:45:58,946 --> 00:46:03,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony put out a release this week that says they have sold one million of the machines.

587
00:46:03,788 --> 00:46:04,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

588
00:46:04,569 --> 00:46:04,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

589
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:05,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait.

590
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:05,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Key difference here.

591
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:08,911
[SPEAKER_02]: They have shipped one million machines in Japan.

592
00:46:09,111 --> 00:46:10,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry there.

593
00:46:10,411 --> 00:46:11,872
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I almost fell for the trick there.

594
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:14,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so tired of these fucking companies doing this shit.

595
00:46:14,754 --> 00:46:15,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we've shipped them.

596
00:46:16,094 --> 00:46:16,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for you.

597
00:46:16,855 --> 00:46:18,095
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken a shit, too.

598
00:46:18,155 --> 00:46:19,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do you want news on that, too?

599
00:46:20,076 --> 00:46:21,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously, I can...

600
00:46:22,466 --> 00:46:23,786
[SPEAKER_01]: So you shipped that many.

601
00:46:23,807 --> 00:46:27,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't they say they've manufactured that many or thought about manufacturing that many?

602
00:46:27,948 --> 00:46:33,970
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be interesting to note that Sony only actually sold about 470,000 at the end of 2006.

603
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,251
[SPEAKER_02]: That was their year's end sale figure.

604
00:46:36,311 --> 00:46:38,912
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of interesting that this release comes out now.

605
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:40,772
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, oh, we've actually shipped a million.

606
00:46:41,152 --> 00:46:42,573
[SPEAKER_02]: So does that mean that half of them are shitting?

607
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:43,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Shitting?

608
00:46:44,153 --> 00:46:45,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting on shelves?

609
00:46:45,754 --> 00:46:47,155
[SPEAKER_02]: They're shitting on the seashore.

610
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:48,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got like...

611
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:51,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I got dyslexia of the mouth today.

612
00:46:51,084 --> 00:46:51,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

613
00:46:51,624 --> 00:46:53,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm combining words that don't need to be combined.

614
00:46:53,786 --> 00:46:54,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what's wrong today.

615
00:46:54,926 --> 00:46:55,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize, folks.

616
00:46:56,908 --> 00:46:58,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Amateur radio at its finest.

617
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this is why we don't get paid to do what we do.

618
00:47:03,493 --> 00:47:14,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Should you have half a million of them sitting on the store shelves, or have they moved a whole bunch in the last two weeks that they've now shipped more to compensate for that?

619
00:47:14,561 --> 00:47:15,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know.

620
00:47:15,422 --> 00:47:18,404
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to understand, they've shipped more units to the stores.

621
00:47:19,454 --> 00:47:31,996
[SPEAKER_01]: to allow for more elaborate towers to be made out of the units that no one's buying, including castles and the traditional Christmas tree tower type thing.

622
00:47:32,546 --> 00:47:45,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, it should be noted that now they have achieved their goal of shipping 2 million units worldwide about two weeks late from the deadline, but keep in mind that was a goal that got smaller and smaller before the PS3's release.

623
00:47:45,356 --> 00:47:47,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't their goal to sell that many units?

624
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:47,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

625
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:51,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're saying 6 million at the end of March they will ship.

626
00:47:53,543 --> 00:47:59,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to see that they were able to hit their twice-adjusted goal two weeks late.

627
00:48:00,028 --> 00:48:00,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Way to go, Sony.

628
00:48:01,569 --> 00:48:01,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I

629
00:48:02,236 --> 00:48:04,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, look, I don't write it, I just report on it.

630
00:48:04,158 --> 00:48:04,618
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

631
00:48:05,459 --> 00:48:06,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what else to tell you.

632
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what else to tell people.

633
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:08,781
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

634
00:48:09,502 --> 00:48:16,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, it's been listed that the PlayStation 3 is going to be more expensive in Ireland, and I don't know why.

635
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:27,217
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually listed on This Is Living that the price of the PlayStation 3 in Ireland is going to be...

636
00:48:28,315 --> 00:48:32,958
[SPEAKER_05]: 629.99 euros instead of the announced 5.99.

637
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:50,448
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually, the speculation is that it actually is going to be an increase all over Europe, but just that Ireland got the update first, so I really hope that it's

638
00:48:51,448 --> 00:48:55,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Not true, you know, that they keep it the $5.99 because that's going to piss off a lot of people.

639
00:48:56,154 --> 00:49:00,058
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard it was because the higher VAT prices in Ireland.

640
00:49:00,419 --> 00:49:06,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Seisha is one of our UK listeners, and he's in chat right now saying it's not just Ireland, but the entirety of the UK as well.

641
00:49:07,366 --> 00:49:07,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

642
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Has Sony released?

643
00:49:09,552 --> 00:49:15,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we read that to be that it was just Ireland, but maybe something's changed since that published.

644
00:49:16,535 --> 00:49:18,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if all their VAT prices went up, I don't know.

645
00:49:18,396 --> 00:49:20,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, has Sony even officially confirmed anything?

646
00:49:20,577 --> 00:49:24,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we still don't have a firm date for the UK, do we?

647
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:26,520
[SPEAKER_01]: They've confirmed non-confirmation.

648
00:49:27,621 --> 00:49:31,002
[SPEAKER_02]: So does this mean we don't really know anything, or what's it boiled down to?

649
00:49:31,683 --> 00:49:33,784
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that their shipping units...

650
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Some day, some amount.

651
00:49:37,939 --> 00:49:45,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, there is an update, a posted update, that that's exactly why it did increase.

652
00:49:45,681 --> 00:49:55,443
[SPEAKER_05]: For the rest of everybody else, it's going to be $5.99 for the $60 and $4.25 for the... Damn you, Ireland, setting the bar for everyone else.

653
00:49:56,363 --> 00:49:57,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Just buy the $20.

654
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:57,964
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't need the $60.

655
00:49:58,644 --> 00:49:58,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

656
00:49:58,924 --> 00:49:59,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the $60.

657
00:49:59,924 --> 00:50:01,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it, but I use my HDMI.

658
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,241
[SPEAKER_02]: So is HDMI that important?

659
00:50:05,261 --> 00:50:05,761
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

660
00:50:06,081 --> 00:50:07,022
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on both units.

661
00:50:07,822 --> 00:50:10,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was a big thing that it wasn't going to be on the 20 gig.

662
00:50:10,263 --> 00:50:11,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, then they changed that.

663
00:50:11,604 --> 00:50:11,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

664
00:50:12,024 --> 00:50:13,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's on both units.

665
00:50:13,064 --> 00:50:13,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get that memo.

666
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:15,045
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still stupid.

667
00:50:15,065 --> 00:50:16,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the 60 and I like it.

668
00:50:16,586 --> 00:50:16,886
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

669
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:17,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

670
00:50:18,286 --> 00:50:19,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm running out of room on the 360 with the 20 gig.

671
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:20,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can always upgrade.

672
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:20,888
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

673
00:50:24,699 --> 00:50:29,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, those hard drives, the 2.5 inch SATA drives are fucking expensive, but whatever.

674
00:50:29,882 --> 00:50:31,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't made a decision on what I want to do yet.

675
00:50:31,483 --> 00:50:32,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too poor, I know that much.

676
00:50:32,523 --> 00:50:40,067
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, one reason you might want to upgrade that 2.5 inch SATA drive in your PS3 is to run Myth TV on it.

677
00:50:40,547 --> 00:50:49,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you install the second operating system or Linux on your other partition, there is actually a way now to get Myth TV to run.

678
00:50:49,912 --> 00:50:51,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Using a USB TV tuner,

679
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:56,003
[SPEAKER_01]: and a wonderful set of homemade drivers for it.

680
00:50:56,824 --> 00:51:06,047
[SPEAKER_01]: You too can run the wonderful TVR software to be able to record your favorite shows and dump them onto your hopefully larger hard drive.

681
00:51:06,968 --> 00:51:07,708
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty cool.

682
00:51:09,249 --> 00:51:11,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.

683
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:17,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I might try that since I don't really have room on my other drive, although I need to get a capture card for that.

684
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:19,573
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, that's great.

685
00:51:20,558 --> 00:51:26,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, from one TV-enabled system to another, let's go over to Microsoft IPTV.

686
00:51:26,322 --> 00:51:30,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, this was announced at CES, and details are starting to fill in.

687
00:51:30,865 --> 00:51:35,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lengthy quote here from the Microsoft TV site of what exactly this thing does.

688
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:47,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, Microsoft TV IPTV Edition is an integrated and comprehensive software platform developed specifically to deliver broadcast quality video and new integrated TV services over broadband networks.

689
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:47,857
[SPEAKER_02]: and many more.

690
00:52:13,158 --> 00:52:18,006
[SPEAKER_02]: and for cable operators looking to deliver differentiated TV services and experiences.

691
00:52:25,126 --> 00:52:29,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Download it or just plug on to your Xbox 360 and boom, you get TV through your 360.

692
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:30,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, no, no, no.

693
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:37,555
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to switch up your cable provider who therefore will also provide your internet and so on and so on.

694
00:52:37,635 --> 00:52:45,842
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really going to have to make an adjustment change when it comes to how your services such as internet and TV are provided in your house.

695
00:52:46,642 --> 00:52:52,386
[SPEAKER_02]: If people are thinking, oh, this is just some cool little enhancement of 360, it's a little more than that.

696
00:52:53,327 --> 00:52:54,408
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of makes me think like

697
00:52:55,886 --> 00:53:00,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost like Microsoft is now becoming a rival to Satellite in a way.

698
00:53:00,668 --> 00:53:00,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

699
00:53:01,028 --> 00:53:02,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's a little bit far-fetched.

700
00:53:02,148 --> 00:53:04,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the best way to phrase it, but I don't know.

701
00:53:04,229 --> 00:53:04,830
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

702
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:07,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something you might be interested in checking out?

703
00:53:07,571 --> 00:53:08,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I would check it out, definitely.

704
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:09,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you make that change?

705
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you get rid of what you have now for this?

706
00:53:11,832 --> 00:53:12,372
[SPEAKER_01]: What I have?

707
00:53:12,392 --> 00:53:14,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because cable's fucking too expensive.

708
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:17,654
[SPEAKER_01]: If it had some good programming on it, hell yeah.

709
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:22,096
[SPEAKER_01]: If it had everything, although I imagine IPTV doesn't probably have everything.

710
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:24,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it might have some specific channels, you know.

711
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

712
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:33,643
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, it would be a good addition to, if not, replacing my current TV.

713
00:53:34,183 --> 00:53:36,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Although my current TV is expensive, and I hate it.

714
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:40,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at some comments from chatroom, chat.orangelunchradio.com.

715
00:53:41,185 --> 00:53:44,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackboy says, basically the 360 becomes a cable box.

716
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's kind of one way you can think of it.

717
00:53:46,247 --> 00:53:47,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a waste.

718
00:53:49,078 --> 00:53:57,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, again, this is Microsoft doing the Trojan horse thing, and they've openly admitted that they did not put out the 360 to do just gaming.

719
00:53:57,745 --> 00:54:03,170
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and now it's down to, you know, it sounds to me like cable versus satellite versus the 360.

720
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:06,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can do what I do, and that's not watch TV and get a life.

721
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:11,071
[SPEAKER_02]: But even there, you watch Doctor Who, you watch something.

722
00:54:11,091 --> 00:54:14,934
[SPEAKER_05]: I download it off the internet, watch it at my convenience, and then go outside.

723
00:54:15,034 --> 00:54:17,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is some television you watch, at least one thing.

724
00:54:17,396 --> 00:54:18,577
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't use my television anymore.

725
00:54:18,597 --> 00:54:19,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And Torchwood, you watch that too.

726
00:54:19,558 --> 00:54:20,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need cable.

727
00:54:21,259 --> 00:54:27,584
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could, with the IPTV, you could set it, now granted you don't live in the UK, if there were any US shows that you watched, I mean I know they rebroadcast.

728
00:54:27,604 --> 00:54:28,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Heroes starts tomorrow.

729
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:32,108
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing at all worth watching on television in the United States.

730
00:54:32,128 --> 00:54:33,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to watch Heroes tomorrow with Doctor Nine?

731
00:54:35,091 --> 00:54:36,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not actually, I'm going to be in school.

732
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,361
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

733
00:55:05,999 --> 00:55:06,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

734
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:06,859
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

735
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:16,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if I got anything for TV, I'd definitely have a DVR, but other than that... Yeah, and then that's kind of what IPTV is, you know, DVR, video on demand, all that crap.

736
00:55:16,502 --> 00:55:22,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just don't think that... I don't think that we need anything else contributing to the couch potato mentality.

737
00:55:22,243 --> 00:55:24,484
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are... And there's educational things on TV.

738
00:55:24,504 --> 00:55:31,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck, over at Loki's last night, we were watching on Discovery Health this whole special on people going through transgender surgery, and there was this post-op chick...

739
00:55:32,432 --> 00:55:33,932
[SPEAKER_02]: JV Mon in chat says, IPTV seems unattractive to me.

740
00:55:33,952 --> 00:55:35,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I don't know enough about it yet.

741
00:55:35,773 --> 00:55:35,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Like,

742
00:55:54,964 --> 00:55:59,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize CES is kind of a very high-level thing for tech heads and things of that nature.

743
00:55:59,168 --> 00:56:07,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a brochure that's dumbed down for me to explain exactly what I'm going to have to change and what I'm going to have to pay to get this and why I should do it.

744
00:56:07,495 --> 00:56:09,457
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, for me, it comes down to the channels.

745
00:56:09,677 --> 00:56:17,944
[SPEAKER_02]: If it had some pretty good HD channels, because that's what my current cable provider is severely lacking, is we have like five HD channels, and there's way more out there.

746
00:56:18,365 --> 00:56:21,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's others out there, and HD is pretty good.

747
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:23,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Raven's Dolphin agrees with the YouTube thing.

748
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:24,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Long live YouTube.

749
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:26,352
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

750
00:56:29,093 --> 00:56:29,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on.

751
00:56:31,675 --> 00:56:36,777
[SPEAKER_01]: We watched YouTube last night on the Wii.

752
00:56:38,118 --> 00:56:38,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Laser Cats.

753
00:56:39,659 --> 00:56:42,801
[SPEAKER_05]: We were watching Jesus Christ Supercop today on the Wii.

754
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:44,782
[SPEAKER_02]: They were watching some...

755
00:56:45,801 --> 00:56:46,362
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

756
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:14,984
[SPEAKER_05]: The assault rifle in Halo 3 is the MA-5C assault rifle that is a return of one that they removed from Halo 2.

757
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:15,924
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't have in Halo 2.

758
00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:22,826
[SPEAKER_05]: The power level is going to be somewhere between the original one and the BR-55 battle rifle from Halo 2.

759
00:57:23,927 --> 00:57:26,788
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use the butt as a melee weapon apart from that.

760
00:57:27,268 --> 00:57:34,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a thing that I thought was very funny is how they described it was the MA-5C is built like a brick outhouse with Venetian blinds.

761
00:57:35,168 --> 00:57:36,028
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

762
00:58:05,157 --> 00:58:09,959
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I remembered there are those cutesy games that you are into that none of the rest of us have freaking heard of.

763
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:11,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess there's that.

764
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:16,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Halo really isn't, you know, the Halo franchise really isn't that bad.

765
00:58:17,242 --> 00:58:20,763
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that it's not my thing, you know.

766
00:58:21,503 --> 00:58:25,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's understandable because certainly I know a lot of people who aren't into Halo, which is another thing.

767
00:58:25,565 --> 00:58:27,606
[SPEAKER_02]: But me, I've been getting back into Halo too lately.

768
00:58:27,646 --> 00:58:28,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I did try.

769
00:58:29,747 --> 00:58:32,928
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if somebody I know is into a game...

770
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it's worth playing once before I reserve my judgment for it.

771
00:58:37,831 --> 00:58:49,934
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have the same problem with that that I found out a long time ago that I have with Goldeneye, with almost any first-person shooter, that it makes me so motion sick that I can't... Katamari makes me motion sick.

772
00:58:50,334 --> 00:58:55,415
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it's on crack and has enough in it that makes me be able to stand playing a couple of games.

773
00:58:55,435 --> 00:58:56,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

774
00:58:57,216 --> 00:58:57,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

775
00:58:57,856 --> 00:59:02,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine how insane Katamari would be if the Sonic team was behind it?

776
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,581
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be like super fast.

777
00:59:05,661 --> 00:59:06,941
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because they'd fuck it up.

778
00:59:07,101 --> 00:59:09,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right, you wouldn't be able to control it correctly.

779
00:59:09,283 --> 00:59:10,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

780
00:59:10,123 --> 00:59:11,184
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no.

781
00:59:11,784 --> 00:59:14,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that Sonic Team needs to, never mind.

782
00:59:14,205 --> 00:59:16,366
[SPEAKER_05]: The Sonic Team debate will go for another show.

783
00:59:17,227 --> 00:59:31,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywho, as if it's a huge surprise or anything, because I know it's not for me, the Halo 3 beta, since it's being included in Crackdown, well, they've sold about another 25% more of Crackdown than they would have normally had.

784
00:59:31,653 --> 00:59:33,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, big surprise there.

785
00:59:33,334 --> 00:59:36,717
[SPEAKER_01]: People aren't going to buy Crackdown just because of the Halo 3 beta in there.

786
00:59:37,698 --> 00:59:39,499
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, though, Crackdown's an awesome game.

787
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:41,020
[SPEAKER_01]: The demo's coming out on Tuesday.

788
00:59:41,561 --> 00:59:44,023
[SPEAKER_01]: So I highly recommend checking it out if you have Xbox Live.

789
00:59:44,763 --> 00:59:45,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely worth it.

790
00:59:48,786 --> 00:59:56,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as Loki previously reported, Major Nelson confirmed that Crackdown demo will be hitting Xbox Live on Tuesday.

791
00:59:56,412 --> 00:59:56,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

792
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:59,195
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki gets a big finger from me for stealing my story.

793
00:59:59,235 --> 00:59:59,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot.

794
01:00:00,273 --> 01:00:02,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out, Tuesday at 2 o'clock Pacific Time.

795
01:00:03,055 --> 01:00:07,780
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess I could take this opportunity to point out, he doesn't often announce demos in advance.

796
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:14,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually they announce them once they've already hit, or news leaks out, and most Microsoft rumors are true anyway.

797
01:00:15,246 --> 01:00:16,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

798
01:00:17,288 --> 01:00:24,454
[SPEAKER_02]: But regardless, since I don't know much about Crackdown, but I keep hearing Loki rave about it, which is fascinating because he's never played it, I definitely want to check out the demo.

799
01:00:24,474 --> 01:00:27,597
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Grand Theft Auto, but here's why Crackdown's awesome.

800
01:00:28,442 --> 01:00:29,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you sleep with a hooker then shoot them?

801
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,166
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can sleep with hookers.

802
01:00:53,266 --> 01:00:53,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Not interested.

803
01:00:54,247 --> 01:00:57,129
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can probably throw hookers into buildings and that's just as cool.

804
01:00:57,369 --> 01:00:58,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now my interest is back.

805
01:00:58,850 --> 01:00:59,130
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

806
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:02,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got two-player co-op over live.

807
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:03,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, alright.

808
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:04,574
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that would be fun.

809
01:01:04,714 --> 01:01:08,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I will check out the demo just for you, Loki, and give my thoughts on next week's edition.

810
01:01:08,317 --> 01:01:08,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got multiplayer co-op.

811
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:09,858
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll play multiplayer.

812
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:12,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, will the demo have multiplayer?

813
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:12,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

814
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:13,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sweet.

815
01:01:14,362 --> 01:01:15,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about that.

816
01:01:15,102 --> 01:01:16,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I throw you into a building?

817
01:01:16,243 --> 01:01:17,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've been wanting to do that for a long time.

818
01:01:17,824 --> 01:01:18,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

819
01:01:18,305 --> 01:01:18,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

820
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:19,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Sign me up.

821
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:21,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I should pre-order it tomorrow.

822
01:01:22,008 --> 01:01:24,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I can be in the Halo 3 beta like all the cool kids.

823
01:01:26,152 --> 01:01:29,074
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be in the cool kids club for lots of other things, Rob.

824
01:01:29,835 --> 01:01:30,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what?

825
01:01:31,456 --> 01:01:37,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Like your idea for getting fast passes while we were in the line for Space Mountain.

826
01:01:37,322 --> 01:01:38,202
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could ride it again?

827
01:01:38,222 --> 01:01:39,023
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could ride it again.

828
01:01:39,343 --> 01:01:41,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And then getting fast passes for when we go back for my birthday.

829
01:01:42,386 --> 01:01:42,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smart.

830
01:01:43,067 --> 01:01:43,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smart like that.

831
01:01:44,148 --> 01:01:46,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's some cool stuff.

832
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:56,695
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who is into Luminous Live, there will be three goodies coming out on Wednesday.

833
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:05,918
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually three downloadable packages that are going to be available January 24th at 1 a.m.

834
01:02:05,978 --> 01:02:07,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Pacific time.

835
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:15,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of them are add-on packs, and then there's one for free, but only for Xbox Live Gold members.

836
01:02:16,087 --> 01:02:17,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it would be the Heavenly Star Pack.

837
01:02:17,807 --> 01:02:24,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, which I am so... You know, I would get Luminous Live just to get the Heavenly Star Pack.

838
01:02:24,489 --> 01:02:32,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and this gives me another excuse to play this song on our little program here, a little clip from it, because I freaking love this song, and I think it's going to be awesome to play.

839
01:02:32,272 --> 01:02:33,512
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your fault I put it on my mic, Dave.

840
01:02:44,204 --> 01:02:49,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, somebody in chat is saying there's new Alpha Canogram says I want the new Genki Rockets remixes on iTunes.

841
01:02:49,488 --> 01:02:49,688
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

842
01:02:49,748 --> 01:02:49,948
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

843
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:51,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I have iTunes open right now.

844
01:02:51,229 --> 01:02:52,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to look at that crap.

845
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:53,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, show.

846
01:02:54,131 --> 01:02:55,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not see remixes on iTunes.

847
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:56,853
[SPEAKER_02]: This is lies.

848
01:02:57,474 --> 01:02:57,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Lies.

849
01:02:58,154 --> 01:02:59,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're in the UK store or something.

850
01:02:59,495 --> 01:02:59,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

851
01:03:00,776 --> 01:03:01,076
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

852
01:03:01,316 --> 01:03:01,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

853
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:01,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Show.

854
01:03:02,517 --> 01:03:04,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I did want to go back and read some chat comments, some other things in chat.

855
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:15,040
[SPEAKER_02]: JeremyTodd1 was saying about the Crackdown demo, Loki, some people who have played it were saying it's more like Spider-Man 2 or that Hulk Ultimate Destruction game more than GTA.

856
01:03:16,142 --> 01:03:16,302
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

857
01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:19,050
[SPEAKER_02]: and Blaze says this is how the demo is going to go down.

858
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:20,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki kills everything.

859
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:22,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob goes and picks a flower.

860
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:23,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, screw you, buddy.

861
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:23,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

862
01:03:23,911 --> 01:03:24,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, no.

863
01:03:25,131 --> 01:03:25,271
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

864
01:03:25,671 --> 01:03:35,014
[SPEAKER_02]: When I played the Superman Returns demo, which the only thing I got a thrill out of in that demo was I went and I picked up a woman and then I flew to the beach and left her and I was like, bye, bitch.

865
01:03:35,314 --> 01:03:36,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I flew away.

866
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:40,636
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't think I can be sadistic in those types of games, you are way wrong.

867
01:03:40,656 --> 01:03:42,076
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the wrong impression of me, buddy.

868
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,737
[SPEAKER_01]: You missed the best part in the game, though.

869
01:03:43,757 --> 01:03:48,059
[SPEAKER_01]: You pick up a car, and you fly really high, because you can't really, you know, blow up the car.

870
01:03:48,299 --> 01:03:51,381
[SPEAKER_01]: You could drop the car, though, and it just falls and explodes.

871
01:03:51,921 --> 01:03:52,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

872
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:54,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I should re-download the demo just to do that.

873
01:03:54,422 --> 01:03:55,023
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hilarious.

874
01:03:55,043 --> 01:03:58,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to buy the game, but I'll... Do you get achievements, maybe, for that?

875
01:03:58,725 --> 01:04:00,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Because maybe I could, like, gamefly it.

876
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:02,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get a gamefly account, or one of those companies.

877
01:04:02,787 --> 01:04:03,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'll go with them.

878
01:04:03,467 --> 01:04:04,407
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a horrible, horrible game.

879
01:04:04,447 --> 01:04:07,349
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, one game that's not so horrible, although...

880
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:08,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom Boom Rocket

881
01:04:38,544 --> 01:04:40,185
[SPEAKER_01]: and hopefully it'll be downloadable soon.

882
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:42,505
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

883
01:04:42,585 --> 01:04:45,206
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks pretty cool from the screenshots I've seen of it so far.

884
01:04:46,787 --> 01:04:47,647
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks pretty sexy.

885
01:04:47,847 --> 01:04:48,207
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

886
01:04:49,788 --> 01:04:51,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it just looks like Fantavision.

887
01:04:51,748 --> 01:04:53,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's actual screenshots of it now?

888
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:56,150
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks just like Fantavision and kind of like DDR.

889
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it does look kind of like DDR.

890
01:04:58,610 --> 01:04:59,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jamie can't see.

891
01:04:59,511 --> 01:05:00,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that looks fun.

892
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:01,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Show it to Jamie.

893
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:02,032
[SPEAKER_02]: She can't see.

894
01:05:03,372 --> 01:05:04,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, explodey.

895
01:05:04,872 --> 01:05:06,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Miklatov's excited about this?

896
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:10,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Fantavision, I think I'm the only person in the world who got the biggest kick out of it.

897
01:05:11,004 --> 01:05:11,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have Fantavision.

898
01:05:12,025 --> 01:05:12,725
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best.

899
01:05:12,905 --> 01:05:16,908
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the best launch title, and that looks just like it, and I can't wait now.

900
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:33,418
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does look like DDR, because there's like this kind of a purple line towards the top of the screen, and there's actual, looks like the bursts from the fireworks going up, instead of maybe clicking on them or whatever, they have arrows on them, so I think you have to

901
01:05:34,608 --> 01:05:39,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe point in the direction of the arrow or something, kind of like DDR, and it'll blow them up in time.

902
01:05:40,252 --> 01:05:40,833
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my guess.

903
01:05:41,193 --> 01:05:42,053
[SPEAKER_02]: JV Mon called it.

904
01:05:42,073 --> 01:05:43,835
[SPEAKER_02]: JV Mon said, that will make Miklatov happy.

905
01:05:45,096 --> 01:05:46,777
[SPEAKER_02]: You must talk to him a lot offline or something.

906
01:05:48,098 --> 01:05:48,438
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

907
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:51,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, before we get to the next story, I just want to point this out.

908
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to do a quick follow-up here on the last story.

909
01:05:54,883 --> 01:06:03,589
[SPEAKER_02]: What I thought was interesting is that somebody pointed me to the MySpace for Genkai Rockets, who does Heavenly Star, and apparently it is announced on there that

910
01:06:03,945 --> 01:06:08,450
[SPEAKER_02]: that there will be five different remixes of Heavenly Star coming soon.

911
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:09,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a clip.

912
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming this is one of them.

913
01:06:13,855 --> 01:06:15,436
Tokyo Hot 100.

914
01:06:15,557 --> 01:06:17,038
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is some radio clip.

915
01:06:17,058 --> 01:06:18,139
This is number 27 on 81.3.

916
01:06:18,179 --> 01:06:19,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Genki Rockets, Heavenly Star.

917
01:06:29,188 --> 01:06:29,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, forget it.

918
01:06:29,809 --> 01:06:31,050
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just some clip from the radio.

919
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:32,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Why'd they put that on their MySpace?

920
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:33,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would they put that?

921
01:06:33,371 --> 01:06:34,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Live radio, boys and girls.

922
01:06:34,632 --> 01:06:36,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I didn't know what I was clicking on.

923
01:06:36,514 --> 01:06:40,597
[SPEAKER_02]: They do say on the MySpace, it's written here, five different remixes of Heavenly Star coming soon.

924
01:06:42,338 --> 01:06:42,618
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

925
01:06:42,638 --> 01:06:43,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Why what, Loki?

926
01:06:43,539 --> 01:06:46,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would they put that clip from a radio show?

927
01:06:46,681 --> 01:06:49,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they want to show that Genkai Rockets is awesome.

928
01:06:49,683 --> 01:06:52,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why don't they put an MP3 copy of it or something?

929
01:06:52,145 --> 01:06:55,308
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, something that doesn't sound like recorded off radio.

930
01:06:55,468 --> 01:06:55,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Could...

931
01:06:56,511 --> 01:06:58,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think we could get Genkai Rockets on the show?

932
01:06:58,213 --> 01:06:59,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think they speak English?

933
01:07:01,077 --> 01:07:01,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

934
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:03,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to fire off an email.

935
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to send them a message on MySpace.

936
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:05,942
[SPEAKER_02]: They sing in English.

937
01:07:06,042 --> 01:07:06,523
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.

938
01:07:06,963 --> 01:07:07,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

939
01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:08,565
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

940
01:07:09,286 --> 01:07:09,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway.

941
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:12,599
[SPEAKER_02]: www.darksakura.com

942
01:07:34,935 --> 01:08:01,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero franchise is now moving over to the Neversoft branch who makes Tony Hawk's Project 8 and this is confirmed by a screenshot from Neversoft's website where you see Guitar Hero side by side with Tony Hawk's Project 8 so it does look like now Guitar Hero 3 will be developed by this Neversoft company so apparently now this frees up Harmonix to work on a rumored sequel to Frequency and Aplitude but as we learned about on a previous program

943
01:08:02,398 --> 01:08:07,044
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going to put one out on the PSP and it got, I guess, canned.

944
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:08,425
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what they're working on now.

945
01:08:08,445 --> 01:08:09,307
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be top secret.

946
01:08:10,308 --> 01:08:10,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

947
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:18,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there is actually something interesting going on, though.

948
01:08:18,218 --> 01:08:19,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Activision registered trademarks.

949
01:08:20,828 --> 01:08:24,691
[SPEAKER_05]: for two new games, Guitar Villain and Drum Villain.

950
01:08:25,712 --> 01:08:36,443
[SPEAKER_05]: The applications are stating that they're both the same thing, computer game software, downloadable software for use in connection with computer games, entertainment services.

951
01:08:38,284 --> 01:08:42,949
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to me that I think that they're really going to be expanding the franchise.

952
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:53,897
[SPEAKER_05]: And both of those applications also said that they'd be using toy guitars for video games, toys designed to be used for computer games or video games.

953
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:57,320
[SPEAKER_05]: The drum one sounds interesting.

954
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:01,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking, you know, sort of like what session mode was for Drum Mania.

955
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:13,013
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, you know, we need to keep in mind, in April last year, Red Octane placed applications to trademark Drum Hero and Keyboard Hero.

956
01:09:13,713 --> 01:09:14,014
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

957
01:09:15,558 --> 01:09:16,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen anything from those yet.

958
01:09:17,181 --> 01:09:18,543
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but it could be.

959
01:09:18,803 --> 01:09:29,320
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is interesting that, you know, Konami, who did the, you know, Bimani series, had a Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Keyboard Mania, so it's almost kind of...

960
01:09:30,137 --> 01:09:31,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Mirror Image.

961
01:09:31,798 --> 01:09:35,940
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll win their awards for Drum Hero and Keyboard Hero and Band Hero or whatever else.

962
01:09:36,581 --> 01:09:38,942
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so innovative.

963
01:09:38,962 --> 01:09:40,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen that before.

964
01:09:40,323 --> 01:09:41,363
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

965
01:09:41,683 --> 01:09:43,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami abandoned keyboard mania.

966
01:09:43,724 --> 01:09:46,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, I am all about bringing on the Keyboard Hero.

967
01:09:46,446 --> 01:09:46,946
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

968
01:09:46,986 --> 01:09:47,426
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

969
01:09:47,546 --> 01:09:49,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play Jump.

970
01:09:49,688 --> 01:09:56,011
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can put Jump in Keyboard Hero, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

971
01:09:56,111 --> 01:09:57,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me not everybody would want to play that.

972
01:09:58,830 --> 01:09:59,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Session Van Halen

973
01:10:18,072 --> 01:10:19,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Come out and try to say it's original.

974
01:10:19,493 --> 01:10:30,741
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's good about music games, though, the sales have been up about 80%, probably due to the fact of Guitar Hero 2 coming out, since it was, I think, one of the top-selling games in December.

975
01:10:32,022 --> 01:10:43,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a huge surprise, but a lot of people are starting to actually look at music games as possibly a way to get their music heard, including some quotes from...

976
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:45,713
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

977
01:11:06,431 --> 01:11:08,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really that much innovation going on.

978
01:11:08,453 --> 01:11:18,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say as much as I love and adore Konami for bringing over Beatmania and DDR, I think this kind of proves they didn't put enough faith in it in the beginning.

979
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:22,364
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that the games have taken off, other people are getting the credit for it in a way.

980
01:11:22,424 --> 01:11:32,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously the guitar game has been reinvented since then, but I think Konami might be kicking themselves a little bit for not taking a bigger risk and bringing more of those games over here a few years ago.

981
01:11:32,112 --> 01:11:33,773
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm really surprised that

982
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:39,522
[SPEAKER_01]: with Guitar Hero's success that they haven't jumped to try to bring drum here.

983
01:11:40,102 --> 01:11:40,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it time.

984
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:41,464
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know what might happen.

985
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:42,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

986
01:11:45,227 --> 01:11:46,188
[SPEAKER_02]: We will see, I guess.

987
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:52,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, supposedly they're having a big press conference pretty soon, Konami, and apparently we get to go, so we'll have all the latest for you.

988
01:11:52,953 --> 01:11:53,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently.

989
01:11:53,714 --> 01:11:54,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.

990
01:11:55,075 --> 01:11:56,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we don't get turned down.

991
01:11:56,636 --> 01:12:03,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have all the latest for you guys here on this program when that happens, which is in a couple weeks.

992
01:12:04,515 --> 01:12:17,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Talkin' now about the Wii a little bit, because, you know, one reason that people play dance games is to lose weight, and one thing that has people excited about the Wii is it's got you up and movin' around, so can you really lose weight playing the Wii?

993
01:12:17,403 --> 01:12:20,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, my kind of reaction when I saw it was like, well, not a lot.

994
01:12:20,025 --> 01:12:21,185
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not doing that much motion.

995
01:12:21,205 --> 01:12:24,387
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not supposed to do these grand, huge motions.

996
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:27,409
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only supposed to do little motions with your hand and all that stuff.

997
01:12:27,429 --> 01:12:32,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this website did this Wii Sports Experiment thing,

998
01:12:32,992 --> 01:12:38,635
[SPEAKER_02]: and apparently what they've done here is that they did a 30 day trial of playing the game.

999
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:45,598
[SPEAKER_02]: They ran, I think they played for 30 days for 30 minutes and the dude lost like 10 pounds.

1000
01:12:46,018 --> 01:12:46,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Without changing any diet.

1001
01:12:46,998 --> 01:12:47,999
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm sorry, it was six weeks.

1002
01:12:48,219 --> 01:12:53,401
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't change any diet or nothing and in 30 minutes of Wii Sports a day, he lost 10 pounds.

1003
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:57,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that's just probably more a result of being more active in general.

1004
01:12:57,712 --> 01:13:02,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of, you know, getting the body moving and waking up the muscles and things probably a little bit.

1005
01:13:02,296 --> 01:13:02,997
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably it.

1006
01:13:03,037 --> 01:13:04,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just an increase in activity.

1007
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:09,282
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, it would be, I would consider a low impact aerobic.

1008
01:13:10,043 --> 01:13:11,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, which is, it's better than nothing.

1009
01:13:12,245 --> 01:13:12,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1010
01:13:12,545 --> 01:13:14,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, cool on that.

1011
01:13:15,207 --> 01:13:17,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably something I need to go on because, you know.

1012
01:13:18,154 --> 01:13:18,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to quit my gym.

1013
01:13:19,075 --> 01:13:20,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gained a little weight lately.

1014
01:13:20,595 --> 01:13:21,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to lose it.

1015
01:13:21,316 --> 01:13:22,816
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I'll go on the weed diet as well.

1016
01:13:23,217 --> 01:13:27,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, WarioWare has kind of a mode in it that is encouraging the whole weight loss thing.

1017
01:13:27,859 --> 01:13:33,022
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a mode that is nothing but games that require big movements.

1018
01:13:33,602 --> 01:13:35,803
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's supposed to be a game that really gets you moving around.

1019
01:13:35,823 --> 01:13:37,024
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just need to play more DDR.

1020
01:13:37,064 --> 01:13:38,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to go to the gym.

1021
01:13:38,485 --> 01:13:39,965
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do need to just go to the gym.

1022
01:13:40,045 --> 01:13:41,726
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know my thing with gyms.

1023
01:13:41,746 --> 01:13:42,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Gyms are weird places.

1024
01:13:42,527 --> 01:13:44,548
[SPEAKER_05]: You can come with me and Extra for on Tuesday.

1025
01:13:44,728 --> 01:13:45,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll think about it.

1026
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:46,569
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk off air.

1027
01:13:47,717 --> 01:13:48,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll have a play date.

1028
01:13:48,618 --> 01:13:48,938
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1029
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:52,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Only if we get to... Never mind.

1030
01:13:52,601 --> 01:13:56,224
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get to go out for ice cream afterwards.

1031
01:13:56,304 --> 01:13:58,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's get ice cream after the job.

1032
01:13:58,386 --> 01:13:59,127
[SPEAKER_05]: That works for me.

1033
01:13:59,247 --> 01:14:00,628
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the kind of reward I need.

1034
01:14:01,169 --> 01:14:01,469
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1035
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:07,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, one reward we like to give our listeners is reading the stuff they have to write to us on air.

1036
01:14:08,014 --> 01:14:10,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And tonight we have our lovely mailbag segment.

1037
01:14:10,857 --> 01:14:15,861
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura reads the emails that you send to her at mailbag at orangelaunceradio.com live here on the air.

1038
01:14:16,192 --> 01:14:18,734
[SPEAKER_02]: and I believe we probably have an Uber mailbag segment tonight, don't we?

1039
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:19,355
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably have a lot.

1040
01:14:19,475 --> 01:14:19,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1041
01:14:20,235 --> 01:14:20,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Decent.

1042
01:14:21,216 --> 01:14:23,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I got rid of the spam, we had a few.

1043
01:14:23,418 --> 01:14:23,678
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1044
01:14:24,038 --> 01:14:29,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's get to some emails because I know we probably missed a few while we were out and I want to hear what the folks had to say.

1045
01:14:29,523 --> 01:14:31,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So, DarkSakura, who emailed us?

1046
01:14:32,945 --> 01:14:35,087
[SPEAKER_05]: First email of the night was from Rini.

1047
01:14:36,328 --> 01:14:37,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Salutations.

1048
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:39,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I love when an email starts with salutations.

1049
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:39,731
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just awesome.

1050
01:14:40,532 --> 01:14:44,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen to your last two podcasts of 2006 and would like to respond to some items of interest.

1051
01:14:45,410 --> 01:15:10,614
[SPEAKER_05]: on your Christmas Eve episode someone asked why iTunes keeps inexplicably stopping downloads as much as it pisses me off as well the only remedy I can offer to iTunes users when you're downloading a podcast make sure that not only is iTunes in the front most or active application but that you keep iTunes in its downloads feature up front as well you do this by starting a download in iTunes choosing downloads on the sidebar to the left of the iTunes window okay

1052
01:15:11,723 --> 01:15:25,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Since iTunes is already being pissy enough as it is, if you end up with an incomplete podcast, delete the incomplete file, go onto the podcast section of iTunes and click on the Orange Dodge Radio item, the one with the gray iTunes window, click unsubscribe, and then click subscribe.

1053
01:15:26,187 --> 01:15:33,330
[SPEAKER_05]: After you've recovered from doing all that, iTunes will have refreshed the list of all shows from the feed and immediately start downloading the latest show automatically.

1054
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:34,610
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's also great about that?

1055
01:15:35,151 --> 01:15:39,274
[SPEAKER_02]: The more people that click subscribe, the higher our ranking goes on iTunes.

1056
01:15:39,834 --> 01:15:43,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, inadvertently helping the station out, so I love this tactic.

1057
01:15:43,317 --> 01:15:44,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Kudos to Remy.

1058
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:50,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Regarding your end of the year show, I would like to say that Scott Rubin was quite pissed that he wasn't invited.

1059
01:15:51,523 --> 01:15:51,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Rebuttal?

1060
01:15:52,764 --> 01:15:54,125
[SPEAKER_05]: He would have been a great guest.

1061
01:15:55,986 --> 01:16:03,532
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Scott, I left the message on Scott's Xbox Live friends list, and he defriended me, so his loss.

1062
01:16:04,955 --> 01:16:05,636
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

1063
01:16:07,037 --> 01:16:22,891
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we picked the people we did is we wanted to get a mix of people that we have on the show a lot, like Bobby, and people we hadn't had on the show before, but respected, like VGO and Gamertag Radio and those other things.

1064
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott knows he's welcome on the show anytime he wants.

1065
01:16:26,434 --> 01:16:30,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So Scott, if you're still feeling butthurt about not being on the show, send us an email.

1066
01:16:30,678 --> 01:16:31,338
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to have you on.

1067
01:16:31,659 --> 01:16:31,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime.

1068
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:40,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, I don't believe it was reported on OLR, but the classic CD-ROM trivia game You Don't Know Jack semi-returns in web form at YouDon'tKnowJack.com.

1069
01:16:41,433 --> 01:16:44,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, questions only come in the form of Dis or Dat minigames.

1070
01:16:45,376 --> 01:16:49,178
[SPEAKER_05]: The best parts are that a new Dis or Dat is available daily holidays, too.

1071
01:16:49,759 --> 01:16:54,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the original hosts, I mean, Cookie?

1072
01:16:55,203 --> 01:16:56,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Cookie.

1073
01:16:57,044 --> 01:16:59,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Curiously, the site is also in beta form.

1074
01:17:00,643 --> 01:17:02,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a happy new year and keep on going, Rini.

1075
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:05,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, moving forward, we have one from AZHP.

1076
01:17:22,185 --> 01:17:28,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, all we're talking about Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun, and the possibility of RS2 on 360.

1077
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:38,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Just having gotten Ikaruga as a Christmas present for my girlfriend, I wanted to know what other games has Treasure made, especially games that were on systems in the realm of virtual console games.

1078
01:17:39,218 --> 01:17:43,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my Wii, and I'm an absolute VC game whore.

1079
01:17:43,861 --> 01:17:47,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Not because I played the games in my youth, I'm 18 and in college.

1080
01:17:47,506 --> 01:17:52,390
[SPEAKER_05]: but because my paltry $4 a week allowance didn't allow me to buy many $70 games in my youth.

1081
01:17:52,910 --> 01:18:07,301
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, Virtual Console is a haven for Shrump fans as I have Gunstar Heroes, Superstar Soldiers, Soldier Blade, and R-Type and love them all and I'm eagerly anticipating downloading Gradius as soon as I load up more points.

1082
01:18:07,682 --> 01:18:12,025
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, what treasure games are there that could possibly make their way to Virtual Console?

1083
01:18:12,425 --> 01:18:13,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Eagerly awaiting an answer.

1084
01:18:14,387 --> 01:18:15,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Sincerely, AZHP.

1085
01:18:15,728 --> 01:18:17,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually emailed back

1086
01:18:17,944 --> 01:18:25,168
[SPEAKER_05]: with a list and give me a second and I will definitely pull up the list that I did.

1087
01:18:27,209 --> 01:18:29,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here are the list of games that Treasure has made.

1088
01:18:31,171 --> 01:18:33,452
[SPEAKER_05]: For Arcadius, Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun.

1089
01:18:34,065 --> 01:18:46,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Dreamcast was Bongayo, Ikaruga, Game Boy Advance was Advanced Guardian Heroes, Astro Boy Omega Factor, Gunstar Superheroes, Hajime no Ippo, The Fighting, Tiny Toon Adventures, Buster's Bad Dream, I just totally don't see that coming out on Virtual Console.

1090
01:18:47,454 --> 01:19:03,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Boy Color was Tiny Toon Adventures, Dizzy's Candy Quest, Game Gear was Dynamite Headdy, Gunstar Heroes, GameCube was Dragon Drive, D-Master Shot, Ikaruga, Wario World, Genesis Alien Soldier, Dynamite Headdy, Gunstar Heroes, Light Crusader, McDonald's Treasureland Adventure, which I totally don't see coming on Virtual Console.

1091
01:19:04,285 --> 01:19:07,827
[SPEAKER_05]: and Yu Yu Hakusho, Makyo, Toitsusen, sorry.

1092
01:19:08,908 --> 01:19:11,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And then IQ, Sin and Punishment, Successor to the Earth.

1093
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:12,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Master System had Dynamite Headdy.

1094
01:19:13,891 --> 01:19:15,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo 64 was Buckret.

1095
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:16,393
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a bunch that came out.

1096
01:19:16,613 --> 01:19:18,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, Mission Makers, Bangaio.

1097
01:19:18,774 --> 01:19:19,875
[SPEAKER_05]: We had some Bleach games.

1098
01:19:21,255 --> 01:19:23,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Rakugaki Showtime, Silhouette Mirage.

1099
01:19:24,557 --> 01:19:26,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, the games that I see coming out...

1100
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:37,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that if they start expanding past the 16-bit era, which I kind of hope that they do, we might start seeing some of the Saturn 2D ones out.

1101
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:40,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see Radiant Silvergun and Guardian Heroes and Silhouette Mirage coming out.

1102
01:19:40,827 --> 01:19:43,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really think we get Saturn games on Virtual Console?

1103
01:19:43,409 --> 01:19:43,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

1104
01:19:43,569 --> 01:19:45,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really think we get Saturn games on Virtual Console?

1105
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:46,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why not.

1106
01:19:48,612 --> 01:19:49,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's shaking his head no.

1107
01:19:49,572 --> 01:19:50,753
[SPEAKER_05]: The 2D ones, I don't see why not.

1108
01:19:50,773 --> 01:19:51,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Too big.

1109
01:19:51,193 --> 01:19:51,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I think too big.

1110
01:19:51,913 --> 01:19:54,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Too big and the thing downloads as slow as shit as it is.

1111
01:19:55,709 --> 01:19:58,911
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't see why we wouldn't get some of the sprite-based ones.

1112
01:19:59,051 --> 01:20:04,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe on, I'm going to say it here and now, I bet you anything in the next three years, Nintendo announces a Wii HD.

1113
01:20:05,014 --> 01:20:06,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe on the Wii HD.

1114
01:20:06,615 --> 01:20:10,377
[SPEAKER_05]: But I totally see us getting something like Mischief Makers.

1115
01:20:11,038 --> 01:20:17,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally see, you know, Dynamite Headdy, a bunch of the other ones coming out.

1116
01:20:17,561 --> 01:20:19,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really see why not.

1117
01:20:19,783 --> 01:20:23,925
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not just for size, I think that it could definitely handle it.

1118
01:20:25,515 --> 01:20:27,036
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 makes a good point.

1119
01:20:27,116 --> 01:20:31,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Soundtracks will raise the file size, because if it uses Redbook Audio, then that's... Why would it use Redbook Audio?

1120
01:20:32,338 --> 01:20:32,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they?

1121
01:20:32,718 --> 01:20:33,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1122
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:34,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't some Saturn games use it?

1123
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:41,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Only some did, and then they started moving in toward the other... I can't remember off the top of my head.

1124
01:20:41,682 --> 01:20:43,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1125
01:20:43,663 --> 01:20:45,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Some games you can fully put in and just listen to, but...

1126
01:20:46,357 --> 01:20:47,478
[SPEAKER_05]: They started moving away from that.

1127
01:20:47,638 --> 01:20:52,841
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Second Mix, I remember, was just randomly some game I'm thinking of off the top of my head, like the PlayStation DDR game.

1128
01:20:53,001 --> 01:20:53,842
[SPEAKER_05]: The first DDR, yeah.

1129
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:56,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you could put it in a regular CD player and hear the songs.

1130
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:57,204
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a soundtrack.

1131
01:20:57,704 --> 01:20:59,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1132
01:20:59,885 --> 01:21:04,088
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot more games started moving past that, though, for compression.

1133
01:21:04,108 --> 01:21:12,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that if they were able to get some sort of increased storage capability for the Wii, I think we could totally start seeing...

1134
01:21:15,691 --> 01:21:18,212
[SPEAKER_05]: and other later generation system games.

1135
01:21:18,993 --> 01:21:19,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why not.

1136
01:21:19,673 --> 01:21:20,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it could fully handle it.

1137
01:21:21,494 --> 01:21:21,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see.

1138
01:21:23,735 --> 01:21:24,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Not this year.

1139
01:21:25,336 --> 01:21:28,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just glad to see that other people like Treasure, because I love Treasure.

1140
01:21:30,459 --> 01:21:35,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, next email, we have one coming from Nike.

1141
01:21:36,742 --> 01:21:38,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, OLR, I'm here again.

1142
01:21:38,683 --> 01:21:40,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Got quite a lot to say, but I'll try to keep it short.

1143
01:21:41,591 --> 01:21:42,472
[SPEAKER_05]: What's an MMO?

1144
01:21:42,632 --> 01:21:44,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it like a World of Warcraft style game?

1145
01:21:44,553 --> 01:21:48,115
[SPEAKER_05]: MMO is Massively Multiplayer Online.

1146
01:21:49,356 --> 01:21:52,357
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean MMORPG, Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplay Game.

1147
01:21:52,878 --> 01:21:55,879
[SPEAKER_05]: MMO means Massively Multiplayer Online.

1148
01:21:56,139 --> 01:22:00,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Which basically means you're playing with hundreds of people or thousands of people at once instead of just two or three.

1149
01:22:01,322 --> 01:22:01,823
[SPEAKER_02]: All online.

1150
01:22:01,863 --> 01:22:02,723
[SPEAKER_02]: You're all in like a world.

1151
01:22:02,743 --> 01:22:04,044
[SPEAKER_02]: They're usually world type games.

1152
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:09,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking on the HMV UK website, they're saying they're selling Excite Truck.

1153
01:22:10,243 --> 01:22:12,324
[SPEAKER_05]: for pre-order for February for 50 pounds.

1154
01:22:12,404 --> 01:22:15,485
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nearly $100 a disc and case in some paper.

1155
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:16,405
[SPEAKER_05]: What a rip-off.

1156
01:22:16,705 --> 01:22:17,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, no, it's really fun.

1157
01:22:18,826 --> 01:22:20,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I wouldn't pay $100 for it.

1158
01:22:20,707 --> 01:22:20,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1159
01:22:22,147 --> 01:22:23,648
[SPEAKER_05]: C, what kind of music do you lot like?

1160
01:22:24,328 --> 01:22:26,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie mentioned ASH, which is number one of my favorites.

1161
01:22:27,009 --> 01:22:32,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob also mentioned the music from Elite Beat Agents, which has stuff like Sum 41.

1162
01:22:33,271 --> 01:22:35,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Me, my favorite bands are Gorillaz and Payne.

1163
01:22:37,105 --> 01:22:39,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Actual bands or video game music?

1164
01:22:39,807 --> 01:22:41,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just picking music.

1165
01:22:41,168 --> 01:22:49,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when it comes to video game music, I love all the stuff that Mizuguchi is a part of, like Space Channel 5 and Luminous and all that stuff is awesome.

1166
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:52,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Nobuo Imatsu.

1167
01:22:53,396 --> 01:22:56,738
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to real music, which I know sounds so horrible.

1168
01:22:56,758 --> 01:22:57,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I love listening to trancy stuff.

1169
01:22:57,939 --> 01:22:58,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes.

1170
01:22:58,419 --> 01:22:59,800
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on what I'm in the mood for.

1171
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,961
[SPEAKER_02]: And shoes.

1172
01:23:02,822 --> 01:23:04,242
[SPEAKER_02]: What have I been listening to a lot lately?

1173
01:23:04,283 --> 01:23:04,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know.

1174
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,481
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that Icelandic?

1175
01:23:08,462 --> 01:23:08,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Bjork?

1176
01:23:09,063 --> 01:23:09,303
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1177
01:23:09,723 --> 01:23:10,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Roixop.

1178
01:23:10,304 --> 01:23:10,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I like them.

1179
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:11,384
[SPEAKER_02]: They're cool.

1180
01:23:11,585 --> 01:23:12,005
[SPEAKER_05]: They're cool.

1181
01:23:12,105 --> 01:23:12,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like them.

1182
01:23:13,466 --> 01:23:15,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I also like Death Metal.

1183
01:23:17,489 --> 01:23:17,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

1184
01:23:18,009 --> 01:23:18,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you do.

1185
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like Gwar.

1186
01:23:20,691 --> 01:23:24,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I've been listening to, really weirdly, I've been listening to a lot of Morrissey lately.

1187
01:23:25,135 --> 01:23:28,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Mainly, you know, because Morrissey was our emo when we didn't have emo.

1188
01:23:29,178 --> 01:23:30,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I love synth pop.

1189
01:23:30,139 --> 01:23:30,879
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been my big thing.

1190
01:23:30,919 --> 01:23:34,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever since DDR Ultramix 2 really got me into synth pop, like Echo Image and all that crap.

1191
01:23:34,895 --> 01:23:35,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

1192
01:23:35,355 --> 01:23:35,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't get enough of it.

1193
01:23:37,496 --> 01:23:39,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Dee, you don't have the Nintendo Point Store in the U.S., do you?

1194
01:23:41,539 --> 01:23:42,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they still working on that?

1195
01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:43,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't looked.

1196
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:43,940
[SPEAKER_01]: A what?

1197
01:23:44,581 --> 01:23:45,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo Point Store.

1198
01:23:46,682 --> 01:23:48,062
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't have that in the U.S.

1199
01:23:48,863 --> 01:23:49,884
[SPEAKER_05]: The channel was there.

1200
01:23:50,224 --> 01:24:00,409
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the Point Store, what they're talking about, it's basically kind of like what they have for the Nintendo Club, I think, in Japan, where you buy titles and you earn points or stars.

1201
01:24:00,429 --> 01:24:01,850
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're all pissed we don't have it.

1202
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:03,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, we don't have it.

1203
01:24:05,176 --> 01:24:09,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, why doesn't Nintendo partner with voiceover IP like Skype?

1204
01:24:09,437 --> 01:24:10,898
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wiimote has a speaker plus mic.

1205
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:11,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it just has a speaker.

1206
01:24:12,198 --> 01:24:15,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Why doesn't Nintendo actually have some online games for the Wii yet?

1207
01:24:15,919 --> 01:24:20,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's because for some reason they feel they need to roll it out slowly.

1208
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:20,920
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whatever.

1209
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:21,661
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their strategy.

1210
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:26,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow they feel they're ahead in innovation in some parts and they're really behind in other parts.

1211
01:24:26,222 --> 01:24:26,962
[SPEAKER_01]: So, whatever.

1212
01:24:28,122 --> 01:24:30,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these questions I think we've actually already answered before.

1213
01:24:32,057 --> 01:24:37,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And so skipping through, I'm going to say, what does all our team think of renting games?

1214
01:24:38,661 --> 01:24:39,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Good way to test them out.

1215
01:24:40,001 --> 01:24:42,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something I should be doing that I'm not, honestly.

1216
01:24:42,963 --> 01:24:47,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I should be using that Gamefly or comparable type service, and I'm not.

1217
01:24:47,906 --> 01:24:48,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to look into that.

1218
01:24:49,267 --> 01:24:52,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe I would have avoided buying Red Steel.

1219
01:24:52,689 --> 01:24:53,709
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an interesting question.

1220
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:56,030
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you go about getting a job in the game industry?

1221
01:24:56,150 --> 01:25:00,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering as I have many career paths open for me at the moment, including being a doctor.

1222
01:25:01,773 --> 01:25:02,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you just chance into it.

1223
01:25:02,993 --> 01:25:07,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a friend who was a math major who now is a programmer for a company in the Bay Area.

1224
01:25:07,975 --> 01:25:09,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Shane, you kind of work in the game industry.

1225
01:25:09,816 --> 01:25:10,656
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you get your job?

1226
01:25:11,912 --> 01:25:12,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Accident.

1227
01:25:13,333 --> 01:25:13,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1228
01:25:13,933 --> 01:25:16,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just, whoops, now I work at a game company.

1229
01:25:16,874 --> 01:25:20,555
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on people you know or if you look at Craigslist.

1230
01:25:21,115 --> 01:25:25,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of video game companies post entry-level positions there all the time.

1231
01:25:26,377 --> 01:25:29,018
[SPEAKER_02]: But you really have to be in an area where there's game companies.

1232
01:25:29,118 --> 01:25:29,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1233
01:25:29,978 --> 01:25:32,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Or your skill needs to be high in demand.

1234
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you live in Wichita, Kansas, no offense, Shane.

1235
01:25:36,701 --> 01:25:37,361
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you used to live.

1236
01:25:37,994 --> 01:25:41,316
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live there, then you're probably not going to find a whole lot of gaming jobs.

1237
01:25:41,356 --> 01:25:43,137
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I got my job.

1238
01:25:43,177 --> 01:25:45,199
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you're here in California, aren't you?

1239
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:47,880
[SPEAKER_02]: It's best if you live where?

1240
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Bay Area, L.A.?

1241
01:25:49,721 --> 01:25:51,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Wherever the major game companies are.

1242
01:25:51,322 --> 01:25:56,986
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got Washington, the Redmond area, and then you've got the Bay Area, and then you've got L.A.

1243
01:25:57,606 --> 01:25:59,927
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where you want to go for the major ones.

1244
01:26:01,248 --> 01:26:07,132
[SPEAKER_02]: The reality is, though, if you're sitting there thinking, I've got a great idea for a video game.

1245
01:26:07,152 --> 01:26:07,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Wisconsin.

1246
01:26:08,707 --> 01:26:10,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they have the one company there.

1247
01:26:10,529 --> 01:26:15,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, because I was thinking about Megzi.

1248
01:26:15,872 --> 01:26:18,814
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of major metros have at least one.

1249
01:26:18,854 --> 01:26:23,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind that the industry, though, is very, very diverse.

1250
01:26:24,357 --> 01:26:26,798
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be an artist, get in as a designer.

1251
01:26:27,059 --> 01:26:28,439
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be a writer.

1252
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:32,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I was asked if I was interested in writing game manuals.

1253
01:26:33,374 --> 01:26:36,937
[SPEAKER_05]: and part of why I was going to school was to actually do manuals.

1254
01:26:36,957 --> 01:26:37,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Why'd you turn that down?

1255
01:26:38,358 --> 01:26:38,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't turn it down.

1256
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:40,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I called on it and didn't hear anything.

1257
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:43,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was actually for writing strategy guides.

1258
01:26:43,602 --> 01:26:45,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to hear that.

1259
01:26:45,523 --> 01:26:46,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in school to do what I want to do.

1260
01:26:46,944 --> 01:26:48,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be a massage therapist.

1261
01:26:48,826 --> 01:26:55,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I could freaking be an independent contractor for a video game company giving massages during people's lunch.

1262
01:26:56,437 --> 01:26:57,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac Bell does that.

1263
01:26:57,758 --> 01:26:59,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of major companies do.

1264
01:26:59,278 --> 01:27:00,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Our company does too.

1265
01:27:00,459 --> 01:27:03,761
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could work in the video game industry as a massage therapist.

1266
01:27:04,901 --> 01:27:05,721
[SPEAKER_05]: It's possible.

1267
01:27:06,642 --> 01:27:08,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to have that be your catch on this show.

1268
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:12,405
[SPEAKER_02]: She works in the game therapy, giving massages and happy endings.

1269
01:27:12,785 --> 01:27:13,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give happy endings.

1270
01:27:14,085 --> 01:27:14,946
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny, though?

1271
01:27:14,966 --> 01:27:24,590
[SPEAKER_05]: We learned that in San Francisco, in the county, for you to be a massage therapist there, it's considered adult entertainment, so you're lumped in the same category as prostitutes.

1272
01:27:25,431 --> 01:27:25,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot.

1273
01:27:26,178 --> 01:27:29,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I hate it.

1274
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:32,840
[SPEAKER_05]: The last question, I doubt that PS3 will sell many due to its high prices in the UK.

1275
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:35,021
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a lot over here.

1276
01:27:35,081 --> 01:27:36,921
[SPEAKER_05]: We get bummed at everything in gaming.

1277
01:27:38,301 --> 01:27:40,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Most young gamers already have a 360 or at least a Wii.

1278
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:45,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Just thinking about how much market it will really have apart from now.

1279
01:27:45,163 --> 01:27:47,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, it's Sony's stupid fanboy impression.

1280
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:52,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I must say the graphics do look good, no better than 360, though, and played one with Ridge Racer.

1281
01:27:53,441 --> 01:27:54,321
[SPEAKER_05]: But you played Ridge Racer.

1282
01:27:54,421 --> 01:27:56,862
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not going to... Play Resistance, honestly.

1283
01:27:56,902 --> 01:28:00,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that one really plays up the system's capabilities well.

1284
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:04,423
[SPEAKER_05]: So, apart from that, though, yeah, the rest of it's crap.

1285
01:28:05,683 --> 01:28:07,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I failed to keep it short, but oh well.

1286
01:28:07,223 --> 01:28:08,083
[SPEAKER_05]: This week has been busy.

1287
01:28:08,143 --> 01:28:10,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to college next week, so hope that goes well.

1288
01:28:10,104 --> 01:28:11,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Until next time, Neki.

1289
01:28:12,344 --> 01:28:13,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for the email.

1290
01:28:13,064 --> 01:28:13,804
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a lot of questions.

1291
01:28:13,924 --> 01:28:16,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like... Yeah, and I actually skipped... 20 questions from our UK...

1292
01:28:17,946 --> 01:28:18,647
[SPEAKER_02]: A UK fan.

1293
01:28:18,687 --> 01:28:20,270
[SPEAKER_05]: He got to L, but one repeated.

1294
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:20,851
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

1295
01:28:21,131 --> 01:28:21,492
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

1296
01:28:21,732 --> 01:28:22,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we have two more emails to go.

1297
01:28:22,915 --> 01:28:23,135
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1298
01:28:24,638 --> 01:28:28,485
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is from one of our listeners in Belgium, Fabrice.

1299
01:28:28,525 --> 01:28:28,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Fabrice.

1300
01:28:31,029 --> 01:28:34,131
[SPEAKER_02]: You know one good thing I liked that all games had at their little thing?

1301
01:28:34,311 --> 01:28:38,354
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a big map of the world, and every time they got a caller from somewhere, they'd put a pin in the map.

1302
01:28:38,755 --> 01:28:40,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we totally need to steal that idea.

1303
01:28:41,156 --> 01:28:41,657
[SPEAKER_05]: For our email.

1304
01:28:41,777 --> 01:28:43,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking about, well, we could do both.

1305
01:28:43,358 --> 01:28:44,259
[SPEAKER_02]: We do emails on callers.

1306
01:28:44,439 --> 01:28:46,521
[SPEAKER_02]: We have blue pins for emails, red pins for callers.

1307
01:28:48,502 --> 01:28:51,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only discovered OLR since episode 180 or something since then.

1308
01:28:51,324 --> 01:28:52,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been listening every week.

1309
01:28:52,164 --> 01:28:54,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I can't listen to your live show because I live in Belgium.

1310
01:29:20,544 --> 01:29:23,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder what you at OLR think of the current state of Sega.

1311
01:29:23,426 --> 01:29:26,647
[SPEAKER_05]: The last years, they've done nothing but release crappy game after crappy game.

1312
01:29:27,128 --> 01:29:33,211
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as they use the EA technique, release as much games as you can and you'll earn money easily.

1313
01:29:33,511 --> 01:29:36,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic the Hedgehog was somewhat the epitaph for what they are doing.

1314
01:29:36,893 --> 01:29:43,417
[SPEAKER_05]: They only had some good titles, but only the short period after the Dreamcast was dead, like Panzer Dragoon Orta, etc.,

1315
01:29:44,113 --> 01:29:47,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a Sega fanboy, but it's even hard for me to get excited about a new Sega title.

1316
01:29:48,577 --> 01:29:52,560
[SPEAKER_05]: All I'm looking forward to is Sega Rally Revo and Virtua Tennis 3.

1317
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:54,322
[SPEAKER_05]: What is wrong with them?

1318
01:29:54,382 --> 01:29:55,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they miss their own console?

1319
01:29:55,783 --> 01:29:57,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they go with the times?

1320
01:29:57,865 --> 01:29:58,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they lacking the talent?

1321
01:29:59,406 --> 01:30:06,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Will the Dreamcast days ever return when they made games like Virtua Tennis, Crazy Taxi, Shenmue, Rez, etc.?

1322
01:30:06,893 --> 01:30:10,216
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all highly playable, enjoyable, and everyone, not only the hardcore gamer...

1323
01:30:11,043 --> 01:30:12,725
[SPEAKER_05]: and for everyone, not only the hardcore gamer.

1324
01:30:13,105 --> 01:30:16,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Sega wasn't afraid to experiment and come up with some crazy ideas.

1325
01:30:16,528 --> 01:30:18,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, I wonder what your thoughts on Sega are these days.

1326
01:30:18,589 --> 01:30:20,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up the good work and DarkSakura Disneyland rules.

1327
01:30:21,071 --> 01:30:21,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you.

1328
01:30:25,335 --> 01:30:25,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1329
01:30:26,156 --> 01:30:27,176
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a tough question.

1330
01:30:27,637 --> 01:30:32,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that Sega was making systems for so long and now they only make games.

1331
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:37,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So there has to be some downsizing that comes with that and some of your biggest talents jump ship.

1332
01:30:37,905 --> 01:30:38,886
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just in a funk.

1333
01:30:39,787 --> 01:30:40,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I think

1334
01:30:40,842 --> 01:30:47,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I think though that when you are making games for your system, you know how to make it work on your system.

1335
01:30:47,348 --> 01:30:57,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that is a lot of strength that when it's your product and you have all the in-house stuff available to you, you know how to make the most of it.

1336
01:30:57,918 --> 01:31:03,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think that that might be hurting them with some of the newer titles, but also I think that honestly...

1337
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:11,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to say it, but Sega's going to need to get back on the track and find out what made them great to begin with.

1338
01:31:11,402 --> 01:31:16,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, instead of doing all the flashy, showy stuff, they need to get back to the heart.

1339
01:31:16,283 --> 01:31:18,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that they need to take a, you know, page from Nintendo.

1340
01:31:19,564 --> 01:31:22,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Phantasy Star Universe wasn't bad, in my opinion.

1341
01:31:22,905 --> 01:31:23,925
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't great.

1342
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:25,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not really average games.

1343
01:31:25,185 --> 01:31:27,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Full Auto was awesome, and Chromehounds is...

1344
01:31:28,496 --> 01:31:31,198
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, again, most people didn't like Full Auto or Full Auto 2.

1345
01:31:31,498 --> 01:31:34,061
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of in your own little bubble there.

1346
01:31:34,481 --> 01:31:35,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed it.

1347
01:31:35,141 --> 01:31:35,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed Full Auto.

1348
01:31:35,902 --> 01:31:37,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I did end up selling it back, but I enjoyed it.

1349
01:31:37,824 --> 01:31:39,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Full Auto 2 is kind of eh.

1350
01:31:39,725 --> 01:31:44,869
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, hell, they've got a ton of cool games coming out pretty soon.

1351
01:31:45,069 --> 01:31:47,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonic and the Secret Rings, which should be pretty cool.

1352
01:31:47,451 --> 01:31:50,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as long as the control is good on it.

1353
01:31:51,034 --> 01:31:51,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtua Fighter 5.

1354
01:31:52,235 --> 01:31:54,917
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's going to be a pretty solid fighting game for the PS3.

1355
01:31:54,957 --> 01:31:56,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Sega Rallye Revo.

1356
01:31:58,655 --> 01:32:03,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Armored Core 4, the game that I've been waiting for for the longest time.

1357
01:32:03,596 --> 01:32:11,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought Chromehounds thinking, hey, maybe it's like Armored Core 4, but no, it's like Armored Core 4 with Mono or something like that.

1358
01:32:13,138 --> 01:32:14,159
[SPEAKER_05]: We need Knights on Wii.

1359
01:32:14,899 --> 01:32:16,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say some interesting comments from chat.

1360
01:32:16,779 --> 01:32:19,800
[SPEAKER_02]: DDRDollarBill says, Sega needs to make more games that are unique.

1361
01:32:22,061 --> 01:32:26,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Bandit says, first Sega starts making consoles, then drop that and just got into games.

1362
01:32:26,602 --> 01:32:27,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony, you're next.

1363
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:33,182
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt has an idea on how Sega can get back to their roots.

1364
01:32:33,242 --> 01:32:35,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Two words, blast processing.

1365
01:32:48,089 --> 01:32:49,550
[SPEAKER_05]: SEGA TASANSHIRO!

1366
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:16,810
[SPEAKER_02]: or, you know what, I hate to say it, but since Nintendo doesn't have the oomph behind it, you know, with the Wii, the Wii doesn't have that pretty stuff.

1367
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:28,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there will be inevitably an F-Zero game on the Wii that will be pretty awesome, but seriously, like, if Sega made a racer kind of like that, I'm not talking full auto, on the 360, oh, that would be hot.

1368
01:33:28,577 --> 01:33:29,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it would be hot.

1369
01:33:29,238 --> 01:33:31,960
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, actually, franchise, I wouldn't mind seeing coming out on the next system.

1370
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:32,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Or PS3.

1371
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:37,463
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a, I believe it was a Sega, it was Burning Rangers franchise.

1372
01:33:38,888 --> 01:33:41,970
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I know it was because the music was on freaking Samba de Amigo.

1373
01:33:42,470 --> 01:33:45,212
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need Burning Rangers to come back.

1374
01:33:45,973 --> 01:33:49,395
[SPEAKER_02]: To clarify for chat, because they're saying F-Zero was done by Sega, not the original, obviously.

1375
01:33:49,435 --> 01:33:53,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I meant the GameCube version in Arcade, GX and AX.

1376
01:33:54,078 --> 01:34:02,844
[SPEAKER_02]: AX was Namco, Sega, Nintendo, the Triforce, and then GX was just Sega and Nintendo.

1377
01:34:02,884 --> 01:34:06,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you what, booting that game for the first time and seeing both those logos on the screen at the same time

1378
01:34:07,438 --> 01:34:09,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a weird feeling for me, the 80s gamer.

1379
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:09,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1380
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:12,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it make you feel happy in the pants?

1381
01:34:12,703 --> 01:34:14,224
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it made me feel weird.

1382
01:34:15,726 --> 01:34:18,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at this going, but Sega does what Nintendo don't.

1383
01:34:19,029 --> 01:34:21,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't... This is beyond comprehension.

1384
01:34:22,272 --> 01:34:22,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Another email?

1385
01:34:22,892 --> 01:34:24,093
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually was the last of our emails.

1386
01:34:24,113 --> 01:34:24,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it wasn't?

1387
01:34:24,394 --> 01:34:24,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Another window opened.

1388
01:34:25,274 --> 01:34:25,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1389
01:34:26,275 --> 01:34:27,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, send us more.

1390
01:34:27,897 --> 01:34:28,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Send us more.

1391
01:34:28,818 --> 01:34:31,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1392
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:31,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure after...

1393
01:34:32,677 --> 01:34:35,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our stories tonight, we'll get plenty of emails.

1394
01:34:35,038 --> 01:34:36,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, dude, Battletoads vs. Double Dragon.

1395
01:34:36,859 --> 01:34:38,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah, we need a new one of that.

1396
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:39,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Sega do that?

1397
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:42,842
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on Genesis.

1398
01:34:42,882 --> 01:34:45,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't Tecmo responsible for both those franchises?

1399
01:34:45,523 --> 01:34:46,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

1400
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:51,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Streets of Rage was Burning Knuckle.

1401
01:34:51,086 --> 01:34:51,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Battletoads was Rare.

1402
01:34:52,527 --> 01:34:55,008
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Battletoads was Acclaim, I want to say.

1403
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:56,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll remember.

1404
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:58,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Making me go to Wikipedia.

1405
01:34:59,722 --> 01:35:03,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so anyways, we've got some interesting stuff about Nintendo, actually.

1406
01:35:03,544 --> 01:35:08,327
[SPEAKER_01]: MadCatz is doing a third-party Wiimote that looks like a penis.

1407
01:35:09,027 --> 01:35:11,328
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, way to go, MadCatz.

1408
01:35:11,428 --> 01:35:16,111
[SPEAKER_01]: You've taken the Wii and made it look like a sex toy.

1409
01:35:17,191 --> 01:35:17,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.

1410
01:35:18,472 --> 01:35:21,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, it's supposed to be more ergonomic looking, but it looks like a penis.

1411
01:35:22,034 --> 01:35:22,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1412
01:35:23,575 --> 01:35:24,055
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um,

1413
01:35:25,106 --> 01:35:28,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Be sure to pick up your third-party penis by Mad Catz.

1414
01:35:28,788 --> 01:35:29,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming soon.

1415
01:35:30,769 --> 01:35:31,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Joy.

1416
01:35:31,329 --> 01:35:31,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely.

1417
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:37,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember them saying they were going to have the third-party Wiimotes, but it's kind of interesting to see what some of them look like.

1418
01:35:37,672 --> 01:35:38,573
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like a penis.

1419
01:35:38,873 --> 01:35:39,953
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't.

1420
01:35:40,094 --> 01:35:41,614
[SPEAKER_01]: It does so look like a penis.

1421
01:35:41,894 --> 01:35:42,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the balls?

1422
01:35:43,355 --> 01:35:44,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, just a shaft.

1423
01:35:45,516 --> 01:35:45,996
Let me see.

1424
01:35:47,937 --> 01:35:49,358
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a vibrator.

1425
01:35:49,898 --> 01:35:52,840
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't look like any penis I've ever seen.

1426
01:35:53,662 --> 01:35:54,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.

1427
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:55,564
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a sex toy, though.

1428
01:35:57,205 --> 01:36:08,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, and with those freaking homemade programs that you can use your Bluetooth devices for, including the Wii vibrator thing, there you go.

1429
01:36:08,974 --> 01:36:10,916
[SPEAKER_01]: They've made a complete package for you.

1430
01:36:11,737 --> 01:36:13,678
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, thank you, Wikipedia.

1431
01:36:13,758 --> 01:36:16,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Battletoads was a video game franchise by Tradewest.

1432
01:36:17,241 --> 01:36:20,083
[SPEAKER_02]: The first game was released by Rare for the NES in 1991.

1433
01:36:22,435 --> 01:36:22,956
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1434
01:36:23,196 --> 01:36:26,600
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember, I think TradeWest had something to do with Double Dragon too, if that makes sense.

1435
01:36:29,263 --> 01:36:31,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they made the original Double Dragon on the NES.

1436
01:36:31,666 --> 01:36:32,027
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1437
01:36:32,527 --> 01:36:33,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Or published it, whatever.

1438
01:36:34,149 --> 01:36:34,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1439
01:36:35,771 --> 01:36:38,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, this is a good time for us to take a break, I think.

1440
01:36:38,513 --> 01:36:40,815
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for a little while here, so we're going to take ourselves a little break.

1441
01:36:41,315 --> 01:36:44,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will come back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1442
01:36:44,878 --> 01:36:49,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

1443
01:36:50,322 --> 01:36:54,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
