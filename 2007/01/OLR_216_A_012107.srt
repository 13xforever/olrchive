1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
New developments with the Guitar Hero series, including Drum Villain, and Can You Fix a

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Broken 360 with Towels?

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,320
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,720
I say welcome back because we missed a show last week, but we'll get into that in a moment.

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,160
First, let's introduce ourselves.

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,880
We are that podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know about video

7
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,080
game culture and the video game lifestyle.

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
My name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,480
Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
Yo, what up?

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,640
How are you doing, Ms. Summers?

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,480
I'm alive, sort of.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,480
That's good.

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
That's good.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,160
I had a very good time last week on our weekend off with you.

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,400
We had a great time.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
Myself and Dark Sakura and the OLR lesbians all went to Disneyland, and it was a good

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
time.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,680
We had a very interesting time.

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,360
And I know some listeners sometimes give Jamie a hard time because she talks about Disneyland

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,000
a lot on this show, and I'm one of them.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,420
I have a hard time talking about Disneyland so much on this program, but I kind of get

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,420
it now.

24
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,840
We've had a great time, and it really is something else.

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,240
Space Mountain four times.

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,360
Rocking Space Mountain four times in a row was awesome.

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,600
I think it's just really cool.

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,160
I remember that we have day jobs.

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,880
OLR is not what we do for a living, and it's just kind of nice to have a week off to go

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
have nothing but fun.

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,760
And that's what Disneyland was really all about, was just fun and good friends and good

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
times.

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
It was great.

34
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
I had a really good time.

35
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
Group hug.

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
All right.

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,720
Anyway, also joining us tonight, say hello to Loki.

38
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
Hello.

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
How you doing, Loki?

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm fine.

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
What did you do last week?

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:21,120
I also went to that same reception with Loki.

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
That's right.

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,680
And you went to the folks who got married through Final Fantasy XI, right?

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Yes.

46
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,040
You don't play Final Fantasy XI anymore, though, right?

47
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,040
I did for the past two weeks.

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
What made you...

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
But you quit again.

50
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Yes, I quit again.

51
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,840
So what made you decide to start playing Final Fantasy XI and then quit again?

52
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,980
Because I missed it, and then when I came back, I played it, and then I didn't miss

53
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,980
it anymore.

54
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,020
So it was time to cancel.

55
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,040
What made you decide you did the right thing by quitting?

56
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,360
What do you mean, what made me decide?

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,440
Well, because you said you went back for two weeks, and then you quit.

58
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,880
So obviously, you must have come to the conclusion during those two weeks that, oh, I made the

59
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
right decision quitting.

60
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Oh, yeah.

61
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,240
Well, because being a blue mage is freaking boring trying to get those spells, and when

62
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,240
you spend two hours hunting this one monster, trying to get one spell off of it, you realize

63
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,640
that your time could be better spent somewhere else.

64
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,680
Like looking for a party.

65
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
All right.

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,600
Look at the chatroom comments here at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

67
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,640
We always invite the chatters to always be another guest here on the program, and they

68
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
have their comments.

69
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,280
We have some really good voicemails this week, by the way.

70
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,560
We're going to get to it later on in Part B. Just another way we encourage you guys

71
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,200
to interact with us.

72
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,620
Shadow Slayer says, just sat around and talked equals strippers.

73
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,620
Is this true?

74
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,160
No, it's just in his mom's coffee shop, so sitting around talking is literally sitting

75
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
around talking.

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,360
Lattes and strippers, good times.

77
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
I wish.

78
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,840
Nellie and I were hoping for strippers with fireworks and jet packs, and we actually almost

79
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,480
got somebody to believe that that was going to happen, but they were an idiot, so it doesn't

80
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
matter.

81
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,560
That would be Kat, and she was an idiot.

82
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,840
Wait, like literally.

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,240
Does Kat listen to this program?

84
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Can she defend herself?

85
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,720
I don't think she knows how to operate a computer, okay?

86
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
All right.

87
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
She's a complete idiot.

88
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
All right.

89
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,160
Well, welcome back, of course, to all of our live listeners and our podcast listeners since

90
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,720
there was no program last week.

91
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,960
Again, we apologize for not being here, but now that the holidays are over and we're all

92
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,400
back into our daily routine, unfortunately, we're kind of in a situation where Jamie's

93
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,060
doing school in the early evenings, and Loki has to go to bed early for his job, which

94
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,680
takes out the late evenings, so it's very hard for us to pre-record when we're not here

95
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,640
on Sundays, so sorry about that, but that's what happened.

96
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,580
If you were here listening live, though, Travis Donovan from our Saturday Night program on

97
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:40,320
Orange Launch Radio did a real fantastic little tribute program, and if you listen to one

98
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,520
of our buddy podcasts, All Games Interactive, Dark Soccer and I appeared on the Friday edition,

99
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,760
and it was something else.

100
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
It was a good time, though.

101
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
It was slightly embarrassing.

102
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Yeah.

103
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
It was a good time.

104
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
I had fun.

105
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
That's what it's all about.

106
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,240
I need to find the podcast for that since I wasn't there.

107
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,320
I didn't really.

108
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
You were missed, though.

109
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,280
They kept saying it was two-thirds of Orange Launch Radio.

110
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
Where's Loki?

111
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
Why isn't he here?

112
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
Why doesn't he like us?

113
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,320
We had to kind of explain that, so it was good, though.

114
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,520
I didn't realize that their Free Play Fridays were so free, but it was a good time.

115
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
I had a really good time.

116
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,280
Thanks to Scott for having us on.

117
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
It's good.

118
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,640
I like doing radio with Scott because he plays such different types of games than we do that

119
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,520
it's fun to kind of debate a little bit.

120
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,080
We got into that a little bit on the Free Play Friday show before things all went to

121
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,600
hell in a good way.

122
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
We had a really good time.

123
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
We hope to go back sometime.

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,780
We've gotten some real positive feedback from that.

125
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,120
I know there was something in the mailbag that maybe Dark Soccer is going to read for

126
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
us later.

127
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
I think we had a voicemail, too.

128
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,880
I don't think we were going to play the voicemail, but somebody had left us a voicemail and said

129
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,880
it was really great.

130
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,640
We love doing radio with those guys and kind of coming together in that Voltron-esque sense

131
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,960
to do radio together.

132
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
It was cool.

133
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,240
Miklotov says, how about Power Rangers instead?

134
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,840
I'm going to say Power Rangers ripped off Voltron.

135
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,440
Does anybody watch Power Rangers anymore except you?

136
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,400
There's another guy at my work that does, and we're going to have an Operation Overdrive

137
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,240
party when the new season premieres.

138
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,120
Let's talk a little bit about how is your gaming week, because that's how we always

139
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
like to start off the show.

140
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,120
We've got a couple of weeks to cover here, so we'll start off with Dark Soccer.

141
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
How was your gaming week?

142
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,080
I played Cook and Mama and Astro Blasters at Disneyland.

143
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
It counts as a game, right?

144
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,000
Astro Blasters is one of the best video games I've ever played in my life.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,360
That was some good times.

146
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,440
We might be getting another pinball machine that you would be interested in.

147
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
What's that?

148
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
Bride of Pinbot.

149
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Sweet.

150
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
Very cool.

151
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
I told Dan to try to get it for me.

152
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,120
Not a lot of console stuff otherwise?

153
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Not really.

154
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,760
I almost got rid of PSU and then went, nah.

155
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:53,760
I turned on Guild Wars and then said, nah.

156
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,880
It just went through the whole booting and patching and that whole process.

157
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
You were like, nah.

158
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
Yeah, pretty much.

159
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
That was it.

160
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
All right.

161
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Good times.

162
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,320
Loki, how was your gaming week?

163
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
My gaming week was good.

164
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:11,760
I had a gaming party last night actually and Rob was there and he can attest to the fact.

165
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:19,160
WarioWare Smooth Moves is fun but playing it with 11 people at the same time is crazy

166
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,160
and it adds a whole new element of fun into it that I don't even know how to describe.

167
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,600
I have never had a video gaming experience quite like 11 player WarioWare.

168
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,120
I don't know how to describe it.

169
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
It was insane.

170
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,040
Just so you guys know, in WarioWare, you only get to use one baton.

171
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,200
They call it the baton in the game but it's Wiimote.

172
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,080
You only get to use one Wiimote in multiplayer.

173
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:51,520
So part of the fun of it was actually passing off the baton in time to other people.

174
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,280
It was actually kind of funny.

175
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,480
The whole thing is ridiculous.

176
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:01,160
They have your Miis flying around like this angel form and it really looks weird.

177
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:07,560
So you have all these weird Mi faces with this angel body thing that doesn't even fit

178
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,520
and then you have these games that you're playing and it keeps getting faster and everyone

179
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
was just cracking up.

180
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,840
It was just a lot of fun.

181
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,760
Did you notice how OLR totally dominated the multiplayer games?

182
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,960
Because you won one, Megalotov won one, Extra for won one and I won one.

183
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
We played it four times.

184
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Well, we played games more than that.

185
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
No, I know.

186
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
That's true.

187
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
So we did that.

188
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
That was really fun.

189
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,940
But that's just because at this gamer party, you had some casual gamers there.

190
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,000
What were the level of people like Tiffany and Heather and the other Rob?

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,740
Did they play a lot of games?

192
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,440
My sister plays quite a bit.

193
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,160
She's finished Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 and she's played through Zelda and all this stuff.

194
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
So she plays quite a bit.

195
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,040
She has my GameCube right now.

196
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
Because they were all into it.

197
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,840
The only person that didn't seem so into it was Nellie.

198
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
She was kind of like, I hate this.

199
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Nellie doesn't play too many games.

200
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
But she laughed.

201
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
I mean, she just laughed.

202
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,240
And then Tiffany really doesn't play that many games.

203
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,780
I think she may play a little bit of the Xbox, but she wants to get a Wii.

204
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,560
She doesn't have one yet.

205
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
So that's funny.

206
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,160
And then Mel, of course, plays some stuff.

207
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,360
And everyone plays a pretty average amount of games and stuff.

208
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,300
So I think a lot of people really liked it and definitely people that were going to get

209
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,640
a Wii are probably going to get this game as well because it's just crazy.

210
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
The dance mini game was hilarious.

211
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,640
Yeah, Shane shared this idea with us that you can do the dance.

212
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,560
You go into the mode where you just play a mini game over and over again and you do the

213
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,120
dance mini game, but you set it on the fastest setting.

214
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
It's pretty funny.

215
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
It's fun to watch.

216
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,760
Yeah, it's crazy.

217
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,160
And then we played Resistance Fall Man.

218
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,880
We've been playing that all week during lunches and we played that last night too for a while.

219
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,440
And I had a really interesting glitch after you left.

220
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,020
We were playing multiplayer.

221
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,280
First we started off with just doing four player multiplayer and stuff.

222
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,780
And that's a fun game, multiplayer.

223
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,420
Then we decided rockets only, infinite ammo.

224
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,920
And we picked really tiny maps.

225
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:06,800
And that was pretty fun, except one time I spawned and I just kept flying up into the

226
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
air.

227
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
So it was really weird.

228
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,680
That was kind of funny.

229
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,000
You guys were playing Red Steel at one point too.

230
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That's about it.

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,280
I was going to get to Red Steel.

232
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Did it play as god awful as it looked?

233
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,340
Because I haven't really played a lot of Red Steel, but that game did not look fun when

234
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,040
you guys were playing a multiplayer.

235
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,240
It was not like when everybody was playing WarioWare where everyone knew what to do.

236
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,880
The thing shows you how to hold the controller and you kind of take it from there.

237
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,640
But Red Steel was like, how do I hang up the phone?

238
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,800
What the hell am I doing?

239
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,960
I had never played Red Steel four player.

240
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,640
I've only done it two or three.

241
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,960
So I figured, okay, let's give it another try on a bigger TV so you can actually see

242
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,840
what's going on and stuff.

243
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,200
And so four player, I thought it'd be cool if we tried the mode where the Wiimote rings

244
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,320
like a phone and you pick it up and you get a mission from the person on the line.

245
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,140
Well, it's a cool concept, but it's completely annoying and stupid at the same time.

246
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,840
So Red Steel really sucks.

247
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,280
You can't control it for shit.

248
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,240
The little phone mode, I mean, the thing is ringing all the goddamn time and stupid shit

249
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,920
like kill the cook and it'll use an Uzi or something like that.

250
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,400
And if you don't pick up the phone, it'll just keep ringing for you and it's just really

251
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
annoying.

252
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,040
You know, this is the last draw for this game.

253
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,440
I'm definitely selling it back now.

254
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,520
I mean, it was a complete waste of money in the first place.

255
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,920
It's just an utter disappointment.

256
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,420
I wanted to give it a second chance and so I did and it's awful.

257
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,960
That's the first time you asked me like, do you want to play this?

258
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,440
And I was like, no, I don't.

259
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Yeah.

260
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,880
So that really sucked.

261
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,560
And then I'm trying to think what else we played there.

262
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,200
Rob D. in chat agrees with you.

263
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Loki's right.

264
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Phone mode sucks.

265
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
It always rings.

266
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
You can't hear it.

267
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,840
I mean, it sounded like a cool concept in the beginning, you know, when they were talking

268
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,640
about it, but it's just horribly, horribly executed.

269
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,720
So, you know, I can't recommend that game at all.

270
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,360
And then finally, you know, we're playing more Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, which

271
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,640
I hear is now coming out on PlayStation 2.

272
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,280
My boss will be extremely happy about that.

273
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,320
And just, you know, the usual stuff.

274
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,000
But yeah, right now Wario War is going to have to hold me over until SSX comes out.

275
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,680
It kind of sucks with only one game coming out in the month, but that's about it.

276
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
All right.

277
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
Can I make an interjection?

278
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
Sure.

279
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Why not?

280
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
There's one other game.

281
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Okay.

282
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
What's that?

283
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
R-Type 3.

284
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Oh, on the virtual console?

285
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
Oh, yeah.

286
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
How was that?

287
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,280
Well, I actually never had R-Type 3 before, so it was actually really fun.

288
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,440
And I love the mode 7-tastic stuff that happens in it, because as you're going through it,

289
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,920
it's like it fully has a real 3D feel to it.

290
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,920
And my favorite thing is, like, right at the beginning, when these, I guess, sort of mini-boss

291
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,760
type things pop up, you can kill them in one, you know, charge shot.

292
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,440
And then another one comes up behind you, and then he swings around you, and then you

293
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,580
bitch can't kill him.

294
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,280
And then he suddenly looks behind him and runs into a wall and blows up.

295
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,160
You know, how is it as a shooter game?

296
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,280
I was contemplating getting it.

297
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
I don't know much about R-Type.

298
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
It's R-Type!

299
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,480
I can get it!

300
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,400
I never really owned a Turbo Grafx-16 or a Sega back in the day.

301
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
Did you get the first R-Type?

302
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
I did.

303
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,120
And it kind of reminded me of Gradius, really.

304
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
It was just like Gradius.

305
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
It's hard.

306
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
It is.

307
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
It was a little harder than Gradius.

308
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
R-Type is hard.

309
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,760
R-Type 3 is, sort of to me, like a faster paced R-Type.

310
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
For eight bucks?

311
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,640
Should I spend eight bucks on it?

312
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Yeah!

313
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
Sure!

314
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
R-Type!

315
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,260
It's actually one of the only R-Type games, actually I think, yeah, that was specifically

316
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,260
for Super Nintendo.

317
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,260
Check it out.

318
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,260
Check it out.

319
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,260
It's worth it.

320
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,260
Maybe you should come over to your house and play it first.

321
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,260
No, you're going to download it.

322
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,260
Alright, fine.

323
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,680
Let's see how you are.

324
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,520
Miklotov, how was your gaming week?

325
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
What have you been playing?

326
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,920
Well, I'm still playing the crap out of Elite Beat Agents because I can't get enough of

327
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:05,680
it and I'm almost down to zero everything except for Elite Beats on Jumping Jack Flash

328
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,360
on Elite Beat Viva's difficulty.

329
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,640
And let's see, I just picked up Final Fantasy III for the DS because it's in stock again,

330
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,240
which is nice, and I played Final Fantasy for two weeks and now I'm playing Burning

331
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
Crusade.

332
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Oops.

333
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,240
How's Burning Crusade?

334
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,360
My blood elf is really pretty and he jumps around and twirls, it's great.

335
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,400
What made you decide to go on to Burning Crusade?

336
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:41,840
Everybody else is doing it and I like to follow people, so I'm easily swayed.

337
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
And it's fun.

338
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
I like it.

339
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
It's cool.

340
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Alright, good times.

341
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
You want to tell people your server and characters?

342
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
They can come play with you?

343
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Or would you rather stay anonymous?

344
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
I don't care.

345
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:59,000
My server is Ravencrest and my character's name is Arx and I'm a 13 blood elf priest.

346
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,020
Is there any reason why you chose Ravencrest?

347
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,560
Because it reminded me of Ravenclaw because that sounds like something Harry Potter-ish.

348
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Alright.

349
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,600
I was going to say, as you mentioned, that Final Fantasy III is back in stock now.

350
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,200
They've been actually sold out of a lot of stuff, especially the DS Lite.

351
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,960
Nintendo is actually completely sold out now.

352
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,840
They should be coming to the stores in the next week or so, finally catching up.

353
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Same with the Wii.

354
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,840
The Wii's been sold out for a while too.

355
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,720
Nintendo's kind of slow right now.

356
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,200
Sony's kind of showing them up with the amount of units they're getting out there, but no

357
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,680
one's buying them.

358
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,240
Well, my gaming week, a lot of the same stuff most people have actually already beaten me

359
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
to and mentioned.

360
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,560
You know, there was Buzz Lightyear ride at Disneyland, which was a lot of fun.

361
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,020
You know what's weird is that the first time we went through it, we rode that ride three

362
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,920
times and the first time was our best score.

363
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,600
We should post that picture on Orange Lounge somewhere.

364
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,200
It's kind of funny.

365
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,440
You got the 38th best score for the day or something, the high score.

366
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
I think so.

367
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
You kicked my butt at it.

368
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,240
Out of how many thousands of people that went on it?

369
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,560
Well, the whole reason we got so high of a score was because it broke down while we were

370
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
on it.

371
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,600
Yeah, because the other times we never stopped in the middle of the ride.

372
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,800
I've done really well on that ride.

373
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,080
I can at least get to a rank four on a regular run-through.

374
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,000
But then I was chatting from the hotel room with Bobby over at All Games and he's like,

375
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
well, I got a million.

376
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Did you get a million?

377
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm like...

378
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,720
Yeah, but his ride stopped too.

379
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,760
All right, so I played that.

380
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,360
I've gone back to World of Warcraft thanks to Burning Crusade, which is funny though

381
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,720
because I didn't buy Burning Crusade.

382
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,920
There's not a lot in Burning Crusade for me because I'm not all like, ooh, ah, over Blood

383
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,200
Elves and Draenei because everybody is playing those.

384
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,240
And especially if you look at the server that Shane and I are playing on, because we always

385
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,640
start on a freaking new server, Ravencrest.

386
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,860
I'm playing a Tauren on Ravencrest.

387
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,600
I'm not running into anybody.

388
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,880
It's like a new server.

389
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,720
All I see are Blood Elves and they're all paladins and they make me want to punch them

390
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,720
because it's annoying because they're all just kind of ganging up on my kills I'm trying

391
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
to get.

392
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,100
Yeah, so it's interesting.

393
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,520
And I thought, well, there's not a lot in Burning Crusade for me.

394
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
I mean, sure, there's new areas.

395
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,920
You can level to 70 in the jewelcrafting.

396
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,240
But I'm like, okay, I don't want to make that investment unless I actually stick with World

397
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
of Warcraft.

398
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,000
Because if you've been listening to this show for a couple of years, you know that I'm notorious.

399
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,820
I'll play World of Warcraft for three months, quit, then start over again in a couple months

400
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,820
on a new server.

401
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:31,480
But actually, I said, okay, Rob, if you can get a character to level 40, I will reward

402
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,800
you by buying Burning Crusade.

403
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,440
There you go.

404
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,640
And I'm already at what, 11 or 12?

405
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,880
Well, yeah, but the first 10 levels you can do in like an hour.

406
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
Whatever.

407
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:48,240
Anyway, but what's funny is that since Shane had the discs, I installed it on the computer

408
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,360
and so I still have like the pretty intro screen.

409
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,160
But it's kind of neat to have Burning Crusade installed but you don't have access.

410
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,720
So if you're kind of wondering, like if you're out there wondering what happens if I like

411
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,000
Borrow a Friend's discs but I don't have the code, you still get some things changed

412
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,040
like the intro screen and some of the loading screens.

413
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,360
And certainly, you know, you can see everybody but I don't think the game will let you do

414
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,760
anything special outside of that.

415
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,480
That's probably all I'm really getting from that.

416
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,200
So I am going to have to buy a code at some point.

417
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,880
When I get to level 40, that's my reward for myself.

418
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,200
I've also been playing WarioWare Smooth Moves.

419
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Love it.

420
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,720
It's an awesome game.

421
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,560
But I think it kind of suffers from the WarioWare series syndrome where that I don't see much

422
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:29,360
– let me rephrase that – I don't see much single player replay ability after about

423
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,480
five hours with the game because once you've unlocked all the mini games, not a lot else

424
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
to do.

425
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,200
And that's kind of the same way all the WarioWares have been in the past.

426
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,680
But multiplayer is really cool and I think really breathes more life into the game that

427
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,120
the other WarioWares didn't have so much.

428
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,480
I mean, I know the GameCube one had multiplayer that was kind of fun but this one especially

429
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
because, you know, the more pick up and go element of it.

430
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,680
So I think if you have people that you can play this with – like if you're the type

431
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,360
of person that would own Mario Party, you definitely should own WarioWare.

432
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,680
But if you're just one person, I actually think this is a title that's a really good

433
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
rental.

434
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,840
Like it's probably the best rental title right now possibly out there because I do

435
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,080
think it's the type of game you're going to breeze through pretty quickly.

436
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,080
It's fun.

437
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
It's easy to pick up.

438
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,720
It's got a great sense of humor.

439
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,020
A lot of the characters from the old WarioWare games are back but, again, I just don't

440
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,520
see where there's going to be a lot to this game after you've played it for three hours

441
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,520
unless you are a perfectionist and you must master every game.

442
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,080
But if you're a Nintendo fanboy, you probably already own it so what are you listening to

443
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
me for?

444
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,980
Well, would you agree with that, Logie?

445
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,520
You know, this whole thing kind of reminds me of, you know, there could be more life

446
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,760
in this game if they had, I don't know, leaderboards or something like that supported

447
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,900
on the Nintendo Wii but since they don't and Nintendo's a fucking retard for not

448
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,920
doing that, you know, there's not as much life as there could be, you know?

449
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
I don't know.

450
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,040
Simple fixes like a leaderboard system or something for each individual game would be

451
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
pretty cool.

452
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
All right.

453
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,880
Well, I think that's about, do I have anything else for my gaming week?

454
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Not really.

455
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
I've just pretty much been playing those.

456
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,760
Not a whole lot of, oh, no, there is one new game I wanted to mention also.

457
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,920
I bought Heavy Weapon on Xbox Live Arcade which is a PopCap game, you know, the folks

458
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,080
that made Bejeweled and Zuma but Heavy Weapon is a very different type of game.

459
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
It's not a puzzle game.

460
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
It's more of an action game.

461
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,080
It reminds me of an old 16-bit shooter and a lot of people have been giving Heavy Weapon

462
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,580
a lot of crap because, you know, they go, oh, another PopCap game.

463
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,160
It's coming out after Ms. Pac-Man.

464
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,280
God, the live arcade line-up sucks, you know.

465
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,440
I could play this on, you know, for free on Flash and da-da-da-da-da.

466
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,500
I think a lot of people are passing judgment on this game before playing it and I would

467
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,560
bet some of your favorite bloggers are doing this too after reading one or reading some

468
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,840
bloggers because people were posting those types of opinions before the game even came

469
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,840
out.

470
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,200
So they were basing their opinions, I know this, off the Flash version of the game.

471
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,040
I do think you should download the demo and check it out, especially if you like those

472
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,540
old 16-bit type of shooters because it actually is a lot of fun and I played multiplayer with

473
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,720
some strangers to, you know, try and get some more achievements and just kind of have fun,

474
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
see what it was all about.

475
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,240
I actually thought it was pretty fun and I know you can't do the multiplayer through

476
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,100
the free Flash game and there's a lot of different types of stages.

477
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,960
I actually think it's kind of an underrated purchase right now.

478
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,520
I think I enjoyed this much more than I enjoyed Small Arms or Novidrome or some of those other

479
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,880
originals they were really hyping up or RoboBlitz even.

480
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,500
I didn't really enjoy any of those games as much as I enjoyed Heavy Weapon.

481
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,000
So I really think don't listen to people who pass judgment on this game just because

482
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,520
it's PopCap and they have it, you know, on the website.

483
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,240
You know, if the website is good enough for you and you play the net with them, fine,

484
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,460
you know, then you don't need to spend the $10.

485
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,600
But if you enjoy those types of games, I think you'd really benefit from multiplayer and

486
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,000
some of the other modes this game has.

487
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,740
I had a lot of fun with it and I kind of want to play it again when, you know, my TV is

488
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,880
free of Elibits because Xtaphir has been playing Elibits non-stop.

489
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
He beat it.

490
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
I saw the final boss in the game.

491
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,720
It was like this Voltron Elibit type thing.

492
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
It's crazy.

493
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,560
It was like I didn't know Elibits was so long.

494
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:06,080
I guess it has like 25, 26 stages and the stages in that game go on for like 10-20 minutes

495
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
at a time.

496
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,840
So there's quite a bit of replayability in Elibits, I was surprised.

497
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,000
I do recommend Heavy Weapon for those fans of shooters, at least even if you just have

498
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
access to Xbox Live.

499
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Check out the demo.

500
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,720
You might like it.

501
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,640
Well that's pretty much all I got for How Was My Gaming Week.

502
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,040
So that's all of us.

503
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,480
So now we're going to go on to housekeeping, which we don't really have a lot of this week.

504
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,400
There's not a lot of new news going on with the station.

505
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,560
You know, we still have our site trucking along and hope to bring you a new website

506
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,640
pretty soon, although it's a lot of work we're finding.

507
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,420
Also just a reminder, we do have programming here on orangeontrader.com almost every week

508
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,240
night throughout the week.

509
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,640
First Tuesday of every month, Dark Soccer is live with Pump Up The Volume, so she's

510
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,640
due for a new show pretty soon.

511
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,160
Wednesday nights, guys on the show, myself and Exeterfer.

512
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,260
Thursday nights, STFU with DMN and DJ Tyrant.

513
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,120
Friday night, Club OLR mixed by Loki.

514
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,200
And Saturday nights, Travis Donovan live, which is always pretty hilarious and he does

515
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,160
a lot of the chat room interaction stuff too.

516
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,440
So check those shows out.

517
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,200
And getting on into the news this week, this was something we actually talked about on

518
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,760
one of the spinoff shows.

519
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,120
And I'm sure you've heard this story talked about to death in the various gaming blogs

520
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,080
out there and on the various websites out there.

521
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,600
We don't want to spend a whole lot of time on it tonight.

522
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:27,320
But I do find it very ironic that the week we decide to take off a show, huge news happens

523
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,680
literally in our backyard.

524
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,920
I mean literally.

525
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,380
And of course we're referring to the Hold Your Wee for a Wee contest that one of our

526
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,680
local stations here, 107.9 held.

527
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,040
Our morning rave show or whatever held this Hold Your Wee for a Wee contest.

528
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,280
And unfortunately it ended, or I should say resulted, because it was about a couple hours

529
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,240
after the contest ended, resulted in the death of Jennifer Strange, a 28-year-old who was

530
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,560
trying to win a wee for her family.

531
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,680
And what's very interesting, Jennifer Strange lives, or lived, not even about two miles

532
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,520
from where we record Orange Lawn's radio.

533
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,000
So it's kind of, it was kind of weird, kind of hit home that whole story.

534
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,040
At first, I don't know about you guys when you heard about this, but at first I was kind

535
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,920
of thinking this isn't, because I was reading about it on Kotaku, Destructoid, and all those

536
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
gaming blogs.

537
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,260
I was thinking this really isn't about gaming.

538
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,080
I mean I understand why these sites covered it, so I'm not trying to fault that or anything,

539
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,480
but I'm kind of thinking to myself, we're really digging a hole for this.

540
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,120
I mean it's not really about the gaming.

541
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,600
I mean surely it's a tragic story, but that goes more to the whole where was the responsibility,

542
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,800
the DJs, the station, the woman that competed in the contest, you know, all that types of

543
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,940
back and forth.

544
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,360
But then, earlier this week, I caught something very interesting on the nightly news, because

545
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,260
as you can imagine here in this area, in the Sacramento area, this story has really dominated

546
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:52,520
the nightly news, just as when three years ago, someone passed away of the same thing

547
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,680
in a frat hazing in Chico.

548
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,620
I mean that dominated our local news for the longest time, a water intoxication took the

549
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,620
life of theirs.

550
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,960
Somebody was telling me at work the other day, in the past, I think in the past five

551
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,080
years in the Sacramento region, three people have died of water intoxication, which is

552
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,080
abnormal.

553
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
That's not normal.

554
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,120
So it's weird that, you know, move to Sacramento, don't drink water.

555
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,280
It's sort of like drowning yourself.

556
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Well, it is.

557
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,000
Essentially, it's kind of what you're doing.

558
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,960
But anyway, so I'm thinking, okay, it's not really gaming related.

559
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,520
I don't know if we should talk about it on Sunday's show, because it's kind of been talked

560
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
about to death.

561
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,840
But then this late breaking thing happened.

562
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,120
I caught the news on Thursday, okay, and I posted about this to OrangeLawnTrader.com.

563
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,560
We were watching local news and they were talking about this whole thing.

564
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,240
The reporter, I guess, had talked to the lawyer, and the reporter said that they were considering

565
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,800
expanding the lawsuit that was filed against the station.

566
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,400
I mean, obviously, a civil lawsuit was filed in her death.

567
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,280
I mean, I think we all saw that coming.

568
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,880
The lawsuit is being considered to expand Nintendo and promoters for Justin Timberlake,

569
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,640
because Justin Timberlake's tickets were involved in this concert, too.

570
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,040
They were in the contest, too.

571
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,520
They were a consolation prize.

572
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,240
And now, it's kind of, well, now we're kind of roping it back into gaming, because Nintendo

573
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,120
could get sued over this whole thing.

574
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,640
It's stupid.

575
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
It's really stupid.

576
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
They had nothing to do with it.

577
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, too.

578
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,440
I mean, unless they can prove that Nintendo somehow sponsored this contest, which I doubt,

579
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,800
I highly, highly, highly doubt they would sponsor a contest called Hold Your Wee for

580
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
a Wee.

581
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,480
They would have never done that, okay?

582
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,320
So unless they can somehow prove that Nintendo sponsored this contest, I don't see that really

583
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,480
happening, that they're going to be able to sue them, but maybe that's what they're exploring

584
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
right now.

585
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
I don't know.

586
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,840
I don't know if Nintendo's a large company, and he thinks that he can get money from them,

587
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,840
so it makes perfect sense that they would want to do that.

588
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
Same with Justin Timberlake.

589
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,120
You know, the guy's got money, so let's try to get a piece of it, a piece of the money.

590
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,080
Because the station, I mean, granted, the station's probably part of a big network,

591
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,400
maybe not so much money there.

592
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
I don't know.

593
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,440
And although I can understand where her family's coming from, I mean, it was very tragic what

594
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,240
happened to her, although I do believe she is partially to blame, I felt she was more

595
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,840
to blame until I heard the audio of the whole thing.

596
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,480
When I heard how crass the DJs were and talking about, you know, well, they signed waivers,

597
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,600
what's the worst thing about it, and the fact that people had called them.

598
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,520
I had a co-worker who listened to it, and she was telling me at work about how the one

599
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,800
doctor we all heard about was not the only one to call in.

600
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,420
She said at least two doctors called in telling them not to do it, and they still continued

601
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,420
to do it anyway.

602
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:23,120
So while, yeah, I kind of fault her for participating, I think there's blame.

603
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
It's just tragic.

604
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,280
The whole thing's tragic.

605
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:32,560
I think, first of all, she deserves a Darwin Award, and too bad she's already bred.

606
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:38,600
Any person with a brain in their head would know that you cannot hold your urine that

607
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
long.

608
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,520
It is, you're holding a toxin in your body.

609
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,040
You can't drink that much water.

610
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,760
Now, she deserves her Darwin Award.

611
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,440
The DJs also, I think, were responsible for not thinking it through, for being pretty

612
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,320
much, yeah, they were idiots.

613
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,920
They also deserved to be Darwinized, unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet.

614
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,880
But I don't think in kind of and sort of, I believe in every party was at fault.

615
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
She was at fault.

616
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,060
She deserves it.

617
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,060
They were at fault.

618
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,720
They deserve to be fired and worse.

619
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,320
I don't think anyone deserves to die.

620
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,280
I mean, we all do stupid shit for our kids.

621
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,500
But you know what I mean, though?

622
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,840
She earned her death.

623
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,280
I just kind of think maybe she had some type of trust in the radio station that she wasn't

624
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,720
doing it like that they hadn't already researched.

625
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,760
They probably didn't know that it was, I mean, because it's basically okay who can hold it

626
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,000
the longest and before they have to go.

627
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
That wasn't the issue.

628
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,160
It wasn't because she held back her urine that she died, it was because she drank gallons

629
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,560
and gallons of water really quick, and it wouldn't have mattered even if she went afterwards

630
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,680
because I'm assuming she did go afterwards, the damage was already done.

631
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,440
The thing is, is now they had them fill out waivers.

632
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,460
Well, they have generic waivers that the radio stations have people fill out for their contests.

633
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,600
It's basically saying, oh, we don't hold you liable for this and this.

634
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,360
But they didn't disclose, at least it seems like from what I've heard on the radio and

635
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,620
stuff, the recordings of it, they didn't really disclose what possible dangers were and say,

636
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,000
you might die from this if there's too much or something like that.

637
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,760
I don't think they did their research, or if they did, they just completely shrugged

638
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,160
it off.

639
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,720
That's really what the issue is.

640
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,820
It's not a matter of if they signed waivers or not, it's just they didn't disclose the

641
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,800
possible risks of participating in this activity because not everyone is aware that drinking

642
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,820
that much water could cause you to die.

643
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,840
You would just think that you just have to really go to the bathroom really bad.

644
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,880
With a lot of these people not knowing, you can't really hold them responsible for that.

645
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,840
Granted, it's a stupid thing, but hey, if someone gave me the opportunity to drink some

646
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:55,480
water and hold my pee for a $250 thing, sure, I'd give it a shot, but if I started feeling

647
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,360
sick, I would stop.

648
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,400
I think that kind of thing doesn't make you feel sick.

649
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,440
That's kind of the difference there.

650
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
I don't know.

651
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
Miklotov?

652
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,840
I thought they said that she stopped when she did feel sick.

653
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,120
She did re-quit the contest.

654
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,640
When I read about it, I didn't know about water poisoning.

655
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,800
I was like, okay, that's crazy.

656
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,200
How could you not know about it?

657
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,900
You can drink so much water that it kills you.

658
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,320
You're pretty much saturating.

659
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,760
But it being a radio contest, I thought they would have taken the precautions to warn the

660
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,920
contestants and stuff, or at least have somebody on hand.

661
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,920
I'm not saying at all that the DJs in the station were not at fault.

662
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,880
I'm saying that there's equal fault.

663
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,640
Maybe everybody doesn't know that you can drink yourself of water to death.

664
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,960
I thought it was common sense.

665
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,600
Interesting perspective in the chat room.

666
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,520
Mike W. says, Dark Soccer, it's not the DJ's fault for doing what his boss told him.

667
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,080
I do agree to an extent, and that's why 10 people were fired over this.

668
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,000
That's why certainly a lot of people, not just the DJs, were fired.

669
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,280
But I'm telling you, if you listen to the audio, which is available on one of our local

670
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:08,160
newspapers, sacb.com, has audio of the whole thing, and you listen to the DJs kind of going

671
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:14,080
like, wow, you've got a really big belly, and knowing the result, you can't help but

672
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:22,400
feel like, whoa, they were way too bold for the whole thing.

673
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:32,060
My whole point is that anything that's going to affect the body, you really, really need

674
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,320
to understand what the risks are before you decide to do it.

675
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
That's my point.

676
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:43,200
It came out more harshly than I intended it to, but I think, and I'm not saying anyone

677
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,400
deserves to die, but I'm saying that if you die of your own ignorance, then that is on

678
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
you.

679
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
I'm sorry.

680
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,360
But they did have, and I think that they should have been more than fired.

681
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,800
I think they really need to stand trial for it.

682
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,960
But I think that those that were in charge of the contest, they had a duty to make sure

683
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,680
that the risks were put out there.

684
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,680
I guess for the people who don't have common knowledge of this.

685
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
All right.

686
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,280
Well, we could talk for hours and hours about this.

687
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,480
Hell, we did on Wednesday's show.

688
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,240
We talked for at least an hour about this.

689
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,460
But in the interest of getting more news, I'm directly involved with gaming.

690
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,760
We do want to move on.

691
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,600
We do welcome your emails and voicemails on this topic, but please keep in mind, since

692
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,160
this is a controversial issue, we're probably not going to get to read everything we get

693
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
on it.

694
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,360
But we do welcome your thoughts.

695
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,400
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com or our voicemail, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

696
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,760
Let's move on and talk about some news that is definitely directly about gaming.

697
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,000
Who's got something for us?

698
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I do.

699
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
All right.

700
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
We're going to talk about some dates here.

701
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,280
We had a lot piling up actually in the last two weeks and even some stuff we announced

702
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,920
on the site a little bit, but yet no one seems to be picking up on that.

703
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,360
Lots of stuff being announced this week, especially on all the big sites.

704
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,080
They were announcing a crazy taxi for the PSP, not a big surprise, and that's coming

705
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,020
June 13th.

706
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:12,400
Some other stuff, Two Worlds, the PS3 version, I guess, is being delayed to October 10th

707
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,040
and then the Xbox 360 one will be coming out in May on the 16th.

708
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,280
So that's some stuff that we probably already knew about.

709
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,520
However, there are a lot of things that many people haven't heard about yet and some stuff

710
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,020
that's a little bit surprising.

711
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:37,000
First off here, we've got a bunch of no-brainer titles like a new bunch of movie-based stuff.

712
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Ratatouille for pretty much every system out there except for the original Xbox to tie

713
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,600
in with the upcoming Pixar movie.

714
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,440
Of course, we've got Surf's Up also tying with the new movie coming out and that's coming

715
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,400
out in May.

716
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:02,520
What's interesting though, beyond all that stuff and like Spider-Man 3 and Transformers

717
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,960
and Shrek the Third, we do have some interesting stuff like Dog Island.

718
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,760
I don't know if you remember when they were first showing off the Wii stuff in Japan.

719
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,960
I thought it was a Hudson game but it's basically that character, the dog, where they have the

720
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:24,680
super giant heads, kind of almost like, I don't know, some sort of toy thing over there.

721
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,640
That's coming out on PlayStation 2 and the Wii, May 23rd, which is kind of interesting.

722
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:34,040
Some bigger stuff though, Final Fantasy Fables, Chocable Tales, that's going to be coming

723
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,800
out on the DS April 25th.

724
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,200
Dawn of Mana, finally making its way out to the PlayStation 2, that's May 15th.

725
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,680
And then of course Guitar Hero 2 for the 360 is going to be coming out at the end of March

726
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,520
on the 28th and that's pretty big.

727
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,360
And then some other interesting stuff, Motorstorm, MLB 07 The Show, and God of War 2 have all

728
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,240
been delayed a month to March 14th now.

729
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,580
So that's kind of interesting.

730
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,400
Same with F.E.A.R. also got delayed to that time.

731
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,960
And then of course the big one that we announced on the site, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic

732
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,540
has been announced for the Xbox 360 and I know that was something that was being rumored

733
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:23,280
to have happened ever since, actually before the 360 even came out, so it's kind of interesting

734
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,680
there.

735
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:32,200
And let's see, and then other interesting stuff, Samurai Slash, which would be Samurai

736
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:37,560
Warriors, the Koei game, coming to the Wii and that's going to be May 16th.

737
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:45,520
Fatal Inertia, Blade Storm, also coming out on the 360 and the PlayStation 3, April 18th,

738
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:52,160
which Koei actually came out and officially said Summer, but April 18th is more accurate.

739
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,640
Kane and Lynch, now this one I'm kind of shaking my head with, because I thought it was PlayStation

740
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:03,200
3 and the 360, but we have an announcement for PlayStation 2 and the 360, so I don't know,

741
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,700
but that's interesting.

742
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:12,420
June 20th for that one, and then that's probably all the big stuff I would say.

743
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,420
Just lots of dates.

744
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,880
I'm going to post more on that under the radar thread though, if you want to check out the

745
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
details there.

746
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,160
You should be posting some of that to the front page, really.

747
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,200
I've not heard of God of War being pushed back, that's news to me.

748
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,800
Of course, I haven't been following for that story very closely.

749
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,720
This one's kind of cool too, Senko no Rondo, for the 360, it's an Ikaruga style shooter.

750
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:38,520
That's coming out May 16th as well, so yeah, lots of big stuff.

751
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,040
Alright, well thanks for the insight, how about some, what's coming out next week?

752
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:49,120
Yeah, not much, not much of anything actually.

753
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,360
Next week is a bunch of portable games, and that's pretty much it.

754
00:36:52,360 --> 00:37:02,400
Let's see here, I know we've got the, what is it, Hotel 219, 213, my mistake.

755
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,840
That's going to be coming out on the DS.

756
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,160
Miggletop, you've been talking to me about this game a lot today, why are you so excited

757
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
about it?

758
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,880
There's a lot of people that do Trace Memory, and I love Trace Memory for the two hours

759
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:21,640
that you get to play it for, and it's just like a film noir looking, oh it's 215, it's

760
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:27,000
just like a film noir thing where you're like some detective guy and you hold your DS like

761
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
book style.

762
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Like brain training?

763
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,760
Yeah, and it's just an adventure game, it's great.

764
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Okay.

765
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,280
And other stuff on the PSP, Legend of Heroes 3, Song of the Ocean, which is another edition

766
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:46,520
of the RPG series, Inuyasha Secret of the Divine Jewel on the DS, Sid Meier's Pirates

767
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:55,520
on the PSP, and then some PC stuff, of course we've got Europa Universal's 3, another strategy

768
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:02,040
game, and Alien Shooter Vengeance on the PC, and then Sam and Max Episode 3, The Mole,

769
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,640
The Mob, and The Meatball.

770
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,840
More episodic content for you.

771
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Alright.

772
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:13,520
Well, I have our UK release dates, if anybody is interested.

773
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:22,120
On the 26th coming out is Arthur and the Minimoys on DS PC, PSP and GBA and PlayStation 2, Pro

774
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:30,360
Evolution Soccer 6 on DS, Star Fox Command on DS, World Snooker, it says Snooker, Championship

775
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:39,280
2007 on PSP by Sega, SOCOM US Navy Seals combined assault on PlayStation 2, and SOCOM US Navy

776
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:47,920
Seals Fire Team Bravo 2 on PSP, and Wild Arms XF, those last three are all on the 27th,

777
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,960
and Wild Arms XF is pretty cool.

778
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,280
So those are coming out.

779
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,280
Very cool.

780
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,200
You know, speaking of UK, you know our opening story, the controversial one this evening,

781
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,820
you know how I knew that was big news?

782
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:08,940
When I saw it on BBC News, that's when I was like, wow, if you didn't know about the don't

783
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,920
drink water and don't go to the bathroom thing before, you sure as hell will now, everybody

784
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
in the world will know it.

785
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,440
It's something else, especially when people are making jokes about it, and they can't

786
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,980
revert back to that story, got to move on to dates, because the folks in Japan want

787
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,080
to know what's coming out over there.

788
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,820
Even if you don't live in Japan, certainly the things that come out in Japan typically

789
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,440
will come out here a little later, or sometimes vice versa when the title came out in America

790
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,980
first, such as The Godfather, which is now making its way over to Japan on Xbox 360 on

791
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:47,420
January 25th, also coming out The Idolmaster on 360, and Vampire's Reign from AQ Interactive,

792
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:53,380
another title getting localized for Japan from its US release, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw,

793
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,080
coming out from THQ this week in Japan.

794
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,920
Over on PlayStation 3, Enchanted Arms, or as they call it in Japan, Enchant Arm, coming

795
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,500
out January 25th, so it should be interesting to see how that compares to the 360 version.

796
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,820
We'll hear a little more about that this week.

797
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:12,520
Also moving on to the Nintendo Wii, there's a Mahjong title, Mahjong Takai Wii, coming

798
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,540
out from Koei Entertainment on the 25th in Japan.

799
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:22,700
Over on the PlayStation 2, you get Final Fantasy X International and Final Fantasy X-2 International

800
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:27,420
moving into the Ultimate Hits, that just basically means they get a little bit cheaper.

801
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,940
But a big, big title, maybe not so much in Japan as it was here, but Grand Theft Auto

802
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,700
San Andreas is coming out.

803
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,500
I thought this was interesting from Capcom over in Japan, so it's kind of interesting

804
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:43,700
how things kind of shift around to get releases other places, because that happens sometimes.

805
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:51,100
Capcom also releasing Hyper Street Fighter II, the anniversary collection, and also another

806
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,500
big, big title coming out for folks who listen to this program I know for a long time, Dance

807
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:02,740
Dance Revolution Supernova finally getting its Japanese release on the 25th of January.

808
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:08,120
And also coming out for the PS2, its own version of SmackDown vs. Raw, and I like this title.

809
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:13,660
For Marvelous Entertainment, you're getting Kuji Biki Ambulance coming out.

810
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:21,180
Also a Naruto title, Naruto Team at Hero 3 moves into the best collection, because Naruto

811
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,180
titles, I guess, sell like crazy.

812
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,740
I don't know, I've never played one.

813
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:30,140
On the Nintendo DS, Biohazard Deadly Silence moves into the best price, which, sorry, Deadly

814
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,740
Silence, did I say Death Science?

815
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,820
Biohazard, of course, is Resident Evil.

816
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:40,940
And P-Cross DS comes out from Nintendo itself over on the Nintendo DS, also another game

817
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,340
coming out from Nintendo.

818
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:48,140
Wish Room, Tenshi no Kyoku, coming out this week in Japan.

819
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,340
Is that just the hotel game localized over there?

820
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,340
Oh, great.

821
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,620
And this is pretty cool, Dark Soccer, you'll like this.

822
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:58,340
Coming out on the PSP, Parodius Portable makes its way to the PSP.

823
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,580
I know you're a big fan of Parodius.

824
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,340
That was like, wasn't that the Parodius collection or something?

825
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,460
I believe it is.

826
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,460
I believe it is.

827
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,460
I love Parodius!

828
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,460
Oh, it's interesting.

829
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,180
Well, yeah, and also the Salamander collection, Salamander Portable is coming out this week

830
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,180
as well.

831
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,660
We're just talking about Salamander and Life Force 2 this morning.

832
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,660
And Gradius moves into the best, so a big week if you're a Gradius fan over in Japan.

833
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,300
So while it may be a slow week here in the U.S. and U.K., it's a busy week over there

834
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,300
in Japan.

835
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:29,500
I'd like to mention, though, this week they did announce, or it was on all the other sites

836
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,820
out there, that Driver was making its way to the Wii.

837
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,820
I just thought that was funny as well.

838
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,420
And that's what you had mentioned here on this program about five weeks ago, right?

839
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,420
Yeah, something like that.

840
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,420
I'm just curious.

841
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,540
You know, we do report a lot of these dates and no one seems to pick up onto it until

842
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,420
there is an official press release, so I told you so.

843
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,420
Shadow Charlie seems to enjoy Parodius as well.

844
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,380
Parodius has some badass music, says Shadow Charlie.

845
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,380
And Shadow Charlie also wants to know, is DDR Universe out yet?

846
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,900
And the answer is no.

847
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,840
So those that were thinking it's coming out in January, looks like it really was March.

848
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,940
After all, Loki wins again.

849
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:12,180
Well, we have a little bit more news as far as things that are going to be playable this

850
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,180
year.

851
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,940
The Final Fantasy XIII demo is due out.

852
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:21,420
They said ready for E3 in 2007.

853
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:26,900
I'm not sure which one I guess they mean, because given that there's multiple Final

854
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:34,980
Fantasy XIIIs going on, two of them going on with Squeenix, I'm not sure if they mean

855
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,940
both or just one or the other of them.

856
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,300
They should do 13 versions of that, you know, that would make sense.

857
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,300
They probably will eventually.

858
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,300
That would make me cry.

859
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,260
We've already got, what, 13 versions of Final Fantasy VII, practically.

860
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,620
I don't even feel like counting.

861
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:54,740
Or 13 versions of Final Fantasy I, as we're going to find out later in the program.

862
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,700
But at any rate, the two are going to...

863
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:05,420
I love Latin, fabula nova crystallis, that just sounds cool, the new tale of the crystal.

864
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,220
Pretty cool.

865
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:12,180
Kind of interesting, especially when folks are saying that the PlayStation 3 really needs

866
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,140
like its big title right now.

867
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,060
So it's kind of interesting how this Final Fantasy XIII news is kind of slowly leaking

868
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,060
out, right?

869
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,580
Well, you know what they need?

870
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,500
It's just like Final Fantasy VII for the PlayStation.

871
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,780
I mean, hell, I bought that system for that game.

872
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,780
That's true.

873
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,580
I did not buy a PlayStation until Final Fantasy VII.

874
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:31,860
And you know what, I have to admit, Final Fantasy XIII, especially depending on this

875
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,420
demo after I play the demo, will probably be the thing that finally breaks me to get

876
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,420
a PlayStation 3.

877
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,020
Because I'm the only OLR host that doesn't own one.

878
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,420
But I'm poor.

879
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,820
Anyways, so more on Final Fantasy XIII.

880
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:49,420
It's been leaked out by Famitsu and Dengeki.

881
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:55,100
Some stuff they're talking about, I guess, from the playable demo, including apparently

882
00:44:55,100 --> 00:45:00,540
it's going to have a really awesome opening scene that says probably the most intense

883
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:05,940
in the Final Fantasy series, which seems to be like every other game does that.

884
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,820
And then, of course, they were talking about, I guess, one of the main characters, the blonde

885
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,260
guy that you see in all the trailers.

886
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,500
Apparently it's going to be pretty big.

887
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,860
He's going to be large enough to run around carrying two people.

888
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,780
And they said his shoe size will be 33 centimeters.

889
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,020
I wonder what the fuck that's supposed to mean.

890
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,740
Who gives a shit about fictional characters' shoe sizes?

891
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,820
I guess that means his penis is going to be huge too.

892
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,820
But whatever.

893
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:35,740
So hopefully we'll get some more important information on Final Fantasy XIII coming soon,

894
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,220
other than shoe sizes.

895
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,220
We need bust sizes.

896
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,220
That's what we need.

897
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,220
Where's that information?

898
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:45,820
Well, I'm definitely looking forward to more and more information on Final Fantasy XIII.

899
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:51,900
Being the self-confessed Final Fantasy fanboy I am, I'm personally very excited for all

900
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,900
the latest.

901
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,040
We'll see hopefully more in the next few weeks.

902
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,980
More things that Japan is seeing is apparently PlayStation 3.

903
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,740
Sony put out a release this week that says they have sold one million of the machines.

904
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,740
I'm sorry.

905
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,740
I'm sorry.

906
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,740
Wait.

907
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,740
Key difference here.

908
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,740
They have shipped one million machines in Japan.

909
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,740
Sorry there.

910
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,740
I'm so tired of these.

911
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,740
See, I almost fell for the trick there.

912
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,740
That's what they're trying to get you to think.

913
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,700
I am so tired of these fucking companies doing this shit.

914
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,220
Oh, we've shipped them.

915
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,220
Good for you.

916
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,220
I've taken a shit too.

917
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,980
I mean, do you want news on that too?

918
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,740
I mean, seriously, so you shipped that many.

919
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,980
Why don't they say they've manufactured that many or thought about manufacturing that many?

920
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:33,860
It should be interesting to note that Sony only actually sold about 470,000 at the end

921
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:34,860
of 2006.

922
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,340
That was their year's end sale figure.

923
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,780
So it's kind of interesting that this release comes out now and says, oh, we've actually

924
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,220
shipped a million.

925
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:45,860
So does that mean that half of them are sitting on shelves?

926
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,300
They're shitting on the seashore.

927
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:51,060
I've got dyslexia of the mouth today.

928
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,060
I don't know what it is.

929
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,780
I'm combining words that don't need to be combined.

930
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,900
I don't know what's wrong today.

931
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,900
I apologize, folks.

932
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,940
Amateur radio at its finest.

933
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,460
Maybe this is why we don't get paid to do what we do.

934
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:11,180
Should you have a half a million of them sitting on the store shelves or have they moved a

935
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,540
whole bunch in the last two weeks that they've now shipped more to compensate for that?

936
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,540
I don't really know.

937
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,540
You have to understand.

938
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:22,620
They've moved more units to the stores to allow for more elaborate towers to be made

939
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:30,820
out of the units that no one's buying, including castles and the traditional Christmas tree

940
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,460
tower type thing.

941
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,260
It should be noted that now they have achieved their goal of shipping two million units worldwide

942
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:43,700
about two weeks late from the deadline, but keep in mind that was a goal that got smaller

943
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,020
and smaller before the PS3's release.

944
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,420
Wasn't there gold to sell that many units?

945
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,700
I don't know.

946
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,460
So now they're saying six million at the end of March they will ship.

947
00:47:53,460 --> 00:48:00,060
I'm glad to see that they were able to hit their twice-adjusted goal two weeks late.

948
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,060
Way to go, Sony.

949
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,260
Hey, look, I don't write it.

950
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,260
I just report on it.

951
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,380
There you go.

952
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,180
I don't know what else to tell you.

953
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,540
I know what else to tell people.

954
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,540
What's that?

955
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:16,220
Apparently, it's been listed that the PlayStation 3 is going to be more expensive in Ireland,

956
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,340
and I don't know why.

957
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:26,620
It was actually listed on This Is Living that the price of the PlayStation 3 in Ireland

958
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:36,100
is going to be 629.99 euros instead of the announced stuff, 5.99.

959
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:45,580
The speculation is that it actually is going to be an increase all over Europe, but just

960
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,180
that Ireland got the update first.

961
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:54,820
I really hope that it's not true, that they keep it the 5.99 because that's going to piss

962
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,060
off a lot of people.

963
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:00,420
I heard it was because of the higher VAT prices in Ireland.

964
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,180
Now Seisha is one of our UK listeners, and he's in chat right now saying it's not just

965
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,300
Ireland but the entirety of the UK as well.

966
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:20,820
Has Sony even officially confirmed anything?

967
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,540
We still don't have a firm date for the UK, do we?

968
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:28,180
They've confirmed non-confirmation.

969
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,700
So does this mean we don't really know anything, or what's it boiled down to?

970
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:37,820
It means that they're shipping units some day, some amount.

971
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:42,460
Actually, there is a posted update.

972
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,740
That's exactly why it did increase.

973
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:53,580
For the rest of everybody else, it's going to be 5.99 for the 60 and 4.25 for the...

974
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,660
Damn you Ireland, setting the bar for everyone else.

975
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,300
Just buy the 20.

976
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,300
You really don't need the 60.

977
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,300
Really?

978
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,300
I have the 60.

979
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,300
It's on HDMI.

980
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,140
So is HDMI that important, what do you guys think?

981
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,780
It's on both units.

982
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,260
I thought that was a big thing, that it wasn't going to be on the 20 gig.

983
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,540
Yeah, then they changed that.

984
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,540
Really?

985
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,540
Yeah, it's on both units.

986
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:14,540
I didn't get that memo.

987
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,540
Oh, it's still stupid.

988
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,540
I have the 60 and I like it.

989
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,540
Oh, we'll see.

990
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,540
I don't know.

991
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,420
I'm running out of room on the 360 with the 20 gig, so maybe I want...

992
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,420
Well, you can always upgrade, remember?

993
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,420
Nah, we'll see.

994
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,420
I don't know.

995
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:29,380
Of course, those hard drives, the two and a half inch SATA drives are fucking expensive,

996
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,380
but whatever.

997
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,380
I have no decision on what I want to do yet.

998
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,380
I'm too poor.

999
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,380
I know that much.

1000
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:38,740
But you know, one reason you might want to upgrade that 2.5 inch SATA drive in your PS3

1001
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:44,500
is to run MythTV on it, because if you install the second operating system or Linux on your

1002
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:50,060
other partition, there is actually a way now to get MythTV to run.

1003
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:58,120
Using a USB TV tuner and a wonderful set of homemade drivers for it, you too can run the

1004
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:04,580
wonderful TVR software to be able to record your favorite shows and dump them onto your

1005
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:09,340
hopefully larger hard drive, so that's pretty cool.

1006
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,780
And I don't know.

1007
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:15,780
I might try that, since I don't really have room on my other drive, although I need to

1008
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:20,100
get a capture card for that, but hey, that's great.

1009
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:26,300
Well, from one TV-enabled system to another, let's go over to Microsoft IPTV.

1010
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,740
Of course, this was announced at CES, and details are starting to fill in.

1011
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:36,500
I have a lengthy quote here from the Microsoft TV site of what exactly this thing does.

1012
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:41,700
Quote, Microsoft IPTV edition is an integrated and comprehensive software platform developed

1013
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:46,020
specifically to deliver broadcast quality video and new integrated TV services over

1014
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,420
broadband networks.

1015
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:52,340
The platform combines market-leading features such as instant channel change, ICC, and multiple

1016
00:51:52,340 --> 00:52:00,020
picture-in-picture with traditional TV services such as broadcast, programming, VOD, and DVR.

1017
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:04,660
The software is developed to integrate seamlessly and economically with other IP-based communications

1018
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:08,900
and media services for PCs, phones, and other consumer devices.

1019
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:14,580
Microsoft IPTV edition is ideal for telecommunications carriers and for cable operators looking to

1020
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:18,560
deliver differentiated TV services and experiences.

1021
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,740
And for what I've been picking else out there on the Internet, it does sound like if you

1022
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:26,300
want to have this, this is not just something you're going to simply download it or just

1023
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,620
plug on to your Xbox 360 and boom, you get TV through your 360.

1024
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,620
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1025
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:36,020
You're going to have to switch up your cable provider who therefore will also provide your

1026
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,660
Internet and so on and so on.

1027
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:42,780
You're really going to have to make an adjustment change when it comes to how your services

1028
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:47,580
such as Internet and TV are provided in your house.

1029
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:51,740
If people are thinking, oh, this is just some cool little enhancement of 360, it's a little

1030
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,340
more than that.

1031
00:52:53,340 --> 00:53:00,200
It kind of makes me think almost like Microsoft is now becoming like a rival to satellite

1032
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
in a way.

1033
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,200
I don't know.

1034
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,200
Maybe that's a little bit far-fetched.

1035
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,200
It's not the best way to phrase it.

1036
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,200
I don't know.

1037
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,200
What do you guys think?

1038
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,200
Is this something you might be interested in checking out?

1039
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,940
I want to check it out, definitely.

1040
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:09,940
Would you make that change?

1041
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,940
Would you get rid of what you have now for this?

1042
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,940
What I have?

1043
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,940
Yeah.

1044
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,060
Cable is fucking too expensive.

1045
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:18,300
If it had some good programming on it, hell yeah.

1046
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,700
If it had everything, although I imagine IPTV doesn't probably have everything, yeah, it

1047
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,580
might have some specific channels.

1048
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:34,420
If anything, it would be a good addition to if not replacing my current TV, although my

1049
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,740
current TV is expensive and I hate it.

1050
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:41,340
I'm looking at some comments from Chat Room, chat.orangelunge.com.

1051
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,260
Black Boy says, basically the 360 becomes a cable box.

1052
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,540
I guess that's one way you can think of it.

1053
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:51,580
I think it's a waste.

1054
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:55,140
This is Microsoft doing the Trojan horse thing and they've openly admitted that they did

1055
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:02,000
not put out the 360 to do just gaming and now it sounds to me like cable versus satellite

1056
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,580
versus the 360.

1057
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:09,220
Or you can do what I do and that's not watch TV and get a life.

1058
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,460
You watch Doctor Who.

1059
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:15,100
I download it off the internet, watch it at my convenience and then go outside.

1060
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,460
So there is some television you watch, at least one thing.

1061
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,460
But I don't use my television.

1062
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,500
And Torchwood, you watch that too.

1063
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,380
I don't need cable.

1064
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:26,180
But with the IPTV, granted you don't live in the UK, if there were any U.S. shows that

1065
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,980
you watched, I know they re-brought Heroes tomorrow.

1066
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,980
At all worth watching on television in the United States.

1067
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,420
Are you going to watch Heroes tomorrow with Doctor Nine?

1068
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,420
Probably not actually.

1069
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,340
I'm going to be in school.

1070
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,340
Let me down.

1071
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:43,020
I'll watch the other episodes and then watch that at my own convenience.

1072
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,020
All right.

1073
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,020
All right, whatever.

1074
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,380
There's no way we move over.

1075
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:54,300
The thing is I don't see why people are so obsessed with television anyway.

1076
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,700
People get obsessed over movies.

1077
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,620
Silent Hill, Jamie.

1078
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:02,180
I saw it four times and then they saw it.

1079
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,820
So it's just another type of entertainment.

1080
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:07,020
It was another thing that was at my convenience.

1081
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:12,380
I think if I got anything for TV, I'd definitely have a DVR, but other than that.

1082
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,660
And then that's kind of what IPTV is, DVR, video on demand, all that crap.

1083
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:22,300
I just don't think that we need anything else contributing to the couch potato mentality.

1084
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,540
But there are educational things on TV.

1085
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,640
Heck, over at Loki's last night we were watching on Discovery Health, this whole special on

1086
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,900
people going through transgender surgery.

1087
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:34,460
And there was this post-op chick who was walking around with a shirt off on the beach, looked

1088
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,700
just like a dude.

1089
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,020
Very educational.

1090
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,020
Very educational.

1091
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:41,860
There's also make YouTube that has all that on it too.

1092
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,740
And I can go to school.

1093
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,540
Something else I wanted to mention.

1094
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,620
Somebody was saying they weren't interested.

1095
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:52,420
JV Mon in chat says, IPTV seems unattractive to me.

1096
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,900
I feel like I don't know enough about it yet.

1097
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,620
I realize CES is kind of a very high level thing for tech heads and things of that nature.

1098
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:03,140
I need a brochure that's dumbed down for me to explain exactly what I'm going to have

1099
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:07,540
to change and what I'm going to have to pay to get this and why I should do it.

1100
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,260
But again, for me it comes down to channels.

1101
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:14,320
If it had some pretty good HD channels, because that's what my current cable provider is severely

1102
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,260
lacking is we have like five HD channels and there's way more out there.

1103
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,900
I know there's others out there and HD is pretty.

1104
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,020
Raven's Dolphin agrees with the YouTube thing.

1105
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,020
Long live YouTube.

1106
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,300
There you go.

1107
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:39,700
Moving on, we watched YouTube last night on the Wii and laser cats.

1108
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:43,860
We were watching Jesus Christ Super Cop today on the Wii.

1109
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:48,380
They were watching some spider video where somebody dubbed over one of those Discovery

1110
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:52,540
Channel things on spiders and made it sound like one spider got a restraining order on

1111
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,540
the other.

1112
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,540
I don't know.

1113
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,540
I only watched like five minutes.

1114
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,540
What happens when spiders are on drugs?

1115
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,540
So how about some Halo?

1116
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,540
Yeah, how about some Halo?

1117
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:02,540
They have actually released some details about the assault rifle, which I guess some people

1118
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,860
care about.

1119
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:14,420
The assault rifle in Halo 3 is the MA-5C assault rifle that is a return of one that they removed

1120
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:15,420
from Halo 2.

1121
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,780
They didn't have any Halo 2.

1122
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:22,300
The power level is going to be somewhere between the original one and the BR-55 battle rifle

1123
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,940
from Halo 2.

1124
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,900
You can use the butt as a melee weapon apart from that.

1125
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:32,220
Just the thing that I thought was very funny is how they described it was the MA-5C is

1126
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,300
built like a breakout house with Venetian blinds.

1127
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,820
That just made me laugh.

1128
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:40,020
Are you going to play some Halo 3 Dark Sakura?

1129
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,020
No, get motion sick.

1130
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,700
But you get to blow stuff up?

1131
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,460
Yeah, I can play Bomberman.

1132
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,460
I don't know.

1133
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:54,280
The thing is that I really don't have to play these games because Dan plays them and I could

1134
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,940
go read a book and hear the explosions while I'm reading my book.

1135
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,340
I get the best of both worlds.

1136
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:07,460
Sometimes I wonder why you're on this program, but then I remember there are those cutesy

1137
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:14,740
games that you are into that none of the rest of us have heard of, so I guess there's that.

1138
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,300
The Halo franchise really isn't that bad.

1139
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:21,820
It's just that it's not my thing.

1140
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:26,180
That's understandable because I know a lot of people who aren't into Halo, but me?

1141
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,580
I've been getting back into Halo 2 lately.

1142
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,980
I did try.

1143
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:35,940
If somebody I know is into a game, I think that it's worth playing once before I reserve

1144
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:40,680
my judgment for it, but I have the same problem with that that I found out a long time ago

1145
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:45,260
that I have with Goldeneye with almost any first person shooter.

1146
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,660
It makes me so motion sick that I can't.

1147
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,380
Katamari makes me motion sick.

1148
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:55,020
However, it's on crack and has enough in it that makes me be able to stand playing a couple

1149
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,020
of games.

1150
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:03,460
Can you imagine how insane Katamari would be if the Sonic team was behind it?

1151
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,620
That would be super fast.

1152
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,260
No, because they'd fuck it up.

1153
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,260
Oh, that's right.

1154
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:09,700
You wouldn't be able to control it correctly.

1155
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,700
Exactly.

1156
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,700
No, no, no, no.

1157
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:17,140
I think the Sonic team debate will go for another show.

1158
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:23,340
Anywho, as if it's a huge surprise or anything, because I know it's not for me.

1159
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:28,140
The Halo 3 beta, since it's being included in Crackdown, well, they've sold about another

1160
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:31,500
25% more of Crackdown than they would have normally had.

1161
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,580
Yeah, big surprise there.

1162
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:37,220
People aren't going to buy Crackdown just because of the Halo 3 beta in there.

1163
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,780
To be honest though, Crackdown's an awesome game.

1164
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:43,620
The demo's coming out on Tuesday, so I highly recommend checking it out if you have Xbox

1165
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:49,100
Live, definitely worth it.

1166
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:54,420
As Loki previously reported, Major Nelson confirmed that Crackdown demo will be hitting

1167
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:59,220
Xbox Live on Tuesday, and Loki gets a big finger from me for stealing my story.

1168
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,440
Thanks a lot.

1169
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,220
Check it out, Tuesday at 2 o'clock Pacific Time.

1170
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:07,180
But I guess I could take this opportunity to point out, he doesn't often announce demos

1171
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:12,320
in advance, so usually they announce them once they've already hit or news leaks out

1172
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:17,220
and most Microsoft rumors are true anyway, so I don't know.

1173
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:20,980
But regardless, since I don't know much about Crackdown, but I keep hearing Loki rave about

1174
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:24,300
it, which is fascinating because he's never played it, I definitely want to check out

1175
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,300
the demo.

1176
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:28,540
It's like Grand Theft Auto, but okay, here's why Crackdown's awesome.

1177
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:33,020
It's like Grand Theft Auto, but you're like a super-powered hero guy, and basically you

1178
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:37,580
can, for example, kill somebody, throw them in the air, fire rockets, and juggle them

1179
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,900
off the rockets in the air.

1180
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,300
You can get achievements for that, by the way.

1181
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:45,660
You can jump from buildings, you know, building to building, you can throw cars at people.

1182
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:49,500
When you get into a car, it becomes like the super-charged Batmobile type thing.

1183
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,020
Can you sleep with a hooker, then shoot them?

1184
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,460
I don't know if you can sleep with hookers.

1185
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,460
Not interested.

1186
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:57,260
But you can probably throw hookers in the buildings, and that's just as cool.

1187
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:00,260
Okay, now my interest is back, we'll see.

1188
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,700
It's got two-player co-op over live.

1189
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,700
Okay, alright.

1190
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,700
See, that would be fun.

1191
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,860
I will check out the demo just for you, Loki, and give my thoughts on next week's edition.

1192
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,380
We'll play multiplayer.

1193
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,660
Alright, will the demo have multiplayer?

1194
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,660
Yes.

1195
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,660
Oh, sweet!

1196
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:15,660
I'm all about that.

1197
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:16,660
Can I throw you into a building?

1198
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,980
Because I've been wanting to do that for a long time.

1199
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:18,980
Maybe.

1200
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:19,980
Alright!

1201
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:20,980
Sign me up!

1202
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:21,980
I should pre-order it tomorrow.

1203
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:26,220
Then I can be in the Halo 3 beta, like all the cool kids.

1204
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,900
You can be in the cool kids club for lots of other things, Rob.

1205
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:30,900
Like what?

1206
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:37,360
Um, like your idea for getting fast passes while we were in the line for Space Mountain.

1207
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,360
So we could ride it again?

1208
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,360
Yeah, I know.

1209
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,220
And then getting fast passes for when we go back for my birthday.

1210
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:43,220
I'm smart.

1211
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,220
I'm smart like that.

1212
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:47,820
Well, here's some cool stuff.

1213
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:59,180
For anyone who is into Luminous Live, there will be three goodies coming out on Wednesday.

1214
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:03,520
It's actually three downloadable packages that are going to be available January 24th

1215
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,820
at 1 a.m. Pacific time.

1216
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:15,260
Two of them are add-on packs, and then there's one for free, but only for Xbox Live Gold

1217
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:16,260
members.

1218
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,780
That would be the Heavenly Star pack.

1219
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:23,060
Yes, which I am so, you know, I would get Luminous Live just to get the Heavenly Star

1220
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:24,060
pack.

1221
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:28,580
Yes, and this gives me another excuse to play this song on our little program here, a little

1222
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:31,620
clip from it, because I freaking love this song, and I think it's going to be awesome

1223
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,620
to play.

1224
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,620
That's what I called it.

1225
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:34,620
I put it on my Micey.

1226
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:45,940
Oh, somebody in chat is saying there's new...

1227
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:49,460
Alpha Canagram says, I want the new Genki Rockets remixes on iTunes.

1228
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,460
What?

1229
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,460
What?

1230
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:52,460
I have iTunes open right now.

1231
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:53,460
I'm going to look at that crap.

1232
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,460
Rob, show.

1233
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:56,180
I do not see remixes on iTunes.

1234
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:57,180
This is lies.

1235
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,180
Lies.

1236
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:00,180
Maybe they're in the UK store or something.

1237
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,180
Show.

1238
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,180
I don't know.

1239
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:05,980
I do want to go back and read some chat comments, some other things in chat.

1240
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:09,940
Jeremy Todd 1 was saying about the Crackdown demo, Loki, some people who have played it

1241
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:14,380
were saying it's more like Spiderman 2 or that Hulk Ultimate Destruction game more than

1242
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:16,900
GTA.

1243
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,460
And Blaze says, this is how the demo is going to go down.

1244
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,180
Loki kills everything, Rob goes and picks a flower.

1245
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,060
Look, screw you, buddy, okay?

1246
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:25,060
Look, no.

1247
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,060
No.

1248
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:29,460
When I played the Superman Returns demo, which the only thing I got a thrill out of in that

1249
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:33,860
demo was I went and I picked up a woman and then I flew to the beach and left her and

1250
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:34,860
I was like, bye, bitch.

1251
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:35,860
I flew away.

1252
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:36,860
My favorite was that.

1253
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:40,700
If you don't think I can be sadistic in those types of games, you are way wrong.

1254
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,340
You got the wrong impression of me, buddy.

1255
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:43,780
You missed the best part in the game, though.

1256
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:48,340
You pick up a car and you fly really high because you can't really blow up the car.

1257
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:51,740
You could drop the car, though, and then it just falls and explodes.

1258
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:52,740
Really?

1259
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,420
I should re-download the demo just to do that.

1260
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,420
It's hilarious.

1261
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:56,420
I'm not going to buy the game.

1262
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:00,460
Do you get achievements, maybe, for that because maybe I could gamefly it or something.

1263
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:01,460
I need to get a gamefly account.

1264
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,460
It's one of those companies.

1265
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,460
I don't know if I'll go with them.

1266
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:08,180
It's a horrible, horrible game, but anyways, one game that's not so horrible, although

1267
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:13,340
some people may think it's horrible, is this game called Boom Boom Rocket, which is being

1268
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:16,460
put out by Bazaar.

1269
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:23,060
It resembles very closely Phantom Vision and actually almost looks like kind of DDR across

1270
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,060
with Phantom Vision.

1271
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:27,300
I'm not sure how you would play the game.

1272
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,300
I don't know.

1273
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,300
It looks pretty awesome.

1274
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:35,220
You basically will be blowing up fireworks to time with ten original tracks that they're

1275
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:36,220
going to be having.

1276
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:42,020
It's going to be published by EA and hopefully it will be downloadable soon.

1277
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,020
So I don't know.

1278
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:46,820
It looks pretty cool from the screenshots I've seen of it so far.

1279
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,820
It looks pretty sexy.

1280
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:48,820
I don't know.

1281
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:51,220
I heard it just looks like Phantom Vision.

1282
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,340
Oh, there's actual screenshots of it now?

1283
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:56,100
It looks just like Phantom Vision and kind of like DDR.

1284
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,300
Oh, it does look kind of like DDR.

1285
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,540
Oh, Jamie can't see.

1286
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:01,100
Oh, that looks fun.

1287
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,100
Show it to Jamie.

1288
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,100
She can't see.

1289
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,100
Ooh, explodey.

1290
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,100
Oh, Miklotov's excited about this?

1291
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,300
I love Phantom Vision.

1292
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:11,140
I think I'm the only person in the world who got the biggest kick out of it.

1293
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,140
I still have Phantom Vision.

1294
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:13,140
It's the best.

1295
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:17,260
It was the best launch title and that looks just like it and I can't wait now.

1296
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:21,060
It really does look like DDR because there's like this kind of a purple line towards the

1297
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:27,940
top of the screen and there's actual looks like the, you know, bursts from the fireworks

1298
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,820
going up instead of you maybe clicking on them or whatever.

1299
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:36,500
They have arrows on them so I think you have to maybe point in the direction of the arrow

1300
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:40,380
or something like kind of like DDR and it'll blow them up in time.

1301
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:41,380
That's my guess.

1302
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:42,380
JV Monn called it.

1303
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:45,140
JV Monn said, that will make Miklotov happy.

1304
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:48,100
You must talk to him a lot offline or something.

1305
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,100
All right.

1306
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,100
Before we get to the next story, I just want to point this out.

1307
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:54,980
I wanted to do a quick follow up here on the last story.

1308
01:05:54,980 --> 01:06:00,540
What I thought was interesting is that somebody pointed me to the MySpace for Genkai Rockets

1309
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:05,820
who does Heavenly Star and apparently it is announced on there that there will be five

1310
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:09,180
different remixes of Heavenly Star coming soon and they have a clip.

1311
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,180
I'm assuming this is one of them.

1312
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:31,100
Ah, forget it, that's just some clip from the radio.

1313
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,540
Why did they put that on their MySpace?

1314
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:36,840
Live radio boys and girls, sorry, I didn't know what I was clicking on but they do say

1315
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:42,660
on the MySpace it's written here, five different remixes of Heavenly Star coming soon.

1316
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:48,700
Why would they put that clip from a radio show because they want to show that Genkai

1317
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,700
Rockets is awesome?

1318
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:54,620
Why don't they put an MP3 copy of it or something, something that doesn't sound like recorded

1319
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:55,620
off radio?

1320
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:58,260
Do you think we could get Genkai Rockets on the show?

1321
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:01,300
Do you think they speak English?

1322
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,300
Maybe.

1323
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,540
I'm going to fire off an email.

1324
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,020
I'm going to send a message on MySpace.

1325
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,020
They sing in English.

1326
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,020
We'll see what happens.

1327
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:09,380
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1328
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:16,380
Well anyway, speaking of popular music games such as Fantavision and this Boom Boom Rocket

1329
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:22,040
thing coming up, one very uber popular music game folks have been following is Guitar Hero.

1330
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:28,740
We got a lot of Guitar Hero news for you guys tonight and this story is very interesting.

1331
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:33,020
Apparently what's happening now that Activision has acquired Red Octane which happened some

1332
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:36,780
time ago, apparently what's happening is that the Guitar Hero franchise is now moving over

1333
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:43,500
to the Neversoft branch who makes Tony Hawk's Project 8 and this is confirmed by a screenshot

1334
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:47,740
from Neversoft's website where you see Guitar Hero side by side with Tony Hawk's Project

1335
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:48,740
8.

1336
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:54,140
So it does look like now Guitar Hero 3 will be developed by this Neversoft company.

1337
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:58,980
Apparently now this frees up harmonics to work on a rumored sequel to Frequency and

1338
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:03,500
Amplitude but as we learned about on a previous program, they were going to put one out on

1339
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:07,220
the PSP and it got, I guess, canned.

1340
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,580
So I don't know what they're working on now.

1341
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:09,580
Must be top secret.

1342
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:10,580
Who knows?

1343
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:18,620
Well, there is actually something interesting going on though.

1344
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:25,740
Activision registered trademarks for two new games, Guitar Villain and Drum Villain.

1345
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:30,340
The applications are stating that they're both the same thing, computer game software,

1346
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:39,020
downloadable software for use in connection with computer games, entertainment services.

1347
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:45,660
It seems to me that I think that they're really going to be expanding the franchise.

1348
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:50,620
And both of those applications also said that they'd be using toy guitars for video games,

1349
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:56,220
toys designed to be used for computer games or video games.

1350
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,540
The drum one sounds interesting.

1351
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:03,620
I'm thinking sort of like what Session Mode was for Drum Mania but also we need to keep

1352
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:12,900
in mind in April last year Red Octane placed applications to trademark Drum Hero and Keyboard

1353
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:13,900
Hero.

1354
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:14,900
So...

1355
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,140
I haven't seen anything from those yet.

1356
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,980
No, but it could be...

1357
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:26,340
But it is interesting that Konami, who did the Bimani series, had a Guitar Freaks, Drum

1358
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,020
Mania, and Keyboard Mania.

1359
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:30,740
So it's almost kind of mirror image.

1360
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:31,740
That's all right.

1361
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:38,180
They'll win their awards for Drum Hero and Keyboard Hero and Band Hero and whatever else.

1362
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,180
It's so innovative.

1363
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:40,180
I've never seen that before.

1364
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:41,180
Ever.

1365
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:42,180
You know what?

1366
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:46,620
Konami abandoned Keyboard Mania, therefore I am all about bringing on the Keyboard Hero.

1367
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:47,620
That's fine.

1368
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:48,620
That's fine.

1369
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:49,620
It's fine.

1370
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:50,620
That's optional.

1371
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:57,980
If they can put jump in Keyboard Hero, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, tell me not everyone would want to play that.

1372
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:58,980
Van Halen.

1373
01:09:58,980 --> 01:09:59,980
Session Van Halen.

1374
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:00,980
That would be awesome.

1375
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:01,980
Hello?

1376
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:02,980
All right.

1377
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:03,980
Sorry.

1378
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,420
What the hell would they do with Guitar Villains anyway?

1379
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:08,060
Were there any Guitar Villains?

1380
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,800
Maybe be like Death Metal Edition.

1381
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,100
Whatever.

1382
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,140
I don't know.

1383
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:19,720
I just hope they don't really come out and try to say it's original.

1384
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:24,760
But what's good about music games though, the sales have been up about 80% probably

1385
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:29,900
due to the fact of Guitar Hero 2 coming out since it was one of the top selling games

1386
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:32,140
in December.

1387
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:37,100
Not a huge surprise, but a lot of people are starting to actually look at music games as

1388
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:46,060
possibly a way to get their music heard, including some quotes from former Jane's Addiction

1389
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:51,020
and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Dave Navarro, to be featured in a video game is probably

1390
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:57,700
the greatest way to reach a large audience right now.

1391
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:02,380
I'm not really surprised with good games like Guitar Hero 2 coming out, they're getting

1392
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:07,700
a lot more attention than say DDR, because DDR right now, not really that much innovation

1393
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,700
going on.

1394
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:15,620
I will say as much as I love and adore Konami for bringing over Beatmania and DDR, I think

1395
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:19,180
this kind of proves they didn't put enough faith in it in the beginning.

1396
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:23,340
Now that the games have taken off, other people are getting the credit for it in a way.

1397
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:28,720
Obviously the guitar game has been reinvented since then, but I think Konami might be kicking

1398
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,420
themselves a little bit for not taking a bigger risk and bringing more of those games over

1399
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:32,420
here a few years ago.

1400
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:37,620
You know, I'm really surprised that with Guitar Hero's success that they haven't jumped to

1401
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:39,540
try to bring drum here.

1402
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:45,300
Give it time, you never know what might happen.

1403
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,300
We will see I guess.

1404
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:50,540
Yeah, supposedly they're having a big press conference pretty soon, Konami, and apparently

1405
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:53,340
we get to go, so we'll have all the latest for you.

1406
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:54,340
Apparently.

1407
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:55,340
Hopefully.

1408
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:56,700
Hopefully we don't get turned down.

1409
01:11:56,700 --> 01:12:02,180
So we'll have all the latest for you guys here on this program when that happens, which

1410
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:04,840
is in a couple weeks.

1411
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:08,380
Talking now about the Wii a little bit, because you know one reason that people play dance

1412
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:13,420
games is to lose weight, and one thing that has people excited about the Wii is it's got

1413
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:17,500
you up and moving around, so can you really lose weight playing the Wii?

1414
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,420
And you know my kind of reaction when I saw it was like, well not a lot, you're not doing

1415
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,420
that much motion.

1416
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:25,660
You're not supposed to do these grand huge motions, you're only supposed to do little

1417
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:28,220
motions with your hand and all that stuff.

1418
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:34,940
This website did this Wii Sports experiment, and apparently what they've done here is that

1419
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:39,420
they did a 30 day trial of playing the game.

1420
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:45,260
They ran, I think they played for 30 days for 30 minutes, and the dude lost like 10

1421
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,260
pounds.

1422
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,260
Without changing any diet or anything.

1423
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,260
No, I'm sorry, it was six weeks.

1424
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:52,940
He didn't change any diet or nothing, and in 30 minutes of Wii Sports a day, he lost

1425
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,460
10 pounds.

1426
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:57,980
I would say that's just probably a result of being more active in general, just kind

1427
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:02,400
of getting the body moving and waking up the muscles and things, probably a little bit.

1428
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,540
That's probably it, I mean it's just an increase in activity.

1429
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:09,660
If anything I would consider a low impact aerobic.

1430
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:12,580
Yeah, it's better than nothing.

1431
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:15,260
So you know, cool on that.

1432
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:20,480
And that's probably something I need to go on because I've gained a little weight lately

1433
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,380
and I need to lose it, so maybe I'll go on the Wii diet as well.

1434
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:26,860
Because you know, WarioWare has kind of a mode in it that is encouraging the whole weight

1435
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:27,860
loss thing.

1436
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:33,640
They have a mode that is nothing but games that require big movements.

1437
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:36,540
So it's supposed to be a game that really gets you moving around, and I just need to

1438
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:37,540
play more DDR.

1439
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:38,540
You're just going to go to the gym.

1440
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,860
And I do need to just go to the gym, but you know my thing with gyms.

1441
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:42,860
Gyms are weird places.

1442
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:44,660
You can come with me and Extra for on Tuesday.

1443
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:45,660
I'll think about it.

1444
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,860
We'll talk off air.

1445
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:50,360
Maybe we'll have a play date, we'll see.

1446
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:54,620
Only if we get to, never mind.

1447
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,100
If we get to go out for ice cream afterwards.

1448
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,460
Okay, let's get ice cream after the gym.

1449
01:13:58,460 --> 01:13:59,460
That works for me.

1450
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,180
That's the kind of reward I need.

1451
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:06,060
All right, anyway, one reward we like to give our listeners is reading the stuff they have

1452
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,120
to write to us on air.

1453
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,860
And tonight we have our lovely mailbag segment.

1454
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:14,980
DarkSakura reads the emails that you send to her at mailbag.orangelaungerator.com live

1455
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:16,260
here on the air.

1456
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,700
And I believe we probably have an Uber mailbag segment tonight, don't we?

1457
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:19,700
We probably have a lot.

1458
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:20,700
Decent.

1459
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,540
Once I got rid of the spam, we had a few.

1460
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:24,540
All right.

1461
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,740
Well, let's get to some emails, because I know we probably missed a few while we were

1462
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:29,580
out and I want to hear what the folks had to say.

1463
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:33,180
So DarkSakura, who emailed us?

1464
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:35,300
First email of the night was from Rini.

1465
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,300
Salutations.

1466
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,020
I love when an email starts with salutations.

1467
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:40,020
That's just awesome.

1468
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:44,060
Okay, listen to your last two podcasts of 2006 and we'd like to respond to some items

1469
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,060
of interest.

1470
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:50,660
On your Christmas Eve episode, someone asked why iTunes keeps inexplicably stopping downloads.

1471
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:55,060
As much as it pisses me off as well, the only remedy I can offer to iTunes users when you're

1472
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:59,780
downloading a podcast, make sure that not only is iTunes in the front most or active

1473
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:05,180
application, but that you keep iTunes in its downloads feature up front as well.

1474
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:09,180
You do this by starting a download in iTunes, choosing downloads on the sidebar to the left

1475
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:10,660
of the iTunes window.

1476
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:11,660
Okay.

1477
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:15,580
And since iTunes is already being pissy enough as it is, if you end up with an incomplete

1478
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:19,820
podcast, delete the incomplete file, go on to the podcast section of iTunes and click

1479
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:24,500
on the Orange Dodge Radio item, the one with the gray iTunes window, click unsubscribe

1480
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,860
and then click subscribe.

1481
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:30,100
After you've recovered from doing all that, iTunes will have refreshed the list of all

1482
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,500
shows from the feed and immediately start downloading the latest show automatically.

1483
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,220
You know what's also great about that?

1484
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:39,580
The more people that click subscribe, the higher our ranking goes on iTunes.

1485
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:43,380
You're also inadvertently helping the station out, so I love this tactic.

1486
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,700
Kudos to Renee.

1487
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:49,540
Regarding your end of the year show, I would like to say that Scott Rubin was quite pissed

1488
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,220
that he wasn't invited.

1489
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,220
Rebuttal?

1490
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:56,020
He would have been a great guest.

1491
01:15:56,020 --> 01:16:03,020
You know, Scott, I left the message on Scott's Xbox Live friends list and he befriended me,

1492
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:04,020
so his loss.

1493
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:07,460
No, I'm just kidding.

1494
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:12,340
The reason we picked the people we did is we wanted to get a mix of people that we have

1495
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:18,180
on the show a lot like Bobby and people we hadn't had on the show before but respected

1496
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:23,860
like VGO and Gamertag Radio and those other things.

1497
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:28,360
Scott knows he's welcome on the show any time he wants, so Scott, if you're still feeling

1498
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,700
butthurt about not being on the show, send us an email, we'd love to have you on any

1499
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:32,700
time.

1500
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:37,060
Lastly, I don't believe it was reported on OLR, but the classic CD-ROM trivia game You

1501
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:41,660
Don't Know Jack semi-returns in web form at YouDon'tKnowJack.com.

1502
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:45,380
Currently questions only come in the form of Dis or Dat minigames.

1503
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:50,140
The best parts are that a new Dis or Dat is available daily holidays, too, and one of

1504
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:56,620
the original hosts, I mean, Cookie, is present.

1505
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:00,700
Curiously, the site is also in beta form.

1506
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,220
Have a happy new year and keep on going, Reenie.

1507
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:07,060
Uh, yeah, I looked at the You Don't Know Jack's website and played some of the Dis or Dat.

1508
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:09,500
Dude, it's free and it's You Don't Know Jack.

1509
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,500
Hello?

1510
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,420
Why aren't you playing?

1511
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:13,420
Go take a look.

1512
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,420
It's awesome.

1513
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:21,260
Um, anyway, uh, moving forward, um, we have one from AZHP.

1514
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:26,660
Hey, guys, you, um, all were talking about Ikaruga, Radiant Silver Gun, and the possibility

1515
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:29,620
of RS2 on 360.

1516
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:33,260
Just having gotten Ikaruga, um, as a Christmas present for my girlfriend, I wanted to know

1517
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:37,540
what other games has Treasure made, especially games that were on systems in the realm of

1518
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:39,060
virtual console games.

1519
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:43,980
I have my Wii and I'm an absolute, uh, VC game whore.

1520
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:48,660
Not because I played the games in my youth, I'm 18 and in college, but because my paltry

1521
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:53,100
$4 a week allowance didn't allow me to buy many $70 games in my youth.

1522
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:58,060
That being said, uh, virtual console is a haven for, uh, shrimp fans, as I have Gunstar

1523
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:02,940
Heroes, Superstar Soldiers, Soldier Blade, and R-Type and Love Them All, and I'm eagerly,

1524
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:07,740
um, anticipating downloading Gradius as soon as I load up more points.

1525
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:11,500
So basically, what Treasure games are there that could possibly make their way to virtual

1526
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,500
console?

1527
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:15,740
Eagerly waiting an answer, sincerely AZHP.

1528
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:23,540
And I actually emailed back with, um, a list, and, um, give me a second and I will definitely

1529
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:25,980
pull up the list that I did.

1530
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:30,500
Um, okay, here are the list of games that Treasure has made.

1531
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:36,700
Um, for Arcados, Ikaruga, Radiant Silver Gun, Dreamcastles, Bongayo, Ikaruga, Game Boy Advance

1532
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:41,580
was Advance Guardian Heroes, Astro Boy Omega Factor, Gunstar Super Heroes, Hajimino Ippo

1533
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:45,840
the Fighting, Tiny Toon Adventures, Buster's Bad Dream, I just totally don't see that coming

1534
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,540
out on virtual console.

1535
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:51,820
Game Boy Color was Tiny Toon Adventures, Dizzy's Candy Quest, Game Gear was Dynamite Headdy,

1536
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:57,060
Gunstar Heroes, GameCube was Dragon Drive, D Master Shot, Ikaruga, Wario World, Genesis,

1537
01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:01,340
Alien Soldier, Dynamite Headdy, Gunstar Heroes, Light Crusader, McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure,

1538
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:07,580
which I totally don't see coming on virtual console, and Yu Yu Hakusho, Makio, Toitsusen,

1539
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,500
sorry, um, and then I.Q.

1540
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:14,180
Sin and Punishment, Successor to the Earth, Master System had Dynamite Headdy, um, Nintendo

1541
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:18,780
64 was Baccarat, this is just a bunch that came out, basically Mission Makers, Bongayo,

1542
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:25,120
we had some Bleach games, um, Rakugaki Showtime, Silhouette Mirage, um, basically the games

1543
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:33,260
that I see coming out, um, I think that if they start expanding past, um, the 16-bit

1544
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:37,240
era, which I kind of hope that they do, we might start seeing some of the Saturn 2D ones

1545
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,820
out, I would love to see Radiant Silver Gun and Guardian Heroes and Silhouette Mirage

1546
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:41,820
coming out.

1547
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:52,780
The Saturn games on virtual console, huh, you really think we get Saturn games on virtual

1548
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:55,780
console?

1549
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:59,260
But I don't see why we wouldn't get some of the, the, the sprite-based ones.

1550
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:03,540
Maybe on, I'm gonna say it here and now, I bet you anything in the next three years Nintendo

1551
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:06,700
announces a Wii HD, maybe on the Wii HD.

1552
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:10,980
But I totally see us getting, um, like, something like Mischief Makers, um.

1553
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:17,460
I totally see, um, you know, Dynamite Heady, a bunch of the other ones coming out, I mean,

1554
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:22,620
I don't really see why not, if it's not, if it's not just for size, I think that it could

1555
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:24,660
definitely, um, handle it.

1556
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:29,420
Uh, GS68 makes a good point, soundtracks will raise the file size, because if it uses Red

1557
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:32,440
Book Audio, then that's- Why would it use Red Book Audio?

1558
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,440
Did they?

1559
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,440
I don't know.

1560
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,440
Didn't some Saturn games use it?

1561
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:40,540
Only some did, and then they started moving in toward, um, the other, eh, I can't remember

1562
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:41,540
off the top of my head.

1563
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:42,540
Okay.

1564
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:46,700
Some games, I mean, some games you can fully put in and just listen to, but they started

1565
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:49,860
moving away from that toward- Like, DDR Sekimex, I remember, was just randomly

1566
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:53,020
some game I'm thinking of off the top of my head, like, of the PlayStation DDR game?

1567
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,020
The first DDR, yeah.

1568
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:58,140
Yeah, you could, you could put it in a regular CD player and, and hear the songs, the soundtrack.

1569
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:59,140
Yeah.

1570
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:03,880
Um, a, a lot more games, uh, started moving past that, though, for, for compression.

1571
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:09,100
You know, I think that once, if they were able to get some sort of, you know, increased,

1572
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:14,220
you know, storage capability for the Wii, I think we could totally start seeing, um,

1573
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:18,860
other, uh, you know, later generation system games.

1574
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:19,860
I don't see why not.

1575
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:21,220
I think they could fully handle it.

1576
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:22,860
Well, we'll see.

1577
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,700
But- Not this year.

1578
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:29,100
I'm just glad to see that other people like Treasure, because I love Treasure.

1579
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:36,100
Um, also, um, next email, we have one coming from, um, Nike.

1580
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,780
Hey, OLR, I'm here again.

1581
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:41,220
Not quite a lot to say, but I'll try to keep it short.

1582
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,660
Hey, what's an MMO?

1583
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:44,860
Is it like a World of Warcraft style game?

1584
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:48,460
MMO is, uh, um, massively multiplayer online.

1585
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:52,820
Um, you mean MMORPG, massively multiplayer online roleplay game.

1586
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:56,220
MMO is, uh, massively multiplayer online.

1587
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:59,220
Which basically means you're playing with hundreds of people or thousands of people

1588
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:01,940
at once instead of just two or three, all online.

1589
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:02,940
You're all in, like, a world.

1590
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:05,020
They're usually world type games.

1591
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:10,740
Um, looking on the HMVUK website, they're saying they're selling Excite Truck for pre-order

1592
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:12,460
for February for £50.

1593
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,460
It's nearly $100 a disc.

1594
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:15,900
And Case and Some Paper.

1595
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:16,900
What a rip-off.

1596
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:17,900
Um, actually, no, it's really fun.

1597
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:21,140
Um- Yeah, but I- I wouldn't pay $100 for it.

1598
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:22,140
Sorry.

1599
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,820
Uh, see, what kind of music do you lot like?

1600
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:26,980
Um, Jamie mentioned ASH, which is number one of my favorites.

1601
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:31,700
Rob also mentioned the music from Elite Beat Agents, which has, uh, stuff like, uh, Sum

1602
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:32,700
41.

1603
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:35,500
Um, me, my favorite bands are Gorillaz and Pain.

1604
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:39,700
Oh, it's like actual bands or video game music?

1605
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:40,700
I'm just picking music.

1606
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:45,200
Because, like, when it comes to video game music, like, I love all the stuff that Mizuguchi

1607
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,200
is a part of.

1608
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:49,780
Like, you know, Space Channel 5 and- and Luminous and all that stuff is awesome.

1609
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:52,460
Um, and of course, Nobui Matsu.

1610
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:55,580
Uh, when it comes to real music, which I-

1611
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:57,580
Rob listens to trancy stuff.

1612
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:58,580
Eh, sometimes.

1613
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:00,140
It just depends on what I'm in the mood for.

1614
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,140
Um- And shoes.

1615
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:04,260
What if- what if I've been listening to a lot lately?

1616
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:05,260
I don't even know.

1617
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:07,340
Um- What's that, uh, Icelandic-

1618
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:08,340
What, Bjork?

1619
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:09,340
No.

1620
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:10,340
Uh, Roiksop.

1621
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:11,340
I like them.

1622
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,340
Yeah.

1623
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:13,340
They're cool.

1624
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:14,340
They're cool.

1625
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,340
I don't like them.

1626
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,340
I like Bjork, too, though.

1627
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:17,340
And I also like- I also like Death Metal.

1628
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,340
I do.

1629
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:19,340
I know you do.

1630
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:20,340
Um- Yeah, I like Guar.

1631
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:23,980
Actually, I've been listening to- really weirdly, I've been listening to a lot of Morrissey

1632
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:24,980
lately.

1633
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:29,020
Mainly, you know, because Morrissey was our emo when we didn't have emo.

1634
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:30,020
I love synth pop.

1635
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:31,020
That's not my big thing.

1636
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:34,820
Ever since DDR Ultramix 2 really got me into synth pop, like Echo Image and all that crap,

1637
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:35,820
I love it.

1638
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:36,820
Can't get enough of it.

1639
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:40,300
Um, Dee, you don't have the Nintendo Point Store in the US, do you?

1640
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,580
Um, are they still working on that?

1641
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:43,580
I haven't looked.

1642
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:44,580
A what?

1643
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:46,140
Nintendo Point Store.

1644
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,900
No, we don't have that in the US.

1645
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,060
The channel is there.

1646
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:54,060
No, the Point Store, what they're talking about, it's basically kind of like what they

1647
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:57,260
have for the Nintendo Club, I think, in Japan, where you-

1648
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:58,260
Oh, yeah.

1649
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,260
Oh, no.

1650
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:00,260
Buy titles and you earn points or stars.

1651
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,260
No.

1652
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:02,260
We're all pissed we don't have it.

1653
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:03,260
Yeah.

1654
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:04,260
No, we don't have it.

1655
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:09,500
Um, also, why, uh, why doesn't Nintendo partner with voice over IP like Skype?

1656
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:12,260
The Wiimote has a speaker plus mic, um, actually it just has a speaker.

1657
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:15,460
Why doesn't Nintendo actually have some online games for the Wii yet?

1658
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:17,540
I mean, it's because they're-

1659
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:21,180
For some reason, they feel they need to roll it out slowly, so whatever.

1660
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,180
It's their strategy.

1661
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:25,580
Somehow they feel they're ahead in innovation in some parts and they're really behind in

1662
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:27,100
other parts, so whatever.

1663
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:33,060
Um, some of these questions I think we've actually already answered, um, and so skipping

1664
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:39,180
through I'm gonna, um, say what does OLR team think of renting games, um, good way to test

1665
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:40,180
them out?

1666
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:42,620
It's something I should be doing that I'm not, honestly.

1667
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:47,820
I should be doing, using that Gamefly or comparable type service and I'm not.

1668
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,380
I really need to look into that.

1669
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,780
Yeah, maybe I would have avoided buying Red Steel.

1670
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:53,780
This is an interesting question.

1671
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:56,140
How do you go about getting a job in the game industry?

1672
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:59,740
I was wondering as I had many career paths open for me at the moment, including being

1673
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:00,740
a doctor.

1674
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:03,020
Um, sometimes you just chance into it.

1675
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:07,900
I have a friend who is a math major who now is a programmer for a company in the Bay Area.

1676
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,860
Well, Shane, you kind of work in the game industry.

1677
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:11,260
How did you get your job?

1678
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,260
Accident.

1679
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:13,260
Really?

1680
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:16,660
I was just, whoops, now I work at a game company.

1681
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:21,300
Yeah, it just depends on people you know or if you look at Craigslist.

1682
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:26,460
Most of the game companies post entry level positions there all the time.

1683
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:29,140
But you really have to be in an area where there's game companies.

1684
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:30,140
Yes.

1685
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:31,140
I mean if you live...

1686
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:33,140
Or your skill needs to be high in demand.

1687
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:38,020
I mean if you live in Wichita, Kansas, no offense Shane, that's where you used to live.

1688
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:40,340
If you live there, then you're probably not going to find a whole lot of...

1689
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:42,180
That's how I got my job, so...

1690
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:46,300
Well, but now you're here in California, aren't you?

1691
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:49,820
You know, it's best if you live where, Bay Area, LA?

1692
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:54,940
Wherever the major game companies are, you've got like Washington, the Redmond area, and

1693
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:57,780
then you've got the Bay Area, and then you've got LA.

1694
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:02,420
That's where you want to go for the major ones.

1695
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:06,740
The reality is though, if you're sitting there thinking, I've got a great idea for a video

1696
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:07,740
game...

1697
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:08,740
Wisconsin.

1698
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:10,460
Oh, they have the one company there.

1699
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:16,180
I'm just saying, because I was thinking about Mexico.

1700
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:18,940
A lot of major metros have at least one.

1701
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:24,400
Keep in mind that the industry, though, is very, very diverse.

1702
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,100
You can be an artist, get in as a designer.

1703
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,420
You can be a writer.

1704
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:35,040
I was asked if I was interested in writing game manuals, and part of why I was going

1705
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,980
to school was to actually do manuals.

1706
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:37,980
Why'd you turn that down?

1707
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:39,180
I didn't turn it down.

1708
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:41,660
I called on it and didn't hear anything.

1709
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:45,420
And that was actually for a writing strategy guide, so I don't really want to...

1710
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:46,900
I'm in school to do what I want to do.

1711
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:48,580
I'm going to be a massage therapist.

1712
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:54,740
I could freakin' be an independent contractor for a video game company, giving massages

1713
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:56,460
during people's lunch.

1714
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:57,460
Pac Bell does that.

1715
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:58,460
Oh, yeah.

1716
01:26:58,460 --> 01:26:59,460
A lot of major companies do.

1717
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:00,460
Our company does too.

1718
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:04,980
So I could work in the video game industry as a massage therapist.

1719
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:06,540
It's possible.

1720
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:09,140
I would love to have that be your catch on this show.

1721
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:12,660
She works in the game therapy, giving massages and happy endings.

1722
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,140
I don't give happy endings.

1723
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:18,700
You know what's funny, though, we learned that in San Francisco, in the county, for

1724
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,800
you to be a massage therapist there, you have to...

1725
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,900
It's considered adult entertainment, so you're lumped in the same category as prostitutes.

1726
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:25,900
Hot.

1727
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:26,900
I know.

1728
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:29,300
I hate it.

1729
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,300
The last question.

1730
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:33,420
I doubt that PS3 will sell many due to its high prices in the UK.

1731
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,100
It's going to be a lot over here.

1732
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:38,500
We get bummed at everything in gaming.

1733
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:41,040
Most young gamers already have a 360 or at least a Wii.

1734
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:45,180
Just thinking about how much market it will really have apart from now.

1735
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:46,180
Wow.

1736
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:47,180
It's Sony's stupid fanboy impression.

1737
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:52,420
I must say the graphics do look good, no better than 360, though, and played one with Ridge

1738
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:53,420
Racer.

1739
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:54,560
But you played Ridge Racer.

1740
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,560
That's not going to...

1741
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,560
Play Resistance, honestly.

1742
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,580
I think that that one really plays up the system's capabilities well.

1743
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:04,700
So apart from that, though, yeah, the rest of it's crap.

1744
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:05,700
Okay.

1745
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:07,260
I failed to keep it short, but oh well.

1746
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:10,180
This week has been busy going to college next week, so hope that goes well.

1747
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:11,180
Until next time, necky.

1748
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:12,180
Well, thanks for the email.

1749
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:13,180
That was a lot of questions.

1750
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:14,180
I was like...

1751
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,180
Yeah, and I actually skipped...

1752
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:16,180
20 questions from our UK fan.

1753
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:17,180
Sorry.

1754
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:20,420
He got to L, but one repeated.

1755
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,420
It's all good.

1756
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:22,420
It's all good.

1757
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:23,420
Okay.

1758
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:24,420
We have two more emails to go.

1759
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:25,420
All right.

1760
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:31,100
This one is from one of our listeners in Belgium, Fabrice.

1761
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:34,100
You know one good thing I liked that All Games had at their little thing?

1762
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:37,180
They had a big map of the world, and every time they got a collar from somewhere, they'd

1763
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:38,180
put a pin in the map.

1764
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,180
We should totally freaking do that.

1765
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,180
I think we totally need to steal that idea.

1766
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:42,180
For our email.

1767
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:43,180
I'm thinking about...

1768
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:44,180
Well, we could do both.

1769
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:45,180
We do emails on collars.

1770
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:46,180
We have blue pins for emails, red pins for collars, something.

1771
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:49,020
We have blue pins for emails, red pins for call.

1772
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:50,020
Exactly.

1773
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:53,340
I'm thinking we might steal that idea, because when I hear that we were getting collars from

1774
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,580
Argentina and mail from Belgium, that's so cool.

1775
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,580
I did think it was funny.

1776
01:28:56,580 --> 01:29:00,820
After a while, you just started handing me the pins, because I took my geography class

1777
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:03,980
like a year ago, so I still remember this crap.

1778
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:08,980
To continue on with the email, hi, O-L-R. First of all, congratulations on your radio

1779
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:09,980
show.

1780
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:13,500
Sadly, I've only discovered O-L-R since episode 180 or something since then.

1781
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,140
I've been listening every week.

1782
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:18,820
Also, I can't listen to your live show, because I live in Belgium.

1783
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:19,820
That's okay.

1784
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:20,820
We forgive you.

1785
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:23,460
I wonder what you at O-L-R think of the current state of Sega.

1786
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:27,140
The last years, they've done nothing but release crappy game after crappy game.

1787
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:32,420
As soon as they use the EA technique, release as much games as you can, and you'll earn

1788
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:33,420
money easily.

1789
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,820
Sonic the Hedgehog was somewhat the epitaph for what they are doing.

1790
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:42,060
They only had some good titles, but only the short period after the Dreamcast was dead,

1791
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,620
like Panzer Dragoon, Orta, etc.

1792
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:48,260
I'm a Sega fanboy, but it's even hard for me to get excited about a new Sega title.

1793
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:53,620
All I'm looking forward to is Sega Rally Revo and Virtua Tennis 3.

1794
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:54,620
What is wrong with them?

1795
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:56,940
Do they miss their own console?

1796
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:57,940
Did they go with the times?

1797
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:59,460
Are they lacking the talent?

1798
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:03,980
Will the Dreamcast days ever return when they made games like Virtua Tennis, Crazy Taxi,

1799
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:06,980
Shenmue, Rez, etc.

1800
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:13,180
They're all highly playable, enjoyable, and for everyone, not only the hardcore gamer.

1801
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:16,140
Sega wasn't afraid to experiment and come up with some crazy ideas.

1802
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:18,740
Anyways, I wonder what your thoughts on Sega are these days.

1803
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:21,020
Keep up the good work, and Dark Sakura Disneyland rules.

1804
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:23,020
I love you.

1805
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:28,620
I don't know, this is a tough question.

1806
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:31,660
I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that Sega was making systems for so long and

1807
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:32,820
now they only make games.

1808
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:36,620
So there has to be some downsizing that comes with that and some of your biggest talents

1809
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:37,620
jump ship.

1810
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:40,720
They were just in a funk.

1811
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:46,340
I think that when you are making games for your system, you know how to make it work

1812
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:47,340
on your system.

1813
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:54,140
I think that is a lot of strength that when it's your product and you have all the in-house

1814
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:57,600
stuff available to you, you know how to make the most of it.

1815
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:01,480
I really think that that might be hurting them with some of the newer titles, but also

1816
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:09,340
I think that honestly, I hate to say it, but Sega is going to need to get back on the track

1817
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:12,100
and find out what made them great to begin with.

1818
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:16,020
Instead of doing all the flashy, showy stuff, they need to get back to the heart.

1819
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:19,180
I think that they need to take a page from Nintendo.

1820
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:22,380
The Phantasy Star universe wasn't bad, in my opinion.

1821
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:23,620
It wasn't great.

1822
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:25,620
Well, not really average games to me.

1823
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:29,580
Full auto was awesome, and Chrome House was slow.

1824
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:31,620
Most people didn't like full auto or full auto 2.

1825
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:34,380
You're kind of in your own little bubble there.

1826
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:35,380
I enjoyed it.

1827
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:36,380
I enjoyed full auto.

1828
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:37,980
I did end up selling it back, but I enjoyed it.

1829
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:44,300
Full auto 2 is kind of, eh, but I mean, hell, they've got a ton of cool games coming out

1830
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,300
pretty soon.

1831
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:49,900
Sonic and the Secret Rings, which should be pretty cool, as long as the control is good

1832
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:50,900
on it.

1833
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:56,080
Virtua Fighter 5, I mean, that's going to be a pretty solid fighting game for the PS3.

1834
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,700
Sega Rally Revo.

1835
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:03,660
Armored Core 4, the game that I've been waiting for for the longest time.

1836
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:08,460
I bought Chrome Hounds thinking, hey, maybe it's Armored Core 4, but no, it's Armored

1837
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:13,180
Core 4 with mono or something like that.

1838
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:14,660
We need Knights on Wii.

1839
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:16,860
I want to say some interesting comments from chat.

1840
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:22,100
DDRDollarBill says, Sega needs to make more games that are unique.

1841
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:26,660
Bandit says, first Sega starts making consoles, then drop that and just got into games.

1842
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:28,460
Sony, you're next.

1843
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,060
The bold statement there.

1844
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:33,340
SSJ100Matt has an idea how Sega can get back to their roots.

1845
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:35,180
Two words, blast processing.

1846
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:39,380
Well, they're remaking some of their classic franchises like Alien and Syndrome.

1847
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:42,580
That looks pretty good for the Wii and like PSP and stuff.

1848
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:45,780
Crazy Taxi, they have some game coming, you know, called Crush.

1849
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:46,780
I know.

1850
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:48,780
I know that we'll save Sega.

1851
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:49,780
Sega to Sanchiro.

1852
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:54,700
Do you know the last Sega game I played that was absolutely badass and underrated in every

1853
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:58,900
way and that people should have respected more was F-Zero.

1854
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:02,540
Because remember that was the Sega, Nintendo, and Namco in the arcades partnership.

1855
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:03,540
That game was badass.

1856
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:05,420
That's still one of my favorite racing games ever.

1857
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:06,820
I don't know why they don't remake that.

1858
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:07,820
They need a new one.

1859
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:10,180
Sega needs to start doing games exclusively for Nintendo.

1860
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:14,180
Or you know what, I hate to say it, but since Nintendo doesn't have the oomph behind it,

1861
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:16,820
you know, with the Wii, the Wii doesn't have that pretty stuff.

1862
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:21,040
I'm sure there will be inevitably an F-Zero game on the Wii that will be pretty awesome,

1863
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:26,100
but seriously, like if Sega made a racer kind of like that, I'm not talking full auto, on

1864
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,100
the 360, ooh, that'll be hot.

1865
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:29,100
That'll be hot.

1866
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:31,980
You know what actually franchise, I wouldn't mind seeing coming out on the next system.

1867
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:32,980
Or PS3.

1868
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:37,500
There was a, I believe it was a Sega, it was Burning Rangers.

1869
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:44,360
In fact, I know it was because the music was on freaking Samba de Amigo, but we need Burning

1870
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,000
Rangers to come back.

1871
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,140
To clarify for chat, because they're saying F-Zero was done by Sega, not the original

1872
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:50,140
obviously.

1873
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:59,700
But the GameCube version and arcade, GX and AX, AX was Namco, Sega, Nintendo, the Triforce,

1874
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:02,900
and then GX was just Sega and Nintendo.

1875
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:05,500
And I'll tell you what, booting that game for the first time and seeing both those logos

1876
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:09,500
on the screen at the same time, that was a weird feeling for me, the 80s gamer.

1877
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:10,500
I'm sorry.

1878
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,300
Did it make you feel happy in the pants?

1879
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:15,660
No, it made me feel weird.

1880
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:18,940
I'm looking at this going, but Sega does what Nintendo don't.

1881
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:22,420
I don't, this is beyond comprehension.

1882
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:23,420
Another email?

1883
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:24,420
That actually was the last of our emails.

1884
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:25,420
Oh, it was nice.

1885
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:26,420
Another window opened.

1886
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:27,420
Okay.

1887
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:28,420
So yeah, send us more.

1888
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:29,420
Send us more.

1889
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:30,420
We like it.

1890
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:31,420
Mailbagorangeloungeradio.com.

1891
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:35,420
I'm sure after some of our stories tonight, we'll get plenty of emails.

1892
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:36,980
Battletoads versus Double Dragon.

1893
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:37,980
Hell yeah.

1894
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:38,980
We need a new one of that.

1895
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:40,260
Did Sega do that?

1896
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:41,260
It was on Genesis.

1897
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:45,460
Wasn't Tecmo responsible for both those franchises?

1898
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:46,460
I can't remember.

1899
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:50,140
Yeah, the Streets of Rage was Burning Knuckle.

1900
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:51,140
Acclaim.

1901
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:52,140
Battletoads is rare?

1902
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:56,220
No, Battletoads was Acclaim, I want to say.

1903
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:57,220
I'll remember.

1904
01:34:57,220 --> 01:35:00,380
Making me go to Wikipedia, god damn it.

1905
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:03,580
So anyways, we've got some interesting stuff about Nintendo, actually.

1906
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:09,100
Mad Catz is doing a third-party Wii-mote that looks like a penis.

1907
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:11,660
So way to go, Mad Catz.

1908
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:16,620
You've taken the Wii and made it look like a sex toy.

1909
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:17,620
Excellent.

1910
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:21,980
Yeah, it's supposed to be more ergonomic looking, but it looks like a penis.

1911
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:25,140
I'm sorry.

1912
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:28,900
Be sure to pick up your third-party penis by Mad Catz.

1913
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:29,900
Coming soon.

1914
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:30,900
Joy.

1915
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:31,900
Lovely.

1916
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:35,940
I remember them saying they were going to have the third-party Wii-motes, but it's kind

1917
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,780
of interesting to see what some of them look like.

1918
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:38,780
That looks like a penis.

1919
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:39,780
No, it doesn't.

1920
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:42,020
It does so look like a penis.

1921
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:43,020
Where are the balls?

1922
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:45,980
Okay, well, just a shaft.

1923
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:47,980
Let me see.

1924
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:49,420
It looks like a vibrator.

1925
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:53,420
That doesn't look like any penis I've ever seen.

1926
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:54,420
Fine.

1927
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:57,820
It looks like a sex toy, though.

1928
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:06,140
With those frickin' homemade programs that you can use your Bluetooth devices for, including

1929
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:11,220
the Wii vibrator thing, there you go, they've made the complete package for you.

1930
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:12,220
All right.

1931
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:17,260
By the way, thank you, Wikipedia, Battletoads was a video game franchise by Tradewest.

1932
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:22,500
The first game was released by Rare for the NES in 1991.

1933
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:23,500
There you go.

1934
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:28,180
I remember, I think Tradewest had something to do with Double Dragon, too, if that makes

1935
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:29,180
sense.

1936
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:31,740
Yeah, they made the original Double Dragon on the NES.

1937
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:32,740
There you go.

1938
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:33,740
Or published it.

1939
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:34,740
Whatever.

1940
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:38,580
Anyhow, this is a good time for us to take a break, I think.

1941
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:40,540
We've been going for a little while here, so we're going to take ourselves a little

1942
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:44,900
break, and we will come back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1943
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:49,420
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1944
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:50,420
a week.

1945
01:36:50,420 --> 01:37:05,100
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
