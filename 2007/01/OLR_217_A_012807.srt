00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:25,266
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, January 28th, 2007, Wii gets a new channel and rumors circulate of another, Sony gets confused about its own game, and a new PC release shatters sales records.

2
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:36,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:42,192
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that video game podcast dedicated to video games, the gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here to help you through the next few hours.

5
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:45,555
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:46,676
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky.

7
00:00:46,776 --> 00:00:50,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:51,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Roar.

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,400
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

10
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:53,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Roar!

11
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:53,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Roar!

12
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,311
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

13
00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:40,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but I was saying it for the sake of the noise that it was making.

14
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:40,986
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty bad.

15
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:42,627
[SPEAKER_07]: The death noise.

16
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,008
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to know what death metal is?

17
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:45,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Just let your brakes grind.

18
00:01:45,548 --> 00:01:48,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought her tire was flat, actually, is what I thought it was.

19
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got out of the car and I poked all the tires and they were fine.

20
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:52,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, oh, you're fucked.

21
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:54,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob probed my car.

22
00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:55,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

23
00:01:55,194 --> 00:01:55,694
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great.

24
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,495
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the one who had the probe.

25
00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:01,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello as well to the always probing Techmaster Loki.

26
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,977
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to turn that mic on so you can talk to us tonight.

27
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:05,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

28
00:02:05,637 --> 00:02:07,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how you doing?

29
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:07,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

30
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,220
[SPEAKER_02]: 217 weeks, we're still having difficulty turning on our microphone.

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't check these things.

32
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And I turned it off, too.

33
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:14,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I was the one that did that, so.

34
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:16,182
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week?

35
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:17,543
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a pretty good week?

36
00:02:17,883 --> 00:02:18,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was okay.

37
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:19,084
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good.

38
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:21,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize in advance.

39
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:23,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kind of lost my voice somewhat tonight.

40
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:27,468
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to hear that my voice is kind of scratchy, and I'm doing my best trying to drink some tea and coffee, but...

41
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:33,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Those folks that have emailed us or posted on web forums that Rob talks too much on the show.

42
00:02:33,614 --> 00:02:34,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob should shut up once in a while.

43
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:39,396
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably going to get your wish tonight because, as you can hear, I'm strained a little bit.

44
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:41,157
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got some emergency for you.

45
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:41,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

46
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:46,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably going to drink some a little later, but I need hot drinks for the throat, so I've been drinking some green tea.

47
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Boil it.

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,221
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make some coffee later.

49
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Boil it.

50
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:50,562
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be lovely and nasty.

51
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:51,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I might try it.

52
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:52,102
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

53
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:53,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I can drink whatever.

54
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:55,610
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

55
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:45,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I played a little bit more Cooking Mama, um, I haven't really had time to play much of anything as far as actual games go, um, although I'm really thinking I'm gonna actually, um, stick with Guild Wars for my game of choice, um, I might play, um, World of Warcraft, but right now I really don't have time with school, my education really is, is the focus, but last night I was over here while Rob was off in, uh, Rocky Land, and, uh, I was watching, uh,

56
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,593
[SPEAKER_07]: and Miklatov played through Silent Hill 2, which was awesome, but it wasn't scary to me.

57
00:03:51,474 --> 00:04:05,424
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only, like, one thing that really freaked me out, and I don't even remember what that... I think it was climbing down the ladder and having, you know, Pyramid Head just be there, and that spooked me a little bit, so... That was really it.

58
00:04:05,564 --> 00:04:06,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and I played some pinball.

59
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I downloaded a game for my phone, though.

60
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:10,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I downloaded Pac-Man pinball, and it's ass.

61
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:13,230
[SPEAKER_02]: What's wrong with it?

62
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,150
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just boring.

63
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:14,991
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not very...

64
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,401
[SPEAKER_07]: It's two fields and that's it.

65
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:19,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just a normal pinball game?

66
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:20,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

67
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:21,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid.

68
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:21,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds boring.

69
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:24,043
[SPEAKER_07]: They should do virtual pinball for the phones.

70
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:24,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I can play Black Knight.

71
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there cell phone games you enjoy?

72
00:04:26,484 --> 00:04:27,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's only one or two I enjoy.

73
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:32,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two that I play and that's Luminous and Bejeweled.

74
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:36,328
[SPEAKER_02]: The only two I play are Luminous and Super Pac-Man.

75
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:40,229
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Super Pac-Man is really hard to play on my phone.

76
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:47,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I would much rather play it on an arcade machine or something, but it's not bad for on the go.

77
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:52,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I did delete virtual pinball off of my computer because it turned out that I had no space left and I managed to free up 17 gig.

78
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.

79
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

80
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:57,823
[SPEAKER_07]: On a 250 gigabyte hard drive.

81
00:04:58,563 --> 00:05:00,845
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all the TV I'm downloading.

82
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to certain people who are trying to get me into watching Heroes.

83
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:04,728
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked.

84
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:06,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Bite my ass.

85
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:11,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to also introduce our invisible fourth guest who's always here with us every week.

86
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:15,475
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the chat room because Orange Lounge Radio, we believe in letting you guys be a part of our program.

87
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:20,638
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're listening live to us here on this Sunday evening, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

88
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:24,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on chat or I believe you can also just go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

89
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our lovely webmaster VX Jason XV set that up quite some time ago and I keep forgetting to announce it that way.

90
00:05:30,883 --> 00:05:32,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say hi to the noobs.

91
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:36,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Godlike93 introduced himself as a chatroom noob tonight.

92
00:05:36,564 --> 00:05:37,144
[SPEAKER_02]: So hi noob!

93
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:39,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I recognize all the other names.

94
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:42,285
[SPEAKER_02]: If I missed any other noobs in chat tonight, I apologize.

95
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:46,746
[SPEAKER_02]: The chatroom is pretty much being very foul as to why I have no voice tonight.

96
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:49,926
[SPEAKER_02]: NM64 said Sky ate too many dicks.

97
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:50,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw you.

98
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:52,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw you.

99
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:53,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I just screamed a lot.

100
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:58,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I said the F word repeatedly very loudly and that's why I have no voice today.

101
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:00,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course that doesn't really help, that story does.

102
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:03,373
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it does not.

103
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:04,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

104
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:07,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I want to edit that out of the show, but we don't do that.

105
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

106
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:12,216
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was fun.

107
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:18,358
[SPEAKER_04]: We played, I actually finished Resistance finally, and it's, the end's kind of okay.

108
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:19,819
[SPEAKER_04]: They're definitely making another one.

109
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:28,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't get a chance to play multiplayer though, I should have done that, but I was too busy playing Crackdown, the demo, and I played that about

110
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:37,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, six or seven times all the way through, so, you know, that's over three hours of crackdown, and it's a fun game.

111
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:39,802
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what I was hoping it would be.

112
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:51,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's the perfect game for me because you're this overpowered, like, almost like a superhero type character, just abusing the crap out of the citizens that live in this, you know, one city.

113
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:57,672
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I did get to play last night a multiplayer with JeremyTodd100, and it was...

114
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:00,834
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.

115
00:07:01,374 --> 00:07:04,855
[SPEAKER_04]: We just kept busting up just how retarded things got.

116
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:11,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of couldn't get into the Crackdown demo, but I played it when I didn't have a lot of time to spend with it.

117
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:14,617
[SPEAKER_02]: But you and I need to set a time so you can show me what the hell I'm supposed to do in that game.

118
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:15,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it looks like it's pretty.

119
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:17,018
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it might be fun.

120
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:25,399
[SPEAKER_04]: When you actually sit down and look at some of the detail in it, I mean, there's a lot of cars and people in that, which is a lot more than, say, Saints Row or something like that.

121
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like just the amount of detail in it.

122
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:58,427
[SPEAKER_04]: and just the fact that when you're not going around and trying to kill people you can climb a lot of stuff in there and that's actually kind of fun also it's kind of a different aspect of the game they reward you for that too in fact one of the achievements is climbing the tower that you start off in and that thing is high I managed to get up about 20, 30, 40 stories and they jumped off of it and landed on a cop to my enjoyment we both exploded once I hit the ground

123
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:01,175
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

124
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:23,473
[SPEAKER_04]: gang leaders in this already in 30 minutes.

125
00:08:23,593 --> 00:08:28,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there some footnote in the demo, though, that said it was moving at an accelerated pace, like the skills was accelerated?

126
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:37,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the skills were moving, you know, a bit faster, but, you know, if you spend enough time with it leveling up, you just kick the crap out of everybody later on, which is fine, you know, because it's fun.

127
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:49,718
[SPEAKER_04]: But co-op is definitely where it's at, and just, I really wish there was more than two players, but even what was kind of weird, though, when you're playing co-op, there was lag, but there was lag on, like,

128
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:51,062
[SPEAKER_04]: My end.

129
00:08:51,102 --> 00:08:54,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I would move and it would be delayed on my screen, which is kind of weird.

130
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:55,888
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was fun.

131
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:56,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.

132
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:58,552
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't wait to check out the full game.

133
00:08:59,673 --> 00:08:59,893
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

134
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:00,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

135
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it, yeah.

136
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:02,597
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

137
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:03,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

138
00:09:32,814 --> 00:10:01,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it kind of proves that putting Heavenly Star in the game was a bit of an afterthought I think it's kind of weird that Heavenly Star is the only song available right now too like don't you remember at E3 there was supposed to be Madonna and they were talking about they were getting together Warner Brothers Records to get all these you know songs you know where did those show up because I think it would have been better if they released a few of those for you know I don't know 400 points or whatever released several of those and had a mode for that like music video mode because the only place that Heavenly Star really works for me is using it in skin edit mode

139
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:11,215
[SPEAKER_02]: and when I'm playing it in skin edit mode I don't really play the whole song because you move on to the next skin after four levels and I'm actually getting better at Luminous so I can usually get through four levels in about half the song.

140
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:14,096
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't complain.

141
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:14,616
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free.

142
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:25,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I applaud Microsoft and Q Entertainment for trying to correct some of the micro transaction mistakes they made by making this content so cheap right now and

143
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:26,604
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

144
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:50,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, the other game I played was World of Warcraft.

145
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:52,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I've been getting sucked back into World of Warcraft.

146
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little 20-torn druid now, which I know some people are probably like, I can do that in no time flat.

147
00:10:57,217 --> 00:10:57,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?

148
00:10:58,426 --> 00:10:59,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a job.

149
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:00,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I have other stuff to do.

150
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:03,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having a lot of fun with it.

151
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:04,767
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a guild growing.

152
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,087
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some OLR listeners in it.

153
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:08,508
[SPEAKER_02]: We're over on the Ravencrest server.

154
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:10,788
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to join us, check out the forums for more details.

155
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:12,729
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not called OL Army, though.

156
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:16,369
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Silent Hill-based name, actually, for whatever reason.

157
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:18,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane's running the guild, and that's what he picked.

158
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:18,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Miklatov.

159
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,930
[SPEAKER_02]: You know him as Miklatov on the show.

160
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,650
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he picked.

161
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a good name for a Horde guild.

162
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,071
[SPEAKER_02]: So Horde side, Ravencrest.

163
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:24,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Visit the

164
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:29,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Launch Radio forums for more detail at OrangeLaunchRadio.com And that's it.

165
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:30,924
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much all my gaming week.

166
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:32,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Not anything else major.

167
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some other little bits here and there.

168
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might have played a game of Heavy Weapon.

169
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:35,646
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it.

170
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:37,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I played Heavy Weapon.

171
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:37,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Lame.

172
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:38,847
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't like it?

173
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:39,827
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I thought it was stupid.

174
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:42,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was way better than most of the stuff they've been releasing lately.

175
00:11:43,228 --> 00:11:43,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was dumb.

176
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

177
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:46,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I didn't buy it.

178
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,270
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I didn't?

179
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:49,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Zeldon Virtual Console

180
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:11,276
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

181
00:12:35,382 --> 00:12:37,323
[SPEAKER_02]: and I tried to play Gradius the other night.

182
00:12:37,343 --> 00:12:38,284
[SPEAKER_02]: That is one of the gameplays.

183
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Gradius on the Wii and I sucked.

184
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:45,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't get past the volcanoes in the first level because I swore I was going to do it without cheating.

185
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:48,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't go back and play Nintendo Gradius though.

186
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to play one of the later releases of it.

187
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Does my hand-eye coordination get that bad with age?

188
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:55,254
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just old, Rob.

189
00:12:55,435 --> 00:12:55,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so.

190
00:12:56,784 --> 00:13:15,631
[SPEAKER_02]: uh comments from chat room JeremyTodd1 says everyone has to buy a link to the past I don't care who you are what you do buy it anyway this game is the best game ever I agree it's probably one of the top five games of all time um HitStun says Heavy Weapon is nice by PopCap standards but that doesn't make it a good game I disagree um

191
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,222
[SPEAKER_02]: XBS Kid adds on to that saying the PopCap standard is the bottom of the barrel next to Flash games.

192
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:22,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

193
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:25,565
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some pretty crappy stuff on Xbox Live outside the PopCap stuff.

194
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:26,845
[SPEAKER_02]: At least there's some playability there.

195
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:27,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

196
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:28,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I disagree.

197
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:32,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think PopCap's the best thing ever, OMG, but I think some of the stuff they put out is pretty decent.

198
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob Coffee says, don't give in to World of Warcraft.

199
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:36,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Too late.

200
00:13:38,112 --> 00:13:40,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Alpha Canogram says, Sky, I love Heavenly Star.

201
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:45,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just annoyed that I can't turn off the sound effects because sometimes I want to hear the actual song while playing.

202
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:53,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know how on Luminous, you know, with the songs in the background, the little, like, rotating the shapes will make a noise, and clearing a block off the screen will make a noise?

203
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:55,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that does get in the way of the song.

204
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:56,447
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't mind.

205
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:57,628
[SPEAKER_07]: And for Shinin', though, wow.

206
00:13:57,668 --> 00:13:59,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and Shinin', it was incredible.

207
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:00,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind it in Heavily Star.

208
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:05,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, like, in Hollaback Girl, it's funny, if you have the PSP one.

209
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:12,034
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I saw Luminous Plus on PS2 for sale the other day, and I remember what you were telling me about how it's, like, it went down in price, right?

210
00:14:12,074 --> 00:14:12,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Luminous Plus on PS2?

211
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, it's $19.99.

212
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:16,517
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be out, though.

213
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:18,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not coming out until, like, way later.

214
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:23,242
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they had it on shelves at a place I went to at a GameStop, which you're usually pretty good about.

215
00:14:23,282 --> 00:14:25,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Luminous Plus doesn't come out until the end of next month.

216
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:25,583
[SPEAKER_02]: For real?

217
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:26,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have bought it.

218
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:30,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear, they had, like, 40 copies sitting right there on the shelf behind the little thing.

219
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:31,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Luminous Plus.

220
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:32,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

221
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:34,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe something happened.

222
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:36,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they shouldn't have that yet.

223
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:36,871
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.

224
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:38,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to check the web and see if it...

225
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:41,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if they change the price, they bumped up the release date.

226
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:43,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really want to get it on PS2, though.

227
00:14:43,478 --> 00:14:44,258
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too many versions.

228
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:45,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Xbox Live.

229
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:45,559
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good enough.

230
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Then again, it would depend on the songs.

231
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:51,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have some good licensed song in Luminous Plus, or is it just a port of the PSP version?

232
00:14:51,963 --> 00:14:52,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just a port of the PSP version.

233
00:14:52,983 --> 00:14:53,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Then forget it.

234
00:14:53,784 --> 00:14:54,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

235
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:55,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care, then.

236
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:57,286
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

237
00:14:57,888 --> 00:14:58,709
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

238
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:28,246
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you want to vote for an alternative, I suppose you can always vote for Travis.

239
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you want more details, listen to his show.

240
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:34,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturday nights at 7 o'clock, but not this upcoming week.

241
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,652
[SPEAKER_02]: DMN's going to call us later in the show because they scored a huge interview for this week.

242
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty jealous.

243
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:42,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And, Jamie, you are going to be pissed when you find out who it is.

244
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:43,754
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I have to say.

245
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:44,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.

246
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:45,716
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be pissed that they're not on this show.

247
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:46,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

248
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:49,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're going to want to reach to the screen and punch DMN.

249
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:49,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

250
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:50,378
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty good.

251
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:51,519
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll call in later in the program.

252
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

253
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:57,314
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura wanted to start off tonight's program a little bit, and we promised we wouldn't bring this story up again, but

254
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:19,973
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura had something she wanted to say.

255
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:22,174
[SPEAKER_02]: She wanted to talk about last week and us talking about it.

256
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:23,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just turn it over to her.

257
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,796
[SPEAKER_02]: So, DarkSakura, what do you want to say?

258
00:16:25,036 --> 00:16:29,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, about the whole two-gallon water drowning lady.

259
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Jennifer Strange, yes?

260
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:32,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.

261
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:33,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold your wee for a wee?

262
00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:33,702
[SPEAKER_02]: KDND?

263
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:35,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I can only remember her last name for some reason.

264
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:37,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was pretty strange.

265
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:39,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I got all of three emails about it.

266
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:44,189
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them was just stupid, and I immediately disregarded it because...

267
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:52,209
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to make a valid point, don't start off by calling people names and being an idiot, because then I don't respect you, and I will never pay attention to anything you say.

268
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:54,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it like a fuck you, you fucking fuck type of email?

269
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:57,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm like, you're an idiot, next.

270
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:07,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I did, however, receive one that really, I want to say it was a well thought out letter, and I appreciate it.

271
00:17:08,673 --> 00:17:14,214
[SPEAKER_07]: And just because, and I'm going to go ahead and say this, I am, God, chat room, knock it off, shit.

272
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:42,254
[SPEAKER_07]: What I was going to say before the chat room started acting like they had Tourette's is that I even went back and said, yeah, I don't think it was necessarily a matter of deserving it, but I come from the point of view of accountability for what you do.

273
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:43,852
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

274
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:09,888
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

275
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:43,003
[SPEAKER_07]: that it was my choice to get on the roller coaster in the first place.

276
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:44,204
[SPEAKER_01]: But what a way to go.

277
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:46,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, wouldn't that be awesome?

278
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:55,907
[SPEAKER_07]: But a friend of mine equated it though with, you know, if you go out, if you're a woman going out at midnight to 7-11, there's a chance that you can get pounced in the alleyway and raped.

279
00:18:56,448 --> 00:18:57,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's the difference.

280
00:18:57,808 --> 00:19:00,829
[SPEAKER_07]: She wasn't forced down onto the ground and forced water down her throat.

281
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:05,771
[SPEAKER_07]: She actually chose to do it after there was a warning calling in, after they were saying, do you feel sick?

282
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you need to stop?

283
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:06,791
[SPEAKER_07]: People

284
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:08,142
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

285
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:27,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that she had a choice, and that's what I'm saying.

286
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't think people should discount the fact that she did have free will involved.

287
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:33,934
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what people are doing.

288
00:19:34,154 --> 00:19:40,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we can all get past this story, because I know I'm kind of sick of hearing about it, especially living here.

289
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Because keep in mind, this was in our backyard, and we are hearing about this nonstop.

290
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:46,384
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in our paper every day, some type of new development.

291
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:53,290
[SPEAKER_07]: On top of that, I talked it over with several of my coworkers, lots of my friends, and everyone's saying, did we learn about this in middle school?

292
00:19:54,948 --> 00:20:00,493
[SPEAKER_07]: If you saturate your body with water without replacing sodium, your brain's not going to function.

293
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,234
[SPEAKER_07]: That you learn in middle school.

294
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:11,482
[SPEAKER_07]: And for me, my whole thing is just that I don't... Yeah, the radio station fully, they are fully responsible.

295
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:17,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not I'd say fully responsible, but they should be the ones punished for the event, not her.

296
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:19,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that what happened to her is a horrible tragedy.

297
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:23,332
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that people should just not say...

298
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,611
[SPEAKER_07]: She had no part in the blame.

299
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:29,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate the word blame.

300
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:33,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that people should understand she did choose to participate.

301
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:37,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think this should have happened to her.

302
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think any of that should have happened.

303
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,845
[SPEAKER_07]: But just let her be accountable.

304
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:45,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Let her be posthumously accountable and not the big bad victim.

305
00:20:45,648 --> 00:20:47,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we're a country of victims and it's sickening.

306
00:20:48,342 --> 00:20:48,582
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

307
00:20:48,962 --> 00:21:00,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to try and keep the show moving, but I do want to say this, just kind of a friendly reminder that Orange on Radio, part of the reason why we're here is to let gamers all have their voice, whether you may agree with it or not.

308
00:21:00,785 --> 00:21:06,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's on a very superficial level, where it's Nintendo versus Sony versus Microsoft.

309
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:10,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes we call Sony executives names, and you may not agree with that.

310
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:10,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes...

311
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:12,208
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

312
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:36,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Blunt opinions and controversial opinions sometimes, and you may not always agree with it, but we do have the right to have that voice nevertheless.

313
00:21:37,335 --> 00:21:42,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't agree with Jamie 100% on this particular thing, but she has the right to say it, and I defend her right to say it.

314
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:49,187
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also want to kind of get that out, because if you're going to email me saying Jamie should be off the show, that's not going to do any good.

315
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:49,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Did somebody do that?

316
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:50,868
[SPEAKER_02]: You were CC'd on it.

317
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:52,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, was it that?

318
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll talk later.

319
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:54,712
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was...

320
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm going to be off of the show that I helped make.

321
00:21:58,491 --> 00:21:59,331
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to happen.

322
00:21:59,371 --> 00:21:59,912
[SPEAKER_02]: That's stupid.

323
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:06,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she, you know, even if I disagree with her, I think part of the lure of the show is that I can hear her thoughts.

324
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:09,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Firebomb had pointed it out.

325
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:12,260
[SPEAKER_07]: It said, but she's a woman and she therefore has no opinion.

326
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:12,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it?

327
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:15,462
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only complaints I got were from men.

328
00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:16,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

329
00:22:17,914 --> 00:22:23,538
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, we probably have just more men than women that listen to this show, and that's just the culture we're in.

330
00:22:23,698 --> 00:22:33,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I notice, though, in general, that any time I could say something and Matt could say the exact same thing, but I'm the one that gets the emails about it, that I should be quiet.

331
00:22:33,546 --> 00:22:33,946
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

332
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:35,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, universe.

333
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a woman.

334
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:39,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an opinion, and you're going to fucking shut up and listen to it, so fuck you.

335
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how I feel.

336
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:51,137
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you have the right to express your rebuttal arguments with your intelligent emails and phone calls we do later in this program.

337
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:54,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie's not totally shut off to hearing what else you guys might have to say.

338
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:55,999
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously.

339
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:59,401
[SPEAKER_07]: You present your rebuttal to me in an intelligent way.

340
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm more than happy to discuss it with you.

341
00:23:01,502 --> 00:23:04,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we can agree to disagree, but I love to hear.

342
00:23:04,523 --> 00:23:05,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I invite anybody.

343
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:09,225
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got an opposite opinion to what I have, I love debate.

344
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:09,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

345
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,806
[SPEAKER_07]: So prove it.

346
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:12,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring it.

347
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:14,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I will discuss with you until the cows come home.

348
00:23:42,498 --> 00:23:45,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we had a bunch of stories, and not just, you know, release dates and stuff.

349
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:58,631
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, we had a follow-up to, you know, a game we talked about we announced originally on episode 206, High School Musical the Game, which, you know, to me, I mean, I wasn't too interested about this.

350
00:23:58,711 --> 00:24:00,392
[SPEAKER_04]: It is coming out for the Wii and PlayStation 2.

351
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:07,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It's based on the Disney Channel, like, musical that they're apparently selling very well on DVD and stuff.

352
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:20,236
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's actually kind of made it more interesting for me, and as we put on the website earlier this week, High School Musical The Game is actually going to be featuring a microphone peripheral for the Wii, which is kind of neat.

353
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,717
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently you're going to be singing karaoke.

354
00:24:22,737 --> 00:24:31,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if it's going to be an actual, you know, its own unit, like its own controller, or if it's going to be something that plugs into the bottom of the Wiimote.

355
00:24:31,998 --> 00:24:34,979
[SPEAKER_04]: But either way, you're going to be singing karaoke with this thing.

356
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,959
[SPEAKER_04]: It is going to be coming out now.

357
00:24:37,837 --> 00:24:41,821
[SPEAKER_04]: In August, $69.99 for the bundle.

358
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:51,271
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of interesting to see some actual companies making some attachments for the Wii other than, say, some stupid steering wheel like the Ubisoft games.

359
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,434
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was kind of neat.

360
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:57,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Other stuff we announced this week, including...

361
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:05,445
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a brand new PSP game coming out based on the Girls Gone Wild franchise and it's actually a pool themed game.

362
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:20,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Originally it was going to be called Pocket Pool by itself and then they picked up the Girls Gone Wild license and now Eidos is producing it and basically it's going to be your standard billiards game but you unlock nudie pictures so who doesn't like some good nudie pictures?

363
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:21,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is hilarious.

364
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:23,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a great name for the game by the way.

365
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:24,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hilarious.

366
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:26,769
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally we've got

367
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:28,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, some other stuff.

368
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:32,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Ubisoft, they announced Brothers in Arms War Stories for the DS.

369
00:25:33,374 --> 00:25:41,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I've been reading some other sites out there saying that they've heard the same thing, but they're getting their info from the ESRB website because it was listed on there.

370
00:25:41,736 --> 00:25:43,516
[SPEAKER_04]: But either way, it is coming for the DS.

371
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:50,138
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be coming out on June 13th for $29.99 and should be some interesting stuff.

372
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:55,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there was a little bit of elaboration for Driver 76, as I mentioned a few episodes back.

373
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:57,553
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, um...

374
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:14,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega's Virtua Fighter 5, and this is also, you know, the street dates have been listed on other sites.

375
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:25,515
[SPEAKER_04]: But according to Sega themselves, they signed a six-month exclusive contract with Sony for the PlayStation exclusivity of it.

376
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:27,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you hear this?

377
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I haven't heard this anywhere else about this six-month deal.

378
00:26:30,618 --> 00:26:34,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard this actually from Sega because they came into our Dallas office yesterday.

379
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:40,729
[SPEAKER_04]: to do, you know, kind of their lineup of stuff, and I was questioning them about, you know, dates and stuff.

380
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:46,612
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I was emailing our buyer about dates, and she said that they're on a six-month exclusive deal.

381
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:53,837
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and that, I know GameStop had a tentative date on their website as, what was it, August something.

382
00:26:54,297 --> 00:27:01,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It was towards the end of August, but it would be six months from when it's actually released in February for the PlayStation 3.

383
00:27:01,982 --> 00:27:02,642
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but, um,

384
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:05,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's kind of interesting.

385
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:10,831
[SPEAKER_04]: And, yeah, as far as, that was the exclusive news we had.

386
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:13,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, and then of course my favorite one here.

387
00:27:13,992 --> 00:27:17,013
[SPEAKER_04]: The two Konami Wii titles that are going to be coming out in March.

388
00:27:17,213 --> 00:27:26,876
[SPEAKER_04]: They announced Wing Island and Kororinpa Marble Mania is going to be coming out as well for the Wii.

389
00:27:26,976 --> 00:27:30,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Both are going to be pretty reasonably priced, only $39.99 for each.

390
00:27:31,157 --> 00:27:32,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Both coming out on the 28th.

391
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:34,861
[SPEAKER_04]: of March.

392
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:41,023
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure we'll have more info about that next week after Konami's Gamer's Day.

393
00:27:41,403 --> 00:27:43,844
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was some interesting stuff.

394
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:48,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, was that Koro as in like C-H-O-R-O or Koro as in... K-O-R-O.

395
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:49,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

396
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:52,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I want another Koro game.

397
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:58,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, there was some other stuff, other announcements regarding dates as well.

398
00:27:59,901 --> 00:28:00,962
[SPEAKER_04]: This one, Rob, you're going to like.

399
00:28:01,102 --> 00:28:02,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Elevator Action for the Wii.

400
00:28:02,422 --> 00:28:03,963
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out on June 13th.

401
00:28:04,103 --> 00:28:05,884
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty rad arcade game.

402
00:28:05,924 --> 00:28:07,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be curious to see what they do with it.

403
00:28:07,764 --> 00:28:07,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

404
00:28:08,585 --> 00:28:14,868
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, Bladestorm's been delayed on the PlayStation 3 to June 15th as well.

405
00:28:15,768 --> 00:28:20,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Juarez for the Xbox 360 is coming out on June 15th.

406
00:28:21,531 --> 00:28:27,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And Turok for the PlayStation 3 and 360 also going to be coming out in September on the 12th.

407
00:28:29,992 --> 00:28:31,773
[SPEAKER_04]: So, lots of good stuff.

408
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:37,778
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll, of course, be posting more dates to our under-the-radar thread that we have on the forums.

409
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:39,158
[SPEAKER_04]: So, keep an eye on that.

410
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:40,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.

411
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:49,065
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, speaking of the Wii, I guess we're getting elevator action pretty soon, and now we're getting rumors about new channels that could be coming to the Wii.

412
00:28:49,405 --> 00:28:57,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when the Wii went out and they first announced the Wii, we all knew we were going to be getting, you know, the forecast channel, the news channel, the internet channel at some point.

413
00:28:57,688 --> 00:29:06,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now there are rumors of a game channel, and this was spurred by remarks that were made by John Lee, who is the Hudson Entertainment Director of Marketing.

414
00:29:07,594 --> 00:29:25,076
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't say anything too specific about it, but when he was asked about downloadable games for the Wii, this was his quote, quote, however, in the future, you should rephrase that question to, are there any plans to launch original content on some downloadable service on the Wii, and you might get a different answer.

415
00:29:25,726 --> 00:29:30,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Nintendo, of course, said, you know, we cannot confirm what format the new content will be delivered.

416
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:32,649
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be original games at the Wii Shop eventually.

417
00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:35,390
[SPEAKER_02]: But it could be interesting because this is launching speculation.

418
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:43,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be just a whole new channel to separate classic Nintendo titles and these, you know, downloadable titles in a new channel by itself.

419
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:47,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Why couldn't he just not be a jackass about the whole thing?

420
00:29:47,615 --> 00:29:48,575
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?

421
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:49,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

422
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:52,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't answer your question because you didn't ask me the correct question.

423
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:53,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Riddle me this!

424
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:58,317
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there are NDAs and things, so I think he's trying to think of a clever way around it.

425
00:29:58,358 --> 00:29:59,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he's a jackass.

426
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:10,163
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, I mean, there's just like, it's like, you know, if you're asking, say, for example, imagine you're asking Sony when the PlayStation 3 is going to be coming out in the UK or something like that.

427
00:30:10,563 --> 00:30:15,986
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, so, when are you guys going to be releasing the PlayStation 3 in the UK?

428
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:18,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, you did not ask the correct question.

429
00:30:19,187 --> 00:30:20,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Misquestion in the form of a walrus.

430
00:30:22,336 --> 00:30:23,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Jeopardy

431
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:38,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Firebomb asks an interesting question out of left field here a little bit.

432
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:42,111
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, weren't we supposed to have different colors for Wii consoles by now?

433
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:43,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say I read a story.

434
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:55,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not in our show world tonight, but I want to say I read a story somewhere on the internet earlier this week about that, yeah, they were going to do different colors, but since they're having trouble keeping the gray ones on shelves as it is, that the new colors are going to be quite some ways off.

435
00:30:55,497 --> 00:30:58,598
[SPEAKER_02]: New colors will be something they do when they want to sell more systems.

436
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,099
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to do it right now.

437
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:01,420
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

438
00:31:14,028 --> 00:31:15,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Dually shit that you don't need for it.

439
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:17,510
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting to see how the Wii is.

440
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,271
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm just thinking about this because I read it today.

441
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:22,654
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends on LiveJournal, my old roommate, who wasn't much of a gamer.

442
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the very first OLR studio, my roommate there?

443
00:31:27,257 --> 00:31:28,878
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't that super into games.

444
00:31:28,898 --> 00:31:31,599
[SPEAKER_02]: He always kind of thought the show he did was kind of weird, but he thought it was cool, right?

445
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he made this post in LiveJournal today about how he wants a Wii because he played one over the weekend.

446
00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:36,583
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought it was awesome.

447
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:38,784
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, I don't really get into video games, but the Wii was fun.

448
00:31:39,224 --> 00:31:41,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting to read things like that.

449
00:31:41,326 --> 00:31:43,407
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so interesting to read from the not...

450
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:48,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Take some time away from the game blogs once in a while to read what other people have to say.

451
00:31:48,188 --> 00:31:49,169
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just very interesting.

452
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:52,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Nintendo's very, very happy at a reaction like that.

453
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,170
[SPEAKER_07]: That was their goal, was it not?

454
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose it was.

455
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:00,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have actually a little bit more coming from Nintendo, specifically about the channels.

456
00:32:01,772 --> 00:32:07,373
[SPEAKER_07]: The news channel, there's a pretty good review of it, I found.

457
00:32:08,114 --> 00:32:10,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you... I've played with the news channel.

458
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:12,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I played with that a little bit this week.

459
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:12,795
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

460
00:32:13,174 --> 00:32:16,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, basically, the news channel, and this is a couple things that I like about it.

461
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,956
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like it's got pretty easy browsing to it.

462
00:32:19,577 --> 00:32:21,257
[SPEAKER_07]: It brings up your local news based on your area.

463
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:26,059
[SPEAKER_07]: You can click on Globe, though, and it shows you where you are in relation to the rest of the world.

464
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:27,080
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty cool.

465
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,101
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also, there's a slideshow.

466
00:32:32,962 --> 00:32:36,663
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the headlines come through at the bottom half, and you pick wherever.

467
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:44,960
[SPEAKER_07]: You bring up any of the stories that come up on the slideshow by pressing A. It's pretty easy to follow, I think.

468
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:57,616
[SPEAKER_07]: It's looking like, they said that the relaunch of it is going to be later this year and it's going to be free and offer more regions available for viewing.

469
00:32:58,308 --> 00:33:02,270
[SPEAKER_07]: But so far it seems so, you know, so far so good pretty much.

470
00:33:02,611 --> 00:33:03,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like it quite a bit.

471
00:33:03,511 --> 00:33:05,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it more than I like the forecast channel.

472
00:33:05,793 --> 00:33:14,538
[SPEAKER_02]: But my only suggestion for the news channel would be that, you know how the forecast channel has the temperature and things in the Wii browser?

473
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:20,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you don't have to launch the forecast channel just to see the temperature, although it's horribly out of date, at least for this region.

474
00:33:20,401 --> 00:33:22,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it never updates after midnight or 6 a.m.

475
00:33:23,283 --> 00:33:24,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it never updates for the rest of the day.

476
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:25,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

477
00:33:43,727 --> 00:33:48,410
[SPEAKER_02]: You have links to news articles usually or RSS feeds that run kind of along the side of your email.

478
00:33:48,691 --> 00:33:51,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes that's what makes me stop and go, oh, that sounds interesting.

479
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:58,137
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually why I stopped using most of those because my email is through my friend Julie's server and I don't have to worry about any of that.

480
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:00,515
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't mind it.

481
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:02,636
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I have a Yahoo page.

482
00:34:02,696 --> 00:34:04,798
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I use Firefox ad block and stuff.

483
00:34:05,158 --> 00:34:08,400
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, when you use Yahoo Mail, it shows you some of the top headlines.

484
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I stopped using Yahoo Mail just because of that.

485
00:34:11,903 --> 00:34:17,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to have my news where I can, you know, if I'm going for news, I'm going specifically for news.

486
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:21,850
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why the first thing that I have pull up is my Yahoo page and I have my world events and all that listing.

487
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:24,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I would really, though, this is my hope.

488
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not quite sure what their news source is.

489
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:29,582
[SPEAKER_07]: But I hope that they don't go with... Associated Press.

490
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:31,443
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a two-year agreement with Associated Press.

491
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:31,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

492
00:34:32,023 --> 00:34:39,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I still... I'm very leery about most of our press publications just because there's a lot of bias, a lot of...

493
00:34:43,176 --> 00:34:50,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what I thought was hilarious is, you know, of course, one of the first places I went to look for stories locally once I got to the globe was Sacramento.

494
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:59,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what the top news story was in the Sacramento region on the news channel was about the, you know, again, here's more news in the hold your wee for a wee thing as if we could have more.

495
00:34:59,186 --> 00:35:01,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I was reading BBC News and saw crap on it.

496
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:03,229
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

497
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:24,169
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was interesting that that was on the news channel.

498
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:28,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could even see a picture of a PlayStation 3, and it was kind of one of those moments.

499
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:33,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the very first time you see the Nintendo and Sega logos on the screen together, like when you boot up F-Zero.

500
00:35:33,557 --> 00:35:36,279
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of those moments, like looking at a picture of a PlayStation 3 on your Wii.

501
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:36,839
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird.

502
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,080
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very awkward.

503
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like you with your Elebits icon on Xbox Live.

504
00:35:40,342 --> 00:35:40,703
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

505
00:35:41,063 --> 00:35:45,226
[SPEAKER_02]: My Friends list icon on Xbox Live is an Elebit, so I guess it's not the first time.

506
00:35:45,406 --> 00:35:48,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, at one time, my background was a picture of Mario Kart.

507
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was when I was playing around with using backgrounds from the computer.

508
00:35:52,476 --> 00:35:55,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just fun to do little things like that, I suppose.

509
00:35:55,578 --> 00:35:56,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I like irony.

510
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:02,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, speaking about the Wii, there's going to be some fun stuff coming to the Virtual Console soon.

511
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:11,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the biggest games coming to the Virtual Console, and only to Trump, was it last week's Link to the Past?

512
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:18,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zelda The Ocarina of Time is going to be heading to at least the Japanese Virtual Console in February.

513
00:36:19,103 --> 00:36:29,185
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be slated for 1,200 points and of course is going to make it to the United States shortly after the Japanese one, if not the same day.

514
00:36:31,186 --> 00:36:31,626
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

515
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:33,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Not interested.

516
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:35,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well that's awesome for other people.

517
00:36:36,497 --> 00:36:39,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not interested either because I had it on GameCube for the longest time.

518
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

519
00:36:40,641 --> 00:36:42,482
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Wii can play GameCube games.

520
00:36:42,682 --> 00:36:43,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the point?

521
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:46,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I, you know, I understand.

522
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:52,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes people go like, well, Rob, then why do you bother downloading anything on there at all when you can just use emulators?

523
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, because I can't use emulators on my TV with a wireless remote.

524
00:36:55,032 --> 00:36:56,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just too lazy to set that thing up.

525
00:36:56,994 --> 00:36:58,796
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the authentic experience.

526
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:03,219
[SPEAKER_02]: But using that little GameCube disc with the Zelda game on it is a pretty authentic experience.

527
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:04,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

528
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:05,241
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

529
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:08,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get the point of downloading it.

530
00:37:08,382 --> 00:37:09,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be downloading Mario Kart.

531
00:37:09,803 --> 00:37:10,803
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the best part, though.

532
00:37:13,424 --> 00:37:18,006
[SPEAKER_04]: When this game does come out, it's going to be great, and people are going to download it and stuff.

533
00:37:18,026 --> 00:37:28,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Then later on down the line, remember how they were talking about, oh, yeah, well, we can do a line of games, and thank the Game Boy Advance here when they released the old Nintendo games for it again.

534
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:35,574
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do a line of games that are just GameCube and maybe Nintendo 64 games ported over with the controls for the Wii.

535
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:48,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'd have Mario Kart Double Dash or whatever ported over and being sold for $29.99 or something like that with just no changes whatsoever other than the controls for the Wii.

536
00:37:50,624 --> 00:37:57,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch this kind of happen or they release some sort of collector's edition of all the Zelda games or something again.

537
00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:02,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reading what the chat room has to say on this.

538
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:05,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeremy Todd 1 says, I have played and beat Ocarina of Time a few too many times now.

539
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:13,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I beat it on 64, I beat it on the GameCube, I beat it on the computer, whistles, and like OLR said, I have the GameCube game so I can just play that.

540
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:21,935
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 would like to point out, you know, playing the Ocarina is kind of hell with the C-stick, which doesn't make sense because you didn't have the buttons on the GameCube, you had that stick.

541
00:38:22,495 --> 00:38:23,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well...

542
00:38:23,852 --> 00:38:24,432
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

543
00:38:46,817 --> 00:39:00,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Kama Itachi no Yoru, Megami Tensei, Super Goals and Ghosts, Sango Kushi 4, Bare Knuckles, Streets of Rage, Beyond Oasis, Vector Man, Sword of Vermilion,

544
00:39:05,248 --> 00:39:32,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Vigilante on TurboGrafx-16, Chu Man Fu, Yokai Doshuki, and Wonder Momo also all coming out on TurboGrafx-16 so sounds like there's a lot of cool stuff coming out on your Japanese Virtual Console and many of those titles that do have American versions will probably be seeing those before too long Bare Knuckle, that brings back memories because we picked up the Japanese cart and used a converter on it to play on our Nomad and it played it as Street to Rage and it was a Bare Knuckle cart

545
00:39:33,055 --> 00:39:33,555
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.

546
00:39:33,595 --> 00:39:34,276
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it know that?

547
00:39:35,097 --> 00:39:36,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes they'll do that.

548
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:44,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, a lot of the Neo Geo games will have a Switch, so you can play them in either version.

549
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:51,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Our Japanese Samurai Spirits 2 is Samurai Shodown 2, and it'll play depending on what mode we have it in.

550
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:59,314
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'd like to see Nintendo do, and this is going to seem completely out of left field, but I would like to see them release some Japanese games that never got released here.

551
00:40:00,245 --> 00:40:26,126
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and just, I mean, I guess local Freaking Panorama Cotton, hi Well, okay, that's a little obscure, but I'm thinking Earthbound on the NES, Mother Zero or whatever it's, or no, the original Mother, which we call Earthbound Zero on that translated ROM No, it wasn't a translated ROM, it was a ROM that somebody bought on eBay, which is a prototype So it's like that game is floating around there, half done Wouldn't that be awesome if that, like, came out on the virtual console?

552
00:40:26,846 --> 00:40:27,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree I don't know

553
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:33,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's just too much work, but I can't believe that Nintendo isn't making an arm and a leg off a lot of these Virtual Console games.

554
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:35,343
[SPEAKER_07]: We need the freaking TurboGrafx Twinbee.

555
00:40:36,683 --> 00:40:37,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we'll see.

556
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:37,764
[SPEAKER_07]: And Parodius.

557
00:40:37,924 --> 00:40:38,724
[SPEAKER_07]: We need Parodius.

558
00:40:38,864 --> 00:40:39,464
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

559
00:40:40,744 --> 00:40:41,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

560
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:50,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, something that will make a lot of people happy, speaking of Virtual Console, is Mario Kart 64 is going to be on Virtual Console in Europe.

561
00:40:50,327 --> 00:40:56,049
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually the second Nintendo 64 title to be on the European Virtual Console.

562
00:40:57,009 --> 00:40:57,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

563
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:03,100
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really, it's Mario Kart.

564
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:13,807
[SPEAKER_07]: There's really not much else to be said about it, but there's also a notice that Soldier Blade, which is a TurboGrafx-16 game, is also going to be available for 600 points.

565
00:41:15,568 --> 00:41:17,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everybody's getting in on the Mario Kart love now.

566
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,832
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to see another Nintendo 64 title get up there, though.

567
00:41:21,465 --> 00:41:26,088
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you, Mario Kart on the 64 was the best version next to the original.

568
00:41:26,508 --> 00:41:27,949
[SPEAKER_07]: All you need is Pokemon Snap.

569
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:28,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Toad's Highway.

570
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:29,791
[SPEAKER_02]: End of story.

571
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:31,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon Snap.

572
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:32,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree.

573
00:41:32,272 --> 00:41:33,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon Snap would be pretty awesome.

574
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:35,734
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Superman 64?

575
00:41:35,815 --> 00:41:38,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck no.

576
00:41:38,857 --> 00:41:39,657
That was so funny.

577
00:41:39,717 --> 00:41:40,938
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be kind of cool.

578
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Blast Corpse or something like that.

579
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:48,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon Puzzle League Actually, GoldenEye64 You know what you'd probably like?

580
00:41:48,447 --> 00:42:01,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Dream on, it's a rare game Once they start doing the light gun games and stuff They should do... Super Scope Well, Super Scope would be awesome But the Pokemon Snap or something like that

581
00:42:02,051 --> 00:42:03,491
[SPEAKER_02]: How awesome was the Super Scope?

582
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:04,812
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a bazooka for God's sake.

583
00:42:04,852 --> 00:42:05,712
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.

584
00:42:05,932 --> 00:42:07,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I think it was hard.

585
00:42:07,532 --> 00:42:18,195
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember sitting playing, because I had a Super Scope when they came out, sitting there playing freaking Blastress for long enough to wear out the battery in the Super Scope.

586
00:42:18,215 --> 00:42:20,035
[SPEAKER_07]: It was six hours.

587
00:42:20,475 --> 00:42:22,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I have some folks agreeing with me in chat room.

588
00:42:22,796 --> 00:42:25,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex says, Pokemon Puzzle League FTW.

589
00:42:25,557 --> 00:42:27,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Rama says, I like Pokemon Puzzle League.

590
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:28,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what's up.

591
00:42:29,038 --> 00:42:30,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a Super Scope just to put on my desk.

592
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:32,381
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one.

593
00:42:32,521 --> 00:42:34,522
[SPEAKER_02]: You can probably get one at the auction.

594
00:42:34,862 --> 00:42:35,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one.

595
00:42:35,402 --> 00:42:35,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want it?

596
00:42:37,023 --> 00:42:37,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

597
00:42:37,323 --> 00:42:37,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take it.

598
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:39,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see if we can find it.

599
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,264
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually have a Menacer somewhere, too.

600
00:42:42,325 --> 00:42:47,306
[SPEAKER_07]: The attachment that hooks onto the Master System gun.

601
00:42:47,987 --> 00:42:52,148
[SPEAKER_02]: JVmon's leading a chant in the chatroom for Yoshi's Safari with the Wii remote.

602
00:42:52,188 --> 00:42:52,908
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be kind of fun.

603
00:42:53,308 --> 00:42:54,389
[SPEAKER_07]: We need more Metal Slug.

604
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:56,229
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you talking about?

605
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:58,130
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the fucking anthologies out on Wii.

606
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:58,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

607
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:59,170
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it.

608
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,471
[SPEAKER_07]: But we need more Metal Slug anyway.

609
00:43:00,571 --> 00:43:01,111
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't.

610
00:43:03,055 --> 00:43:04,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how we did that in unison.

611
00:43:05,176 --> 00:43:06,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Great minds think like me.

612
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:09,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, no, Wrestlemania 2000 should definitely be on virtual console.

613
00:43:11,598 --> 00:43:12,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

614
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:23,021
[SPEAKER_04]: So, speaking of the Wii, there's one website that's actually creating sculptures of Miis, which is kind of cool.

615
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:30,964
[SPEAKER_04]: AllisonQMcCarthy.com She's actually, well, obviously her name's not .com, but you know what I mean.

616
00:43:31,545 --> 00:43:32,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching.

617
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:33,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you next time.

618
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:57,856
[SPEAKER_04]: They should totally have a service like that.

619
00:43:57,896 --> 00:43:58,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, think about it.

620
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,539
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing the same thing for Spore, where you can create your own custom stuff.

621
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:04,402
[SPEAKER_02]: That made me think of the exact same thing, like you can print your monsters for Spore.

622
00:44:04,782 --> 00:44:06,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I'm looking at this.

623
00:44:07,084 --> 00:44:07,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do these.

624
00:44:08,366 --> 00:44:09,907
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, I think... Well, then do it.

625
00:44:10,007 --> 00:44:10,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Make me one.

626
00:44:10,988 --> 00:44:14,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have to do... I have two more Dolphys to face up on.

627
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:14,532
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a woman.

628
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:15,473
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make things, right?

629
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:17,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Rob, bite my ass.

630
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:19,977
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways... Are they like little bobbleheads?

631
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of.

632
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:23,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they sort of look like a bobblehead.

633
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,683
[SPEAKER_07]: They look like they're made from stuff at Michael's.

634
00:44:26,883 --> 00:44:27,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it looks cute.

635
00:44:28,284 --> 00:44:30,786
[SPEAKER_07]: They are cute, but... Make me one.

636
00:44:31,686 --> 00:44:34,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the stuff that's on these, you can buy them at Michael's.

637
00:44:34,448 --> 00:44:35,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you put up a shut-up, Jamie?

638
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:39,210
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously, I'll do one once I have time between classes.

639
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:39,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

640
00:44:40,631 --> 00:44:41,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I got free stuff.

641
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:49,476
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely keep an eye on AllisonQMcCarthy.com and maybe square yourself your own me.

642
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:51,891
[SPEAKER_04]: How much are they charging for the Miis?

643
00:44:52,852 --> 00:45:01,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Not saying yet because I think she's just starting off with this and got picked up by everywhere and now they're getting inundated with requests.

644
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:02,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor thing.

645
00:45:03,596 --> 00:45:05,476
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the downsides to getting digged.

646
00:45:06,617 --> 00:45:07,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that on dig?

647
00:45:07,357 --> 00:45:07,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure it was.

648
00:45:07,957 --> 00:45:08,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it probably was.

649
00:45:09,398 --> 00:45:09,658
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

650
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Nintendo's really digging the recent sales of the Wii.

651
00:45:14,122 --> 00:45:15,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the Wii has just been selling like crazy.

652
00:45:17,003 --> 00:45:21,304
[SPEAKER_02]: 3.2 million Wiis sold is what Nintendo announced earlier this week.

653
00:45:22,105 --> 00:45:22,985
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty crazy.

654
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:24,326
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot else.

655
00:45:24,486 --> 00:45:25,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what else can you say about that?

656
00:45:25,626 --> 00:45:26,987
[SPEAKER_02]: They sold 3.2 million Wiis.

657
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:27,447
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot.

658
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:29,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly interesting.

659
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I don't mean to sound anti-Sony.

660
00:45:31,048 --> 00:45:32,609
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I'm trying to do here.

661
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,050
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is interesting when you see a thing like this.

662
00:45:35,745 --> 00:45:36,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo DS

663
00:45:59,244 --> 00:46:01,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if Sony is going to start pissing their pants.

664
00:46:20,228 --> 00:46:20,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

665
00:46:21,149 --> 00:46:23,630
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they'll have some creative little press release for this.

666
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,371
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be all the drugs that Kutaragi's taking.

667
00:46:26,111 --> 00:46:30,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackboy in chat sums it up, says, God, Nintendo is making money hand over fist.

668
00:46:31,654 --> 00:46:34,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo is selling in a month and a half with 360 cells in a quarter.

669
00:46:35,737 --> 00:46:36,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

670
00:46:37,293 --> 00:46:40,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we have something, a comment on a story we did a little bit ago.

671
00:46:40,796 --> 00:46:47,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Cutie Honey is in chat and says, the only Metal Slug America is missing is Metal Slug 3D, which isn't terribly good.

672
00:46:47,643 --> 00:46:50,446
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's to go along with your comment on we need more Metal Slug.

673
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:51,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I said, no, we don't.

674
00:46:53,428 --> 00:46:55,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Metal Slug has to stay two-dimensional.

675
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:56,812
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just the awesomeness of it.

676
00:46:59,594 --> 00:47:01,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I give Metal Slug a lot of crap.

677
00:47:01,435 --> 00:47:02,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of fun.

678
00:47:02,336 --> 00:47:04,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just give Jamie crap for it because she never shuts up about it.

679
00:47:04,798 --> 00:47:05,878
[SPEAKER_02]: But 3D, no, no, no.

680
00:47:06,419 --> 00:47:07,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Slug 3D, no, no, no.

681
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played it, but I'm not interested.

682
00:47:09,881 --> 00:47:12,683
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to play Metal Slug going the other direction, just play Shock Troopers.

683
00:47:14,284 --> 00:47:14,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

684
00:47:15,525 --> 00:47:20,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, off the topic of Metal Slug, but still an awesome game.

685
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:22,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Scarface is coming out.

686
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:32,794
[SPEAKER_04]: For the Wii, and that's awesome, because apparently, I was reading on some of the features of this, you're going to be able to wield a chainsaw and use the Wiimote to chop off limbs.

687
00:47:32,994 --> 00:47:34,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God, this is what we needed.

688
00:47:35,675 --> 00:47:37,535
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome, what are you talking about?

689
00:47:38,576 --> 00:47:41,017
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm serious, this really is what we needed.

690
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:42,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, come on.

691
00:47:43,012 --> 00:47:51,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever since we heard the Wii is like GameCube with a Nitro boost in it, it's like, well, then where's my fucking Resident Evil 4 with my chainsaw?

692
00:47:51,339 --> 00:47:51,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

693
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just, I don't know.

694
00:47:55,002 --> 00:47:56,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Words cannot describe how happy I am.

695
00:47:57,184 --> 00:48:04,931
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, I mean, I was kind of interested in the Godfather game coming out in March, but... Do you get to whack people with the Wiimote?

696
00:48:05,431 --> 00:48:08,834
[SPEAKER_04]: You do get to manhandle people, though, with the Wiimote.

697
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:09,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you say that again?

698
00:48:10,242 --> 00:48:14,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Manhandle people with the Wiimote That sounds pretty fun

699
00:48:31,738 --> 00:48:39,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, while we wait for Scarface to come out on the Wii, he could go to a completely different genre, yet on another Nintendo system.

700
00:48:39,527 --> 00:48:40,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the Game Boy Advance?

701
00:48:41,161 --> 00:48:41,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy 6 Advance Release

702
00:49:04,878 --> 00:49:06,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

703
00:49:33,344 --> 00:49:39,867
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting because this website that I'm looking at the story on, SiliconEra.com, actually poses the same question.

704
00:49:39,968 --> 00:49:41,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Terra going to be Tina?

705
00:49:41,608 --> 00:49:42,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did they change that?

706
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:43,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.

707
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:46,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Tina is such a bad word.

708
00:49:47,271 --> 00:49:50,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe is it because Tina sounds more American than Terra?

709
00:49:50,913 --> 00:49:51,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

710
00:49:51,753 --> 00:49:55,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for anyone who doesn't know, Terra's original name in the Japanese Final Fantasy VI was Tina.

711
00:49:56,976 --> 00:49:58,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, no, I guess that's the other way around.

712
00:49:58,357 --> 00:49:59,617
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

713
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:00,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played the Japanese one.

714
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:04,921
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sorry, yeah, I guess it was Terra here.

715
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:07,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they going for maybe the double entendre, where Terra's kind of like Earth?

716
00:50:08,124 --> 00:50:09,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't... Maybe.

717
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:09,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

718
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:11,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems a little silly.

719
00:50:11,746 --> 00:50:13,548
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like the whole Eris, Aerith thing.

720
00:50:15,289 --> 00:50:15,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it?

721
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:24,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Aerith makes more sense, but then again, if you translate it by the kana, it would kind of... Aerith would also make sense for translation purposes.

722
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:24,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

723
00:50:25,928 --> 00:50:31,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one thing that Jamie probably uses to do her translation is several websites out there on the internet.

724
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:37,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly she likes to surf the internet up and down and back and forth every week finding her favorites of the internet.

725
00:50:37,753 --> 00:50:40,194
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes up DarkSakura's website of the week.

726
00:50:41,094 --> 00:50:44,155
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers this week?

727
00:50:46,136 --> 00:50:48,697
[SPEAKER_07]: You should actually be going to PayPal and send me money.

728
00:50:50,098 --> 00:50:50,838
[SPEAKER_07]: No, really.

729
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:52,739
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not a Doctor Who site.

730
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll do one next week.

731
00:50:53,879 --> 00:50:54,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

732
00:50:57,372 --> 00:51:06,937
[SPEAKER_07]: The website of the week is MassageTherapy.com I've been spending a lot of time there because I'm in school to be a massage therapist.

733
00:51:07,538 --> 00:51:15,582
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really good though because it has a lot about learning about massage, finding a massage therapist for your own needs, media.

734
00:51:16,002 --> 00:51:22,106
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing that I really think is cool in here is there's a body work glossary in here.

735
00:51:22,782 --> 00:51:31,626
[SPEAKER_07]: that lists out a lot of different things you might hear as far as naturopathy, different type of health-related things.

736
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:32,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really cool.

737
00:51:34,328 --> 00:51:38,950
[SPEAKER_07]: I've learned actually a lot of different modalities just reading through the freaking glossary.

738
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:49,515
[SPEAKER_07]: So if anyone is into, even if you're not a massage therapist, even if you don't receive massage, if you're into natural health, it's really worth looking through, and it's been very, very educational to me.

739
00:51:50,878 --> 00:51:53,940
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt says, Jamie, there's no happy ending section.

740
00:51:55,342 --> 00:51:55,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

741
00:51:57,483 --> 00:52:01,706
[SPEAKER_07]: People who give happy endings are not real massage therapists.

742
00:52:01,846 --> 00:52:06,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is that MassageTherapist.com or MassageTheRapist.com?

743
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,131
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Massage Therapy.

744
00:52:09,272 --> 00:52:11,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's very funny since this is, you know, my chosen profession.

745
00:52:11,894 --> 00:52:12,314
[SPEAKER_02]: A joke.

746
00:52:12,414 --> 00:52:13,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, it's a little joke.

747
00:52:13,395 --> 00:52:13,695
[SPEAKER_02]: A little humor.

748
00:52:13,715 --> 00:52:16,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but I don't think it's a funny joke because it's... I thought it was funny.

749
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:17,818
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought it was funny.

750
00:52:17,878 --> 00:52:18,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a little humor.

751
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:19,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Are either of you massage therapists?

752
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:20,280
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

753
00:52:21,124 --> 00:52:21,664
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

754
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:51,814
[SPEAKER_02]: No, all kidding aside, you may think at first glance that this has nothing to do with gaming, but I say, you know what, if your ass starts to feel numb from so much hardcore gaming, or your back starts, maybe massage therapy's for you.

755
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:53,355
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I've noticed?

756
00:52:54,436 --> 00:53:06,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I, actually, since I've started doing massage, as in giving massage, my endurance in cardiovascular work, aerobics, has greatly improved.

757
00:53:06,923 --> 00:53:11,066
[SPEAKER_07]: So, giving a massage is just as healthy as receiving one if you do it the right way.

758
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:13,313
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good for everybody.

759
00:53:14,314 --> 00:53:14,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

760
00:53:15,254 --> 00:53:15,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

761
00:53:16,534 --> 00:53:28,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of unhappy endings, apparently there's actually going to be a price increase, sort of, in the Canadian PlayStation 3s.

762
00:53:28,698 --> 00:53:31,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, a price increase for the PlayStation 3?

763
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:35,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody screwed up somewhere, big time.

764
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:40,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone apparently listened to our contest that we had, you know, with the...

765
00:53:42,593 --> 00:53:43,974
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 3, and more.

766
00:54:02,463 --> 00:54:07,466
[SPEAKER_04]: 99.99.

767
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:07,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It says both Best Buy and Future Shop have the console listed at the new price.

768
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:10,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says the old list price used to be 659.99.

769
00:54:11,108 --> 00:54:15,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Hasn't the console already been out there for some time?

770
00:54:17,231 --> 00:54:19,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that they're increasing price.

771
00:54:20,033 --> 00:54:21,394
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's my thing though.

772
00:54:21,414 --> 00:54:21,454
[SPEAKER_04]: If

773
00:54:22,441 --> 00:54:31,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they're having the same situation as we are here, but if they're like, you know, the consoles are rare there, maybe they're just raising prices because they can probably sell them for that.

774
00:54:31,286 --> 00:54:33,407
[SPEAKER_02]: At least throw in a free game, jeez.

775
00:54:34,348 --> 00:54:34,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

776
00:54:34,668 --> 00:54:35,068
[SPEAKER_02]: That's silly.

777
00:54:35,668 --> 00:54:38,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, Canada sometimes gets bundle packs that we don't get here.

778
00:54:39,691 --> 00:54:46,014
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but yeah, I guess whatever the case is, they're getting hosed over there, so.

779
00:54:46,835 --> 00:54:51,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, we don't mean to keep picking on Sony, but look, guys, they just

780
00:54:51,533 --> 00:54:53,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep giving us material, what can we say?

781
00:54:53,614 --> 00:55:02,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And Major Nelson over from Microsoft's camp was very quick to point out this week that Sony made a big fat boo-boo on one of their sites.

782
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:09,045
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a PSP site touting video downloads, and one of the video downloads was for Gran Turismo HD Concept.

783
00:55:09,065 --> 00:55:12,387
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the things you could download, try to get people psyched about the PlayStation 3.

784
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:21,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they had a screenshot on the website from Gran Turismo HD, but, oops, it wasn't actually a screenshot of Gran Turismo HD.

785
00:55:22,033 --> 00:55:25,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a screenshot of Project Gotham Racing 3 on Xbox 360.

786
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:28,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, talk about a fuck-up.

787
00:55:28,477 --> 00:55:37,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that is... You know that that's just some tiny little mistake some intern probably made somewhere, but still, I mean, not... Where was the QA on that?

788
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Something got screwed up big time.

789
00:55:42,144 --> 00:55:47,147
[SPEAKER_04]: And to kind of follow up with that story I was just talking about, according to a Sony rep...

790
00:55:47,697 --> 00:55:48,917
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the actual case.

791
00:55:49,498 --> 00:55:59,481
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, although the suggested retail price of the PlayStation 3 in Canada has not changed, some Canadian retailers have chosen to increase their retail price as a result of the weaker Canadian dollar.

792
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:06,543
[SPEAKER_04]: This increase is solely at the discretion of the retailer, as Sony Computer Entertainment Canada has not issued a price increase.

793
00:56:07,463 --> 00:56:08,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the clarification.

794
00:56:08,484 --> 00:56:09,164
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes more sense.

795
00:56:09,364 --> 00:56:09,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

796
00:56:11,058 --> 00:56:12,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I like our chatroom comments.

797
00:56:12,898 --> 00:56:17,439
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 pokes fun at the Ridge Racer phenomenon going, it's Project Gotham!

798
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:19,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Gotham!

799
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:20,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

800
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it doesn't have the same thing to it, but I see what he did there.

801
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:24,880
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty good.

802
00:56:27,061 --> 00:56:28,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Sony's still, though.

803
00:56:29,061 --> 00:56:31,301
[SPEAKER_07]: They still have something shoved up their ass, I think.

804
00:56:32,562 --> 00:56:34,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you remember us talking about that Ghostbusters game?

805
00:56:35,082 --> 00:56:35,382
[SPEAKER_01]: I do!

806
00:56:36,182 --> 00:56:40,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Zoofly did confirm that they wore

807
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:44,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Preliminary working on one for Xbox 360.

808
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:54,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony Pictures, however, has pretty much told Zootfly to shut up, pretty much.

809
00:56:55,257 --> 00:56:57,578
[SPEAKER_07]: They've removed the content from their website because of Sony.

810
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:01,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Any of the content on YouTube has been removed.

811
00:57:03,222 --> 00:57:05,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that just was a breach of NDA, I think.

812
00:57:07,011 --> 00:57:11,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Heaven forbid someone put something out there that got people excited for Sony.

813
00:57:12,232 --> 00:57:16,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it could be the fact that Sony owns the rights to the Ghostbusters movies.

814
00:57:18,233 --> 00:57:19,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know, whatever.

815
00:57:22,454 --> 00:57:24,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't the game being created for Sony?

816
00:57:24,534 --> 00:57:32,475
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was being created by Zootfly, and they have to get everyone's permission, or they hadn't gotten the permission from any of the actors.

817
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:35,716
[SPEAKER_02]: But wasn't it being created by them for a Sony console?

818
00:57:36,127 --> 00:57:38,428
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just being created by them because they like Ghostbusters.

819
00:57:38,768 --> 00:57:41,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I totally misread that story the first time.

820
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:42,150
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

821
00:57:43,431 --> 00:57:43,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

822
00:57:45,932 --> 00:57:49,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, okay, then I guess Sony was just protecting their rights.

823
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,294
[SPEAKER_04]: They're well within their rights.

824
00:57:50,594 --> 00:57:50,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

825
00:57:51,595 --> 00:57:56,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, still, it's never fun to hear about games going away that we were a little bit excited for.

826
00:57:56,857 --> 00:57:58,398
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it makes us a little bit angsty.

827
00:57:58,871 --> 00:58:03,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about you guys, but I get pretty pissed off when games I get excited for get cancelled.

828
00:58:03,755 --> 00:58:06,137
[SPEAKER_02]: And that calls for some FUs of the week.

829
00:58:06,557 --> 00:58:07,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, boys and girls?

830
00:58:08,198 --> 00:58:08,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

831
00:58:08,558 --> 00:58:09,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

832
00:58:22,129 --> 00:58:25,792
[SPEAKER_07]: The first FU of the week that I have goes towards the...

833
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:28,915
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in terror on my car.

834
00:58:29,035 --> 00:58:33,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, really, it's not anything that I didn't expect.

835
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,137
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you drive your car on road trips, it's gonna wear out.

836
00:58:36,858 --> 00:58:40,239
[SPEAKER_07]: But just, it was really kind of freaking me out last night.

837
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:42,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't expect it to just start grinding that suddenly.

838
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, we shelled out $150 for parts.

839
00:58:46,442 --> 00:58:50,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Thankfully, we have a friend who can replace brakes.

840
00:58:50,323 --> 00:58:53,724
[SPEAKER_07]: And brakes on the Mitsubishi Lancer are very thick and easy to replace.

841
00:58:54,445 --> 00:58:55,005
[SPEAKER_07]: What, Robb?

842
00:58:56,312 --> 00:58:56,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not you.

843
00:58:56,792 --> 00:58:57,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking about something else.

844
00:58:58,053 --> 00:58:58,774
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not related.

845
00:59:00,855 --> 00:59:04,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I not allowed to laugh and have a good time at this show?

846
00:59:04,617 --> 00:59:05,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Not when I'm talking about my car.

847
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,801
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he can laugh.

848
00:59:09,821 --> 00:59:17,886
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, a big, big, major Uber FU goes to my car not being immortal, I guess.

849
00:59:18,986 --> 00:59:22,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And another one goes to Rob for parking like an asshole.

850
00:59:23,891 --> 00:59:24,351
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

851
00:59:24,371 --> 00:59:27,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I had to pick your ass up because your car was in the shop.

852
00:59:27,394 --> 00:59:30,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Had I not had to pick your ass up, I wouldn't have had to repark the car.

853
00:59:30,877 --> 00:59:36,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, tell me, how many times have you been in the car with me when I pulled into a spot and then backed up and adjusted my parking?

854
00:59:36,701 --> 00:59:37,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck!

855
00:59:38,963 --> 00:59:41,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to contort myself to get out of your damn car.

856
00:59:43,387 --> 00:59:45,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And no thank you for the ride or anything like that.

857
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:48,271
[SPEAKER_02]: You park like an asshole, you jerk.

858
00:59:48,391 --> 00:59:50,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I thanked you for the ride when you picked me up and I gave you cookies.

859
00:59:51,493 --> 00:59:52,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave you cookies!

860
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:53,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the cookie was good.

861
00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:55,132
[SPEAKER_07]: My cookies are great.

862
00:59:56,353 --> 00:59:58,334
[SPEAKER_07]: My cookies bring all the rubs to my house.

863
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:01,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm bringing more cookies next week, too.

864
01:00:03,257 --> 01:00:03,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

865
01:00:04,838 --> 01:00:13,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, you did a superwoman that was in front of me when I was trying to get out of my apartment complex today because she saw us behind her and she walked slower because she's a jackass.

866
01:00:14,905 --> 01:00:17,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, another thing, what the hell's the point?

867
01:00:18,287 --> 01:00:23,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at decalgirl.com and they have a skin that you can buy for your PlayStation 3 that's black.

868
01:00:23,843 --> 01:00:24,683
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like stupid.

869
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:29,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the hell would I cover my PlayStation 3 with a skin that's the same color as the goddamn PlayStation 3?

870
01:00:31,486 --> 01:00:31,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

871
01:00:31,906 --> 01:00:32,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

872
01:00:32,146 --> 01:00:33,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

873
01:00:33,387 --> 01:00:34,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're an idiot, I guess.

874
01:00:35,428 --> 01:00:35,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So fuck them.

875
01:00:37,609 --> 01:00:43,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to give an FU of the week to my Saturday, because it kind of sucked, because I had a migraine, which sucks.

876
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:45,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they really suck.

877
01:00:45,152 --> 01:00:46,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get them very often.

878
01:00:46,252 --> 01:00:47,393
[SPEAKER_02]: When I do, it really sucks.

879
01:00:47,873 --> 01:00:50,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had that, and then I got sick off of dinner, and

880
01:00:51,775 --> 01:00:53,036
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

881
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:25,309
[SPEAKER_04]: All those music game franchises, they're so old.

882
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:36,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Bomani, Konami is holding a pop and music culture festival at Tokyo's Lafayette Museum.

883
01:01:37,854 --> 01:01:40,155
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty awesome.

884
01:01:40,255 --> 01:01:42,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of festivities going along with that.

885
01:01:42,256 --> 01:01:45,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Artists performing, DJs, etc.

886
01:01:47,731 --> 01:01:52,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure I, like most people, had similar reactions where it's like, 10 years?

887
01:01:53,235 --> 01:01:55,296
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been 10 freaking years?

888
01:01:55,417 --> 01:01:56,017
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I'm old.

889
01:01:57,678 --> 01:01:58,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, seriously.

890
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about you guys, but that's my reaction.

891
01:02:01,381 --> 01:02:13,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember, you know, when I first saw Bomani, you know, I remember it was at Fanime, and we went up to one of the rooms that was there, and they were playing Beatmania on a PlayStation 3.

892
01:02:14,614 --> 01:02:23,220
[SPEAKER_04]: and they were playing, I remember the song too, it was the Metal Gear Solid theme and I was just like, fucking A, that's awesome.

893
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:24,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I gotta buy this.

894
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:32,247
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did and I played it and I stopped playing it and then next time I saw DDR4th Mix and I was like, ooh, I gotta get that too.

895
01:02:33,348 --> 01:02:41,874
[SPEAKER_04]: And then next thing you know, I'm going to the arcades and I meet these crazy people and they're doing a radio show and my life just spiraled downhill.

896
01:02:41,894 --> 01:02:43,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And here you are, yes, it's all downhill from there.

897
01:02:44,048 --> 01:02:45,529
[SPEAKER_07]: What was your first Bimani?

898
01:02:46,109 --> 01:02:51,692
[SPEAKER_02]: The very first time I saw Bimani, I went to Milpitas Golf Land to play golf, and I saw a bunch of people dancing on the machine.

899
01:02:51,712 --> 01:02:57,215
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like fun, because I was playing Busta Groove 2 on the PlayStation at the time.

900
01:02:59,336 --> 01:03:02,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not know anything about Japanese imports at the time, so I was playing Busta Groove 2.

901
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:04,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm forgiving you.

902
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:05,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of me is.

903
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,081
[SPEAKER_07]: The other part of my heart is breaking.

904
01:03:07,101 --> 01:03:08,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let it break.

905
01:03:09,822 --> 01:03:11,043
[SPEAKER_02]: You're too sassy tonight.

906
01:03:11,641 --> 01:03:13,183
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

907
01:03:33,624 --> 01:03:34,464
[SPEAKER_02]: in Las Vegas.

908
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:42,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I played at Circus Circus with a guana girl who ended up going on to be some big admin over at that DDR Freak site.

909
01:03:42,587 --> 01:03:44,468
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think she really plays much anymore.

910
01:03:44,968 --> 01:03:46,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was my first game.

911
01:03:46,409 --> 01:03:48,549
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't admin much anymore either.

912
01:03:48,609 --> 01:03:55,032
[SPEAKER_07]: But my first was, and you're going to laugh at this, was when I still lived in Alabama playing BM98.

913
01:03:55,272 --> 01:03:57,633
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember BM98?

914
01:03:58,093 --> 01:03:58,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki left the room.

915
01:03:58,873 --> 01:03:59,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm stealing a french fry.

916
01:04:00,014 --> 01:04:00,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me one too.

917
01:04:00,614 --> 01:04:00,994
[SPEAKER_06]: You want one too?

918
01:04:01,014 --> 01:04:01,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

919
01:04:01,684 --> 01:04:02,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me his toast.

920
01:04:02,845 --> 01:04:03,805
[SPEAKER_01]: You want his toast?

921
01:04:04,526 --> 01:04:05,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.

922
01:04:05,406 --> 01:04:05,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a fry.

923
01:04:06,307 --> 01:04:06,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't tell.

924
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:08,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, yes, BM98, yeah?

925
01:04:08,368 --> 01:04:09,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh.

926
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:13,911
[SPEAKER_07]: BM98 was awesome because it was customizable.

927
01:04:13,991 --> 01:04:20,515
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of... I think it was honestly one of the precursors to many of our simulators today.

928
01:04:21,815 --> 01:04:28,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, so I got to play a lot of the early Beatmania songs probably right around...

929
01:04:29,514 --> 01:04:30,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, yeah, 1998.

930
01:04:30,734 --> 01:04:39,336
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my first DDR was playing the first Mix Home one when I moved out here from Alabama.

931
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:47,839
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I played my first actual machine at... Don't glare at me.

932
01:04:47,899 --> 01:04:48,739
[SPEAKER_02]: She took one, too.

933
01:04:49,099 --> 01:04:50,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob took it for me, though.

934
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:51,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that my 7-up?

935
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:52,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that my 7-up?

936
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I get a fry.

937
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I don't care if you're eating my food.

938
01:04:56,981 --> 01:04:57,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, go get me a root beer.

939
01:04:58,106 --> 01:04:59,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I look like your bitch?

940
01:04:59,547 --> 01:04:59,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

941
01:05:02,908 --> 01:05:04,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob wants to go get me a root beer.

942
01:05:04,048 --> 01:05:05,689
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

943
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:21,575
[SPEAKER_07]: But I honestly think that the simulators like BM98 got a lot of people in the very early days of Bimani into these games who might not have otherwise had access to them.

944
01:05:23,496 --> 01:05:24,536
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember trying to make

945
01:05:25,214 --> 01:05:30,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Make a file a long ass time ago for BM98 and I just couldn't do it because I got really bored doing it.

946
01:05:32,636 --> 01:05:37,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And from what I understand, actually, it's sort of seeing a resurgence in fan communities.

947
01:05:37,317 --> 01:05:38,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's kind of cool.

948
01:05:40,218 --> 01:05:44,339
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite, though, has to be Delight Delight Reduplication.

949
01:05:44,779 --> 01:05:45,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have that.

950
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:46,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Somewhere.

951
01:05:47,674 --> 01:05:59,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember how awesome it was when Dance with Intensity came out, and it was just like, wow, this is so much better, and then Step Media came out, and that was pretty cool too, but who'd have thought?

952
01:06:00,643 --> 01:06:09,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, slightly related to the family of Bimani games is one, the really horrid game that I think Konami should disavow any knowledge of, and that's Dance Dance Dance.

953
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:11,130
[SPEAKER_07]: It was shitty.

954
01:06:12,912 --> 01:06:16,114
[SPEAKER_07]: In my professional opinion, as an internet celebrity.

955
01:06:16,618 --> 01:06:22,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you hate it when you think of good ideas, like right when you get back in the chair and somebody in the chat room actually said it.

956
01:06:22,121 --> 01:06:24,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Bandit says, bet he shakes the can.

957
01:06:24,542 --> 01:06:25,862
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been an awesome idea.

958
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:28,323
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it didn't.

959
01:06:28,383 --> 01:06:30,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially because Jamie's working on her laptop.

960
01:06:30,564 --> 01:06:31,125
[SPEAKER_02]: She would have cried.

961
01:06:31,865 --> 01:06:36,327
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I would have picked up my destroyed laptop and thrown it at your PC.

962
01:06:37,968 --> 01:06:39,048
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been a fun show.

963
01:06:39,408 --> 01:06:40,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly we're knocked off air.

964
01:06:41,538 --> 01:06:44,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And then JeremyTodd1 would like to point this out.

965
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,742
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent this to me in a message there in the chat room.

966
01:06:48,302 --> 01:06:51,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's sent me a little slip from youparklikeanasshole.com.

967
01:06:52,225 --> 01:06:55,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'd like to point out he didn't even see it, JeremyTodd1.

968
01:06:55,687 --> 01:07:03,311
[SPEAKER_02]: He checked off two spots, one car, a little too close, over the painted lines, diagonal parking, cool car, diagonal parking, not so cool car.

969
01:07:03,331 --> 01:07:05,333
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he checked off other for sucking.

970
01:07:05,353 --> 01:07:05,753
[SPEAKER_02]: For sucking.

971
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:11,302
[SPEAKER_07]: DMN agrees with me and JeremyTodd1, by the way.

972
01:07:11,383 --> 01:07:14,165
[SPEAKER_02]: For this, JeremyTodd1 gets a kick from the chatroom.

973
01:07:14,245 --> 01:07:15,225
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just do that.

974
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:16,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Control, kick.

975
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:16,746
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

976
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice good kick from the chatroom.

977
01:07:18,468 --> 01:07:21,890
[SPEAKER_07]: DMN wanted me to punch you in the arm, and he gave me a heart if I did it.

978
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:23,311
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm gonna punch Robin.

979
01:07:23,391 --> 01:07:23,691
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

980
01:07:23,852 --> 01:07:24,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you a gut!

981
01:07:25,032 --> 01:07:25,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Ow!

982
01:07:27,534 --> 01:07:28,615
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a real bitch tonight.

983
01:07:29,015 --> 01:07:29,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not!

984
01:07:29,876 --> 01:07:30,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm nice.

985
01:07:31,657 --> 01:07:32,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave you cookies.

986
01:07:35,071 --> 01:07:35,892
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always the cookies.

987
01:07:35,912 --> 01:07:37,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It always comes back to the cookies.

988
01:07:37,413 --> 01:07:37,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

989
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:38,833
[SPEAKER_07]: You did it all for the cookie.

990
01:07:39,174 --> 01:07:39,774
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

991
01:07:39,954 --> 01:07:42,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Did everybody have fun reminiscing about the Bimani?

992
01:07:42,735 --> 01:07:43,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and thank you for my root beer.

993
01:07:43,896 --> 01:07:44,296
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

994
01:07:44,777 --> 01:07:45,057
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

995
01:07:45,357 --> 01:07:57,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Harmonix talked this week a little bit about something that's not Bimani related because, you know, Harmonix didn't make Bimani, but certainly they're a huge, huge player in the music video game franchise, and they are talking about the guitar.

996
01:07:57,043 --> 01:07:58,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, technically they did kind of.

997
01:07:58,939 --> 01:07:59,280
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

998
01:08:14,033 --> 01:08:21,296
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the folks that works over at Harmonix, and that would be Daniel Sussman, who is a producer over Harmonix, quote, Here's the official line.

999
01:08:21,356 --> 01:08:24,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Harmonix can confirm that we are not developing Guitar Hero 3.

1000
01:08:24,918 --> 01:08:30,440
[SPEAKER_02]: And that backs up the story from last week about Neversoft, who did the Tony Hawk games, are taking over that.

1001
01:08:31,873 --> 01:08:42,738
[SPEAKER_02]: He also said this, quote, We are instead working on a different music game project, one that is bigger and more ambitious endeavor than we felt we could pursue with the balance of the Guitar Hero franchise.

1002
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:48,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Further specific details on the exact subject and publisher for the game are not yet released.

1003
01:08:48,501 --> 01:08:48,961
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1004
01:08:49,721 --> 01:08:50,641
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm thinking, though?

1005
01:08:50,681 --> 01:08:58,585
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are going, Oh, it's Guitar Hero, or it's Guitar Villain, or it's Drum Hero, or it's Keyboard Hero, or it's a sequel to Amplitude or Frequency.

1006
01:08:59,205 --> 01:09:07,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when this guy uses terms like we are working on a different music game project that is bigger and more ambitious, I think it's bigger than all that.

1007
01:09:07,049 --> 01:09:07,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's different.

1008
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:09,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's something brand new you haven't even thought of yet.

1009
01:09:09,671 --> 01:09:11,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's called Hugh Jass Symphony the game.

1010
01:09:12,072 --> 01:09:16,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just some new concept we don't even know yet until we hear it.

1011
01:09:16,174 --> 01:09:17,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Oonga Boonga.

1012
01:09:18,215 --> 01:09:21,217
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Guns N' Roses the game, an ego bigger than Axl Rose.

1013
01:09:22,597 --> 01:09:27,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, at least Guitar Hero 2 for Xbox Live...

1014
01:09:27,981 --> 01:09:31,203
[SPEAKER_07]: The multiplayer dream has crashed and burned.

1015
01:09:34,205 --> 01:09:39,548
[SPEAKER_07]: The guitar still has the microphone in it, too, but there's no online multiplayer.

1016
01:09:39,648 --> 01:09:45,152
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the modes, co-op face-off, pro face-off modes, are offline only.

1017
01:09:45,172 --> 01:09:47,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of lag, probably.

1018
01:09:47,053 --> 01:09:47,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, y'all.

1019
01:09:48,033 --> 01:09:48,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's gotta be lag.

1020
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty much thinking so.

1021
01:09:51,075 --> 01:09:52,096
[SPEAKER_07]: But I still think it's cool, though.

1022
01:09:53,054 --> 01:10:09,863
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the downloadable packs, because it really gives the experience very similar, I think, to Karaoke Revolution on Xbox, but it really gives the game a really, I'd say, a lot of replayability.

1023
01:10:10,424 --> 01:10:13,325
[SPEAKER_04]: They should just add, well, I'm sure they'll have a leaderboard of some sort.

1024
01:10:13,345 --> 01:10:14,226
[SPEAKER_04]: They need the war pack.

1025
01:10:14,266 --> 01:10:16,607
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what they just need to do, is stick with the leaderboards.

1026
01:10:17,982 --> 01:10:24,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I've given Guitar Hero a little bit of crap on this show just because I don't foam at the mouth over it like everyone else does.

1027
01:10:24,505 --> 01:10:25,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

1028
01:10:25,325 --> 01:10:26,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Guitar Hero.

1029
01:10:26,266 --> 01:10:27,086
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so awesome.

1030
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:28,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually prefer it to Guitar Freaks.

1031
01:10:28,987 --> 01:10:29,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.

1032
01:10:29,527 --> 01:10:34,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Which for somebody with a Bomani, you know, a heart Konami type thing is a huge thing to say.

1033
01:10:34,469 --> 01:10:34,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1034
01:10:34,669 --> 01:10:36,330
[SPEAKER_07]: It bypasses your Bomani boner.

1035
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:37,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.

1036
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,841
[SPEAKER_02]: In the guitar region it does.

1037
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:46,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have five hard-ons somehow if they would make a keyboard game like they did Guitar Hero.

1038
01:10:46,383 --> 01:10:47,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I really would because I love keyboard mania.

1039
01:10:47,763 --> 01:10:50,984
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had five hard-ons, you would probably be Edward Penishands.

1040
01:10:51,965 --> 01:10:52,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

1041
01:10:53,565 --> 01:10:54,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how it would happen.

1042
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:56,466
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a reference I hadn't heard in forever.

1043
01:10:56,866 --> 01:10:59,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I would totally be happy if they would do that, but

1044
01:10:59,983 --> 01:11:02,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I am getting more and more excited about its release on the 360.

1045
01:11:02,744 --> 01:11:04,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pumped for it.

1046
01:11:04,725 --> 01:11:07,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to definitely pick it up when it comes out.

1047
01:11:07,405 --> 01:11:10,006
[SPEAKER_03]: What about DDR on 360?

1048
01:11:10,346 --> 01:11:11,007
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1049
01:11:11,207 --> 01:11:14,148
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some new videos that hit the internet this week, and I think it looks great.

1050
01:11:14,628 --> 01:11:15,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really excited about it.

1051
01:11:15,828 --> 01:11:16,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be an awesome game.

1052
01:11:16,968 --> 01:11:18,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my neighbors are going to hate me.

1053
01:11:19,201 --> 01:11:22,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine are going to hate me too, and I finally need to get my dance pad back from Jamie.

1054
01:11:22,342 --> 01:11:23,623
[SPEAKER_02]: She's had it for like a year and a half.

1055
01:11:24,403 --> 01:11:26,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave it back to you.

1056
01:11:26,504 --> 01:11:28,024
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the steps didn't work.

1057
01:11:28,404 --> 01:11:29,565
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, that was the old dance pad.

1058
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:32,366
[SPEAKER_02]: You took my other one, because remember when there was a Guitar Hero story?

1059
01:11:32,526 --> 01:11:33,386
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the background.

1060
01:11:34,327 --> 01:11:35,407
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you took that back with you.

1061
01:11:35,427 --> 01:11:35,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave it back to you.

1062
01:11:35,927 --> 01:11:36,527
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't have it.

1063
01:11:37,088 --> 01:11:39,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then it's probably in the vault.

1064
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:40,989
[SPEAKER_04]: She forgot to tell you that she sold it for pinball.

1065
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:41,689
[SPEAKER_04]: She probably did.

1066
01:11:41,709 --> 01:11:42,950
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Dan sold it for pinball.

1067
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,250
[SPEAKER_04]: She sold it for a pinball.

1068
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:46,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, we got another freaking pinball machine, by the way.

1069
01:11:46,211 --> 01:11:47,111
[SPEAKER_07]: We got an earth shaker.

1070
01:11:48,212 --> 01:11:48,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1071
01:11:49,147 --> 01:11:50,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even fucking heard of that.

1072
01:11:51,588 --> 01:11:54,270
[SPEAKER_03]: The Rosie O'Donnell pinball machine, the Earthshaker.

1073
01:11:56,511 --> 01:11:58,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Earthshaker is in the same family as Whirlwind.

1074
01:11:58,813 --> 01:12:00,254
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty old school and awesome.

1075
01:12:01,194 --> 01:12:02,715
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those machines that collectors want.

1076
01:12:03,355 --> 01:12:07,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I still want my Doctor Who pinball machine and Dan hasn't accommodated me.

1077
01:12:08,567 --> 01:12:11,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Joshi16 has an interesting line in chat.

1078
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:13,191
[SPEAKER_02]: What would Brian Boitano do?

1079
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:16,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Get all the developers in town and make a game to amaze the noobs.

1080
01:12:16,174 --> 01:12:17,475
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Brian Boitano would do.

1081
01:12:17,655 --> 01:12:18,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to sing it.

1082
01:12:18,355 --> 01:12:18,856
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fantastic.

1083
01:12:19,036 --> 01:12:20,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It failed miserably because I had no voice.

1084
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:23,960
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

1085
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:24,961
[SPEAKER_07]: You have an excuse this time.

1086
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:25,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

1087
01:12:25,702 --> 01:12:30,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is exciting when DarkSakura is letting me have not just one but two buys tonight.

1088
01:12:31,767 --> 01:12:35,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one for Busta Groove 2 and I got another for my voice.

1089
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:36,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.

1090
01:12:37,491 --> 01:12:38,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And you were calling me a bitch.

1091
01:12:40,854 --> 01:12:42,075
[SPEAKER_02]: If the shoe fits.

1092
01:12:42,476 --> 01:12:44,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Very accommodating, Rob.

1093
01:12:45,298 --> 01:12:47,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I only punched you because DMN told me to.

1094
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:48,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, DMN's a bitch too.

1095
01:12:49,181 --> 01:12:51,143
[SPEAKER_07]: He is, but we like his bitchiness.

1096
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:52,984
[SPEAKER_02]: You know there's nothing but heart for the Jamie.

1097
01:12:53,124 --> 01:12:53,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing but heart.

1098
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:55,747
[SPEAKER_07]: A bleeding heart.

1099
01:12:55,867 --> 01:12:57,488
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a heart.

1100
01:12:57,548 --> 01:12:58,529
[SPEAKER_07]: With a knife through it.

1101
01:12:59,363 --> 01:13:08,070
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go to a quick break here and come back in a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio Part B because Jamie and I have to have a hug-a-thon to make up for all the fighting we're doing tonight.

1102
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:11,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to have a hug-a-thon during the break.

1103
01:13:11,813 --> 01:13:14,335
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1104
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:19,980
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you guys listening on our audio archive, also known as podcasting, we'll be back in a couple days, probably about Wednesday-ish, with Part B.

1105
01:13:21,372 --> 01:13:26,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1106
01:13:26,804 --> 01:13:31,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
