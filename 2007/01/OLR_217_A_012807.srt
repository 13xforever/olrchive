Tonight, January 28th, 2007, Wii gets a new channel and rumors circulate of another,

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Sony gets confused about its own game, and a new PC release shatters sales records.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that video game podcast dedicated to video games, the gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm here to help you through the next few hours. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Roar. How you doing? Roar.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Do you need to be fed? Should I throw you some meat?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No, no, no. I just had an awesome, awesome night and a really crappy morning.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm glad to hear about your awesome night and I'm sad to hear about your crappy morning.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sure we'll hear more about it a little later.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The Silver Lancer of Love is in the hospital.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So your car is broke. What happened to your car?

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The bearings have some problems. It's not really the bearings themselves, just their grinding a little bit.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It was in my car last night. You heard it. It was pretty bad.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But we replaced my rotors, calipers, and the brakes.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
See, what we did there was a little radio trick because the listeners don't know that I was in your car last night,

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
but it's a way for me to get you to talk about the problem because they don't know what's wrong with your car.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I know, but I was saying it for the sake of the noise that it was making.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It was pretty bad. It was pretty bad.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The death noise. You want to know what death metal is? Just let your brakes grind.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I thought her tire was flat, actually, is what I thought it was.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And then I got out of the car and I poked all the tires and they were fine. I said,

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're fucked.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Rob probed my car.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I did.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It was great.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're the one who had the probe.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Say hello as well to the always probing tech master, Loki.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hello.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You might want to turn that mic on so you can talk to us tonight.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hello.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hey, how you doing?

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Good.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
217 weeks, we're still having difficulty turning on our microphone.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, I don't check these things.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I turned it off, too. I was the one that did that.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How was your week?

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You had a pretty good week?

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, it was okay.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It was good.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I apologize in advance. I've kind of lost my voice somewhat tonight.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You're going to hear that my voice is kind of scratching.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm doing my best trying to drink some tea and coffee,

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
but those folks that have emailed us or posted on web forums that,

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Rob talks too much on the show.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Rob should shut up once in a while.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You're probably going to get your wish tonight because, as you can hear,

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm strained a little bit.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We've got some emergency for you.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I know. I'm probably going to drink some a little later, but my throat,

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you know, I need hot drinks for the throat, so I've been drinking some green tea.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Boil it.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I will make some coffee later.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Boil it. It will be lovely and nasty.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I might try it. We'll see. I can drink whatever.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, I've been performing with a Rocky Horror Picture Show cast in the Bay Area,

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and I was emceeing the show last night, introducing everybody out in San Francisco

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and just screaming at the top of my lungs.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So that was kind of a stupid thing to do because now I have no voice.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So my bad. What can you do?

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All right. Well, anyway, let's get into some game talk,

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and we'll start it off with how is your gaming week,

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
because we always start off the show with how is your gaming week.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So Dark Soccer, how is your gaming week?

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I played a little bit more Cooking Mama.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I haven't really had time to play much of anything as far as actual games go,

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
although I'm really thinking I'm going to actually stick with Guild Wars

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
for my game of choice.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I might play World of Warcraft, but right now I really don't have time with school.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
My education really is the focus.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But last night I was over here while Rob was off in Rocky Land,

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and I was watching a Miklotov play through Silent Hill 2, which was awesome,

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
but it wasn't scary to me.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There's only, like, one thing that really freaked me out,

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and I don't even remember what that was.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I think it was climbing down the ladder and having Pyramid Head just be there,

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and that spooked me a little bit.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That was really it.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh, and I played some Pinball.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I downloaded a game from my phone, though.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I downloaded Pac-Man Pinball, and it's ass.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What's wrong with it?

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's just boring.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's not very...

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's two fields, and that's it.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is it just a normal Pinball game, like hit left and right?

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Stupid.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Sounds boring.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Like, they should do, like, virtual Pinball for the phone so I can play Black Knight.

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Are there cell phone games you enjoy?

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Because there's only, like, one or two I enjoy.

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I have two that I play, and that's Luminous and Bejeweled.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The only two I play are Luminous and Super Pac-Man.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You know, Super Pac-Man's really hard to play on my phone.

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I would much rather play it, excuse me, on an arcade machine or something,

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
but, you know, it's not bad for on the go.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I did delete virtual Pinball off of my computer

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
because it turned out that I had no space left,

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and I managed to free up 17 gig.

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Jesus.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, yeah.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
17 gigs.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
On a 250 gigabyte hard drive.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's all that, all the TV I'm downloading.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Thanks to certain people who are trying to get me into watching Heroes.

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It worked.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Bite my ass.

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm going to also introduce our invisible fourth guest

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
who's always here with us every week.

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's the chat room, because Orange Lounge Radio,

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
we believe in letting you guys be a part of our program.

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So if you're listening live to us here on this Sunday evening,

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Click on chat, or I believe you can also just go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I think our lovely webmaster, VXJ's next V,

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
set that up quite some time ago,

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and I keep forgetting to announce it that way.

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I want to say hi to the noobs.

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I know Godlike93 introduced himself as a chat room noob tonight,

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
so hi, noob!

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I think I recognize all the other names.

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If I missed any other noobs in chat tonight, I apologize.

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The chat room is pretty much being very foul

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
as to why I have no voice tonight.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
NM64 said Sky ate too many dicks.

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Screw you.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Screw you.

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I just screamed a lot.

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I said the F word repeatedly very loudly,

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and that's why I have no voice today.

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Of course, that doesn't really help that story, does it?

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No, it does not.

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Never mind.

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I think I want to edit that out of the show,

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
but we don't do that.

140
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
All right, Lowkey.

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
How was your gaming week?

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
My gaming week was fun.

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We played...

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I actually finished Resistance finally,

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and the end's kind of okay.

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They're definitely making another one.

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Didn't get a chance to play multiplayer, though.

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I should have done that,

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
but I was too busy playing Crackdown, the demo,

150
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and I played that about six or seven times

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
all the way through,

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
so that's over three hours of Crackdown,

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and it's a fun game.

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's exactly what I was hoping it would be.

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I mean, it's a perfect game for me

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
because you're this overpowered,

157
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
almost like a superhero-type character

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
just abusing the crap out of the citizens

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that live in this one city.

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And then I did get to play last night

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
multiplayer with Jeremy Todd 100,

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and that was fun.

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We just kept busting up

164
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
just how retarded things got.

165
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I kind of couldn't get into the Crackdown demo,

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
but I played it when I didn't have a lot of time

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
to spend with it,

168
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
but you and I need to set a time

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
so you can show me what the hell

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm supposed to do in that game

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
because it looks like it's pretty.

172
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It looks like it might be fun.

173
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
When you actually sit down

174
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and look at some of the detailing,

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I mean, there's a lot of cars and people,

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
which is a lot more than, say,

177
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Saints Row or something like that.

178
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I do like just the amount of detail in it

179
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and just the fact that when you're not

180
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
going around and trying to kill people,

181
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
you can climb a lot of stuff in there,

182
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and that's actually kind of fun also.

183
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's kind of a different aspect of the game.

184
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
They reward you for that too.

185
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
In fact, one of the achievements

186
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
is climbing the tower that you start off in,

187
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and that thing is high.

188
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I managed to get up about,

189
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't know, 20, 30, 40 stories,

190
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and they jumped off of it and landed on a cop.

191
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
To my enjoyment,

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
we both exploded once I hit the ground.

193
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But it was, I don't know,

194
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
it's really, really fun,

195
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
just a lot of killing things.

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm worried that it might be a little short.

197
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm not sure just because it seemed like

198
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you could run through it pretty quick,

199
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and if I've already killed three of the

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
kind of gang leaders in this already in 30 minutes.

201
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Wasn't there some footnote in the demo

202
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
that said it was moving at an accelerated pace?

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Well, the leveling up.

204
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The skills were moving a bit faster,

205
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
but if you spend time with it leveling up,

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
you just kick the crap out of everybody later on,

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
which is fine because it's fun.

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But co-op is definitely where it's at.

209
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I really wish it was more than two players,

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
but even what was kind of weird,

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
though, when you're playing co-op,

212
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
there was lag, but there was lag on my end.

213
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I would move and it would be delayed on my screen,

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
which is kind of weird, but it was fun.

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I liked it, so I can't wait to check out the full game.

216
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Alright, is that it?

217
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I think that's it, yeah.

218
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
My game movie wasn't that exciting either.

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Not a whole lot of new stuff to play.

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I did play Luminous because the Heavenly Stars skin

221
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
came out this week, and of course,

222
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
that's one of my all-time favorite songs in Luminous,

223
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
probably like Shining and then Heavenly Stars.

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So I was very excited to hear that it was coming

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
to the Xbox Live Arcade, and it's really cool.

226
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It looks great on the TV, and it's a good time.

227
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The only thing is that I think the mode that they made for it,

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
like they have a Heavenly Star mode,

229
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
where basically you just play the same song

230
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
over and over and over again, is kind of pointless.

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I think it kind of proves that putting Heavenly Stars

232
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
in the game was a bit of an afterthought.

233
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I think it's kind of weird that Heavenly Stars

234
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
is the only song available right now, too.

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't you remember at E3 there was supposed to be Madonna,

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and they were talking about they were getting together

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Warner Brothers Records to get all these songs.

238
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Where did those show up?

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Because I think it would have been better

240
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
if they released a few of those for, I don't know,

241
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
400 points or whatever, released several of those,

242
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and had a mode for that, like music video mode.

243
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Because the only place that Heavenly Stars really works

244
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
for me is using it in skin edit mode.

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And when I'm playing it in skin edit mode,

246
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't really play the whole song,

247
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
because you move on to the next skin after four levels,

248
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and I'm actually getting better at Luminous,

249
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
so I can usually get through four levels

250
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
at about half the song.

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But I can't complain, it's free.

252
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And I applaud Microsoft and Q Entertainment

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
for trying to correct some of the microtransaction mistakes

254
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
they made by making this content so cheap right now,

255
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and applauding the early adopters and everything.

256
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So it's really hard to complain.

257
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I just think it could have been approached a little better.

258
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's all.

259
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And I'm really looking forward

260
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
to seeing some additional content.

261
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I would not want to see them do the Madonna song,

262
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
where you just play the Madonna mode over and over and over,

263
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
because it's all tracked separately and play history.

264
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And it has separate ranking boards.

265
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's just a little much.

266
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's almost like there's too much.

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Does that make sense?

268
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Let's see.

269
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The other game I played was World of Warcraft.

270
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Honestly, I've been getting sucked back into World of Warcraft.

271
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm a little torn druid now,

272
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
which I know some people are probably like,

273
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I can do that in no time flat.

274
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, you know what?

275
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I have a job.

276
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I have other stuff to do.

277
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But I'm having a lot of fun with it,

278
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and we've got a guild growing.

279
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We have some OLR listeners in it.

280
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We're over on the Ravencrest server.

281
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If you want to join us,

282
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
check out the forums for more details.

283
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We're not called OL Army, though.

284
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's a Silent Hill-based name, actually,

285
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
for whatever reason.

286
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's just Shane's running the guild,

287
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and that's what he picked.

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Miklotov.

289
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You know him as Miklotov on the show.

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That's what he picked.

291
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And it's a good name for a Horde guild.

292
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So, Horde side, Ravencrest.

293
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Visit the Orange Honors Radio forums

294
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
for more detail at orangehonorsradio.com.

295
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And that's it.

296
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's pretty much all my gaming week.

297
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Not anything else major.

298
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Just some other little bits here and there.

299
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I think I might have played a game of Heavy Weapon.

300
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's about it.

301
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh, yeah.

302
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I played Heavy Weapon.

303
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You didn't like it?

304
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No, I thought it was stupid.

305
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I thought it was way better

306
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
than most of the stuff they've been releasing lately.

307
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, that was dumb.

308
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Really?

309
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm glad I didn't buy it.

310
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You know what I didn't get

311
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
that I'm actually surprised I didn't buy

312
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
is Zelda on Virtual Console,

313
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
because it's one of the games

314
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I've really been waiting for,

315
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
but this is seriously what MMOs do to me,

316
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
is that I kind of don't care,

317
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
because I'm like,

318
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
oh, I got to level my druid,

319
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
or else I'm not going to be able

320
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
to stay on top with everybody else.

321
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I need to get out of that mindset.

322
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's not healthy.

323
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I just haven't bought it

324
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
because I already have them.

325
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah.

326
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We did play R-Type.

327
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh, yeah.

328
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's right.

329
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You were over here playing R-Type.

330
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I watched you play that last night.

331
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
How was that?

332
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah.

333
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
God, I suck at it.

334
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I can't play it without the TurboGrafx controller.

335
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Isn't it sad?

336
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't know how many older gamers we have

337
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
that listen to this program.

338
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'd really like to hear from you guys,

339
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
but folks who were in grade school,

340
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
junior high, high school, whatever,

341
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
when 8-bit Nintendo was out,

342
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and I remember being 10, 11, 12 years old

343
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and breezing through some of these games

344
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
like Gradius and stuff,

345
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and I tried to play Gradius the other night.

346
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That is one of the games I played.

347
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I played Gradius on Wii, and I sucked.

348
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I couldn't get past the volcanoes in the first level

349
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
because I swore I was going to do it without cheating.

350
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can't go back and play Nintendo Gradius, though.

351
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I have to play one of the later releases of it.

352
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Does my hand-eye coordination get that bad with age?

353
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You're just old, Rob.

354
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I guess so.

355
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Comments from Chat Room.

356
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Jeremy Todd 1 says,

357
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Everyone has to buy A Link to the Past.

358
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't care who you are or what you do.

359
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Buy it anyway.

360
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
This game is the best game ever.

361
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I agree.

362
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's probably one of the top five games of all time.

363
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Hitstun says,

364
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Heavy Weapon is nice by PopCap standards,

365
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
but that doesn't make it a good game.

366
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I disagree.

367
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
XBSkit adds onto that,

368
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
saying the PopCap standard is the bottom of the barrel

369
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
next to Flash games.

370
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't know.

371
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
There's some pretty crappy stuff on Xbox Live

372
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
outside the PopCap stuff.

373
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
At least there's some playability there.

374
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't know.

375
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I disagree.

376
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't think PopCap's the best thing ever, OMG,

377
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
but I think some of the stuff they put out

378
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
is pretty decent.

379
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Bob Coffee says,

380
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Don't give in to World of Warcraft.

381
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Too late.

382
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Alpha Canagram says,

383
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Skye, I love Heavenly Star.

384
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm just annoyed that I can't turn off the sound effects

385
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
because sometimes I want to hear the actual song while playing.

386
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, you know how in Luminous,

387
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
you know with the songs in the background,

388
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
the little rotating the shapes will make a noise,

389
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and clearing a block off the screen will make a noise?

390
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Some of that does get in the way of the song,

391
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
but I don't find it.

392
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I liked for Shining, though.

393
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Wow.

394
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah, and Shining, it was incredible.

395
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't mind it in Heavenly Star,

396
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and I think in Hollaback Girl it's funny,

397
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
if you have the PSP one.

398
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
By the way, I saw Luminous Plus on PS2 for sale the other day,

399
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and I remember what you were telling me

400
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
about how it went down in price, right?

401
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Luminous Plus on PS2?

402
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah, it's $19.99.

403
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It shouldn't be out, though.

404
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's not coming out until way later.

405
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
No, they had it on shelves at a place I went to at a GameStop,

406
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
which you're usually pretty good about.

407
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, Luminous Plus doesn't come out until the end of next month.

408
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
For real?

409
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I should have bought it.

410
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I swear, they had like 40 copies

411
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
sitting right there on the shelf behind the little thing.

412
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Luminous Plus.

413
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Huh.

414
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Maybe something happened.

415
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, they shouldn't have that yet.

416
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's weird.

417
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm going to check the web and see if it...

418
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Maybe if they changed the price, they bumped up the release date.

419
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't really want to get it on PS2, though.

420
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's too many versions.

421
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I have Xbox Live.

422
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's good enough.

423
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Then again, it would depend on the songs.

424
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Do they have some good licensed song in Luminous Plus,

425
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
or is it just a port of the PSP version?

426
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I think it's just a port of the PSP version.

427
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Then forget it.

428
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Forget it.

429
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't care, then.

430
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
All right, let's go on and get into some other stuff for tonight's show.

431
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
We want to talk about some housekeeping tonight.

432
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Not a whole lot going on with our show itself.

433
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
We want to talk about some of the other shows on our station.

434
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Travis Donovan Live will not be live this upcoming Saturday,

435
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
so I don't know if there's going to be a rerun going on

436
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
or what exactly is going to be happening with that.

437
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Also interesting to note, I guess on his last program,

438
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Travis announced his candidacy for president in 2008.

439
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So if you want to vote for an alternative,

440
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I suppose you could always vote for Travis.

441
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So if you want more details, listen to his show.

442
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Saturday nights at 7 o'clock, but not this upcoming week.

443
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
DMN is going to call us later in the show

444
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
because they scored a huge interview for this week.

445
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm pretty jealous.

446
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And Jamie, you are going to be pissed when you find out who it is.

447
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's all I have to say.

448
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You're going to be pissed that they're not on this show.

449
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Okay.

450
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You're going to want to reach through the screen and punch DMN.

451
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Okay.

452
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's pretty good.

453
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He'll call in later in the program.

454
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Okay.

455
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So keep an eye on that at www.orangelandtrader.com.

456
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Okay.

457
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Okay, I'm going to shove this mic up your ass now, okay?

458
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Hey, Rob.

459
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What?

460
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Rob.

461
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What?

462
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Hi.

463
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You expected me to say Rob a bunch of times, didn't you?

464
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I know.

465
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Well, you know what?

466
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Let's let the joke die.

467
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Step away from the joke.

468
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No.

469
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
All right.

470
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
On a serious note, Dark Sakura wanted to start off tonight's program a little bit,

471
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and we promised we wouldn't bring this story up again,

472
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
but Dark Sakura had something she wanted to say,

473
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
she wanted to talk about last week and us talking about it,

474
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and I'll just turn it over to her.

475
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So, Dark Sakura, what do you want to say?

476
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah, about the whole two-gallon water drowning lady.

477
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Jennifer Strange, yes?

478
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah, sorry.

479
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Hold your Wii for a week, KD&D.

480
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I could only remember her last name for some reason.

481
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay.

482
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Well, it was pretty strange.

483
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I got all of three emails about it.

484
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
One of them was just stupid, and I immediately disregarded it

485
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
because if you want to make a valid point,

486
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
don't start off by calling people names and being an idiot

487
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
then I don't respect you and I will never pay attention to anything you say.

488
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Was it like a fuck you, you fucking fuck type of email?

489
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, I'm like, you're an idiot, next.

490
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I did, however, receive one that really, I want to say,

491
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
was a well-thought-out letter, and I appreciate it,

492
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and just because, and I'm going to go ahead and say this,

493
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I am, God, chat room, knock it off, shit.

494
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh, God.

495
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Anyway, Rob, you should just kick everybody.

496
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I do, I do.

497
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Do your statement.

498
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Anyway, what I was going to say before the chat room started acting like they had Tourette's

499
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
is that, you know, I couldn't go on when I was wrong.

500
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I even went back and said, yeah, I don't think it was necessarily a matter of deserving it,

501
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
but I come from the point of view of accountability for what you do,

502
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
of people having a free will.

503
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I apologize to anyone who might have been offended,

504
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
but my point of view still stands.

505
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's a matter of, you know, looking at how much warning was given.

506
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
There's still a lot of ambiguity regarding it,

507
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
so until I have proof that she was held down to the floor

508
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and they forced water down her throat, I'm not going to feel as sorry for her.

509
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I feel sorry for the kids.

510
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I feel sorry for the family, but she did choose to do it,

511
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
so that's the point I'm standing on, and end of story,

512
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
but I do offer a public apology to anyone who might have been offended by my anger

513
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
because, honestly, if something like that happened to me,

514
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I would not want to be made a victim.

515
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I would want my accountability to go on record

516
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
because, you know, if I had to go ride a roller coaster

517
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and I know the roller coaster could fall over by, you know, tornado,

518
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and the tornado strikes and the roller coaster falls over,

519
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I know when I die my horrible flaming death

520
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
that it was my choice to get on the roller coaster in the first place.

521
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But what a way to go.

522
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I know. Wouldn't that be awesome?

523
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But a friend of mine equated it, though, with, you know,

524
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
if you're a woman going out at midnight to 7-11,

525
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
there's a chance that you can get pounced in the alleyway and raped.

526
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Well, that's the difference.

527
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
She wasn't forced down onto the ground and forced water down her throat.

528
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
She actually chose to do it after there was warning calling in,

529
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
after they were saying, Do you feel sick?

530
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Do you need to stop people talking about it?

531
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So that's my point of view on it.

532
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
My blame...

533
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
See, people keep using blame.

534
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Blame is stupid. I hate that word.

535
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't blame her.

536
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I just think that she had a choice, and that's what I'm saying.

537
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I just don't think that people should discount the fact

538
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
that she did have free will involved.

539
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And that's what people are doing.

540
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Hopefully we can all get past this story

541
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
because I know, you know, I'm kind of sick of hearing about it,

542
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
especially living here, because keep in mind,

543
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
this was in our backyard, and we are hearing about this nonstop.

544
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's in our paper every day, some type of new development.

545
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And top of that, I talked it over with several of my co-workers,

546
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
lots of my friends, and everyone's saying,

547
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Did we learn about this in middle school?

548
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You know, if you saturate your body with water without replacing sodium,

549
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
your brain's not going to function.

550
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That you learn in middle school.

551
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And for me, my whole thing is just that I don't...

552
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, the radio station fully, they are fully responsible.

553
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Well, not say fully responsible,

554
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
but they should be the ones punished for the event, not her.

555
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I think that, you know, what happened to her is a horrible tragedy.

556
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But I think that people should just not say she had no part in the blame.

557
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I hate the word blame.

558
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I just think that people should understand she did choose to participate.

559
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't think this should have happened to her.

560
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't think any of that should have happened.

561
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But just let her be accountable.

562
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Let her be posthumously accountable and not the big bad victim,

563
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
because we're a country of victims and it's sickening.

564
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
All right.

565
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Well, I'm going to try and keep the show moving,

566
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
but I do want to say this, just kind of a friendly reminder that,

567
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
you know, Orange Andrea, part of the reason why we're here

568
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
is to let gamers all have their voice,

569
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
whether you may agree with it or not.

570
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And sometimes it's on a very superficial level

571
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
where it's Nintendo versus Sony versus Microsoft.

572
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And, you know, sometimes we call Sony executives' names

573
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and you may not agree with that.

574
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And sometimes we may be praising Nintendo or Microsoft things

575
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
that you don't agree with or whatever it may be.

576
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
In this case it was something that wasn't so superficial,

577
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
something that really struck a nerve.

578
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But keep in mind that part of the reason why the three of us are here

579
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and part of what Jamie brings to the show and Loki brings to the show

580
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and I bring to the show is that we have pretty blunt opinions

581
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and controversial opinions sometimes.

582
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And you may not always agree with it,

583
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
but we do have the right to have that voice, nevertheless.

584
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You know, I don't agree with Jamie 100% on this particular thing,

585
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
but she has the right to say it and I defend her right to say it.

586
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So I also want to kind of get that out because, you know,

587
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
if you're going to email me saying Jamie should be off the show,

588
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
that's not going to do any good.

589
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Did someone do that?

590
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You were CC'd on it.

591
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh, was it that?

592
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah, no, no, we'll talk later.

593
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But it was, you know, it's kind of one of those things.

594
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah, I'm going to be off of the show that I helped make.

595
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That's not going to happen.

596
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That's stupid.

597
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
She, you know, even if I disagree with her,

598
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I think part of the lure of the show is that I can hear her thoughts,

599
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
you know, and Jamie.

600
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Dude, Firebomb had pointed it out.

601
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
He said, but she's a woman and she therefore has no opinion.

602
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Why is it?

603
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And the only complaints I got were from men.

604
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Well, to be fair, we probably have just more men than women

605
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
that listen to this show and that's just the culture we're in.

606
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But I noticed, though, in general that any time I could say something

607
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
and Matt could say the exact same thing,

608
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
but I'm the one that gets the emails about it that I should go, you know, be quiet.

609
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You know what?

610
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Hello, universe.

611
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm a woman.

612
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I have an opinion and you're going to fucking shut up and listen to it.

613
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So fuck you.

614
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's how I feel.

615
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But at the same time, you have the right to express your rebuttal arguments

616
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
with your intelligent emails and, you know,

617
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
phone calls we do later in this program.

618
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Jamie's not totally shut off to hearing what else you guys might have to say.

619
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
No, seriously.

620
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You present your rebuttal to me in an intelligent way.

621
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm more than happy to discuss it with you.

622
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I think we can agree to disagree, but I would love to hear.

623
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I invite anybody.

624
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
If you've got an opposite opinion to what I have, I love debate.

625
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh, my God.

626
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So prove it.

627
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Bring it.

628
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
All right.

629
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I will discuss with you until the cows come home.

630
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Let's see what we can debate about this week by moving into some gaming news

631
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and we're going to start it off tonight with Loki's got some more exclusives for us.

632
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You just keep getting the good shit, don't you, Loki?

633
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I keep trying.

634
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, for the record also, Luminous Plus is listed on GameStop's site

635
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
as coming out on the 27th of February.

636
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Something's up.

637
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
God, I should go back and grab it.

638
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Where did I see it?

639
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh, I know where it was now.

640
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Maybe I'll go grab it.

641
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Anyways, so, yeah, we had a bunch of stories

642
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and not just, you know, release dates and stuff.

643
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
For example, we had a follow-up to, you know, a game we talked about.

644
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We announced originally on episode 206, High School Musical the Game,

645
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
which, you know, to me, I mean, I wasn't too interested about this.

646
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It is coming out for the Wii and PlayStation 2.

647
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's based on the Disney Channel like musical that they apparently selling very well on DVD and stuff.

648
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But what's actually kind of made it more interesting for me

649
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and as we put on the website earlier this week,

650
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
High School Musical the Game is actually going to be featuring a microphone peripheral for the Wii.

651
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Which is kind of neat.

652
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So apparently you're going to be singing karaoke.

653
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm not sure if it's going to be an actual, you know, its own unit,

654
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
like its own controller,

655
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
or if it's going to be something that plugs into the bottom of the Wii mote.

656
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But either way, you're going to be singing karaoke with this thing.

657
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It is going to be coming out now in August, $69.99 for the bundle.

658
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And that's kind of interesting to see, you know,

659
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
some actual companies making some attachments for the Wii

660
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
other than say, you know, some stupid steering wheel like the Ubisoft games.

661
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
But that's kind of neat.

662
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Other stuff we announced this week,

663
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
including there's going to be a brand new PSP game coming out

664
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
based on the Girls Gone Wild franchise.

665
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And it's actually a pool themed game.

666
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Originally it was going to be called Pocket Pool by itself.

667
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And then they picked up the Girls Gone Wild license.

668
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Now, Eidos is producing it,

669
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and basically it's going to be your standard billiards game,

670
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
but you unlock nudie pictures.

671
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So, you know, who doesn't like some good nudie pictures?

672
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Which is hilarious.

673
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I think that's a great name for the game, by the way.

674
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That's hilarious.

675
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And then finally, we've got some, well actually some other stuff.

676
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Ubisoft, they announced Brothers in Arms War Stories for the DS.

677
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Now, I've been reading some other sites out there saying that,

678
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
you know, they've heard the same thing,

679
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
but they're getting their info from the ESRB website

680
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
because it was listed on there.

681
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But either way, it is coming for the DS.

682
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's going to be coming out on June 13th for $29.99.

683
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And it should be some interesting stuff.

684
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Also, there is a little bit of elaboration for Driver 76,

685
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
as I mentioned a few episodes back.

686
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's going to be kind of based on the Driver Parallel Lines series,

687
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
but it's going to be set two years previous

688
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and it's going to feature all new missions and stuff like that.

689
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So that's going to be kind of cool.

690
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And then, of course, Sega's Virtua Fighter V,

691
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and this is also, you know,

692
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
the street date's been listed on other sites,

693
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
but according to Sega themselves,

694
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
they signed a six-month exclusive contract with Sony

695
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
for the PlayStation exclusivity of it.

696
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Where did you hear this?

697
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Because I haven't heard this anywhere else about this six-month deal.

698
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I heard this actually from Sega

699
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
because they came into our Dallas office

700
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
to do kind of their lineup of stuff,

701
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and I was questioning them about dates and stuff.

702
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
At least I was emailing our buyer about dates,

703
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and she said that they're on a six-month exclusive deal.

704
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So I know GameStop had a tentative date on their website as,

705
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
what was it, August something.

706
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It was towards the end of August,

707
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
but it would be six months from when it's actually released

708
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
in February for the PlayStation 3.

709
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So that's kind of interesting.

710
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And that was the exclusive news we had.

711
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

712
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And then, of course, my favorite one here,

713
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
the two Konami Wii titles that are going to be coming out in March.

714
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And now it's Wing Island and Kororinpa Marble Mania

715
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
is going to be coming out as well for the Wii.

716
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Both are going to be pretty reasonably priced,

717
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
only $39.99 for each.

718
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Both coming out on the 28th of March.

719
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So I'm sure we'll have more info about that next week

720
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
after Konami's Gamers' Day.

721
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But that was some interesting stuff.

722
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Wait, was that Koro as in, like, C-H-O-R-O?

723
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
K-O-R-O.

724
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I want another Koro game.

725
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Anyways, there was some other stuff,

726
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
other announcements regarding dates as well.

727
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
This one, Rob, you're going to like.

728
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Elevator Action for the Wii is coming out on June 13th.

729
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That's a pretty rad arcade game.

730
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'd be curious to see what they do with it.

731
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah.

732
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And, of course, Blade Storm's been delayed on the PlayStation 3

733
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
to June 15th as well.

734
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Call of Juarez for the Xbox 360 is coming out on June 15th.

735
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And Turok for the PlayStation 3 and 360

736
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
also going to be coming out in September on the 12th.

737
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So lots of good stuff.

738
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And I'll, of course, be posting more dates

739
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
to our Under the Radar thread that we have on the forums.

740
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So keep an eye on that.

741
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I will.

742
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
All right.

743
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Well, speaking of the Wii,

744
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I guess we're getting elevator action pretty soon.

745
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And now we're getting rumors about new channels

746
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
that could be coming to the Wii.

747
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I mean, when the Wii went out and they first announced the Wii,

748
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
we all knew we were going to be getting, you know,

749
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
the news channel, the internet channel at some point.

750
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Well, now there are rumors of a game channel,

751
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and this was spurred by remarks that were made by John Lee,

752
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
who is the Hudson Entertainment Director of Marketing.

753
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
He didn't say anything too specific about it,

754
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
but when he was asked about downloadable games for the Wii,

755
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
this was his quote.

756
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Quote, however, in the future,

757
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
you should rephrase that question to,

758
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
are there any plans to launch original content

759
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
on some downloadable service on the Wii?

760
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And you might get a different answer.

761
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Now Nintendo, of course, said, you know,

762
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Wii cannot confirm what format the new content will be delivered.

763
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
There will be original games at the Wii shop eventually.

764
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But it could be interesting,

765
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
because this is launching speculation

766
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
that it might be just a whole new channel

767
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
to separate classic Nintendo titles

768
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
and these, you know, downloadable titles

769
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
in a new channel by itself.

770
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Why couldn't he just not be a jackass about the whole thing?

771
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You mean...

772
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
What do you mean?

773
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm sorry.

774
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I can't answer your question

775
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and ask me the correct question.

776
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Riddle me this.

777
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I think, you know, there are NDAs and things,

778
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
so I think he's trying to think of a clever way around it.

779
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I don't think he's a jackass.

780
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But that, I mean, they're just like, it's like,

781
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
you know, if you're asking, say, for example,

782
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
imagine you're asking Sony

783
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
when the PlayStation 3 is going to be coming out in the UK

784
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
or something like that.

785
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You're like, so, uh,

786
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
when are you guys going to be releasing the,

787
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
you know, PlayStation 3 in the UK?

788
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm sorry you did not ask the correct question.

789
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I have a question in the form of a walrus.

790
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Perhaps if you asked,

791
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
when is it coming to England?

792
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I might have answered you,

793
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
but because you did not,

794
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
you will not be told the answer.

795
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I mean, that's just fucking annoying.

796
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's just, you know, answer the damn question.

797
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Fireboom asks an interesting question

798
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
out of left field here a little bit.

799
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It says, weren't we supposed to have different colors

800
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
for Wii consoles by now?

801
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I want to say I read a story.

802
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's not in our show world tonight,

803
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
but I want to say I read a story

804
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
somewhere on the internet earlier this week

805
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
that said, yeah, they were going to do different colors,

806
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
but since they're having trouble keeping the gray ones

807
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
on shelves as it is,

808
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
that the new colors are going to be quite some ways off.

809
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
New colors will be something they do

810
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
when they want to sell more systems.

811
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
They're not going to do it right now.

812
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
They're not having trouble selling the systems yet,

813
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
so just wait until the systems start to die off a little bit,

814
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
start getting, you know, into the same situation

815
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
as the 360 and PS3 right now,

816
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and then they'll throw out the extra colors

817
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
and do all these shit that you don't need for it.

818
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's very interesting to see how the Wii is,

819
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
you know, I'm just thinking about this

820
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
because I read it today.

821
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
One of my friends on LiveJournal,

822
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
my old roommate, who wasn't much of a gamer,

823
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
remember the very first OLR studio,

824
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
my roommate there?

825
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Okay, he wasn't that super into games.

826
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
He always kind of thought the show he did was kind of weird,

827
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
but he thought it was cool, right?

828
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Well, he made this post in LiveJournal today

829
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
about how he wants a Wii

830
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
because he played one over the weekend.

831
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
He thought it was awesome,

832
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and he says, I don't really get into video games,

833
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
but the Wii was fun.

834
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It was very interesting to read things like that.

835
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's so interesting to read from the not,

836
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
you know, to take some time away from the game blog

837
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
because once in a while to read what other people have to say.

838
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's just very interesting.

839
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I think Nintendo's very, very happy at reaction like that.

840
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
That was their goal, was it not?

841
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I suppose it was.

842
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Well, you know, we have actually a little bit more

843
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
coming from Nintendo, specifically about the channels.

844
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
The news channel, there's a pretty good review of it, I found.

845
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Have you...

846
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I've played with the news channel.

847
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I played with that a little bit this week.

848
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It was fun.

849
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Well, basically, the news channel,

850
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and this is a couple things that I like about it.

851
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It seems like it's got pretty easy browsing to it.

852
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Brings up your local news based on your area.

853
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You can click on globe, though,

854
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and it shows you where you are in relation to the rest of the world.

855
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It's pretty cool.

856
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You can also, there's a slide show.

857
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
There's, you know, you can see the headlines come through

858
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
at the bottom half, and you pick wherever.

859
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
You bring up any of the stories that come up on the slide show

860
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:48,000
by pressing A. It's pretty easy to follow, I think.

861
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's looking like they said that the relaunch of it

862
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
is going to be later this year,

863
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and it's going to be free and offer more regions available for viewing.

864
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But so far, it seems so, you know, so far so good, pretty much.

865
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I actually like it quite a bit.

866
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I like it more than I like the forecast channel.

867
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But my only suggestion for the news channel would be that,

868
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
you know how the forecast channel has the temperature and things

869
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
in the Wii browser?

870
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Like, you don't have to launch the forecast channel

871
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
just to see the temperature,

872
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
although it's horribly out of date, at least for this region.

873
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Like, it never updates after midnight or 6 a.m.

874
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Like, it never updates for the rest of the day.

875
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But I kind of wish, like, you could,

876
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
like, if I'm just quickly clicking through channels

877
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
to get to a virtual console game or something,

878
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
it would be cool to see, like,

879
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
what some of the top headlines are in the news channel at the moment.

880
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Because that might make me go,

881
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
oh, I want to click there and read it.

882
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Because if you think about it,

883
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
that's kind of how your email is set up, right?

884
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
If you use Yahoo mail or you use Hotmail

885
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
or one of those web clients for your email,

886
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
hell, even Gmail, you have links to news articles usually

887
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
or RSS feeds that run kind of along the side of your email.

888
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And sometimes that's what makes me stop and go,

889
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
oh, that sounds interesting.

890
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That's actually why I stopped using most of those

891
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
because my email is through my friend Julie's server

892
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and I don't have to worry about any of that.

893
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But I don't mind it on, like, you know,

894
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
because I use Firefox ad block and stuff.

895
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
But, yeah, when you use Yahoo mail,

896
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
it shows you some of the top headlines, which is kind of cool.

897
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I stopped using Yahoo mail just because of that.

898
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I like to have my news where I can, you know,

899
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
if I'm going for news, I'm going specifically for news.

900
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
That's why the first thing that I have pull up is my Yahoo page

901
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and I have my world events and all that listing.

902
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I would really, though, this is my hope.

903
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm not quite sure what their news source is,

904
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
but I hope that they don't go with...

905
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Associated Press.

906
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
They have a two-year agreement with Associated Press.

907
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Okay.

908
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Well, I still, I'm very leery about most of our press publications

909
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
just because there's a lot of bias, a lot of sensationalism in modern press.

910
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Well, you know what I thought was hilarious is, you know,

911
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
of course one of the first places I went to look for stories locally

912
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
once I got to the Globe was Sacramento.

913
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And guess what the top news story was in the Sacramento region

914
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
on the news channel was about the, you know,

915
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
again, here's more news and to hold your Wii for a Wii thing

916
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
as if we could have more.

917
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I was reading BBC news and saw crap on it.

918
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah, I know. It's everywhere.

919
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I usually go from my world news to a BBC world.

920
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So, of course that's on it,

921
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
but I thought it would be interesting that you're reading that on the Wii,

922
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
you know, but what was even more interesting

923
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
is that when you looked in the technology and entertainment section,

924
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
there was a story the first day it launched

925
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
about the PlayStation 3 launch being announced in Europe,

926
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
which I thought was very interesting.

927
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So, it was interesting that that was on the news channel.

928
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Yeah.

929
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So, and you could even see a picture of a PlayStation 3

930
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
and it was just, it was kind of one of those moments.

931
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
The very first time you see the Nintendo and Sega logos

932
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
on the screen together, like when you boot up F-Zero,

933
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
it was one of those moments,

934
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
like looking at a picture of a PlayStation 3 on your Wii.

935
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It was weird.

936
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It was very awkward.

937
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I like you with your Elibits icon on Xbox Live.

938
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
That's true.

939
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
My friends list icon on Xbox Live is an Elibit,

940
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
so I guess that's not the first time.

941
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And, you know, at one time my background was a picture of Mario Kart

942
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
because that was when I was playing around

943
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
with using backgrounds from the computer.

944
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So, just fun to do little things like that, I suppose.

945
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I like irony.

946
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Anyways, speaking about the Wii,

947
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
there's going to be some fun stuff coming to the Virtual Console soon.

948
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And one of the biggest games coming, you know, to the Virtual Console

949
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
and only to, you know, Trump, you know, was it last week's,

950
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
you know, Link to the Past.

951
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Legend of Zelda the Ocarina of Time is going to be heading

952
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
to at least the Japanese Virtual Console in February.

953
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's going to be slated for 1200 points

954
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and of course it's going to make it to the United States

955
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
shortly after the Japanese one, if not the same day.

956
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But, that's awesome.

957
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Not interested.

958
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Okay, well that's awesome for other people.

959
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm not interested either because I had it on GameCube for the longest time.

960
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Exactly. And the Wii can play GameCube games.

961
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So, what's the point?

962
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Like, you know, I understand.

963
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Sometimes people go like,

964
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
well Rob, then why do you bother downloading anything on there at all

965
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
when you can just use emulators?

966
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Okay, because I can't use emulators on my TV with a wireless remote.

967
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm just too lazy to set that thing up

968
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and I like the authentic experience.

969
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
But using that little GameCube disc with the Zelda game on it

970
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
is a pretty authentic experience.

971
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yeah.

972
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So, I don't get the point of downloading it.

973
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm going to be downloading Mario Kart.

974
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But here's the best part though.

975
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You know, when this game does come out, you know,

976
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
it's going to be great and people are going to download it and stuff.

977
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Then later on down the line, remember how, you know,

978
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
they were talking about, oh yeah, well we can do a line of games,

979
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
you know, and thank the Game Boy Advance here, you know,

980
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
when they released the old Nintendo games for it again.

981
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
We can do a line of games that are just GameCube and maybe Nintendo 64 games

982
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
ported over with the controls for the Wii.

983
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So, you would have like, you know, Mario Kart Double Dash or whatever

984
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
ported over like in being sold for say $29.99 or something like that

985
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
with just, you know, no changes whatsoever

986
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
other than the controls for the Wii.

987
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Watch this kind of happen or they release some sort of, you know,

988
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
collector's edition of all the Zelda games or something again.

989
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm reading what the chat room has to say on this.

990
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Jeremy Todd 1 says, I have played and beat Ocarina of Time

991
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
a few too many times now.

992
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I beat it on 64, I beat it on the GameCube,

993
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I beat it on the computer, whistles,

994
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and like OLR said, I have the GameCube game so I can just play that.

995
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
GS68 would like to point out, you know,

996
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
playing the Ocarina is kind of hell with the C-Stick,

997
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
which does make sense because you didn't have the buttons on the GameCube,

998
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
you had that stick.

999
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Well, it doesn't stop there.

1000
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
There's lots of titles coming to Japan, not just Ocarina of Time,

1001
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
but lots of cool stuff coming out in Japan.

1002
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Now, keep in mind not all of these have American counterparts,

1003
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
but some of them do and so you'll probably be seeing those before too long.

1004
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Mighty Bomb Jack from the NES is coming out there soon.

1005
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Galaga, again, these are Japan dates, coming out on the NES.

1006
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Kirby's Adventure coming out on the NES.

1007
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Kamaitachi no Yoru is coming out for the Super Nintendo.

1008
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Megami Tensei, Super Goals and Ghosts,

1009
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Sangokushi 4,

1010
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Bare Knuckles, Streets of Rage for Genesis,

1011
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Beyond Oasis, also on the Genesis,

1012
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Vector Man for the Genesis,

1013
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Sword of Vermillion on the Genesis,

1014
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Vigilante on TurboGrafx-16,

1015
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Chu Man Fu,

1016
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yokai Doshuki,

1017
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Wonder Momo also all coming out on TurboGrafx-16.

1018
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So, sounds like there's a lot of cool stuff coming out on your Japanese Virtual Console

1019
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and many of those titles that do have American versions

1020
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
we'll probably be seeing those before too long.

1021
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Bare Knuckle, that brings back memories

1022
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
because we picked up the Japanese cart

1023
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and used a converter on it to play on our Nomad

1024
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
and it played it as Streets of Rage.

1025
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It was a Bare Knuckle cart.

1026
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
That's weird, how did it know that?

1027
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Sometimes they'll do that.

1028
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Actually, a lot of the Neo Geo games will have a Switch.

1029
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You can play them in either version.

1030
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Our Japanese Samurai Spirits 2 is Samurai Shodown 2

1031
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and it'll play depending on what mode we have it in.

1032
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
You know what I'd like to see Nintendo do

1033
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and this is going to seem completely out of left field,

1034
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
but I would like to see them release some Japanese games

1035
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
that never got released here.

1036
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You know, and just...

1037
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I mean, I guess...

1038
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Well, okay, that's a little obscure,

1039
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
but I'm thinking Earthbound on the NES,

1040
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Mother Zero or whatever it's...

1041
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
The original Mother, which we call Earthbound Zero

1042
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
on that translated ROM...

1043
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
No, it wasn't a translated ROM,

1044
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
it was a ROM that somebody bought on eBay,

1045
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
which is a prototype.

1046
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So it's like that game is floating around there, half done.

1047
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Wouldn't that be awesome if that came out on the Virtual Console?

1048
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I agree.

1049
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I don't know.

1050
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Maybe that's just too much work,

1051
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
but I can't believe that Nintendo isn't making an arm and a leg

1052
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
off a lot of these Virtual Console games.

1053
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
We need the freakin' TurboGrafx Twinbee.

1054
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Oh, we'll see.

1055
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And Parodius.

1056
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
We need Parodius.

1057
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
We'll see.

1058
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Anyway.

1059
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Well, something that will make a lot of people happy,

1060
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
speaking of Virtual Console,

1061
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
is Mario Kart 64 is going to be on Virtual Console in Europe.

1062
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
It's actually the second Nintendo 64 title

1063
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
to be on the European Virtual Console.

1064
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's a really... It's Mario Kart.

1065
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
There's really not much else to be said about it,

1066
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
but there's also a notice that Soldier Blade,

1067
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
which is a TurboGrafx-16 game,

1068
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
is also going to be available for 600 points.

1069
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Well, everybody's getting in on the Mario Kart love now.

1070
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It's nice to see another Nintendo 64 title get up there, though.

1071
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And I'll tell you, Mario Kart on the 64

1072
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
was the best version next to the original, I'd say.

1073
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You know what we need is Pokemon Snail.

1074
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Toad's Highway.

1075
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
End of story.

1076
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Pokemon Snap.

1077
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I would agree.

1078
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Pokemon Snap would be pretty awesome.

1079
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
How about Superman 64?

1080
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Oh, fuck no.

1081
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
That was so funny.

1082
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
That'd be kind of cool, though.

1083
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Blast Corpse or something like that.

1084
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Or even, you know...

1085
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Pokemon Puzzle League.

1086
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Actually, GoldenEye 64.

1087
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You know what you'd probably like?

1088
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Dream On.

1089
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's a rare game.

1090
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I know.

1091
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Once they start doing the light gun games and stuff,

1092
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
they should do...

1093
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Super Scope.

1094
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Well, Super Scope would be awesome,

1095
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
but the Pokemon Snap or something like that.

1096
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
How awesome was the Super Scope?

1097
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It was a bazooka, for God's sake.

1098
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It was awesome.

1099
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I know.

1100
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It was hard.

1101
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I remember sitting playing,

1102
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
because I had a Super Scope when they came out,

1103
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
sitting there playing freaking Blastress

1104
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
for long enough to wear out the battery in the Super Scope.

1105
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
That was six hours.

1106
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Oh, I have some folks agreeing with me in chat room.

1107
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Alex says, Pokemon Puzzle League FTW.

1108
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Rama says, I like Pokemon Puzzle League.

1109
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I know what's up.

1110
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I want a Super Scope just to put on my desk.

1111
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
That would be cool.

1112
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I have one.

1113
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You'll probably get one at the auction.

1114
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I have one.

1115
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Do you want it?

1116
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Sure.

1117
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I'll take a Super Scope.

1118
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I'll see if we can find it.

1119
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
We actually have a Menacer somewhere, too.

1120
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Put it on my desk.

1121
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
The attachment that hooks onto the Master System gun.

1122
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
JVmon's leading a chant in the chat room for Yoshi Safari

1123
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
with the Wii remote.

1124
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
That might be kind of fun.

1125
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
We need more Metal Slug.

1126
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
What are you talking about?

1127
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
There's the fucking anthologies out on Wii.

1128
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I know.

1129
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I have it.

1130
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
But we need more Metal Slug, anyway.

1131
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
No, we don't.

1132
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yes, we do.

1133
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I like how we did that in unison.

1134
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Great minds think like me.

1135
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
OK, no, WrestleMania 2000 should definitely

1136
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
be on Virtual Console.

1137
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Anyways, so speaking of the Wii, there's

1138
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
one website that's actually creating sculptures of Miis,

1139
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
which is kind of cool.

1140
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
AllisonQMcCarthy.com.

1141
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Allison, anyway, she's creating some custom Wii sculptures

1142
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
based on your Miis.

1143
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Right now, the demand's really big,

1144
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
so she has an email list that you can sign up on.

1145
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But the first few ones, she's actually

1146
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
going to be doing some generic ones.

1147
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
She'll be posting them on eBay, see how they sell and stuff.

1148
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But possibly later on, you're going

1149
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
to be able to get, I guess, your own custom Miis, which

1150
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
would be awesome, because I want to.

1151
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
They should totally have a service like that.

1152
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I mean, think about it.

1153
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
They're doing the same thing for Spore,

1154
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
where you can create your own custom stuff.

1155
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
That made me think of the other thing,

1156
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
like you can put your monsters for Spore.

1157
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Dude, I'm looking at this.

1158
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I can do these.

1159
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Well, then do it.

1160
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Make me one.

1161
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I still have to do.

1162
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I have two more dolphins to face up on.

1163
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You're a woman.

1164
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You can make things, right?

1165
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Hey, Rob, bite my ass.

1166
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
But anyways.

1167
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Are they like little bobbleheads?

1168
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Sort of.

1169
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
They sort of look like a bobblehead.

1170
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
They look like they're made from stuff at Michael's.

1171
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I think it looks cute.

1172
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
They are cute, but it's just a cool thing.

1173
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Make me one.

1174
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah, the stuff that's on these, you can buy the bits at Michael's.

1175
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Why don't you put up or shut up, Jamie?

1176
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
No, seriously.

1177
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I'll do one once I have time between classes.

1178
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Awesome.

1179
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I got free stuff.

1180
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So definitely keep an eye on AllisonQMcCarthy.com.

1181
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah, maybe square yourself your own Mii.

1182
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
How much do they charge you for the Miis?

1183
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Not saying yet because I think she's just starting off with this and got picked up by

1184
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
everywhere, and now they're getting inundated with requests.

1185
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Poor thing.

1186
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
One of the downsides to getting digged.

1187
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Was that on dig?

1188
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I'm pretty sure it was.

1189
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I think it probably was.

1190
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
All right.

1191
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Well, Nintendo's really digging the recent sales of the Wii.

1192
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I mean, the Wii has just been selling like crazy.

1193
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
3.2 million Wiis sold is what Nintendo announced earlier this week.

1194
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's pretty crazy.

1195
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
There's not a lot else.

1196
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I mean, what else can you say about that?

1197
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
They sold 3.2 million Wiis.

1198
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
That's a lot.

1199
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And certainly interesting.

1200
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Now, I don't mean to sound anti-Sony.

1201
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
That's not what I'm trying to do here, but it is interesting when you see a thing like

1202
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
this, and you're putting that next to a story where Sony's like, well, we shipped a million

1203
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
in Japan.

1204
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
So, it kind of sucks for them.

1205
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,800
Well, just more, I think another, though, notch in Nintendo's belt, though, is that

1206
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:59,000
they actually did hit now 10 million consumers in America for the Nintendo DS.

1207
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:08,920
Since the November 2004 launch, that means that nine Nintendo DS or DS lights have sold

1208
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,200
every 60 seconds.

1209
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,200
Wow.

1210
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,720
Yeah, pretty crazy.

1211
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,120
I wonder if Sony's going to start pissing their pants.

1212
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,120
I don't know.

1213
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,640
No, they'll have some creative little press release for this.

1214
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,120
It'll be all the drugs that Kudaragi's taking.

1215
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:31,600
Black Boy in chat sums it up, says, God, Nintendo is making money hand over fist.

1216
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,520
Nintendo is selling in a month and a half with 360 sales in a quarter.

1217
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,520
Interesting.

1218
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,800
So, we have something, a comment on a story we did a little bit ago.

1219
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,360
Cutie Honey is in chat and says, the only Metal Slug America is missing is Metal Slug

1220
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,600
3D, which isn't terribly good, and I think that's to go along with your comment on we

1221
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,440
need more Metal Slug, and now I said, no, we don't.

1222
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,120
Metal Slug has to stay two-dimensional.

1223
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,760
That's just the awesomeness of it.

1224
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,480
I give Metal Slug a lot of crap.

1225
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,480
It is kind of fun.

1226
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,480
I just give Jamie crap for it because she never shuts up about it, but 3D, no, no, no.

1227
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,880
I haven't played it, but I'm not interested.

1228
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,560
If you want to play Metal Slug going the other direction, just play Shock Troopers.

1229
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,560
Okay.

1230
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:22,600
Anyways, off the topic of Metal Slug, but still an awesome game, Scarface is coming

1231
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:28,440
out for the Wii, and that's awesome because apparently, I was reading on some of the features

1232
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,200
of this, you're going to be able to wheel the chainsaw and use the Wiimote to chop off

1233
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,200
limbs.

1234
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,000
Thank God, this is what we needed.

1235
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,720
This is awesome.

1236
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,720
What are you talking about?

1237
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,720
No, I'm serious.

1238
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,280
This really is what we needed.

1239
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,080
Like, you know, come on.

1240
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:48,680
Ever since we heard the Wii is like GameCube with a Nitro Boost in it, it's like, where's

1241
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,400
my fucking Resident Evil 4 with my chainsaw?

1242
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,400
Come on.

1243
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,000
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

1244
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,800
Words cannot describe how happy I am, and to be honest, I mean, I was kind of interested

1245
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,040
in the Godfather game coming out in March, but...

1246
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,480
Do you get to whack people with the Wiimote?

1247
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,000
You do get to manhandle people, though, with the Wiimote, so that's kind of...

1248
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,720
Can you say that again?

1249
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,520
Manhandle people with the Wiimote.

1250
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,520
Okay.

1251
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,520
God, you're so immature.

1252
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,120
No, but yeah, it should be pretty awesome.

1253
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:23,880
You know, of course, God knows when it's coming out, though, not anytime soon, I'd imagine,

1254
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:29,320
but I can't wait to hear more about this.

1255
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,960
That sounds pretty fun.

1256
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:37,120
Well, while we wait for Scarface to come out on the Wii, we could go to a completely different

1257
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,200
genre yet on another Nintendo system.

1258
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,320
Remember the Game Boy Advance?

1259
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,480
Remember it's still alive and kicking?

1260
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,480
I have one of those.

1261
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,480
I found mine.

1262
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,920
It's getting a breath of life in it with the Final Fantasy VI Advance release coming out.

1263
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,280
Now, of course, you've heard about this is getting a new localization.

1264
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,520
Well, what's interesting about the localization is that when they originally made the Final

1265
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:02,440
Fantasy III, they did some family-friendly kind of edits.

1266
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,080
They changed death to doom.

1267
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,560
They changed pubs to cafes.

1268
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:14,120
They changed holy to pearl, whatever, I guess you can't say the word holy, and some naughty

1269
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,400
bits were covered up, pixelated over.

1270
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,160
What's interesting is that there's a screenshot now floating around the internet from Final

1271
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,420
Fantasy VI Advance that shows a monster that was originally called Doomgaze in the Super

1272
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:29,880
Nintendo release, now given its proper name of Deathgaze, which sounds so much more hardcore.

1273
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,880
Oh my God.

1274
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,600
Are they actually going to give Tina the right name?

1275
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,960
That's interesting because this website that I'm looking at the story on siliconera.com

1276
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,960
actually poses the same question.

1277
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,640
Is Tara going to be Tina?

1278
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,640
Why did they change that?

1279
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,640
I don't know.

1280
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,640
I have no idea.

1281
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,400
Tara's, you know, because Tina's such a bad word.

1282
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,780
Maybe is it because Tina sounds more American than Tara?

1283
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,780
I don't know.

1284
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,160
Yeah, for anyone who doesn't know, Tara's original name in the Japanese Final Fantasy

1285
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,160
VI was Tina.

1286
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,160
Oh wait, no.

1287
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,160
I guess there's no way around.

1288
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,160
That's all right.

1289
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,160
I've played the Japanese one.

1290
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,160
So I'm sorry.

1291
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,160
Yeah.

1292
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,160
I guess it was Tara here.

1293
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,040
Were they going for maybe the double entendre where Tara is kind of like Earth?

1294
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,040
I don't know.

1295
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,040
Maybe.

1296
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,040
I don't know.

1297
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,040
Seems a little silly.

1298
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,500
It's just like the whole Aerith thing, isn't it?

1299
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,520
Aerith makes more sense, but then again, if you translate it by the Kana, it would kind

1300
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,240
of, Aerith would also make sense for translation purposes.

1301
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:31,000
Well, one thing that Jamie probably uses to do her translation is several websites out

1302
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,800
there on the internet, and certainly she likes to surf the internet up and down and back

1303
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,320
and forth every week finding her favorites of the internet, and it makes up Dark Sakura's

1304
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,400
Website of the Week.

1305
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,200
Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers this week?

1306
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,240
You should actually be going to PayPal and send me money.

1307
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,560
Oh wait, no.

1308
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,560
Really.

1309
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,560
And it's not a Doctor Who site.

1310
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,560
Okay.

1311
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,560
I'll do one next week, geez.

1312
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,920
A website of the week is massagetherapy.com.

1313
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:07,620
I've been spending a lot of time there because I'm in school to be a massage therapist.

1314
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:11,920
It's really good though because it has a lot about learning about massage, finding a massage

1315
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,040
therapist for your own needs and media.

1316
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:23,200
One thing that I really think is cool in here is there's a body work glossary in here that

1317
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:29,840
lists out a lot of different things you might hear as far as naturopathy, different type

1318
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,280
of health related things, I think it's really cool.

1319
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:40,120
I've learned actually a lot of different modalities just reading through the freaking glossary.

1320
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:44,480
So if anyone is into, even if you're not a massage therapist, even if you don't receive

1321
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,760
a massage, you're trained in natural health, it's really worth looking through and it's

1322
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,040
been very, very educational to me.

1323
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:57,720
SSJ100 Matt says, Jamie, there's no happy ending section.

1324
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,880
People who give happy endings are not real massage therapists.

1325
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:07,400
Now is that massagetherapist.com or massagetherapist.com?

1326
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,200
Massage therapy.

1327
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,800
I don't think that's very funny since this is my chosen profession.

1328
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,800
A joke, Jamie.

1329
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,800
It's a little joke.

1330
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,000
I don't think it's a funny joke because it's funny for the rest of my life.

1331
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I thought it was funny.

1332
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
He thought it was funny.

1333
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Have a little humor.

1334
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Are you either of you massage therapists?

1335
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
No.

1336
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Okay.

1337
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
But if you want me to give you a massage, I'll try.

1338
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
No.

1339
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,360
You might need a little massage.

1340
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,320
Your panties seem like they're in a bunch tonight.

1341
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,320
You know what?

1342
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,320
I'm going to throw this at you.

1343
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,520
I think you need an ass massage to get out all those ruffles in your panties because

1344
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,760
you're quite feathered tonight.

1345
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,920
I'll take the rapist for five minutes.

1346
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,920
Yes.

1347
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,920
Loki got it.

1348
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,920
It was a Saturday Night Live reference.

1349
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,240
Anyway, all kidding aside, you may think at first glance that this has nothing to do with

1350
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,280
gaming, but I say, you know what?

1351
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,640
If your ass starts to feel numb from so much hardcore gaming or your backs are... Maybe

1352
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,560
massage therapy is for you.

1353
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,560
You know what I've noticed?

1354
00:52:54,560 --> 00:53:03,360
Actually, since I've started doing massage, as in giving massage, my endurance in cardiovascular

1355
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:08,200
work, aerobics, has greatly improved.

1356
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,320
Receiving a massage is just as healthy as receiving one if you do it the right way.

1357
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,840
It's good for everybody.

1358
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,600
All right.

1359
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:24,120
Anyways, speaking of unhappy endings, apparently there's actually going to be a price increase

1360
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,400
sort of in the Canadian PlayStation 3s.

1361
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,200
Wait, a price increase for the PlayStation 3?

1362
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,920
Somebody screwed up somewhere big time.

1363
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:43,560
Someone apparently listened to our contest that we had with the PlayStation 3.

1364
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1365
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,560
Make your own slogan.

1366
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:53,080
Anyways, yeah, so there is going to be a slight price increase coming for the PlayStation

1367
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,080
3.

1368
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:58,400
In Canada, the unit's going to cost about $50 more, and I don't think it's in Canadian

1369
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,400
dollars.

1370
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,000
It says for a total of $699.99.

1371
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:09,200
It says both Best Buy and Future Shop have the console listed at the new price.

1372
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,120
The old list price used to be $659.99.

1373
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:17,000
Hasn't the console already been out there for some time?

1374
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,360
I guess that they're increasing price, but here's my thing, though.

1375
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:27,840
I don't know if they're having the same situation as we are here, but if the consoles are rare

1376
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,280
maybe they're just raising prices because they can probably sell them for that, right?

1377
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,840
At least they're on a free game, geez, that's silly, because you know Canada sometimes gets

1378
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,360
bundle packs that we don't get here.

1379
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,920
But yeah, I guess whatever the case is, they're getting hosed over there.

1380
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:53,000
Well, we don't mean to keep picking on Sony, but look guys, they just keep giving us material.

1381
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
What can we say?

1382
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,480
Major Nelson over from Microsoft's camp was very quick to point out this week that Sony

1383
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,520
made a big fat boo-boo on one of their sites.

1384
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,160
There was a PSP site touting video downloads, and one of the video downloads was for Gran

1385
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:11,120
Turismo HD concept, was one of the things you could download, try to get people psyched

1386
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,760
about the PlayStation 3.

1387
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:18,800
Well, they had a screenshot on the website from Gran Turismo HD, but oops, it wasn't

1388
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,040
actually a screenshot of Gran Turismo HD.

1389
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:27,160
It was a screenshot of Project Gotham Racing 3 on Xbox 360.

1390
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,040
Talk about a fuck-up.

1391
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:34,360
You know that that's just some tiny little mistake some intern probably made somewhere,

1392
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:39,680
but still, where was the QA on that?

1393
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,160
Something got screwed up big time.

1394
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:47,940
In the follow-up with that story I was just talking about, according to a Sony rep, that

1395
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:52,480
is the actual case, that it says, although the suggested retail price of the PlayStation

1396
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,520
3 in Canada has not changed, some Canadian retailers have chosen to increase their retail

1397
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,600
price as a result of the weaker Canadian dollar.

1398
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:04,120
This increases solely at the discretion of the retailer, as Sony Computer Entertainment

1399
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,360
Canada has not issued a price increase.

1400
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:11,000
Thank you for the clarification, that makes more sense, thank you.

1401
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,400
I like our chatroom comments, GS68 pokes fun at the Ridge Racer phenomenon going, it's

1402
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,200
Project Gotham, Project Gotham, get it?

1403
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,840
I know it doesn't have the same thing to it, but I see what he did there, that's pretty

1404
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,840
good.

1405
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,840
Hmm.

1406
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:31,920
Well, Sony still though, they still have something shoved up their ass I think.

1407
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,960
Yeah, you remember us talking about that Ghostbusters game?

1408
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,960
I do.

1409
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:46,000
Well, um, Zoofly did confirm that they were preliminary working on one for Xbox 360.

1410
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:55,280
Sony Pictures, however, has pretty much told Zoofly to shut up, pretty much, you know,

1411
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,080
they've removed the content from their website because of Sony.

1412
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:07,080
Any of the content on YouTube has been removed, maybe that just was a breach of NDA, you think?

1413
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,360
Heaven forbid someone put something out there that got people excited for Sony.

1414
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:17,320
Or it could be the fact that Sony owns the rights to the Ghostbusters movies.

1415
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,680
Well, I don't know, whatever.

1416
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,200
Wasn't the game being created for Sony?

1417
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,520
No, it was being created by Zoofly, and they have to get everyone's permission, or they

1418
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,240
hadn't gotten the permission from any of the actors, or...

1419
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,720
But wasn't it being created by them for a Sony console?

1420
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,600
No, it was just being created by them because they like Ghostbusters.

1421
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,840
Oh, I totally misread that story the first time.

1422
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,840
That's alright.

1423
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,840
Interesting.

1424
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,840
Hmm.

1425
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:49,360
Well, yeah, okay, then I guess Sony was just protecting their rights.

1426
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,360
They're all within their rights.

1427
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,360
Ah, I get it.

1428
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:56,080
Well, still, it's never fun to hear about games going away that we were a little bit

1429
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,080
excited for.

1430
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,280
In fact, it makes us a little bit angsty.

1431
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,680
I don't know about you guys, but I get pretty pissed off when games I get excited for get

1432
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:07,520
cancelled, and that calls for some FUs of the week, right, boys and girls?

1433
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,520
Oh, yeah.

1434
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,520
I guess.

1435
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:28,840
The first FU of the week that I have goes towards the wear and tear on my car.

1436
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:33,560
I mean, really, it's not anything that I didn't expect.

1437
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:37,040
You drive your car on road trips, it's gonna wear out.

1438
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,280
It just, it was really kind of freaking me out last night.

1439
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,760
I didn't expect it to start grinding that suddenly.

1440
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,120
And of course, we shelled out 150 bucks for parts.

1441
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:51,840
Thankfully, we have a friend who can replace brakes, and brakes on the Mitsubishi Lancer

1442
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,640
are very easy to replace.

1443
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,640
But Rob...

1444
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,640
I'm not you.

1445
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,640
I'm thinking about something else.

1446
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,640
I'm thinking about...

1447
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,640
It's not related.

1448
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,640
Unlikely, Tori!

1449
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,480
Am I not allowed to laugh and have a good time at this show?

1450
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,480
I'm gonna talk to him about my car.

1451
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,480
No.

1452
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,480
You do that.

1453
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:19,120
So, yeah, a big, big major Uber FU goes to my car not being immortal, I guess.

1454
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:23,960
And another one goes to Rob for parking like an asshole.

1455
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,960
You know what?

1456
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,840
Because I had to pick your ass up because your car was in the shop.

1457
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,960
Had I not had to pick your ass up, I wouldn't have to repark the car.

1458
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,280
Rob, tell me, how many times have you been in the car with me when I've pulled into a

1459
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,560
spot and then backed up and adjusted my parking?

1460
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,900
I don't give a fuck!

1461
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:43,440
I had to contort myself to get out of your damn car.

1462
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,360
And no thank you for the ride or anything like that.

1463
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,320
You park like an asshole, you jerk.

1464
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,320
I thanked you for the ride when you picked me up and I gave you a cookie.

1465
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,320
I gave you cookies!

1466
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,040
Okay, the cookie was good.

1467
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,380
My cookies are great.

1468
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:00,040
My cookies bring all the Robs to my house.

1469
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,320
I'm bringing more cookies next week, too.

1470
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,320
Okay.

1471
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,440
Fuck, you did a superwoman that was in front of me when I was trying to get out of my apartment

1472
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:15,040
complex today because she saw us behind her and she walked slower because she's a jackass.

1473
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:20,440
Also another thing, what the hell is the point, I'm looking at decalgirl.com and they have

1474
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,960
a skin that you can buy for your PlayStation 3 that's black.

1475
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,960
That's like stupid.

1476
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,360
Why the hell would I cover my PlayStation 3 with a skin that's the same color as the

1477
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,380
goddamn PlayStation 3?

1478
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:32,380
I don't know why.

1479
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:35,480
I don't know because you're an idiot, I guess.

1480
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,480
So fuck them.

1481
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,060
I just want to give an F.U. of the week to my Saturday because it kind of sucked because

1482
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:45,120
I had a migraine, which sucks, like they really suck.

1483
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,460
I don't get them very often when I do it really sucks and so I had that and then I got sick

1484
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:54,680
off of dinner and you know, not that I had to perform on Saturday night or anything which

1485
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,800
really pissed me off.

1486
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:02,360
So F.U. to mother nature for playing tricks on me on Saturday, it kind of pissed me off.

1487
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,200
And it ruined my game.

1488
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,600
The game of life.

1489
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:13,060
Speaking of the game of life, at least the game of our lives, ooh, food.

1490
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:20,520
Speaking of games, our favorite topic, at least it was in the last few years, Bomani.

1491
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,120
Bomani's turned 10.

1492
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:26,000
All those music game franchises, they're so old.

1493
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:32,320
Anyways, so to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Bomani, Konami is holding a pop music culture

1494
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:37,920
festival at Tokyo's Laphorette Museum.

1495
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:43,040
So that's pretty awesome, you know, and lots of festivities going along with that, artists,

1496
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,800
you know, performing, DJs, etc.

1497
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:53,320
And I'm sure I, like most people, had similar reactions where it's like, 10 years?

1498
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:57,120
It's been 10 freaking years, god, I'm old.

1499
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,400
I know, seriously.

1500
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,440
I don't know about you guys, but that's my reaction to that.

1501
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,400
I remember, you know, when I first saw Bomani, you know, I remember it was at Fanime, and

1502
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:14,760
we went up to one of the rooms that was there, and they were playing Beatmania on a Playstation,

1503
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:21,040
and they were playing, I remember the song too, it was the Melger Solid theme, and I

1504
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,560
was just like, fucking A, that's awesome.

1505
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,080
I was like, I gotta buy this.

1506
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:30,880
So I did, and I played it, and I stopped playing it, and then next time I saw DDR4th Mix, and

1507
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,400
I was like, ooh, I gotta get that too.

1508
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,920
And then next thing you know, I'm going to arcades and I meet these crazy people, and

1509
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:44,120
they're doing a radio show, and my life just spiraled downhill from there.

1510
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,080
What was your first Bomani?

1511
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:50,280
The very first time I saw Bomani, I went to Milpitas Golf Land to play golf, and I saw

1512
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,400
a bunch of people dancing on the machine, it looked like fun because I was playing Buster

1513
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:58,360
Groove 2 on the Playstation at the time.

1514
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:02,440
So I did not know anything about Japanese imports at the time, so I was playing Buster

1515
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,440
Groove 2.

1516
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,520
I'm giving you, part of me is, the other part of my heart's breaking.

1517
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,920
Well, let it break.

1518
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,920
You're too sassy tonight.

1519
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:11,920
I know.

1520
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,840
You need to, I'm being real with you tonight.

1521
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:18,840
I'm giving that angst right back at you tonight.

1522
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,840
I like it.

1523
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,840
I know you do.

1524
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:25,280
Let's see, so yeah, that was the first time I ever saw it, but there were so many people

1525
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,280
there.

1526
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,760
I think there was a tournament going on or something, but we couldn't play it.

1527
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:33,800
So the first time I actually played was at a Rocky Horror Picture Show convention in

1528
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,800
Las Vegas.

1529
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:40,360
I played at Circus Circus with an iguana girl who ended up going on to be some big admin

1530
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:45,880
over at that DDR Freak site, but I don't think she really plays much anymore, so that was

1531
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:46,880
my first game.

1532
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:52,600
I don't play admin much anymore either, but my first was, and you're going to laugh at

1533
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,640
this, was when I still lived in Alabama playing BM 98.

1534
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,640
You remember BM 98?

1535
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,640
Look, he left the room.

1536
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,640
I'm stealing a french fry.

1537
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,640
Give me one too.

1538
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,640
You want one too?

1539
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,640
Okay.

1540
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,640
Give me his toast.

1541
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,640
You want his piece of toast?

1542
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,640
Here you go.

1543
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,640
Here's a fry.

1544
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,640
Shh, don't tell.

1545
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,640
Okay, yes.

1546
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,640
BM 98, yeah?

1547
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,640
Uh huh.

1548
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:16,040
BM 98 was awesome because it was a customizable, it was one of, I think it was honestly one

1549
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:23,920
of the precursors to many of our simulators today, and you know, so I got to play a lot

1550
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:31,480
of the early Beatmania songs probably right around, actually yeah, 1998, and then my first

1551
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:43,960
DDR was playing the first Mixhome one when I moved out here from Alabama, and then I

1552
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,280
played my first actual machine at.

1553
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,280
Don't glare at me.

1554
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,280
She took one too.

1555
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,080
Rob took it for me though.

1556
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,160
Is that my 7-Up?

1557
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,160
Is that my 7-Up?

1558
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,160
Then I get a fry.

1559
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,160
Oh, I don't care if you're eating my food.

1560
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,120
Rob, go get me a root beer.

1561
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,000
Do I look like your bitch?

1562
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Yes.

1563
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,160
Rob wants to go get me a root beer.

1564
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:13,680
That's awesome, but I honestly think that the simulators like BM 98 got a lot of people

1565
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:21,080
in the very early days of Bimani into these games who might not have otherwise had access

1566
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,360
to them.

1567
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:28,340
I remember trying to make a file a long last time ago for BM 98 and I just couldn't do

1568
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:34,560
it because I got really bored doing it, and from what I understand actually, it's sort

1569
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:40,240
of seeing a resurgence in fan communities, I think that's kind of cool.

1570
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:44,680
My favorite though has to be Delight Delight Reduplication.

1571
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,640
I still have that somewhere.

1572
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:52,800
I remember how awesome it was when Dance with Intensity came out and was just like, wow,

1573
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:58,560
this is so much better, and then Step Media came out and that was pretty cool too, but

1574
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,680
who'd have thought.

1575
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:05,060
Although slightly related to the family of Bimani games is one of the really horrid games

1576
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:10,480
that I think Konami should disavow any knowledge of, and that's Dance Dance Dance.

1577
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,920
It was shitty.

1578
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,800
In my professional opinion, as an internet celebrity.

1579
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,120
Don't you hate it when you think of good ideas, like right when you get back in the chair

1580
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:24,200
and somebody in the chat room actually said it, Bandit says, bet he shakes the can.

1581
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:30,600
That would have been an awesome idea, especially because Jamie's working on her laptop.

1582
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,600
She would have cried.

1583
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:36,400
No, I would have picked up my destroyed laptop and thrown it at your PC.

1584
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:41,600
That would have been a fun show, suddenly we're knocked off air.

1585
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,060
And then Jeremy Todd One would like to point this out.

1586
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:50,160
He sent this to me in a message there in the chat room, and he's sent me a little slip

1587
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,120
from YouParkLikeAnAsshole.com, although I'd like to point out he didn't even see it, Jeremy

1588
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,120
Todd One.

1589
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,120
Oh yeah.

1590
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:00,880
He checked off two spots, one car, a little too close, over the painted lines, diagonal

1591
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,120
parking, cool car, diagonal parking, not so cool car, and then he checked off other for

1592
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,120
sucking.

1593
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,120
For sucking.

1594
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,120
I hate you.

1595
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,120
You know what?

1596
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,420
DMN agrees with us, agrees with me and Jeremy Todd One, by the way.

1597
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:16,000
For this, Jeremy Todd One gets a kick from the chat room, we'll just do that, control

1598
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,280
kick, there we go, nice good kick from the chat room.

1599
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:22,800
DMN wanted me to punch you in the arm, and he gave me a heart if I did it, so I'm gonna

1600
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,800
punch Robin.

1601
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,640
No, I got you a gun, ow!

1602
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,640
You're a real bitch tonight.

1603
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,640
I am not, I'm nice.

1604
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:35,120
I gave you cookies.

1605
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,120
It's always the cookies.

1606
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,120
It always comes back to the cookies.

1607
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,000
I know, you did it all for the cookie.

1608
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,400
All right, did everybody have fun reminiscing about the Bemani?

1609
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,240
Yes, and thank you for my root beer.

1610
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,240
You're welcome.

1611
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:49,120
All right, Harmonics talked this week a little bit about something that's not Bemani related,

1612
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:53,360
because you know, Harmonics didn't make Bemani, but certainly they're a huge, huge player

1613
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:57,080
in the music video game franchise, and they are talking about the guitar.

1614
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,800
Technically, they did kind of work on Bemani.

1615
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:04,040
Oh, that's true, Karaoke Revolution, I stand corrected, so they have dabbled in Bemani

1616
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:05,040
a little bit.

1617
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:09,720
Well, and that was definitely two forces coming together, that was pretty cool.

1618
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,840
Yeah, what a fucking monster that made.

1619
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:18,240
Anywho, one of the folks that works over at Harmonics, and that would be Daniel Sussman,

1620
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:22,400
who is a producer over at Harmonics, quote, here's the official line, Harmonics can confirm

1621
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,960
that we are not developing Guitar Hero 3, and that backs up the story from last week

1622
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,880
about Neversoft, who did the Tony Hawk games, are taking over that.

1623
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:36,440
He also said this, quote, we are instead working on a different music game project, one that

1624
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:41,600
is bigger and more ambitious endeavor than we felt we could pursue with the balance of

1625
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,120
the Guitar Hero franchise.

1626
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:48,600
Further specific details on exact subject and publisher from the game are not yet released.

1627
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,760
We'll see.

1628
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:53,580
You know, I'm thinking though, a lot of people are going, oh, it's Guitar Hero, or it's Guitar

1629
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:58,920
Villain, or it's Drum Hero, or it's Keyboard Hero, or it's a sequel to Amplitude of Frequency.

1630
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:03,560
I think when this guy uses terms like, we are working on a different music game project

1631
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,000
that is bigger and more ambitious, I think it's bigger than all that.

1632
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I think it's different.

1633
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,440
I think it's something brand new you haven't even thought of yet that Harmonics is working

1634
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,440
on.

1635
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,440
I think it's called Huge Ass Symphony, the game.

1636
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,120
I think it's just some new concept we don't even know yet until we hear it.

1637
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,300
I think it's Oonga Boonga, the musical.

1638
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:22,240
It's Guns and Roses, the game, an ego bigger than Axl Rose.

1639
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:28,720
Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, at least for Guitar Hero 2 for Xbox Live, the multiplayer

1640
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:34,240
dream has crashed and burned.

1641
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:39,680
The guitar still has the microphone in it too, but there's no online multiplayer.

1642
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:46,640
All of the modes, co-op face-off, pro face-off modes are offline only, so, sorry y'all.

1643
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,160
Yeah, it's gotta be lag.

1644
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,680
I'm pretty much thinking so.

1645
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:57,600
But I still think it's cool though, you know, the downloadable packs, because that, it really

1646
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:03,580
gives the experience very similar, I think, to Karaoke Revolution on Xbox, but it really

1647
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:10,480
gives the game a really, I'd say, a lot of replayability.

1648
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,920
They should just add, well, I'm sure they'll have a leaderboard.

1649
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,320
They need the war pack.

1650
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,520
So that's what they just need to do, stick with the leaderboard.

1651
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:22,240
You know, I've given Guitar Hero a little bit of crap on this show, just because I don't

1652
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,880
foam at the mouth over it like everyone else does, I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Guitar

1653
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,760
Hero, it's so awesome, and I actually prefer it to Guitar Freaks, I really do, which for

1654
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,400
somebody with a Bomani, you know, a heart Konami type thing is a huge thing to say.

1655
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,400
I know, look.

1656
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,440
It bypasses your Bomani boner?

1657
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,960
Kind of, in the guitar region it does.

1658
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:44,980
I would, you know, I would have five hard-ons somehow if they would make a keyboard game

1659
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:46,320
like they did Guitar Hero.

1660
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,960
I really would, because I'd love to have keyboard mania.

1661
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,280
You would probably be Edward Penis Hands.

1662
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,280
Probably.

1663
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,880
I don't know how it would happen.

1664
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,720
That's a reference I hadn't heard in forever.

1665
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:01,500
I would totally be happy if they would do that, but I am getting more and more excited

1666
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,720
about its release on the 360.

1667
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,840
I'm pumped for it, I'm going to definitely pick it out when it comes, or pick it up when

1668
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,840
it comes out.

1669
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,420
What about DDR on the 360?

1670
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:13,120
You know what, I looked at some, there's some new videos that hit the internet this week,

1671
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,540
and I think it looks great.

1672
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:15,800
I'm really excited about it.

1673
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,960
I think it's going to be an awesome game.

1674
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,240
I think my neighbors are going to hate me.

1675
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:22,440
Mine are going to hate me too, and I finally need to get my dance pad back from Jamie.

1676
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,960
She's had it for like a year and a half.

1677
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,160
I gave, no, I gave it back to you.

1678
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,160
I don't, no, no, you took-

1679
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,160
One of the steps didn't work.

1680
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,600
No, no, that was the old dance pad.

1681
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,520
You took my other one, because remember when there was a Guitar Hero story?

1682
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,520
It was in the background.

1683
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,400
No, you took that back with you.

1684
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,400
I gave it back to you.

1685
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,400
No, I don't have it.

1686
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,280
Well, then it's probably in the vault.

1687
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,060
She forgot to tell you that she sold it for a pinball machine.

1688
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:42,060
She probably did.

1689
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,100
No, Dan sold it for a pinball machine.

1690
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,720
She sold it for a pinball- Dude, we got another freaking pinball machine,

1691
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,720
by the way.

1692
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,720
We got an Earthshaker.

1693
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,720
Anyway.

1694
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,600
I haven't even fucking heard of that.

1695
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,680
The Rosie O'Donnell pinball machine, the Earthshaker.

1696
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:01,200
Actually Earthshaker is in the same family as Roland, it's pretty old school and awesome.

1697
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,160
One of those machines that collectors want, anyway.

1698
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:08,480
I still want my Doctor Who pinball machine, and Dan hasn't accommodated me.

1699
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:13,360
Joshi16 has an interesting line in chat, what would Brian Boitano do?

1700
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,320
Get all the developers in town and make a game to amaze the noobs.

1701
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,600
That's what Brian Boitano would do.

1702
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,600
I tried to sing it.

1703
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,600
That's fantastic.

1704
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,640
It failed miserably because I had no voice.

1705
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,640
That's okay.

1706
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,640
You haven't excused this time.

1707
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:26,640
I do.

1708
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,680
Oh, this is exciting when Dark Soccer is letting me have not just one, but two buys tonight.

1709
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,800
I got one for Bust a Groove 2, and I got another for my voice.

1710
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,800
I'm excited.

1711
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,440
And you were calling me a bitch.

1712
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,680
If the shoe fits.

1713
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,200
Very accommodating, Rob.

1714
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,480
I only punched you because DMN told me to.

1715
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,200
Well, DMN's a bitch too.

1716
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,160
He is, but we like his bitchiness.

1717
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,300
You know there's nothing but heart for the Jamie.

1718
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,620
Nothing but heart.

1719
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,000
The bleeding heart.

1720
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
There's a heart.

1721
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Alright.

1722
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
With a knife through it.

1723
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,760
We're going to go to a quick break here and come back in a little bit with Orange

1724
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:07,000
Lounge Radio Part B because Jamie and I have to have a hug-a-thon to make up for all the

1725
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,840
fighting we're doing tonight, so we're going to have a hug-a-thon during the break.

1726
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,200
So we'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1727
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,320
For those of you guys listening on our audio archive, also known as podcasting, we'll be

1728
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:21,160
back in a couple days, probably about Wednesday-ish, with Part B.

1729
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,920
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1730
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:26,920
a week.

1731
