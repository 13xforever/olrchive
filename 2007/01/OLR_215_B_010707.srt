00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:19,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:24,423
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 215 for this January 7th, 2007.

3
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:34,807
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's going on actually right now while we're doing tonight's program and taping here live on this Sunday night is that actually Microsoft is giving their keynote speech right now, right?

4
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:37,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Over for CES because Consumer Electronics Show is going on?

5
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

6
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, you've got to start us off with Part B, talking about what's going on at CES right now.

7
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:45,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there's a couple of big announcements.

8
00:00:46,024 --> 00:00:49,968
[SPEAKER_12]: made about, you know, during CES and the keynote speech here.

9
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:59,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, as we mentioned earlier, their big announcement, of course, was partnership, I guess, with Microsoft TV, which is an IPTV service.

10
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:10,187
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're going to be able to watch TV, I guess, streamed over the Internet, as well as record TV while playing games, which is pretty cool.

11
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:17,367
[SPEAKER_12]: and no clue yet when exactly that's going to go into effect, but it's something that they're going to launch this year.

12
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:25,270
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to have digital video recording capabilities for gaming movie viewing and even voice and video chat.

13
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,652
[SPEAKER_12]: It says we're really going to need a big hard drive for that.

14
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:35,053
[SPEAKER_12]: It says live chat while watching television.

15
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:38,683
[SPEAKER_12]: So people can watch Lost or something.

16
00:01:38,903 --> 00:01:40,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, that's a bad idea.

17
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:48,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Playing over Xbox Live while recording TV live in the background.

18
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:54,334
[SPEAKER_12]: And this isn't a huge surprise, because I remember they were talking about something with DirecTV before.

19
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:57,357
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know.

20
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:58,237
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of cool.

21
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:03,761
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing which is going on right now that they were talking about was...

22
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,060
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe Halo 2 for Vista

23
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:38,635
[SPEAKER_12]: But that is not the only game that you can play anywhere.

24
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:43,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Which just was announced a few seconds ago here.

25
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:50,462
[SPEAKER_12]: The one live anywhere game that's going to be able to be played on Vista, on 360, and everything else.

26
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:53,483
[SPEAKER_12]: But not only than Uno.

27
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:55,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Uno Anywhere.

28
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:57,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my gosh, wow, interesting.

29
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:01,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Really, you know, I always thought you could play Uno Anywhere anyways because it's cards, but...

30
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:03,317
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just me.

31
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:05,512
[SPEAKER_13]: You can play the electronic version anywhere you want.

32
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Draw4Bitch everywhere across multiple platforms.

33
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,381
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I think it's interesting because it's not a big surprise.

34
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,442
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't seem like anything that would be too difficult to do.

35
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:17,384
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, cross-platform gaming is not unheard of.

36
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:23,707
[SPEAKER_13]: And even with 360, I mean, Final Fantasy XI, you play against PlayStation 2 and PC users on Final Fantasy XI, right?

37
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:24,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is on the 360.

38
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:26,188
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not like this is unheard of.

39
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,249
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just kind of, I don't think anybody thought that they would do this.

40
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,051
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's not really anything anyone was expecting.

41
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:35,332
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really, truly a kind of pleasant surprise, if you will.

42
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:35,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

43
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:36,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of interesting.

44
00:03:37,738 --> 00:03:40,579
[SPEAKER_13]: For once and for all, they will be able to settle the debate.

45
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:45,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it easier to play with the keyboard and mouse or with the 360 controller?

46
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,680
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll be able to finally settle that debate.

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

48
00:03:49,461 --> 00:03:49,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Very cool.

49
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:56,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the chat room seems to be agreeing over at chat.orangelonestradio.com.

50
00:03:56,582 --> 00:03:58,682
[SPEAKER_13]: You can play Uno with anyone anytime you want.

51
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:00,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Just buy a deck of cards.

52
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:01,543
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very easy.

53
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an Uno deck.

54
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:07,664
[SPEAKER_13]: But you can't get the Cameo cards and the Project Gotham Racing cards.

55
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:07,964
[SPEAKER_13]: So?

56
00:04:09,864 --> 00:04:18,207
[SPEAKER_13]: But I believe you can get, in regular traditional card form, you can get Pokemon cards and the clear cards so you can play Uno in the pool.

57
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:22,608
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, you can play World of Warcraft cards, too, once those come out.

58
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:23,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Hooray, hooray.

59
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:26,950
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

60
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I guess that's all we have coming out of CES right now.

61
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:32,539
[SPEAKER_12]: There is one other thing.

62
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:39,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Sony's saying that they've hit their target amount of units shipped for the PlayStation 3, which was 1 million by the end of the year.

63
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:46,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, if memory serves me correctly, I believe that target was a lot higher, and then they lowered it down.

64
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,893
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing, too, is they've shipped 1 million units worldwide.

65
00:04:51,354 --> 00:04:52,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Not sold, shipped.

66
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:53,596
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll sell it.

67
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:54,616
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll sell it.

68
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:59,300
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we're all seeing the big pictures of stacks and stacks of PS3s on block.

69
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,340
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll sell them.

70
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Their next target is 6 million by March this year, so.

71
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:05,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Now that's ambitious.

72
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:06,404
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

73
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:12,007
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing I wanted to ask about, too, and you showed me this during the break while we were alive.

74
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:18,852
[SPEAKER_13]: You have this Impossible Mission ad, and I want, it's Impossible Mission on the Wii, like the old school Commodore 64 game.

75
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:19,813
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's one of the games.

76
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:22,675
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember hearing Epyx was coming back and was going to redo games.

77
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:23,956
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell is this?

78
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:24,316
[SPEAKER_13]: I want it.

79
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:25,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, Loki.

80
00:05:26,197 --> 00:05:28,819
[SPEAKER_12]: It's being released in the UK right now.

81
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:33,299
[SPEAKER_12]: System 3 is putting it out.

82
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:37,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, this is an ad sheet that they had on GoNintendo.com.

83
00:05:38,763 --> 00:05:41,104
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just an impossible mission.

84
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:44,026
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 2D.

85
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:48,989
[SPEAKER_12]: It just looks like a visually updated version of a possible mission.

86
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,011
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're only getting it in Britain and not here?

87
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:52,391
[SPEAKER_12]: So far.

88
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:54,233
[SPEAKER_12]: It might end up coming over here.

89
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:55,613
[SPEAKER_13]: The one game I want.

90
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:57,835
[SPEAKER_13]: They do this to us.

91
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:02,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't say you folks over there don't get some love.

92
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:04,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe you should import a Wii.

93
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:06,990
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to import... Well, I can.

94
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,851
[SPEAKER_13]: They're on the different TV standards over there.

95
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:09,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Component.

96
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:11,172
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's true.

97
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,393
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to import a Wii just to play Impossible Mission.

98
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:14,913
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

99
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:19,015
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll just... I'll write nasty grams to whatever company... System 3.

100
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:21,616
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll write nasty grams to them until they put this out in the U.S.

101
00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:23,617
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure it'll come out over here at some point.

102
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:24,077
[SPEAKER_13]: It better.

103
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:26,038
[SPEAKER_13]: At least it's a budget title if nothing else.

104
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:28,919
[SPEAKER_12]: So... Well...

105
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,620
[SPEAKER_13]: E for everyone!

106
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:02,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I love games!

107
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:04,007
[SPEAKER_13]: They're so pretty!

108
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I have a hug?

109
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,990
[SPEAKER_12]: The Entertainment for All Expo... Jamie!

110
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:09,911
[SPEAKER_12]: Cuddle!

111
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,514
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

112
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:14,154
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

113
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:23,001
[SPEAKER_12]: The Entertainment for All Expo, as it suggests, is open to the public if you have $100, because it's going to cost you $100 to get into it.

114
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:25,443
[SPEAKER_12]: So... Well, what?

115
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:26,604
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to cost what?

116
00:07:26,984 --> 00:07:28,585
[SPEAKER_12]: $100 to get into the Expo.

117
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:29,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Ugh.

118
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:32,015
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's not too bad.

119
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:41,283
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if E3 wanted to charge you $100 to get in... Actually, from what I remember, any schmo could really get into E3 for, what, that $400 fee or whatever it is.

120
00:07:41,864 --> 00:07:44,386
[SPEAKER_13]: You really didn't even have to have ties to the industry to get in that way.

121
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:47,829
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, this is, I guess, cheaper than that.

122
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:54,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I imagine this expo will still be letting in, you know, media and all that type of stuff for a different rate.

123
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably not the same $100.

124
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:56,356
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

125
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:56,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

126
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:57,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

127
00:07:58,038 --> 00:07:58,438
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

128
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:03,781
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, it'll be interesting to see how it ends up going down.

129
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:08,588
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's going to be this year, 18th through the 20th of October.

130
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,035
[SPEAKER_13]: And good point, we got several people starting with Blackboy saying, except it isn't E3.

131
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:14,778
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, I understand, but...

132
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:18,628
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of, for all we know, all we got otherwise.

133
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:28,450
[SPEAKER_13]: And they say they're trying to fill the void, so I realize it's going to be a little different because it's going to be targeted at the gamer as opposed to the industry, but it should be interesting nonetheless.

134
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I should be able to still go to the E3, the actual E3.

135
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:35,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's true, because it's not going away.

136
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:37,752
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be interesting to see what happens.

137
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:39,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't fucking take me to E3, bitches.

138
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:41,993
[SPEAKER_12]: I need this.

139
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:43,773
[SPEAKER_12]: It's my high.

140
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:47,065
[SPEAKER_13]: I need that E, man.

141
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:48,887
[SPEAKER_13]: I need to cuddle.

142
00:09:06,907 --> 00:09:07,608
[SPEAKER_13]: and DarkSakura.com.

143
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:34,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Very interesting.

144
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:36,309
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, just a few months ago, we were talking about all that fear.

145
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:42,774
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, I know it's easy to want to, like, jump on Sony and be all like, ha-ha, Sony's not selling systems, blah, blah, blah.

146
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:44,916
[SPEAKER_13]: But you kind of have to think about, too, Christmas is over.

147
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:48,967
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think more people are willing to wait, but I don't know.

148
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:54,150
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess then again, the Wii is still seemingly selling out, and the 360 at this time last year was still selling out too.

149
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,731
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

150
00:09:56,131 --> 00:10:03,776
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be very interested to see it on a graph, like how many systems Microsoft had out there at this time last year, and how many Sony has out there now.

151
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:04,852
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

152
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:07,394
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's just because I'm a visual person, I want to see everything on a graph.

153
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:09,795
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'd be very interested to see how it really compares.

154
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:14,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you could say that the 360 was still sold out, but from what I remember, they weren't coming out very often.

155
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:17,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas Sony seems to be doing a pretty consistent weekly shipment.

156
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:24,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, according to this was the big thing that they were pushing, they were saying that we outsold the 360 because we put out a million units before the end of the year and they only had 600,000.

157
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:29,626
[SPEAKER_12]: So... Yeah, but... Interesting.

158
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:33,588
[SPEAKER_12]: But here's the thing, Microsoft was like, yeah, but bitches, we were out the year before you, so...

159
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:35,850
[SPEAKER_12]: We're ahead of you by a couple million.

160
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:42,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so Sony's saying they're on the track to outsell the 360 is what they're saying.

161
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:46,778
[SPEAKER_12]: They're still convinced that they're... Microsoft's saying, we lapped you, bitch.

162
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,920
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just like saying, oh, we're meeting our numbers.

163
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:57,946
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, when you drop your numbers like six times and then you're like, oh yeah, we met our numbers fucking six months late.

164
00:10:59,282 --> 00:11:00,603
[SPEAKER_12]: and we lowered them a bit.

165
00:11:01,163 --> 00:11:01,783
[SPEAKER_12]: But we met them.

166
00:11:02,184 --> 00:11:03,204
[SPEAKER_12]: God damn it, we met them.

167
00:11:03,404 --> 00:11:11,028
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, no, you didn't technically meet them because, well, you only ship less than 400,000 units at launch in the U.S., so, whatever.

168
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:13,969
[SPEAKER_13]: DDR Dollar Bill says, this is Sony math.

169
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

170
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, it's the math of those who eat crayons every day.

171
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:26,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we have a little bit of something flying around on the rumor mill.

172
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:27,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

173
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:29,984
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

174
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:52,878
[SPEAKER_13]: To where we were at that last Konami event that they had in, what, August?

175
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:55,499
[SPEAKER_13]: And I remember they were showing Coded Arms on the PSP, right, Loki?

176
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:55,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

177
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,642
[SPEAKER_13]: But they never showed us Coded Arms on PS3, but I remember some of the other journalists were asking about it.

178
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:02,004
[SPEAKER_13]: They were really dodgy at the questions at the time, huh?

179
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:02,924
[SPEAKER_13]: If I remember right.

180
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:05,346
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like they didn't want to say much about it.

181
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:07,868
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, at E3, I think it was only a video.

182
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:08,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

183
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:12,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this other press event we went to was after that, so... Yeah.

184
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,692
[SPEAKER_13]: But they still were not really saying much about it, huh?

185
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:16,053
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess we'll find out in a few weeks.

186
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:16,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I guess it's interesting.

187
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:21,309
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to say I heard that the game was really buggy and crappy from the beta or whatever state it's in right now, alpha or whatever

188
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:48,289
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

189
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,668
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, it's not coming out anytime soon either way.

190
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:04,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Mystic Gohan says, well, Coded Arms sucked, so I'm not getting my hopes up yet.

191
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:08,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Legend of Zaku says, only thing that can save PlayStation 3 is Metal Gear Solid 4.

192
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:11,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Mike W. also agrees, Coded Arms sucked ass.

193
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:13,616
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really think you need to save the PlayStation 3.

194
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:16,878
[SPEAKER_12]: The only thing you need to save the PlayStation 3 is put more games out, that's about it.

195
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:19,399
[SPEAKER_12]: And put more games out that haven't been out for six months on the 360.

196
00:13:19,739 --> 00:13:21,920
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's what they need to do.

197
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,263
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, why the fuck, seriously, like, games that are supposed to be launch titles, like

198
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:29,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Rainbow Six Vegas or something like that and they haven't even put it out yet.

199
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,550
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, come on.

200
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,350
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the problem.

201
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:46,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, so as we were probably talking about here, Metal Gear Solid and how Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3.

202
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:49,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops just came out on the PSP.

203
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:53,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Not a huge surprise that they're talking about getting a sequel done already.

204
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:55,616
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, since the game

205
00:13:56,064 --> 00:13:57,085
[SPEAKER_12]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

206
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:26,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I hope not.

207
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:28,927
[SPEAKER_13]: But maybe it'll come with cool 3D glasses.

208
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:33,949
[SPEAKER_08]: That was actually... I don't think your acid is like what happens when you program a game on acid.

209
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:35,269
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what, though?

210
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:36,950
[SPEAKER_13]: The 3D thing I actually thought was kind of cute.

211
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:42,091
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to admit, that little, you know, the little paper glasses or whatever they're playing acid 2 on, it's actually kind of cute.

212
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:43,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it was cute watching Dan play it.

213
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:45,833
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what the best part about the 3D glasses?

214
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:46,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Huh?

215
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:51,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Were the videos of the hot Asian chicks wearing the camo bikinis that you would unlock from playing the game.

216
00:14:52,295 --> 00:14:52,375
[SPEAKER_12]: In 3D.

217
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:59,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, I thought you got laid on a regular basis.

218
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:05,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not even talk about Asian girls in bikinis and things because... Yeah, how's Dead or Alive Extreme going?

219
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:15,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually referring to a video that one of our listeners, I don't know if he wants to tell me about it, he just laughed at it.

220
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:24,644
[SPEAKER_08]: I got sent Aparapara videos with really ugly, way too skinny Japanese girls in bikinis.

221
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:26,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Ganguro Makeup.

222
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:34,787
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you can't say those words together in a sentence without me freaking out a little bit.

223
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:38,407
[SPEAKER_12]: We had some weirder stuff with the Asian girls on the Wednesday show.

224
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:41,308
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not even going there.

225
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:48,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's move on to one other way that listeners can interact with us and give their feedback is our voicemail.

226
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:48,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Our 800 number, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

227
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:49,369
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

228
00:15:55,194 --> 00:16:21,874
[SPEAKER_13]: and we got some voicemails this week thanks to those of you guys that left the voicemails that number is toll free in the US and Canada but I want to point out it's not toll free outside of that which makes this first voicemail all the more special this actually came in on the Skype part of that because if you are in the UK or Australia, New Zealand wherever the heck you are in the world you can use the Skype to leave us a message for free you can just call Orange Lounge Radio when we're not live and leave us a voicemail that's what this first voicemail is from let's take a listen

229
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:25,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, this is Sosha from the UK.

230
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:45,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just wondering, you mentioned every Xtend Extra on the show a couple of times, so I looked it up, and it's not coming out in the UK until like the middle of February, and I was wondering if you were importing it off eBay, and also is DDR Supernova worth the wait, because it's coming out in like February as well, I think.

231
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:48,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, guys, keep up the good work.

232
00:16:48,493 --> 00:16:52,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I love listening to the show, especially when I'm on the bus because bus rides are so boring.

233
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:57,839
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do get funny looks when I start laughing at all the weird stuff you come out with.

234
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, guys, see ya.

235
00:17:00,862 --> 00:17:01,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the voicemail.

236
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:02,503
[SPEAKER_13]: That was pretty awesome.

237
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:03,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

238
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:11,829
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as Every Extend Extra goes, check out... You can actually play for free on the internet.

239
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,691
[SPEAKER_13]: You can download Every Extend...

240
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:15,483
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

241
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:22,624
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

242
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:53,864
[SPEAKER_13]: And the game's pretty fun.

243
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:54,784
[SPEAKER_13]: It's no Luminous.

244
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:57,446
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't hold it up to that same high caliber.

245
00:17:57,726 --> 00:17:59,967
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a little more action than it is puzzle.

246
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:02,528
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's more of like a fast-paced puzzle game.

247
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,189
[SPEAKER_13]: There's definitely a lot of action element involved.

248
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:05,190
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's pretty cool.

249
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,792
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as DDR Supernova, it's kind of hard to tell because the game varies from region to region because of licenses.

250
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,154
[SPEAKER_13]: But here in America, I did think Supernova was probably...

251
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:18,416
[SPEAKER_13]: about on the same level with DDR Extreme 2, if not a little bit better.

252
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:24,138
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd say it's worth your time if you're a DDR fan, or if you've never played the series before, it certainly is a good enabler.

253
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:32,342
[SPEAKER_13]: And from what I remember, the UK, in my opinion anyway, typically gets better licenses anyway than we do, so I'm sure it's going to be even more worth your while.

254
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:38,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd have to say the last Stepping Stage had a... Not Stepping... Yeah, is it... What is it?

255
00:18:38,404 --> 00:18:39,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Stepping Stage, it's a...

256
00:18:41,243 --> 00:18:45,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Dancing Stage, that's what I'm trying to think of, had actually a really, really good track list.

257
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:50,408
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd hope that some of those would be incorporated into some of our releases, but unfortunately, no.

258
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:57,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah, it's always like a licensing issue, and you know, the music that sells over there isn't the same that sells over here all the time.

259
00:18:57,691 --> 00:19:00,573
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, some of the hits are the same, but for instance, you know, take an artist like...

260
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:01,865
[SPEAKER_13]: Robby Williams

261
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:17,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, this is Razorburn2021.

262
00:19:17,596 --> 00:19:18,516
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll never see me in the chat room.

263
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:19,397
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll probably never see me around.

264
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:19,897
[SPEAKER_13]: I happen to be in

265
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:47,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Offline Listener.

266
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:51,183
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen via my PSP and Bleaching Connections.

267
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:55,264
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to thank you for a very nice year of episodes.

268
00:19:55,664 --> 00:20:06,387
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to them at work and they really provide me with the news, albeit it's generally kind of a week late of stuff, but it's a way I'm able to keep up on what's going in the gaming world.

269
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:10,509
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of jumped back and forth between a lot of podcasts.

270
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:14,370
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the first ones I've picked up and I've stuck with you.

271
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:14,530
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm

272
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:22,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really happy with your show and I want to wish you a happy new year and say thank you and please provide me more in the future.

273
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:25,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Aw, thanks for the warm fuzzies.

274
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:25,871
[SPEAKER_13]: We appreciate that.

275
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:27,792
[SPEAKER_13]: We like the little compliments to keep us going.

276
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:28,412
[SPEAKER_13]: That's very nice.

277
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:35,897
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, all things considered, there's a purposeful reason why I played this one because he said that he listened to the show on the PSP.

278
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:40,781
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think last week on the New Year's Eve special, I was a little bit harsh on the PSP.

279
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:49,722
[SPEAKER_13]: I do really like the PSP as a multimedia device.

280
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:51,984
[SPEAKER_13]: It is an incredible multimedia device.

281
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:57,089
[SPEAKER_13]: It plays videos, MP3s, and games and all the movie stuff on top of that.

282
00:20:57,629 --> 00:21:01,710
[SPEAKER_13]: The problem is, as a gaming device solely, I don't think it's up to par with the DS.

283
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,030
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's my own personal opinion.

284
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:06,851
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think the library of games that the PSP is offering is quite up to par with the DS.

285
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:14,273
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think the fact that people do listen to the show on the PSP kind of speaks to why the PSP is a pretty good system.

286
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:19,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Because of the fact, hey, not only can you listen to these RSS feeds on the go over the internet, but you can play Luminous too.

287
00:21:20,234 --> 00:21:22,635
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's what's great about the PSP.

288
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:52,801
[SPEAKER_13]: and why if you don't own one you should think about it I mean they are they really are pretty decent systems they're just not if you're only looking for gaming and maybe you already have an iPod you already have a laptop to get your podcast on the go or whatever maybe you don't need it you know but if you don't have any of that stuff I think the PSP is a pretty good buy to get a lot of that crap on the go if you haven't bought one yet you might want to hold off anyways because you know what the rumor mills been saying is that they're going to redesign it anyway so

289
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:54,529
[SPEAKER_12]: and DarkSakura.com.

290
00:22:04,312 --> 00:22:06,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Silly, I'm talking about portable devices, obviously.

291
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:08,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Laptop.

292
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:11,438
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, but laptops are thousands of dollars for a good one.

293
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:14,480
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're not that, I mean, they're portable, but you've got to whip this thing out.

294
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,681
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not that portable.

295
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:16,682
[SPEAKER_13]: PSP.

296
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:18,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, but PSP goes in your, but sidekick.

297
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:24,168
[SPEAKER_13]: A PSP is better than a sidekick, I think, except for the fact you can't make calls with a PSP.

298
00:22:24,228 --> 00:22:25,829
[SPEAKER_13]: I already have a phone.

299
00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:28,832
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the PSP is a pretty cool little pocket system.

300
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:31,233
[SPEAKER_13]: How big are your pockets?

301
00:22:31,694 --> 00:22:31,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Big.

302
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:34,452
[SPEAKER_13]: I can fit PSP in my pocket, no problem.

303
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:35,213
[SPEAKER_13]: I can fit PSP in my pocket.

304
00:22:35,593 --> 00:22:36,594
[SPEAKER_08]: My DS fits in my purse.

305
00:22:37,435 --> 00:22:38,296
[SPEAKER_08]: That little micro thing.

306
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Your PSP could probably fit in your purse, too.

307
00:22:40,658 --> 00:22:41,119
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it wouldn't.

308
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:41,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

309
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,544
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I can barely get... I have no idea what happened to my Sonic screwdriver.

310
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:47,585
[SPEAKER_08]: It fell out of my purse.

311
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:48,405
[SPEAKER_08]: That sucks.

312
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:49,386
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't even that fit.

313
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:50,848
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

314
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,951
[SPEAKER_13]: And there was another comment in here somewhere I wanted to read.

315
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:56,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I guess that was it.

316
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:58,555
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't find the other one, so there you have it.

317
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:04,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Chat.OrangeHouseRadio.com if you're listening live on this Sunday night and you want to join or entertain your thoughts.

318
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:08,545
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course the chat room is open all week long and it gets kind of dead when there's no live programming.

319
00:23:08,685 --> 00:23:09,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to agree with Ranma on this.

320
00:23:09,946 --> 00:23:10,447
[SPEAKER_13]: What did Ranma say?

321
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:13,991
[SPEAKER_08]: A laptop may be thousands of dollars but it is more useful than a damn PSP.

322
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:14,472
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

323
00:23:15,112 --> 00:23:20,476
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're a 14-year-old kid, you may not have a need for a laptop.

324
00:23:20,496 --> 00:23:21,957
[SPEAKER_08]: They make very small laptops, too.

325
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:22,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Those new Vios.

326
00:23:23,257 --> 00:23:28,701
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think, yes, a laptop you get a lot of value of, but you have to ask yourself, do you really need all that stuff?

327
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:38,007
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, how easy is it to turn on your PSP, click, have the headphones in, and listen to the show, as opposed to, I better whip out the laptop, fire up iTunes, da-da-da.

328
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:39,148
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

329
00:23:39,188 --> 00:23:40,889
[SPEAKER_13]: A laptop serves a very useful purpose.

330
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:46,291
[SPEAKER_13]: I heart my little Mac laptop, and it's one of the best purchases I made last year.

331
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:50,852
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, I still also like my PSP for those types of things.

332
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:52,012
[SPEAKER_13]: I need a bigger memory card, though.

333
00:23:53,053 --> 00:23:53,313
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

334
00:23:55,033 --> 00:24:01,635
[SPEAKER_13]: You can also interact with us by sending us emails to mailbag at orangelauncher.com, and we will get to the mailbag a little bit later in the show.

335
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:03,076
[SPEAKER_13]: But first, more news.

336
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:06,297
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to start off with this story coming from Korea.

337
00:24:06,317 --> 00:24:06,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Korea.

338
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Game censorship, a hot topic worldwide, not just Korea, but worldwide.

339
00:24:11,564 --> 00:24:21,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, you know, in 2006, we had Rule of Rose causing the problems in Europe and Tack Johnson getting his head into everything over here, which we just go away.

340
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,901
[SPEAKER_13]: In South Korea, things are actually going kind of,

341
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,421
[SPEAKER_13]: and DarkSakura.com

342
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:54,639
[SPEAKER_13]: But what just recently happened, the Game Reading Board of Korea actually said that they are going to lift the ban, and in 2007 these games will become available.

343
00:24:55,099 --> 00:25:04,602
[SPEAKER_13]: And the head of the rating board, Kim Ki-man, said in the Korea Times, quote, the reasoning behind the decision was said to be to allow freedom of expression.

344
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:06,322
[SPEAKER_13]: So, there you go.

345
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:10,343
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's pretty cool, I think, that, you know, I...

346
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:12,239
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

347
00:25:34,045 --> 00:25:34,425
[SPEAKER_13]: I would hope.

348
00:25:34,585 --> 00:25:35,406
[SPEAKER_13]: I would really, really hope.

349
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:41,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm all for expression and it looks like there's another way to express yourself.

350
00:25:42,229 --> 00:25:45,850
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's by turning your Wii into a vibrator.

351
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Your Wiimote into a vibrator.

352
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:52,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it can be done with the Res Trans Vibrator.

353
00:25:53,494 --> 00:25:58,556
[SPEAKER_08]: We can have the Hello Kitty and I found a Doraemon vibrator on eBay.

354
00:25:58,616 --> 00:25:58,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

355
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:01,449
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a program that's put out by KAKO.

356
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:01,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut up.

357
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,810
[SPEAKER_13]: K-A-K-O.

358
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:33,777
[SPEAKER_08]: You download it to your PC, hook it up to your Bluetooth, and it vibrates on command, I guess.

359
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:36,239
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I want to say, though, there was an easier way to do this.

360
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:41,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone was posting before there was some sort of flaw in the Opera browser.

361
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:45,865
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it was a URL that's too long or something.

362
00:26:45,885 --> 00:26:51,229
[SPEAKER_12]: The tag will cause your browser to crash, and I think it causes the remote to vibrate as well.

363
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:53,071
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that might be an easier way to do that.

364
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:55,472
[SPEAKER_13]: So something easier than using your Kako?

365
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:56,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

366
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:56,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

367
00:26:56,994 --> 00:26:58,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at the guy's site, actually.

368
00:26:58,435 --> 00:27:26,094
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Wii Remote Test, Wii Saber, there's, um, okay, I can't read this, a Wii Braider Test, Wii Mice Test, um, Wii Fall Detect Test, a Wii Remote IR Sensor Test, um, Wii Pointer Test, uh, Wii Nunchaku, I guess Nunchaku Test, um, a bunch of stuff.

369
00:27:26,718 --> 00:27:27,438
[SPEAKER_08]: This is crazy.

370
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:30,500
[SPEAKER_13]: SithSpawn in our chatroom says, set Wiimotes to orgasm.

371
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:37,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm linking this though in the chatroom so that they too can enjoy the Wii Braider.

372
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:39,044
[SPEAKER_12]: The joys of the Wii.

373
00:27:39,864 --> 00:27:46,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, a couple websites out there want you to enjoy the Wii as well.

374
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:48,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially when it comes to porn.

375
00:27:48,948 --> 00:27:54,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, a few websites out there are making their porno...

376
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,130
[SPEAKER_12]: WeFriendly.

377
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, this reminds me.

378
00:27:57,191 --> 00:27:59,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie, did I tell you about what we did on New Year's Eve?

379
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:00,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Orgy?

380
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:00,932
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

381
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,272
[SPEAKER_13]: We had about 12 people over here.

382
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,293
[SPEAKER_13]: You called me drunk.

383
00:28:03,673 --> 00:28:05,534
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we had about 12 people over here.

384
00:28:06,054 --> 00:28:11,336
[SPEAKER_13]: And we had this, you know, somebody that we know had said they'd never seen a porno before.

385
00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:18,518
[SPEAKER_13]: So we decided to use the internet browsing capabilities of the Wii to surf to Pornotube.com and bring it up on the Wii.

386
00:28:18,678 --> 00:28:19,819
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, if you're under 18, don't do this.

387
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:32,595
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, we looked up, let me just say the first thing we clicked on, because we couldn't resist, said pterodactyl porn.

388
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:38,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it really is what it sounds like.

389
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:40,760
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something to behold, I'll give it that.

390
00:28:42,881 --> 00:28:44,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, don't go to that website if you're under 18, kids.

391
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:46,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, Loki, I had to share that.

392
00:28:47,624 --> 00:28:49,785
[SPEAKER_12]: You did use the Wii for pornographic purposes already.

393
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, we've done that a few times.

394
00:28:52,891 --> 00:29:21,885
[SPEAKER_12]: um anyways um so yeah it was a apparently a free one of the free adult sites out there and if you're curious on um wondering what site I'm not really gonna go give them free advertising but it's uh listed on arstechnica.com uh if you go to the free site apparently so you're giving free advertising by proxy yes you make no sense it's a free porn site out there one I have never heard of by the way um

395
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:24,577
[SPEAKER_12]: and doesn't look that good, by the way.

396
00:29:25,657 --> 00:29:29,679
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, so it's free and apparently it's Wii friendly.

397
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:38,724
[SPEAKER_12]: So, it's kind of neat that they're, you know, and usually, you know, it's kind of funny, porn studios are usually ahead of the game for the most part with technology.

398
00:29:38,784 --> 00:29:46,968
[SPEAKER_12]: I know porn studios were the first ones to actually have, I think, DVDs and recordable VHS stuff as well.

399
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:51,410
[SPEAKER_12]: And now that they're, you know, kind of making content for the PSP and the Wii and

400
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:53,969
[SPEAKER_12]: God knows what other browsers out there.

401
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:56,171
[SPEAKER_12]: So, not a huge surprise.

402
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:57,352
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of cool, though.

403
00:29:58,493 --> 00:30:01,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Just think of all the porn sites that are going to use that play on the Wii name.

404
00:30:02,497 --> 00:30:09,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Just think of all the Fox News stories we're going to see about how the Wii is a gateway to porno for your children.

405
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:11,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Wah, evil.

406
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:17,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes I wish this next guy would just go away.

407
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,831
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a story about Uwe Boll.

408
00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:20,584
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

409
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:50,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, couldn't help myself.

410
00:30:50,993 --> 00:30:54,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Because this is already a big franchise for them and they want to keep it going.

411
00:30:54,557 --> 00:30:57,921
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they will be more involved in the whole process than the other companies before.

412
00:30:58,342 --> 00:30:59,683
[SPEAKER_13]: We always want to make a good movie.

413
00:31:03,287 --> 00:31:08,333
[SPEAKER_13]: In the past, the game companies never co-promoted the movie or even had a new game come out with a movie.

414
00:31:09,412 --> 00:31:13,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Uwe, those guys could have promoted the movies all they wanted to.

415
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:19,641
[SPEAKER_13]: They could have had the money pouring out their butts, but if the movie sucked, that's not going to suddenly make the movie better.

416
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:28,789
[SPEAKER_13]: There's probably a reason they didn't promote the movie, because when they saw it, they probably said, why did we ever sign over the rights to this god-awful man?

417
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:31,572
[SPEAKER_12]: I could fart a better movie than he could direct.

418
00:31:31,592 --> 00:31:36,356
[SPEAKER_12]: They included free copies of the PC version of Blood Rain, and it's still in that cell, Blood Rain, the DVD.

419
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:40,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, actually, I guess the BloodRayne DVD sold okay, but that's because no one saw it in the theaters.

420
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:42,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Because everyone heard that one chick was naked.

421
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,612
[SPEAKER_12]: I bet you that's why they sold two million copies.

422
00:31:45,932 --> 00:31:50,995
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, do like the rest of us and just see it on a website for free.

423
00:31:53,257 --> 00:31:58,740
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, it's kind of funny that he mentions Far Cry and stuff, because I really hope they don't kill that franchise.

424
00:31:59,061 --> 00:32:05,745
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, they can go ahead and kill all these other ones that have been dead for a long time, but just stay away from any of the good franchises.

425
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:14,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Whenever Uwe Boll manages to make its way into our show script for what stories we're going to read, I feel a little dead inside.

426
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:20,020
[SPEAKER_13]: That makes me very angsty, so I think it's an appropriate time for us to bring on the FUs of the week, don't you think?

427
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

428
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:35,571
[SPEAKER_08]: FU goes towards money.

429
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:38,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn money.

430
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn having to pay for everything.

431
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:45,583
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, I am an advocate of working hard for the things that you want.

432
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:54,910
[SPEAKER_08]: But damn the fact that I have to shell out $415 tomorrow to pay for my first deposit for school and my books.

433
00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:00,213
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I have to do another $285 and another $285 and another $285 until I'm done.

434
00:33:01,014 --> 00:33:02,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I'll be done at the end of March.

435
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:10,810
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, a $1400 gamble to make an extra $17,000 a year working less hours is awfully nice.

436
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:16,771
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, that's a lot of money right now.

437
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:19,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I got a few rents.

438
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:21,772
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, fuck money.

439
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:25,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Blackboy says, boohoo, DarkSakura has to pay for school.

440
00:33:25,512 --> 00:33:27,453
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, I've been paying for school.

441
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:32,154
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been in college now off and on over the past 10, 11 years or so.

442
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:36,637
[SPEAKER_08]: and I finally found something that... That's a lot of off and on.

443
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:37,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you know what?

444
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:40,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I found something that I really, really want to do.

445
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,961
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that it'll pay off.

446
00:33:44,741 --> 00:33:51,885
[SPEAKER_08]: But for right now, you know, I'm entitled to sit back, look at this and say, how the hell am I going to steam this?

447
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:54,206
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I'm going to make it work.

448
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:54,886
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be worth it.

449
00:33:54,906 --> 00:33:59,148
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time... Now you just got called a career student.

450
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:00,949
[SPEAKER_08]: I am... You know what?

451
00:34:01,449 --> 00:34:03,250
[SPEAKER_08]: My theory is to never stop learning.

452
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:11,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, the moment that you stop learning and let yourself fall into stagnant ignorance is the day you should just shoot yourself in the head.

453
00:34:11,727 --> 00:34:16,890
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's a good thing we fill your head full of news every week on this program so you can consistently learn something new.

454
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:19,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I am proud to be a career student.

455
00:34:19,372 --> 00:34:24,055
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter how long I work, no matter what I do, I'm still going to be learning something.

456
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:27,117
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a teacher, kind of, so did I get props?

457
00:34:27,257 --> 00:34:27,537
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

458
00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:29,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Go to school.

459
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:30,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

460
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:33,301
[SPEAKER_12]: One lesson I hope that was learned today was...

461
00:34:33,945 --> 00:34:43,091
[SPEAKER_12]: The kids out front of your apartment complex, fuck you them for being dumb enough to leave their remote-controlled car parked in an empty space.

462
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:47,053
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I pulled my car in there, I crushed the car and the kid cried.

463
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,175
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just like, my car, it's crushed!

464
00:34:50,235 --> 00:34:52,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you're a dumbass and you left it in the space.

465
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:55,298
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel no remorse for you.

466
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,602
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll teach you to put away your damn toys and stop playing in the goddamn streets.

467
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:03,859
[SPEAKER_13]: If I went to stripping school, would that count?

468
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:04,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

469
00:35:04,939 --> 00:35:05,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.

470
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,200
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd be learning a skill.

471
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:08,701
[SPEAKER_13]: A necessary job function.

472
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:11,243
[SPEAKER_08]: They could eventually make you, like, a dollar.

473
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:13,984
[SPEAKER_10]: I would probably make more money doing that than I do what I do now.

474
00:35:14,944 --> 00:35:16,565
[SPEAKER_13]: I gotta lose my little pooch here.

475
00:35:16,585 --> 00:35:20,207
[SPEAKER_08]: If you do exercise, if you do exercise, and you get free drinks.

476
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:21,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe I should look into it.

477
00:35:21,428 --> 00:35:24,209
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't want to have to grow my hair out to look like Thunder Down Under.

478
00:35:24,229 --> 00:35:25,050
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to wax.

479
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's true.

480
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,112
[SPEAKER_13]: We're talking about that over a bagel this morning.

481
00:35:29,772 --> 00:35:31,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is this on our program?

482
00:35:31,393 --> 00:35:31,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Um,

483
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:41,235
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to say an F you to these kettle chips that are Tuscan three cheese flavor because I've almost eaten the whole freaking bag sitting right here and that's not healthy.

484
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:50,160
[SPEAKER_13]: I love how I'm talking about exercising and working out and I'm like, and I just ate a whole bag of potato chips and I wonder why I'm fat.

485
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:53,221
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like really good chips though.

486
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:54,782
[SPEAKER_13]: An F you to having no self-control.

487
00:35:56,403 --> 00:35:56,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Kill me now.

488
00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:57,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thanks.

489
00:35:57,924 --> 00:35:59,044
[SPEAKER_08]: They're really good chips though.

490
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:00,825
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like the best chips in the world.

491
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:01,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Kill me now.

492
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:01,846
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to die.

493
00:36:02,506 --> 00:36:05,788
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

494
00:36:25,328 --> 00:36:33,811
[SPEAKER_08]: There is actually, they were actually saying that they were, that it was going to be written by Neil Gaiman, but he's actually said on his blog that he actually doesn't really have any involvement in it.

495
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:41,214
[SPEAKER_08]: From what I understand, I think he might be a consultant, but I don't think he's actually involved much in the actual thing.

496
00:36:41,254 --> 00:36:43,855
[SPEAKER_08]: But hey, Silent Hill, happy.

497
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,417
[SPEAKER_13]: You probably like the movie more than anyone else I know.

498
00:36:47,777 --> 00:36:49,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen it four times in the theater.

499
00:36:49,038 --> 00:36:49,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god.

500
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:52,039
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to be buying the Blu-ray disc soon.

501
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:52,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

502
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:57,551
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can turn off all the lights and go... Worship Pyramid Head?

503
00:36:57,651 --> 00:36:58,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Build a Shrine of Fire?

504
00:36:59,495 --> 00:37:02,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why everyone thinks that I'm this big Red Pyramid fangirl.

505
00:37:03,282 --> 00:37:03,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you are.

506
00:37:04,885 --> 00:37:05,165
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

507
00:37:06,898 --> 00:37:11,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the entire story, the entire feel of the game.

508
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:13,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the whole mythology behind it.

509
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:18,726
[SPEAKER_13]: But Pyramid Head, Red Pyramid, whatever, symbolizes all of that in one fancy little hot body.

510
00:37:18,746 --> 00:37:22,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Pyramid is the guy in the second game's repressed sexuality.

511
00:37:22,488 --> 00:37:25,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he goes around raping all the female monsters.

512
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:25,891
[SPEAKER_08]: OMG, spoilers!

513
00:37:26,451 --> 00:37:27,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, come on.

514
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:29,913
[SPEAKER_08]: The game's been out for, what, five years?

515
00:37:30,974 --> 00:37:32,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I think people should know by now.

516
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:33,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what?

517
00:37:33,696 --> 00:37:33,916
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

518
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:36,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Pyramid kills Dumbledore.

519
00:37:38,393 --> 00:37:39,194
[SPEAKER_08]: You're done.

520
00:37:39,334 --> 00:37:41,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of jokes that are years old, thank you for that.

521
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:49,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, so something that doesn't have to do with rape or Silent Hill.

522
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Nintendo was... All of them, forget it.

523
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:52,682
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to hear it.

524
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:54,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving on.

525
00:37:54,623 --> 00:37:55,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Just kidding.

526
00:37:55,558 --> 00:38:03,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Nintendo has partnered up with MMO producer Nexen, and really there's no news other than just that.

527
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:16,004
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't really know why they partner up, but it seems to be that the general consensus is they're working on new MapleStory, MapleStory DS, or possibly MapleStory Wii.

528
00:38:16,404 --> 00:38:17,344
[SPEAKER_12]: So that should be interesting.

529
00:38:18,245 --> 00:38:23,086
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm always for more games, and especially if it's going to be an MMO, that would be pretty cool too.

530
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:29,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Why am I not surprised that if Nintendo was going to partner up with any MMO maker, it would be the folks that made MapleStory?

531
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,126
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very interesting.

532
00:38:31,387 --> 00:38:34,108
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think we might have in store for us on the Wii?

533
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:37,951
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never thought of an MMO on a Nintendo system.

534
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:41,993
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's never really happened before, with the exception of Phantasy Star Online on the GameCube.

535
00:38:42,294 --> 00:38:45,055
[SPEAKER_13]: But let's face it, Nintendo really didn't support that the way they should have.

536
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:51,039
[SPEAKER_13]: So that fluke aside, there's not really been MMOs on Nintendo systems that I can think of.

537
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:52,400
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is very interesting to me.

538
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:54,304
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I don't know.

539
00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:59,125
[SPEAKER_12]: I was surprised that they weren't actually partnering up.

540
00:38:59,145 --> 00:39:00,285
[SPEAKER_12]: What was that one wiki?

541
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:09,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that kind of looked very similar to Wind Waker, so that would be kind of funny if they took that over and made a game based on that.

542
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:17,529
[SPEAKER_12]: But MapleStory, based on the graphics of the game and stuff, I think that it would fit on Nintendo console pretty well.

543
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,630
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to see it as a Wii game because I think you might need a little bit more

544
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:27,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Processor Power to actually put out the graphics and stuff.

545
00:39:27,237 --> 00:39:29,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus, I don't know how well a DS MMO would work.

546
00:39:29,858 --> 00:39:31,338
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially if you've got to pay for it.

547
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:32,418
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't know unless you try.

548
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:33,158
[SPEAKER_13]: True.

549
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,219
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, who knows what they could come out with.

550
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:39,380
[SPEAKER_13]: I would think a game like Ragnarok might actually work really well in the DS.

551
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Sad but true.

552
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Be very interesting.

553
00:39:43,401 --> 00:39:51,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, one thing we resolved to do in the year 2007 is that we're not showing PC gaming enough love on this program and some folks have brought that to our attention.

554
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:52,562
[SPEAKER_13]: PC Gaming Stories

555
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:13,131
[SPEAKER_13]: and this actually was recently announced by PC Gamer and PC Zone Magazines.

556
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:20,657
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a new Oblivion expansion on the way called The Shivering Isles and it only has been confirmed, well, through this, for the PC so far.

557
00:40:20,697 --> 00:40:22,338
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't know if this is going to come out on 360 yet.

558
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:23,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think it is.

559
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:25,040
[SPEAKER_13]: I imagine it would.

560
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,361
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Oblivion does very well on the 360, but

561
00:40:27,478 --> 00:40:30,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, for now we know it's probably going to make its way to the PC.

562
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:37,526
[SPEAKER_13]: It will let players explore the Isles, which are divided into northern and southern areas titled Mania and Dementia.

563
00:40:37,886 --> 00:40:39,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Boy, this sounds like a fun place to go.

564
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:45,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you'll be able to go to a door on this... The way you get there is you go through this door...

565
00:40:46,332 --> 00:40:47,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

566
00:41:07,344 --> 00:41:08,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the new monsters in the game.

567
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:09,445
[SPEAKER_13]: The Gatekeeper.

568
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:12,487
[SPEAKER_13]: A collection of body parts that have been stitched together.

569
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:13,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

570
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,509
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Knights of the Order, which are made up of three roots.

571
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,971
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm surprised you're not playing more Oblivion.

572
00:41:18,991 --> 00:41:20,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you can set fire to anything in that game, Jamie.

573
00:41:21,632 --> 00:41:22,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Play more Oblivion?

574
00:41:23,173 --> 00:41:26,075
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I mean, I know you haven't even played it really at all.

575
00:41:26,135 --> 00:41:28,657
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm surprised by that, because I would think you'd enjoy it.

576
00:41:28,997 --> 00:41:29,677
[SPEAKER_13]: But maybe it's just me.

577
00:41:29,817 --> 00:41:31,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm not going to have any time over the next three months, that's for sure.

578
00:41:33,453 --> 00:41:33,873
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess, yeah.

579
00:41:33,973 --> 00:41:35,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye life.

580
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:40,595
[SPEAKER_13]: As if your life hadn't been sucked away enough into Oblivion as it is if you've been playing this game.

581
00:41:40,955 --> 00:41:44,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Now they're just going to have this, which is even more hours gone away.

582
00:41:44,596 --> 00:41:46,756
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amazing the types of things that people made for Oblivion.

583
00:41:46,776 --> 00:41:51,017
[SPEAKER_13]: There's an Oblivion wiki out there, a Google Map style thing for Oblivion.

584
00:41:51,517 --> 00:41:52,098
[SPEAKER_13]: It's crazy.

585
00:41:53,018 --> 00:41:53,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Excuse me, it's crazy.

586
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:54,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Bless you.

587
00:41:55,118 --> 00:41:55,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

588
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:56,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Live radio.

589
00:41:57,299 --> 00:41:57,719
[SPEAKER_13]: We sneeze.

590
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I have some news.

591
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,280
[SPEAKER_13]: PC related?

592
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:15,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, yep, Sony Online Entertainment is releasing, they actually have the open beta for Vanguard Saga of Heroes.

593
00:42:16,798 --> 00:42:29,610
[SPEAKER_08]: It was available on the 5th, and they also have a pre-order campaign that's given to anyone who is given access to the open beta.

594
00:42:30,683 --> 00:42:39,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the websites have had a lot of coverage on this Vanguard game, and it looks like it could be pretty interesting if you're into those types of PC MMOs.

595
00:42:39,926 --> 00:42:43,168
[SPEAKER_13]: So I might check it out if I have some time, if I can pull myself away from Oblivion.

596
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:44,168
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of pretty.

597
00:42:44,748 --> 00:42:44,888
Yeah.

598
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:57,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, one game I'm looking forward to, especially even on the PC, and I know they're making a 360 version, which is awesome, but Command & Conquer 3, Tiberian Wars, they're going to get a special edition called the Kane Edition.

599
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,854
[SPEAKER_12]: And for those who may not have played Command & Conquer...

600
00:43:00,253 --> 00:43:02,814
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

601
00:43:22,757 --> 00:43:35,141
[SPEAKER_12]: and exclusive in-game content, which is kind of cool, as well as strategy guides, deleted scenes, and bloopers from the game's live-action sequences.

602
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:44,224
[SPEAKER_12]: And, of course, some of the exclusive content, you'll get exclusive multiplayer maps, three exclusive unit skins, and a limited edition poster.

603
00:43:45,524 --> 00:43:47,585
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that'll be pretty cool.

604
00:43:49,547 --> 00:43:55,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Going back to something I said earlier, because I'm reading the comments in the chat room right now, ShadowsLiar says, Sky, how is that crazy?

605
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:59,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Many games have their own wiki, in reference to what I was saying, that Oblivion has all that crazy stuff out there.

606
00:44:00,112 --> 00:44:01,112
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's true.

607
00:44:01,332 --> 00:44:07,915
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there are a lot of fan communities, with wiki being open source and everything, many fan communities throw up their own wiki.

608
00:44:08,275 --> 00:44:11,657
[SPEAKER_13]: But I guess I felt like the Oblivion one just felt so vast.

609
00:44:11,697 --> 00:44:14,118
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, because there's so much in that freaking game.

610
00:44:14,158 --> 00:44:17,019
[SPEAKER_13]: There's not a lot of games I can recall playing that...

611
00:44:17,299 --> 00:44:19,581
[SPEAKER_13]: The PC version can get them all run around topless.

612
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:42,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you did the mods and everything on the PC one, too.

613
00:44:42,072 --> 00:44:47,734
[SPEAKER_13]: I really should be playing Oblivion on the PC, not the 360, but I'm such an achievement points whore, I can't help myself.

614
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:49,775
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I really do want to get the Oblivion now for the PC.

615
00:44:49,835 --> 00:44:50,155
[SPEAKER_12]: You should.

616
00:44:50,175 --> 00:44:51,455
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you should put it on my laptop.

617
00:44:52,235 --> 00:44:52,536
[SPEAKER_12]: Might be.

618
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:53,676
[SPEAKER_12]: I can put the mods in.

619
00:44:54,216 --> 00:44:55,497
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I'm all about, is mods.

620
00:44:56,057 --> 00:44:58,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, so PC gamers, don't say we don't love you.

621
00:44:58,077 --> 00:45:02,439
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, another thing maybe we need to resolve to do is give a little love to

622
00:45:03,303 --> 00:45:04,004
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

623
00:45:21,764 --> 00:45:25,067
[SPEAKER_13]: But unfortunately, the only mobile story we got for you this week is a little bit of a downer.

624
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:33,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Microsoft is being sued by a French company, Infusio, for the wrongful termination of a $2 million contract.

625
00:45:34,033 --> 00:45:43,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Infusio is claiming that Microsoft was refusing to approve their game designs, wrongfully withholding the second of four $500,000 US dollar payments.

626
00:45:44,301 --> 00:45:50,105
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is all in regards to the Halo mobile game that I suppose is in development, so...

627
00:45:51,044 --> 00:45:51,684
[SPEAKER_13]: and DarkSakura.

628
00:46:27,086 --> 00:46:30,188
[SPEAKER_08]: The first email comes from Tim Surugi.

629
00:46:31,449 --> 00:46:32,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, LLR.

630
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, loving the show and hoping it never ends.

631
00:46:35,112 --> 00:46:35,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Never.

632
00:46:36,173 --> 00:46:39,915
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always nice to hear y'all's charming personalities shine every week.

633
00:46:40,536 --> 00:46:44,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm terribly sorry for bothering y'all, but Sky's suggestion got me thinking about gambling games for the Wii.

634
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,983
[SPEAKER_08]: If Nintendo ever decides to get on the ball and make some Wii DS connectivity set up,

635
00:46:50,526 --> 00:46:55,889
[SPEAKER_08]: You could very easily expand the playability of Wii gambling titles, such as playing poker or blackjack.

636
00:46:56,409 --> 00:47:00,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Combine this with online capabilities, and I believe there could be a fulfilling Wii title.

637
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:02,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Heck, Wii clubhouse games, why not?

638
00:47:03,873 --> 00:47:11,657
[SPEAKER_08]: The point is Nintendo's stubborn lack of celerity in grasping the online world is mind-bogglingly nonsensical.

639
00:47:12,337 --> 00:47:15,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Given Xbox 360's success through live, Nintendo could really take a hint.

640
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:19,681
[SPEAKER_08]: On a side note, a four-star sequel utilizing Wii DS connectivity would

641
00:47:20,535 --> 00:47:21,316
[SPEAKER_08]: JustPlainRock.

642
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for being so awesome and putting up with my annoying emails.

643
00:47:25,098 --> 00:47:25,479
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

644
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:29,442
[SPEAKER_08]: You think Nintendo could reach out to the older community with games like Wii R Old?

645
00:47:30,462 --> 00:47:33,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to get some mad shuffleboard action going on.

646
00:47:35,106 --> 00:47:35,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Wii Old!

647
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:40,089
[SPEAKER_13]: To give credit where credit is due, wasn't that your idea, Loki, for the gambling games on the Wii?

648
00:47:40,109 --> 00:47:40,830
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember.

649
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:41,951
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember saying that.

650
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:42,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe I did.

651
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:44,612
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I never said anything about gambling games.

652
00:47:44,793 --> 00:47:45,893
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well, I guess I did.

653
00:47:46,093 --> 00:47:48,895
[SPEAKER_12]: They have, was it World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions?

654
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:49,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that sucks.

655
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I think they're talking, we're talking like real money being gambled.

656
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:58,322
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, I think that would be a gray area that Nintendo, you know... Technically, gambling is illegal in Japan.

657
00:47:58,723 --> 00:48:00,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that and that, think about that.

658
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:07,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Usually those online gambling sites, you kind of associate that with shadiness.

659
00:48:07,949 --> 00:48:11,512
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, like, you know, there's so many of them out there and you always kind of see the pop-up ads and you go...

660
00:48:12,012 --> 00:48:12,993
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a little shady to me.

661
00:48:13,033 --> 00:48:13,853
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I want to get in.

662
00:48:13,893 --> 00:48:17,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Not to knock it if that's what you're into, but I'm sure you've done the research if you're going to spend money on it.

663
00:48:18,176 --> 00:48:20,858
[SPEAKER_13]: But you have to admit, there's a lot of crap out there that seems really shady.

664
00:48:21,218 --> 00:48:25,861
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wouldn't think Nintendo would want to damage their reputation with that.

665
00:48:26,221 --> 00:48:40,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, along the lines of what you say, like clubhouse games and those types of very casual games, I think Xbox Live hit a goldmine with Uno, and I think Nintendo, if they were smart, would be quick to get out a version of clubhouse games on the Wii or something like that.

666
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,471
[SPEAKER_13]: That kind of latches on to that where people could really do it.

667
00:48:43,771 --> 00:48:50,073
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time, I don't know if Wii is set up for that same type of online greatness, at least in what we know.

668
00:48:50,113 --> 00:48:53,313
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there might be unannounced things we don't know of yet, like there was on DS.

669
00:48:53,554 --> 00:48:56,814
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't know that we'd be able to talk on the DS in certain games.

670
00:48:57,595 --> 00:49:06,097
[SPEAKER_13]: But Microsoft really has this rock-solid thing set up with Live, and Nintendo is being a little slow about competing with that.

671
00:49:06,317 --> 00:49:09,598
[SPEAKER_13]: And the longer they take, the further ahead

672
00:49:10,694 --> 00:49:11,294
[SPEAKER_13]: The next email says,

673
00:49:38,146 --> 00:49:44,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Just thought I'd add to the anecdotal evidence that the PS3 is not selling as well as Sony and the mainstream media would like you to believe.

674
00:49:45,553 --> 00:49:53,140
[SPEAKER_08]: In my continuing search for the Wii, I stopped into the usual big box stores, as well as GameStop, EB Games, locations in my area fairly regularly.

675
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,903
[SPEAKER_08]: This Saturday morning, I got up early and made my rounds once again.

676
00:49:57,384 --> 00:50:04,030
[SPEAKER_08]: At every stop on my journey, EB Games, Target, Walmart, Circuit City, Best Buy, there were PS3s to be had, but not a single Wii in sight.

677
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:08,634
[SPEAKER_08]: The Best Buy still has PS3s in stock from last week's flyer announcement.

678
00:50:09,135 --> 00:50:25,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I find this quite interesting and have to believe that the way too high price point, lack of killer apps, and mounting bad press is really affecting the PS3 sales, while, at least at this moment, the Wii has all the momentum necessary to sell every single unit put on the shelf, with people clamoring for more.

679
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Two other small tidbits to note from the Saturday trip.

680
00:50:29,431 --> 00:50:31,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I was not the only person scavenging the stores for the Wii.

681
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:39,000
[SPEAKER_08]: At several of my stops, I saw the same early 40s lady and her mother also hoping to score an early morning Wii.

682
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:39,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Pardon the pun.

683
00:50:40,441 --> 00:50:49,869
[SPEAKER_08]: The other tidbit is that while I was wandering aimlessly through the Target, a woman came in, purchased an Xbox 360 system while bypassing the two 60 gigabyte PS3s on display.

684
00:50:49,969 --> 00:50:50,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Sony.

685
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep up the good work on the podcast.

686
00:50:52,631 --> 00:50:58,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Your show is one of the two or three I look forward to every week as it makes my daily grind that much easier to bear.

687
00:50:58,456 --> 00:50:59,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks and take care.

688
00:50:59,997 --> 00:51:00,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Boston OLR fan.

689
00:51:02,011 --> 00:51:02,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thank you.

690
00:51:03,472 --> 00:51:06,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we kind of got into it a little bit earlier on the show.

691
00:51:06,213 --> 00:51:14,636
[SPEAKER_13]: I think now that Christmas is over, I don't think the demand for the PlayStation 3 is so much there, and I think the media fear has a lot to do with that.

692
00:51:15,216 --> 00:51:16,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Very interesting, though.

693
00:51:16,077 --> 00:51:18,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the Nintendo is still going.

694
00:51:18,538 --> 00:51:20,478
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, I'd be very interested to see.

695
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:25,520
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we know that Nintendo has more systems out there at this time than Nintendo or Xbox did this far out.

696
00:51:25,761 --> 00:51:28,522
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, than Sony or Microsoft did this far out after launch.

697
00:51:29,042 --> 00:51:29,262
[SPEAKER_13]: But

698
00:51:30,241 --> 00:51:32,582
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think it would be interesting still to see the comparison there.

699
00:51:33,322 --> 00:51:38,164
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do think it is pretty obvious that Nintendo's kicking some serious booty right now.

700
00:51:38,885 --> 00:51:39,605
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's price.

701
00:51:39,845 --> 00:51:40,845
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all about the price.

702
00:51:41,826 --> 00:51:42,626
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's a quickie.

703
00:51:42,706 --> 00:51:43,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a random wee question.

704
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,827
[SPEAKER_08]: What do they call the nunchuck attachment in England?

705
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:47,248
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it's still called the nunchuck.

706
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I still think is a... Who is that from?

707
00:51:50,669 --> 00:51:51,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Same person?

708
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:52,030
[SPEAKER_08]: No, different person.

709
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:53,390
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't signed.

710
00:51:54,971 --> 00:51:59,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't read out email addresses or names through email, so if it's not signed, I won't say your name.

711
00:52:00,323 --> 00:52:04,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, OLR, I've been an avid listener of your show ever since I heard my friends talk about it around episode 175.

712
00:52:20,413 --> 00:52:20,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my bad.

713
00:52:41,255 --> 00:52:42,576
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

714
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:02,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, OLR.

715
00:53:02,484 --> 00:53:03,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, it's me, Neki.

716
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:05,706
[SPEAKER_08]: The New Year show was great, by the way.

717
00:53:05,947 --> 00:53:06,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

718
00:53:06,307 --> 00:53:06,747
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fun.

719
00:53:06,947 --> 00:53:07,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

720
00:53:08,308 --> 00:53:11,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Has anyone heard the news about the PSP Lite?

721
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:16,815
[SPEAKER_08]: I was also included a link from NewstechSpy.com.

722
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:23,260
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of the URL is articles06, sonypsi.html.

723
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,283
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii is very hard to find over here at the moment and is a right pain.

724
00:53:27,683 --> 00:53:29,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't find any store with any in stock yet.

725
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:31,913
[SPEAKER_08]: for £180.

726
00:53:32,153 --> 00:53:38,575
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to say, though, I was very tempted to get an Xbox 360 after playing Saints Row yesterday.

727
00:53:39,055 --> 00:53:42,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I should get a 360 now and get a Wii later when there's better games out.

728
00:53:42,776 --> 00:53:43,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Your thoughts?

729
00:53:43,996 --> 00:53:46,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm enjoying my DS at the moment and hoping to keep doing so.

730
00:53:47,317 --> 00:53:49,837
[SPEAKER_08]: If you haven't already, check out Metroid Prime Hunters on DS.

731
00:53:49,917 --> 00:53:50,317
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fun.

732
00:53:50,357 --> 00:53:51,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk to you later, Neki.

733
00:53:52,478 --> 00:53:53,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for the email.

734
00:53:54,997 --> 00:53:59,420
[SPEAKER_13]: There was something in there I was going to say, and now I forgot because I got sidetracked.

735
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Just buying a 360 now and get a Wii later?

736
00:54:04,213 --> 00:54:05,154
[SPEAKER_13]: 3.60s are really good.

737
00:54:05,214 --> 00:54:13,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, it all comes down to, and if you've been listening to the show for any length of time, we always say this, the golden rule of gaming is a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

738
00:54:13,539 --> 00:54:14,579
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the golden rule of gaming.

739
00:54:14,879 --> 00:54:17,561
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's really about what types of games do you want to be playing right now.

740
00:54:17,601 --> 00:54:22,063
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to play Zelda, you want to play Trauma Center, you want to play WarioWare, you've got to go for the Wii.

741
00:54:22,184 --> 00:54:32,650
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to be playing, I mean, you said you played Saints Row, and if that was fun to you, and you want to play other types of sandbox games like that that are on their way to 3.60s, such as Grand Theft Auto later this year, you've got to go for the Wii.

742
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:44,253
[SPEAKER_13]: and some of the other Gears of War whatever else 360 has to offer Oblivion, Pinata, whatever maybe that's the system for you and if you're an online gamer

743
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,241
[SPEAKER_13]: 360 is where it's at.

744
00:54:46,601 --> 00:54:51,966
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have a soft spot in your heart for the retro classics, Wii is where it's at for the Nintendo stuff.

745
00:54:51,986 --> 00:54:54,067
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's really about what you want.

746
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:55,749
[SPEAKER_13]: But be careful.

747
00:54:55,829 --> 00:55:02,454
[SPEAKER_13]: I know how sometimes money burns a hole in your pocket and it makes you make rash decisions, and I've done this many, many times, especially with game purchases.

748
00:55:02,835 --> 00:55:08,299
[SPEAKER_13]: But you'll thank yourself if you take five minutes to really think about what you buy before you buy it.

749
00:55:10,117 --> 00:55:19,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Saka's last email Hi guys, hope your new years was good and either peaceful or eventful in a good way that's a nice way to phrase it um

750
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:26,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a long thought to state, but considering my throat is coughing up furballs and other dryness, I figured just to get into it.

751
00:55:26,305 --> 00:55:31,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Playing OEB Agents, I've managed to get to the third difficulty level and noticed something.

752
00:55:31,688 --> 00:55:41,294
[SPEAKER_08]: The final songs in particular, Without a Fight and the Jumpin' Jack Flash cover, I noticed how it just matched the mood of the scenario, even getting goosebumps when the songs were being played.

753
00:55:41,815 --> 00:55:46,458
[SPEAKER_08]: It got me to think about some of the boss slash climactic battles in video games over the years.

754
00:55:47,216 --> 00:55:50,118
[SPEAKER_08]: How listening to the music just adds to the battle to make it more memorable.

755
00:55:50,499 --> 00:55:53,701
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was wondering what were some of your favorite songs used in boss battles?

756
00:55:54,282 --> 00:56:01,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's all for now as my throat is causing me to my head to be cloudy right now.

757
00:56:02,308 --> 00:56:03,509
[SPEAKER_08]: See you guys at the chat room.

758
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:04,851
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a DDR dollar bill.

759
00:56:06,352 --> 00:56:09,454
[SPEAKER_08]: You've actually become one of my good Doctor Who fandom buddies.

760
00:56:10,455 --> 00:56:11,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, uh...

761
00:56:12,455 --> 00:56:16,159
[SPEAKER_13]: And what you say there, again, is another great... I actually agree.

762
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:18,981
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought those songs fit the mood so well in Lead Beat Agents.

763
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:25,608
[SPEAKER_13]: And yet another reason why I think it is a travesty that that game is not ending up on more best of 06 lists.

764
00:56:25,688 --> 00:56:28,891
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was seriously one of the absolute best games.

765
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,513
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, it's better than Guitar Hero 2.

766
00:56:30,953 --> 00:56:31,233
[SPEAKER_13]: It is.

767
00:56:31,494 --> 00:56:31,994
[SPEAKER_13]: It really is.

768
00:56:33,335 --> 00:56:43,418
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's my opinion, take it or leave it, but I think the game is being horribly underlooked, and I think people are passing off the song list without really sitting down and trying it.

769
00:56:43,718 --> 00:56:51,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'll tell you what, if you got turned off by the fact that it has Ashley Simpson, La La, or Avril Lavigne, Sk8er Boi, trust me, the music fits better than you're giving it credit for.

770
00:56:53,181 --> 00:56:53,962
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, give it a try.

771
00:56:54,062 --> 00:56:54,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Give it a try.

772
00:56:55,003 --> 00:56:56,824
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, those songs really fit the mood.

773
00:56:56,884 --> 00:56:57,524
[SPEAKER_08]: One Winged Angel.

774
00:56:57,685 --> 00:57:00,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was going to say, hello, Final Fantasy VII, One Winged Angel.

775
00:57:00,947 --> 00:57:02,708
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, who doesn't remember, you know, the Sephiroth?

776
00:57:02,748 --> 00:57:06,031
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we still use that music on this program today.

777
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:06,972
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the Advent Children version.

778
00:57:06,992 --> 00:57:09,634
[SPEAKER_13]: That is like the epic boss battle music.

779
00:57:12,697 --> 00:57:15,800
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, yeah, this is the Advent Children one in particular, but, you know, who?

780
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,342
[SPEAKER_13]: What a badass music.

781
00:57:18,502 --> 00:57:26,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember, though, because how long that took, because I did the Knights of the Round Quadra magic combo, just casting it, going and making a sandwich, and hearing one Wing Angel in the background.

782
00:57:26,589 --> 00:57:27,130
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really cool.

783
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:35,577
[SPEAKER_13]: If I want to go way old school, think about some of the 8-bit games that had some great final boss music.

784
00:57:35,937 --> 00:57:42,840
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know, one that sticks out in my mind for whatever awkward reason, I think just one of the first songs I remember, was Remember Super Mario Bros.

785
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:49,002
[SPEAKER_13]: 2, when you finally made it to Wart, and you fought him, and it had some pretty cool final boss battle music.

786
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:50,382
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty cool.

787
00:57:51,222 --> 00:57:52,683
[SPEAKER_13]: It sticks out in my mind for whatever reason.

788
00:57:53,243 --> 00:57:55,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I also do have to say...

789
00:57:57,638 --> 00:58:03,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I really... Oh, and it's how ironic Junami actually just mentioned both of them.

790
00:58:03,803 --> 00:58:09,287
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say all of the Wily stage musics in the various Mega Man, Rock Man games.

791
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:09,908
[SPEAKER_13]: I was noticing that.

792
00:58:09,928 --> 00:58:11,589
[SPEAKER_13]: DMN said that too, yeah.

793
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:20,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I fully, fully agree with... Especially two... The first one actually was even decent, but the Mega Man games just had awesome music, you know, at any rate.

794
00:58:21,037 --> 00:58:22,137
[SPEAKER_08]: I also...

795
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:26,885
[SPEAKER_08]: The Genova Battle in Final Fantasy 7

796
00:58:43,126 --> 00:58:52,168
[SPEAKER_13]: ShadowCharlie says Final Battle Music for Sonic 3 GS68 says Destination Blackout from MT2 Ranma says Bowser Theme from Mario Bros.

797
00:58:52,628 --> 00:58:57,829
[SPEAKER_13]: 3 GS68 says the Final Battle Music from Final Fantasy 4 Lots of different suggestions there.

798
00:58:58,009 --> 00:59:02,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have to agree with the Chrono Trigger ones, just the Lavos battle.

799
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:07,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I especially love just going after you've beaten the game a few times on New Game+.

800
00:59:08,581 --> 00:59:12,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Going back and just doing it right away, and then you get the Maker's ending.

801
00:59:13,484 --> 00:59:15,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Or even better, The Legend of Max.

802
00:59:16,706 --> 00:59:17,166
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

803
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:18,047
[SPEAKER_12]: For DDR?

804
00:59:18,527 --> 00:59:19,027
[SPEAKER_12]: Kinda.

805
00:59:19,427 --> 00:59:19,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Kinda.

806
00:59:20,768 --> 00:59:22,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Guitar Room Man.

807
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:26,772
[SPEAKER_08]: The last level music in Guitar Room Man was pretty hardcore.

808
00:59:26,812 --> 00:59:34,016
[SPEAKER_13]: To me, those songs don't invoke that same emotional response that I think was alluded to in the email, but I don't know.

809
00:59:35,253 --> 00:59:35,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Any more emails?

810
00:59:36,134 --> 00:59:36,494
[SPEAKER_13]: One more?

811
00:59:36,634 --> 00:59:40,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we do have one more email.

812
00:59:41,516 --> 00:59:43,798
[SPEAKER_08]: And this one comes from Holy Shonen.

813
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:48,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear OLR, I'm a huge fan.

814
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:52,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Have enjoyed your show greatly for the past year and a half.

815
00:59:52,302 --> 00:59:53,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Just recently started being in the chat room.

816
00:59:53,903 --> 00:59:54,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't call me a noob.

817
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:56,044
[SPEAKER_08]: We call people noobs.

818
00:59:56,185 --> 00:59:56,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Noob!

819
00:59:56,525 --> 00:59:57,825
[SPEAKER_08]: With the biggest of affection.

820
00:59:57,905 --> 00:59:59,446
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I know, yeah.

821
01:00:00,447 --> 01:00:02,168
[SPEAKER_13]: We say noob less than three.

822
01:00:02,788 --> 01:00:04,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Less than three, that's a heart on its side.

823
01:00:05,612 --> 01:00:08,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I was wondering if you could help me with a problem I'm having.

824
01:00:09,575 --> 01:00:11,676
[SPEAKER_08]: My desktop just died and I need a new one.

825
01:00:12,256 --> 01:00:17,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Since my desktop would be for gaming, music, movies, etc., I was thinking of getting a PC.

826
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:24,765
[SPEAKER_08]: However, since I love my MacBook so much, I thought I could get a good Mac with two operating systems so that my PC-only games actually run on it.

827
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:26,286
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure I need advice.

828
01:00:26,526 --> 01:00:27,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Always weird.

829
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:27,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shonen.

830
01:00:27,907 --> 01:00:28,247
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

831
01:00:28,347 --> 01:00:31,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, I love you, but I cannot support your hatred of Mac computers.

832
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:32,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Smiley.

833
01:00:34,378 --> 01:00:35,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Smiley, Loki, smiley.

834
01:00:36,339 --> 01:00:42,201
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that I was going to do, except it was a little cost prohibitive for me at this junction in my life.

835
01:00:43,401 --> 01:00:52,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, given that I have a massive library of PC-only stuff, and we've got the parts sitting in my garage to actually build me a new computer.

836
01:00:53,285 --> 01:00:58,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to get the 24-inch widescreen iMac and dual-formatted PC and...

837
01:00:59,580 --> 01:00:59,981
[SPEAKER_08]: and Mac.

838
01:01:00,962 --> 01:01:03,344
[SPEAKER_08]: You can run virtual PC as well.

839
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:08,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't know how well it works on the new builds and what is my laptop doing?

840
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:13,234
[SPEAKER_13]: For me, it's a little early for that whole dual format thing for me.

841
01:01:13,274 --> 01:01:16,097
[SPEAKER_13]: It's still kind of a new technology in my mind and I think

842
01:01:16,977 --> 01:01:18,198
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not ready for that, you know?

843
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:21,338
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same as having Linux and Windows on the same box.

844
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:21,919
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same.

845
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:23,759
[SPEAKER_13]: But I wouldn't do that to my machine.

846
01:01:24,019 --> 01:01:26,260
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same as having two different versions of Windows.

847
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:27,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Look, let me just put it this way.

848
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:33,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Me, personally, I have a... I don't even know the name of my frickin' little... What is that, an iBook?

849
01:01:33,802 --> 01:01:34,242
[SPEAKER_13]: The laptop?

850
01:01:34,262 --> 01:01:34,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you have an iBook.

851
01:01:35,062 --> 01:01:35,623
[SPEAKER_13]: I have an iBook.

852
01:01:36,063 --> 01:01:38,824
[SPEAKER_13]: I have an iBook, and I just call it my Apple laptop.

853
01:01:38,844 --> 01:01:41,424
[SPEAKER_13]: I have an iBook, and I have a PC desktop, and I love it.

854
01:01:41,644 --> 01:01:42,465
[SPEAKER_13]: I love that setup.

855
01:01:42,645 --> 01:01:43,845
[SPEAKER_13]: I have the best of both worlds.

856
01:01:44,491 --> 01:01:45,772
[SPEAKER_13]: I recommend folks do the same.

857
01:01:46,052 --> 01:01:46,633
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's great.

858
01:01:47,113 --> 01:01:47,713
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a great combo.

859
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:53,898
[SPEAKER_08]: The only real reason that I was really wanting the Mac stuff myself is being a graphic artist.

860
01:01:54,479 --> 01:01:58,962
[SPEAKER_08]: But honestly, I've done great quality work on my PC.

861
01:02:00,123 --> 01:02:03,705
[SPEAKER_08]: At this point in my life, it's really a matter of your preference.

862
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:09,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if you are doing graphics professionally, video editing professionally, Mac is the way to go.

863
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:13,793
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're doing it for yourself or casually like me, then I don't see

864
01:02:14,562 --> 01:02:15,642
[SPEAKER_08]: as much of a point in it.

865
01:02:15,902 --> 01:02:17,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're great systems.

866
01:02:17,403 --> 01:02:19,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it just depends on what you want to do with it.

867
01:02:21,084 --> 01:02:22,684
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like how much space they save.

868
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:27,006
[SPEAKER_13]: I got a private message from someone that said, you know, it's just doable booting.

869
01:02:27,046 --> 01:02:28,486
[SPEAKER_13]: What's what's the big reservation?

870
01:02:28,626 --> 01:02:28,946
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

871
01:02:29,006 --> 01:02:31,807
[SPEAKER_13]: I just I still, you know, maybe I'm being stupid with it.

872
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:35,348
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're right that, you know, folks do Linux and Windows and that stuff all the time.

873
01:02:35,408 --> 01:02:36,288
[SPEAKER_13]: So what's the big deal?

874
01:02:36,768 --> 01:02:37,228
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

875
01:02:37,348 --> 01:02:39,009
[SPEAKER_13]: I just I don't.

876
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:40,438
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

877
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:01,681
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing I do use my Macintosh for a lot is I author DVDs.

878
01:03:01,721 --> 01:03:04,821
[SPEAKER_13]: My really good friend John takes a lot of pictures and I make DVDs out of them.

879
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,482
[SPEAKER_13]: The Mac is awesome for that.

880
01:03:06,522 --> 01:03:09,142
[SPEAKER_13]: I love it compared to anything I've tried on the PC.

881
01:03:09,922 --> 01:03:10,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Little things like that.

882
01:03:10,882 --> 01:03:12,423
[SPEAKER_13]: But see, I get all that out of my laptop.

883
01:03:12,463 --> 01:03:14,743
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't have the need for this whole dual boot thing.

884
01:03:14,783 --> 01:03:17,824
[SPEAKER_13]: And to me, it's kind of a waste of resources.

885
01:03:17,884 --> 01:03:18,604
[SPEAKER_13]: For me, personally.

886
01:03:18,624 --> 01:03:21,144
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not criticizing anyone else who wants to do it, but I'm just saying for me.

887
01:03:21,304 --> 01:03:23,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Jaded in here runs for operating systems.

888
01:03:24,285 --> 01:03:25,645
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, what I was thinking about...

889
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:29,539
[SPEAKER_08]: about doing myself, because I actually want to learn Linux a little bit better.

890
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:38,146
[SPEAKER_08]: When we rebuild my new computer, I'm actually going to have two... My plan is to have two 20 gig hard drives in it as my boot drives.

891
01:03:38,987 --> 01:03:54,238
[SPEAKER_08]: One with Linux, one with... My new system is going to be... I can run Vista on it, so I'm taking out my 250 right now, putting it in a USB case, which ironically, the one I'm looking at is called Metal Gear.

892
01:03:54,258 --> 01:03:55,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

893
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:07,078
[SPEAKER_08]: and having that be portable between my laptop and my PC so that anything that I want, anything I need to do, there it is and 20GB will easily store the programs I want to run.

894
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:11,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Any more emails?

895
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,582
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but this proves that we're big dorks.

896
01:04:14,122 --> 01:04:15,003
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess, a little bit.

897
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:21,064
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, if you have more emails you want to send, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send them.

898
01:04:21,144 --> 01:04:28,388
[SPEAKER_13]: And we also offer and welcome interaction through our Skype line, which will be open very soon after another little chunk of stories here.

899
01:04:28,408 --> 01:04:30,350
[SPEAKER_13]: So you might want to get your Skype fired up.

900
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:34,512
[SPEAKER_13]: It's username orangeloungeradio or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

901
01:04:34,532 --> 01:04:35,713
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll let you know when those are open.

902
01:04:36,094 --> 01:04:38,515
[SPEAKER_13]: But we have a couple quick final stories here for you.

903
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:39,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

904
01:04:40,316 --> 01:04:41,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, big one.

905
01:04:42,848 --> 01:04:45,389
[SPEAKER_12]: GameStop purchased Rhino Video Games

906
01:05:12,219 --> 01:05:14,040
[SPEAKER_12]: So, lots of good stuff there.

907
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,783
[SPEAKER_12]: But it is official, the Blockbuster-owned company, Rhino Video Games, has been bought by GameStop.

908
01:05:20,423 --> 01:05:24,525
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, this isn't really huge news, I think.

909
01:05:25,305 --> 01:05:26,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, for you it is.

910
01:05:26,085 --> 01:05:29,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, for me it's not, because we've kind of known that something like this is going to happen.

911
01:05:30,668 --> 01:05:30,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

912
01:05:30,868 --> 01:05:35,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Blockbuster's been entertaining offers for a while now for Rhino Video Games.

913
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,131
[SPEAKER_12]: I know because we sell to them, so...

914
01:05:38,829 --> 01:05:43,091
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of a disappointment to see them being bought up because I hear they're a very good store chain, but

915
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:03,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Where do they exist mostly?

916
01:06:03,449 --> 01:06:04,590
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have them here in California.

917
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:11,453
[SPEAKER_12]: The southeast, no, the southern east, over, you know, north, south Carolina, Georgia, Alabama.

918
01:06:11,493 --> 01:06:13,153
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, I know right now.

919
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:16,635
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's pretty much where, you know, they were located.

920
01:06:17,115 --> 01:06:22,177
[SPEAKER_12]: And, yeah, they had about, I want to say they had like 72 locations, if I remember correctly.

921
01:06:22,277 --> 01:06:25,358
[SPEAKER_13]: See, here in California, we've always had...

922
01:06:25,956 --> 01:06:26,937
[SPEAKER_13]: GameStop, pretty much.

923
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:29,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Because previously we always had Software Etc.

924
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:31,080
[SPEAKER_13]: and Funkoland.

925
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,781
[SPEAKER_13]: Babbage's.

926
01:06:32,821 --> 01:06:34,963
[SPEAKER_13]: They all got absolved.

927
01:06:35,023 --> 01:06:36,604
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember Babbage's here in California.

928
01:06:36,864 --> 01:06:39,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in mind, GameStop is also owned by Barnes & Noble Inc.

929
01:06:41,348 --> 01:06:42,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're a fully owned subsidiary.

930
01:06:42,989 --> 01:06:50,275
[SPEAKER_08]: So Babbage's, since Babbage's was Barnes & Noble's arm for games and tech.

931
01:06:50,295 --> 01:06:55,659
[SPEAKER_13]: The Barnes & Noble's craze, from my recollection, did not really start here in this state until about 10 years ago.

932
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:56,988
[SPEAKER_13]: and that whole thing.

933
01:06:57,389 --> 01:07:00,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Those stores did not start going up until about 10 years ago.

934
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:04,034
[SPEAKER_13]: It was always Walden Books, which is Borders, essentially.

935
01:07:04,734 --> 01:07:08,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, apparently the whole thing's supposed to go down on the 14th.

936
01:07:08,797 --> 01:07:22,147
[SPEAKER_12]: That's when I guess it's going to become official and they're going to start... I don't know if they're going to either convert these stores over to GameStops, which I hear that might be what's going to happen, or if it's going to be like this whole GameStop EB thing where

937
01:07:22,611 --> 01:07:24,232
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

938
01:07:53,661 --> 01:07:55,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I don't know.

939
01:07:55,422 --> 01:07:56,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so, actually.

940
01:07:56,443 --> 01:07:57,544
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been in a movie gallery.

941
01:07:57,564 --> 01:07:57,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet!

942
01:07:58,664 --> 01:08:00,525
[SPEAKER_08]: My dad used to flirt with the lady behind the counter.

943
01:08:00,645 --> 01:08:02,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Just go to Video Clearance Center.

944
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:03,267
[SPEAKER_12]: They have tons of porn there.

945
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:07,109
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, they carry more porn than, I think, actual videos now.

946
01:08:07,549 --> 01:08:11,632
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually said, I went into one and they said they had a green door that you could go behind to buy the porn.

947
01:08:11,952 --> 01:08:12,952
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually had to paint their door.

948
01:08:15,334 --> 01:08:15,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Paint it green?

949
01:08:16,154 --> 01:08:18,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody raised a stink and they had to paint over the green door.

950
01:08:19,336 --> 01:08:19,776
[SPEAKER_12]: With what?

951
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:21,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's purple now.

952
01:08:23,002 --> 01:08:24,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so now it's the purple door.

953
01:08:24,263 --> 01:08:24,583
[SPEAKER_12]: What's it?

954
01:08:25,544 --> 01:08:27,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Going behind the green door to buy, never mind.

955
01:08:28,485 --> 01:08:29,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, anyway, forget it.

956
01:08:29,966 --> 01:08:39,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Look, let's... This is so horrible that we have to follow up that topic with this, but hey, look, it's just the way it was scripted, folks.

957
01:08:40,051 --> 01:08:41,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk about charity.

958
01:08:41,372 --> 01:08:45,694
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll go to the opposite end of the spectrum from buying porn to donating to charity.

959
01:08:47,099 --> 01:08:52,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, one charity a lot of gamers know about is Penny Arcade's Child Play charity.

960
01:08:52,604 --> 01:08:56,387
[SPEAKER_13]: And they raised over $1 million this year.

961
01:08:56,928 --> 01:09:01,291
[SPEAKER_13]: It was posted on the Child's Play website this week that, quote, You guys did it.

962
01:09:01,351 --> 01:09:03,673
[SPEAKER_13]: You broke a million dollars in just over two months.

963
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:09,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Child's Play started as a way to show how good our community can be, but it's turned into something greater than we could have ever imagined.

964
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,240
[SPEAKER_13]: We're making an impact on lives.

965
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,121
[SPEAKER_13]: See you next year.

966
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:14,263
[SPEAKER_08]: They're at $1,024,400.

967
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,004
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

968
01:09:16,124 --> 01:09:16,665
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.

969
01:09:16,745 --> 01:09:17,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

970
01:09:18,206 --> 01:09:35,582
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a damn shame the media won't ever cover that in the same capacity that they cover, I should say, you know, because I'm sure they get a nice, you know, story here and there, but in the same way that, you know, Game Boy Electrocute, Small Child, you know, kids go and shoot up their schools because of video games.

971
01:09:35,642 --> 01:09:37,383
[SPEAKER_12]: It's never going to get that same.

972
01:09:37,764 --> 01:09:39,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Documentary and...

973
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:45,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Not really a document, but that documentary on video game violence called Moral Combat.

974
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,280
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you'd find better quality behind the beaded doors in a movie gallery.

975
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:54,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Behind the purple door.

976
01:09:55,501 --> 01:10:07,203
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate, speaking of quality, and I vote this for quality, Guitar Hero 2 360 is going to have additional content.

977
01:10:07,283 --> 01:10:09,123
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not really saying much about it,

978
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:17,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Rumor has it that it might be new modes, downloadable content, probably for new songs coming out, sort of like how Karaoke Revolution goes.

979
01:10:18,816 --> 01:10:24,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Putting out the original Guitar Hero songs with extra bass or, you know, rhythm guitar.

980
01:10:25,059 --> 01:10:25,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that'd be pretty cool.

981
01:10:28,802 --> 01:10:34,385
[SPEAKER_08]: And it does say, though, right on the box, that there are additional songs and downloadable content.

982
01:10:36,517 --> 01:10:40,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Sweet, I knew there was a reason I was holding out for this game on the 360 and this is exactly why.

983
01:10:41,281 --> 01:10:48,846
[SPEAKER_13]: And yes, I do realize I was saying things that may seem a little anti-Guitar Hero earlier in the show, but I'm really not.

984
01:10:48,926 --> 01:10:53,309
[SPEAKER_13]: I really do like Guitar Hero a lot, I just don't think it's God's gift to gaming.

985
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:56,091
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there were better games that came out in 06 and so on, but

986
01:10:57,591 --> 01:10:58,871
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been holding out to buy this.

987
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:00,872
[SPEAKER_13]: I've played it on PS2, and sure, it's fun.

988
01:11:00,912 --> 01:11:04,213
[SPEAKER_13]: But I've been holding out for 360, and I knew this was why.

989
01:11:04,233 --> 01:11:06,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also going to link in the chat room, though.

990
01:11:07,655 --> 01:11:16,658
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a picture of this up on a Team Xbox site that has what the box art is.

991
01:11:17,298 --> 01:11:18,439
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm posting that right now.

992
01:11:19,999 --> 01:11:20,359
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

993
01:11:20,379 --> 01:11:23,400
[SPEAKER_13]: The box art was very interesting looking to me, I have to say.

994
01:11:24,501 --> 01:11:25,021
[SPEAKER_13]: But very cool.

995
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:25,361
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked it.

996
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:27,196
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking forward to it.

997
01:11:27,256 --> 01:11:28,317
[SPEAKER_08]: You know I'm going to get it anyway.

998
01:11:28,657 --> 01:11:29,077
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you will.

999
01:11:54,736 --> 01:12:00,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1000
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:01,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

1001
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:02,720
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Nim.

1002
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:03,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Nim.

1003
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:04,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Nim.

1004
01:12:04,281 --> 01:12:04,961
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1005
01:12:06,742 --> 01:12:07,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Not much, really.

1006
01:12:07,382 --> 01:12:09,023
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't expect to get through.

1007
01:12:09,843 --> 01:12:10,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you did.

1008
01:12:10,584 --> 01:12:12,305
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have anything you want to share with us tonight?

1009
01:12:12,405 --> 01:12:13,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Why'd you call?

1010
01:12:14,426 --> 01:12:16,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.

1011
01:12:16,547 --> 01:12:18,868
[SPEAKER_11]: I was making a TV show.

1012
01:12:20,489 --> 01:12:21,510
[SPEAKER_11]: You were making what?

1013
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:22,550
[SPEAKER_13]: The computer.

1014
01:12:23,871 --> 01:12:24,572
[SPEAKER_13]: You were making what?

1015
01:12:24,872 --> 01:12:25,532
[SPEAKER_13]: A new game.

1016
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:30,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you're the one that messaged Loki earlier and said you're making this game called Kibi.

1017
01:12:31,856 --> 01:12:32,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1018
01:12:32,317 --> 01:12:33,137
[SPEAKER_13]: What is this all about?

1019
01:12:34,398 --> 01:12:39,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, it's going to run off of a modified version of Step Mania.

1020
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:45,906
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of the real army is going to help us with it.

1021
01:12:47,387 --> 01:12:47,767
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um,

1022
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:49,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's pretty much all we're doing.

1023
01:12:49,343 --> 01:12:50,684
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for artists and such.

1024
01:12:51,624 --> 01:12:53,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you made a post in our forums about it?

1025
01:12:54,765 --> 01:12:55,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, no.

1026
01:12:55,806 --> 01:12:57,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now it's pretty much underground.

1027
01:12:58,347 --> 01:13:03,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, now you just outed it to all the folks that listen to the program, so go post on the forums.

1028
01:13:03,549 --> 01:13:04,369
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure you can get some help.

1029
01:13:04,749 --> 01:13:05,709
[SPEAKER_13]: And good luck to you on the project.

1030
01:13:05,749 --> 01:13:06,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1031
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:07,830
[SPEAKER_13]: So what is it?

1032
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:12,812
[SPEAKER_13]: It's supposed to be a Beatmania-ish game, but with DDR's interface, or...?

1033
01:13:15,339 --> 01:13:16,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Turn down your radio.

1034
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on a second.

1035
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

1036
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:19,961
[SPEAKER_13]: See, I can hear myself in the background.

1037
01:13:20,341 --> 01:13:21,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Turn down the radio.

1038
01:13:22,202 --> 01:13:23,623
[SPEAKER_13]: When you call radio programs, turn down the radio.

1039
01:13:23,643 --> 01:13:25,143
[SPEAKER_08]: We should have you sing death metal for us, Rob.

1040
01:13:26,264 --> 01:13:27,184
[SPEAKER_13]: That's because I love GWAR.

1041
01:13:27,204 --> 01:13:27,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn headphones.

1042
01:13:27,844 --> 01:13:28,485
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, no, that's right.

1043
01:13:28,765 --> 01:13:31,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so, anyway, what was I going to say?

1044
01:13:33,027 --> 01:13:36,928
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is what, DDR, it's based on a DDR interface, but it's Beatmania.

1045
01:13:38,269 --> 01:13:40,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like, have you seen the videos of...

1046
01:13:41,438 --> 01:13:42,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Step Mania.

1047
01:13:42,579 --> 01:13:49,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I always thought Step... Like, 99% of people who play Step Mania are just doing Finger Finger Revolution.

1048
01:13:49,945 --> 01:13:52,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Very few people are actually hooking up dance pads to the computer.

1049
01:13:52,927 --> 01:13:54,549
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I think it's a good idea.

1050
01:13:54,649 --> 01:13:57,991
[SPEAKER_13]: At least make something that's actually not pretending to be actual dancing.

1051
01:13:59,312 --> 01:13:59,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I know.

1052
01:13:59,713 --> 01:14:00,213
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the point.

1053
01:14:00,814 --> 01:14:01,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Great!

1054
01:14:01,314 --> 01:14:02,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Then I fully support this project.

1055
01:14:03,936 --> 01:14:04,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1056
01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:05,638
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll draw you a picture.

1057
01:14:06,018 --> 01:14:06,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Good luck to you.

1058
01:14:06,999 --> 01:14:08,540
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll do announcer packs if you need it.

1059
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:15,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, thanks guys Alright, no problem, good luck with your project and keep us informed on the forums or whatever, alright?

1060
01:14:18,282 --> 01:14:32,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, oh, I guess he hung up If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, let's go to the phones Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1061
01:14:33,809 --> 01:14:37,030
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Paradox Vincent Hi Paradox Vincent, what's on your mind, buddy?

1062
01:14:39,338 --> 01:14:53,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was picking my friend up a game at GameStop recently, and they had Game Informer at display, so I picked it up and I flipped through the reviews, and I saw they gave Wii Sports a 6.5 out of 5.

1063
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:59,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, they gave Wii Sports 6.5 out of 5?

1064
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:01,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1065
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:03,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that a typo or something?

1066
01:15:05,202 --> 01:15:05,403
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1067
01:15:05,943 --> 01:15:06,943
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you give a game a 6.5 out of 5?

1068
01:15:09,933 --> 01:15:11,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do I think they gave it one?

1069
01:15:13,777 --> 01:15:17,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they gave it one because it's not like Gears of War.

1070
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:25,127
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not this hyper-polished first-person shooter that takes years upon years to make.

1071
01:15:25,207 --> 01:15:27,129
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a simple little sports game.

1072
01:15:27,149 --> 01:15:28,450
[SPEAKER_04]: You meant to say 6.5 out of 10, right?

1073
01:15:31,713 --> 01:15:35,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but the thing is that every single person that I've showed this game to, they've absolutely loved it.

1074
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:36,396
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had a... She was an older woman...

1075
01:16:02,946 --> 01:16:08,708
[SPEAKER_04]: A middle-aged woman comes up to my mom and says, Hey, have you checked out Wii Bowling?

1076
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:24,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And for someone of that age to come up to another woman of similar age and discuss a video game with them, I think Nintendo's done exactly what they wanted to do in the first place.

1077
01:16:24,915 --> 01:16:28,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's like you're living in Bizarro World for a minute when your parents are the ones talking about Nintendo.

1078
01:16:29,096 --> 01:16:30,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me quote the review real quick.

1079
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:33,259
[SPEAKER_12]: Their basic breakdown of this.

1080
01:16:33,379 --> 01:16:38,500
[SPEAKER_12]: It says the concept is an uneven intro into the system and its controllers, but at least it's free.

1081
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:43,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Graphics, they say the game uses Mii avatars on your Wii, but that's about the only eye-catching thing about it.

1082
01:16:44,201 --> 01:16:48,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Sound, the tiny sound that comes from the Wii remote really starting to bug me.

1083
01:16:48,802 --> 01:16:53,883
[SPEAKER_12]: It says playability, sometimes there are inconsistencies between your movement and what happens on screen.

1084
01:16:54,164 --> 01:16:58,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Entertainment, this is a shallow game by design, but it does offer some occasional fun.

1085
01:16:58,645 --> 01:17:00,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Replay, moderately low.

1086
01:17:00,512 --> 01:17:02,373
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1087
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:22,137
[SPEAKER_13]: and many more.

1088
01:17:46,512 --> 01:17:57,859
[SPEAKER_13]: You remember back in the day if you ever let a non-gamer, or even some regular gamers, would play an old 8-bit game, they'd move their body with the controller, and when they jump, you'll pull back and all that stuff?

1089
01:17:57,939 --> 01:17:59,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo made that a part of the game.

1090
01:18:01,707 --> 01:18:04,908
[SPEAKER_13]: and when they said they were going new generation, they meant it.

1091
01:18:05,288 --> 01:18:11,030
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why I think a lot of people that have been in this line of thinking for a while are going to be in for a rude awakening pretty soon.

1092
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:14,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo is not making games necessarily for the hardcore gamer.

1093
01:18:14,812 --> 01:18:23,094
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know what, I urge you guys out there who read a lot of these reviews, and it's not just this particular one, but think about all these stories we've had lately.

1094
01:18:23,134 --> 01:18:27,576
[SPEAKER_13]: We had EGM bash Elebits when it didn't really, you know, a lot of folks feel it didn't need it.

1095
01:18:27,876 --> 01:18:33,788
[SPEAKER_13]: We had GameSpot, heaven forbid, didn't give Zelda a 9 or a 10 and they received the wrath of Nintendo fanboys everywhere.

1096
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:40,212
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it is very interesting that the common theme here is all Nintendo Wii games.

1097
01:18:40,652 --> 01:18:43,913
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing, too, is people need to understand these are critics.

1098
01:18:44,173 --> 01:18:45,814
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't necessarily... Exactly.

1099
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:49,835
[SPEAKER_12]: And here's a website I recommend checking out, Metacritic.com.

1100
01:18:50,196 --> 01:18:53,217
[SPEAKER_12]: It's M-E-T-A-C-R-I-T-C.

1101
01:18:53,837 --> 01:19:01,860
[SPEAKER_12]: And definitely check it out because they break down, they have a list of all the scores at different magazines and websites and whatnot I've published, except

1102
01:19:02,253 --> 01:19:05,334
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have anything on here.

1103
01:19:05,394 --> 01:19:07,615
[SPEAKER_12]: But it does give an average and also has user averages.

1104
01:19:07,695 --> 01:19:12,017
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's a really good place to look, especially if you're wondering if a game is good or not.

1105
01:19:12,237 --> 01:19:16,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't read one magazine or a couple magazines because certain people have certain tastes in magazines.

1106
01:19:16,478 --> 01:19:20,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, for example, if I were rating a sports game, I'd probably give it a low score because I hate sports games.

1107
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,100
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's not fair.

1108
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:24,841
[SPEAKER_12]: But unfortunately, there are biased reviews out there.

1109
01:19:24,921 --> 01:19:29,703
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why you need websites like this or just the kind of...

1110
01:19:30,205 --> 01:19:30,725
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

1111
01:19:52,797 --> 01:20:01,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, then go out and find another one of the hundreds of video game podcasts that are out there being produced by independent gamers like you and me that have similar tastes.

1112
01:20:01,643 --> 01:20:07,867
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that is where things are headed, and that's why I say that the traditional gaming press is in for a rude awakening very soon.

1113
01:20:09,969 --> 01:20:11,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1114
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:13,811
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been dominating the conversation.

1115
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:14,331
[SPEAKER_13]: I apologize.

1116
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:15,052
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think, buddy?

1117
01:20:17,073 --> 01:20:18,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I agree with you.

1118
01:20:18,794 --> 01:20:22,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that if they are in for a rude awakening,

1119
01:20:23,081 --> 01:20:32,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really welcoming that because up until now, gaming has been viewed as a very nerd culture thing.

1120
01:20:32,988 --> 01:20:38,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that just being able to interact with something that's on TV isn't evil.

1121
01:20:38,512 --> 01:20:40,114
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not obscure.

1122
01:20:40,274 --> 01:20:43,096
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty natural for me.

1123
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:50,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that if somebody can just sit down and have fun with a game, then

1124
01:20:51,204 --> 01:20:59,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that's exactly what Nintendo wants them to do and that's exactly what I think they are going to and I'm hoping they're going to achieve.

1125
01:21:00,429 --> 01:21:09,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Out of curiosity, outside of Nintendo Power, can anyone, whether on the phone or here in the room, think of, is there a magazine out there geared towards the casual gamer?

1126
01:21:10,414 --> 01:21:10,514
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1127
01:21:11,652 --> 01:21:14,614
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not necessarily saying that Nintendo Power is like that magazine, but you know what I mean?

1128
01:21:14,634 --> 01:21:21,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Like something that would maybe give the Wii game reviews the perspective that the big boys are missing out on?

1129
01:21:22,258 --> 01:21:23,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any type of publication like that right now?

1130
01:21:24,499 --> 01:21:25,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that I know of.

1131
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:26,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe there ought to be.

1132
01:21:26,461 --> 01:21:29,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Not specifically to gaming.

1133
01:21:29,222 --> 01:21:29,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe, I don't know.

1134
01:21:29,722 --> 01:21:33,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe they figure that because they're casual gamers, they wouldn't want to buy magazines about gaming.

1135
01:21:33,044 --> 01:21:33,344
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1136
01:21:33,805 --> 01:21:34,385
[SPEAKER_13]: But just kind of.

1137
01:21:34,738 --> 01:21:37,779
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, but for a casual gamer, just like he said, Grandma's talking to Grandma about Wii Bowling.

1138
01:22:05,555 --> 01:22:13,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but see, then these people are also going to say, oh, the Wii's the best system in the fucking world because you swing around in the game and it's more interactive.

1139
01:22:13,682 --> 01:22:16,124
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a really, you know, informed decision.

1140
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:19,006
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just, you know, I see something different.

1141
01:22:19,947 --> 01:22:20,787
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, shiny.

1142
01:22:20,847 --> 01:22:22,549
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's... I don't know.

1143
01:22:22,869 --> 01:22:25,251
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just kind of on the other end of the spectrum.

1144
01:22:25,311 --> 01:22:34,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Instead of having someone that's really hardcore into a game, you have someone reviewing a game that knows jack shit about games and they're reviewing it just, you know, because...

1145
01:22:34,915 --> 01:22:36,295
[SPEAKER_12]: Nintendo Total, it's an awesome game.

1146
01:22:36,436 --> 01:22:37,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it's an awesome game.

1147
01:22:38,096 --> 01:22:39,036
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know.

1148
01:22:40,037 --> 01:22:40,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1149
01:22:40,917 --> 01:22:42,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, any other thoughts you want to share with our listeners?

1150
01:22:43,118 --> 01:22:43,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Paradox Vincent?

1151
01:22:45,038 --> 01:22:46,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Shadow Center is amazing.

1152
01:22:46,899 --> 01:22:47,819
[SPEAKER_13]: It is great.

1153
01:22:47,879 --> 01:22:48,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Horribly underlooked.

1154
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,961
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you own a Wii, you owe it to yourself to at least rent this damn game and check it out.

1155
01:22:54,617 --> 01:23:18,413
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's pretty I'm spoiled by the 360's graphics and what little I've seen of the Playstation 3 The graphics in Trauma Center, not that thrilling, but that's not the point That's not the point of Trauma Center Oh yeah I'm not surprised, once again I'm sure the mainstream gaming press kind of missed that But the game is more fun than a lot of games I've played in a long time

1156
01:23:18,894 --> 01:23:21,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, we've got to let you go, Paradox Vincent, so we can take other calls.

1157
01:23:21,155 --> 01:23:25,016
[SPEAKER_13]: But thanks so much for inspiring the lively chat we've had here.

1158
01:23:26,356 --> 01:23:27,176
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1159
01:23:27,396 --> 01:23:27,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care, buddy.

1160
01:23:29,157 --> 01:23:29,497
[SPEAKER_13]: You too.

1161
01:23:29,657 --> 01:23:30,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye-bye.

1162
01:23:31,217 --> 01:23:33,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go to another phone call, shall we?

1163
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:36,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go to this call.

1164
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:37,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1165
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:38,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

1166
01:23:38,999 --> 01:23:40,000
[SPEAKER_03]: This is DMN.

1167
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:40,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, boy.

1168
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:42,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

1169
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,441
[SPEAKER_13]: You always manage to get through.

1170
01:23:45,581 --> 01:23:46,982
[SPEAKER_13]: When are you coming to visit me again?

1171
01:23:48,002 --> 01:23:48,202
[SPEAKER_13]: May.

1172
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:49,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1173
01:23:49,297 --> 01:23:50,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they're planning something.

1174
01:23:50,918 --> 01:24:01,966
[SPEAKER_13]: The rest of OLR's contributors are planning something big for the fifth anniversary of OLR, which, by the way, I forgot to say this at the top of the show, but this episode would mark our third year of podcasting or our third birthday.

1175
01:24:02,046 --> 01:24:02,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

1176
01:24:02,586 --> 01:24:03,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

1177
01:24:03,547 --> 01:24:03,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.

1178
01:24:03,967 --> 01:24:04,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

1179
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,270
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we were forced to eat Rob's shoes.

1180
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:09,972
[SPEAKER_13]: You can only celebrate so many landmark shows.

1181
01:24:10,012 --> 01:24:10,792
[SPEAKER_13]: So anyway, whatever.

1182
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:12,013
[SPEAKER_13]: DMM, what's on your mind tonight?

1183
01:24:12,642 --> 01:24:13,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Two things.

1184
01:24:13,503 --> 01:24:16,484
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one, but that previous call fired up some other things.

1185
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:19,026
[SPEAKER_03]: One, I'm disappointed in the three of you.

1186
01:24:19,966 --> 01:24:20,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1187
01:24:20,407 --> 01:24:22,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't do it!

1188
01:24:22,848 --> 01:24:23,468
[SPEAKER_03]: You did, Jamie.

1189
01:24:23,489 --> 01:24:23,669
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

1190
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:27,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not hear Okami out of any one of you three.

1191
01:24:27,415 --> 01:24:28,415
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't play Okami!

1192
01:24:29,416 --> 01:24:30,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting, huh?

1193
01:24:31,077 --> 01:24:40,423
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's because PS2 games, late generation PS2 games are being horribly overlooked in this, you know, last push towards the next gen of gaming.

1194
01:24:40,463 --> 01:24:42,024
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, I guess I'm a little bit guilty of that.

1195
01:24:42,404 --> 01:24:48,988
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, it's kind of one of those cases where if I had more, if I had a top 20 or a top 15, probably Okami would have made it.

1196
01:24:50,389 --> 01:24:53,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Or even it could have been my number 10, but I had to say Sneak King, I had to.

1197
01:24:54,560 --> 01:25:00,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, but, I mean, for one, Okami was my game of the year, if anybody listened to SDFU, all three of you.

1198
01:25:00,941 --> 01:25:01,721
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we don't listen to it.

1199
01:25:02,242 --> 01:25:04,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Okami was my game of the year.

1200
01:25:06,262 --> 01:25:08,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was surprised that none of you guys said it.

1201
01:25:09,823 --> 01:25:11,303
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1202
01:25:11,363 --> 01:25:15,824
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's probably 500 other people out there listening going, why didn't they rank this game higher?

1203
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:17,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Why didn't they put this game on the list?

1204
01:25:17,525 --> 01:25:18,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not this?

1205
01:25:18,205 --> 01:25:18,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not that?

1206
01:25:19,045 --> 01:25:19,505
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1207
01:25:19,565 --> 01:25:23,666
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the whole point of top lists, is it's just one opinion and take it or leave it.

1208
01:25:25,244 --> 01:25:27,145
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not saying Okami's a bad game by any means.

1209
01:25:27,225 --> 01:25:29,125
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fantastic, but, you know.

1210
01:25:29,205 --> 01:25:31,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, good, because if you said it's a bad game, I'd punch you in the face.

1211
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:32,507
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, I don't feel that way at all.

1212
01:25:32,787 --> 01:25:35,327
[SPEAKER_08]: That means you'd have to come here to do it, and then I'd have to catch it on film.

1213
01:25:35,408 --> 01:25:36,508
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't... Exactly.

1214
01:25:36,688 --> 01:25:40,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not... Well, I left Gears of War off my top 10, and Gears of War wouldn't even be in my top 20.

1215
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:42,550
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's just me personally.

1216
01:25:42,630 --> 01:25:44,751
[SPEAKER_13]: I was severely disappointed by Gears of War.

1217
01:25:45,211 --> 01:25:50,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Go back and listen to me supporting Michelle from Video Game Outsiders in last week's episode.

1218
01:25:50,112 --> 01:25:51,113
[SPEAKER_13]: She felt the same way I did.

1219
01:25:51,133 --> 01:25:51,373
[SPEAKER_13]: It just...

1220
01:25:52,493 --> 01:25:53,774
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't all that.

1221
01:25:54,074 --> 01:25:55,235
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty and that's it.

1222
01:25:56,095 --> 01:25:56,435
[SPEAKER_13]: To me.

1223
01:25:57,096 --> 01:25:57,596
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway.

1224
01:25:59,117 --> 01:26:04,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two is Nintendo Power for about the past year hasn't really been catered toward the casual gamer.

1225
01:26:04,579 --> 01:26:06,560
[SPEAKER_03]: They've changed their outlook on things.

1226
01:26:07,821 --> 01:26:10,623
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't trying to say Nintendo Power was a casual gamer's magazine.

1227
01:26:10,683 --> 01:26:18,647
[SPEAKER_13]: I was trying to think like what magazine is reviewing Wii games from the perspective of I am not a hardcore gamer.

1228
01:26:18,787 --> 01:26:21,208
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm someone who just likes to have fun.

1229
01:26:22,513 --> 01:26:24,334
[SPEAKER_13]: What gaming magazine could Nelly read?

1230
01:26:24,975 --> 01:26:25,595
[SPEAKER_13]: None of them.

1231
01:26:25,935 --> 01:26:26,296
[SPEAKER_03]: None of them.

1232
01:26:26,836 --> 01:26:27,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you why.

1233
01:26:27,756 --> 01:26:29,598
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, you see shitty games.

1234
01:26:29,778 --> 01:26:32,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I could bring up a big example several years back.

1235
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:35,201
[SPEAKER_03]: A game for the PS2 called State of Emergency.

1236
01:26:35,962 --> 01:26:37,042
[SPEAKER_03]: This game was hyped as hell.

1237
01:26:39,464 --> 01:26:42,986
[SPEAKER_03]: This is when I knew one of my favorite magazines, Jump the Shark, EGM.

1238
01:26:43,026 --> 01:26:47,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe they gave the game an 8.5.

1239
01:26:47,789 --> 01:26:49,710
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the worst games I've ever played.

1240
01:26:50,447 --> 01:27:03,038
[SPEAKER_03]: It started making me think that I think some of those developers pay off magazines to give their games good reviews, and if that is the case, I'm very sorely disappointed in gaming media.

1241
01:27:03,178 --> 01:27:05,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at Atari and Driver 3, that's what they did.

1242
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:08,423
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to go there because I don't have the proof to back it up, but...

1243
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:15,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Gaming fans are very... I mean, it's a very interesting industry.

1244
01:27:15,391 --> 01:27:20,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, you know, you take the passion that movie fans have about movies.

1245
01:27:20,613 --> 01:27:23,514
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, go to those big movie websites like, you know, Ain't It Cool News or whatever.

1246
01:27:23,534 --> 01:27:25,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Just read the passion that people have for movies.

1247
01:27:26,054 --> 01:27:29,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Multiply that by 100 and you have the gaming fans and the games.

1248
01:27:30,196 --> 01:27:32,656
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it's something else.

1249
01:27:32,916 --> 01:27:37,498
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, and the gaming fans will respond appropriately, I think.

1250
01:27:37,578 --> 01:27:39,118
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think gaming fans are stupid.

1251
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:43,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at what happened with All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com.

1252
01:27:44,063 --> 01:27:44,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Case in point.

1253
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:46,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1254
01:27:47,343 --> 01:27:50,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could also put the Halo franchise in that same limelight.

1255
01:27:51,044 --> 01:27:58,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that they're 10 out of 10s as what a lot of magazines gave Halo 1 and some gave Halo 2 when it came out.

1256
01:27:59,305 --> 01:28:03,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're decent, but they're not like, you know, industry-changing games.

1257
01:28:04,806 --> 01:28:06,287
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's funny with that, I would actually disagree.

1258
01:28:06,327 --> 01:28:08,667
[SPEAKER_13]: I do think Halo 2 is a 10 out of 10 game, but that's just me.

1259
01:28:08,687 --> 01:28:08,987
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean,

1260
01:28:10,234 --> 01:28:13,696
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do think it's an industry-changing game, but that's, you know, again, it's opinion.

1261
01:28:15,017 --> 01:28:16,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1262
01:28:17,398 --> 01:28:18,199
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's about it.

1263
01:28:19,059 --> 01:28:19,359
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1264
01:28:19,559 --> 01:28:23,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, DMN, so you're going to have the guy from VG Cats on your show on Thursday, we hope?

1265
01:28:24,322 --> 01:28:25,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Either this or next week.

1266
01:28:25,343 --> 01:28:26,123
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're shooting for.

1267
01:28:26,183 --> 01:28:27,744
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you landing all these big interviews?

1268
01:28:28,024 --> 01:28:30,986
[SPEAKER_13]: You just smoozing, writing nice emails and all that stuff?

1269
01:28:31,526 --> 01:28:35,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I... How much dick are you having to suck, I guess is what I'm asking.

1270
01:28:36,369 --> 01:28:37,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you taught me, so...

1271
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:46,392
[SPEAKER_13]: I must have taught you better than myself because we're not landing any of these big interviews, but you are.

1272
01:28:46,412 --> 01:28:47,712
[SPEAKER_13]: So no, that's cool.

1273
01:28:47,752 --> 01:28:48,632
[SPEAKER_13]: We love VG Cats.

1274
01:28:48,692 --> 01:28:49,652
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking forward to hearing that.

1275
01:28:49,672 --> 01:28:52,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell them that they're my favorite webcomic ever.

1276
01:28:52,253 --> 01:28:55,314
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure he's going to take the time to point that out.

1277
01:28:55,854 --> 01:28:57,314
[SPEAKER_13]: The chick on OLR loves you.

1278
01:29:02,395 --> 01:29:03,776
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, DMN, have a good time.

1279
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:05,596
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to try to get another call before we leave.

1280
01:29:05,616 --> 01:29:06,476
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, have a good one.

1281
01:29:06,536 --> 01:29:07,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, guys.

1282
01:29:07,277 --> 01:29:07,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

1283
01:29:07,517 --> 01:29:07,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

1284
01:29:11,069 --> 01:29:16,631
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or the Skype line is Orange Lounge Radio.

1285
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:20,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's try at least one more call here, maybe more if we're feeling saucy.

1286
01:29:21,613 --> 01:29:23,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1287
01:29:23,053 --> 01:29:23,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

1288
01:29:24,694 --> 01:29:25,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Raven's Dolphin.

1289
01:29:25,574 --> 01:29:26,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Raven's Dolphin.

1290
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:27,055
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1291
01:29:28,335 --> 01:29:32,717
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say that Microsoft did not give early adopters the shaft.

1292
01:29:34,297 --> 01:29:35,638
[SPEAKER_13]: They did not give who the shaft?

1293
01:29:36,698 --> 01:29:37,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Early adopters.

1294
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:37,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, early adopters.

1295
01:29:37,719 --> 01:29:38,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Early adopters.

1296
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:38,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1297
01:29:38,759 --> 01:29:38,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1298
01:29:40,168 --> 01:29:44,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they did not introduce the HDMI port for the Xbox 360 XS.

1299
01:29:54,651 --> 01:29:55,452
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they didn't.

1300
01:29:55,812 --> 01:29:57,573
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't even say HDMI.

1301
01:29:57,873 --> 01:30:08,960
[SPEAKER_11]: They just went like, okay, this is the Xbox, this is IPTV, this is what you can do with it, this is Uno, now you can play Uno on the road, you can play Uno here, you can play Uno there, you can even play this there.

1302
01:30:09,061 --> 01:30:12,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, I'm saying it's super bullshit now.

1303
01:30:12,503 --> 01:30:13,684
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's coming later.

1304
01:30:17,654 --> 01:30:20,235
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm keeping my mind open to this.

1305
01:30:47,354 --> 01:30:51,135
[SPEAKER_11]: One more thing I want to tell you about that, that HDMI hookup in the back of the 360.

1306
01:30:51,595 --> 01:30:52,676
[SPEAKER_11]: It ran through VGA.

1307
01:30:52,696 --> 01:30:56,197
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll get up to VGA through the TV.

1308
01:30:56,297 --> 01:30:57,137
[SPEAKER_13]: True, true, they do.

1309
01:30:58,138 --> 01:30:59,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll see, we'll see.

1310
01:31:01,479 --> 01:31:08,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, and just want to say they didn't give you the shaft, and I am now trying to get money up for Windows Vista.

1311
01:31:10,101 --> 01:31:10,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, good luck.

1312
01:31:12,142 --> 01:31:13,462
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, you're right.

1313
01:31:14,543 --> 01:31:15,503
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, take care, buddy.

1314
01:31:16,598 --> 01:31:17,118
[SPEAKER_13]: You too, bye.

1315
01:31:42,918 --> 01:31:48,344
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't heard you guys talk too much about portables, like DS games, except like Cooking Mama.

1316
01:31:49,765 --> 01:31:50,466
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be me.

1317
01:31:50,986 --> 01:31:51,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah?

1318
01:31:51,927 --> 01:31:53,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my favorite game too, by the way.

1319
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:56,532
[SPEAKER_13]: So what were you hoping that we would be talking about?

1320
01:31:57,333 --> 01:32:05,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it's like, because I just started hearing you guys in November, and one of the games I wasn't sure you guys talked about was in the Castlevania series.

1321
01:32:05,689 --> 01:32:15,781
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what's funny is that the last time I actually played the Castlevania game, I do still need to pick up the new one on DS, but we did get to play it in August at the little Konami thing we went to.

1322
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:20,327
[SPEAKER_13]: I really enjoyed it more than the previous DS game.

1323
01:32:20,507 --> 01:32:21,749
[SPEAKER_13]: I get all the names confused.

1324
01:32:21,769 --> 01:32:22,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Dawn of Sorrow, is that it?

1325
01:32:23,150 --> 01:32:23,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Dawn of Sorrow was the first one.

1326
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:26,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Dawn of Sorrow was the last one, and then this new one, Portrait of Ruin.

1327
01:32:26,231 --> 01:32:27,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Portrait of Ruin I liked quite a bit.

1328
01:32:27,831 --> 01:32:33,713
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked the whole fact that you had kind of the two characters, and I liked the fact that you kind of went outside the castle into other worlds.

1329
01:32:33,773 --> 01:32:37,855
[SPEAKER_13]: It felt a little more like Simon's Quest, I suppose, in that regard.

1330
01:32:37,935 --> 01:32:40,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Or Mario 64, where you jump into the paintings.

1331
01:32:40,795 --> 01:32:42,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, kind of like that, yeah.

1332
01:32:42,716 --> 01:32:44,236
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, no, it was pretty cool.

1333
01:32:44,276 --> 01:32:49,038
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to check out the final release of the game, although I'm pretty sure what we played in August was pretty close to final, so...

1334
01:32:49,915 --> 01:32:51,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've been playing for a while.

1335
01:32:51,817 --> 01:32:52,958
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really good.

1336
01:32:54,099 --> 01:33:00,986
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never seen a bad... What was the other game we played that Kojima was behind on the DS?

1337
01:33:01,046 --> 01:33:02,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that hasn't come out yet.

1338
01:33:02,107 --> 01:33:03,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember the name of it.

1339
01:33:03,268 --> 01:33:04,009
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1340
01:33:04,489 --> 01:33:04,850
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn it.

1341
01:33:06,311 --> 01:33:06,892
[SPEAKER_12]: Lunar Knights.

1342
01:33:07,012 --> 01:33:07,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Lunar Knights, thank you.

1343
01:33:08,173 --> 01:33:08,894
[SPEAKER_12]: That was pretty decent.

1344
01:33:08,954 --> 01:33:09,294
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked that.

1345
01:33:10,054 --> 01:33:10,614
[SPEAKER_13]: LUNAR NIGHTS

1346
01:33:25,126 --> 01:33:26,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins

1347
01:33:53,496 --> 01:33:57,258
[SPEAKER_13]: The Gradius Collection and those other retro titles are great.

1348
01:33:57,458 --> 01:33:59,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Every Extended Extra is pretty good.

1349
01:33:59,059 --> 01:34:02,481
[SPEAKER_12]: Twin V Collection, which is coming out, and the Salamander Collection.

1350
01:34:02,581 --> 01:34:04,302
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Salamander Hall.

1351
01:34:04,642 --> 01:34:10,946
[SPEAKER_12]: And, of course, for Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy VI, first week in February there.

1352
01:34:10,966 --> 01:34:13,527
[SPEAKER_12]: Diddy Kong Racing for the DS.

1353
01:34:14,067 --> 01:34:15,048
[SPEAKER_13]: We love our handhelds.

1354
01:34:15,128 --> 01:34:17,689
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just the past couple months have been mostly the systems for me.

1355
01:34:18,170 --> 01:34:19,010
[SPEAKER_13]: The consoles, I should say.

1356
01:34:19,844 --> 01:34:25,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just, hmm, Warriors on PSP, I hope it plays like the Xbox and PS2 versions.

1357
01:34:26,772 --> 01:34:27,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we'll see.

1358
01:34:28,054 --> 01:34:31,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I hope so, because I tried Luminous, like you said, and on the phone, actually.

1359
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:33,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, what'd you think?

1360
01:34:34,848 --> 01:34:38,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't really hear the music, but the gameplay was actually addicting.

1361
01:34:55,257 --> 01:35:23,187
[SPEAKER_13]: especially when you consider the mobile really took some risks with the gameplay I felt that Luminous 2 was a little too much more of the same for it to be justified on the top 10 of the year but it definitely was a very solid release and if you have not played Luminous at all then it's okay to skip Luminous 1 and go right to 2 because it does have some added things and I think the additional skins and the music videos were very cool oh that was the other reason why Luminous 2 lost a lot of brownie points with me is because they recycled way too much for Luminous 1

1362
01:35:24,144 --> 01:35:53,361
[SPEAKER_13]: so pretty much pretty much Luminous 2 is like Luminous 1 plus other stuff then yeah but like way more stuff and if you don't have a PSP at all you should get the Xbox Live one but I don't think you need both unless you're really a puzzle game whore like I am well not as much for me but the 360 I'll get later I'm eagerly hoping that the music artist pack and the Heavenly Star song is out very very soon it was supposed to be in January at some point so we'll see hmm

1363
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:58,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it'll be a while for me to get it because of money and all that.

1364
01:35:58,984 --> 01:35:59,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1365
01:36:00,084 --> 01:36:01,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other thoughts for our listeners?

1366
01:36:01,525 --> 01:36:02,366
[SPEAKER_13]: DDR dollar bill?

1367
01:36:04,327 --> 01:36:10,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a few, but I'm just still a little sick right now, so I just wanted to chime in about the portables because I never hear you guys talk about it.

1368
01:36:10,972 --> 01:36:13,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we try to give it a little love once in a while.

1369
01:36:13,093 --> 01:36:13,894
[SPEAKER_13]: We do love our portables.

1370
01:36:13,954 --> 01:36:16,515
[SPEAKER_13]: I love my DS and my PSP for certain things.

1371
01:36:17,376 --> 01:36:17,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Same here.

1372
01:36:18,217 --> 01:36:18,517
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1373
01:36:19,217 --> 01:36:20,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thanks so much for the call, buddy.

1374
01:36:20,438 --> 01:36:20,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep listening.

1375
01:36:20,878 --> 01:36:22,379
[SPEAKER_09]: See you guys.

1376
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:22,860
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1377
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:23,080
[SPEAKER_13]: See you.

1378
01:36:23,866 --> 01:36:24,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye-bye.

1379
01:36:24,607 --> 01:36:24,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye-bye.

1380
01:36:26,428 --> 01:36:27,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Those were some good calls tonight.

1381
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:31,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Little rough starts to some of them, but we got our way through them.

1382
01:36:31,292 --> 01:36:33,033
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you guys so much for calling in tonight.

1383
01:36:33,053 --> 01:36:34,554
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to go ahead and close the Skype line.

1384
01:36:34,594 --> 01:36:37,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry to those that didn't get through, but we still love you.

1385
01:36:37,477 --> 01:36:38,117
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just we're running.

1386
01:36:38,137 --> 01:36:40,739
[SPEAKER_13]: We're almost to two hours for this segment, so we've got to wrap this crap up.

1387
01:36:40,919 --> 01:36:42,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Any last-minute stories, you guys?

1388
01:36:42,301 --> 01:36:42,521
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1389
01:36:42,781 --> 01:36:42,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1390
01:36:43,501 --> 01:36:49,286
[SPEAKER_12]: Necronasia is coming to the United States as a game called Escape from Bug Island.

1391
01:36:49,975 --> 01:36:50,695
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me tell you this much.

1392
01:36:50,735 --> 01:36:55,197
[SPEAKER_12]: The game is as crappy as that new title, so don't pick it up when it comes out.

1393
01:36:55,297 --> 01:36:56,218
[SPEAKER_12]: It's shit.

1394
01:36:57,058 --> 01:37:01,520
[SPEAKER_12]: But Eidos is producing it, so that won't be the first time that their games suck.

1395
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:02,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see here.

1396
01:37:02,681 --> 01:37:14,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Then, of course, there was some news also coming from CES about Vista, and this isn't really a huge surprise, that the Xbox 360 controller is going to be able to be used with Vista.

1397
01:37:14,586 --> 01:37:17,067
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, it's going to be kind of like a standard for them, so...

1398
01:37:19,137 --> 01:37:20,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Big, huge surprise there.

1399
01:37:20,858 --> 01:37:36,884
[SPEAKER_12]: What is kind of cool, though, is this Thursday, January 11th, there's going to be new content for Gears of War coming out, including two free maps, Raven Down, which is going to be a map set around a downed Raven helicopter, and it looks pretty.

1400
01:37:37,644 --> 01:37:45,267
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's also a new map called Old Bones, which looks like a museum, which looks pretty cool.

1401
01:37:45,714 --> 01:37:51,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Both of those are going to be free because they're being sponsored by, and this is weird, the Discovery Channel.

1402
01:37:51,819 --> 01:37:54,461
[SPEAKER_12]: They're also giving away 2 million Microsoft points.

1403
01:37:55,161 --> 01:37:58,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Doesn't Discovery HD, though, have a game special that's been airing or something?

1404
01:37:59,204 --> 01:37:59,524
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1405
01:37:59,564 --> 01:37:59,965
[SPEAKER_13]: I think so.

1406
01:38:00,685 --> 01:38:01,546
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes a little sense to me.

1407
01:38:01,926 --> 01:38:04,148
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of cool, I guess.

1408
01:38:05,729 --> 01:38:06,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty cool.

1409
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:09,952
[SPEAKER_12]: And also there's a rumor that Nintendo is developing a wireless nunchuck.

1410
01:38:09,972 --> 01:38:10,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Already.

1411
01:38:10,573 --> 01:38:10,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Already.

1412
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:12,581
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, you have anything?

1413
01:38:12,601 --> 01:38:12,641
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1414
01:38:24,910 --> 01:38:27,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, then that brings our show to a close.

1415
01:38:27,954 --> 01:38:30,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks again so much for tuning in to and supporting Independent Radio, you guys.

1416
01:38:30,958 --> 01:38:33,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a reminder, we're not live next week.

1417
01:38:33,281 --> 01:38:43,594
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, live listeners, but we just have personal situations to be dealt with, and that would include I'm finally going to Disneyland with the girls, so we'll take lots of pictures and share that with you guys in the fan communities.

1418
01:38:44,054 --> 01:39:12,854
[SPEAKER_13]: and Loki has that other thing which I'm just now finding out about and I really wish I could go to that so please give those two my old Final Fantasy XI buddies give them my best and best wishes and all that stuff and we will still have a new audio blog or podcast whatever you want to call it there will still be a new show that way so apologies to live listeners I know you've had to deal with a break but we promise after this week we won't be having a break for a long time a long time so if you bear with us we'll be good

1419
01:39:13,674 --> 01:39:16,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys so much for your continued support of our program.

1420
01:39:16,176 --> 01:39:17,618
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys are awesome.

1421
01:39:17,958 --> 01:39:19,619
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1422
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:21,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, your final thought.

1423
01:39:22,461 --> 01:39:29,927
[SPEAKER_12]: My final thought is there's this laser pen advertisement on this one page here, and it's cool because it shoots a giant laser.

1424
01:39:30,408 --> 01:39:31,869
[SPEAKER_12]: I want a laser.

1425
01:39:32,429 --> 01:39:33,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Lasers are awesome.

1426
01:39:34,491 --> 01:39:35,152
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it's shiny.

1427
01:39:36,973 --> 01:39:38,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Dark Sakura, your final thought.

1428
01:39:39,326 --> 01:39:50,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I really, really, really, really, really am tired of drinking my own medicinal tea to make my throat work.

1429
01:39:50,308 --> 01:39:56,530
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I want, um, and I want to cook something, but not right now.

1430
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:57,750
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to cook for real.

1431
01:39:58,430 --> 01:39:59,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Bake me a pie.

1432
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:00,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bake shepherd's pie.

1433
01:40:01,451 --> 01:40:02,311
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make good shepherd's pie.

1434
01:40:03,186 --> 01:40:10,094
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought is that Legend of Zaku says this, yay, that means you OLR listeners must watch 24 next Sunday in the show's absence.

1435
01:40:10,674 --> 01:40:17,402
[SPEAKER_13]: I would actually support that because 24 is a show I need to get back into that's really good, and I'm going to TiVo it while we're gone.

1436
01:40:17,963 --> 01:40:19,945
[SPEAKER_08]: People should look for us at Disneyland if they're going to be there.

1437
01:40:20,445 --> 01:40:21,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, say hi.

1438
01:40:21,166 --> 01:40:21,887
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't miss us.

1439
01:40:22,875 --> 01:40:23,295
