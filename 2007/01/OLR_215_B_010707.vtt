Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.200
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 215 for this January 7th, 2007.

00:26.200 --> 00:30.200
And what's going on actually right now while we're doing tonight's program and taping here

00:30.200 --> 00:34.040
live on this Sunday night is that actually Microsoft is giving their keynote speech right

00:34.040 --> 00:35.040
now, right?

00:35.040 --> 00:37.520
Over for CES, because Consumer Electronics Show is going on?

00:37.520 --> 00:38.520
Ah, yes.

00:38.520 --> 00:41.720
What, Loki, you've got, you're going to start us off with part B, talking about what's going

00:41.720 --> 00:43.000
on at CES right now.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.360
Yeah, there's a couple big announcements made about, you know, during CES and the keynote

00:49.360 --> 00:50.360
speech here.

00:50.360 --> 00:55.600
Of course, as we mentioned earlier, their big announcement, of course, was partnership

00:55.600 --> 01:00.480
I guess with Microsoft TV, which is an IPTV service.

01:00.480 --> 01:06.400
And you're going to be able to watch TV, I guess streamed over the internet, as well

01:06.400 --> 01:11.240
as record TV while playing games, which is pretty cool.

01:11.240 --> 01:15.880
And no clue yet when exactly that's going to go into effect, but it's something that

01:15.880 --> 01:17.720
they're going to launch this year.

01:17.720 --> 01:23.800
It's going to have digital video recording capabilities for gaming, movie viewing, and

01:23.800 --> 01:26.600
even voice and video chat.

01:26.600 --> 01:32.160
It says, we really are going to need a big hard drive for that.

01:32.160 --> 01:38.760
It says live chat while watching television, so people can watch Lost or something.

01:38.760 --> 01:42.600
Oh my God, that's a bad idea.

01:42.600 --> 01:50.360
Playing over Xbox Live while recording TV live in the background.

01:50.360 --> 01:56.380
This isn't a huge surprise because I remember they were talking something with DirecTV before.

01:56.380 --> 01:59.000
So I don't know, that's kind of cool.

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
The other thing which is going on right now that they were talking about was, I believe

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Halo 2 for Vista.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.240
Hold on, I have to say this.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.960
Fire Bulma says, so you can stay in front of your television all day long.

02:12.960 --> 02:13.960
Hooray.

02:13.960 --> 02:14.960
Good point.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.360
I mean, this is just encouraging people to get fat and lazy.

02:18.360 --> 02:25.720
Okay, so with Windows Vista, you're going to be able to play people on the 360, playing

02:25.720 --> 02:31.560
Halo 2 as well, and I assume, I guess, the original Xbox since, you know, they can play

02:31.560 --> 02:40.160
against the 360 people, but that's not the only game that you can play anywhere, which

02:40.160 --> 02:43.720
just was announced a few seconds ago here.

02:43.720 --> 02:49.880
The one Live Anywhere game that's going to be able to be played on Vista, on the 360

02:49.880 --> 02:54.240
and everything else, but not only that, Uno.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.240
Uno Anywhere.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.720
Oh my gosh, wow, interesting.

02:57.720 --> 03:01.920
Really, you know, I always thought you could play Uno Anywhere anyways because it's cards,

03:01.920 --> 03:02.920
but that's just me.

03:02.920 --> 03:06.040
You can play the electronic version anywhere you go.

03:06.040 --> 03:09.000
Draw 4, bitch, everywhere, across multiple platforms.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
You know, I think this is interesting because it's not a big surprise, it doesn't seem like

03:12.000 --> 03:17.200
anything that would be too difficult to do, I mean, cross-platform gaming is not unheard

03:17.200 --> 03:22.280
of and even with 360, I mean, Final Fantasy XI, you play against PlayStation 2 and PC

03:22.280 --> 03:26.000
users on Final Fantasy XI, right, which is on the 360, so it's not like this is unheard

03:26.000 --> 03:30.160
of, it's just kind of, I don't think anybody thought that they would do this, I mean, it's

03:30.160 --> 03:34.960
not really anything anyone was expecting, it's really truly a kind of pleasant surprise,

03:34.960 --> 03:35.960
if you will.

03:35.960 --> 03:36.960
Yeah.

03:36.960 --> 03:37.960
Kind of interesting.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.960
But once and for all, they will be able to settle the debate.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.200
Is it easier to play with the keyboard and mouse or with the 360 controller?

03:45.200 --> 03:47.920
They'll be able to finally settle that debate.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.560
Great.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.960
Very cool.

03:50.960 --> 03:56.400
Yeah, the chat room seems to be agreeing over at chat.orangelaunusradio.com.

03:56.400 --> 04:00.440
You know, you can play Uno with anyone anytime you want, just buy a deck of cards.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.160
It's very easy.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.160
But then...

04:03.160 --> 04:04.160
I have an Uno deck.

04:04.160 --> 04:08.960
But you can't get the Cameo cards and the Project Gotham racing cards, you can't...

04:08.960 --> 04:09.960
So?

04:09.960 --> 04:16.200
But I believe you can get, in regular, traditional card form, you can get Pokemon cards and the

04:16.200 --> 04:19.320
Clear cards, so you can play Uno in the pool.

04:19.320 --> 04:23.280
And you know, you can play World of Warcraft cards, too, once those come out.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.440
Hooray, hooray.

04:25.440 --> 04:31.720
Alright, well, I guess that's all we have coming out of CES right now.

04:31.720 --> 04:36.720
There is one other thing, Sony seeing that they've hit their target amount of units shipped

04:36.720 --> 04:41.640
for the Playstation 3, which was 1 million by the end of the year, although memory serves

04:41.640 --> 04:47.160
me correctly, I believe that target was a lot higher, and then they lowered it down.

04:47.160 --> 04:51.540
And the other thing, too, is they've shipped 1 million units worldwide.

04:51.540 --> 04:53.040
Not sold, shipped.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.200
They'll sell it.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.560
They'll sell it.

04:55.560 --> 04:59.920
I know we're all seeing the big pictures of stacks and stacks of PS3s on block.

04:59.920 --> 05:00.920
They'll sell them.

05:00.920 --> 05:04.360
Their next target is 6 million by March this year, so...

05:04.360 --> 05:05.840
Now that's ambitious.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.740
Let's see.

05:07.740 --> 05:11.320
One thing I wanted to ask about, too, and you showed me this during the break while

05:11.320 --> 05:12.420
we were alive.

05:12.420 --> 05:15.960
You have this Impossible Mission ad, and I want...

05:15.960 --> 05:19.280
It's Impossible Mission on the Wii, like the old school Commodore 64 game?

05:19.280 --> 05:20.280
Yeah, yeah, it was one of the games.

05:20.280 --> 05:23.680
I remember hearing Epyx was coming back and was going to redo games, but what the hell

05:23.680 --> 05:24.680
is this?

05:24.680 --> 05:25.680
I want it.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.680
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, Logie.

05:26.680 --> 05:30.180
It's being released in the UK right now.

05:30.180 --> 05:33.260
That's System 3 is putting it out.

05:33.260 --> 05:38.720
And basically this is an ad sheet that they had on GoNintendo.com.

05:38.720 --> 05:47.220
And yeah, it's just Impossible Mission, it's 2D, and yeah, just looks like kind of a visually

05:47.220 --> 05:49.400
updated version of a possible mission.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.040
So they're only getting it in Britain and not here?

05:52.040 --> 05:53.040
So far.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.320
I mean, it might end up coming over here.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.000
Like the one game I want.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.580
They do this to us.

06:00.580 --> 06:03.800
Just say you folks over there don't get some love because there you go.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.660
Maybe you should import a Wii.

06:05.660 --> 06:06.660
I'm not going to import...

06:06.660 --> 06:07.660
Well, I can't.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.200
They're on the different TV standards over there.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.200
Component?

06:10.200 --> 06:11.200
I guess that's true.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.880
I'm not going to import a Wii just to play Impossible Mission, I'm sorry.

06:15.880 --> 06:20.160
I'll write Nastygrams to whatever company is System 3, I'll write Nastygrams to them

06:20.160 --> 06:21.720
until they put this out in the US.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.680
I'm sure it'll come out over here at some point.

06:23.680 --> 06:24.680
It better.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.600
At least it's a budget title if nothing else.

06:27.600 --> 06:35.120
Alright, well, why don't we start off with the news, Loki, you had some news about E3?

06:35.120 --> 06:36.120
Yes.

06:36.120 --> 06:40.560
E3 and all 50,000 expos that have replaced it.

06:40.560 --> 06:44.680
Well, the official one I guess, being done, well originally it was going to be the Game

06:44.680 --> 06:52.300
Pro Expo, is now being called the Entertainment For All Expo, or the E For All Expo.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.840
The E For All Expo sounds like a rave to me.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.840
But, anyways...

06:57.840 --> 07:01.040
E for everyone!

07:01.040 --> 07:03.600
I love games, they're so pretty!

07:03.600 --> 07:06.800
Can I have a hug?

07:06.800 --> 07:08.560
The Entertainment For All Expo...

07:08.560 --> 07:09.920
Jamie, cuddle!

07:09.920 --> 07:14.580
Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub...

07:14.580 --> 07:15.580
What?

07:15.580 --> 07:16.580
No.

07:16.580 --> 07:21.040
The Entertainment For All Expo as it suggests is open to the public if you have $100 because

07:21.040 --> 07:23.920
it's going to cost you $100 to get into it.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.720
Whoa, whoa, what?

07:25.720 --> 07:32.960
gonna cost what? $100 to get into the expo. I guess that's not too bad. I mean if E3

07:32.960 --> 07:38.060
wanted to charge you $100 to get in. Actually, from what I remember, any Schmoe could really

07:38.060 --> 07:42.920
get into E3 for what that $400 fee or whatever it is. You really didn't even have to have

07:42.920 --> 07:48.440
ties to the industry to get in that way. So, you know, this is I guess cheaper than that.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.880
Because I imagine this expo will still be letting in, you know, media and all that type

07:51.880 --> 07:58.080
of stuff for a different rate. Probably not the same $100. Maybe. Interesting. Interesting.

07:58.080 --> 08:04.560
We'll see. But yeah, it'll be interesting to see how it ends up, you know, going down.

08:04.560 --> 08:09.720
But it's gonna be this year, 18th through the 20th of October. And good point, we got

08:09.720 --> 08:14.520
several people starting with Black Boy saying, except it isn't E3. And, you know, I understand.

08:14.520 --> 08:20.300
But it's kind of, for all we know, all we got otherwise. So, and they say they're trying

08:20.300 --> 08:24.360
to fill the void. So, I realize it's gonna be a little different because it's gonna be

08:24.360 --> 08:28.440
targeted at the gamer as opposed to the industry. But it should be interesting nonetheless.

08:28.440 --> 08:32.440
Well, I should be able to still go to the E3, the actual E3.

08:32.440 --> 08:36.160
Well, yeah, that's true. Because it's not, you know, not going away. So, it'll be interesting

08:36.160 --> 08:37.160
to see what happens.

08:37.160 --> 08:43.200
Somebody's like, you know, don't fucking take me to E3, bitches. Mo, I need this. It's my

08:43.200 --> 08:45.480
high. Anyways.

08:45.480 --> 08:48.960
I need that E, man. I need to cuddle.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.960
I need the EQ, man.

08:51.960 --> 08:55.160
Speaking of PlayStation 3s, we were talking about a little bit earlier, the stacks and

08:55.160 --> 09:00.800
stacks. Japan, over there, they're starting to see more PlayStation 3s. There was a report

09:00.800 --> 09:05.580
that went into Kotaku.com earlier this week from a reader that said they went to the Bic

09:05.580 --> 09:11.160
Camera store in Shibuya yesterday to pick up stuff for his place. And basically what

09:11.160 --> 09:17.400
happens, there was some New Year's sales going on. And get this, is that when the guy walked

09:17.400 --> 09:23.800
by, there were about 16 of the 60 gig and 12 of the 20 gig systems, priced for about

09:23.800 --> 09:29.120
what translates to $520 and $430, respectively. You watch right past this big pallet full

09:29.120 --> 09:33.560
of PlayStation 3s, just waiting to be sold over in Japan.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.400
Very interesting. I mean, just a few months ago, we were talking about all that fear.

09:36.400 --> 09:41.280
But you know, I know it's easy to want to like jump on Sony and be all like, haha, Sony's

09:41.280 --> 09:44.440
not selling systems, blah, blah, blah. But you kind of have to think about, too, Christmas

09:44.440 --> 09:49.680
is over, so I think more people are willing to wait. But I don't know. I guess then again,

09:49.680 --> 09:53.720
the Wii is still seemingly selling out and the 360 at this time last year was still selling

09:53.720 --> 09:59.600
out, too. But I don't know. I'd be very interested to see it on a graph, like how many systems

09:59.600 --> 10:04.440
Microsoft had out there at this time last year and how many Sony has out there now.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.960
You know what I mean? I mean, it's just because I'm a visual person, I want to see everything

10:06.960 --> 10:10.280
on a graph. But I'd be very interested to see how it really compares. Because you could

10:10.280 --> 10:13.840
say that the 360 was still sold out, but from what I remember, they weren't coming out very

10:13.840 --> 10:17.160
often, whereas Sony seems to be doing a pretty consistent weekly shipment.

10:17.160 --> 10:20.160
Well, according, this was the big thing that they were pushing. They were saying that we

10:20.160 --> 10:24.560
outsold the 360 because we put out a million units before the end of the year and they

10:24.560 --> 10:31.760
only had 600,000. So, yeah, but here's the thing, Microsoft's like, yeah, but bitches,

10:31.760 --> 10:38.320
we were out a year before you, so we're ahead of you by a couple of million.

10:38.320 --> 10:42.880
Okay, so Sony's saying they're on the track to outsell the 360 is what they're saying.

10:42.880 --> 10:47.000
But Microsoft's saying, we lapped you, bitch.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.240
They're just like saying, oh, we're meeting our numbers. Yeah, well, when you drop your

10:51.240 --> 10:57.480
numbers like six times and then you're like, oh, yeah, we met our numbers fucking six months

10:57.480 --> 11:04.360
late and we lowered them a bit, but we met them. God damn it, we met them. I mean, no,

11:04.360 --> 11:09.080
you didn't technically meet them because, well, you only ship less than 400,000 units

11:09.080 --> 11:11.880
that launch in the US, so whatever.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.320
The CDR dollar bill says this is Sony math.

11:14.320 --> 11:15.320
Exactly.

11:15.320 --> 11:25.360
Remember, it's the math of those who eat crayons every day. Well, we have a little bit of something

11:25.360 --> 11:31.320
flying around on the rumor mill. There is a rumor going around that Coded Arms Assault

11:31.320 --> 11:39.640
has been canceled. The information states that Famitsu leaked it, but Konami hasn't

11:39.640 --> 11:46.200
really confirmed anything yet. However, I do believe it's off release lists.

11:46.200 --> 11:51.560
Interesting. I'm trying to think back to when we were at that last Konami event that they

11:51.560 --> 11:55.200
had in, what, August, and I remember they were showing Coded Arms on the PSP, right,

11:55.200 --> 11:56.200
Loki?

11:56.200 --> 11:57.200
Yeah.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.800
But they never showed us Coded Arms on PS3, but I remember some of the other journalists

11:58.800 --> 12:02.840
were asking about it. They were really dodgy at the questions at the time, huh, if I remember

12:02.840 --> 12:05.320
right. It's like they didn't want to say much about it.

12:05.320 --> 12:08.200
Well, at E3, I think it was only a video.

12:08.200 --> 12:13.520
Yeah. Well, this other press event we went to was after that, but they still were not

12:13.520 --> 12:14.520
really saying much about it, huh?

12:14.520 --> 12:16.080
Well, I guess we'll find out in a few weeks.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.400
Yeah, this is interesting. Ah, yes, it's true. I guess Konami has another event coming up,

12:19.400 --> 12:21.160
so we'll see for sure then.

12:21.160 --> 12:25.440
Personally, from the distribution point, we've only seen dates for the PSP version. I haven't

12:25.440 --> 12:30.040
seen anything for the PS3. Although, I went down to the PS3 one, probably coming out towards

12:30.040 --> 12:31.040
Christmas anyways.

12:31.040 --> 12:35.880
Do you think it's because Coded Arms just hasn't been a very well-received series?

12:35.880 --> 12:45.120
I want to say I heard that the game was really buggy and crappy from the beta or whatever

12:45.120 --> 12:50.720
state it's in right now, alpha or whatever, that it hasn't been very good. I think right

12:50.720 --> 12:55.500
now, if anything, I don't know if it's canceled, but it may be put on hold or maybe just way

12:55.500 --> 13:01.240
behind in development schedule. I don't know. It's not coming out any time soon either way.

13:01.240 --> 13:05.360
Mystic Gohan says, Well, Coded Arms sucks, so I'm not getting my hopes up yet. Legend

13:05.360 --> 13:09.300
of Zaku says, The only thing that can save PlayStation 3 is Metal Gear Solid 4. Mike

13:09.300 --> 13:11.800
W. also agrees, Coded Arms sucked ass.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.440
I don't really think you need to save the PlayStation 3. The only thing that can save

13:14.440 --> 13:18.400
the PlayStation 3 is put more games out. That's about it. And put more games out that haven't

13:18.400 --> 13:22.880
been out for six months on the 360. I mean, that's what they need to do. I mean, why the

13:22.880 --> 13:27.700
fuck are, seriously, games that are supposed to be launch titles like Rainbow Six Vegas

13:27.700 --> 13:31.920
or something like that and they haven't even put it out yet. I mean, come on. That's the

13:31.920 --> 13:32.920
problem.

13:32.920 --> 13:44.240
Anyways, so, as we were, you know, probably talking about here, Metal Gear Solid and how

13:44.240 --> 13:48.160
Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3. Well, Metal Gear Solid Portable

13:48.160 --> 13:52.720
Ops just came out on the PSP. Not a huge surprise that they're talking about getting a sequel

13:52.720 --> 13:57.940
done already. And, you know, since the game sold pretty well, I mean, maybe not as well

13:57.940 --> 14:03.320
as they would hope, you know, not exactly a system seller, but it's doing very well

14:03.320 --> 14:07.120
and definitely going to be, you know, a sequel that's going to be coming, so.

14:07.120 --> 14:14.120
Wait, so you mean a game as popular and well received as Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops

14:14.120 --> 14:18.680
for, you know, being one of the greatest games on the PSP, according to most people, it's

14:18.680 --> 14:19.680
getting a sequel?

14:19.680 --> 14:20.680
I know, that's a shock.

14:20.680 --> 14:21.680
A shock of the century.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.840
And the sequel will be called Metal Gear Acid 3.

14:24.840 --> 14:30.000
Oh, I hope not. But maybe it'll come with cool 3D glasses. That was actually...

14:30.000 --> 14:34.560
Metal Gear Acid is like what happens when you program a game on acid.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.680
You know what, though? The 3D thing I actually thought was kind of cute. I have to admit,

14:37.680 --> 14:41.840
that little, you know, the little paper glasses or whatever they're playing Acid 2 on, it's

14:41.840 --> 14:42.840
actually kind of cute.

14:42.840 --> 14:43.840
Well, it's cute watching Dan play it.

14:43.840 --> 14:48.560
You know what the best part about the 3D glasses were? The videos of the hot Asian chicks wearing

14:48.560 --> 14:57.600
the camo bikinis that you would unlock from playing the game. In 3D. Anyway, I thought

14:57.600 --> 14:59.160
you got laid on a regular basis.

14:59.160 --> 15:03.920
Do not even talk about Asian girls in bikinis and things because...

15:03.920 --> 15:06.880
Yeah, how's Dead or Alive Xtreme going?

15:06.880 --> 15:13.300
I'm actually referring to a video that one of our listeners, I don't know if he wants

15:13.300 --> 15:20.600
to tell me, but he just laughed at it. I got sent a Para Para videos with really ugly,

15:20.600 --> 15:32.800
way too skinny Japanese girls in ganguro makeup. So, you can't say those words together without

15:32.800 --> 15:34.800
me freaking out a little bit.

15:34.800 --> 15:40.320
We had some weirder stuff with the Asian girls on the Wednesday show.

15:40.320 --> 15:44.740
I'm not even going there. Let's move on to one other way that listeners can interact

15:44.740 --> 15:52.840
with us and give their feedback is our voicemail. Our 800 number, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR. It's

15:52.840 --> 15:58.000
1-877-GAME-OLR. We got some voicemails this week, thanks to those of you guys that left

15:58.000 --> 16:02.280
the voicemails. That number is toll free in the US and Canada, but I want to point out

16:02.280 --> 16:06.820
it's not toll free outside of that, which makes this first voicemail all the more special.

16:06.820 --> 16:11.160
This actually came in on the Skype part of that, because if you are in the UK or Australia,

16:11.160 --> 16:14.840
New Zealand, wherever the heck you are in the world, you can use the Skype to leave

16:14.840 --> 16:18.300
us a message for free. You can just call Orange Lounge Radio when we're not live and leave

16:18.300 --> 16:21.880
us a voicemail. That's what this first voicemail is from. Let's take a listen.

16:21.880 --> 16:28.720
Hey, guys. This is Shoshia from the UK. I was just wondering, you mentioned every Xtend

16:28.720 --> 16:34.640
Xtra on the show a couple of times, so I looked it up. It's not coming out in the UK until

16:34.640 --> 16:40.080
the middle of February, and I was wondering if you'd be importing it off eBay, and also,

16:40.080 --> 16:46.720
is DDR Supernova worth the wait, because it's coming out in February as well, I think. Anyway,

16:46.720 --> 16:51.160
guys, keep up the good work. I love listening to the show, especially when I'm on the bus,

16:51.160 --> 16:56.080
because bus rides are so boring, and I do get funny looks when I start laughing at all

16:56.080 --> 17:00.160
the weird stuff you come out with. Anyway, guys, see you.

17:00.160 --> 17:06.680
Thank you for the voicemail. That was pretty awesome. Let's see. As far as every Xtend

17:06.680 --> 17:14.400
Xtra goes, you can actually play for free on the internet. You can download every Xtend,

17:14.400 --> 17:18.420
which is the game that it's based off of. In fact, I want to say Dark Tetsuya posted

17:18.420 --> 17:23.160
this in one of our forums. In the PC gaming forum we have, he actually posted a link to

17:23.160 --> 17:27.040
a bunch of free games you can download, and every Xtend was one of them. If you're not

17:27.040 --> 17:30.760
sure if you'd like the game or not, check that out. You can actually play that on the

17:30.760 --> 17:37.960
PC, and then just imagine the Mizuguchi touch to that, the hyper colors and the themes and

17:37.960 --> 17:42.920
the looks to it. The demo that comes with Luminous 2 gives you a little bit of a good

17:42.920 --> 17:46.720
feel for what the game's about, but it doesn't quite show you how the skin changes and things

17:46.720 --> 17:50.720
affect the game. You have to remember that the entire look of the game really changes

17:50.720 --> 17:56.240
in between stages. The game's pretty fun. It's no Luminous. I don't hold it up to that

17:56.240 --> 18:01.320
same high caliber, and it's a little more action than it is puzzle. It's more of a fast

18:01.320 --> 18:04.920
paced puzzle game. There's definitely a lot of action element involved, but it's pretty

18:04.920 --> 18:09.240
cool. As far as DDR Supernova, it's kind of hard to tell because the game varies from

18:09.240 --> 18:13.400
region to region because of licenses, but here in America I did think Supernova was

18:13.400 --> 18:19.000
probably about on the same level with DDR Extreme 2, if not a little bit better. I'd

18:19.000 --> 18:22.760
say it's worth your time if you're a DDR fan, or if you've never played the series before,

18:22.760 --> 18:27.560
it's certainly a good enabler. From what I remember, the UK, in my opinion anyway, typically

18:27.560 --> 18:31.920
gets better licenses anyway than we do, so I'm sure it's going to be even more worth

18:31.920 --> 18:44.920
your while. I'd have to say that the last Stepping Stage had a really, really good track

18:44.920 --> 18:49.400
list. I'd hope that some of those would be incorporated into some of our releases, but

18:49.400 --> 18:55.360
unfortunately no. Well yeah, it's always a licensing issue, and the music that sells

18:55.360 --> 18:58.800
over there isn't the same that sells over here all the time. Some of the hits are the

18:58.800 --> 19:03.880
same, but for instance, take an artist like Robbie Williams over there, freaking huge,

19:03.880 --> 19:09.180
popular, but over here he's really struggling. They've tried so many times to make him popular

19:09.180 --> 19:13.320
here and he just hasn't really caught on. I personally wanted the Ash song in there

19:13.320 --> 19:18.680
because I really like that band. Let's go to our second one. By the way, thank you very

19:18.680 --> 19:21.720
much for the voicemail, we appreciate it. And the compliments they left, we cracked

19:21.720 --> 19:26.960
them up on the bus or the subway, one of the two. Oh, the bus. So thank you, that's very

19:26.960 --> 19:30.560
nice, appreciate it. Remember, the biggest way we can help spread the word about Orange

19:30.560 --> 19:34.160
Laundry Radio is word of mouth, so you laughing on the bus and someone asking you what are

19:34.160 --> 19:38.920
you listening to is like, seriously, that's a compliment to us. Let's go to our next voicemail.

19:38.920 --> 19:44.320
Hi, this is Razorburn 2021. You will never see me in the chat room, you'll probably never

19:44.320 --> 19:51.240
see me around. I happen to be an offline listener. I listen via my PSP and Bleaching Connections.

19:51.240 --> 19:57.080
I just wanted to thank you for a very nice year of episodes. I listen to them at work

19:57.080 --> 20:02.860
and they really provide me with the news, albeit it's generally kind of a week late

20:02.860 --> 20:07.680
of stuff, but it's a way I'm able to keep up on what's going on in the gaming world.

20:07.680 --> 20:11.120
I've kind of jumped back and forth between a lot of podcasts. You're one of the first

20:11.120 --> 20:16.680
ones I picked up and I've stuck with you. I'm just really happy with your show and I

20:16.680 --> 20:22.360
wanted to wish you a happy new year and say thank you and please provide me with one in

20:22.360 --> 20:23.360
the future.

20:23.360 --> 20:27.440
Aw, thanks for the warm fuzzies. We appreciate that. We like the little compliments to keep

20:27.440 --> 20:31.960
us going. That was very nice. All things to say, there's a purposeful reason why I play

20:31.960 --> 20:37.920
this one because he said that he listened to the show on the PSP. I think last week

20:37.920 --> 20:42.240
on the New Year's Eve special I was a little bit harsh on the PSP, so I wish to clarify

20:42.240 --> 20:49.960
my statements on the PSP just to say I do really like the PSP as a multimedia device.

20:49.960 --> 20:56.080
It is an incredible multimedia device. I mean it plays videos, MP3s, and games and all the

20:56.080 --> 21:00.840
movie stuff on top of that. The problem is as a gaming device solely, I don't think it's

21:00.840 --> 21:04.200
up to par with the DS and that's my own personal opinion. I don't think the library of games

21:04.200 --> 21:08.560
that the PSP is offering is quite up to par with the DS, but I think the fact that people

21:08.560 --> 21:14.480
do listen to the show on the PSP kind of speaks to why the PSP is a pretty good system because

21:14.480 --> 21:18.440
of the fact, hey, not only can you listen to these RSS feeds on the go over the internet,

21:18.440 --> 21:24.800
but you can play Luminous too. I mean that's what's great about the PSP and why if you

21:24.800 --> 21:30.560
don't own one you should think about it. I mean they really are pretty decent systems.

21:30.560 --> 21:35.680
If you're only looking for gaming and maybe you already have an iPod, you already have

21:35.680 --> 21:41.040
a laptop to get your podcast on the go or whatever, maybe you don't need it. But if

21:41.040 --> 21:44.040
you don't have any of that stuff I think the PSP is a pretty good buy to get a lot of that

21:44.040 --> 21:45.040
crap on the go.

21:45.040 --> 21:49.160
If you haven't bought one yet you might want to just hold off anyways because what the

21:49.160 --> 21:55.080
rumor mill has been saying is that they're going to redesign it anyways, so better to

21:55.080 --> 21:59.800
wait and not get caught in one of those DS DS Lite Fiasco's.

21:59.800 --> 22:04.200
Rama in our chat room says, Rob, if you want a multimedia device get a computer. Well,

22:04.200 --> 22:07.160
silly, I'm talking about portable devices obviously.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.160
Laptop.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.440
Well, but laptops are thousands of dollars for a good one.

22:11.440 --> 22:15.280
And they're not that portable, but you've got to whip this thing out, it's not that

22:15.280 --> 22:16.280
portable.

22:16.280 --> 22:17.280
Yeah, the little ones, sidekick.

22:17.280 --> 22:22.560
Okay, but PSP goes near, but sidekick. A PSP is better than a sidekick, I think, except

22:22.560 --> 22:26.880
for the fact you can't make calls with a PSP. I already have a phone. I think the PSP is

22:26.880 --> 22:30.300
a pretty cool little pocket system.

22:30.300 --> 22:31.600
How big are your pockets?

22:31.600 --> 22:35.640
Big. I can fit PSP in my pocket no problem.

22:35.640 --> 22:38.440
My DS fits in my purse. That little micro thing.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.560
Your PSP could probably fit in your purse, too.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.560
No, it wouldn't.

22:41.560 --> 22:42.560
Really?

22:42.560 --> 22:43.560
No, I can barely get...

22:43.560 --> 22:44.560
You have too much in your purse.

22:44.560 --> 22:47.560
I have no idea what happened to my sonic screwdriver. It fell out of my purse.

22:47.560 --> 22:48.560
That sucks.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.560
It doesn't even that fit.

22:50.560 --> 22:56.120
Alright, and there was another comment in here somewhere I wanted to read. Well, I guess

22:56.120 --> 23:01.200
that was it. I can't find the other one, so there you have it. Chat.orangewansradio.com

23:01.200 --> 23:05.160
if you're listening live on this Sunday night and you want to join or entertain your thoughts.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.840
And of course, the chat room is open all week long and it gets kind of dead when there's

23:07.840 --> 23:08.840
no live programming.

23:08.840 --> 23:09.840
I have to agree with Ron Law on this.

23:09.840 --> 23:10.840
What do I want to say?

23:10.840 --> 23:14.440
A laptop may be thousands of dollars, but it is more useful than a damn PSP.

23:14.440 --> 23:19.680
But if you're, okay, but you know, if you're a 14-year-old kid, you may not have a need

23:19.680 --> 23:20.680
for a laptop.

23:20.680 --> 23:23.160
They make very small laptops, too. There's new Vios.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.960
I just think, you know, yes, a laptop you get a lot of value of, but you have to ask

23:26.960 --> 23:28.720
yourself, do you really need all that stuff?

23:28.720 --> 23:33.720
I mean, how easy is it to turn on your PSP, click, have the headphones in, and listen

23:33.720 --> 23:37.960
to the show as opposed to, ah, I better whip out the laptop, fire up iTunes, da-da-da.

23:37.960 --> 23:41.240
I mean, don't get me wrong. A laptop serves a very useful purpose.

23:41.240 --> 23:46.640
I heart my little Mac laptop and it's one of the best purchases I made last year.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.840
But, you know, I still also like my PSP for those types of things.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.840
I need a bigger memory card, though.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.080
All right.

23:55.080 --> 23:59.440
You can also interact with us by sending us e-mails to mailbag at orangeontraday.com,

23:59.440 --> 24:01.760
and we will get to the mailbag a little bit later in the show.

24:01.760 --> 24:05.800
But first, more news, and we'll start off with this story.

24:05.800 --> 24:11.600
Coming from Korea, game censorship, a hot topic worldwide, not just Korea, but worldwide.

24:11.600 --> 24:16.180
Of course, you know, in 2006, we had Rule of Rose causing the problems in Europe and

24:16.180 --> 24:21.200
Tak Jomsom getting his head into everything over here, which would just go away.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.200
Other than a pizazz?

24:22.200 --> 24:23.200
Yes.

24:23.200 --> 24:29.160
In South Korea, things are actually going kind of maybe a little more in favor of games.

24:29.160 --> 24:34.040
Now, games that have previously depicted military and political actions against North Korea

24:34.040 --> 24:38.000
have been banned because they were a little bit too touchy with, you know, the political

24:38.000 --> 24:39.880
situations going on in the world.

24:39.880 --> 24:44.980
So they said that Tom Clancy goes to Recon 2 and Splinter Cell Chaos Theories and Mercenaries.

24:44.980 --> 24:45.980
No go.

24:45.980 --> 24:46.980
They're banned.

24:46.980 --> 24:47.980
Banned games.

24:47.980 --> 24:50.480
But what just recently happened, the game reading board of Korea actually said that

24:50.480 --> 24:55.200
they are going to lift the ban, and in 2007, these games will become available.

24:55.200 --> 25:00.600
And the head of the rating board, Kim Ki-Man, said in the Korea Times, quote, the reasoning

25:00.600 --> 25:05.640
behind the decision was said to be to allow freedom of expression.

25:05.640 --> 25:08.240
So there you go.

25:08.240 --> 25:12.320
So that's pretty cool, I think, that, you know, I don't think any of us particularly

25:12.320 --> 25:13.560
enjoy censorship.

25:13.560 --> 25:17.940
We sometimes take for granted the free world we live in here in this particular country.

25:17.940 --> 25:21.160
So I think it's very nice that, you know, other folks are getting to experience some

25:21.160 --> 25:23.160
of the same art forms we do here.

25:23.160 --> 25:25.120
I don't think anyone takes that stuff too seriously.

25:25.120 --> 25:29.440
You know, I don't, you know, go, oh my gosh, because I'm fighting against the North Koreans

25:29.440 --> 25:32.400
in this game, I have to do that in real life, too.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.940
I don't think anyone's that stupid.

25:33.940 --> 25:34.940
I would hope.

25:34.940 --> 25:35.940
I would really, really hope.

25:35.940 --> 25:42.360
Well, I'm all for expression, and it looks like there's another way to express yourself.

25:42.360 --> 25:48.440
And that's by turning your Wii into a vibrator, your Wiimote into a vibrator.

25:48.440 --> 25:53.480
Hey, it was, it can be done with the Rez trans vibrator.

25:53.480 --> 25:59.120
We can have the Hello Kitty and I found a Doraemon vibrator on eBay.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.240
Okay.

26:00.240 --> 26:04.480
Not that I want to be entertaining this notion, but doesn't the Wii kind of already vibrate?

26:04.480 --> 26:07.440
Like I know whenever I'm using that stupid keyboard thing on the Wii, it's like that

26:07.440 --> 26:11.160
thing keeps constantly shaking in my hand as I move around the keyboard.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.400
So what are we talking about here?

26:13.400 --> 26:27.080
There is one that, it's a program that's put out by Kako, shut up, K-A-K-O.

26:27.080 --> 26:33.440
You download it to your PC, hook it up through your Bluetooth, and it vibrates on command,

26:33.440 --> 26:34.440
I guess.

26:34.440 --> 26:36.880
You know, I want to say, though, there was an easier way to do this.

26:36.880 --> 26:42.480
Someone was posting before there was some sort of flaw in the Opera browser with a,

26:42.480 --> 26:48.280
I guess it was a URL that's too long or something, the tag, will cause your browser to crash

26:48.280 --> 26:52.440
and I think it causes the remote to vibrate as well and I think that might be an easier

26:52.440 --> 26:53.440
way to do that.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.440
Okay.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.720
So something easier than using your Kako?

26:55.720 --> 26:56.720
Yes.

26:56.720 --> 26:57.720
Okay.

26:57.720 --> 26:58.720
I'm looking at the guy's site, actually.

26:58.720 --> 27:04.080
There's a Wii Remote Test, Wii Sabre.

27:04.080 --> 27:07.480
There's um, okay, I can't read this.

27:07.480 --> 27:18.240
Wii Braider Test, Wii Mice Test, Wii Fall Detect Test, Wii Remote IR Sensor Test, Wii

27:18.240 --> 27:26.760
Pointer Test, Wii Nunchaku Test, a bunch of stuff.

27:26.760 --> 27:27.760
This is crazy.

27:27.760 --> 27:37.880
I'm linking this, though, in the chatroom so that they, too, can enjoy the Wii Braider.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.800
The joys of the Wii.

27:39.800 --> 27:47.760
Well, a couple websites out there want you to enjoy the Wii as well, especially when

27:47.760 --> 27:48.760
it comes to porn.

27:48.760 --> 27:56.120
Yes, a few websites out there are making their porno Wii friendly.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.120
Wait, this reminds me.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.840
Jamie, did I tell you about what we did on New Year's Eve?

27:59.840 --> 28:00.840
Orgy?

28:00.840 --> 28:01.840
No.

28:01.840 --> 28:02.840
We had about 12 people over here.

28:02.840 --> 28:03.840
You called me drunk!

28:03.840 --> 28:09.480
No, we had about 12 people over here and we had this, you know, somebody that we know

28:09.480 --> 28:11.940
had said they'd never seen a porno before.

28:11.940 --> 28:17.440
So we decided to use the internet browsing capabilities of the Wii to surf to pornotube.com

28:17.440 --> 28:24.740
and bring it up on the Wii and actually, and by the way, if you're under 18, don't do this.

28:24.740 --> 28:29.600
But yeah, we looked up, let me just say the first thing we clicked on, because we couldn't

28:29.600 --> 28:33.760
resist, said pterodactyl porn.

28:33.760 --> 28:39.180
Yeah, it really is what it sounds like.

28:39.180 --> 28:40.180
It's something to behold.

28:40.180 --> 28:42.180
I'll give it that.

28:42.180 --> 28:45.000
Again, don't go to that website if you're under 18, kids.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.520
Sorry, Loki, I had to share that because you did use the Wii for pornographic purposes

28:49.520 --> 28:50.520
already.

28:50.520 --> 28:54.200
Oh yeah, we've been on it a few times.

28:54.200 --> 29:00.640
So, yeah, it was apparently one of the free adult sites out there and if you're curious

29:00.640 --> 29:07.040
on wondering what site, I'm not really going to give them free advertising, but it's listed

29:07.040 --> 29:08.040
on rstecnica.com.

29:08.040 --> 29:12.040
If you go to the free site, apparently...

29:12.040 --> 29:14.880
So you're giving free advertising by proxy?

29:14.880 --> 29:16.880
Yes.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.880
You make no sense.

29:17.880 --> 29:19.860
It's a free porn site out there.

29:19.860 --> 29:23.560
One I have never heard of, by the way.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.800
Porn doesn't look that good, by the way.

29:25.800 --> 29:30.120
Anyway, so it's free and apparently it's Wii friendly.

29:30.120 --> 29:32.920
So it's kind of neat that they're...

29:32.920 --> 29:37.240
And usually, it's kind of funny, porn studios are usually ahead of the game for the most

29:37.240 --> 29:38.240
part with technology.

29:38.240 --> 29:44.840
I know porn studios were the first ones that actually have, I think, DVDs and recordable

29:44.840 --> 29:50.820
VHS stuff as well, and now that they're kind of making content for the PSP and the Wii

29:50.820 --> 29:56.760
and God knows what other browsers out there, so not a huge surprise.

29:56.760 --> 29:58.680
That's kind of cool, though.

29:58.680 --> 30:02.840
Just think of all the porn sites that are going to use that play on the Wii name.

30:02.840 --> 30:07.600
Just think of all the Fox News stories we're going to see about how the Wii is a gateway

30:07.600 --> 30:14.680
to porno for your children, wah, evil.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.500
Sometimes I wish this next guy would just go away.

30:17.500 --> 30:21.920
This story about Uwe Boll, who, you know, he's that famed director who brought us such

30:21.920 --> 30:24.360
cinema classics as BloodRayne.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.520
Whatever happened to the fucking Dungeon Siege movie?

30:26.520 --> 30:27.520
Did that actually come out?

30:27.520 --> 30:28.520
Wasn't that supposed to come out in 2006?

30:28.520 --> 30:29.520
It hasn't come out yet.

30:29.520 --> 30:32.520
It was supposed to come out in 2006 and it got delayed until, I think, March.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.360
It got delayed for all eternity.

30:34.360 --> 30:39.160
Well, Uwe Boll is making a movie out of Far Cry right now, and I have this interesting

30:39.160 --> 30:40.160
quote to say.

30:40.160 --> 30:44.100
Quote, every other game I did so far, the game makers were happy I did a movie to support

30:44.100 --> 30:45.280
their franchise.

30:45.280 --> 30:52.660
With Far Cry, Ubisoft wants me to make a good movie because this is already a big franchise

30:52.660 --> 30:54.480
for them and they want to keep it going.

30:54.480 --> 30:58.400
I think they will be more involved in the whole process than the other companies before.

30:58.400 --> 31:03.320
We always want to make a good movie.

31:03.320 --> 31:07.800
In the past, the game companies never co-promoted the movie or even had a new game come out

31:07.800 --> 31:09.320
with a movie.

31:09.320 --> 31:13.600
Uwe, those guys could have promoted the movies all they wanted to.

31:13.600 --> 31:17.920
They could have had the money pouring out their butts, but if the movie sucked, that's

31:17.920 --> 31:20.160
not going to suddenly make the movie better.

31:20.160 --> 31:24.680
There's probably a reason they didn't promote the movie because when they saw it, they probably

31:24.680 --> 31:29.080
said, why did we ever sign over the rights to this god-awful man?

31:29.080 --> 31:35.600
They even included free copies of the PC version of Blood Rain and it's still in that cell,

31:35.600 --> 31:36.600
Blood Rain, the DVD.

31:36.600 --> 31:40.400
Well, actually, I guess Blood Rain DVD sold okay, but that's because no one saw it in

31:40.400 --> 31:41.400
the theaters.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.920
Because everyone heard that one chick was naked.

31:42.920 --> 31:47.400
I bet you that's why they sold two million copies.

31:47.400 --> 31:54.600
Do like the rest of us and just see it on a website for free.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.920
It's kind of funny they mention Far Cry and stuff because I really hope they don't kill

31:57.920 --> 31:58.920
that franchise.

31:58.920 --> 32:02.000
They can go ahead and kill all these other ones that have been dead for a long time,

32:02.000 --> 32:07.120
but just stay away from the good franchises.

32:07.120 --> 32:11.840
Whenever Uwe Boll manages to make its way into our show script for what stories we're

32:11.840 --> 32:14.320
going to read, I feel a little dead inside.

32:14.320 --> 32:18.640
That makes me very angsty, so I think it's an appropriate time for us to bring on the

32:18.640 --> 32:26.640
FUs of the week, don't you think?

32:26.640 --> 32:30.320
Yes.

32:30.320 --> 32:42.720
FU goes towards money, damn money, damn having to pay for everything.

32:42.720 --> 32:49.680
I am an advocate of working hard for the things I just want, but damn the fact that I have

32:49.680 --> 32:56.040
to shell out $415 tomorrow to pay for my first deposit for school and my books.

32:56.040 --> 33:01.120
And then I have to do another $285, and another $285, and another $285 until I'm done.

33:01.120 --> 33:08.320
Which I'll be done at the end of March, and a $1400 gamble to make an extra $17000 a year

33:08.320 --> 33:16.400
working less hours is awfully nice, but at the same time, that's a lot of money right

33:16.400 --> 33:17.400
now.

33:17.400 --> 33:22.680
I got to see rent, so yeah, fuck money.

33:22.680 --> 33:27.680
Black Boy says boo-hoo, Dark Sakura has to pay for school.

33:27.680 --> 33:34.800
I've been in college now, off and on, over the past 10-11 years or so, and I finally

33:34.800 --> 33:41.600
found something that I really, really want to do.

33:41.600 --> 33:49.400
And I think that it'll pay off, but for right now, I'm entitled to sit back and look at

33:49.400 --> 33:52.760
this and say, how the hell am I going to steam this?

33:52.760 --> 33:57.400
So I think I'm going to make it work, it'll be worth it, but at the same time.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.600
Now you just got called a career student.

33:59.600 --> 34:05.280
I am, you know what, my theory is to never stop learning, honestly.

34:05.280 --> 34:10.120
The moment that you stop learning and let yourself fall into stagnant ignorance is the

34:10.120 --> 34:11.840
day you should shoot yourself in the head.

34:11.840 --> 34:15.800
Well it's a good thing we fill your head full of news every week on this program so you

34:15.800 --> 34:17.240
can consistently learn something new.

34:17.240 --> 34:19.440
I am proud to be a career student.

34:19.440 --> 34:24.160
No matter how long I work, no matter what I do, I'm still going to be learning something.

34:24.160 --> 34:28.000
I'm a teacher kind of, so do I get props?

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
No.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Go to school.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.240
Low key.

34:31.240 --> 34:36.560
One lesson I hope that was learned today was the kids out front of your apartment complex,

34:36.560 --> 34:41.920
thank you to them for being dumb enough to leave their remote controlled car parked in

34:41.920 --> 34:43.920
an empty space.

34:43.920 --> 34:48.640
So when I pulled my car in there, I crushed the car and the kid cried, and he was just

34:48.640 --> 34:49.640
like, my car!

34:49.640 --> 34:50.640
It's crushed!

34:50.640 --> 34:53.600
Well, you're a dumbass and you left it in the space.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.720
I feel no remorse for you.

34:55.720 --> 35:01.240
That'll teach you to put away your damn toys and stop playing in the goddamn street.

35:01.240 --> 35:04.120
If I went to stripping school, would that count?

35:04.120 --> 35:05.120
Yes.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.120
Cool.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.120
You'd be learning a skill.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.560
A necessary job function.

35:08.560 --> 35:11.200
They could eventually make you like a dollar.

35:11.200 --> 35:15.160
I would probably make more money doing that than I do what I do now.

35:15.160 --> 35:21.360
I got to lose my little pooch here, but maybe I should look into it.

35:21.360 --> 35:24.680
I just don't want to have to grow my hair out to look like thunder down under.

35:24.680 --> 35:32.240
Why is this on our program?

35:32.240 --> 35:37.120
I want to say an F you to these kettle chips that are Tuscan three cheese flavor because

35:37.120 --> 35:42.680
I've almost eaten the whole freaking bag sitting right here and that's not healthy.

35:42.680 --> 35:46.520
I love how I'm talking about exercising and working out and then I'm like, I just ate

35:46.520 --> 35:52.240
a whole bag of potato chips and I wonder why I'm fat.

35:52.240 --> 35:53.240
They're like really good chips though.

35:53.240 --> 35:56.560
An F you to having no self control.

35:56.560 --> 35:57.560
Kill me now.

35:57.560 --> 35:58.560
Okay.

35:58.560 --> 35:59.560
Thanks.

35:59.560 --> 36:00.560
They're really good chips though.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.560
They're like the best chips in the world.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.560
Kill me now.

36:02.560 --> 36:03.560
I want to die.

36:03.560 --> 36:04.560
Can I?

36:04.560 --> 36:05.560
No.

36:05.560 --> 36:06.560
Oh, okay.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.220
You can die soon and it will make you not want to die.

36:08.220 --> 36:09.680
Guess what?

36:09.680 --> 36:10.680
What?

36:10.680 --> 36:15.380
Silent Hill 2 yeah, I am so happy there's going to be a Silent Hill 2 Marketplace.

36:15.380 --> 36:21.200
Christophe Gans said he's working on the second Silent Hill movie script which is being written

36:21.200 --> 36:26.600
by Rodger Avery.

36:26.600 --> 36:30.960
They were actually saying that it was going to be written by Neil Gaiman, but he's actually

36:30.960 --> 36:36.000
said on his blog that he actually doesn't really have any involvement in it.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.200
From what I understand, I think he might be a consultant, but I don't think he's actually involved much in the actual thing.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.000
But hey, at Sutton Hill, happy.

36:45.300 --> 36:47.800
You probably like the movie more than anyone else I know, so...

36:47.800 --> 36:49.100
I've seen it four times in the theater.

36:49.100 --> 36:49.900
Oh my god.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.200
And I'm going to be buying the Blu-ray Disc soon.

36:52.300 --> 36:52.800
Yeah?

36:53.100 --> 36:54.800
So I can turn off all the lights and go,

36:54.800 --> 36:55.600
Ooh.

36:55.900 --> 36:56.600
Ooh.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.000
Worship Pyramid Head, build a shrine of fire.

36:58.000 --> 36:58.900
No!

36:59.300 --> 37:03.000
I don't know why everyone thinks that I'm this big Red Pyramid fangirl.

37:03.300 --> 37:04.100
Because you are.

37:04.100 --> 37:05.600
No.

37:06.600 --> 37:11.100
I love the entire story, the entire feel of the game.

37:11.100 --> 37:13.600
I love the whole mythology behind it.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.600
But Pyramid Head, Red Pyramid, whatever, symbolizes all of that in one...

37:16.600 --> 37:17.600
No, it does not.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.600
Fancy little hot body.

37:18.600 --> 37:22.100
Red Pyramid is the guy in the second game's repressed sexuality.

37:22.100 --> 37:24.600
Because he goes around raping all the female monsters...

37:24.600 --> 37:26.100
OMG, spoilers!

37:26.100 --> 37:27.100
Oh, come on.

37:27.600 --> 37:30.100
The game's been out for, what, five years?

37:30.600 --> 37:32.100
I think people should know by now.

37:32.600 --> 37:33.600
Guess what?

37:33.600 --> 37:34.100
What?

37:34.600 --> 37:36.600
Red Pyramid kills Dumbledore.

37:38.100 --> 37:39.100
You're done.

37:39.100 --> 37:41.600
Speaking of jokes that are years old, thank you for that.

37:44.600 --> 37:49.100
Anyways, so something that doesn't have to do with rape or Silent Hill.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.100
Nintendo was...

37:51.100 --> 37:52.600
All of them, forget it. I don't want to hear it.

37:53.100 --> 37:54.100
Moving on.

37:54.600 --> 37:55.100
Just kidding.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.600
Nintendo has partnered up with MMO producer Nexon.

37:58.600 --> 38:03.600
And really there's no news other than just that.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.600
They don't really know why they partner up.

38:06.600 --> 38:12.100
But it seems to be that the general consensus is they're working on new MapleStory.

38:12.100 --> 38:15.100
MapleStory DS or possibly MapleStory Wii.

38:16.100 --> 38:17.600
So that should be interesting.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.600
I'm always for more games.

38:19.600 --> 38:23.100
And especially if it's going to be an MMO, that would be pretty cool too.

38:23.600 --> 38:27.100
Why am I not surprised that if Nintendo was going to partner up with any MMO maker,

38:27.100 --> 38:29.100
it would be the folks that made MapleStory?

38:30.100 --> 38:31.100
It's very interesting.

38:31.100 --> 38:34.100
What do you think we might have in store for us on the Wii?

38:34.100 --> 38:35.100
I've just never...

38:35.100 --> 38:37.600
I've never thought of an MMO on a Nintendo system.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.100
I mean, it's never really happened before,

38:39.100 --> 38:42.100
with the exception of Phantasy Star Online on the GameCube.

38:42.100 --> 38:45.100
But let's face it, Nintendo really didn't support that the way they should have.

38:45.100 --> 38:51.100
So that fluke aside, there's not really been MMOs on Nintendo systems that I can think of.

38:51.100 --> 38:52.600
So this is very interesting to me.

38:53.100 --> 38:54.100
Yeah, I don't know.

38:54.100 --> 38:55.100
I don't know, it's...

38:56.100 --> 38:59.100
I was surprised that they weren't actually partnering up.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.100
What was that one wiki?

39:02.100 --> 39:06.100
Because that kind of looked very similar to Wind Waker.

39:06.100 --> 39:10.100
So that would be kind of funny if they took that over and made a game based on that.

39:10.100 --> 39:14.100
But MapleStory, based on the graphics of the game and stuff,

39:14.100 --> 39:18.100
I think that it would fit on Nintendo console pretty well.

39:18.100 --> 39:20.100
I would like to see it as a Wii game,

39:20.100 --> 39:27.100
because I think it might need a little bit more processor power to actually put out the graphics and stuff.

39:27.100 --> 39:30.100
Plus, I don't know how well a DS MMO would work.

39:30.100 --> 39:31.100
Especially if you've got to pay for it.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.100
No, you don't know unless you try.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.100
True.

39:33.100 --> 39:35.100
You know, who knows what they could come out with.

39:35.100 --> 39:39.100
I would think a game like Ragnarok might actually work really well on the DS.

39:39.100 --> 39:40.100
Sad but true.

39:41.100 --> 39:42.100
Be very interesting.

39:43.100 --> 39:47.100
Anyhow, one thing we resolved to do in the year 2007 is that

39:47.100 --> 39:50.100
we're not showing PC gaming enough love on this program

39:50.100 --> 39:52.100
and some folks have brought that to our attention.

39:52.100 --> 39:57.100
So we would like to spend a little bit of time here on the show to go over some PC gaming related stories.

39:57.100 --> 40:00.100
And, okay, I guess I'm cheating a little bit with this first one,

40:00.100 --> 40:04.100
because this kind of is both PC and Xbox 360.

40:04.100 --> 40:07.100
But a lot of you guys are playing Oblivion on the PC.

40:07.100 --> 40:13.100
And this actually was recently announced by PC Gamer and PC Zone magazines.

40:13.100 --> 40:17.100
There's a new Oblivion expansion on the way called the Shivering Isles.

40:17.100 --> 40:20.100
And it only has been confirmed, well, through this for the PC so far.

40:20.100 --> 40:22.100
We don't know if this is going to come out on 360 yet.

40:22.100 --> 40:23.100
Yeah, I think it is.

40:23.100 --> 40:26.100
I imagine it would. I mean Oblivion does very well on the 360.

40:26.100 --> 40:30.100
But, anyhow, for now we know it's probably going to make its way to the PC.

40:30.100 --> 40:37.100
It will let players explore the Isles, which are divided into northern and southern areas titled Mania and Dementia.

40:37.100 --> 40:39.100
Boy, this sounds like a fun place to go.

40:39.100 --> 40:43.100
Then you'll be able to go to a door on this...

40:43.100 --> 40:49.100
The way you get there is you get to go through this door near Breville that takes you to this area.

40:49.100 --> 40:57.100
And supposedly it's going to extend Oblivion's gameplay for 30 more hours with new creatures, quests, and dungeons.

40:57.100 --> 41:03.100
One of the new quests, you'll be solving a mystery in a town on the border of Mania and Dementia.

41:03.100 --> 41:06.100
Every citizen has a look-alike in the town.

41:06.100 --> 41:12.100
Some of the new monsters in the game, the Gatekeeper, a collection of body parts that have been stitched together.

41:12.100 --> 41:13.100
Awesome.

41:13.100 --> 41:15.100
And the Knights of the Order, which are made up of three roots.

41:15.100 --> 41:16.100
Oh, you're the Gatekeeper.

41:16.100 --> 41:18.100
I'm surprised you're not playing more Oblivion.

41:18.100 --> 41:20.100
You know, because you can set fire to anything in that game, Jamie.

41:20.100 --> 41:22.100
You can play more Oblivion?

41:22.100 --> 41:25.100
No, I mean, I know you haven't even played it really at all.

41:25.100 --> 41:28.100
I'm surprised by that because I would think you'd enjoy it.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.100
But maybe it's just me.

41:29.100 --> 41:32.100
Well, I'm not going to have any time over the next three months, that's for sure.

41:32.100 --> 41:33.100
I guess, yeah.

41:33.100 --> 41:34.100
Bye-bye life!

41:34.100 --> 41:40.100
As if your life hadn't been sucked away enough into Oblivion as it is if you've been playing this game.

41:40.100 --> 41:44.100
Now they're just going to have this, which is even more hours gone away.

41:44.100 --> 41:46.100
It's amazing the types of things that people made for Oblivion.

41:46.100 --> 41:51.100
There's an Oblivion wiki out there, a Google Map-style thing for Oblivion.

41:51.100 --> 41:52.100
It's crazy.

41:52.100 --> 41:54.100
Excuse me, it's crazy.

41:54.100 --> 41:55.100
Bless you.

41:55.100 --> 41:56.100
Sorry.

41:56.100 --> 41:57.100
Live radio.

41:57.100 --> 41:58.100
Yep.

41:58.100 --> 41:59.100
We sneeze.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.100
Well, I have some news.

42:01.100 --> 42:02.100
PC-related?

42:02.100 --> 42:08.100
Actually, yep.

42:08.100 --> 42:16.100
Sony Online Entertainment is releasing, they actually have the open beta for Vanguard Saga of Heroes.

42:16.100 --> 42:21.100
It was available on the 5th.

42:21.100 --> 42:30.100
And they also have a pre-order campaign that's given to anyone who is given access to the open beta.

42:30.100 --> 42:39.100
Some of the websites have had a lot of coverage on this Vanguard game, and it looks like it could be pretty interesting if you're into those types of PC MMOs.

42:39.100 --> 42:43.100
So, I might check it out if I have some time, if I can pull myself away from Oblivion.

42:43.100 --> 42:44.100
That's kind of pretty.

42:44.100 --> 42:45.100
Yeah.

42:45.100 --> 42:50.100
Well, one game I'm looking forward to, especially even on the PC, and I know they're making a 360 version, which is awesome,

42:50.100 --> 42:57.100
but Command & Conquer 3, Tiberian Wars, they're going to get a special edition called the Kane Edition,

42:57.100 --> 43:04.100
and for those who may not have played Command & Conquer, Kane is the villain who actually, kind of funny enough,

43:04.100 --> 43:10.100
because he heads up the nod, looks like Zod from the Superman movies.

43:10.100 --> 43:13.100
So, I don't know, every time I see him I think it's Zod, but whatever.

43:13.100 --> 43:18.100
Anyway, so the special edition, what you're going to get for $59.99,

43:18.100 --> 43:26.100
you're going to get a behind-the-scenes documentary and exclusive in-game content, which is kind of cool.

43:26.100 --> 43:35.100
As well as strategy guides, deleted scenes, and bloopers from the game's live-action sequences.

43:35.100 --> 43:42.100
And, of course, some of the exclusive content, you'll get exclusive multiplayer maps, three exclusive unit skins,

43:42.100 --> 43:45.100
and a limited-edition poster.

43:45.100 --> 43:49.100
So, that'd be pretty cool.

43:49.100 --> 43:52.100
Going back to something I said earlier, because I'm reading the comments in the chat room right now,

43:52.100 --> 43:57.100
Shadowsliar says, Sky, how is that crazy? Many games have their own wiki.

43:57.100 --> 44:00.100
In reference to what I was saying, Oblivion has all that crazy stuff out there.

44:00.100 --> 44:01.100
I guess that's true.

44:01.100 --> 44:04.100
I mean, there are a lot of fan communities.

44:04.100 --> 44:08.100
With wiki being open source and everything, many fan communities throw up their own wiki.

44:08.100 --> 44:12.100
But I guess I felt like the Oblivion one just felt so vast.

44:12.100 --> 44:14.100
You know, there's so much in that freaking game.

44:14.100 --> 44:20.100
There's not a lot of games I can recall playing that have the amazing depth that Oblivion has.

44:20.100 --> 44:26.100
So, I don't know, I guess the wiki seems so vast as the game does. Does that make sense?

44:26.100 --> 44:30.100
You visit some wikis for some games and there's not a lot to it.

44:30.100 --> 44:33.100
You know, it's more like a pretty FAQ. Does that make sense?

44:33.100 --> 44:39.100
Yeah. Plus the PC version, you can get them all run around topless.

44:39.100 --> 44:42.100
Well, you do the mods and everything on the PC one, too.

44:42.100 --> 44:44.100
I really should be playing Oblivion on the PC, not the 360.

44:44.100 --> 44:47.100
But I'm such an achievement point, so I can't help myself.

44:47.100 --> 44:50.100
I really do want to get the Oblivion now for the PC.

44:50.100 --> 44:51.100
You should!

44:51.100 --> 44:52.100
I think it would be fun on my laptop.

44:52.100 --> 44:53.100
It might be.

44:53.100 --> 44:56.100
I could put the mods in. That's what I'm all about, is mods.

44:56.100 --> 44:58.100
Well, PC gamers, don't say we don't love you.

44:58.100 --> 45:04.100
Another thing maybe we need to resolve to do is give a little love to mobile gaming,

45:04.100 --> 45:06.100
although I'm not the biggest fan of mobile gaming.

45:06.100 --> 45:12.100
I've started to come around a little bit in 2006 and on into 2007.

45:12.100 --> 45:14.100
I actually really enjoyed the Luminous mobile game.

45:14.100 --> 45:18.100
There's been some other mobile games. I think DarkSakura found a couple she liked, too.

45:18.100 --> 45:21.100
Maybe we're starting to come around a little bit on the mobile stuff.

45:21.100 --> 45:25.100
Unfortunately, the only mobile story we've got for you this week is a little bit of a downer.

45:25.100 --> 45:30.100
Microsoft is being sued by a French company, Infusio,

45:30.100 --> 45:33.100
for the wrongful termination of a $2 million contract.

45:33.100 --> 45:38.100
Infusio is claiming that Microsoft was refusing to approve their game designs,

45:38.100 --> 45:44.100
wrongfully withholding the second of four $500,000 US dollar payments.

45:44.100 --> 45:50.100
This is all in regards to the Halo mobile game that I suppose is in development.

45:50.100 --> 45:54.100
I guess some disagreements there on the Halo mobile games.

45:54.100 --> 45:58.100
Well, if you ever disagree with what we have to say, you can write us an angry email.

45:58.100 --> 46:02.100
If you're immature enough, we'll just point and make fun of you.

46:02.100 --> 46:06.100
But if you have pretty well thought out opinions, we're likely to read your emails on the show

46:06.100 --> 46:09.100
because, you know, we're not saying our way or the highway.

46:09.100 --> 46:11.100
It's an open forum from all gamers.

46:11.100 --> 46:14.100
So send us your emails, mailbag at orangeonsureely.com,

46:14.100 --> 46:18.100
and DarkSakura will rip open the mailbag and tear out a few emails she wants to read.

46:18.100 --> 46:20.100
And that's what she's going to do right now.

46:27.100 --> 46:31.100
The first email comes from Tim Tsurugi.

46:31.100 --> 46:36.100
Hello, OLR. Of course, loving the show and hoping it never ends. Never.

46:36.100 --> 46:40.100
It's always nice to hear y'all's charming personalities shine every week.

46:40.100 --> 46:45.100
I'm terribly sorry for bothering y'all, but Sky Suggestion got me thinking about gambling games for the Wii.

46:45.100 --> 46:50.100
If Nintendo ever decides to get on the ball and make some Wii DS connectivity set up,

46:50.100 --> 46:56.100
you can very easily expand the playability of Wii gambling titles, such as playing poker or blackjack.

46:56.100 --> 47:00.100
Combine this with online capabilities, and I believe there could be a fulfilling Wii title.

47:00.100 --> 47:03.100
Heck, Wii Clubhouse Games. Why not?

47:03.100 --> 47:12.100
The point is Nintendo's stubborn lack of celerity and grasping the online world is mind-bogglingly nonsensical.

47:12.100 --> 47:16.100
Given Xbox 360's success through live, Nintendo could really take a hint.

47:16.100 --> 47:21.100
On a side note, four-story sequel utilizing Wii DS connectivity would just plain rock.

47:21.100 --> 47:25.100
Thanks for being so awesome and putting up with my annoying emails.

47:25.100 --> 47:30.100
PS, you think Nintendo could reach out to the older community with games like Wii Are Old?

47:30.100 --> 47:34.100
I'd like to get some mad shuffleboard action going on.

47:34.100 --> 47:36.100
Wii Old?

47:36.100 --> 47:40.100
To give credit where credit is due, wasn't that your idea, Loki, for the gambling games on the Wii?

47:40.100 --> 47:43.100
I don't remember. I don't remember saying that. Maybe I did.

47:43.100 --> 47:45.100
No, I never said anything about gambling games.

47:45.100 --> 47:47.100
I might have been drinking. Well, I guess I did.

47:47.100 --> 47:50.100
They have a World Series of Poker Tournament Champions, but that sucks.

47:50.100 --> 47:56.100
We're talking about real money being gambled, but I think that would be a gray area that Nintendo...

47:56.100 --> 47:58.100
Technically, gambling is illegal in Japan.

47:58.100 --> 48:01.100
Well, that and that. Think about it.

48:01.100 --> 48:08.100
Usually, those online gambling sites, you associate that with shadiness.

48:08.100 --> 48:12.100
There are so many of them out there, and you always see the pop-up ads, and you go,

48:12.100 --> 48:14.100
That's a little shady to me. I don't know if I want to get it.

48:14.100 --> 48:18.100
Not to knock it if that's what you're into, but I'm sure you've done the research if you're going to spend money on it.

48:18.100 --> 48:21.100
But you have to admit, there's a lot of crap out there that seems really shady.

48:21.100 --> 48:26.100
So I wouldn't think Nintendo would want to damage their reputation with that.

48:26.100 --> 48:31.100
Now, along the lines of what you say, like clubhouse games and those types of very casual games,

48:31.100 --> 48:37.100
I think Xbox Live hit a goldmine with UNO, and I think Nintendo, if they were smart,

48:37.100 --> 48:41.100
would be quick to get out a version of clubhouse games on the Wii or something like that

48:41.100 --> 48:43.100
that kind of latches onto that where people could really do it.

48:43.100 --> 48:50.100
But at the same time, I don't know if Wii is set up for that same type of online greatness, at least in what we know.

48:50.100 --> 48:53.100
I mean, there might be unannounced things we don't know of yet, like there was on DS.

48:53.100 --> 48:57.100
We didn't know that we'd be able to talk on the DS in certain games.

48:57.100 --> 49:02.100
But Microsoft really has this rock-solid thing set up with Live,

49:02.100 --> 49:06.100
and Nintendo is being a little slow about competing with that.

49:06.100 --> 49:12.100
And the longer they take, the further ahead Microsoft's going to get ahead of them,

49:12.100 --> 49:16.100
especially with the connectivity now with the 360 and the PC.

49:16.100 --> 49:21.100
That's something that Nintendo can't do, so it's interesting.

49:21.100 --> 49:25.100
I would think Nintendo would be trying to get a little bit of a move on, trying to get online,

49:25.100 --> 49:27.100
but 2007 is going to be a big year.

49:27.100 --> 49:31.100
I think Nintendo will make a move before the year is over,

49:31.100 --> 49:35.100
and we'll really see what the full capability of their online stuff is.

49:35.100 --> 49:36.100
The next email.

49:36.100 --> 49:38.100
This is Hi, OLR.

49:38.100 --> 49:42.100
I just thought I'd add to the anecdotal evidence that the PS3 is not selling

49:42.100 --> 49:45.100
as well as Sony and the mainstream media would like you to believe.

49:45.100 --> 49:49.100
In my continuing search for the Wii, I stopped into the usual big-box stores

49:49.100 --> 49:53.100
as well as GameStop, EB Games, locations in my area fairly regularly.

49:53.100 --> 49:57.100
This Saturday morning, I got up early and made my rounds once again.

49:57.100 --> 50:00.100
At every stop on my journey, EB Games, Target, Walmart, Circuit City, Best Buy,

50:00.100 --> 50:04.100
there were PS3s to be had, but not a single Wii in sight.

50:04.100 --> 50:08.100
The Best Buy still has PS3s in stock from last week's flyer announcement.

50:08.100 --> 50:13.100
I find this quite interesting and have to believe that the way too high price point,

50:13.100 --> 50:18.100
lack of killer apps, and mounting bad press is really affecting the PS3 sales

50:18.100 --> 50:22.100
while, at least at this moment, the Wii has all the momentum necessary

50:22.100 --> 50:26.100
to sell every single unit put on the shelf, with people clamoring for more.

50:26.100 --> 50:29.100
Two other small tidbits to note from the Saturday trip.

50:29.100 --> 50:32.100
I was not the only person scavenging the stores for the Wii.

50:32.100 --> 50:37.100
At several of my stops, I saw the same early 40s lady and her mother

50:37.100 --> 50:40.100
also hoping to score an early morning Wii, pardon the pun.

50:40.100 --> 50:44.100
The other tidbit is that while I was wandering aimlessly through the Target,

50:44.100 --> 50:46.100
a woman came in and purchased an Xbox 360 system

50:46.100 --> 50:50.100
while bypassing the two 60-gigabyte PS3s on display.

50:50.100 --> 50:51.100
Sorry, Sony.

50:51.100 --> 50:53.100
Keep up the good work on the podcast.

50:53.100 --> 50:55.100
Your show is one of the two or three I look forward to every week

50:55.100 --> 50:58.100
as it makes my daily grind that much easier to bear.

50:58.100 --> 51:00.100
Thanks and take care.

51:00.100 --> 51:02.100
Austin, OLR fan.

51:02.100 --> 51:03.100
Well, thank you.

51:03.100 --> 51:06.100
Again, we kind of got into it a little bit earlier on the show.

51:06.100 --> 51:09.100
I think now that Christmas is over,

51:09.100 --> 51:12.100
I don't think the demand for the PlayStation 3 is so much there,

51:12.100 --> 51:15.100
and I think the media fear has a lot to do with that.

51:15.100 --> 51:18.100
Very interesting though, the Nintendo still going,

51:18.100 --> 51:20.100
but again, I'd be very interested to see.

51:20.100 --> 51:23.100
I think we know that Nintendo has more systems out there at this time

51:23.100 --> 51:26.100
than Nintendo or Xbox did this far out,

51:26.100 --> 51:29.100
I mean, than Sony or Microsoft did this far out after launch,

51:29.100 --> 51:33.100
but I just think it would be interesting still to see the comparison there.

51:33.100 --> 51:36.100
But I do think it is pretty obvious

51:36.100 --> 51:39.100
that Nintendo's kicking some serious booty right now,

51:39.100 --> 51:40.100
but it's price.

51:40.100 --> 51:42.100
It's all about the price.

51:42.100 --> 51:43.100
This one's a quickie.

51:43.100 --> 51:44.100
Just a random wee question.

51:44.100 --> 51:46.100
What do they call the nunchuck attachment in England?

51:46.100 --> 51:49.100
I believe it's still called the nunchuck, which I still think is a...

51:49.100 --> 51:50.100
Who is that from?

51:50.100 --> 51:51.100
Same person?

51:51.100 --> 51:52.100
No different person.

51:52.100 --> 51:53.100
Oh.

51:53.100 --> 51:54.100
It wasn't signed.

51:54.100 --> 51:55.100
Oh.

51:55.100 --> 51:58.100
I don't read out email addresses or names through email,

51:58.100 --> 52:00.100
so if it's not signed, I won't say your name.

52:00.100 --> 52:02.100
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's called the nunchuck.

52:02.100 --> 52:05.100
I think we have some UK listeners in chat.

52:05.100 --> 52:06.100
I think it's still called the nunchuck.

52:06.100 --> 52:07.100
Okay.

52:07.100 --> 52:08.100
Next one, actually.

52:08.100 --> 52:12.100
Well, it's one from someone we've already gotten an email from,

52:12.100 --> 52:14.100
but I'll go ahead and read it because it's quick.

52:14.100 --> 52:15.100
Hello, OLR.

52:15.100 --> 52:17.100
I've been an avid listener of your show ever since

52:17.100 --> 52:20.100
I heard my friends talk about it around episode 175.

52:20.100 --> 52:24.100
It's great just listening to y'all while tuning everything else out at work.

52:24.100 --> 52:26.100
Makes time go by a lot quicker.

52:26.100 --> 52:28.100
Anywho, my roommate Greg just had a thought about the Wii,

52:28.100 --> 52:30.100
and I just thought I'd share it with y'all.

52:30.100 --> 52:34.100
I hope y'all enjoy.

52:34.100 --> 52:36.100
Actually, he didn't say what the thought was.

52:36.100 --> 52:38.100
That might have been the other email.

52:38.100 --> 52:39.100
Oh.

52:39.100 --> 52:41.100
My bad.

52:41.100 --> 52:42.100
Well, all right then.

52:42.100 --> 52:43.100
Okay, I'm going to skip...

52:43.100 --> 52:44.100
Well, I will say this, though.

52:44.100 --> 52:47.100
Saisha, who left us the voicemail earlier from the UK,

52:47.100 --> 52:51.100
he's actually in chat right now and confirms it is the nunchuck.

52:51.100 --> 52:52.100
It's still called the nunchuck over there.

52:52.100 --> 52:53.100
Okay.

52:53.100 --> 52:54.100
So there you go.

52:54.100 --> 52:55.100
We've got three more to go.

52:55.100 --> 52:56.100
All right.

52:56.100 --> 53:00.100
This one comes from Necky, who's another one of our UK listeners.

53:00.100 --> 53:02.100
Hello, OLR.

53:02.100 --> 53:03.100
Once again, it's me, Necky.

53:03.100 --> 53:05.100
The New Year show was great, by the way.

53:05.100 --> 53:06.100
Thank you.

53:06.100 --> 53:07.100
It was fun.

53:07.100 --> 53:08.100
Thanks.

53:08.100 --> 53:11.100
Has anyone heard the news about the PSP Lite?

53:11.100 --> 53:16.100
It also included a link from newstechspy.com.

53:16.100 --> 53:23.100
The rest of the URL is articles06sonypsi.html.

53:23.100 --> 53:27.100
The Wii is very hard to find over here at the moment and is a right pain.

53:27.100 --> 53:33.100
I can't find any store with any in stock yet for 180 pounds.

53:33.100 --> 53:38.100
I have to say, though, I was very tempted to get an Xbox 360 after playing Saints Row

53:38.100 --> 53:39.100
yesterday.

53:39.100 --> 53:43.100
Maybe I should get a 360 now and get a Wii later when there's better games out.

53:43.100 --> 53:44.100
Your thoughts?

53:44.100 --> 53:47.100
I'm enjoying my DS at the moment and hoping to keep doing so.

53:47.100 --> 53:50.100
If you haven't already, check out Metroid Prime Hunters on DS.

53:50.100 --> 53:51.100
It's fun.

53:51.100 --> 53:52.100
Talk to you later, Necky.

53:52.100 --> 53:55.100
Thanks for the email.

53:55.100 --> 53:57.100
There was something in there I was going to say.

53:57.100 --> 53:59.100
Now I forgot because I've got sidetracked.

53:59.100 --> 54:00.100
What else did you say?

54:00.100 --> 54:02.100
Just buying a 360 now and get a Wii later?

54:02.100 --> 54:05.100
360 is a really good.

54:05.100 --> 54:09.100
Again, it all comes down to, and if you've been listening to the show for any length

54:09.100 --> 54:13.100
of time, we always say this golden rule of gaming is a system is only as good as the

54:13.100 --> 54:14.100
games that are on it.

54:14.100 --> 54:15.100
That's the golden rule of gaming.

54:15.100 --> 54:18.100
It's really about what types of games do you want to be playing right now.

54:18.100 --> 54:21.100
If you want to play Zelda, you want to play Trauma Center, you want to play WarioWare,

54:21.100 --> 54:22.100
you got to go for the Wii.

54:22.100 --> 54:26.100
If you want to be playing, you said you played Saints Row and if that was fun to you and

54:26.100 --> 54:31.100
you want to play other types of sandbox games like that that are on their way to 360 such

54:31.100 --> 54:36.100
as Grand Theft Auto later this year and some of the other Gears of War, whatever else 360

54:36.100 --> 54:42.100
has to offer, Oblivion, Pinata, whatever, maybe that's the system for you.

54:42.100 --> 54:46.100
If you're an online gamer, 360 is where it's at.

54:46.100 --> 54:50.100
If you have a soft spot in your heart for the retro classics, Wii is where it's at

54:50.100 --> 54:52.100
for the Nintendo stuff.

54:52.100 --> 54:55.100
It's really about what you want, but be careful.

54:55.100 --> 54:59.100
I know how sometimes money burns a hole in your pocket and it makes you make rash decisions

54:59.100 --> 55:04.100
and I've done this many, many times especially with game purchases, but you'll thank yourself

55:04.100 --> 55:09.100
if you take five minutes to really think about what you buy before you buy it.

55:09.100 --> 55:11.100
Second to last email.

55:11.100 --> 55:16.100
Hi guys, hope your New Year's was good and either peaceful or eventful in a good way.

55:16.100 --> 55:19.100
That's a nice way to phrase it.

55:19.100 --> 55:23.100
I had a long thought to state that considering my throat is coughing up, fur balls and other

55:23.100 --> 55:26.100
dryness, I figured just to get into it.

55:26.100 --> 55:31.100
Playing Elite Beat Agents, I've managed to get to the third difficulty level and notice something.

55:31.100 --> 55:36.100
The final songs in particular, Without a Fight and the Jumpin' Jack Flash cover, I noticed

55:36.100 --> 55:41.100
how it just matched the mood of the scenario, even getting goosebumps when the songs were being played.

55:41.100 --> 55:47.100
It got me to think about some of the boss slash climactic battles in video games over the years.

55:47.100 --> 55:50.100
How listening to the music just adds to the battle to make it more memorable.

55:50.100 --> 55:54.100
So I was wondering, what were some of your favorite songs used in boss battles?

55:54.100 --> 56:02.100
Well, that's all for now as my throat is causing me to be cloudy right now.

56:02.100 --> 56:06.100
See you guys at the chatroom and that's DDR Dollar Reel.

56:06.100 --> 56:12.100
You've actually become one of my good Doctor Who fandom buddies.

56:12.100 --> 56:19.100
I actually agree, I thought those songs fit the mood so well in Elite Beat Agents,

56:19.100 --> 56:25.100
and yet another reason why I think it is a travesty that that game is not ending up on more best of 06 lists.

56:25.100 --> 56:28.100
I think it was seriously one of the absolute best games.

56:28.100 --> 56:30.100
I'm sorry, it's better than Guitar Hero 2.

56:30.100 --> 56:32.100
It is, it really is.

56:32.100 --> 56:35.100
I guess that's my opinion, take it or leave it.

56:35.100 --> 56:41.100
I think the game is being horribly underlooked and I think people are passing off the song list

56:41.100 --> 56:43.100
without really sitting down and trying it.

56:43.100 --> 56:47.100
Because I'll tell you what, if you got turned off by the fact that it has Ashley Simpson,

56:47.100 --> 56:52.100
Lala, Avril Lavigne, Sk8er Boi, trust me, the music fits better than you're giving it credit for.

56:52.100 --> 56:54.100
So give it a try, give it a try.

56:54.100 --> 56:56.100
And yeah, those songs really fit the mood.

56:56.100 --> 56:58.100
As far as boss battles, I was going to say,

56:58.100 --> 57:02.100
Hello, Final Fantasy VII, One Winged Angel, who doesn't remember the Sephiroth?

57:02.100 --> 57:06.100
I mean, we still use that music on this program today.

57:06.100 --> 57:07.100
That's the ad that children read.

57:07.100 --> 57:09.100
That is like the epic boss battle music.

57:09.100 --> 57:14.100
I mean, yeah, this is the avid children one in particular.

57:14.100 --> 57:16.100
But, you know, who?

57:16.100 --> 57:18.100
Badass music.

57:18.100 --> 57:23.100
I remember, though, how long that took because I did the Knights of the Round Quadra Magic combo.

57:23.100 --> 57:26.100
Just casting it, going and making a sandwich, and hearing One Winged Angel in the background.

57:26.100 --> 57:28.100
It was really cool.

57:28.100 --> 57:35.100
If I want to go way old school, think about some of the 8-bit games that had some great final boss music.

57:35.100 --> 57:39.100
And I don't know, one that sticks out in my mind for whatever awkward reason,

57:39.100 --> 57:43.100
I think just one of the first songs I remember, was Remember Super Mario Bros. 2?

57:43.100 --> 57:49.100
When you finally made it to Wart, and you fought him, and it had some pretty cool final boss battle music.

57:49.100 --> 57:51.100
It was pretty cool.

57:51.100 --> 57:53.100
It sticks out in my mind for whatever reason.

57:53.100 --> 57:58.100
I also do have to say, I really...

57:58.100 --> 58:03.100
Oh, and how ironic, Junami actually just mentioned both of them.

58:03.100 --> 58:09.100
I was going to say all of the wily stage musics in the various Mega Man, Rock Man games.

58:09.100 --> 58:11.100
I was noticing that. DMN said that, too.

58:11.100 --> 58:13.100
I fully, fully agree.

58:13.100 --> 58:20.100
The first one actually was even decent, but the Mega Man games just had awesome music at any rate.

58:20.100 --> 58:32.100
There was the Jenova battle in Final Fantasy VII, too, from the first disc right after Stupid Crack Whore gets killed.

58:32.100 --> 58:40.100
I think that that was actually some pretty good music for boss battles.

58:40.100 --> 58:42.100
Our chat room is getting in the fun on this here.

58:42.100 --> 58:45.100
Shadow Charlie says, final battle music for Sonic 3.

58:45.100 --> 58:49.100
GS68 says, destination blackout from MT2.

58:49.100 --> 58:52.100
Rama says, Bowser theme from Mario Bros. 3.

58:52.100 --> 58:55.100
GS68 says, the final battle music from Final Fantasy IV.

58:55.100 --> 59:02.100
I do have to agree with the Chrono Trigger ones, just the Lavos battle.

59:02.100 --> 59:08.100
I especially love just going after you've beaten the game a few times on New Game Plus,

59:08.100 --> 59:13.100
going back and just doing it right away, and then you get the Maker's ending.

59:13.100 --> 59:16.100
Or even better, The Legend of Max.

59:16.100 --> 59:17.100
No!

59:17.100 --> 59:20.100
For DDR? Kinda. Kinda.

59:20.100 --> 59:26.100
Actually, Guitar Man, the last level music in Guitar Man was pretty hardcore.

59:26.100 --> 59:33.100
To me, those songs don't invoke that same emotional response that I think was alluded to in the email.

59:33.100 --> 59:36.100
Any more emails? One more?

59:36.100 --> 59:41.100
Yes, we do have one more email.

59:41.100 --> 59:45.100
And this one comes from Holy Shonen.

59:45.100 --> 59:52.100
Dear OLR, I'm a huge fan, have enjoyed your show greatly for the past year and a half.

59:52.100 --> 59:55.100
Just recently started being in the chat room, don't call me a noob.

59:55.100 --> 59:58.100
We call people noobs with the biggest of affections.

59:58.100 --> 01:00:02.100
No, I know, yeah. We say noob less than three.

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:05.100
Less than three, that's a heart on its side.

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:09.100
Anyway, I was wondering if you could help me with a problem I'm having.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:12.100
My desktop just died and I need a new one.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:17.100
Since my desktop would be for gaming, music, movies, etc., I was thinking of getting a PC.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:25.100
However, since I love my MacBook so much, I thought I could get a good Mac with two operating systems so that my PC-only games actually run on it.

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.100
I'm not sure I need advice. Always weird, Holy Shonen.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:32.100
P.S., Loki, I love you, but I cannot support your hatred of Mac computers.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.100
Smiley.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:36.100
Smiley, Loki, smiley.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:43.100
This is something that I was going to do, except it was a little cost prohibitive for me at this junction in my life.

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:53.100
Also, given that I have a massive library of PC-only stuff, and that, and we've got the parts sitting in my garage to actually build me a new computer.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:01:01.100
I was going to get the 24-inch widescreen iMac and dual formatted PC and Mac.

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:07.100
I did run virtual PC as well. I don't know how well it works on the new builds.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.100
What is my laptop doing?

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:13.100
For me, it's a little early for that whole dual format thing for me.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.100
It's still kind of a new technology in my mind.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.100
I'm not ready for that.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:22.100
It's the same as having Linux and Windows on the same box.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.100
I wouldn't do that to my machine.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.100
It's the same as having two different versions of Windows.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:34.100
Let me just put it this way. Me personally, I have a, I don't even know the name of my freaking little, was that an iBook, the laptop?

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.100
Yeah, you have an iBook.

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.100
I have an iBook.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.100
I have an iBook, and I just call it my Apple laptop.

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:41.100
I have an iBook, and I have a PC desktop, and I love it.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:42.100
I love that setup.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.100
I have the best of both worlds.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.100
I recommend folks do the same.

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.100
I think it's great.

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.100
It's a great combo.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:54.100
The only real reason that I was really wanting the Mac stuff myself is being a graphic artist.

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:59.100
But honestly, I've done great quality work on my PC.

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:03.100
At this point in my life, you know, it's really a matter of your preference.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:09.100
I think if you are doing graphics professionally, video editing professionally, Mac is the way to go.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:15.100
But if you're doing it for yourself or casually like me, then I don't see as much of a point in it.

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.100
I think they're great systems.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:20.100
I think it just depends on what you want to do with it.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.100
I like how much space they save.

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:26.100
I got a private message from someone that said, you know, it's just do a booting.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.100
What's the big reservation?

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:29.100
I don't know.

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.100
Maybe I'm being stupid with it, and you're right.

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:36.100
Folks do Linux and Windows and that stuff all the time, so what's the big deal?

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.100
I don't know.

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:44.100
I don't see the need to do that on my desktop to have the Mac and the PC when I have a Mac laptop.

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.100
You know what I mean?

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:52.100
If I need Apple for something, but I don't have that graphical and music need or whatever.

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:53.100
The Apples are very strong.

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.100
I don't have that need.

01:02:54.100 --> 01:03:01.100
I just like the fact that one thing I do use my Macintosh for a lot is I like author DVDs.

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:04.100
My really good friend John takes a lot of pictures, and I make DVDs out of them.

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.100
The Mac is awesome for that.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:09.100
I love it compared to anything I've tried on the PC.

01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:10.100
Little things like that.

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:14.100
I get all that out of my laptop, so I don't have the need for this whole dual boot thing.

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:17.100
To me, it's kind of a waste of resources.

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:21.100
For me, personally, I'm not criticizing anyone else that wants to do it, but I'm just saying for me.

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:24.100
Jaded in here runs four operating systems.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:29.100
Actually, what I was thinking about doing myself, because I actually want to learn Linux a little bit better.

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:34.100
When we rebuild my new computer, I'm actually going to have two-

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:41.100
My plan is to have two 20 gig hard drives in it as my boot drives, one with Linux, one with-

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:49.100
My new system's going to be- I can run Visa on it, so I'm taking out my 250 right now,

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:56.100
putting it in a USB case, which ironically, the one I'm looking at is called Metal Gear,

01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:03.100
and having that be portable between my laptop and my PC so that anything that I want, anything I need to do,

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:10.100
there it is, and 20 gig will easily store the programs I want to run.

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.100
Any more emails?

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.100
No, but this proves that we're big dorks.

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.100
I guess, a little bit.

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:21.100
All right, if you have more emails you want to send, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send them,

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:25.100
and we also offer and welcome interaction through our Skype line,

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:28.100
which will be open very soon after another little chunk of stories here.

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.100
You might want to get your Skype fired up.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:34.100
It's username Orange Lounge Radio or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:39.100
We'll let you know when those are open, but we have a couple quick final stories here for you.

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:40.100
Loki.

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:45.100
Of course, a big one, I think, this week, GameStop purchased Rhino Video Games.

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:50.100
Now, for those of you who might not be in the United States, especially on the East Coast,

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:52.100
you might not know of Rhino Video Games.

01:04:52.100 --> 01:05:00.100
They're actually a chain that's in the Southeast, and they brought a 72-store chain.

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:06.100
It's pretty large, and they were kind of competing with GameStop offering some better trade-in deals

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:12.100
and a popular two-for-one deal and trade-in to use items, get one free.

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.100
So, lots of good stuff there, but it is official.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:20.100
The Blockbuster-owned company Rhino Video Games has been bought by GameStop,

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:25.100
and this isn't really huge news, I think.

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:26.100
Well, for you it is.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:30.100
Well, for me it's not, because we've kind of known that something like this is going to happen.

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:31.100
Really?

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:35.100
Blockbuster has been entertaining offers for a while now for Rhino Video Games.

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:40.100
I know because we sell to them, so it's not a huge surprise.

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:45.100
Blockbuster is trying to kind of recover some losses and stuff,

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:52.100
and they don't really want to go focus right now on video games, mainly more movies.

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.100
Yeah, they've got Netflix to worry about.

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.100
Yeah, it's kind of a disappointment to see them being bought up,

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:02.100
because I hear they're a very good store chain.

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.100
Where do they exist mostly?

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:04.100
We don't have them here in California.

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:11.100
The southeast, no, the southern east, over north South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.100
I know Rhino.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:19.100
So, that's pretty much where they were located.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:22.100
I want to say they have like 72 locations, if I remember correctly.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:27.100
See, here in California we've always had GameStop, pretty much,

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:31.100
because previously we always had Software, etc., and Funkoland.

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.100
Bappages.

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:34.100
Yeah, they all got absolved.

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.100
I don't remember Bappages here in California.

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:41.100
Bappages, keep in mind GameStop is also owned by Barnes & Noble, Inc.

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:43.100
I think they're fully owned subsidiaries,

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:49.100
so Bappages since Bappages was Barnes & Noble's arm for games and tech.

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:53.100
The Barnes & Noble's craze, from my recollection,

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:57.100
did not really start here in this state until about ten years ago, and that whole thing.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:00.100
Those stores did not start going up until about ten years ago.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:04.100
It was always Waldenbooks, which is borders, essentially.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:08.100
Well, apparently the whole thing is supposed to go down on the 14th.

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:12.100
That's when I guess it's going to become official and they're going to start.

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:16.100
I don't know if they're going to either convert these stores over to GameStops,

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.100
which I hear that might be what's going to happen,

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:22.100
or if it's going to be like this whole GameStop, EB thing,

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:27.100
where they're still GameStop and EB, but they're owned by GameStop type thing.

01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:31.100
Kind of like Movie Gallery and Hollywood Video,

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:35.100
they're both independent, but they're owned by the same company type thing.

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.100
Interesting.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:40.100
Movie Gallery is another one we don't have out here, but they have other places.

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.100
Actually, we do.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.100
Do we?

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.100
Yes.

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:46.100
We have locally, for us, for those in the Sacramento area,

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:49.100
I think the closest one is in Placerville.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.100
Huh. That's news to me.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:54.100
Don't they rep porn at Movie Gallery?

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:55.100
I don't know.

01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:57.100
I think so, actually. I've been in a Movie Gallery.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.100
Sweet.

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:00.100
My dad used to flirt with the lady behind the counter.

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:02.100
Just go to the Video Clearance Center.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.100
They have tons of porn there.

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:06.100
In fact, they carry more porn than, I think, actual videos now.

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:09.100
They actually said, I went into one and they said they had a green door

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:11.100
that you could go behind to buy the porn.

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.100
They actually had to paint their door.

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:15.100
Paint it green?

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:18.100
Somebody raised a stink and they had to paint over the green door.

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:20.100
With what?

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.100
I think it's purple now.

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.100
Okay, so now it's a purple door.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.100
What's it?

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.100
Go behind the green door to buy it.

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:28.100
Never mind.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.100
Okay.

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:30.100
Anyway, forget it.

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:33.100
Look.

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:37.100
This is so horrible that we have to follow up that topic with this,

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.100
but it's just the way it was scripted, folks.

01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:41.100
Let's talk about charity.

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:43.100
We'll go to the opposite end of the spectrum,

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.100
from buying porn to donating to charity.

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:49.100
Of course, one charity a lot of gamers know about

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.100
is Penny Arcade's Child Play charity,

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:56.100
and they raised over $1 million this year.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:09:00.100
It was posted on the Child's Play website this week that,

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.100
quote, you guys did it.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.100
You broke $1 million in just over two months.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:06.100
Child's Play started as a way to show how good our community can be,

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.100
but it's turned into something greater than we could have ever imagined.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.100
We're making an impact on lives.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.100
See you next year.

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:15.100
They're at $1,024,400.

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:16.100
That's great.

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.100
That's awesome.

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.100
Congratulations.

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.100
I think it's a damn shame the media won't ever cover that.

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:24.100
In the same capacity that they cover, I should say,

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:27.100
because I'm sure they get a nice story here and there,

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:32.100
but in the same way that Game Boy Electrocute Small Child,

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:35.100
kids go and shoot up their schools because of video games,

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:37.100
it's never going to get the same.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:41.100
That documentary, not really a documentary,

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:46.100
but that documentary on video game violence called Moral Combat,

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:53.100
I think you'd find better quality behind the beaded doors in a movie gallery.

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.100
Behind the purple door.

01:09:55.100 --> 01:10:00.100
At any rate, speaking of quality, and I vote this for quality,

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:07.100
Guitar Hero 2 360 is going to have additional content.

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:10.100
They're not really saying much about it.

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:14.100
Rumor has it that it might be new modes, downloadable content,

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:18.100
probably for new songs coming out, sort of like how Karaoke Revolution goes.

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:25.100
Putting out the original Guitar Hero songs with extra bass or rhythm guitar,

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.100
I think that'd be pretty cool.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:31.100
And it does say though, right on the box,

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:36.100
that there are additional songs and downloadable content.

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.100
Sweet.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.100
I know there was a reason I was holding out for this game on the 360,

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.100
and this is exactly why.

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:47.100
And yes, I do realize I was saying things that may seem a little anti-Guitar Hero

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:49.100
earlier in the show, but I'm really not.

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.100
I really do like Guitar Hero a lot.

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:53.100
I just don't think it's God's gift to gaming.

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:57.100
I think there were better games that came out in 06 and so on.

01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.100
But I've been holding out to buy this.

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.100
I've played it on PS2, and sure, it's fun,

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:04.100
but I've been holding out for 360, and I knew that this was why.

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.100
I'm also going to link in the chat room,

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:13.100
though there is a picture of this up on a Team Xbox site

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:17.100
that has what the box art is.

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.100
So I'm posting that right now.

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:24.100
The box art was very interesting looking to me, I have to say.

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.100
But very cool, I liked it.

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:27.100
I'm looking forward to it.

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.100
You know I'm going to get it anyway.

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.100
I know you will.

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.100
All right.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:34.100
We are going to open up our Skype line over at orangelaundry.com.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:36.100
Click on interact with us for more details,

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.100
but I'll give you some of the low down right now.

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.100
It's Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:43.100
Or you can give us a call over the traditional telephone.

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:46.100
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:51.100
That's 1-877-GAME-OLR, and that's toll free in the United States and Canada.

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:54.100
International listeners, you may want to look into the Skype thing

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:58.100
because they will charge your ass if you use the telephone.

01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:59.100
Let's go to the phones.

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.100
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:02.100
Who's this?

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.100
It's Nim.

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.100
Oh, Nim.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.100
Hi, Nim.

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.100
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:07.100
Not much, really.

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:09.100
I didn't expect to get it through.

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.100
Well, you did.

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:12.100
You don't have anything you want to share with us tonight?

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.100
Why did you call?

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:16.100
Oh, yeah.

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:20.100
I was making a kibi.

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:21.100
You were making what?

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.100
The computer.

01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:25.100
You were making what?

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.100
A new game.

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:29.100
Oh, you're the one that messaged Loki earlier

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.100
and said you're making this game called kibi.

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:32.100
Yeah.

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.100
What is this all about?

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:41.100
Well, it's going to run off of a modified version of StepMania.

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:47.100
A couple of the OLR mates are going to help us with it.

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:49.100
And, yeah, that's pretty much all we're doing.

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:51.100
We're looking for artists and such.

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:55.100
Have you made a post in our forums about it?

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.100
No.

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:58.100
Right now it's pretty much underground.

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.100
Well, now you just outed it to all the folks that listen to the program.

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.100
So go post on the forums.

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:04.100
I'm sure you can get some help.

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:05.100
And good luck to you on the project.

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:07.100
All right.

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:10.100
So it's supposed to be a BeatMania-ish game,

01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:15.100
but with DDR's interface?

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.100
Turn down your radio.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.100
Hold on a second.

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.100
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.100
See, I could hear myself in the background.

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:21.100
Turn down the radio.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.100
When you call radio programs, turn down the radio.

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:25.100
Have you seen Death Metal Force, Rob?

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:27.100
That's because I love Guar.

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:28.100
Damn headphones.

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.100
All right, no, that's right.

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:33.100
So anyway, what was I going to say?

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.100
So this is what DDR...

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:38.100
It's based on a DDR interface, but it's BeatMania.

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:42.100
Yeah, have you seen the videos of StepMania?

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:45.100
Yeah, and I always thought...

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:50.100
99% of people who play StepMania are just doing finger-finger revolution.

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:53.100
Very few people are actually hooking up dance pads at the computer.

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:55.100
So I think it's a good idea.

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:59.100
To make something that's actually not pretending to be actual dancing.

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:00.100
Yeah, I know.

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.100
That's the point.

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.100
Great!

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.100
Then I fully support this project.

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:04.100
Yeah.

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.100
All right.

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.100
I'll draw you a picture.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.100
Good luck to you.

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.100
I'll do announcer packs if you need it.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.100
All right.

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.100
Thanks, guys.

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.100
All right, no problem.

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.100
Good luck with your project.

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:17.100
And keep us informed on the forums or whatever, all right?

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:21.100
All right, well, I guess he hung up.

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:29.100
If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:30.100
Let's go to the phones.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:31.100
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.100
Who's this?

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.100
This is Paradox Vincent.

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.100
Hi, Paradox Vincent.

01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:38.100
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:47.100
Well, I was picking my friend up a game at GameStop recently, and they had a Game Informer

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:51.100
and a display, so I picked it up and I flipped through the reviews.

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:55.100
I thought they gave Wii Sports a 6.5 out of 5.

01:14:55.100 --> 01:15:00.100
Wait, they gave Wii Sports a 6.5 out of 5?

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:01.100
Yeah.

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:04.100
Is that a typo or something?

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.100
No.

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:10.100
How do you give a game a 6.5 out of 5?

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.100
Do I think they gave it one?

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.100
Yeah.

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:17.100
I think they gave it one because it's not like Gears of War.

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:25.100
It's not this hyper polished first person shooter that takes years upon years to make.

01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:27.100
It's just a simple little sports game.

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:31.100
You meant to say 6.5 out of 10, right?

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:32.100
Yeah.

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.100
Okay, there it is.

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.100
Okay, so I was thinking, what, 6.5 out of 5?

01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:39.100
Are they giving it multiple scores because there's four or five games in it?

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.100
Okay, so they gave it 6.5 out of 10.

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.100
Okay, now I got you.

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:49.100
So they gave it a bit of a lower score because it's not a pretty game, I suppose is what

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.100
you're saying.

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:56.100
Yeah, but the thing is that every single person that I've showed this game to, they've absolutely

01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:57.100
loved it.

01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:06.100
She was an older woman, a middle aged woman, come up to my mom and says, hey, have you

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:10.100
checked out Wii Bowling?

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:19.100
And for someone of that age to come up to another woman of a similar age and discuss

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:24.100
a video game with them, I think Nintendo's done exactly what they wanted to do in the

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:25.100
first place.

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:28.100
Yeah, it's like you're living in Bizarro World for a minute when your parents are the ones

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:29.100
talking about games.

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:31.100
Let me quote the review real quick.

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:37.100
Their basic breakdown of this, this is a concept, an uneven intro into the system and its controllers,

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.100
but at least it's free.

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:42.900
Graphics, they say the game uses Mii avatars on your Wii, but that's about the only eye

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.900
catching thing about it.

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:48.580
The tiny sound that comes from the Wii remote really starting to bug me.

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:53.420
It says playability, sometimes there are inconsistencies between your movement and what happens on

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:54.420
screen.

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:58.700
Entertainment, this is a shallow game by design, but it does offer some occasional fun.

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:02.100
Replay moderately low, which I don't really agree with.

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:07.700
Yeah, and you know what, look, gosh, I'm going into rant mode here in a minute, hold

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:08.700
on.

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:09.700
All right.

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:15.900
The gaming media as it stands today is in for a rude awakening because of what Nintendo

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:16.900
is doing here.

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:21.300
I mean, look at the way that most critics really dog the hell out of Excite Truck.

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.380
Yet, again, it's the same thing.

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:27.020
We showed this game to non-gamers and they love it.

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:31.180
For people that have been playing games a while, yeah, Burnout's a prettier game.

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:35.960
Yeah, Test Drive Unlimited was a really revolutionary game with its online system and these games

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:39.680
were fantastic, but Excite Truck kept it simple.

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:43.420
People picked up this thing and just went and loved it and loved the control and loved

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:46.540
being able to move the control.

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:50.780
You remember back in the day if you ever let a non-gamer or even some regular gamers would

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:55.660
play an old 8-bit game, they'd move their body with the controller and when they jumped

01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:57.820
they'd pull back and all that stuff.

01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:02.260
Nintendo made that a part of the game.

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:05.620
When they said they were going new generation, they meant it.

01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:08.860
That's why I think a lot of people that have been in this line of thinking for a while

01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:11.760
are going to be in for Rude Awakening pretty soon.

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.860
Nintendo is not making games necessarily for the hardcore gamer.

01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:15.860
So you know what?

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:20.620
I urge you guys out there who read a lot of these reviews, and it's not just this particular

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:23.160
one, but think about all these stories we've had lately.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.940
We had EGM Bash Elibits when a lot of folks feel it didn't need it.

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:32.380
We had GameSpot, heaven forbid, didn't give Zelda a 9 or a 10 and they received the wrath

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.420
of Nintendo fanboys everywhere.

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:40.860
I think it is very interesting that the common theme here is all Nintendo Wii games.

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:46.620
The other thing too is people need to understand these are critics.

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:54.900
Here's a website I recommend checking out, metacritic.com.

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.500
Definitely check it out because they break down.

01:18:56.500 --> 01:19:02.300
They have a list of all the scores at different magazines and websites and whatnot published.

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.820
We don't have anything on here.

01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:07.980
They also, but it does give an average and it also has user averages.

01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:12.460
That's a really good place to look, especially if you're wondering if a game is good or not.

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:16.020
Don't read one magazine or a couple of magazines because certain people have certain tastes

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:17.020
in magazines.

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.340
For example, if I were rating a sports game, I'd probably give it a little score because

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:21.460
I hate sports games.

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:26.240
That's not fair, but unfortunately, there are biased reviews out there.

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:29.660
That's why you need websites like this or just to kind of...

01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:30.660
Awesome.

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:31.660
Well, here it is.

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:32.660
You're already doing the right thing.

01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:38.220
You found an internet podcast with gamers who probably game somewhat similarly to you.

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:42.100
A lot of the people who wrote us and said that they appreciated our opinions and things

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:46.540
like that were gamers that play a lot of the similar games we do.

01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:47.800
Maybe you disagree with us.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.180
Maybe you listen to the top 10 list.

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:52.060
Loki and I and Dark Soccer said earlier in the show and you're like, God, they're full

01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:53.060
of crap.

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:57.020
Well, then go out and find another one of the hundreds of video game podcasts that are

01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:01.740
out there being produced by independent gamers like you and me that have similar tastes.

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:05.460
I think that is where things are headed and that's why I say that the traditional gaming

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:08.380
press is in for a rude awakening very soon.

01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:09.860
Oh, yeah.

01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:11.420
All right.

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:12.580
Any other thoughts?

01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:13.820
I've been dominating the conversation.

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:14.820
I apologize.

01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:17.820
What do you think, buddy?

01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:18.820
I agree with you.

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:26.120
I think that if they are in for a rude awakening, I'm really welcoming that because up until

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:31.700
now, it's kind of been viewed... I mean, gaming has been viewed as a very nerd culture.

01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:38.620
I think that just being able to interact with something that's on TV isn't evil.

01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:41.700
It's not obscure.

01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:48.420
It's pretty natural for me, so I think that if somebody can just sit down and have fun

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:55.460
with a game, then I think that's exactly what Nintendo wants them to do and that's exactly

01:20:55.460 --> 01:21:00.020
what I think they are going to and I'm hoping they're going to achieve.

01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:04.580
Out of curiosity, outside of Nintendo Power, can anyone, whether on the phone or here in

01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:09.740
the room, think of... Is there a magazine out there geared towards the casual gamer?

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:10.740
No.

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:14.620
I'm not necessarily saying that Nintendo Power is like that magazine, but you know what I

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:15.620
mean?

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:20.100
Like something that would maybe give the Wii game reviews the perspective that the big

01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:22.280
boys are missing out on?

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.220
Is there any type of publication like that right now?

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:25.660
Not that I know of.

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:26.660
Maybe there ought to be.

01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:27.660
Specifically the gaming.

01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:28.660
I don't know.

01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:32.460
Maybe they figured that because they're casual gamers, they wouldn't want to buy magazines

01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.460
about gaming.

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.460
I don't know.

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.460
Just kind of wondering.

01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:37.540
Well, maybe you need to look at reviews.

01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:41.420
If you want to look at what casual gamers think, you need to look at game reviews as

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:47.700
a subsection of bigger magazines like the game reviews in Entertainment Weekly or the

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:52.580
game reviews in Time and Newsweek and that's why I find it very fascinating that you have

01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:55.140
magazines like Time and Newsweek or whichever one of those.

01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:56.140
Forbes.

01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:57.220
Wii Sports, the game of the year.

01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:58.220
I don't know.

01:21:58.220 --> 01:21:59.220
It's just fascinating.

01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:03.940
But then again, for a casual gamer, just like he said, grandma's talking to grandma about

01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:04.940
Wii bowling.

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:09.420
Yeah, but see, these people are also going to say, oh, the Wii is the best system in

01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:13.880
the fucking world because you swing around in the game and it's more interactive.

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.220
That's not a really informed decision.

01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:22.100
That's just, I see something different, ooh, shiny.

01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:23.100
I don't know.

01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:26.580
It's just kind of on the other end of the spectrum instead of having someone that's

01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:30.700
really hardcore into a game, you have someone reviewing a game that knows jack shit about

01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:36.620
games and they're reviewing it just because Nintendo told them it's an awesome game, oh,

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:37.620
it's an awesome game.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.620
So, I don't know.

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:40.620
All right.

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:44.260
Well, any other thoughts you want to share with our listeners, Paradox Vincent?

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:46.780
Trauma Center is amazing.

01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:47.780
It is.

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:48.780
It is great.

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:52.060
Horribly under looked and if you own a Wii, you owe it to yourself to at least rent this

01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:54.500
damn game and check it out.

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.780
I think it's pretty.

01:22:56.780 --> 01:23:02.500
I mean, I'm spoiled by the 360s graphics and you know what little I've seen of the PlayStation

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:03.500
3.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:07.340
The graphics in Trauma Center, not that thrilling, but that's not the point.

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:09.340
That's not the point of Trauma Center.

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:11.040
Oh, yeah.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.100
And I think I'm not surprised.

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:16.360
Once again, I'm sure the mainstream gaming press kind of missed that, but the game is

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.700
more fun than a lot of games I've played in a long time.

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:21.500
Anyway, we got to let you go, Paradox Vincent, so we can take other calls, but thanks so

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:25.580
much for inspiring the lively chat we've had here.

01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:26.580
All right.

01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:27.580
Just saying.

01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:28.580
All right.

01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:29.580
Take care, buddy.

01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:30.580
You too.

01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:31.580
Bye-bye.

01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:33.380
Let's go to another phone call, shall we?

01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:36.380
Let's go to this call.

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:37.940
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:39.100
Who's this?

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:40.100
This is DMN.

01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:41.100
Oh, boy.

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:42.100
You always...

01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:43.100
Hi.

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:44.100
You always manage to get through.

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:45.100
Hi.

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:47.100
When are you coming to visit me again?

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:48.100
May.

01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:49.100
Okay.

01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:50.940
Yeah, they're planning.

01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:54.900
The rest of OLR's contributors are planning something big for the fifth anniversary of

01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:58.980
OLR, which, by the way, I forgot to say this at the top of the show, but this episode would

01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:02.300
mark our third year of podcasting, or our third birthday.

01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.300
Yay.

01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:04.300
Yay.

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.300
Whatever.

01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:06.300
Okay.

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:07.300
Great.

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:08.300
And then we were forced to eat Rob's shoes.

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.060
You can only celebrate so many landmark shows.

01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:11.060
So anyway, whatever.

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:12.700
DMN, what's on your mind tonight?

01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:13.700
Two things.

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:16.980
It was one, but that previous call fired up some other things.

01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:19.380
One, I'm disappointed in the three of you.

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:20.380
Why?

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.380
I didn't do it.

01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:22.380
You did, Jamie.

01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:23.380
No.

01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:27.340
I did not hear Okami out of any one of you three.

01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:29.900
I didn't play Okami.

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:30.900
Interesting, huh?

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:36.460
I think it's because PS2 games, late generation PS2 games, are being horribly overlooked in

01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:41.980
this last push towards the next gen of gaming, and yeah, I guess I'm a little bit guilty

01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:42.980
of that.

01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:46.540
But again, it's kind of one of those cases where if I had more, if I had a top 20 or

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:49.540
a top 15, probably Okami would have made it.

01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:53.340
Or even, it could have been my number 10, but I had to say Sneaking.

01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:54.340
I had to.

01:24:54.340 --> 01:25:00.500
Well, yeah, but I mean, for one, Okami was my game of the year, if anybody was an SDFU.

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:01.500
All three of you.

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:02.500
No, we don't listen to it.

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:03.500
Ok.

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:09.260
Okami was my game of the year, and I was surprised that none of you guys said it.

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:10.580
So you guys saw it.

01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:11.580
I didn't play it.

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:14.940
And there's probably 500 other people out there listening going, why didn't they rank

01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:15.940
this game higher?

01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:17.580
Why didn't they put this game on the list?

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:18.580
Why not this?

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:19.580
Why not that?

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:20.580
You know what?

01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:24.220
That's the whole point of Top List, is it's just one opinion and take it or leave it.

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:25.220
Yeah.

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:27.500
I'm not saying Okami's a bad game by any means.

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.180
It's fantastic, but you know.

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:31.660
Ok, good, because if you said it's a bad game, I'd punch you in the face.

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:32.660
No, I don't feel that way at all.

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:35.300
That means you'd have to come here to do it, and I'd have to catch it on film.

01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:36.300
I didn't.

01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.300
Exactly.

01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:38.300
I did not get it.

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.580
Well, I left Gears of War off my top 10, and Gears of War wouldn't even be in my top 20.

01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:42.580
But that's just me personally.

01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:45.240
I was severely disappointed by Gears of War.

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.900
Go back and listen to me supporting Michelle from Video Game Outsiders in last week's episode.

01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:52.500
She felt the same way I did.

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.060
It wasn't all that.

01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:56.140
It was pretty, and that's it.

01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:57.220
To me.

01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:59.260
But anyway.

01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:03.620
Number two is Nintendo Power for about the past year hasn't really been catered toward

01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.620
the casual gamer.

01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:07.700
They've changed their outlook on things.

01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:11.460
I wasn't trying to say Nintendo Power was a casual gamer's magazine, but I was trying

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:18.460
to think, what magazine is reviewing Wii games from the perspective of, I am not a hardcore

01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.460
gamer.

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:22.620
I'm someone who just likes to have fun.

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:24.980
What gaming magazine could Nelly read?

01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:25.980
None of them.

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:26.980
None of them.

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:27.980
I'll tell you why.

01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:29.900
First of all, you see shitty games.

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:36.020
I could bring up a big example several years back, a game for the PS2 called State of Emergency.

01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:39.520
This game was hyped as hell.

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:43.840
This is when I knew one of my favorite magazines, Jump the Shark, EGM, I believe they gave the

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:50.460
game an 8.5, and it was one of the worst games I've ever played.

01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:57.260
It started making me think that I think some of those developers pay off magazines to give

01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:02.620
their games good reviews, and if that is the case, I'm very sorely disappointed in gaming

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:03.620
media.

01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:05.820
Look at Atari and Driver 3, that's what they did.

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:14.040
I'm not going to go there because I don't have the proof to back it up, but it's a very

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:20.900
interesting industry because you take the passion that movie fans have about movies,

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:24.840
go to those big movie websites like Ain't It Cool News, just read the passion that people

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:31.900
have for movies, multiply that by 100, and you have the gaming fans and the games.

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:37.500
It's something else, and the gaming fans will respond appropriately, I think.

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.340
I don't think gaming fans are stupid.

01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:48.060
Look at what happened with All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com, case in point.

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:50.900
You could also put the Halo franchise in that same limelight.

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:56.820
I don't think that they're 10 out of 10s as what a lot of magazines gave Halo 1 and some

01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:58.940
gave Halo 2 when it came out.

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:05.020
I think they're decent, but they're not industry-changing games.

01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:08.140
What's funny with that, I would actually disagree, I do think Halo 2 is a 10 out of 10 game,

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:10.300
but that's just me.

01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:17.460
I do think it's an industry-changing game, but that's, again, its opinion.

01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:18.460
But that's about it.

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:19.460
All right.

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:23.100
Well, DMN, so you're going to have the guy from VG Cats on your show on Thursday, we

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:24.100
hope?

01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:26.220
Either this or next week, that's what we're shooting for.

01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:28.100
How are you landing all these big interviews?

01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:33.220
You just smoothing, writing nice e-mails and all that stuff?

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:36.220
How much dick are you having to suck, I guess is what I'm asking.

01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:38.820
Well, you taught me, so...

01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:40.620
Oh, okay.

01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:45.440
Yet I must have taught you better than myself because we're not landing any of these big

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.140
interviews, but you are, so no.

01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:48.140
That's cool.

01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:49.140
We love VG Cats.

01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:50.140
I'm looking forward to hearing that episode.

01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:52.180
Tell them that they're my favorite webcomic ever.

01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:55.900
I'm sure he's going to take the time to point that out.

01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:59.020
The chick on OLR loves you.

01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:03.380
All right, DMN.

01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:04.380
Have a good time.

01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:05.740
We're going to try to get another call before we leave.

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:06.740
All right.

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:07.740
Have a good one.

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:08.740
Take care, guys.

01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:09.740
Bye.

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:10.740
Bye.

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:17.380
If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or the Skype line is Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:20.660
Let's try at least one more call here, maybe more if we're feeling saucy.

01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:23.100
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:24.100
Who's this?

01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.100
Raven's Dolphin.

01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:26.100
Hi, Raven's Dolphin.

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:28.220
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:34.340
I just want to say that Microsoft did not give early adopters the shaft.

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:35.620
They did not give who the shaft?

01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:36.620
Early adopters.

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:37.620
Oh, early adopters.

01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:38.620
Early adopters.

01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:39.620
Okay.

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:40.620
Why not?

01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:45.700
Because they did not introduce the HDMI port for the Xbox 360 XS.

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:52.180
Oh, so you're saying that you've been following the keynote tonight and they did not, in fact,

01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:54.020
introduce the HDMI port today?

01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:55.020
No.

01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:56.020
No.

01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:57.020
They didn't.

01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:58.020
They didn't even say HDMI.

01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:01.700
They just went like, okay, this is the Xbox 360 IPTV.

01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:02.700
This is what you can do with it.

01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:03.700
This is Uno.

01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:04.700
Now you can play Uno on the road.

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:05.700
You can play Uno here.

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:06.700
You can play Uno there.

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:09.020
You can even play this there.

01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:10.900
So are you saying this story is bullshit?

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:11.900
Oh, yeah.

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:15.020
I'm saying it's super bullshit now.

01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:17.540
I don't know if it's coming later.

01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:21.260
I'm keeping my mind open to it.

01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:22.260
You know what?

01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:28.340
The gadget story in the subsequent YouTube video, pretty daunting evidence.

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:32.220
I think there would be a future Xbox that has these add-ons.

01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:35.980
I think maybe now is just not the time for Microsoft to want to be announcing that.

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:41.100
I think they're still trying to move 360s in the wake of a competitive battle with PlayStation

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:42.100
3 and Wii.

01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:45.100
I think maybe now is just not the time they want to announce it, but I think by summer

01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:46.100
they will.

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:51.660
One more thing I want to tell you about that HDMI hookup in the back of the 360.

01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:52.660
I ran through VGA.

01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:56.460
They opened it up through VGA through the TV.

01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:57.460
True.

01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:58.460
They do.

01:30:58.460 --> 01:30:59.460
Well, we'll see.

01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:00.460
We'll see.

01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:01.460
No.

01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:02.460
Okay.

01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:07.340
I just want to say they didn't give me the shot, and I am now trying to get money up

01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:08.980
for Windows Vista.

01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:12.060
Well, good luck.

01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:13.060
I know.

01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:14.060
You're right.

01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:15.060
All right.

01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:16.060
Take care, buddy.

01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:17.060
You too.

01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:18.060
Bye.

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:19.060
See ya.

01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:21.620
Boy, some people get through every week, but that's okay.

01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:22.620
Okay.

01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:23.620
We do love our regular listeners.

01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:24.620
One more call.

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:25.620
Hi.

01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:26.620
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:27.620
Who's this?

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:28.620
Hello?

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:29.620
Hi.

01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:30.620
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:31.620
Who's this?

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:32.620
This is DDR Dollar Bill.

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:33.620
Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.

01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:34.620
What's on your mind?

01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:35.620
Oh, not much.

01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:41.180
Just trying to call and say hi and what's up, and I do have a question, though.

01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:42.180
Okay.

01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:47.980
I haven't heard you guys talk too much about portables, like DS games, except like Cooking

01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:49.980
Mama.

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:50.980
That would be me.

01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:51.980
Yeah?

01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:52.980
Yeah.

01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:54.540
My favorite game, too, by the way.

01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:56.620
So what were you hoping that we would be talking about?

01:31:56.620 --> 01:31:57.620
I don't know.

01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:01.500
It was like, because I just started Hating Guys November, and one of the games I wasn't

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:05.780
sure if you guys talked about was in the Castlevania series.

01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:09.860
You know what's funny is that we got, the last time I actually played the Castlevania

01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:13.340
game, I do still need to pick up the new one on DS, but we did get to play it in August

01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:15.740
at the little Konami thing we went to.

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:21.740
I really enjoyed it, more than the previous DS games, I get all the names confused.

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:22.740
Dawn of Sorrow?

01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:23.740
Is that it?

01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:24.740
Dawn of Sorrow?

01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:25.740
Yeah, Dawn of Sorrow is the last one.

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:26.740
And this new one, Portrait of Ruin.

01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:27.740
Portrait of Ruin I liked quite a bit.

01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:31.300
I liked the whole fact that you had kind of the two characters, and I liked the fact that

01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:33.820
you kind of went outside the castle into other worlds.

01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:37.660
It felt a little more like Simon's Quest, I suppose, in that regard.

01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:40.140
Or Mario 64, where you jump into the paintings.

01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:41.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:42.760
Kind of like that, yeah.

01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:44.220
So yeah, no, it was pretty cool.

01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:46.840
I do want to check out the final release of the game, although I'm pretty sure what we

01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:49.020
played in August was pretty close to final.

01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:54.060
Yeah, I've been playing for a while, it's really good.

01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:56.260
I've never seen a fast...

01:32:56.260 --> 01:33:01.100
What was the other game we played that Kojima was behind on the DS?

01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:02.100
Yeah, that hasn't come out yet.

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:03.100
I can't remember the name of it.

01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:04.100
What was that like, Mark?

01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:05.100
I don't know.

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.100
Damn it.

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:07.100
That was pretty decent.

01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:08.100
Lunar Nights.

01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:09.100
Lunar Nights, thank you.

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:10.100
That was pretty decent, I liked that.

01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:11.100
Which one was it?

01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:12.620
Lunar Nights was pretty fun.

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:15.340
It's the sequel to Boktai, I believe.

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:16.340
Oh really?

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:17.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:21.300
It really reminded me of Boktai, but without that stupid chip in the cart, you don't actually

01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:24.300
have to be out in the sun, which did not work for me on the advance.

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.600
I'm going to take a shot.

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.880
And I've been sinking a lot of hours lately into Elite Beat Agents, which I think I've

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:34.860
been showering love and adoration on on this program, and Final Fantasy III on the DS.

01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:36.300
You know what I'm excited about?

01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:39.500
The Warriors is coming out on the PSP at the end of the month.

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:43.700
And I was going to say, PSP-wise, I don't know if you're gaming on that, but some games

01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:46.380
I've said previously to check out.

01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:51.300
Luminous 2, very good if you haven't played Luminous on live, or especially the first

01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:52.300
one.

01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.500
Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.

01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:57.140
The Gradius Collection and those other retro titles are great.

01:33:57.140 --> 01:34:04.900
Was it the Twinvee Collection, which is coming out, and the Salamander Collection, and of

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:11.780
course, for Game Boy Advance Final Fantasy VI, first week in February there, Diddy Kong

01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:14.100
Racing for the DS.

01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:17.340
We love our handhelds, it's just the past couple months have been mostly the systems

01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:18.340
for me.

01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:19.340
The consoles, I should say.

01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:25.620
Yeah, just, hmm, Warriors on the PSP, I hope it plays like the Xbox and PS2 versions.

01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:27.180
Oh, we'll see.

01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:32.060
Yeah, I hope so, because I tried Luminous, but you said, and on the phone, actually.

01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:33.060
Oh.

01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:34.060
On the cell phone.

01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:38.140
I couldn't really hear the music, but the gameplay was actually addicting.

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:43.340
Yeah, I mean, remember that on an actual system it's gonna look so much better, and yeah,

01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:46.180
if you thought the gameplay was addicting on the phone, wait till you play it.

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:48.100
I think Luminous is a fantastic game.

01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:53.020
I didn't put Luminous 2 in my top 10 of the year, because unfortunately I felt it didn't

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:59.220
really add enough, especially when you consider the mobile really took some risks with the

01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:00.220
gameplay.

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:04.260
I felt that Luminous 2 was a little too much more of the same for it to be justified on

01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:07.860
the top 10 of the year, but it definitely was a very solid release, and if you have

01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:12.860
not played Luminous at all, then it's okay to skip Luminous 1 and go right to 2, because

01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:18.300
it does have some added things, and I think the additional skins in the music videos were

01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:19.300
very cool.

01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:21.380
Oh, that was the other reason why Luminous 2 lost a lot of brownie points with me, is

01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:24.220
because they recycled way too much for Luminous 1.

01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:28.980
So pretty much Luminous 2 is like Luminous 1 plus Unstuffed, then?

01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:34.540
Yeah, but way more stuff, and if you don't have a PSP at all, you should get the Xbox

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:38.980
Live one, but I don't think you need both, unless you're really a puzzle game whore like

01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:39.980
I am.

01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:44.780
Well, not as much for me, but the 360 I'll get later.

01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:51.140
I'm eagerly hoping that the music artist pack and the Heavenly Stars song is out very, very

01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:52.140
soon.

01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:54.140
It was supposed to be in January at some point, so we'll see.

01:35:54.140 --> 01:36:00.180
Yeah, it'll be a while for me to get it, because of money and all that.

01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:04.300
Any other thoughts for our listeners, DDR dollar bill?

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:08.380
I had a few, but I'm just still a little sick right now, so I just wanted to chime in about

01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:11.720
the portables, because I never hear you guys talk about it.

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:14.220
We try to give it a little love once in a while, we do love our portables, I love my

01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:17.540
DS, and my PSP for certain things.

01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:18.540
Same here.

01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:19.540
All right.

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:20.540
Well, thanks so much for the call, buddy.

01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:21.540
Keep listening.

01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:22.540
See you, guys.

01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:23.540
All right, see you.

01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:24.540
Bye-bye.

01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:25.540
Bye-bye.

01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:28.780
Ah, those were some good calls tonight.

01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:31.340
Little rough starts to some of them, but we got our way through them.

01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:34.260
So thank you guys so much for calling in tonight, we're going to go ahead and close the Skype

01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:35.260
line.

01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:39.020
Sorry to those that didn't get through, but we still love you, we're almost to two hours

01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:40.960
for this segment, so we've got to wrap this crap up.

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.500
Any last minute stories, you guys?

01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:43.500
Yes.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:44.500
Okay.

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:50.020
Necronasia is coming to the United States as a game called Escape from Bug Island, and

01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:52.580
let me tell you this much, the game is as crappy as that new title.

01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:57.180
So don't pick it up when it comes out, it's shit.

01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:01.700
But Eidos is producing it, so that won't be the first time that their games suck.

01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:02.700
Let's see here.

01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:08.260
Then, of course, there was some news also coming from CES about Vista, and this isn't

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:13.340
really a huge surprise, that the Xbox 360 controller is going to be able to be used

01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:14.340
with Vista.

01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:20.940
In fact, it's going to be kind of like a standard for them, so, duh, big, huge surprise there.

01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:25.500
What is kind of cool, though, is this Thursday, January 11th, there's going to be new content

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:32.220
for Gears of War coming out, including two free maps, Raven Down, which is going to be

01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:40.020
a map set around a downed Raven helicopter, and it looks pretty, and there's also a new

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:45.820
map called Old Bones, which looks like a museum, which looks pretty cool.

01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:50.140
Both those are going to be free because they're being sponsored by, and this is weird, the

01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:52.020
Discovery Channel.

01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:55.420
They're also giving away two million Microsoft points.

01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:59.100
Doesn't Discovery HD, though, have a game special that's been airing or something?

01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:00.100
I don't know.

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:01.100
I think so.

01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:02.100
It makes a little sense to me.

01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:05.180
So that's kind of cool, I guess.

01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:06.540
Pretty cool.

01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:10.780
And also there's a rumor that Nintendo is developing a wireless nunchuck already.

01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:11.780
Interesting.

01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:15.900
They need a wireless old school controller, a classic controller.

01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:16.900
Classic controller.

01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:19.260
Well, if they do the nunchuck, they can do the classic controller, I guess.

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:20.260
They will.

01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:23.540
Dark Saga, do you have anything?

01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:24.540
No.

01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:25.540
All right.

01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:27.380
Then that brings our show to a close.

01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:31.100
Thanks again so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio, you guys.

01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.260
Just a reminder, we're not live next week.

01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:37.420
I'm sorry, live listeners, but we just have personal situations to be dealt with, and

01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:41.460
that would include I'm finally going to Disneyland with the girls, so we'll take lots of pictures

01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:47.300
and share that with you guys in the fan communities, and Loki has that other thing, which I'm just

01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:51.340
now finding out about, and I really wish I could go to that, so please give those two,

01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:56.620
my old Final Fantasy XI buddies, give them my best, and best wishes and all that stuff.

01:38:56.620 --> 01:39:01.020
And we will still have a new audio blog or podcast, whatever you want to call it.

01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:04.020
There will still be a new show that way, so apologies to live listeners.

01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:08.180
I know you've had to deal with a break, but we promise after this week, we won't be having

01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:13.440
a break for a long time, a long time, so if you bear with us, we'll be good.

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:16.220
So thank you guys so much for your continued support of our program.

01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:20.780
You guys are awesome, and we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:22.500
Loki, your final thought.

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:27.620
My final thought is there's this laser pen advertisement on this one page here, and it's

01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:30.260
cool because it shoots a giant laser.

01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:32.740
I want a laser.

01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:33.740
Lasers are awesome.

01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:37.100
I guess it's shiny.

01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:41.100
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:49.260
I really, really, really, really, really am tired of drinking my own medicinal tea to

01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:56.820
make my throat work, and I want to cook something, but not right now.

01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:58.540
I want to cook for real.

01:39:58.540 --> 01:39:59.540
Bake me a pie.

01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:01.020
I'll bake Shepherd's pie.

01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:03.220
I'll make good Shepherd's pie.

01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:07.580
My final thought is that Legend of Zaku says this, yay, that means you OLR listeners must

01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:10.420
watch 24 next Sunday in the show's absence.

01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:15.860
I would actually support that because 24 is a show I need to get back into that's really

01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:18.140
good, and I'm going to TiVo it while we're gone.

01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:20.340
People should look for us at Disneyland if they're going to be there.

01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:21.340
Yeah, say hi.

01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:22.340
You can't miss us.

01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:25.760
If you've seen the little picture in the album art, you can't miss us.

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:29.660
We haven't changed much, although we do have new pictures coming, and I'm going to be working

01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:31.820
extra-super-duper hard on a new website this week.

01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:33.900
I'm very excited, and you'll see more about that.

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:37.020
Hopefully in two weeks we'll be able to launch it by the end of the month.

01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:38.020
I'm very excited.

01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:39.020
Rock on.

01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:42.220
And the Orange Launch Radio 07, baby.

01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:44.540
Speaking of those lasers, they're like two grand.

01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:46.340
Fuck that shit for a laser pointer.

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:47.340
But they bridge.

01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:48.340
I have a laser pointer.

01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:54.420
You can cut shit with them though, so that's awesome.

01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:57.260
You can literally burn out someone's retinas with that.

01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:59.920
All right, well thank you guys again.

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.920
We can't thank you enough.

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.860
It's your support that keeps us going.

01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:03.860
You guys are awesome.

01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:06.700
Orange Launch Radio is for you guys.

01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:07.700
Have a great week.

01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:11.220
We'll see you next week with a new podcast here on Orange Launch Radio.

01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:12.220
Thanks again.

01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:13.220
