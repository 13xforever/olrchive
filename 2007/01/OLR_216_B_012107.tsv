20000	25500	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday, January 21st, 2007
25500	29500	for our Part B of our little program we do here.
29500	35000	And, of course, our podcast or audio blog is released on Mondays and Wednesdays

47000	52000	Mikul Tov was guesting with us during Part A, but he's actually having to take off
52000	53500	so he won't be around for Part B.
53500	55000	So, bye-bye Mikul Tov!
55000	57500	And now we're going to get back into some news.
57500	59500	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight?
59500	61000	I don't wanna. Okay, well...
61000	62000	You have to.
62000	63000	Do I have to?
63000	64000	You have to.
64000	71500	Okay. Well, there is a game to be coming out called Flow
71500	73500	that had a December 6 release date.
73500	75000	And I say had.
75000	78500	It's now been pushed back to January 2007.
78500	80500	That means, you know, maybe a couple weeks from now, right?
80500	81500	Right.
81500	84500	But it just seems like there's, you know, more and more delays.
84500	88500	The speculation is that they're still fixing little stuff in it.
88500	92500	But when they were pressured for an official statement,
92500	95500	SCEA was basically stating,
95500	98500	We'll be posting a trailer at the end of this month, beginning of next.
98500	101500	As for the game itself, we will be releasing it near the end of February!
101500	103500	Wow.
103500	104500	February.
104500	105500	Yeah.
105500	107500	This is a very anticipated online title, though.
107500	109500	You know, I played the little online one. It's cute.
109500	111500	It should be interesting on a PS3.
111500	114500	It kind of reminds me of, I don't know, Electroplankton for some weird reason.
114500	115500	I love Electroplankton.
115500	117500	It just does. It kind of reminds me of that for some weird reason.
117500	119500	Right.
119500	122500	Speaking of music games, actually, I want to interject this
122500	124500	because I left this out of How Was My Gaming Week?
124500	126500	and I don't think it's in our show world tonight.
126500	128500	I had a chance, and I can't say how,
128500	133500	but I had a chance to play the dance MMO that's in closed beta right now.
133500	136500	And so I want to give you my thoughts on it.
136500	138500	It's kind of interesting.
138500	141500	There's a couple of licensed songs in it,
141500	143500	and then the rest of it is all normal stuff.
143500	145500	And, of course, it's set up very similar to DDR.
145500	150500	It's like a mix between DDR and one of those online Korean or Japanese games
150500	153500	that people play like R2 Beat, O2 Jam, those things.
153500	155500	The interface really reminds me of that.
155500	157500	I believe it was developed by one of those companies
157500	159500	because it shows the logo there in the beginning.
159500	161500	I noticed a couple of licensed songs.
161500	163500	There was a Madonna song in there, but an old one.
163500	165500	I think it was like Papa Don't Preach was in there.
165500	166500	And then, of course, I remember
166500	170500	Jump Around, Jump Around, Jump Up, Jump Up was in there, that song.
170500	173500	But some of the steps are pretty atrocious.
173500	174500	That's what I noticed.
174500	178500	It starts getting to be very in the groove level difficulty
178500	180500	when you get up pretty high, which on your fingers is...
180500	181500	I'm serious.
181500	184500	Some of these steps are just too crazy.
184500	187500	It's like finger-finger mania or something.
187500	188500	But otherwise...
188500	191500	Wow, that sounds fascinating to hear finger mania.
191500	193500	Otherwise, the game was...
193500	197500	It was very comparable to one of those other types of MMOs you would play.
197500	200500	And their music, although long, they don't edit the music down.
200500	203500	It was all like two, three and a half minute songs.
203500	205500	It fit pretty good.
205500	209500	I had a fairly okay time with it.
209500	210500	It screams polish to me.
210500	211500	I hope they don't...
211500	213500	No, I think they're going to add more stuff to it.
213500	216500	And I hear it's changing a lot.
216500	218500	You'll notice things get added and disappear,
218500	220500	so I think they're still putting some tweaks on it.
220500	224500	I'm going to try some more songs that have yet to go into it.
224500	226500	And I imagine...
226500	229500	They're probably still trying to figure out what the model is going to be.
229500	231500	I'm pretty sure the game is going to be free,
231500	232500	which I hope it is,
232500	237500	because I couldn't see myself paying much more than ten bucks for it.
237500	240500	I understand there might be licenses in the game and stuff,
240500	243500	but the game itself just not...
243500	245500	How many people play DDR on the PC?
245500	248500	Not enough, in my opinion.
248500	252500	It's really tough when there's a big DDR simulator out there
252500	258500	that's free and has thousands upon thousands of tracks
258500	261500	freely available out there.
261500	265500	Anyway, I just wanted to say that.
265500	266500	I got a chance to look at the beta,
266500	268500	and that's what's going on with it.
268500	270500	Anyway, back to the news.
270500	272500	Dark Soccer had brought up Flow for the PlayStation 3.
272500	276500	Another game that was being anticipated for the PlayStation 3 was Warhawk.
276500	280500	There was a rumor, and I emphasize a rumor going on right now,
280500	286500	that Warhawk could actually turn into a PS3 downloadable title instead,
286500	288500	just like a Gran Turismo HD.
288500	292500	I believe they did confirm saying that it was not cancelled.
292500	294500	It was not cancelled. That's good.
294500	296500	It would be interesting if you have all these games
296500	298500	that are kind of going down that path.
298500	300500	But apparently the whole rumor started
300500	302500	because there was a new director who was brought in
302500	305500	who was thinking about changing the whole direction for Warhawk.
305500	306500	Interesting.
306500	307500	Yes.
307500	310500	What's also interesting is that Wii and PlayStation 3 discs
310500	312500	have been dumped to ISOs,
312500	318500	making way for a whole new brand of piracy for the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
318500	321500	PlayStation 3 I could see because it's Blu-ray,
321500	324500	and the system has a hard drive built into it,
324500	329500	so I'm seeing something pretty similar to what happened with the PlayStation 2
329500	331500	happening with the PlayStation 3.
331500	337500	But right now, Cracking Group Paradox has dumped the first ISO,
337500	340500	not yet playable, but they've still dumped it,
340500	346500	and it's only a matter of time, of Motorstorm, the Japanese ISO for that.
346500	350500	And right now they're saying that the first few sectors
350500	353500	of the PlayStation 3 image are special
353500	356500	and may contain the decryption keys for the executables,
356500	361500	but right now they still haven't figured out exactly how to run stuff yet.
361500	364500	On the other front, though, with the Wii,
364500	368500	there's actually been a program released to be able to dump that,
368500	373500	and I believe it's two freely available programs to be able to dump those.
373500	377500	One, of course, is called DVD Info Pro.
377500	379500	That's available out there right now.
379500	384500	And then there's another program that you use once you have that,
384500	390500	the RAW to Dump, and they'll dump an image of the Wii DVD.
390500	393500	But of course, once again, they haven't figured out how to run those yet either.
393500	396500	But that's half the battles, dumping the disc,
396500	398500	and the other half is getting it on there and playing it,
398500	400500	so it's only a matter of time.
400500	404500	So how long before we see fully pirated Wii and PS3 games available on the Internet?
404500	405500	Probably a few months.
405500	408500	The Wii's kind of tricky because it's really hard to read those discs.
408500	410500	A normal computer can't read them,
410500	415500	so I'm not sure about the Blu-Ray ROMs for the PS3,
415500	418500	but I know that the Wii ones are pretty hard.
418500	420500	So I don't know. We'll see.
420500	426500	Hopefully, Sony's protection in the past has been pretty crappy,
426500	430500	so I wouldn't be surprised if we see this stuff pretty soon.
430500	433500	All right.
433500	443500	Well, as far as getting back into what is actually available and legally,
443500	450500	for our listeners in the UK, actually, there's some new games heading to a virtual console.
450500	454500	We have Street Fighter II going on there
454500	461500	and also a game called Super Probotector, which in the U.S. is Contra III,
461500	464500	which is so unfair because I want Contra III.
464500	468500	It's an 800 Wii Point game.
468500	473500	Goodwin, if you want to check it out, let me know how good it pulls over.
473500	476500	I've been pleased with everything that's come up for virtual consoles.
476500	479500	They still have Flickr. I think it's fantastic.
479500	482500	But those are new ones coming out.
482500	484500	Lucky.
484500	485500	Yeah, I want to know what we're getting.
485500	487500	We still don't know what we're getting tomorrow, do we?
487500	489500	There's rumors, but we don't know for sure, right?
489500	490500	I want Super Contra III.
490500	494500	We don't know, but there's other stuff that's in the works, I know that.
494500	496500	All kind of rumors, though, right?
496500	498500	I'm sure I've seen Kid Icarus, but...
498500	504500	Well, no, this is stuff that's, of course, coming from the ESRB website.
504500	507500	And I want to say, let me see here.
507500	510500	There was quite a bit that was coming out.
510500	514500	One of them was Bonk III for a virtual console.
514500	517500	That's coming out soon, at least.
517500	520500	And I know they were showing...
520500	521500	Well, Kid Icarus was on there a while ago.
521500	524500	Mighty Bomb Jack.
524500	527500	Xevious.
527500	529500	Let's see here, Jewel Quest 2.
529500	530500	I think that's...
530500	532500	Xevious was in last week's releases.
532500	536500	Yeah, that's probably a full game, the Jewel Quest 2 thing.
536500	539500	Let's see here.
539500	540500	That's all the ones I see.
540500	541500	What about the Nintendo originals?
541500	544500	Weren't there supposed to be, like, original virtual console things coming out?
544500	548500	Yeah, wasn't there supposed to be online play as well?
548500	550500	Right, it'll come eventually.
550500	552500	Like, eons away from now.
552500	554500	I guess all in good time.
554500	556500	We'll see.
556500	568500	Well, now, another very interesting story going around about the Wii is that, you know, of course, there's always these, I don't know what you'd call them, parental groups that want to prevent anybody from having fun.
568500	580500	Well, apparently, the WFAA has put out this thing going out that says that, hey, look, the Wii and the PlayStation 3 can get on the internet.
580500	588500	Therefore, your kids are accessing pornography through the Wii and the PlayStation 3.
588500	598500	Because, you know, how easy is it that you can go on and you can go click-click on, you know, Pornotube or something and go access some pornography?
598500	604500	I'm actually looking at the website here that says, oh, my gosh, these games are internet access.
604500	606500	They're gateways to pornography.
606500	612500	They can play WarioWare, Guitar Hero, and PlayStation 3 as well, and pornography.
612500	613500	I love the pornography game.
613500	618500	There's a quote here in this article, quote, they're innocent and we want to try and keep them that way.
618500	622500	It's very upsetting something this popular, a kid game, can go that direction so quickly.
622500	625500	Oh, shut up, stupid fucking...
625500	632500	And even in this story, in a blog one child boasted, the first thing I thought of when I downloaded the Wii browser was also porn.
632500	636500	Yeah, I'm sure it was really a child that was blogging about that shit.
636500	639500	Well, if they were under 18, you'd see a 17-year-old would be considered a child.
639500	644500	But it's the same damn thing as the computer, right?
644500	645500	Yeah.
645500	649500	If you have a PC in your house, that is also a gateway to porn.
649500	655500	So monitor your kids' Wii and PS3 use just like you do their PC use.
655500	656500	Duh.
656500	657500	How hard is that?
657500	660500	That kind of pisses me off that people are trying to spin this.
660500	664500	It's like, oh, my gosh, the Wii has chicks doing it on it.
664500	667500	Well, that's just like saying, you know, eating McDonald's is going to make you fat.
667500	670500	Then the next week later, oh, eating Burger King is going to make you fat.
670500	673500	And then the next week later, oh, Taco Bell is going to make you fat.
673500	675500	They're all gateways to fatness.
675500	682500	You know, well, it's just fucking stupid bitches that need the fucking attention.
682500	688500	And every news outlet seems to do this kind of shit too.
688500	693500	Oh, my God, it's because they don't have news and they need something to fill space.
693500	694500	That's what it fucking is.
694500	698500	And if there's another, you know, device that comes out there that's a gateway, you know,
698500	701500	that has the Internet on it, oh, my God, it's a gateway to porn.
701500	702500	You know what?
702500	706500	There's fucking goddamn child safety stuff on there.
706500	711500	They even have the update to block the Internet before, you know, the Internet browser was
711500	716500	even available and the weather too because, my God, there can be some pornography in the
716500	717500	weather.
717500	721500	Oh, I remember that one time there was the topless weather girl on the weather channel.
721500	723500	Well, this is something completely different.
723500	730500	I mean, they have the tools are there for the parents to use and it's just the parents
730500	731500	are being stupid.
731500	732500	And that's all it is.
732500	738500	And because for one, I mean, pulling up porn on the Wii is fucking slow.
738500	743500	I mean, granted, you can do it, but they have the parental controls on there.
743500	744500	Lots of good comments from chat chat.
744500	748500	Don't orange launch radio dot com live on this Sunday evening on this topic, DDR dollar
748500	751500	Bill says, fuck, the cell phone is a gateway to the Internet.
751500	753500	Thus, it can get on porno sites.
753500	757780	James Patrick says, well, there's porn sites built for the Wii like people, you know, kind
757780	760140	of catering to that whole thing.
760140	766080	And I'm looking at as well, let's see, Black Boy says, there are also programs that restrict
766080	770220	what websites can be accessed on the computer, but we don't really see anything like that
770220	771220	on the Wii yet.
771220	772220	Yeah.
772220	773220	It's called the parental controls.
773220	775020	Does that work on websites too?
775020	778020	It's for the whole Internet, blocks the whole Internet from.
778020	779280	Oh, okay.
779280	780280	Very interesting.
780280	785460	Also, somebody else said here that you could get it on the PSP as well, and they left it
785460	786460	out.
786460	789580	Well, Shadow Charlie says, PSP can give you porn, and they don't say shit about that.
789580	793500	And then Trax leaves us with this thought, if you can't rationally parent your child,
793500	795540	shouldn't have one in the first place.
795540	800000	Oh, and then, of course, S2H makes this groaner.
800000	802900	These parents are probably the same types who would let people drink two gallons of
802900	807300	water in a short time.
807300	809560	Now they win because water is a gateway to porn.
809560	815500	That takes us to our FUs of the Week, because you know what, when we hear about these stupid,
815500	819620	uninformed stories, we get very angry, and we want to rant a little bit, because we can.
819620	820620	It's our show.
820620	821620	We can do what we want.
821620	829980	Dark Soccer, are you ready to get angsty?
829980	833440	I've been ready.
833440	842700	My FU of the Week goes towards distance, and knowing that two people that I care an awful
842700	849020	lot about are separated by it right now.
849020	854340	I really don't know what else to say, just that I hope they hang in there and can't wait
854340	859020	to see them together again, and I'm talking about Chris and Megzy.
859020	865140	The official OLR lesbians will be reunited again soon.
865140	869300	Fucking to your neighbors, because they're dumb little kids that won't fucking get out
869300	870300	of the way of cars.
870300	874740	I mean, I'm sitting there trying to park my car, and they're playing football in the middle
874740	880340	street in the dark, by the way, and they won't fucking move, so fuck them, and I'm glad I
880340	884900	ran over your fucking toy last week, stupid bitches, and I will run you over if you get
884900	887780	my car away again.
887780	902220	My FU of the Week goes to my office chair, which is now sitting in the corner of the
902220	907700	room, broken, because it snapped in two places when my fat ass plopped in it the other day.
907700	920380	It's quite funny, because it is now the hoopy chair, because you can sit in and lean back.
920380	924940	A big thank you to Duck Tape, which I think will fix my chair soon, although Dark Sakura
924940	927820	did say I could probably get a new one pretty cheap at IKEA, and it would look better than
927820	931820	Duck Tape, and I do love me some IKEA, I need an excuse to go there.
931820	937100	I recommend, though, Duck Tape might fix Dark Sakura's chair.
937100	941300	I've tried to fix this chair with Duck Tape.
941300	943300	We should just cover the whole chair in Duck Tape.
943300	945820	No, because I don't want to be sneaky.
945820	947820	Maybe I'll get another chair soon, but that means money.
947820	950060	I'd adjust and it'd sound like a fart.
950060	951620	Oh, and FU to dental bills.
951620	956140	Oh, God, I hate when I go to the dentist, I feel like I'm going to a used car salesman.
956140	960260	They're trying to talk me into all this crap I don't need, and it's like, you know, if
960260	966080	I don't do it, then my teeth are all going to fall out, and I know that's not true.
966080	971140	My dentist is trying to get me to upgrade to a $1,000 crown.
971140	975940	A crown that costs $1,000 because they say my insurance will only cover a tin can.
975940	980140	I have a $1,000 crown.
980140	981940	Did you pay for all of that out of pocket?
981940	983940	I paid $500 out of it.
983940	985940	See, my insurance won't pay for any of it.
985940	986940	It sucks.
986940	990220	The whole reason I have the one I did is because it was absolute necessity because it was my
990220	992100	back molar that broke.
992100	995180	The root broke, and I had to have the whole thing pulled out.
995180	996180	No, no, no.
996180	997180	That's not my situation.
997180	1006140	See, don't feel bad about having, you know, the tin one when it could be a lot worse.
1006140	1007140	Exactly.
1007140	1010460	Anyway, moving on.
1010460	1014860	This is exactly why I don't go to the dentist.
1014860	1016620	When you go, you're going to be in for a surprise.
1016620	1020540	They're going to tell you that your teeth are fucked and you need $5,000 to fix them.
1020540	1023020	I'll tell them to fuck off and I'll leave.
1023020	1024100	This is why I never came back.
1024100	1028740	When your teeth hurt, I mean, teeth pain is the worst type of pain you can have anywhere.
1028740	1034700	I have one tooth that's been hurting, and I went to the dentist and suddenly they told
1034700	1039220	me $2,000 worth of work I needed, and I'm like, that's different if your teeth are hurting,
1039220	1040220	but mine aren't.
1040220	1043460	I only have one tooth that hurts, and they tell me I need work on all 20.
1043460	1046620	I have my wisdom teeth in because I'm wise.
1046620	1047620	That's why.
1047620	1048620	I hate the dentist.
1048620	1049620	I hate the dentist.
1049620	1050620	I wonder why people are afraid of the dentist.
1050620	1054660	I'm involved to have extra chewing power because I eat a lot of meat.
1054660	1061020	I need to eat twice the amount of animals to make up for the vegetarians.
1061020	1068300	The porn industry, they seem to be ahead of technology as far as video and stuff goes.
1068300	1074260	They were the first to have pre-recorded video cassettes, the first to jump on the DVD bandwagon,
1074260	1077700	and now the first to be using HD DVD.
1077700	1081500	That's kind of the format they're going with because of a couple reasons.
1081500	1086140	First off, HD DVD is a lot easier to produce and cheaper, and also there was that whole
1086140	1091220	fiasco of people saying that they're actually not going to let them duplicate Blu-Ray discs,
1091220	1092620	although I don't think that's really the case.
1092620	1093620	It's just more expensive.
1093620	1102460	Of the two formats, it seems to be out of an impartial survey during the adult entertainment
1102460	1107580	expo that was going on there that HD DVD sounds like the way it's going to go, at least for
1107580	1108580	the porn industry.
1108580	1112260	So, if you have a 360, there you go, some porn.
1112260	1116620	Although I do recommend, though, if you are going to watch porn on the PS3, just dump
1116620	1119540	it to your hard drive.
1119540	1120780	You know what, though?
1120780	1123620	I got to be honest.
1123620	1126460	If they do go to HD DVD, which it sounds like they're going to do, this is it.
1126460	1127620	It's over.
1127620	1128940	Format wars are over.
1128940	1133980	That's what ended VHS in beta when porn went to VHS.
1133980	1140700	I think, though, they make a good point that if it's cheaper to produce, then the disc
1140700	1145300	prices are going to be cheaper, but right now the retail for disc prices isn't any cheaper
1145300	1146460	than Blu-Ray.
1146460	1151880	So it comes down to the bottom line of price, what's going to cost these companies and what
1151880	1155540	kind of a margin they can make on this stuff because it's cheaper to produce for.
1155540	1160220	If it's going to be the same quality, then yeah, I think HD DVD is going to win out.
1160220	1162580	This is why I'm simply saying the format wars are over.
1162580	1168060	I don't mean to keep dogging on Sony, but look in the porn industry, and who doesn't
1168060	1169060	love some porn?
1169060	1171820	When they go for HD DVD, that's it.
1171820	1175580	Well, Sony is really kind of known for failed formats anyways.
1175580	1178420	I mean, let's see here, Betamax, UMD.
1178420	1180980	Kick them while they're down, Loki.
1180980	1181980	Kick them while they're down.
1181980	1188540	I mean, hey, you know, I support Sony just as much, but it's there.
1188540	1197060	Moving on, in New York State, Representative Keith Wright proposed legislation to block
1197060	1202260	the sales of games that depict racist and religious violence to minors.
1202260	1211500	The bill is A00547, and if it passed, it will block the sales of those games that glamorize
1211500	1216300	violent crime, suicide, sexual violence, violent racism, religious violence, and illegal use
1216300	1218980	of drugs or alcohol.
1218980	1224420	He's also called for retailers to play such games in an adults-only section.
1224420	1233900	Retailers would be required to check IDs for buyers under 30.
1233900	1238460	Again the problem I have with this, who checks what games meet this criteria?
1238460	1241060	What is considered violent?
1241060	1244060	That's why we have the ESRB.
1244060	1248100	I understand that, but I don't like it when I see these bills and they're so vague on
1248100	1252700	we want to put violent games behind a closed curtain.
1252700	1254660	Well, what's a violent game?
1254660	1262620	This one actually has been going a bit more to define it, to define the violence at any
1262620	1263620	rate.
1263620	1270700	However, racism is, I mean, basically anybody can get offended over something if it remotely
1270700	1279260	sounds racist to them, so I don't see how it's, and it works both ways too.
1279260	1285700	I think that honestly, again, it's not the place of our government to decide what gets
1285700	1286700	sold to who.
1286700	1290980	I think it's the job of the parents to take a more active role in what their children
1290980	1292700	are playing.
1292700	1298800	Talk to them, look in every so often, but in the end, it's not the place of our government
1298800	1299800	to decide.
1299800	1302140	We already have rating systems.
1302140	1309140	Most retailers already can't sell anything that's rated M to a minor, so why is this
1309140	1310140	necessary?
1310140	1314780	All this is is wasting more taxpayer money.
1314780	1316500	We hadn't done the FUs previously.
1316500	1321060	All right, anyway, moving on, I want to talk a little bit about PC gaming.
1321060	1324660	Remember, one of our New Year's resolutions was we were going to give some more love to
1324660	1329740	PC gaming, and well, technically this is about Mac gaming, but that's okay.
1329740	1330740	PC is personal computer.
1330740	1331740	It's everything.
1331740	1337060	So Mac fans are going to be in luck because it sounds like GameTap is planning to port
1337060	1343060	Myst Online over to the Mac, and also Myst Online is going to be getting a whole new
1343060	1344720	world to explore.
1344720	1348980	It's kind of weird though because GameTap is actually not available on the Mac, and
1348980	1352820	a lot of people say that's what's stopping them from getting on GameTap, and if GameTap
1352820	1355860	could bring their pretty big library over to the Mac, that would be something else.
1355860	1359460	Well, TransGaming is going to be the company that's actually going to bring the title over
1359460	1363280	to the Mac, so that's kind of cool.
1363280	1364480	No release as of yet.
1364480	1367940	It's just announced that it's happening, but those folks were looking into getting into
1367940	1370040	Myst Online.
1370040	1371040	There you have it.
1371040	1373780	You can do that on the Mac if you are so inclined.
1373780	1375760	There you go.
1375760	1380480	One cool game that's going to be coming to the PC, Monster Hunter, not a real huge franchise
1380480	1385140	in the United States, but it is pretty big over in Japan.
1385140	1388560	I think the last one they had was on the PSP.
1388560	1389560	Pretty cool series.
1389560	1396340	Kind of a cross between, almost like, Dynasty Warriors or Samurai Warriors and, say, Shadow
1396340	1397780	of the Colossus.
1397780	1404860	You're basically fighting dragons and stuff with really fantasy weapons and stuff like
1404860	1405860	that.
1405860	1406860	So, pretty cool.
1406860	1410820	Now, hopefully, they'll bring it to 360 or PlayStation 3 or something like that.
1410820	1411820	I'd like to see that.
1411820	1415100	Or even a PlayStation 2 release of the ones that they have in Japan.
1415100	1418980	Bandits was on the PS2 a while back, I think.
1418980	1421620	I'm not sure in the United States, but I know it was in Japan.
1421620	1426860	They've had a few in Japan.
1426860	1432740	I think there was the one on PS2, because I remember seeing it at Dan's old store.
1432740	1433740	Hmm.
1433740	1444460	Well, at any rate, as far as other games, there's the Battlefield 2142 Northern Strike
1444460	1446220	for the PC being worked on right now.
1446220	1447620	EA's announced it.
1447620	1453940	It's a booster pack being worked on by EA Digital Illusions Studio in Stockholm.
1453940	1455940	Wow, that's Swedish.
1455940	1460380	And it's scheduled for release in March 2007.
1460380	1467420	It's going to be a futuristic conflict that's following a second ice age.
1467420	1473460	They've released more details on the story, but it's also going to include three new maps,
1473460	1483300	the World War II battle scene at the bridge of Remagen, Alpine Titan, and a liberation
1483300	1484300	at Leipzig.
1484300	1488260	So, it seems like it's got some stuff going on.
1488260	1495220	Although, it seems to me most people prefer Battlefield 2 to Battlefield 2142.
1495220	1499980	I played like yay much of Battlefield 2 and decided it wasn't my kind of game, but have
1499980	1501900	you played a little more of this, Logie?
1501900	1502900	Nope.
1502900	1503900	Oh, I thought you had for some reason.
1503900	1508500	Oh, I had it for free, and I don't try to play too much PC.
1508500	1511380	In fact, the last PC game I played was Oblivion.
1511380	1516740	I loaded it on there, and my laptop barely runs it.
1516740	1521700	But, I played with a lot of cheat devices running at the same time, so I have my super
1521700	1522700	powered character.
1522700	1528060	So, it was fun going around and killing people from long distances away, unlocking spells
1528060	1535060	that were in there for test purposes, and just plainly exerting my force over the citizens
1535060	1536060	of a town.
1536060	1537060	That's what I like.
1537060	1538380	Why aren't you playing more PC games, man?
1538380	1541260	I need to play more Fable.
1541260	1542700	That's not really a PC game, though.
1542700	1544580	Why aren't you playing more PC games?
1544580	1549260	Because my PC's old, and because also I just don't have the time for it.
1549260	1551540	I mean, I just don't have the time for it.
1551540	1554260	You know, wife doesn't like playing games.
1554260	1555260	I see.
1555260	1557660	Well, maybe there'd be a PC game she likes.
1557660	1560180	Desperate Housewives of the Game came out, didn't it?
1560180	1561180	Should buy that for her.
1561180	1562820	See if the wife likes that.
1562820	1563820	No.
1563820	1567860	But, that reminds me, though, I should probably load up The Sims 2 again so I can kill more
1567860	1568860	Sims.
1568860	1572380	Oh, and maybe get Sims 2 Pets so I can kill animals, too.
1572380	1577820	All right, well, um, I wonder what you should, too bad you can't make them drink lots of
1577820	1578820	water.
1578820	1579820	Stop it.
1579820	1585580	Moving back to the console world, you know, folks that have 360s that are, you know, on
1585580	1589820	their last legs don't really want to have to send that back if they can help it.
1589820	1595100	Kotaku ran an interesting story earlier this week about an old urban legend about how you
1595100	1597500	can save a dying 360.
1597500	1602360	They're saying that you can wrap your busted 360 in a towel, turn it on, leave it on for
1602360	1607940	ten to fifteen minutes, turn it off, remove the towel, and turn it back on and it works.
1607940	1612060	And apparently this will cure the three red rings of death.
1612060	1616940	So this is just a rumor that they're running and apparently, you know, some commenters
1616940	1620540	on the site say, you know, it does kind of make sense.
1620540	1624740	One commenter on the site said it's kind of like a heat gun trick.
1624740	1629180	Instead of using a heat gun, you're using the heat coming off the CPU because you're
1629180	1630460	wrapping it up in the towels.
1630460	1631460	It's not a good idea.
1631460	1632460	Why?
1632460	1633460	Just put it that way.
1633460	1634460	It's not a good idea to do it.
1634460	1635460	Why?
1635460	1640220	Because before the thought was that they were overheating because the contact between the
1640220	1646060	heat sink and the actual processor, whatever they would, you know, put in there, wasn't
1646060	1647780	fully melted all the way.
1647780	1651220	And so using the heat gun, you would melt that so it didn't have a better contact with
1651220	1653980	the heat sink and it would cause it to not overheat.
1653980	1658620	Well, by wrapping this whole thing in a towel, you may be, you know, duplicating that, but
1658620	1662180	at the same time, you're overheating everything else and causing stuff to break.
1662180	1667220	So in a sense, I guess if you have the three rings of death already, you might as well
1667220	1669540	give it a shot because it's not going to hurt nothing.
1669540	1670540	But I mean...
1670540	1671540	Not going to help it either.
1671540	1672540	It's not going to probably help it either.
1672540	1676000	Well, JeremyTau1 says on the IGM message board, someone tried the towel trick and they said
1676000	1677540	it actually worked.
1677540	1679820	ActDeaf says, hey, I got the three rings of death.
1679820	1680820	Just hit your 360.
1680820	1682940	It really works.
1682940	1685900	And then, of course, we have a comment from Drunami.
1685900	1691740	Just give your 360 a lot of water.
1691740	1692740	Submerge it.
1692740	1694460	Topic change, please.
1694460	1696100	Submerge it into the ocean.
1696100	1697100	Topic change, please.
1697100	1701900	Anyway, speaking of funny, crazy stuff, let's talk about our friend, Ken Kutaragi.
1701900	1702900	Crayon Man!
1702900	1706540	In 2006, he had a lot of crazy things to say.
1706540	1710020	All the more reason I think that, you know, we should really get him to stop talking.
1710020	1715260	But there is actually a website, though, that compiled a pretty interesting list of his
1715260	1718040	quotes on PS3 today.
1718040	1722720	And so we thought we would share some of them with you and maybe have some discussion about
1722720	1724620	how crazy he is.
1724620	1727780	First off, the PlayStation 3 is not a game machine.
1727780	1730180	That was a quote from him.
1730180	1731860	So not a game machine.
1731860	1734060	I guess it's a computer.
1734060	1741140	Anyways, being us for a short moment is like accidentally winning a point from a Sheerhan,
1741140	1745240	a karate master, and Microsoft is still not a black belt.
1745240	1750420	Just like with their operating systems, they might come out with something good around
1750420	1753180	the third generation of their release.
1753180	1754340	So I don't get that.
1754340	1757340	That doesn't make any sense.
1757340	1758340	Let's see here.
1758340	1759340	Oh, this one's kind of funny.
1759340	1760980	Microsoft shoots for the moon.
1760980	1761980	So do you.
1761980	1762980	Did you just say Microsoft?
1762980	1763980	No, I think.
1763980	1766060	We're all having topic problems or talking problems.
1766060	1768060	See, I can't even talk.
1768060	1769060	We're all having talking problems.
1769060	1770060	I don't think that I've said anything.
1770060	1771900	It's in the water in this town.
1771900	1775980	The water not only is killing people, but it's making people stupid.
1775980	1778140	Anyways, Microsoft shoots for the moon.
1778140	1783980	Sony shoots for the sun.
1783980	1788860	This time Microsoft has stated clearly that it's going after the PlayStation.
1788860	1795360	However, not after the PlayStation 3, but the PlayStation 2, they were looking at 2
1795360	1799960	and that's why Xbox 360 became like that.
1799960	1803340	Because it's the second console from them, they're going after the second console from
1803340	1804340	Sony.
1804340	1807140	Yeah, no, that doesn't make any sense either.
1807140	1811440	With PlayStation or the PlayStation 3, our intentions have been to create a machine with
1811440	1815820	super computer calculation capabilities for home entertainment.
1815820	1816820	Okay.
1816820	1819520	All right.
1819520	1823860	And then I'm trying to find the funniest one here.
1823860	1827300	We're not going to equip the PlayStation 3 or the hard drive by default because no matter
1827300	1830700	how much capacity we put in it, it won't be enough.
1830700	1834900	Yeah, to load all those games that you're going to need to stream off your hard drive
1834900	1837140	because the Blu-ray drive is too slow.
1837140	1838700	Oh, this one's funny.
1838700	1840180	All right, last one.
1840180	1843580	The PlayStation 3 will instill discipline in our children and adults alike.
1843580	1847500	Everyone will know discipline.
1847500	1849420	Will the PS3 spank you when you're naughty?
1849420	1851100	Is that the kind of discipline it's going to be?
1851100	1855700	Because maybe I'd buy one if that's what it'll do.
1855700	1857460	Because I need some discipline.
1857460	1859900	The spank ray returns.
1859900	1861900	Hooray.
1861900	1863340	Old gaming reference there.
1863340	1867820	What also returns this week as it shows up every week except the week we were off last
1867820	1870160	week is DarkSakura's website of the week.
1870160	1874440	She serves the internet up and down and left and right and back and forth and all over
1874440	1875440	the place.
1875440	1879760	In fact, I hear there's 13 different ways she can hold her internet including the mortar
1879760	1885540	and pestle and she finds a website that she likes and shares it all with you here on our
1885540	1886540	program.
1886540	1887540	It's called DarkSakura's website of the week.
1887540	1888540	See?
1888540	1889540	It's something in the water.
1889540	1890540	I don't drink the water, though.
1890540	1891540	I had coffee.
1891540	1892540	Coffee is made of water, stupid.
1892540	1893540	I didn't use tap water, though.
1893540	1894540	I used filtered water.
1894540	1895540	I filter all the stupid out of it.
1895540	1896540	Whatever.
1896540	1910540	Anyway, the website of the week is YouParkLikeAnAsshole.com, best site ever.
1910540	1921340	This site actually has downloadable notices that you can leave on people's cars like in
1921340	1923940	fraction number one and fraction number two.
1923940	1929020	They're available in PDF format and you can leave them on cars that you see parked badly
1929020	1934020	as in double parking, being too close to the line where no one can get out of the car next
1934020	1935860	to them.
1935860	1942820	The best thing about it is that it has check marks that you can put on there to say, like,
1942820	1947460	listed two spots, one car, a little too close, too far away from the driveway, too close
1947460	1952420	to my driveway, over the painted lines, diagonal parking, cool car, diagonal parking, not so
1952420	1958100	cool car, move up, that's compact, and others so that you can walk it in.
1958100	1961780	And there's a disclaimer that says, Parking is far too limited in our overcrowded streets
1961780	1964780	and parking lots and you happen to park like an asshole.
1964780	1968300	Go to the above website to see why someone else thought you parked like an asshole.
1968300	1971620	Don't be too offended, we all do it one time or another, it just so happens that you got
1971620	1972620	caught.
1972620	1976460	Dude, Jamie, I'll give you a quarter to leave one on next to first car.
1976460	1978700	Dude, I'd do it for free.
1978700	1981140	Well, what was I going to say?
1981140	1983140	And you can also send pictures to the site, too.
1983140	1987700	They need the one that's like four corners, it's where you park in four spaces at once,
1987700	1990620	you know, like just down the center of the crossing.
1990620	1993180	I'm going to go to the site, look, I have a little printer right here, a little cheap
1993180	1997860	ass $30 printer, I'm going to go to the site, first thing when I can, when the show is done,
1997860	2000700	I'm going to print some out and carry them around in my car and I'll let you know how
2000700	2001700	many I use.
2001700	2005300	Actually, yesterday, when I was getting sushi, there were these people who were just parked,
2005300	2009820	I mean, really freaking parked badly, like the line was in the middle of both of their
2009820	2010820	cars.
2010820	2013740	Well, how about they need the one on there that says this is not a parking spot, you
2013740	2018380	know, it's like in the middle of the road or like double parked or just wherever.
2018380	2023140	Well, also, you can, well, this is what I did, I actually just hand wrote notes and
2023140	2027700	left diagrams pointing the proper way to park and the first one says, you park like an idiot,
2027700	2031100	you learn how to do this when you're a teenager, don't do it again, and the other one was,
2031100	2033620	you park like you're retarded, get back on the short bus.
2033620	2038740	Wow, that's, what if the person, what if the person really was mentally challenged, that
2038740	2039740	would have been, that would have been.
2039740	2040740	Then they don't need to be driving.
2040740	2046380	But this person was triple parked, I kid you not, not even for legitimate reasons, it was
2046380	2047380	at a restaurant.
2047380	2052540	Alright, real quick here, I got one more Ken Kutaragi quote, I missed this one, it says,
2052540	2056620	if processors of high performance and wide bandwidth like the cell were linked together
2056620	2062220	without sufficient security, a worldwide system crash could occur with one attack.
2062220	2066020	Is there a site called YouTalkLikeAnAsshole.com?
2066020	2069220	I don't know.
2069220	2074820	Speaking of assholes, here's one in training, apparently a nine-year-old child stole their
2074820	2081780	neighbor's car, got spotted by police on the interstate, guns it to a 90 mile an hour chase,
2081780	2086520	the kid tried to take an exit ramp but the engine blew and the car hit a curb, went into
2086520	2088820	a tree and the kid gets captured.
2088820	2091220	How the hell did a nine-year-old learn to drive a car?
2091220	2096500	I had to do so many loops in the parking lot at my high school with a driver's ed instructor
2096500	2098840	before I was ever able to figure out how to drive.
2098840	2101220	Same way I did, Ridge Racer.
2101220	2108820	Well, yeah, you're not helping much because apparently according to what was going on
2108820	2114420	is that the mom believed that PlayStation taught him how to do all this, so apparently
2114420	2118220	either Grand Theft Auto or Ridge Racer, this is where he learned to drive and do all this
2118220	2119980	and hightail it to get away from the cops.
2119980	2120980	You're not helping Dark Soccer.
2120980	2122540	Well, did you see the other part of this?
2122540	2124340	They don't have accurate driving simulators.
2124340	2126060	I think it was arcade games that did it.
2126060	2127340	It's all Gran Turismo's fault.
2127340	2130700	Did you see the real driving simulator?
2130700	2134620	Anyways, did you see the rest of the story where they were talking about how he, before
2134620	2139580	that, also recently evaded airport security, managing the Hoppa flight?
2139580	2142260	No, they're trying to turn it into Chuck Norris.
2142260	2143260	Come on.
2143260	2144260	Oh, that'd be funny.
2144260	2149380	See, that'd be cool if he actually did that because I'd give props to the kid, but yeah,
2149380	2151300	I think, though, seriously...
2151300	2152420	Props to the kid?
2152420	2155380	That's my tax dollars paying to bust his ass.
2155380	2156380	Fuck that.
2156380	2157380	Put him in juvie.
2157380	2162300	No, props to the kid because the parents should get, you know, fucking billed for something
2162300	2163300	for this shit.
2163300	2165920	I absolutely agree the parents should be billed for it all.
2165920	2170740	My tax dollars should not go to pay for this stupid kid.
2170740	2172700	Don't let little Billy in the goddamn car.
2172700	2173700	It's a gateway to porn.
2173700	2174700	Well, he stole the neighbor's car.
2174700	2175700	He could drive to a porno shop.
2175700	2177540	Where did he learn to steal a car?
2177540	2178540	You can't...
2178540	2181420	In a video game, you press X to steal the car.
2181420	2183340	You did not go through the whole process.
2183340	2184620	He didn't steal a car.
2184620	2185620	Here's what happened.
2185620	2189260	Little fucking, you know, mommy went into the store, Billy, stay in the car, I'm going
2189260	2192380	to leave it running, got in the driver's seat and drove off.
2192380	2193380	That's what happened.
2193380	2194380	It said it was the neighbor's car.
2194380	2195380	Well, fine.
2195380	2196860	The neighbor let him into the car.
2196860	2198880	What are they doing leaving their car unlocked?
2198880	2200460	With the keys in the ignition.
2200460	2204060	With a crazy nine-year-old in the neighborhood.
2204060	2207620	Dennis the Menace, we're on to you.
2207620	2215260	Anyways, so speaking of crazy driving and stuff, Burnout 5 is coming out and I cannot
2215260	2216260	wait for that.
2216260	2221100	And I know that, you know, apparently there's been some screenshots where pedestrians have
2221100	2222100	been spotted.
2222100	2225160	I can only hope that that were the case, but unfortunately I'm thinking this is from some
2225160	2227460	sort of cut scene in the game.
2227460	2232500	But if there's pedestrians and I can hit them going 200 miles an hour, that sold the game
2232500	2233740	twice to me right there.
2233740	2234740	Seriously, me too.
2234740	2239020	I'm like, seriously, if there's actually pedestrians on the road that like run away from your car
2239020	2242940	and stuff, oh my God, did I just buy this game like three times.
2242940	2247540	Burnout is so hot to begin with, like it's one of my favorite racers.
2247540	2248540	It really is awesome.
2248540	2249540	Except for the soundtracks.
2249540	2250540	I always change.
2250540	2251540	That's why I love 360.
2251540	2252940	You can just change out the soundtrack.
2252940	2255260	But oh man, oh man.
2255260	2259660	I want an M-rated game, oh fuck that, you know, an adult-only game where I can blow
2259660	2260660	these people.
2260660	2266180	I want to see blood splatters and skull fragments shattering into my window.
2266180	2267180	That'd be awesome.
2267180	2273020	Seriously, I think if, you know, especially with Rockstar and the next Grand Theft Auto
2273020	2277580	game, hell, just to go adult-only and just fucking go crazy.
2277580	2279060	Go fucking nuts.
2279060	2282740	Just have a normal, like, do like movies, you know, have a rated version of the game
2282740	2284740	and have the underrated, you know.
2284740	2290540	That way you can still sell as many copies and, you know, some people will buy the underrated
2290540	2295300	where you can fucking blow people up and have skull fragments, you know, slam into your
2295300	2296300	car.
2296300	2300380	It'd be cool, though, if like the skull fragments could impale other people and embed in their
2300380	2301860	skulls and kill them.
2301860	2302860	Yeah.
2302860	2304260	That'd be fantastic.
2304260	2305260	Anyway.
2305260	2307060	You guys are morbid.
2307060	2308060	I am not.
2308060	2311980	I would love to read some chat comments right now, but I just totally got booted from chat.
2311980	2313980	I pinged out, so I'm trying to get back to you.
2313980	2314980	I'll read chat comments.
2314980	2315980	Thank you.
2315980	2316980	Is there anything interesting?
2316980	2317980	Dark Sakura is awesome.
2317980	2319980	Real ones, please.
2319980	2328540	They're just like saying a yay burnout and red asphalt, someone said.
2328540	2329540	Ouch.
2329540	2339660	But moving on to the next story, speaking of fun violence, we have Calling All Cars,
2339660	2345420	formerly known as Criminal Crackdown, which is supposed to be a mix of stuff like Bomberman
2345420	2350740	and Twisted Metal and Demolition Derby with explosions and crashes and criminals and crashes
2350740	2352460	and more crashes and more crashes.
2352460	2354500	It kind of looks like Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2.
2354500	2355500	I know.
2355500	2360100	It has that same sort of, well, it's more of a diagonally overhead view, I think.
2360100	2367300	But Sony Computer Entertainment is saying that it would be out by March.
2367300	2369980	So let's hope so.
2369980	2371980	That looks kind of fun to me.
2371980	2375220	I love exploding stuff.
2375220	2376540	I love the description here.
2376540	2385060	It says Tom and Jerry type violence with mass destruction.
2385060	2386060	Sounds interesting.
2386060	2387060	All right.
2387060	2392820	Well, we're going to take your calls pretty soon on our Skype line, which is 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2392820	2394120	The username is Skype.
2394120	2397780	But one other thing that that phone line can be used for is to leave voicemails when we're
2397780	2398900	not here.
2398900	2413780	We like to play some of our favorite voicemails on the air when we're not able to take your
2413780	2414780	calls live.
2414780	2416380	And we're going to play some of those voicemails right now.
2416380	2419020	We got some really good ones from the last couple shows.
2419020	2420580	So here's our first voicemail.
2420580	2421580	This one's about two minutes.
2421580	2422580	Hi.
2422580	2424340	This is Razorburn 2021.
2424340	2426820	I wanted to make some comments on last week's show.
2426820	2432340	I just got done with my weekly listen, and ParadoxVincent's call about Wii Sports kind
2432340	2437420	of got me thinking about a problem I've been having for the last couple of gens with Nintendo
2437420	2438420	product.
2438420	2442580	It's one of the things that kind of held me back from really getting into it, and it's
2442580	2447260	kind of a Nintendo fanaticism.
2447260	2455540	Guys like ParadoxVincent, if you can't look at a game like Wii Sports, I mean, I'm huge.
2455540	2459740	I really, really enjoy Gears of War, but I can look at it and see why there are people
2459740	2461020	that won't like it.
2461020	2464860	I can see why people would see it as boring or that it just doesn't have the flair they're
2464860	2465860	looking for.
2465860	2470460	If you can't look at Wii Sports and see why a critic would bash it, I think you've really
2470460	2473980	kind of let yourself get a little too into Nintendo.
2473980	2478260	There's this feeling out there that Nintendo can do no wrong, and I think Graybush, when
2478260	2483780	you had your interview, touched on a little bit that most systems have fans that are way,
2483780	2488860	way harder on their games than Nintendo, because I think right now Wii fanatics are kind of
2488860	2493900	really thirsty for every game to be this, specifically the Nintendo titles, to be a
2493900	2494900	huge success.
2494900	2500020	I've heard stories from most podcasts I listen to about, well, over the holidays I took it
2500020	2504460	and my grandma wanted to play Wii Sports, but yeah, I mean, I've heard that a lot that
2504460	2508420	how many of your grandmas really are going out and buying a Wii.
2508420	2512220	You say, well, Grandma came over and she wanted to talk to me about Wii, but I mean, how many
2512220	2517140	of the grandmas are sitting around the hair parlor and saying, well, where's Edith?
2517140	2519380	Last week I played Wii Bowling!
2519380	2521940	Gaming has come a long way, but I think it's come a long way.
2521940	2526140	I'm sure your grandpa will play Wii Sports with you, but I don't think, you know, he
2526140	2527140	was a nom.
2527140	2528700	He's not going to sit down and play elephants.
2528700	2534540	I think that you need to be able to see both sides of an argument to really be a gamer,
2534540	2538140	and I think if you're really looking at the Wii from this perspective of there's going
2538140	2542660	to be this rude awakening because everybody can get into it, I think that's looking at
2542660	2543660	it wrong.
2543660	2548260	I think that if you're someone who's a true gamer, you know, maybe it should bother you
2548260	2552940	a little bit that everything's being simplified so that everyone can be into it.
2552940	2557980	I'm being kind of rambly now and now my call's gone too long, so I'm just going to let you
2557980	2558980	go.
2558980	2559980	Love you.
2559980	2562960	Well, thank you very much for the voicemail.
2562960	2564420	We appreciate it.
2564420	2567420	You know, it's kind of interesting.
2567420	2570380	I'm kind of trying to think back to the show when that was taped and kind of everything
2570380	2573900	that we said that was going on there.
2573900	2577780	I don't think it's necessarily that Nintendo can do no wrong, because certainly at least
2577780	2581100	us here in the studio pointed out many faults that Nintendo's done.
2581100	2584620	We were just making fun of Red Steel earlier, although granted that's a third-party title,
2584620	2586780	but most people would say, hey, it's a mistake.
2586780	2588020	Nintendo's not online right now.
2588020	2592460	They should have made some different decisions maybe with the Wii, and they're certainly
2592460	2594100	capable of doing things that are wrong.
2594100	2597740	I just think maybe folks thought that that particular review on Wii Sports was really
2597740	2602220	harsh because of the fact that so many people can pick up and go with Wii Sports.
2602220	2606940	I suppose you're right that grandmas and grandpas aren't exactly buying Wiis, and that's what
2606940	2608100	it's all about.
2608100	2610980	But I think not so much grandmas and grandpas, but parents.
2610980	2615420	I think if parents feel like they could get into a video game system with their children,
2615420	2617860	I think that's what could really sell the Wii systems right there.
2617860	2622460	I think that's kind of the thing that maybe that particular caller was going for in that
2622460	2623460	call.
2623460	2627780	But certainly Nintendo is not without their own faults.
2627780	2631580	Wii Sports may not have been on my top ten of the year necessarily, but I thought it
2631580	2634300	was a good game and better than average.
2634300	2638700	I don't think it was deserving of a negative review, but I suppose everybody has their
2638700	2639700	opinions.
2639700	2640700	Thanks for the voicemail, though.
2640700	2641700	That was kind of funny.
2641700	2642700	I like that.
2642700	2643700	You're a funny guy.
2643700	2644700	All right.
2644700	2646980	Let's go to our next voicemail and our last voicemail of the week.
2646980	2647980	Hey, guys.
2647980	2650540	This is Mr. Wonderful from the forum.
2650540	2654540	I just wanted to chime in with what Sky was saying on the most recent show about gaming
2654540	2656740	journalism being in for a rude awakening.
2656740	2657740	I couldn't agree more.
2657740	2662260	I'm a gaming journalist myself, and for too long the gaming journalism community has really
2662260	2666460	just been focusing on what they perceive to be hardcore and trying to tell the community
2666460	2670960	about what's new and hardcore and underground, but they're a mainstream publication.
2670960	2673060	They need to appeal to all walks of life.
2673060	2676660	They need to appeal to the gaming public as a whole, not just niches.
2676660	2680740	So I think that the Wii is going to provide a huge awakening, it's going to provide a
2680740	2686900	revolution, if you will, of this community, because journalists can't just say, you know,
2686900	2691020	Gears of War is the greatest game ever because, you know, Cliffy B made it and all this.
2691020	2694900	There's a lot of new gamers out there who don't know who Cliffy B is and probably don't
2694900	2695900	care.
2695900	2699060	They're going to have to start covering more, a wider range of topics, and they're going
2699060	2702140	to have to start backing up claims, going to start.
2702140	2705620	I think we're going to see a new age of gaming magazines.
2705620	2710180	They can't just keep continuing on the path they're on or this huge audience that Nintendo
2710180	2715140	has got is not going to be buying their magazines if they don't understand a damn word of them.
2715140	2719100	So yeah, I agree pretty much wholeheartedly with what you're saying.
2719100	2723380	It's going to be an interesting time for journalism as well as gaming, and I can't wait to see
2723380	2727460	where it goes, but if somebody doesn't pick up on this trend that there's non-gamers that
2727460	2731820	are gaming now, then I don't think they're going to get into it, whereas if there is
2731820	2736820	a magazine out there that caters to this idea that people who haven't played games and don't
2736820	2742420	know as much about the history or the culture of gaming, and kind of a my first gaming magazine,
2742420	2746180	if you will, I think something like that could have huge success.
2746180	2749140	So I'd really like to see something like that happen.
2749140	2751020	Great show and keep up the great work.
2751020	2753020	Looking forward to the next one.
2753020	2754020	Take it easy, guys.
2754020	2755020	Thank you very much for the voicemail.
2755020	2756020	We appreciate it.
2756020	2757020	I don't know.
2757020	2758020	What do you guys think?
2758020	2759740	Again, this goes back to the whole casual gaming magazine.
2759740	2764660	Although I agree with what the guy is saying, because he was agreeing with me, I don't know
2764660	2767860	if I necessarily think, and kind of reflecting and thinking about that, I don't know if a
2767860	2772580	casual gaming magazine would really sell, because people usually buy magazines for their
2772580	2776100	hobbies and the things they're really into, so I don't know if necessarily a casual gaming
2776100	2779620	magazine would sell, but I kind of go back to something I had referenced on that particular
2779620	2784080	show where I said magazines like Entertainment Weekly and so on need to expand on their gaming
2784080	2790660	sections and magazines that are dedicated to entertainment and those types of things
2790660	2795340	in general should look at these things from a casual game perspective.
2795340	2798340	That was my thought.
2798340	2800260	Anything else you guys want to add?
2800260	2803980	I don't know.
2803980	2809100	I'm just glad that they have the perspectives out there for casual gamers as well as a hardcore
2809100	2813980	gamer because a lot of people just don't really get the perspectives of the other person.
2813980	2818380	So it's kind of good that they have that kind of stuff out there.
2818380	2821740	DJ Morpheus in chat says, why doesn't OLR play hate voicemails?
2821740	2822740	Because everyone loves us.
2822740	2823740	We don't get hate voicemails.
2823740	2824740	Start sending them in.
2824740	2829140	Yeah, call and leave us some, I don't know.
2829140	2831820	We listen to them and get a chuckle out of it and then we delete it.
2831820	2838060	Let's see, James Patrick has a good comment, saying Nintendo fans are crazy is stupid.
2838060	2842220	Madden fans, GTA fans, a lot of fans are just as bad.
2842220	2849540	SSJ 100 Matt has an interesting comment.
2849540	2852300	Some Nintendo fanboys are getting as bad as Scientologists.
2852300	2856500	When someone says something bad about it, they go on the offensive, like the Zelda 8.8
2856500	2857500	rating.
2857500	2861900	I agree people got their panties way too ruffled over that one.
2861900	2866660	People in general should just realize it's just some dude's opinion who happens to work
2866660	2869980	for a big website that all you people visit.
2869980	2873920	I don't know why, but you do and you apparently listen to what they have to say, but in the
2873920	2880220	end it's just one dude's opinion.
2880220	2885500	What makes these people any more qualified than you, you or me?
2885500	2888700	I mean, I realize they went to journalism school, they know how to write and they have
2888700	2891860	a love of games, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and all that stuff.
2891860	2894060	But I have a love of games.
2894060	2898980	You that listened and downloaded this video game podcast has a love of games.
2898980	2903420	So these guys know their spelling and their grammar and how to write a good review.
2903420	2904660	That's about it.
2904660	2909340	It doesn't always mean, I mean, I don't think, to be honest, that a lot of these people have
2909340	2911620	gone to journalism school.
2911620	2913900	I think they're just being hired, so.
2913900	2918180	I could almost, in fact, I know for a fact not all of them have.
2918180	2920180	I know that for a fact.
2920180	2924060	Oh well, that's what we got.
2924060	2925060	Any more news?
2925060	2929340	Yes, we definitely have some new stuff.
2929340	2931740	So this was pretty exciting.
2931740	2936780	All week long they've been kind of teasing stuff, starting off with a YouTube video of
2936780	2938580	some prototype footage of it.
2938580	2944620	Brand new Ghostbusters game and it's being produced by a company called ZootFly and right
2944620	2947780	now it's something that they're developing right now, they're working on it.
2947780	2952220	Problem is, of course, they're being held up by a lot of the licensing issues, you know,
2952220	2955580	with the movie, etc.
2955580	2960460	So it's something that's being currently worked on, but it looks pretty cool so far.
2960460	2965580	And right now, on top of the Ghostbusters game, ZootFly is also working on another game
2965580	2971100	called Time Zero and it's basically, it's kind of related to Ghostbusters a little bit,
2971100	2979500	talks about two adventurers who are die-hard New Yorkers and they get trapped in a deep,
2979500	2983940	like the shadow world of a parallel New York and the city itself is actually a war machine
2983940	2987180	threatening to wipe out the world and they have three days to stop it.
2987180	2991140	So that's kind of neat, they're working on that and I know they're also working on another
2991140	2996700	game called Toy Wars, which is coming to the Xbox Live Arcade, which looks pretty cool
2996700	2997700	too.
2997700	3004500	So hopefully people, you know, so far the response has been pretty good on it and a
3004500	3009060	lot of fans want to see this thing made, so hopefully a publisher jumps on this and gets
3009060	3014820	the licensing rights paid for and hopefully we see this game, you know, come to fruition.
3014820	3015820	Alright.
3015820	3021180	Well, that sounds pretty cool and I like that screenshot of the toy game that you showed
3021180	3023580	me and that's kind of cool.
3023580	3024580	Yeah.
3024580	3025820	Is this something you'll probably buy?
3025820	3027060	It would be.
3027060	3029580	I like Ghostbusters, I think it'd be fun.
3029580	3030680	Will it have the song in it?
3030680	3031680	That's all I want to know.
3031680	3036580	Um, actually the song is different, they have a rock version of it in the video that they
3036580	3038300	were showing, so I liked it.
3038300	3039300	I thought it was pretty cool.
3039300	3040300	Alright.
3040300	3041300	Very cool.
3041300	3042300	Alright.
3042300	3044940	Well, this is the point of the show where we're going to open up the Skype line.
3044940	3048860	If you want to give us a call, our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype or you can give
3048860	3053580	us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR, which is toll free in the US and Canada.
3053580	3059820	Sorry, UK folks and those in other countries, whether it be Australia, wherever you're at,
3059820	3063740	you'll have to use the old fashioned method of calling us on Skype, which I guess isn't
3063740	3066060	really old fashioned, but for us it is.
3066060	3067060	Let's go to the phones.
3067060	3069140	I'm getting a lot of calls tonight already.
3069140	3071020	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
3071020	3072020	Who's this?
3072020	3073020	Hey, what's up?
3073020	3074020	It's the Rob D in chat.
3074020	3075020	Hey, the Rob D in chat.
3075020	3076020	I like your name.
3076020	3077020	Thank you.
3077020	3078020	What's on your mind, buddy?
3078020	3079020	Not too much.
3079020	3083220	I was just going to talk about that one article you read about how the Wii is a gateway to
3083220	3084220	porn.
3084220	3088260	By the way, I just want to say before we start getting into this, I want to say Rob D's quality
3088260	3090020	is like perfect right now.
3090020	3092980	I'm loving this call because I don't hear myself echoing in the background.
3092980	3093980	No static.
3093980	3094980	No static.
3094980	3096700	I can hear his volume is perfect.
3096700	3098700	This is a model phone call, boys and girls.
3098700	3099700	I applaud you.
3099700	3101220	You have a good enunciation.
3101220	3102220	I do.
3102220	3106140	I applaud you, Rob D. Not to knock on the other callers because I realize it's internet
3106140	3110020	radio and what have you, but Rob D, whatever you've done to set yourself up, you need to
3110020	3111780	share that with everybody.
3111780	3112780	It's great.
3112780	3113780	Sounds great.
3113780	3114780	All right.
3114780	3115780	So the Wii porn story.
3115780	3116780	What do you want to say?
3116780	3117780	All right.
3117780	3120300	So basically, I don't know if you actually covered this.
3120300	3124700	I unfortunately was watching part of the Colts game, so I was kind of halfway listening to
3124700	3126180	OLR.
3126180	3127180	We forgive you.
3127180	3128180	Yeah.
3128180	3129180	I'm sorry.
3129180	3130180	Okay.
3130180	3134220	So I don't know if you covered this, but did you read the quote from a supposed child where
3134220	3138080	he said, the first thing I did when I got the Wii was think about porn or something
3138080	3139080	like that?
3139080	3140080	Yeah.
3140080	3141640	Something that the website had got from their blog.
3141640	3144780	They went and looked at a blog and say, hey, one child said on their blog that the first
3144780	3149220	thing I thought about when I got the Wii was porn or it was the Wii browser.
3149220	3152140	First thing I thought about when the Wii browser was porn.
3152140	3154900	So I was curious about that since it mentioned that it was a blog.
3154900	3158540	I plugged the quote into Google just to see where it was from.
3158540	3160140	Ah, good thinking, my friend.
3160140	3161860	Where did it come from?
3161860	3163740	It's from a post on Kotaku.
3163740	3164740	On where?
3164740	3165740	Kotaku.
3165740	3166740	Really?
3166740	3167980	It was a comment to some random article.
3167980	3168980	I forget what it was.
3168980	3175300	Oh, I thought you were going to say MySpace.
3175300	3179140	That's interesting because then how would they know that it was a child because Kotaku's
3179140	3182060	commenting system doesn't tell a person their age, right?
3182060	3184820	Well, here's what's actually funny about this.
3184820	3192180	The comment immediately preceding that quote was, as a male aged 18 to 35.
3192180	3197460	And I kid you not, that's exactly what it was.
3197460	3200880	And he is quoted as a child in that article.
3200880	3203220	So they're totally stretching the facts and stuff.
3203220	3204220	Not surprising.
3204220	3210500	I'll find the web page and shove it in chat just to verify that I'm not pulling this out
3210500	3211500	of nowhere.
3211500	3212500	No, I believe you.
3212500	3216460	I believe the power of Google is an amazing thing.
3216460	3217460	But that's kind of funny.
3217460	3223420	I just thought that the fact that they just took things totally out of context is rather
3223420	3224420	interesting.
3224420	3227540	Someone needs to email WPAA and ask them to explain themselves.
3227540	3231900	Yeah, and this is almost as good as that one article a year ago about how the PSP pulls
3231900	3233100	porn out of thin air.
3233100	3237620	Oh, some folks in chat don't know what Kotaku is, so we should say it's a big gaming blog.
3237620	3243820	If you know Destructoid or even like IGN and GameSpot's news feed, it's very similar.
3243820	3244820	It's just a game blog.
3244820	3247820	You can put an RSS in your reader and get all their news and stuff.
3247820	3248820	That's what Kotaku is.
3248820	3252180	I'm sorry, what was the other thing you were saying?
3252180	3259500	I was saying it's almost as good as the article about a year ago when it said that the PSP
3259500	3261980	pulled porn out of thin air.
3261980	3263860	It made up porn.
3263860	3264860	Exactly.
3264860	3269660	Like, hey, dude, if the PS3 would pull porn out of thin air, I'd buy it.
3269660	3271660	Oh, and no Blu-ray, doesn't it?
3271660	3273700	Yeah, now we do.
3273700	3277100	It actually reminds me of the story where we had the DS.
3277100	3281340	And remember that the one TV news station did a story about child predators on the DS
3281340	3282340	in PictoChat?
3282340	3286100	That's what it reminds me of.
3286100	3287220	Too many penis drawings?
3287220	3292380	No, the fact that like, oh my gosh, your four-year-old might be playing on the Nintendo DS and a
3292380	3295740	child predator could write something sexual on it.
3295740	3300580	But what people forget is that if somebody's doing that, that person is in the room with
3300580	3301580	you.
3301580	3304300	Those DSes do not have that huge a range.
3304300	3305780	I don't know.
3305780	3308220	All right, well, anyway, that's all I had to say.
3308220	3310340	That's what was going on at E3 a couple of years ago.
3310340	3311340	Well, that's different.
3311340	3312340	That's E3.
3312340	3313980	You put all the nerds in a room and that's what's going to happen.
3313980	3315620	All right, Rob D. We appreciate the call.
3315620	3316620	Lincoln Chat, by the way.
3316620	3317620	What?
3317620	3318620	What's that?
3318620	3319620	I tossed a Lincoln Chat.
3319620	3320620	Oh, great, thank you.
3320620	3321620	We'll take a look at that.
3321620	3322620	Anyway, thanks for taking my call.
3322620	3323620	I'll see you guys later.
3323620	3324620	No problem.
3324620	3325620	Have a good one, buddy.
3325620	3326620	Thanks for the call.
3326620	3327620	Model O-L-R phone call.
3327620	3331380	Yes, it looks like, of course, since I said that, he did cut out a couple times during
3331380	3333300	the call, but that's just probably our connection.
3333300	3336620	That's all the people playing fucking World of Warcraft in the other room that's causing
3336620	3337620	that.
3337620	3338620	That's what's up.
3338620	3340420	Let's go to another call.
3340420	3341740	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3341740	3342740	Who's this?
3342740	3346300	It's everyone's favorite caller, Raven's Dolphin.
3346300	3347980	Oh, Raven's Dolphin.
3347980	3352100	What can we do for you this week, buddy?
3352100	3353220	Absolutely nothing.
3353220	3357820	I just want to comment on the Wii thing and the PSP thing.
3357820	3360220	I just have to say this first.
3360220	3364980	You're becoming quite the famous little caller of Internet radio programs I'm noticing.
3364980	3367620	Yeah, I figured that.
3367620	3372460	You should start your own show.
3372460	3375900	Not that I'm discouraging you from calling into programs, but it's obvious you have a
3375900	3377660	lot to say.
3377660	3383140	If we haven't proven this fact, any schmo with a microphone can do a show, you should
3383140	3385580	think about it.
3385580	3386820	I was thinking about it.
3386820	3388500	I'm definitely thinking about it.
3388500	3393180	It's just the thing about it is money, and can I keep it going for an hour?
3393180	3397820	DJ Morpheus says, how about a show of clips of him just calling into other shows?
3397820	3400420	That's a brilliant idea.
3400420	3401820	I'm just fucking with you, Raven's Dolphin.
3401820	3402820	What's on your mind, really?
3402820	3403820	I'm sorry.
3403820	3409540	I just want to say that I watched that clip of the Wii, when they talk about the people
3409540	3410540	pouring.
3410540	3414820	The two girls that had the Wii, they took it in and I pushed pause, and they didn't
3414820	3415820	even have the Internet browser.
3415820	3419220	I didn't even have the Internet at all.
3419220	3421860	Oh, so you watched the clip on the TV site?
3421860	3425340	You watched a clip of the girls playing with the Wii, and they didn't even have the Internet
3425340	3426340	channel on it?
3426340	3428340	They didn't even have it, honest.
3428340	3433940	They went to the news channel like, look, it's a game with the porn, and I don't
3433940	3435540	even think they even have Internet.
3435540	3443300	You have to download it off the Wii, but there are so many different things you have to do.
3443300	3451060	Your quality is kind of screwing up there, buddy, but damn the media for doing that.
3451060	3455660	Somebody probably said something to someone, and they create this story around it.
3455660	3456660	That's kind of how it works.
3456660	3461020	You know, I studied broadcast journalism in college, and I'll tell you what, usually
3461020	3464620	what it is is just like, here's an idea, run with it, and make a story out of it.
3464620	3465900	So that's what happened.
3465900	3468140	Somebody told somebody, hey, did you know the Wii can get porn?
3468140	3473860	Some reporter did their job and made a compelling story out of it by fabricating a few truths
3473860	3474860	here and there.
3474860	3481020	Yeah, I just feel like TV is just failing me now.
3481020	3484500	You have to take some of the things that you hear on the news with a grain of salt, unfortunately,
3484500	3486980	especially these types of investigation stories.
3486980	3491540	It's one thing to report on a fire that's engulfed an entire neighborhood or whatever,
3491540	3497260	and it's another thing to report on these types of moral issues.
3497260	3500480	I'm hoping to get a live 365 stream soon.
3500480	3502780	It's just a matter of money.
3502780	3508540	Good luck to you, Ravenstaufen, and if you get your own show, we've got your back.
3508540	3509540	Thank you.
3509540	3511180	I have your back, too.
3511180	3512180	We know.
3512180	3513740	Have a good one, buddy.
3513740	3514740	You too.
3514740	3515740	Bye.
3515740	3516740	Later.
3516740	3517740	All right.
3517740	3518740	Oop, did I just hang up on someone else?
3518740	3519740	Okay, let's go.
3519740	3521940	Phone lines are open.
3521940	3524500	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3524500	3525780	You can always call us on Skype.
3525780	3527460	Our username is orangeloungeradio.
3527460	3530980	Does anybody have any last-minute stories real quick?
3530980	3532820	Interject here in between some calls?
3532820	3536680	Yeah, just a couple things real quick.
3536680	3543820	Mega Man Star Force is actually getting a pretty cool peripheral for the DS, and it's
3543820	3552300	some sort of card scanning system that they had for Animal Crossing and some other stuff
3552300	3558780	before, so you can actually plug that in and scan your Mega Man cards to be able to play
3558780	3563060	in the role-playing game as well, so that's kind of neat.
3563060	3571020	And then Eidos has grabbed the rights for Daffy Duck and The O.C., so we're going to
3571020	3573020	see some crappy games based on that.
3573020	3574020	The O.C.?
3574020	3575020	But The O.C. cancelled.
3575020	3576020	I don't get it.
3576020	3578020	All the perfect time to make a game.
3578020	3579380	We're getting another call real quick.
3579380	3580380	Let's go to this one.
3580380	3581500	This is a conference.
3581500	3584900	I'm a little worried about this one, but I guess we'll pick this up anyway.
3584900	3588180	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, and I'm speaking to two people?
3588180	3590480	No, I don't know what you're talking about.
3590480	3591820	My Skype's being glitchy.
3591820	3593940	Okay, well, what's up, DMN?
3593940	3595340	What's on your mind?
3595340	3596340	Not much.
3596340	3597740	I'm calling to defend WarioWare.
3597740	3600660	Okay, oh yes, because I didn't give it a negative review.
3600660	3605820	I said it's fun, but like most Wariowares, I don't see the magic lasting.
3605820	3609460	Well, like most Wariowares, there you go, Rob.
3609460	3611340	It's the same thing.
3611340	3615740	I think everybody in your chat room, everybody who listens to your show, and you including
3615740	3619560	myself, I knew that this game was going to have a lot of shit, but it was going to be
3619560	3622580	three hours long of gameplay.
3622580	3624900	But it's a great party game.
3624900	3627280	It is, and I don't disagree with you there.
3627280	3629020	So what do you want to defend?
3629020	3633340	Where am I wrong in my assessment of WarioWare?
3633340	3634340	Just because you're stupid.
3634340	3635340	No.
3635340	3638420	I have to agree with that, too.
3638420	3640020	Yeah, I knew it.
3640020	3641540	I knew there was two people on the line.
3641540	3643540	Rama, you're there, too?
3643540	3650860	Never mind the fact that there's two people on the line right now, whatever, but what's
3650860	3653860	this whole defending WarioWare thing?
3653860	3656340	I can't tell you why.
3656340	3660140	Okay, Rama, you care to chime in on this whole thing?
3660140	3665060	No, because I haven't played WarioWare yet, but I can say this because of you guys, I
3665060	3668820	did buy two new games, Luminous Mobile and Cooking Mama.
3668820	3672260	Did you hear that, Rama, about Cooking Mama because of us?
3672260	3673260	He told me last night.
3673260	3674260	Oh, my gosh.
3674260	3675260	Luminous Mobile!
3675260	3679100	It's the only mobile game I think I've ever talked good about on this program, so it's
3679100	3680100	worth it.
3680100	3681100	It's a good buy.
3681100	3685500	Yeah, I'm paying like $1.99 for it a month, and I'm connected to a server, so top rankings
3685500	3686500	and stuff like that.
3686500	3689340	I'm like, eh, no big deal.
3689340	3695580	But another thing about WarioWare, going back to that, is this shows almost everything that
3695580	3702540	the Wii can do, even more so than Wii Sports did.
3702540	3705540	I could rent it and get a lot of that.
3705540	3708900	You could.
3708900	3713900	I think it's worth a buy if you have, like me, I always have people over here.
3713900	3717860	I don't know if you get that from OLR, but this place has become party central, and it's
3717860	3719820	starting to look like it, too.
3719820	3721020	There's people here all the time.
3721020	3725300	Thusly, WarioWare, Mario Party, those games are excellent buys for me.
3725300	3729780	For anybody with a large family or something, I just think for single player people, it's
3729780	3730780	going to wear thin.
3730780	3736420	Yeah, and it's a whole other show to tell you what I've seen strewn about Rob's place.
3736420	3739860	One thing I do want to agree with you on, I do think the $50 price tag for that game
3739860	3740860	is quite steep.
3740860	3746740	I think maybe if it was released at $29.99, maybe $39.99, that's kind of pushing the envelope,
3746740	3753660	but I don't think $49.99 was a good idea, and I don't agree with Nintendo on that decision.
3753660	3756820	Well, that's what it is.
3756820	3759860	Now I'm going to do something I've always wanted to do on this program, and I'm going
3759860	3762740	to hang up on two people at once.
3762740	3764620	You suck!
3764620	3765620	No!
3765620	3772740	That was fun.
3772740	3776320	And that would be Pwned, with a capital P, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio.
3776320	3777320	One more call.
3777320	3780660	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
3780660	3781660	It's Legend of Zaku.
3781660	3782900	Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.
3782900	3783900	What's on your mind, my friend?
3783900	3784900	Sure would be complete without a call from you.
3784900	3785900	I know.
3785900	3786900	God damn.
3786900	3787900	We were just wondering when you'd get through.
3787900	3789980	It's the first one of the year, though.
3789980	3792920	Well, what's up, Zaku?
3792920	3799500	You know about the whole weed debacle about the DJs going too far and not sure, basically
3799500	3804020	fucking up when they shouldn't, when they shouldn't, you know, taking diligence.
3804020	3805740	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3805740	3806740	What's the point?
3806740	3809900	I mean, I'm not trying to belittle your call, and your opinion is certainly important, but
3809900	3812820	God damn if I haven't talked about this issue until I've been blue in the face.
3812820	3814620	Remember, Zaku, I live here.
3814620	3818500	If you think it's water cooler top where you are, it's like ten times as much where I am,
3818500	3820700	because like everybody thinks they knew her.
3820700	3824460	Right there, it's a local, one of the local things that's happening around the back of
3824460	3825460	the woods.
3825460	3832740	And so, I mean, I could see that they're able to face involuntary manslaughter charges just
3832740	3839780	for the fact that if you heard the tapes and all the recordings that were actually saved,
3839780	3842780	you could see on their part that they're just shrugging off people that could have warned
3842780	3846260	them and they just, they show no regard.
3846260	3853180	They said that they had like, they had them sign a liability, you know, waiver.
3853180	3858540	You know, I go back to what someone in chat said earlier, it's not just the DJs.
3858540	3861620	There were ten people that went into making this contest.
3861620	3864740	The DJs just egged it on, but that's their job.
3864740	3870140	Yeah, the people basically, not only the DJs, but the people involved in, you know, organizing
3870140	3876100	the event, they face, they're going to, they'll face justice eventually.
3876100	3879900	And I think in a civil trial, the entire station is going to pay for it.
3879900	3885120	I wouldn't doubt, I got to be honest, Naku, I wouldn't doubt if that station doesn't go
3885120	3886860	through some radical changes.
3886860	3890660	I bet you anything that entire, and I'll keep you posted, but I bet you that whole station
3890660	3892620	goes down over this.
3892620	3896100	They change their name or their look or something, they're going to have to distance themselves
3896100	3897100	from this somewhere.
3897100	3902180	I mean, when it's showing up on the BBC's website that your little local radio station
3902180	3908580	threw this contest that resulted in the death of someone, that whole station's in for it.
3908580	3909580	Right, think about it.
3909580	3913740	And I'll tell you something else, Naku, it sucks.
3913740	3914740	The station sucks.
3914740	3917180	I mean, I hardly ever listen to it.
3917180	3921900	It's like Britney Spears and all that kind of crap is what they play on there.
3921900	3924340	In New York, they call it Z100.
3924340	3926340	Yeah, Z100 essentially.
3926340	3927340	Yes.
3927340	3931780	Basically, I mean, when you have that, I mean, remember what happened with Opie and Anthony
3931780	3937580	when they pulled that stunt a few years ago, they got him kicked off a terrestrial radio
3937580	3938580	for the first time?
3938580	3941580	Yeah, but having sex in a church isn't going to kill someone.
3941580	3944580	The station actually went through a lot of format shifts.
3944580	3946980	It changed formats throughout the years.
3946980	3953620	The time of the incident until now has just went through what, a second format change?
3953620	3958220	So yeah, I mean, they tried their best to distance themselves and what I see in the
3958220	3960580	future, I hope not, but I mean...
3960580	3961580	Make it quick, Zaku.
3961580	3963140	They want this topic banned in chat.
3963140	3964140	Final thought.
3964140	3969300	It might just reformat the station and that's about it.
3969300	3973380	I mean, they will face justice eventually, so, you know, one of these people will end
3973380	3974380	up paying.
3974380	3977180	Well, we'll keep you here posted on Orange Lounge Radio.
3977180	3980300	Unless this continues to have nothing to do with gaming, then we probably won't say anything
3980300	3981300	at all.
3981300	3982300	All right.
3982300	3983300	All right, have a good one, Zaku.
3983300	3984300	See you later.
3984300	3985300	See you later.
3985300	3986300	Bye.
3986300	3989620	I don't know how you guys feel about this, but my personal thought is I'm willing to
3989620	3992660	talk about this as long as it has to do with gaming.
3992660	3996040	If Nintendo is brought into the suit, then it has to do with gaming, but if it stays
3996040	3997820	the way it is, I don't really want to talk about it anymore.
3997820	3998820	We've said enough.
3998820	3999820	Nail in the coffin.
3999820	4000820	Thank you.
4000820	4001820	One more call.
4001820	4002820	Oh, damn.
4002820	4003820	It just went away.
4003820	4004820	Let me have a little call back.
4004820	4005820	Any more last minute?
4005820	4008060	Finish up that thought on the last minute story you had real quick.
4008060	4009060	Oh, yeah.
4009060	4013940	This is the one that's coming out for the Wii and other game that's being put out that's
4013940	4022300	actually going to be kind of like a, what is it, a crazy taxi but with emergency vehicles
4022300	4028020	called Emergency Mayhem that's being put out by Codemasters, also going to be on the PS2
4028020	4029020	and the PSP.
4029020	4032420	That looks kind of fun.
4032420	4033420	That's it.
4033420	4034420	That's all I got.
4034420	4035420	All right.
4035420	4036420	We got our caller again.
4036420	4037420	Let's go to the phone.
4037420	4038420	This will be the last one.
4038420	4039420	Hey, Mario.
4039420	4040420	Mario Trejo.
4040420	4041420	Who's this?
4041420	4042420	Hey, ShadowNextGen.
4042420	4043420	Hi, ShadowNextGen.
4043420	4044420	What's on your mind, my friend?
4044420	4046940	How's it going, guys?
4046940	4048260	Pretty good, you know.
4048260	4049260	It goes.
4049260	4050260	It goes.
4050260	4053860	First of all, since I haven't been able to call in for a while, I want to say I really
4053860	4056540	enjoyed your appearance on AGI.
4056540	4057540	Thank you.
4057540	4060940	We've actually been getting quite a few compliments on that.
4060940	4061940	That's something else.
4061940	4063640	You know, we like working with Scott and them.
4063640	4064640	It's fun.
4064640	4065640	Yeah.
4065640	4071180	I thought tomorrow's show should be funny if Scott shows up since his Patriots lost.
4071180	4074880	You know, I don't really follow football, but yeah, I do know he was pretty passionate
4074880	4077260	about the game tonight, so that should be interesting.
4077260	4080620	But aren't they off all week?
4080620	4083780	They have a show tomorrow, I believe, and then they're off.
4083780	4084780	Interesting.
4084780	4085780	All right.
4085780	4089620	Well, what's on your mind tonight in regards to gaming?
4089620	4094780	I was curious about – it was actually a comment, I think it was AGI made a while back.
4094780	4098260	It was either AGI or you guys, because I listened to both of you a lot.
4098260	4101900	They were worried about with the Wii's price point – this was back in October, September
4101900	4106100	– about how since Nintendo was supposed to have all of these different consoles, how
4106100	4111380	you would be able to walk into a store and find anyone with no problem, and therefore
4111380	4114980	they thought there would be a problem because people would see it as, you know, since it's
4114980	4118380	already there, you know, it wasn't really that good or it wasn't that hot of an item
4118380	4119380	type of thing.
4119380	4124120	I can't remember if we said that or – I don't think that we would have said that,
4124120	4128900	because my kind of viewpoint on it is that I think, you know, a little bit of demand
4128900	4131340	is a good thing, but this is too much.
4131340	4132340	This is too much.
4132340	4134340	This is exactly what Microsoft went through, you know?
4134340	4135340	Yeah.
4135340	4136340	Yeah.
4136340	4138780	Well, no, I was just kind of curious about what your thoughts were as how people were
4138780	4143180	predicting now what happens, and now the exact opposite has happened where you cannot find
4143180	4147700	a Wii anywhere, but you can almost walk into any store and find a PS3.
4147700	4148700	Yeah.
4148700	4152340	You know, but I wonder how much – I don't have any sales stats, I don't know, but
4152340	4154140	how much of this is Nintendo making?
4154140	4156660	I mean, how has production been at the Wiis?
4156660	4157660	Been pretty low.
4157660	4161060	Yeah, because what I understand is that we all have this impression that the Wiis are
4161060	4164620	just rolling off the freaking assembly line, but I believe I heard somewhere else that
4164620	4167980	the actual amount of shipments that these places are getting are not weekly.
4167980	4172180	No, they're not weekly, and I want to say the last shipment we got was in December.
4172180	4176180	The next one we're getting is this week, and that's how long it's been.
4176180	4179100	It's been a few weeks since we've gotten anything, and it's because they're sold
4179100	4180100	out.
4180100	4185860	They're sold out of DS, they're sold out of Zelda, the GameCube Zelda.
4185860	4187860	They're just way behind in everything.
4187860	4189460	They're too damn popular.
4189460	4192980	And the thing with the PS3 being in stock is not because they're shipping a ton of
4192980	4196540	units, it's because they're not selling as many units as they're shipping.
4196540	4199660	They're just getting, you know, shipments every now and then, but they're just not
4199660	4200660	selling them.
4200660	4204140	It's not the hot item they thought it would be, or at least not yet.
4204140	4208020	Well, the system's not going to sell very well if there's only 13 games out for it,
4208020	4210540	so that's a problem.
4210540	4215020	Out of curiosity, are you a Wii or PlayStation 3 owner yourself?
4215020	4216340	A Wii and a 360.
4216340	4218260	Ah, so you're a Wii 60 camp.
4218260	4219900	Any interest in PS3?
4219900	4221620	Excuse me?
4221620	4224740	Any interest in PS3?
4224740	4226260	Maybe down the line.
4226260	4231580	It will depend on how many more exclusively Sony.
4231580	4233140	You sound just like me.
4233140	4239900	All I need to hear is basically a Final Fantasy or a Kingdom Hearts on the 360, and I might
4239900	4241100	be done with Sony.
4241100	4242620	Yeah, I know.
4242620	4248700	If Square came out tomorrow and announced Kingdom Hearts 3 for the 360, put a fork in
4248700	4251500	Sony as far as I'm concerned.
4251500	4252500	But I don't know.
4252500	4256180	Again, I say that kind of jokingly on here, but I don't know.
4256180	4262060	Let's not forget that Katamari Damacy was a very excellent, albeit third-party, exclusive
4262060	4263060	game.
4263060	4264060	I guess all these games are third-party exclusives.
4264060	4265060	They went over to Sony.
4265060	4270140	It was just an awesome game, and PS2 took a little while to build up some steam.
4270140	4272540	I didn't buy a PS2 on launch day.
4272540	4273540	I didn't buy one for a while.
4273540	4276060	I don't think I bought one until Final Fantasy X came out.
4276060	4279460	I didn't get one until the Slim Units came out was when I got my PS2.
4279460	4280460	Oh, you know what?
4280460	4281660	I had an import one for the longest time.
4281660	4282660	That's what it was.
4282660	4286900	Well, anyhow, anything else you want to share with tonight's program?
4286900	4288860	Yeah, I had another question for you guys.
4288860	4293220	I know it's probably a little late, but I was wondering if there was any particular
4293220	4300700	game or series in 2006 that you guys wanted to play but didn't get to?
4300700	4306300	Any particular series or game in 2006 that we wanted to play but didn't get to?
4306300	4308860	That you didn't have the time to get to or whatnot?
4308860	4314460	Maybe something you were looking forward to but you just didn't get to it for whatever
4314460	4315740	reason?
4315740	4318780	How about games that I didn't spend enough time with that I wanted to spend more time
4318780	4319780	with?
4319780	4320780	Trauma Center.
4320780	4324560	Yeah, well, I actually did play a lot of Trauma Center.
4324560	4329800	The Final Fantasy games, like I played 12 enough to know that I put in a pretty good
4329800	4330800	chunk of hours.
4330800	4335140	I went after the double digits and hours, but I wish I could spend more time with that
4335140	4337380	and I needed to play Final Fantasy III enough.
4337380	4341400	I never did get Cooking Mama and Jamie won't shut up about it, so I know I needed to check
4341400	4343740	that one out.
4343740	4348380	I'm trying to think what other franchises.
4348380	4349500	Not a lot coming to mind.
4349500	4352180	I have played most of the stuff I wanted to play.
4352180	4355780	Probably PC gaming and I think a lot of the stuff on PC.
4355780	4357860	You know Sam and Max, those original games?
4357860	4361780	I heard a lot of good stuff about them and even a GameTap subscriber just haven't had
4361780	4362780	the time to check those out.
4362780	4365500	I've heard a lot of good things about them, so that's on my to-do list.
4365500	4369860	So I guess that's my answer, Sam and Max.
4369860	4374340	Have any of you guys tried out the Shadow Hearts RPG series?
4374340	4377060	I've heard of it and I've heard really good things about it and I have a friend who's
4377060	4379280	playing it, but I haven't played it myself.
4379280	4381300	Is that something you think ought to be on my list?
4381300	4383540	Yeah, they're excellent games.
4383540	4384620	They have three of them out now.
4384620	4386700	I don't know how well they sell.
4386700	4391260	They sell well enough to where the sequels have been coming out, but I think it's one
4391260	4394980	of them that flies under a lot of people's radar for whatever reason.
4394980	4395980	Are those on GameCube?
4395980	4396980	PS2.
4396980	4397980	A PS2?
4397980	4400180	I am thinking of something else.
4400180	4401180	I've heard of it.
4401180	4402180	I've heard of it, too.
4402180	4403180	I haven't really played it.
4403180	4404180	I still wanted to play it, Connie.
4404180	4406180	Yeah, you guys should try to have enough time if you can.
4406180	4410300	Like I said, there are three games and they are a lot of fun, especially if you do RPGs.
4410300	4411640	They're kind of a little off the wall.
4411640	4417460	They have somewhat of a historical perspective, but then a lot of it is they spun history,
4417460	4420740	so there's fiction in it, too.
4420740	4421740	Send some info to my email.
4421740	4422740	I'll check it out.
4422740	4424500	I'll at least rent it if nothing else.
4424500	4425500	Yeah, okay.
4425500	4430020	And then once fixed on it, then I'll clear the line for you guys.
4430020	4431020	Yup.
4431020	4435620	Loki, have you heard about the Wii Play pre-orders being sold out with GameStop and EB?
4435620	4440020	Loki, have you heard about the Wii Play bundles being sold out with GameStop and EB?
4440020	4441020	Yup.
4441020	4443380	What do you think of that?
4443380	4444380	What do I think of that?
4444380	4446220	Do you know anybody else who's doing pre-orders for that?
4446220	4451220	Yeah, I know a lot of local mom and pop stores are doing pre-orders because I know we got
4451220	4458860	our allocations, and we got quite a bit of units allocated to us, so I'm surprised that
4458860	4461540	they're sold out already.
4461540	4464700	I'm hearing Wii Play's not worth it unless you need the controller.
4464700	4467140	That's what it is.
4467140	4470300	Everyone's getting in for the controller, and it's basically almost like a free game
4470300	4471300	with it.
4471300	4472300	Alright, well...
4472300	4473300	But it's $50, right?
4473300	4474300	Isn't it $49.99?
4474300	4475300	No, that's right.
4475300	4476300	I thought it was $39.99.
4476300	4477300	Is it $39?
4477300	4478300	No, that's $40.
4478300	4479300	I'm wrong.
4479300	4480300	$49.99.
4480300	4486060	Alright, well, thanks for taking my call, guys, and I'm a big fan as always.
4486060	4487060	No problem.
4487060	4488460	We appreciate the call and the game recommendation.
4488460	4489460	Have a good one, buddy.
4489460	4491460	Yeah, talk to you later.
4491460	4492460	Later.
4492460	4493460	Yup.
4493460	4494620	You know, like I said, we have day jobs and all that stuff.
4494620	4497260	We can't always get around to playing everything, but we try.
4497260	4499700	Between the three of us, we play an awful lot.
4499700	4505220	I like to play a lot of types of role-playing games, although somehow I missed that one.
4505220	4510580	Loki likes to play the shoot-and-kill-the-hooker type games, and Jamie likes to play really
4510580	4512660	weird shit.
4512660	4514500	I don't play weird shit.
4514500	4516820	No, you like to play Kingdom Hearts, that's what you like to play.
4516820	4517820	Yes, I do.
4517820	4523820	I was going to say, there's a funny website I read about today, I forgot to mention.
4523820	4526500	TheBigBoxProject.com.
4526500	4537300	It's about this guy who sent back a console, an Xbox 360 console, to Microsoft originally,
4537300	4543420	and the problem is they sent it back and it's still busted, so now between the time he sent
4543420	4546500	the first one in and the second one needs to go back, they've changed their policy and
4546500	4551940	they want him to pay to have it fixed or whatever, so he's like, okay, fine, if that's the case,
4551940	4555580	I'm going to send this in the biggest fucking box I can find.
4555580	4564660	So he's trying to pay to get one of those rail car crates, the big giant rail cars to
4564660	4571700	deliver this thing in, and it's funny because on the website if you go to it, it has a little
4571700	4575060	dialogue on here, it says, how big is your repair center?
4575060	4579660	And then their technician's like, I don't see how that pertains to the situation, sir,
4579660	4585380	because I'm going to send you my broken Xbox in the biggest damn box you've ever seen.
4585380	4587380	Will it be filled with little styrofoam pellets?
4587380	4588940	That's what I want to know.
4588940	4590460	I can only hope.
4590460	4600860	Can you imagine, somebody pokes a little hole in the box and suddenly they're under a mountain
4600860	4605980	of styrofoam pellets.
4605980	4608460	Can you wrap the Xbox in that much bubble wrap?
4608460	4612500	It should be wrapped in duct tape, solid duct tape.
4612500	4617060	That would be a better use of your money right there, is to take the box and wrap the whole
4617060	4625420	box in two feet of duct tape, two feet thick, and that would be awesome to send.
4625420	4628380	Sounds like a Daffy Duck cartoon, sorry, I'm just imagining the opening.
4628380	4631580	You wouldn't even be able to cut through it, you'd have to saw through it to get to the
4631580	4632580	Xbox.
4632580	4633580	Wow.
4633580	4637460	Of course, if I were just them, I'd just be like, return to sender, bitch.
4637460	4646780	Any last minute stories from you, Dark Sakura?
4646780	4647780	Not I.
4647780	4648780	No?
4648780	4649780	How's it going?
4649780	4650780	You've been kind of quiet tonight.
4650780	4651780	You okay?
4651780	4652780	Yeah, I'm okay.
4652780	4653780	Just making sure.
4653780	4654780	Need a hug?
4654780	4655780	No, I need food.
4655780	4656780	Eat some coffee.
4656780	4657780	Well, food, sounds good.
4657780	4658780	No coffee, I have to sleep eventually.
4658780	4661820	Well, to get to the food, we have to get to our final thoughts, because we've got to wrap
4661820	4663380	this thing up.
4663380	4664940	Thank you guys so much for listening to us.
4664940	4668700	Let's go around and get the final thoughts, Loki.
4668700	4673020	My final thought is, I need to play more Resistance.
4673020	4676420	My final thought is, I'm getting my PlayStation 2 back from my friend, because I have this
4676420	4679980	urge to play Kingdom Hearts ever since I got back from Disneyland.
4679980	4681700	Damn Disneyland, damn it.
4681700	4686380	Also, do you know I subscribed to video podcasts this week that talk about Disneyland?
4686380	4688900	And yeah, that's pretty sad.
4688900	4690220	I'm turning into Jamie.
4690220	4696500	Jamie, your final thought, you need some gas X?
4696500	4697500	No.
4697500	4699900	You don't have anything else to say?
4699900	4703140	You don't have a certain phrase you say every week on the show?
4703140	4704140	Kiss my ass.
4704140	4711020	You're not going to say to reject?
4711020	4712020	Kiss my ass.
4712020	4713020	All right, fine.
4713020	4714020	I'm just checking.
4714020	4715820	Want to make sure that's the official final thought.
4715820	4719820	All right, bend over.
4719820	4723260	Thank you so much, everybody, for tuning into and downloading our podcast and supporting
4723260	4724900	independent internet radio.
4724900	4726540	You guys are awesome for doing so.
4726540	4731340	If you would be so kind to leave us a kind review on iTunes or dig our program over on
4731340	4736020	dig.com or just tell a friend is really the best thing you could do, because if you tell
4736020	4740620	a friend about our program, then that's how we stay in business, because we don't have
4740620	4744060	those marketing dollars behind us, because we're po like you.
4744060	4747400	Well, if you aren't poor, then send us money.
4747400	4770420	On that note, have a great night, and we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
