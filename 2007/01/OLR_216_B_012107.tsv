487	5572	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5892	14741	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15461	19085	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20199	20439	Mikhail Tov,
49063	54885	was guesting with us during Part A, but he's actually having to take off, so he won't be around for Part B. So bye-bye, Miklatov.
55925	57266	And now we're going to get back into some news.
57946	59207	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight?
59987	61027	I don't want to.
61167	61627	You have to.
62408	63068	Do I have to?
63248	63768	You have to.
64308	64668	Okay.
65609	73632	Well, there is a game to be coming out called Flow that had a December 6 release date.
73912	74772	And I say had.
75869	76009	Wow.
76029	76189	February.
105553	105833	Yeah.
105893	108193	This is a very anticipated online title, though, you know.
108234	109414	I played the little online one.
109474	109894	It's cute.
110554	111494	It should be interesting on a PS3.
111514	114635	It kind of reminds me of, I don't know, Electroplankton for some weird reason.
114975	115755	I love Electroplankton.
115775	116175	It just does.
116195	117595	It kind of reminds me of that for some weird reason.
119575	126437	Speaking of music games, actually, I want to interject this because I forgot to... I left this out of How Was My Gaming Week, and I don't think it's in our show role tonight.
126917	133258	I had a chance, and I can't say how, but I had a chance to play the Dance MMO that's in closed beta right now.
134941	136403	and so I want to give you my thoughts on it.
137063	137924	It's kind of interesting.
138785	143569	There's a couple licensed songs in it and then the rest of it is all normal stuff.
143590	145411	And of course it's set up very similar to DDR.
145772	153960	It's like a mix between DDR and one of those online Korean or Japanese games that people play like R2-B, O2 Jam, those things.
154320	156002	The interface really reminds me of that.
156042	159325	I believe it was developed by one of those companies because it shows the logo there in the beginning.
160065	161245	I noticed a couple of licensed songs.
161266	163086	There was a Madonna song in there, but an old one.
163106	164667	I think it was like Papa Don't Preach was in there.
164967	169988	And then, of course, I remember Jump Around, Jump Around, Jump Up, Jump Up was in there, that song.
170068	173409	But some of the steps are pretty atrocious.
173449	174269	That's what I noticed.
174309	181492	It starts getting to be very in-the-groove level difficulty when you get up pretty high, which on your fingers is... I'm serious.
181672	184492	Some of these steps are just too crazy.
184572	186453	It's like finger-finger mania or something.
187017	187658	I had a... I had a...
208163	209044	Fairly okay time with it.
209504	210785	Screams polished to me.
210985	213888	I hope they don't... No, I think they're going to add more stuff to it.
214008	216210	And I hear it's changing a lot.
216270	218191	Like, you'll notice things get added and disappear.
218311	219953	So I think they're still putting some tweaks on it.
220213	223115	There's probably some more songs that have yet to go into it.
224336	229000	And I imagine... They're probably still trying to figure out what the model's going to be.
229040	237187	I'm pretty sure the game is going to be free, which I hope it is, because I couldn't see myself paying much more than, like, ten bucks for it.
237577	245259	I understand there might be licenses in the game and stuff, but the game itself just not... I mean, how many people play DDR on the PC?
245799	247220	Not enough, in my opinion.
248620	259844	It's really tough when there's a big DDR simulator out there that's free and has thousands upon thousands of tracks freely available out there.
261944	264885	Alright, so anyway, I just wanted to say that.
265525	267426	I got a chance to look at the beta and that's what's going on with it.
268497	269478	Anyway, back to the news.
270439	272340	DarkSakura had brought up Flow for the PlayStation 3.
272961	276143	Another game that was being anticipated for the PlayStation 3 was Warhawk.
276424	288073	Well, there was a rumor, and I emphasize rumor going on right now, that Warhawk could actually turn into a PS3 downloadable title instead, just like a Gran Turismo HD.
288433	291936	And I believe they did confirm saying that it was not canceled.
291956	293017	It was not canceled.
293057	293698	Oh, that's good.
294999	297781	It would be interesting if you have all these games that are kind of going down that path.
298223	299385	PlayStation 3 discs have been dumped to ISOs
313123	318706	Making way for a whole new brand of piracy for the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
319046	324828	PlayStation 3 I can see because it's Blu-ray and the system has a hard drive built into it.
324888	331191	So I'm seeing something pretty similar to what happened with the PlayStation 2 happening with the PlayStation 3.
331611	337394	But right now, Kraken Group Paradox has dumped the first ISO.
337854	341936	Not yet playable, but they've still dumped it and it's only a matter of time.
343178	346120	of MotorStorm, the Japanese ISO for that.
346980	361288	And right now they're saying that the first few sectors of the PlayStation 3 image are special and may contain the decryption keys for the executables, but right now they still haven't figured out exactly how to run stuff yet.
362648	371373	On the other front, though, with the Wii, there's actually been a program released to be able to dump that, and I believe it's two freely available programs
372906	399949	to be able to dump those one of course is called DVD Info Pro that's available out there right now and then there's another program that you use once you have that to raw to dump and they'll dump an image of the Wii DVD but of course once again they haven't figured out how to run those yet either but that's half the battle is dumping the disc and the other half is getting it on there and playing it so it's only a matter of time
400575	404217	So how long before we see fully pirated Wii and PS3 games available on the internet?
404358	405238	Probably a few months.
405338	408280	The Wii's kind of tricky because it's really hard to read those discs.
408760	410081	A normal computer can't read them.
410602	417866	I'm not sure about the Blu-ray ROMs for the PS3, but I know that the Wii ones are pretty hard.
418006	419487	So, I don't know.
419588	419908	We'll see.
420088	421509	Hopefully, I don't know.
421749	429314	Sony's protection in the past has been pretty crappy, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see this stuff pretty soon.
431343	431703	Street Fighter 2
453866	454906	Going on there.
455066	460768	And also a game called Super Probotector, which in the U.S.
460848	464248	is Contra 3, which is so unfair because I want Contra 3.
466629	468389	It's an 800 Wii point game.
470290	470630	Good one.
470690	473671	If you want to check it out, let me know how good it pulls over.
473711	478552	I mean, I've been pleased with everything that's come out for virtual console as far as, I mean, they still have Flickr.
478572	479412	I think it's fantastic.
480552	482033	But those are new ones coming out.
482913	483213	Lucky.
485027	485647	I want Super Contra 3
513502	515763	Virtual Console, that's coming out soon at least.
516244	521867	And then I know they were showing... Well, Kid Icarus was on there a while ago.
521947	522928	Mighty Bomb Jack.
524628	525149	Xevious.
527150	527670	Let's see here.
527710	528771	Jewel Quest 2.
529391	532513	I think that's... Xevious was in last week's releases.
532913	535335	Yeah, that's probably a full game, the Jewel Quest 2 thing.
536695	537516	Let's see here.
540390	541711	What about the Nintendo Originals?
541831	544371	Weren't there supposed to be original virtual console things coming out?
544811	547432	Yeah, wasn't there supposed to be online play as well?
548672	552673	Right, it'll come eventually, like eons away from now.
553193	554273	I guess all in good time.
554793	555193	We'll see.
556734	568156	Well, now, another very interesting story going around about the Wii is that, you know, of course, there's always these, I don't know what you'd call them, parental groups that want to prevent anybody from having fun.
568962	580507	WFAA has put out this thing going out that says that, hey, look, the Wii and the PlayStation 3 can get on the Internet.
580987	586709	Therefore, your kids are accessing pornography through the Wii and the PlayStation 3.
588950	597414	Because, you know, how easy is it that you can go on and you can go click-click on, you know, Pornotube or something and go access some pornography?
598834	604857	I'm actually looking at the website here that says, oh my gosh, these games are internet access.
604877	606238	They're gateways to pornography.
607239	610821	They can play WarioWare, Guitar Hero, because that's what I play on PlayStation 3 as well, and pornography.
612962	614063	I love the pornography game.
614083	615203	There's a quote here in this article.
615464	618145	Quote, they're innocent and we want to try and keep them that way.
618645	620526	It's very upsetting something this popular.
620566	622968	A kid game can go that direction so quickly.
623468	624949	Oh, shut up, stupid kid.
625792	631877	And even in this story, in a blog, one child boasted, the first thing I thought of when I downloaded the Wii browser was also porn.
633138	636360	Yeah, I'm sure it was really a child that was blogging about that shit.
636400	639102	Well, if they were under 18, you'd see a 17-year-old would be considered a child.
639382	644406	Look, it's the same damn thing as the computer, right?
644926	645147	Yeah.
645307	648869	If you have a PC in your house, that is also a gateway to porn.
649330	654834	So monitor your kids' Wii and PS3 use just like you do their PC use.
655754	656094	Duh.
656695	657435	How hard is that?
657555	660037	That kind of pisses me off that people are trying to spin this.
660117	663780	It's like, oh my gosh, the Wii has chicks doing it on it.
664121	667663	Well, that's just like saying, you know, oh, eating McDonald's is going to make you fat.
667803	670786	Then the next week later, oh, eating Burger King is going to make you fat.
670886	673388	Then the next week later, oh, Taco Bell is going to make you fat.
673848	675569	They're all gateways to fatness.
675730	683696	You know, well, it's just fucking stupid bitches that need the fucking attention and they...
685715	688976	Every news outlet seems to do this kind of shit too.
689597	693179	Oh my god, it's because they don't have news and they need something to fill space.
693239	694299	That's what it fucking is.
694920	701583	And if there's another device that comes out there that has the internet on it, oh my god, it's a gateway to porn.
701863	706566	You know what, there's fucking goddamn child safety stuff on there.
706626	712329	They even had the update to block the internet before the internet browser was even available.
712862	716826	and the weather too, because my god, there can be some pornography in the weather.
718507	721630	Oh, I remember that one time there was the topless weather girl on the weather channel.
721890	724672	Well, this is something completely different.
725893	731018	They have, the tools are there for the parents to use, and it's just the parents are being stupid.
731538	732439	And that's all it is.
732799	738264	And because, for one, I mean, pulling up porn on the Wii is fucking slow.
739236	742938	I mean, granted, you can do it, but they have the parental controls on there.
743078	744598	Okay, lots of good comments from chat.
744638	747580	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, live on this Sunday evening on this topic.
747880	752942	DDRDollarBill says, Fuck, the cell phone is the gateway to the internet, thus it can get on porno sites.
753582	756523	James Patrick says, Well, there's porn sites built for the Wii.
757063	759004	Like, people, you know, kind of catering to that whole thing.
759985	761945	And, um, looking at this, well, let's see.
761966	762006	Um...
763752	770899	Blackboy says there are also programs that restrict what websites can be accessed on the computer, but we don't really see anything like that on the Wii yet.
771600	773161	Yeah, it's called the parental controls.
773261	774623	Does that work on websites too?
776024	777425	It blocks the whole internet.
777506	778647	Oh, okay.
779147	779788	Very interesting.
780528	781650	Also, somebody else said here...
782979	787103	S2H makes this groaner These parents are probably the same types who would let people drink two gallons of water in a short time
807233	807793	DarkSakura.com
833382	838005	My FU of the week goes towards distance.
839306	844851	And knowing that two people that I care an awful lot about are separated by it right now.
844871	850895	I really don't know what else to say.
850995	855358	Just, you know, that I hope they hang in there and can't wait to see them together again.
855959	857560	And I'm talking about Chris and Megzi, so.
858981	862304	The official OLR lesbians will be reunited again soon.
862564	862924	I know they will.
863553	863933	Uh, Loki!
864914	870156	Uh, fuck you to your neighbors, because they're dumb little kids that won't fucking get out of the way of cars.
870676	875978	I mean, I'm sitting there trying to park my car, and they're playing football in the middle of the street, in the dark, by the way.
876819	878119	Um, and they won't fucking move.
878680	886063	So, fuck them, and I'm glad I ran over your fucking toy last week, stupid bitches, and I will run you over if you get in my car's way again.
887723	891125	Jvmon in chat's yelling, please tell me Loki ran someone over, please tell me.
891579	895040	Hey, I started with a toy truck, so, uh... It's just the enabler.
896181	907564	Alright, uh, my FU of the week goes to, uh, my office chair, which is now sitting in the corner of the room, broken, because it snapped in two places when my fat ass plopped in it the other day.
907584	915947	Nelly pointed out, though, it's quite funny, because it is now the hoopty chair, because you can sit in, and fuckin' just like, feel, yeah.
915967	919488	You can kinda lean back, cause there's not, yeah, one of the arms is off
919878	923400	But a big thank you to Duct Tape, which I think will fix my chair soon.
923700	928263	Although, DarkSakura did say I could probably get a new one pretty cheap at Ikea, and it would look better than Duct Tape.
928323	929864	And I do love me some Ikea.
930185	931165	I need an excuse to go there.
932166	933046	Ikea is rad.
933327	936208	I recommend, though, Duct Tape might fix DarkSakura's chair.
936849	938030	Lots of Duct Tape.
938370	941392	I've tried to fix this chair with Duct Tape.
941592	943113	We should just cover the whole chair in Duct Tape.
943293	945635	No, because I don't want to be squeaky.
945675	947876	Maybe I'll get another chair soon, but that seems funny.
947916	949237	It sounds like a fart.
950157	951377	Oh, and F you to dental bills.
951817	952277	Oh, God.
952317	956078	I hate when I go to the dentist, I feel like I'm going to a used car salesman.
956098	958619	They're trying to talk me into, like, all this crap I don't need.
958939	963979	And it's like, you know, like, if I don't do it, then, um, frickin', my teeth are all gonna fall out.
963999	964900	And I know that's not true.
964960	966020	They're trying... Give this.
966060	970681	My dentist is trying to get me to upgrade to a $1,000 crown.
971201	972421	A crown that costs $1,000.
972661	974681	Because they say my insurance will only cover a tin can.
975101	976462	Um, I have a $1,000 crown.
976482	976582	But I...
979213	981574	But how much... Did you pay for all of that out of pocket?
982055	983655	Paid $500 of it.
983715	985576	See, my insurance won't pay for any of it.
985636	985916	Sucks.
986297	991419	The whole reason I have the one I did is because it was absolute necessity because it was my back molar that broke.
992120	992860	The root broke.
993560	995001	And I had to have the whole thing filled out.
995061	995501	No, no, no.
995561	996442	That's not my situation.
996522	1002285	See, don't feel bad about having the 10-1 when it could be a little lot worse.
1002925	1003485	Yeah, exactly.
1006567	1006847	Anyway...
1008666	1010307	and I'll see you next time.
1029804	1032325	I need to eat twice the amount of animals to make up for the vegetarians.
1032345	1032505	Anyways.
1059534	1061275	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1080254	1081134	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1105243	1108585	HD DVD sounds like the way it's going to go, at least for the porn industry.
1108705	1111787	So if you have a 360, there you go, some porn.
1112128	1117411	Although I do recommend, though, if you are going to watch porn on the PS3, just dump it to your hard drive.
1119512	1120173	You know what, though?
1120333	1121774	I've got to be honest.
1123595	1126357	If they do go to HD DVD, which it sounds like they're going to do, this is it.
1126417	1126777	It's over.
1127357	1128398	Format Wars are over.
1128818	1131640	That's what ended VHS and beta, when porn went to VHS.
1132418	1132798	I don't know.
1134059	1141924	I think, though, they make a good point that if it's cheaper to produce, then the disc prices are going to be cheaper.
1141964	1146006	But right now, the retail for disc prices isn't any cheaper than Blu-ray.
1146406	1155452	So it comes down to the bottom line of price, what it's going to cost these companies and what kind of a margin they can make on this stuff because it's cheaper to produce for.
1155532	1157013	If it's going to be the same quality...
1158200	1160121	Then, yeah, I think HD DVD is going to win out.
1160161	1162323	This is why I'm simply saying the format wars are over.
1162403	1168707	I don't mean to keep dogging on Sony, but look, the evident... Look, when the porn industry, and, you know, who doesn't love some porn?
1168987	1171849	When they go for HD DVD, that's it.
1171869	1175411	Well, Sony's really kind of known for failed formats anyways.
1175451	1180875	I mean, let's see here, Betamax, UMD... Kick them while they're down, Loki.
1180895	1181635	Kick them while they're down.
1181655	1187099	I mean, hey, you know, I support Sony just as much, but... It's there.
1188317	1188857	Moving on.
1190238	1201183	In New York State, Representative Keith Wright proposed legislation to block the sales of games that depict racist and religious violence to minors.
1202264	1217431	The bill is A00547, and if it passed, it will block the sales of those games that advocate or glamorize violent crime, suicide, sexual violence, violent racism, religious violence, and illegal use of drugs or alcohol.
1218896	1223179	He's also called for retailers to play such games in an adults only section.
1224039	1228001	Retailers would be required to check IDs for buyers under 30.
1233724	1238227	Again, the problem I have with this, who checks what games meet this criteria?
1238347	1240908	What is considered violent?
1240928	1242389	That's why we have the ESRB.
1244150	1247932	I understand that, but I don't like it when I see these bills and they're so vague on
1248291	1252694	We want to put violent games behind a closed curtain.
1252714	1253935	Well, what's a violent game?
1254216	1262822	Well, this one actually has been going a bit more to define it, to define the violence at any rate.
1262942	1276352	However, racism is... I mean, basically anybody can get offended over something if it remotely sounds racist to them, so I don't see how it's, you know... And it works both ways, too.
1276452	1276813	I mean, it...
1279338	1286503	I think that, honestly, again, it's not the place of our government to decide what gets sold to who.
1286943	1292507	I think it's the job of the parents to take a more active role in what their children are playing.
1292567	1299312	Talk to them, look in every so often, but in the end, it's not the place of our government to decide.
1299692	1301333	We already have rating systems.
1301934	1303355	Most retailers already...
1303968	1309670	We can't sell anything that's rated M to a minor, so why is this necessary?
1309750	1311891	All this is is wasting more taxpayer money.
1314612	1316052	If we hadn't done the FUs previously.
1316453	1318273	Alright, anyway, moving on.
1318293	1321074	I want to talk a little bit about PC gaming.
1321134	1325836	Remember, one of our New Year's resolutions was we were going to give some more love to PC gaming, and well,
1326431	1329293	Technically, this is about Mac gaming, but that's okay.
1329313	1330534	You know, PC is personal computer.
1330574	1330975	It's everything.
1331295	1339182	So, some Mac fans are going to be in luck because it sounds like GameTap is planning to port Myst Online over to the Mac.
1340383	1344286	And also, Myst Online is going to be getting a whole new world to explore.
1344666	1348890	It's kind of weird, though, because GameTap is actually not available on the Mac.
1348930	1351712	And a lot of people say that's what's stopping them from getting on GameTap.
1351772	1355495	And, you know, if GameTap could bring their pretty big library over to the Mac, that would be something else.
1355814	1360098	Well, Trans Gaming is going to be the company that's actually going to bring the title over to the Mac.
1360878	1362239	So, that's kind of cool.
1363260	1364341	No release as of yet.
1364421	1365742	It's just announced that it's happening.
1366203	1370506	But those folks who were looking into getting into Myst Online, there you have it.
1370546	1372688	You can do that on the Mac if you are so inclined.
1373689	1374209	There you go.
1375731	1379133	One cool game that's going to be coming to the PC, Monster Hunter.
1379394	1382716	Not a real huge franchise in the United States, but it is pretty big over in Japan.
1383997	1384178	This
1385202	1385922	I like to see that.
1412136	1415438	or even a PlayStation 2 release of the ones that they have in Japan.
1415678	1417399	It was on the PS2 a while back, I think.
1419040	1421341	I'm not sure in the United States, but I know it was in Japan.
1421601	1422842	They've had a few in Japan.
1422862	1424483	I don't know.
1426925	1432068	I think there was the one on PS2 because I remember seeing it at Dan's old store.
1434589	1439692	Well, at any rate, as far as other games, there's a
1440399	1446124	The Battlefield 2142 Northern Strike for the PC being worked on right now.
1446224	1447485	EA has announced it.
1447606	1453931	It's a booster pack being worked on by EA Digital Illusions Studio in Stockholm.
1454292	1455092	Wow, it's Swedish.
1455873	1458235	And it's scheduled for release in March 2007.
1460337	1463119	It's going to be a futuristic conflict game.
1464944	1467247	that's following a second Ice Age.
1467927	1484224	They've released more details on the story, but it's also going to include three new maps, the World War II battle scene at the bridge of Remagen, Alpine, Titan, and a liberation at Leipzig.
1484345	1487508	So it seems like it's got some stuff going on.
1489104	1492207	Although it seems to me most people prefer Battlefield 2 to Battlefield 2142.
1495370	1501534	I played like yay much of Battlefield 2 and decided it wasn't my kind of game, but have you played a little more of this, Loki?
1501855	1502015	Nope.
1502595	1503656	Oh, I thought you had for some reason.
1504117	1508620	Oh, I had it for free, and I don't try to play too much PC stuff.
1508720	1511002	In fact, the last PC game I played was Oblivion.
1511442	1512884	I loaded it on there, and...
1514610	1516571	My laptop barely runs it.
1516671	1517771	It doesn't really like it too much.
1518152	1522553	But I played with a lot of cheat devices running at the same time, so I have my super-powered character.
1523414	1535639	So it was fun going around and killing people from long distances away, unlocking spells that were just in there for test purposes, and just plainly exerting my force over the citizens of a town.
1535699	1536519	That's what I like.
1536739	1538200	Why aren't you playing more PC games?
1538400	1539780	I need to play more Fable.
1541121	1542361	That's not really a PC game, though.
1542381	1543802	Why aren't you playing more PC games?
1544210	1548692	because my PC's old and because also I just don't have the time for it.
1549332	1551213	I mean, I just don't have the time for it.
1551233	1554534	You know, wife doesn't like playing games.
1554774	1557435	Well, maybe there'd be a PC game she likes.
1557655	1559276	Desperate Housewives of the Game came out, didn't it?
1560076	1560977	Should buy that for her.
1561377	1562157	See if the wife likes that.
1562938	1568000	No, but that reminds me, though, I should probably load up The Sims 2 again so I can kill more Sims.
1568720	1571361	Oh, and maybe get Sims 2 Pets so I can kill animals, too.
1573001	1577907	Alright, well, um... I wonder if you should... Too bad you can't make them drink lots of water.
1578468	1578948	Stop it.
1579088	1581111	Moving back to the console world.
1582232	1589440	You know, folks that have 360s that are on their last legs don't really want to have to send that back if they cannot help it.
1589761	1592945	Kotaku ran an interesting story earlier this week about an old...
1593561	1593901	DarkSakura.com
1624681	1630025	Instead of using a heat gun, you're using the heat coming off the CPU because you're wrapping it up in the towels.
1630365	1631125	It's not a good idea.
1631506	1632586	Just put it that way.
1632626	1633687	It's not a good idea to do it.
1633887	1634428	Why?
1634868	1647256	Because before the thought was that they were overheating because the contact between the heat sink and the actual processor, whatever they put in there, wasn't fully melted all the way.
1647716	1653720	And so using the heat gun, you would melt that so it would have a better contact with the heat sink and it would cause it to not overheat.
1654315	1662001	Well, by wrapping this whole thing in a towel, you may be, you know, duplicating that, but at the same time, you're overheating everything else and causing stuff to break.
1662121	1671109	So, in a sense, I guess, if you have the Three Rings of Death already, you might as well give it a shot because it's not going to hurt nothing, but, I mean... Not going to help it either.
1671149	1672290	It's not going to probably help it either.
1672350	1676854	Well, JeremyTaw1 says, on the IGM message board, someone tried the towel trick and they said it actually worked.
1677474	1679436	ActDeft says, hey, I got the Three Rings of Death.
1679676	1680677	Just hit your 360.
1680717	1681317	It really works.
1682859	1683279	And, um...
1685730	1687411	Just give your 360 a lot of water.
1691274	1691995	Submerge it.
1692535	1693696	Topic change, please.
1694076	1695817	Submerge it into the ocean.
1695857	1696838	Topic change, please.
1697118	1701741	Anyway, speaking of funny, crazy stuff, let's talk about our friend Ken Kutaragi.
1702502	1703322	Crayon Man!
1703462	1705964	In 2006, he had a lot of crazy things to say.
1706484	1709747	All the more reason, I think, that, you know, we should really get him to stop talking.
1709887	1710047	But...
1711279	1717346	There is actually a website that compiled a pretty interesting list of his quotes, PS3 Today.
1717966	1723612	And so we thought we would share some of them with you and maybe have some discussion about how crazy he is.
1724393	1727736	First off, the PlayStation 3 is not a game machine.
1728257	1729318	That was a quote from him.
1730119	1731800	So, not a game machine.
1731941	1733102	I guess it's a computer.
1734023	1734283	Anyways...
1735419	1744583	Being us for a short moment is like accidentally winning a point from a sheer hand, Karate Master, and Microsoft is still not a black belt.
1745103	1752046	Just like with their operating systems, they might come out with something good around the third generation of their release.
1753107	1754367	So, I don't get that.
1754387	1755228	That doesn't make any sense.
1757229	1757789	Let's see here.
1757829	1758689	Oh, this one's kind of funny.
1758989	1760670	Microsoft shoots for the moon.
1760690	1762311	Did you just say Microsoft?
1764081	1766542	We're all having talking problems.
1766702	1767643	See, I can't even talk.
1767963	1770145	We're all having talking problems.
1770245	1771526	It's in the water in this town.
1771846	1775609	The water not only is killing people, but it's making people stupid.
1776269	1779452	Anyways, Microsoft shoots for the moon, Sony shoots for the sun.
1781993	1782394	Okay.
1783314	1788478	It says, this time Microsoft has stated clearly that it's going after the PlayStation.
1788851	1792953	However, they're going after the, not after the PlayStation 3, but the PlayStation 2.
1793934	1797876	They were looking at 2, and that's why Xbox 360 became like that.
1798977	1803600	So it's like, because it's the second console from them, they're going after the second console from Sony?
1804140	1805861	Yeah, no, that doesn't make any sense either.
1807062	1815186	With PlayStation, or the PlayStation 3, our intentions have been to create a machine with supercomputer calculation capabilities for home entertainment.
1816807	1817508	Okay.
1817988	1818208	All right.
1819400	1821821	PlayStation 3 will instill discipline in our children and adults alike.
1822101	1824282	Everyone will know discipline.
1847435	1848755	DarkSakura's website of the week.
1848775	1851696	She serves the internet up and down and left and right and back and forth and...
1874173	1874934	All over the place.
1874994	1880359	In fact, I hear there's 13 different ways she can hold her internet, including the mortar and pestle.
1880899	1886104	And she finds a website that she likes and shares it all with you here on our program.
1886124	1887545	It's called DarkSakura's Website of the Week.
1891188	1891648	See?
1891808	1892769	It's something in the water.
1893310	1894171	I don't drink the water, though.
1894211	1895532	I had coffee.
1895552	1897333	Coffee is made of water, stupid.
1897734	1899155	I didn't use tap water, though.
1900532	1901273	I used filtered water.
1901293	1903314	I filter all the stupid out of it.
1903414	1903794	Whatever.
1904114	1909518	Anyway, the website of the week is YouParkLikeAnAsshole.com Best site ever.
1910538	1914741	This site actually has downloadable stickers.
1914881	1915862	Or not stickers, but...
1917219	1923421	Notices that you can leave on people's cars, like in Fraction 1 and Fraction 2.
1923781	1925682	They're available in a PDF format.
1926062	1928563	And you can leave them on cars that you see parked badly.
1929083	1934465	As in double parking, being too close to the line to where no one can get out of the car next to them.
1935705	1946669	And the best thing about that is that it has check marks that you can put on there to say, like, listed two spots, one car, a little too close, too far away from the driveway.
1947079	1957187	Too close to my driveway, over the painted lines, diagonal parking, cool car, diagonal parking, not so cool car, move up, that's a compact, and others so that you can walk it in.
1958248	1964292	And there's a disclaimer that says, parking is far too limited in our overcrowded streets and parking lots, and you happen to park like an asshole.
1964713	1967915	Go to the above website to see why someone else thought you parked like an asshole.
1968216	1971999	Don't be too offended, we all do it at one time or another, it just so happens that you got caught.
1973219	1976142	Dude, Jamie, I'll give you a quarter to leave one on extra first car.
1977671	1978572	Dude, I'd do it for free.
1980034	1980795	What was I going to say?
1981015	1983097	And you can also send pictures to the site, too.
1983117	1985100	They need the one that's like four corners.
1985200	1990406	It's where you park in four spaces at once, you know, like just down the center of the crossing.
1990746	1991487	I'm going to go to the site.
1991527	1994030	Look, I have a little printer right here, a little cheap-ass $30 printer.
1994050	1994971	I'm going to go to the site.
1995663	2001284	First thing, when I can, when this show's done, I'm going to print some out and carry them around in my car, and I'll let you know how many I use.
2001304	2007725	Actually, yesterday, when I was getting sushi, there were these people who were just parked... I mean, really freaking parked badly.
2007805	2010406	Like, the line was in the middle of both of their cars, yeah?
2010446	2013947	Well, how about they need one on there that says, this is not a parking spot, you know?
2014027	2017967	It's, like, in the middle of the road, or, like, double parked, or just wherever.
2019388	2020388	Well, also, you can...
2021138	2021799	Well, this is what I did.
2021959	2025161	I actually just hand wrote notes and left diagrams pointing the proper way to park.
2025722	2027523	And the first one says, you park like an idiot.
2027603	2029324	You learn how to do this when you're a teenager.
2029384	2030085	Don't do it again.
2030445	2032046	And the other one was, you park like you're retarded.
2032086	2032927	Get back on the short bus.
2035349	2038671	What if the person really was mentally challenged?
2038771	2040393	Then they don't need to be driving.
2041173	2043255	But this person was triple parked.
2043355	2044296	I kid you not.
2045036	2046177	Not even for legitimate reasons.
2046217	2047158	It was at a restaurant.
2047826	2050587	Real quick here, I got one more Ken Kutaragi quote.
2051087	2051827	I missed this one.
2051887	2060948	It says, if processors of high performance and wide bandwidth like the cell were linked together without sufficient security, a worldwide system crash could occur with one attack.
2062169	2064709	Is there a site called YouTalkLikeAnAsshole.com?
2066069	2066389	I don't know.
2069170	2071250	Speaking of assholes, here's one in training.
2072130	2075631	Apparently a nine-year-old child stole their neighbor's car.
2076500	2081085	got spotted by police on the interstate, guns it to a 90-mile-an-hour chase.
2081765	2088391	The kid tried to take an exit ramp, but the engine blew and the car hit a curb, went into a tree, and the kid gets captured.
2088772	2091194	How the hell did a 9-year-old learn to drive a car?
2091354	2098561	I had to do so many loops in the parking lot at my high school with the driver's ed instructor before I was ever able to figure out how to drive.
2098741	2099422	Same way I did.
2099642	2100443	Ridge Racer!
2101952	2113199	Well, yeah, you're not helping much because apparently, according to what was going on, is that the mom believed that PlayStation taught him how to do all this.
2113840	2119625	So apparently either Grand Theft Auto or Ridge Racer, this is where he learned to drive and do all this and hightail it to get away from the cops.
2119865	2121226	You're not helping, DarkSakura.
2121246	2122427	Well, did you see the other part of this?
2122447	2124329	But they don't have accurate driving simulators.
2124429	2125810	I think it was arcade games that did it.
2126010	2127211	It's all Gran Turismo's fault.
2127271	2130594	Did you see the real driving simulator?
2130614	2139281	Anyways, did you see the rest of the story where they were talking about how he, before that, also recently evaded airport security, managing the hop-up flight?
2139621	2142083	No, they're trying to turn it into Chuck Norris.
2142163	2142483	Come on.
2142523	2143404	Oh, that'd be funny, Chris.
2145310	2152071	See, that'd be cool if he actually did that, because, you know, I'd give props to the kid, but, um... Yeah, I think, though, seriously... Props to the kid?
2152171	2155132	That's my tax dollars paying to bust his ass.
2155192	2155832	Fuck that.
2155892	2156632	Put him in juvie.
2157273	2163014	No, props to the kid, because the parents should get, you know, fucking billed or something for this shit.
2163134	2165894	I absolutely agree the parents should be billed for it all.
2165914	2168535	My tax dollars should not go to pay for this stupid kid.
2170529	2172571	Don't let little Billy in the goddamn car.
2172651	2173792	It's a gateway to porn.
2174092	2175814	He can drive to a porno show.
2175834	2177416	Where did he learn to steal a car?
2178437	2180999	In a video game, you press X to steal the car.
2181360	2183462	You did not go through the whole process.
2183522	2184442	He didn't steal a car.
2184543	2185423	Here's what happened.
2185504	2187986	Little fucking mommy went into the store.
2188066	2189107	Billy, stay in the car.
2189127	2190108	I'm going to leave it running.
2190488	2192170	Got in the driver's seat and drove off.
2192230	2192931	That's what happened.
2192951	2194072	It said it was the neighbor's car.
2195279	2196940	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2218194	2221716	Apparently there's been some screenshots where pedestrians have been spotted.
2221856	2226518	I can only hope that that were the case, but unfortunately I'm thinking this is from some sort of cutscene in the game.
2227318	2233601	But if there's pedestrians and I can hit them going 200 miles an hour, that sold the game twice to me right there.
2233761	2234341	Seriously.
2234641	2235021	Me too.
2235261	2242044	I'm like, seriously, if there's actually pedestrians on the road that run away from your car and stuff, oh my god, did I just buy this game like three times.
2242905	2243585	I'm all, because...
2244364	2246045	Burnout is so hot to begin with.
2246225	2247446	It's one of my favorite racers.
2247506	2248366	It really is awesome.
2248626	2249427	Except for the soundtracks.
2249707	2250888	That's why I love 360.
2250928	2252969	You can just change out the soundtrack.
2253649	2254069	Oh, man.
2254289	2260313	I want an adult-only game where I can blow these people.
2260553	2264615	I want to see blood splatters and skull fragments shattering into my window.
2266041	2266882	That'd be awesome.
2267042	2277268	You know, seriously, I think if, you know, especially with Rockstar and the next Grand Theft Auto game, hell, just go adult only and just fucking go crazy.
2277508	2278609	Go fucking nuts.
2278909	2281071	Just have a normal, like, do like movies.
2281091	2283872	You know, have a rated version of the game and have the underrated.
2284233	2295480	You know, that way you can still sell as many copies and, you know, some people will buy the underrated where you can fucking blow people up and have skull fragments, you know, slam into your car.
2296178	2301421	It'd be cool, though, if the skull fragments could impale other people and embed in their skulls and kill them.
2302521	2302822	Yeah.
2303242	2304122	That'd be fantastic.
2305243	2305523	Anyway.
2305783	2306704	You guys are morbid.
2307244	2307924	I am not!
2308225	2311987	I would love to read some chat comments right now, but I just totally got booted from chat.
2312027	2314608	I pinged out, so... I'll read chat comments!
2314648	2315789	Thank you, is there anything interesting?
2316029	2317449	DarkSakura is awesome.
2318630	2319651	Real ones, please.
2321892	2323933	They're just saying a yay burnout.
2325203	2327224	and Red Asphalt, someone said.
2328725	2329365	Ouch.
2331666	2347354	But moving on to the next story, speaking of fun violence, we have Calling All Cars, formerly known as Criminal Crackdown, which is supposed to be a mix of stuff like Bomberman and Twisted Metal and Demolition Derby.
2347975	2352219	with explosions and crashes and criminals and crashes and more crashes and more crashes.
2352459	2354340	It kind of looks like Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2.
2354621	2354921	I know.
2354981	2358524	It has that same sort of... Well, it's more of a diagonally overhead view, I think.
2359905	2366330	But Sony Computer Entertainment is saying that it would be out by March.
2367231	2369773	So let's hope so.
2369913	2371014	That looks kind of fun to me.
2371655	2373156	I love exploding stuff.
2375329	2376410	I love the description here.
2376490	2380971	It says Tom and Jerry type violence with mass destruction.
2384153	2384433	Hmm.
2384833	2385593	Sounds interesting.
2387054	2387374	All right.
2387714	2393756	Well, we're going to take your calls pretty soon on our Skype line, which is 1-877-GAME-OLR, or the username is Skype.
2394056	2398238	But one other thing that that phone line can be used for is to leave voicemails when we're not here.
2398638	2403200	And we like to play some of our favorite voicemails on the air when you...
2404056	2414340	We like to play some of our favorite voicemails on the air when we're not able to take your calls live.
2414680	2416321	And we're going to play some of those voicemails right now.
2416341	2418602	We've got some really good ones from the last couple shows.
2418962	2420463	So here's our first voicemail.
2420503	2421423	This one's about two minutes.
2422543	2424324	Hi, this is Razorburn2021.
2424384	2426765	I wanted to make some comments on last week's show.
2426845	2428386	I just got done with my weekly listen and...
2429397	2438163	Paradox Vincent's call about Wii Sports kind of got me thinking about a problem I've been having for the last couple of gens with Nintendo product.
2438223	2446109	It's one of the things that's kind of held me back from really getting into, and it's kind of a Nintendo fanaticism.
2447029	2453694	Guys like Paradox Vincent, you know, if you can't look at a game like Wii Sports, I mean, like,
2454602	2455522	I'm huge.
2455783	2460504	I've really, really enjoyed Gears of War, but I can look at it and see why there are people that won't like it.
2461065	2465326	I can see why people would see it's boring or that it just doesn't have the flair they're looking for.
2465386	2474570	If you can't look at Wii Sports and see why a critic would bash it, I think you've really kind of let yourself get a little too into Nintendo.
2474590	2480292	There's this feeling out there that Nintendo can do no wrong, and I think Graybush, when you had your interview, touched on a little bit that
2481464	2494831	Most systems have fans that are way, way, way harder on their games than Nintendo because I think right now Wii fanatics are kind of really thirsty for every game to be, specifically the Nintendo titles, to be a huge success.
2495872	2502716	I've heard stories from most podcasts I listen to about, well, over the holidays I took it and my grandma wanted to play Wii Sports.
2503656	2507118	I've heard that a lot, but how many of your grandmas really are going out and buying a Wii?
2507935	2511116	You know, you say, well, Grandma came over and she wanted to talk to me about Wii Bowling.
2511236	2518699	I mean, how many grandmas are sitting around the hair parlor and saying, well, Edith, last week I played Wii Bowling.
2519079	2521860	Gaming has come a long way, but I don't think it's come a long way.
2522480	2526662	Sure, your grandpa will play Wii Sports with you, but I don't think, you know, he was a nom.
2526682	2528162	He's not going to sit down and play Elements.
2528722	2533364	I think that what you need to be able to see both sides of an argument to really be a gamer.
2534384	2535665	And I think if you're really looking at
2536624	2539847	I'm being kind of rambly now, and now my call's gone too long, so I'm just going to let you go.
2539867	2540208	Love you.
2561647	2562868	Well, thank you very much for the voicemail.
2562908	2564029	We appreciate it.
2564349	2565751	You know, it's kind of interesting.
2567392	2571736	I'm kind of trying to think back to the show when that was taped and kind of everything that we said that was going on there.
2571756	2576540	And, you know, I think, you know, I don't think it's necessarily that Nintendo can do no wrong.
2576581	2580564	Because certainly, you know, at least us here in studio pointed out many faults that Nintendo's done.
2580604	2583006	And, you know, we were just making fun of Red Steel earlier.
2583046	2584508	Although, granted, that's a third-party title.
2584548	2586449	But, you know, most people would say, hey, it's a mistake.
2586490	2587951	Nintendo's not online right now.
2588271	2588951	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2611141	2611702	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2623027	2625068	Hey guys, this is Mr. Wonderful from the forums.
2650580	2656285	I just wanted to chime in with what Sky was saying on the most recent show about gaming journalism being in for a rude awakening.
2656786	2657627	I couldn't agree more.
2657907	2670899	I'm a gaming journalist myself, and for too long the gaming journalism community has really just been focusing on what they perceive to be hardcore and trying to tell the community about what's new and hardcore and underground, but they're a mainstream publication.
2670919	2672701	They need to appeal to all walks of life.
2673021	2675904	They need to appeal to the gaming public as a whole, not just niches.
2676604	2679626	So I think that the Wii is going to provide a huge awakening.
2679687	2682369	It's going to provide a revolution, if you will, of this community.
2682909	2690836	Because journalists can't just say, you know, Gears of War is the greatest game ever because, you know, Cliffy B made it and all this.
2691236	2695239	There's a lot of new gamers out there who don't know who Cliffy B is and probably don't care.
2695699	2702085	They're going to have to start covering a wider range of topics and they're going to have to start backing up claims.
2702245	2703286	I think we're going to see a new...
2704119	2705540	A new age of gaming magazines.
2705580	2708301	They can't just keep continuing on the path they're on.
2708801	2714304	This huge audience that Nintendo's got is not going to be buying their magazines if they don't understand a damn word of them.
2715064	2719086	So, yeah, I agree pretty much wholeheartedly with what you're saying.
2719546	2723728	It's going to be an interesting time for journalism as well as gaming, and I can't wait to see where it goes.
2723788	2728210	But if somebody doesn't pick up on this trend that there's non-gamers that are gaming now,
2728925	2753126	then I don't think they're going to get into it whereas if there is a magazine out there that caters to this idea that people who haven't played games and don't know as much about the history or the culture of gaming and you know, kind of a my first gaming magazine if you will I think something like that could have huge success so I'd really like to see something like that happen great show and keep up the great work looking forward to the next one take it easy guys
2753834	2755415	Thank you very much for the voicemail, we appreciate it
2770014	2794812	because people usually buy magazines for their hobbies and the things they're really into so I don't know if necessarily a casual gaming magazine would sell but I kind of go back to something I had referenced on a particular show where I said magazines like Entertainment Weekly and so on need to expand on their gaming sections and magazines that are dedicated to entertainment and those types of things in general should look at these things from a casual game perspective.
2796813	2797374	That was my thought.
2798194	2799095	Anything else you guys want to add?
2800455	2805378	DJ Morpheus in chat says, why doesn't OLR play hate voicemails?
2805418	2806379	Because everyone loves us.
2806399	2807460	We don't get hate voicemails.
2807480	2807980	Start sending them in.
2808000	2809021	Yeah, call and leave us some.
2809041	2809301	I don't know.
2809321	2809761	No, we're not going to
2829081	2831324	We'd listen to them and get a chuckle out of it and then we'd delete it.
2832546	2832987	Let's see.
2834269	2835390	James Patrick has a good comment.
2835671	2837654	Saying Nintendo fans are crazy is stupid.
2838054	2838776	Madden fans.
2838936	2839817	GTA fans.
2839897	2841139	A lot of fans are just as bad.
2841159	2842000	Interesting.
2843242	2843583	Interesting.
2845455	2847376	Alright, well, oh, this is interesting.
2847617	2849058	SSJ100Matt has an interesting comment.
2849398	2852000	Some Nintendo fanboys are getting as bad as Scientologists.
2852240	2857024	When someone says something bad about it, they go on the offensive, like the Zelda 8.8 rating.
2857124	2859505	I agree, people got their panties way too ruffled over that one.
2859545	2869153	I mean, people in general should just realize it's just some dude's opinion who happens to work for a big website that all you people visit.
2870133	2875017	I don't know why, but you do, and you apparently listen to what they have to say, but in the end, it's just one dude's opinion.
2875871	2876131	Right?
2877692	2879553	That's how you look around.
2880114	2883916	What makes these people any more qualified than you, you, or me?
2884696	2884897	Huh?
2885577	2890640	I mean, I realize they went to journalism school, they know how to write, and they have a love of games, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and all that stuff.
2890900	2891140	Great.
2891661	2893402	But, you know, I have a love of games.
2894022	2897284	You that listened and downloaded this video game podcast has a love of games.
2898645	2902367	Okay, so these guys know their spelling and their grammar and how to write a good review.
2902927	2903328	That's about it.
2904626	2910670	It doesn't always mean... I mean, I don't think, to be honest, a lot of these people have gone to journalism school.
2911690	2917793	I think they're just being hired, so... I could almost... In fact, I know for a fact not all of them have.
2918274	2919214	I know that for a fact.
2920955	2921195	Oh, well.
2922516	2923096	That's what we got.
2923997	2924477	Any more news?
2926398	2927999	Yes, we definitely have some new stuff.
2929300	2931661	So, this was pretty exciting.
2931721	2933222	All week long, they've been kind of...
2933814	2934374	Ghostbusters Zootfly
2960289	2987312	and right now on top of the Ghostbusters game Zoop Fly is also working on another game called Time Zero and it's basically it's kind of related to Ghostbusters a little bit talks about two adventurers who are diehard New Yorkers and they get trapped in a deep like the shadow world of a parallel New York and the city itself is actually a war machine threatening to wipe out the world and they have three days to stop it so
2988175	2988835	That's kind of neat.
2988915	2989555	They're working on that.
2989575	2996857	And I know they're also working on another game called Toy Wars, which is coming to the Xbox Live Arcade, which looks pretty cool, too.
2997117	3003419	So hopefully people, you know, so far the response has been pretty good on it.
3003659	3006259	And a lot of fans want to see this thing made.
3006299	3010620	So hopefully a publisher jumps on this and gets a license he writes paid for.
3010760	3013781	And hopefully we see this game come to fruition.
3016702	3016982	All right.
3017728	3024193	Well, that sounds pretty cool, and I like that screenshot of the toy game that you showed me, and that's kind of cool.
3024213	3024314	Yeah.
3024374	3025394	Is this something you'll probably buy?
3026195	3026596	It would be.
3027096	3028397	I like Ghostbusters.
3028437	3029098	I think it'd be fun.
3029478	3030499	Will it have the song in it?
3030519	3031299	That's all I want to know.
3031840	3033301	Actually, the song is different.
3033321	3038245	They have a rock version of it in the video that they were showing, so I liked it.
3038305	3039186	I thought it was pretty cool.
3039486	3040207	All right, very cool.
3041178	3044840	Alright, well, this is the point of the show where we're going to open up the Skype line.
3044880	3053465	If you want to give us a call, our username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, or you can give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, which is toll free in the US and Canada.
3053925	3065651	Sorry, UK folks and those in other countries, whether it be Australia, wherever you're at, you'll have to use the old-fashioned method of calling us on Skype, which I guess isn't really old-fashioned, but for us it is.
3065951	3066712	Let's go to the phones.
3067612	3068873	I'm getting a lot of calls tonight already.
3069575	3070517	We are the gateway to porn
3084028	3089972	By the way, I just want to say, before we start getting into this, I want to say, Rob D's quality is like perfect right now.
3090052	3092973	I'm loving this call because I don't hear myself echoing in the background.
3093094	3093614	No static.
3093794	3095135	No static.
3095175	3096235	His volume is perfect.
3096616	3098697	This is a model phone call, boys and girls.
3098757	3099758	I applaud you.
3099958	3101198	You have a good enunciation.
3101258	3101539	I do.
3101599	3106842	I applaud you, Rob D. Not to knock on the other callers because I realize it's internet radio and what have you.
3107487	3111089	Rob D, whatever you've done to set yourself up, you need to share that with everybody.
3111689	3112109	It's great.
3112150	3112510	Sounds great.
3112550	3115611	All right, so the Wii porn story, what do you want to say?
3116712	3120194	All right, so basically, I don't know if you actually covered this.
3120434	3125977	I unfortunately was watching part of the Colts game, so I was kind of halfway listening to OLR.
3126137	3126677	We forgive you.
3127237	3127938	Yeah, I'm sorry.
3128818	3134641	Okay, so I don't know if you covered this, but did you read the quote from A Supposed Child where he said,
3135165	3138467	The first thing I did when I got the Wii was think about porn or something like that.
3138547	3141549	Yeah, something that the website had got from their blog.
3141629	3146673	They went and looked at a blog and said, hey, one child said on their blog that the first thing I thought about when I got the Wii was porn.
3147693	3149054	Or the Wii, no, it was the Wii browser.
3149094	3151055	First thing I thought about when the Wii browser was porn.
3152096	3153217	So I was curious about that.
3153297	3157580	Since it mentioned that it was a blog, I plugged the quote into Google just to see where it was from.
3158800	3159981	Ah, good thinking, my friend.
3160021	3160782	Where did it come from?
3161782	3163283	It's from a post on Haku.
3163744	3164064	On where?
3164084	3164164	Haku.
3164656	3165156	Kotaku.
3165516	3165937	Really?
3166417	3167978	It was a comment to some random article.
3168018	3168758	I forget what it was.
3168838	3170759	Oh, I thought you were going to say MySpace.
3174541	3178243	Well, okay, that's interesting because then how would they know that it was a child?
3178263	3181565	Because Kotaku's commenting system doesn't tell a person their age, right?
3182206	3184247	Well, here's what's actually funny about this.
3184807	3191190	The comment immediately preceding that quote was, as a male aged 18 to 35.
3192131	3194032	And I kid you not, that's exactly what it was.
3195416	3195676	Huh.
3197378	3199319	And he is quoted as a child in that article.
3200420	3200821	Interesting.
3200841	3202922	So they're totally stretching the facts and stuff.
3203123	3203623	Not surprising.
3203643	3209788	I'll find the quote on Google, or I'll find the webpage and shove it in chat just to verify that.
3209808	3211009	I'm not pulling this out of nowhere.
3211210	3211810	No, I believe you.
3211830	3212691	I'm pulling the gross horse in there.
3212891	3214953	I believe the power of Google is an amazing thing.
3216334	3217435	But that's kind of funny.
3217495	3219837	I just thought that how, that the fact that they...
3220540	3221041	DarkSakura.com
3228103	3232905	Yeah, and this is almost as good as that one article a year ago about how the PSP pulls porn out of thin air.
3233165	3237227	Oh, some folks in chat don't know what Kotaku is, so we should say it's a big gaming blog.
3237607	3243549	If you know Destructoid or even like IGN and GameSpot's news feed, it's very similar.
3243569	3244930	It's just a game blog.
3244950	3247691	You can put an RSS in your reader and get all their news and stuff.
3247711	3248951	That's what Kotaku is.
3249532	3251072	Sorry, I'm sorry, what was the other thing you were saying?
3252213	3257795	I was saying it's almost as good as the article from about a year ago when it said that the PSP was...
3258496	3260737	or no, if the PSP pulled porn out of thin air.
3261997	3263437	It just made up porn.
3264177	3264598	Exactly.
3264838	3269339	Hey, dude, if the PS3 would pull porn out of thin air, I'd buy it.
3270039	3270919	Only no Blu-ray doesn't.
3271959	3273020	Yeah, now we do.
3273700	3282042	It actually reminds me of the story where we had the DS, and remember the one TV news station did a story about child predators on the DS in PictoChat?
3285014	3285935	That's what it reminds me of.
3286035	3287716	Too many penis drawings?
3287736	3294980	No, the fact that, oh my gosh, your four-year-old might be playing on the Nintendo DS and a child predator could write something sexual on it.
3295581	3300904	But what people forget is that if somebody's doing that, that person is in the room with you.
3301104	3304046	Those DSs do not have that huge a range.
3305767	3306047	I don't know.
3307236	3308517	All right, well, anyway, that's all I have to say.
3308537	3310018	That's what was going on at E3 a couple years ago.
3310258	3310919	Well, that's different.
3310939	3311539	That's E3.
3311900	3313861	You put all the nerds in a room and that's what's going to happen.
3313901	3315562	All right, Rob D., we appreciate the call.
3315582	3316923	I tossed a link in chat, by the way.
3316943	3317024	What?
3317044	3317304	What's that?
3317724	3318665	I tossed a link in chat.
3318905	3319305	Oh, great.
3319325	3319646	Thank you.
3320006	3320887	We'll take a look at that.
3321567	3322848	Anyway, thanks for taking my call.
3322908	3323468	See you guys later.
3323569	3324049	No problem.
3324089	3324709	Have a good one, buddy.
3324970	3325530	Thanks for the call.
3326431	3327692	Model OLR phone call.
3327732	3332956	Yes, it looks like, of course, since I said that, he did cut out a couple times during the call, but that's just probably our connection.
3333196	3336679	That's all the people playing fucking World of Warcraft in the other room that's causing that.
3336699	3337059	That's what's...
3337469	3337969	That's what's up.
3339590	3340430	Let's go to another call.
3340470	3341611	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3341651	3342031	Who's this?
3343552	3346013	It's everyone's favorite caller, Raven's Dolphin.
3346313	3347734	Oh, Raven's Dolphin.
3347874	3350575	What can we do for you this week, buddy?
3352236	3353216	Absolutely nothing.
3353256	3357878	I just want to comment on the Wii thing and the PSP thing.
3358679	3359799	I just have to say this first.
3359839	3364001	You're becoming quite the famous little caller of Internet radio programs, I'm noticing.
3365931	3367332	Yeah, I figured that.
3367572	3368773	You should start your own show.
3372315	3376598	Not that I'm discouraging you from calling into programs, but it's obvious you have a lot to say.
3377098	3382041	And if we haven't proven this fact, any schmo with a microphone can do a show.
3382901	3383762	You should think about it.
3385692	3386552	I was thinking about it.
3386672	3388113	I'm definitely thinking about it.
3388433	3392853	It's just the thing about is money, and can I keep it going for an hour?
3393114	3393614	You know what?
3393634	3397714	DJ Morpheus says, how about a show of clips of him just calling into other shows?
3397734	3398575	That's a brilliant idea.
3399495	3400315	All right.
3400535	3401715	I'm just fucking with you, Raven's Dolphin.
3401735	3402515	What's on your mind, really?
3402555	3402936	I'm sorry.
3404776	3409837	I just want to say that I watched that clip with the Wii, you know, when they talk about the Wii for porn.
3410339	3416040	The two little girls that had the Wii, they took them and I pushed pause and they didn't even have the internet browser.
3416060	3417721	I don't think they even have internet at all.
3418661	3425902	Oh, so like you watched the clip, like on the TV site you watched a clip of the girls playing with the Wii and they didn't even have the internet channel on it.
3427442	3428663	They didn't even have it on.
3428703	3432203	They went to the news show, like, look, it's a game with the porn.
3432343	3434684	I don't even think they even have internet.
3435239	3438882	You know, you have to download it off the Wii, but you have to download it off the Wii Channel.
3438902	3440804	There's so many different things you have to do.
3440824	3442865	I don't think people realize that.
3442966	3447229	Your quality is kind of screwing up there, buddy, but yeah, you know what?
3447389	3448811	Damn the media for doing that.
3448891	3450472	They're just looking for something.
3450832	3452974	Yeah, I just feel like TV's just failing me now.
3479212	3486676	Well, you know, you always, you have to take some of the things that you hear on the news with a grain of salt, unfortunately, especially these types of investigation stories.
3486716	3494921	I mean, it's one thing to report on a fire that's, you know, engulfed an entire neighborhood or whatever, and it's another thing to report on these types of moral issues, right?
3496582	3497202	All right.
3497442	3500384	I'm hoping to get a live 365 stream soon.
3500464	3501604	It's just a matter of money.
3502004	3502285	All right.
3502325	3506587	Well, good luck to you, Raven Stolfen, and you know, if you get your own show, we got your back.
3508208	3508768	Oh, thank you.
3508828	3510429	And I, you know, I have your back too.
3510829	3511109	All right.
3511149	3511449	We know.
3511689	3512390	Have a good one, buddy.
3513650	3513990	You too.
3514030	3514250	Bye.
3514330	3514630	Later.
3515451	3515811	All right.
3516211	3517731	Um, let's, oops, did I just hang up on someone else?
3517891	3518992	Okay, let's go.
3520112	3521513	Our phone lines are open.
3521853	3524414	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3524474	3525754	You can always call us on Skype.
3525794	3528175	Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.
3528535	3530336	Does anybody have any last minute stories real quick?
3530756	3532097	Uh, interject here in between some calls.
3532857	3533097	Yeah.
3533457	3535338	Um, just a couple things real quick.
3535778	3535878	Um,
3536676	3564981	Mega Man Star Force is actually getting a pretty cool peripheral for the DS and it's actually some sort of almost like the card scanning system that they had for Animal Crossing and some other stuff before so you can actually plug that in and scan your Mega Man cards to be able to play in the role playing game as well so that's kind of neat and then Eidos has a
3566135	3570196	Grab the rights for Daffy Duck and The O.C.
3570417	3572717	So we're going to see some crappy games based on that.
3572977	3573678	The O.C.?
3573718	3574218	But The O.C.
3574258	3574858	canceled.
3575018	3575458	I don't get it.
3575798	3577939	All the perfect time to make a game.
3577959	3579280	We're getting another call real quick.
3579300	3579920	Let's go to this one.
3579940	3581020	This is a conference.
3581560	3584742	I'm a little worried about this one, but I guess we'll pick this up anyway.
3585142	3588043	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, and I'm speaking to two people?
3589243	3590424	No, I don't know what you're talking about.
3590464	3591744	My Skype's being glitchy.
3591964	3593765	Okay, well, what's up, DMN?
3593805	3594425	What's on your mind?
3595239	3595659	Not much.
3596139	3597480	I'm calling to defend WarioWare.
3598040	3600620	Okay, oh yes, because, well, I didn't give it a negative review.
3600660	3605482	I said it's fun, but it just, you know, like most WarioWares, I don't see the magic lasting.
3605842	3607742	Well, like most WarioWares.
3607822	3608662	There you go, Rob.
3609362	3610343	It's the same thing.
3610383	3621005	We all, I think everybody, everybody in your chatroom, everybody who listens to your show, and even including myself, I knew that this game was going to have a lot of shit, but it was going to be three hours long of gameplay.
3622466	3623486	But it's a great party game.
3624835	3626875	It is, and I don't disagree with you there.
3627176	3628276	So what do you want to defend?
3628336	3630956	Where am I wrong in my assessment of WarioWare?
3633177	3634157	Just because you're stupid, no.
3634617	3637978	I have to agree with that, too.
3639318	3639978	Yeah, I knew it.
3640038	3641299	I knew there was two people on the line.
3641539	3642359	Ranma, you're there, too?
3643799	3645640	All right, wait, wait, wait.
3645940	3652321	Okay, never mind the fact there's two people on the line right now, whatever, but what's this whole defending WarioWare thing?
3653913	3655133	I can't tell you why.
3656734	3657214	Okay.
3658194	3659875	Ranma, you care to chime in on this whole thing?
3661075	3664796	No, because I haven't played WarioWare yet, but I can say this because of you guys.
3664836	3668637	I did buy two new games, Luminous Mobile and Cooking Mama.
3669837	3671918	Did you hear that, Ranma, about Cooking Mama because of us?
3672198	3672918	He told me last night.
3673198	3673738	Oh, my gosh.
3673958	3677939	Luminous Mobile, you know, it's the only mobile game I think I've ever talked good about on this program.
3678500	3679460	So it's worth it.
3679520	3679940	It's a good buy.
3681155	3686137	I'm paying like $1.99 for it a month, and I'm connected to their servers, like top rankings and stuff like that.
3686157	3687418	I'm like, eh, no big deal.
3689239	3699524	But another thing about WarioWare, going back to that, is this shows almost everything that the Wii can do, even more so than Wii Sports did.
3701265	3704546	Well, but I could rent it and get a lot of that.
3705287	3705467	You could.
3705527	3705907	You could.
3707071	3713355	I think it's worth a buy if you have, like me, I always have people over here.
3713935	3718818	I don't know if you get that from OLR, but this place has become party central and it's starting to look like it too.
3719698	3720879	There's people here all the time.
3720959	3724801	Thusly, WarioWare, Mario Party, those games are excellent buys for me.
3725101	3730404	And for anybody with a large family or something, I just think for single player people, it's going to wear thin.
3731084	3734186	Yeah, and it's a whole other show to tell you what I've seen strewn about Rob's place.
3734753	3735994	Alright, yeah.
3736094	3740758	But one thing I do want to agree with you on, I do think the $50 price tag for that game is quite steep.
3740838	3752728	I think maybe if it was released at $29.99, maybe $39.99, that's kind of pushing the envelope, but I don't think $49.99 was a good idea, and I have to... I don't agree with Nintendo on that decision.
3753008	3755990	Alright, well, that's what it is.
3756270	3761735	So now I'm going to do something I've always wanted to do on this program, and I'm going to hang up on two people at once.
3763256	3764017	You suck!
3764117	3764257	No!
3766266	3766806	That was fun.
3772609	3776211	And that would be Pwned with a capital P, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio.
3776291	3776811	One more call.
3777431	3778612	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3778652	3779052	Who's this?
3780573	3781533	It's Legend of Zaku.
3781633	3782794	Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.
3782814	3783494	What's on your mind, my friend?
3783514	3784735	Showing me complete without a call from you.
3784895	3785855	I know, goddamn.
3786095	3787556	We were just wondering when you'd get through.
3787996	3789037	It's the first one of the year, though.
3790618	3791458	Well, what's up, Zaku?
3792849	3804114	You know, about the whole Wii debacle about the DJs going too far, not sure, you know, basically f***ing up when they shouldn't, when they should, you know, take diligence.
3804234	3805554	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3805594	3812457	What's the point with, I mean, I'm not trying to belittle your call and your opinion is certainly important, but goddamn if I haven't talked about this issue until I've been blue in the face.
3812757	3814278	Remember, Zaku, I live here.
3814598	3819860	If you think it's water cooler talk where you are, it's like ten times as much where I am, because, like, everybody thinks they knew her.
3820572	3824835	Right there, it's a local, one of the local things that's happening around the back of the woods.
3825396	3843030	And so, I mean, I could say that they're able to face involuntary manslaughter charges just for the fact that if you heard the tapes and all the recordings that were actually saved, you could see on their part that they're just shrugging off people that could have warned them.
3843590	3845672	And they just, they show no regard.
3846252	3847793	They said that they had, like, um,
3849952	3853013	They had them sign a waiver.
3854273	3856934	I go back to what someone in chat said earlier.
3856974	3858454	It's not just the DJs.
3858474	3861275	There were 10 people that went into making this contest.
3861595	3864496	The DJs just egged it on, but that's their job.
3865216	3870518	Yeah, the people, basically, not only the DJs, but the people involved in organizing the event.
3870558	3872298	They'll face justice eventually.
3876018	3879379	and I think in a civil trial, the entire station is going to pay for it.
3880079	3886581	I wouldn't doubt, I've got to be honest, Zachu, I wouldn't doubt if that station doesn't go through some radical changes.
3886701	3891503	I bet you anything, and I'll keep you posted, but I'll bet you that whole station goes down over this.
3892603	3894804	They change their name or their look or something.
3894824	3896744	They're going to have to distance themselves from this somewhere.
3897084	3902226	I mean, when it's showing up on the BBC's website that your little local radio station...
3902981	3903081	Right.
3903101	3903221	Right.
3903241	3903521	In New York.
3903541	3903921	They call it Z100.
3903941	3904482	Yeah, Z100, essentially.
3926840	3934387	Yes, basically, I mean, when you have that, I mean, remember what happened with Opie and Anthony when they pulled that stunt a few years ago?
3934427	3938291	They got him kicked off a terrestrial radio for the first time?
3938551	3941213	Yeah, but having sex in a church isn't going to kill someone.
3942094	3944036	It actually went through a lot of format shifts.
3944536	3946138	It changed formats throughout the years.
3946838	3952804	From the time of the incident until now, it just went through, what, a second format change?
3953519	3962884	So yeah, I mean, they tried their best to distance themselves, and what I see in the future, I hope not, but I mean... Make it quick, Zaku, they want this topic banned in chat.
3962944	3963465	Final thought.
3966066	3969228	Just reformat the station, and that's about it.
3969308	3973870	I mean, they will face justice eventually, so, you know, one of these people will end up paying.
3974531	3977132	Well, we'll keep you here posted on Orange Lounge Radio.
3977192	3980554	Unless this continues to have nothing to do with gaming, then we probably won't say anything at all.
3981114	3981394	Alright.
3981555	3982355	Alright, have a good one, Zaku.
3982981	3983461	Alright, see you.
3983642	3984022	Later.
3985923	3992288	I don't know how you guys feel about this, but my personal thought is I'm willing to talk about this as long as it has to do with gaming.
3992629	3995051	If Nintendo is brought into the suit, then it has to do with gaming.
3995351	3997653	But if it stays the way it is, I don't really want to talk about it anymore.
3997773	3998273	We've said enough.
3998874	3999634	Nail in the coffin.
3999835	4000115	Thank you.
4001556	4002076	One more call.
4002617	4003998	Oh, damn, it just went away.
4004178	4005779	Maybe they'll call back.
4006280	4007981	Finish up that thought on the last minute story you had real quick.
4008161	4008401	Oh, yeah.
4008481	4011604	There's another one that's coming out for the Wii, another game.
4012062	4012943	That's being put out.
4013443	4023811	That's actually going to be kind of like a crazy taxi, but with emergency vehicles called Emergency Mayhem.
4024151	4026193	That's being put out by Codemasters.
4026433	4028674	Also going to be on the PS2 and the PSP.
4029435	4030196	That looks kind of fun.
4032297	4032617	That's it.
4032898	4033398	That's all I got.
4033618	4034799	All right, we got our caller again.
4034839	4035600	Let's go to the phone.
4035620	4036840	This will be the last one, I promise.
4037581	4038682	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4038702	4039042	Who's this?
4040523	4041464	Hey, Shadow Next Gen.
4041991	4043852	Hi, Shadow Next Gen, what's on your mind, my friend?
4045033	4045834	How's it going, guys?
4046554	4047895	Uh, pretty good, you know.
4048235	4048596	It goes.
4049776	4050017	It goes.
4050737	4055580	First of all, since I haven't been able to call in for a while, I want to say I really enjoyed your appearance on AGI.
4056361	4056821	Thank you.
4057442	4060784	We've actually been getting quite a few compliments on that.
4060804	4061505	That's something else.
4061645	4063546	You know, we like working with Scott and them.
4063586	4063906	It's fun.
4065207	4069490	Yeah, although tomorrow's show should be funny if Scott shows up since his Patriot's lost.
4070291	4070751	Ha ha ha.
4071127	4077271	You know, I don't really follow football, but I do know he was pretty passionate about the game tonight, so that should be interesting.
4077291	4078171	But aren't they off all week?
4080593	4082574	They have a show tomorrow, I believe, and then they're off.
4083835	4084235	Interesting.
4084635	4084855	All right.
4085156	4086997	Well, what's on your mind tonight in regards to gaming?
4089018	4094881	I was curious about, it was actually a comment, I think it was AGI, I made it a while back.
4095022	4097283	It was either AGI or you guys, because I listen to both of you a lot.
4098207	4109335	They were worried about with the Wii's price point, this was back in October or September, about how since Nintendo was supposed to have all of these different consoles, how you would be able to walk into a store and find anyone with no problem.
4110215	4118901	And therefore, they thought there would be a problem because people would see it as, you know, since it's already there, you know, it wasn't really that good or it wasn't that hot of an item type of thing.
4120442	4122023	I can't remember if we said that.
4122083	4126126	I don't think that we would have said that because my kind of viewpoint on it is that
4126904	4130465	I think, you know, a little bit of demand is a good thing, but this is too much.
4131225	4132146	This is too much.
4132166	4134146	This is exactly what Microsoft went through, you know?
4135327	4135747	Yeah, yeah.
4135767	4146230	Well, I was just kind of curious about what your thoughts were as how people were predicting now what happens, and now the exact opposite has happened where you cannot find a Wii anywhere, but you can almost walk into any store and find a PS3.
4148109	4154271	Yeah, you know, but I wonder how much, I don't have any sales stats, I don't know, but how much of this is Nintendo making?
4154311	4156191	I mean, how has production been at the Wii's?
4156552	4158072	Been pretty low.
4158412	4167795	Yeah, because what I understand is that we all have this impression that the Wii's are just rolling off the freaking assembly line, but I believe I heard somewhere else that the actual amount of shipments that these places are getting are not weekly.
4168635	4174417	No, they're not weekly, and I want to say the last shipment we got was in December, the next one we're getting is this week, and
4175234	4176234	That's how long it's been.
4176274	4178175	It's been a few weeks since we've gotten anything.
4178195	4179235	And it's because they're sold out.
4179255	4180175	They're sold out of that.
4180195	4181115	They're sold out of DS.
4181135	4184096	They're sold out of Zelda, the GameCube Zelda.
4185717	4187417	They're just way behind in everything.
4187437	4188517	They're too damn popular.
4189337	4192998	And the thing with the PS3 being in stock is not because they're shipping a ton of units.
4193078	4195999	It's because they're not selling as many units as they're shipping.
4196419	4199980	They're just getting shipments every now and then, but they're just not selling them.
4200874	4203936	It's not the hot item they thought it would be, or at least not yet.
4204356	4209559	Well, the system's not going to sell very well if there's only 13 games out for it, so that's a problem.
4210460	4213501	Out of curiosity, are you a Wii or PlayStation 3 owner yourself?
4215122	4215783	A Wii and a 360.
4216903	4218164	Ah, so you're a Wii 60 camp.
4218204	4219125	Any interest in PS3?
4219305	4221186	Excuse me?
4221566	4222647	Any interest in PS3?
4224548	4225428	Maybe down the line.
4226249	4230011	It will depend on how many more exclusives leave Sony.
4231547	4232408	He sounds just like me.
4233388	4240633	Because all I need to hear is basically like a Final Fantasy or a Kingdom Hearts on the 360 and I might be done with Sony.
4241474	4241954	Yeah, I know.
4242595	4249900	If Square came out tomorrow and announced Kingdom Hearts 3 for the 360, put a fork in Sony as far as I'm concerned.
4251461	4251941	But I don't know.
4251961	4255124	Again, I say that kind of jokingly on here, but I don't know.
4256064	4259707	Let's not forget that Katamari Damacy was a very excellent
4260271	4262172	I'll be at third-party exclusive.
4262332	4264193	Well, I mean, I guess all these games are third-party exclusives.
4264413	4265213	They went over to Sony.
4265273	4266354	It was just an awesome game.
4266954	4270096	And PS2 took a little while to build up some steam.
4270216	4272277	I didn't buy a PS2 on launch day.
4272597	4273577	I didn't buy one for a while.
4273597	4275258	I don't think I bought one until Final Fantasy X came out.
4276139	4279600	I didn't get one until the slim units came out is when I got my PS2.
4279800	4280201	Oh, you know what?
4280221	4281561	I had an import one for the longest time.
4281581	4282041	That's what it was.
4283682	4286364	Well, anyhow, anything else you want to share with tonight's program?
4287344	4287564	Oh, yeah.
4287584	4288885	I had another question for you guys.
4288925	4289345	I know it
4289810	4297532	Probably a little late, but I was wondering if there was any particular game or series in 2006 that you guys wanted to play but didn't get to?
4300673	4306435	Any particular series or game in 2006 that we wanted to play but didn't get to?
4306455	4308335	But didn't have the time to get to or whatnot?
4311516	4314877	Maybe something you're looking forward to, but you just didn't get to it for whatever reasons?
4315700	4319121	How about games I didn't spend enough time with that I wanted to spend more time with?
4319362	4320082	Trauma Center.
4322023	4323543	I actually did play a lot of Trauma Center.
4324544	4325684	The Final Fantasy games.
4325784	4330406	I played 12 enough to know that I put in a pretty good chunk of hours.
4330426	4331747	I went up to the double digits in hours.
4332507	4336929	I wish I could have spent more time with that and I needed to play Final Fantasy 3 enough.
4337429	4341971	I never did get Cooking Mama and Jamie won't shut up about it so I know I needed to check that one out.
4342691	4344732	I'm trying to think what other...
4345202	4350044	Have any of you guys tried out the Shadow Hearts RPG series?
4374480	4378881	I've heard of it, and I've heard really good things about it, and I have a friend who's playing it, but I haven't played it myself.
4379261	4380842	Is that something you think ought to be on my list?
4382062	4383383	Yeah, yeah, they're excellent games.
4383403	4384643	Yeah, they have three of them out now.
4384703	4386423	I don't know how well they sell.
4386463	4389764	I mean, they sell well enough to where the sequels have been coming out.
4390004	4394206	But, yeah, I think it's one of them that flies under a lot of people's radar for whatever reason.
4394606	4395786	Are those on GameCube?
4397066	4397547	PS2.
4397787	4398267	PS2?
4399007	4400147	I am thinking of something else.
4400167	4401008	I've heard of it.
4401168	4401948	I've heard of it, too.
4402008	4402628	I haven't really played it.
4403689	4404570	I still wanted to play Akami.
4404590	4405470	Send some info to my email.
4405490	4406010	I'll check it out.
4406030	4406791	I'll at least rent it if nothing else.
4425962	4429524	Okay, and then one quick thought and then I'll clear the line for you guys.
4429704	4430504	Yep.
4430844	4435346	Loki, have you heard about the Wii Play pre-orders being sold out with GameStop and EB?
4436086	4439228	Loki, have you heard about the Wii Play bundles being sold out with GameStop and EB?
4439728	4439948	Yep.
4441969	4442929	What do you think of that?
4443290	4443970	What do I think of that?
4444010	4445791	Do you know anybody else that's doing pre-orders for that?
4446611	4453054	Yeah, I know a lot of local mom and pop stores are doing pre-orders because I know we got our allocations and...
4454643	4459705	We got quite a bit of units allocated to us, so I'm surprised that they're sold out already.
4461726	4464207	I'm hearing Wii Play's not worth it unless you need the controller.
4466128	4466908	That's what it is.
4467008	4470470	Everyone's getting in front of the controller, and it's basically almost like a free game with it.
4470490	4471330	It's $50, right?
4472591	4472871	Isn't it $49.99?
4472931	4473271	I thought it was $39.99.
4473311	4473591	Is it $39?
4473651	4473911	No, it's $40.
4473991	4474191	I'm wrong.
4474211	4474191	$49.99.
4474231	4474351	Okay.
4483120	4484281	Thanks for taking my call, guys.
4484361	4485642	And like I said, big fan as always.
4486002	4486522	No problem.
4486542	4488243	We appreciate the call and the game recommendation.
4488363	4488984	Have a good one, buddy.
4489804	4490505	Yeah, talk to you later.
4490645	4490905	Later.
4492026	4492206	Yep.
4492626	4494547	You know, like I said, we have day jobs and all that stuff.
4494567	4496849	We can't always get around to playing everything, but we try.
4496989	4498630	Between the three of us, we play an awful lot.
4499070	4505014	You know, I like to play a lot of types of role-playing games, although somehow I missed that one.
4505174	4511338	Loki likes to play the shoot and kill the hooker type games, and Jamie likes to play really weird shit.
4513268	4514229	Do you play weird?
4514509	4516751	No, you like to play Kingdom Hearts.
4516771	4517231	Yes, I do.
4517331	4540989	I was going to say, there's a funny website I read about today, I forgot to mention, TheBigBoxProject.com It's about this guy who needed to, he sent back a console, an Xbox 360 console to the actual, you know, to Microsoft originally, and the problem is they sent it back and it's still busted, so they want to
4541610	4555059	Now, I guess between the time that he sent the first one and the second one needs to go back, they've changed their policy and they want him to pay Debit Fixed or whatever, so he's like, okay, fine, if that's the case, then I'm gonna send this in the biggest fucking box I can find.
4555499	4566666	So he's trying to pay for, to get one of those, like, um, rail car crates, like the big giant, you know, rail cars to deliver this thing in, and, um,
4567518	4572562	It's funny because on the website, if you go to it, it has this little dialogue on here.
4572682	4574943	It says, how big is your repair center?
4574983	4584410	And then their technician's like, I don't see how that pertains to the situation, sir, because I'm going to send you my broken Xbox in the biggest damn box you've ever seen.
4585271	4587212	Will it be filled with little styrofoam pellets?
4587232	4588153	That's what I want to know.
4589173	4589974	I can only hope.
4591195	4592296	I can only imagine it will.
4596158	4602280	That's like somebody pokes a little hole in the box and suddenly they're under a mountain of styrofoam pellets.
4605121	4608121	Or just, can you wrap the Xbox in that much bubble wrap?
4609082	4610822	It should be wrapped in duct tape.
4611202	4612343	Solid duct tape.
4612803	4621965	That would be a better use of your money right there is to take the box and wrap the whole box in like, I don't know, two feet of duct tape.
4622225	4623025	Two feet thick.
4623426	4624326	And that would be awesome.
4624366	4624786	Just send it.
4625680	4626080	DarkSakura.com
4650171	4650851	Yeah, I'm okay.
4651732	4652632	Just making sure.
4653193	4653633	Need a hug?
4654433	4655474	No, I need food.
4655634	4656114	Well, food.
4656174	4656634	Sounds good.
4656834	4657255	No coffee.
4657295	4658355	I have to sleep eventually.
4658375	4658876	Well, food.
4658996	4661037	To get to the food, we have to get to our final thoughts.
4661337	4662798	We've got to wrap this thing up.
4663158	4664919	Thank you guys so much for listening to us.
4664959	4665999	Let's go around and get the final thoughts.
4666079	4666339	Loki.
4668661	4671122	My final thought is I need to play more Resistance.
4672983	4679146	My final thought is I'm getting my PlayStation 2 back from my friend because I have this urge to play Kingdom Hearts ever since I got back from Disneyland.
4679738	4680639	Damn Disneyland.
4680899	4681239	Damn it.
4681880	4685322	Also, do you know I subscribed a video podcast this week to talk about Disneyland?
4686223	4687003	And, uh, yeah.
4687984	4688744	That's pretty sad.
4688965	4689905	I'm turning into Jamie.
4690426	4691426	Jamie, your final thought.
4693628	4695910	You need some gas, X?
4696270	4696410	No.
4698151	4699152	You don't have anything else to say?
4699832	4701894	You don't have a certain phrase you say every week on the show?
4702935	4703915	Kiss my ass!
4708178	4708879	You're not gonna say, uh,
4709980	4710480	to reject.
4710841	4711621	Kiss my ass.
4711821	4712222	All right.
4712302	4712522	Fine.
4712562	4713523	I'm just checking.
4713643	4715284	I want to make sure that's the official final thought.
4715904	4716225	All right.
4716865	4717305	Bend over.
4718426	4718686	All right.
