00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, January 28th, 2007, Wii gets a new channel and rumors circulate of another,

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
Sony gets confused about its own game, and a new PC release shatters sales records.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that video game podcast dedicated to video games, the gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
I'm here to help you through the next few hours. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Roar. How you doing? Roar.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Do you need to be fed? Should I throw you some meat?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
No, no, no. I just had an awesome, awesome night and a really crappy morning.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm glad to hear about your awesome night and I'm sad to hear about your crappy morning.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm sure we'll hear more about it a little later.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
The Silver Lancer of Love is in the hospital.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
So your car is broke. What happened to your car?

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
The bearings have some problems. It's not really the bearings themselves, just their grinding a little bit.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
It was in my car last night. You heard it. It was pretty bad.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
But we replaced my rotors, calipers, and the brakes.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
See, what we did there was a little radio trick because the listeners don't know that I was in your car last night,

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
but it's a way for me to get you to talk about the problem because they don't know what's wrong with your car.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
I know, but I was saying it for the sake of the noise that it was making.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
It was pretty bad. It was pretty bad.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
The death noise. You want to know what death metal is? Just let your brakes grind.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
I thought her tire was flat, actually, is what I thought it was.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
And then I got out of the car and I poked all the tires and they were fine. I said,

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
You're fucked.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Rob probed my car.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
I did.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
It was great.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
You're the one who had the probe.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Say hello as well to the always probing tech master, Loki.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Hello.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
You might want to turn that mic on so you can talk to us tonight.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Hello.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Hey, how you doing?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Good.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
217 weeks, we're still having difficulty turning on our microphone.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah, I don't check these things.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I turned it off, too. I was the one that did that.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
How was your week?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
You had a pretty good week?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah, it was okay.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
It was good.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
I apologize in advance. I've kind of lost my voice somewhat tonight.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
You're going to hear that my voice is kind of scratching.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm doing my best trying to drink some tea and coffee,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
but those folks that have emailed us or posted on web forums that,

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Rob talks too much on the show.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Rob should shut up once in a while.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
You're probably going to get your wish tonight because, as you can hear,

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm strained a little bit.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
We've got some emergency for you.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
I know. I'm probably going to drink some a little later, but my throat,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
you know, I need hot drinks for the throat, so I've been drinking some green tea.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Boil it.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I will make some coffee later.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Boil it. It will be lovely and nasty.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I might try it. We'll see. I can drink whatever.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, I've been performing with a Rocky Horror Picture Show cast in the Bay Area,

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
and I was emceeing the show last night, introducing everybody out in San Francisco

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
and just screaming at the top of my lungs.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
So that was kind of a stupid thing to do because now I have no voice.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
So my bad. What can you do?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
All right. Well, anyway, let's get into some game talk,

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
and we'll start it off with how is your gaming week,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
because we always start off the show with how is your gaming week.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
So Dark Soccer, how is your gaming week?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I played a little bit more Cooking Mama.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
I haven't really had time to play much of anything as far as actual games go,

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
although I'm really thinking I'm going to actually stick with Guild Wars

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
for my game of choice.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
I might play World of Warcraft, but right now I really don't have time with school.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
My education really is the focus.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
But last night I was over here while Rob was off in Rocky Land,

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
and I was watching a Miklotov play through Silent Hill 2, which was awesome,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
but it wasn't scary to me.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
There's only, like, one thing that really freaked me out,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
and I don't even remember what that was.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
I think it was climbing down the ladder and having Pyramid Head just be there,

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
and that spooked me a little bit.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
That was really it.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Oh, and I played some Pinball.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
I downloaded a game from my phone, though.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
I downloaded Pac-Man Pinball, and it's ass.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
What's wrong with it?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
It's just boring.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
It's not very...

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It's two fields, and that's it.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Is it just a normal Pinball game, like hit left and right?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Stupid.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Sounds boring.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Like, they should do, like, virtual Pinball for the phone so I can play Black Knight.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Are there cell phone games you enjoy?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Because there's only, like, one or two I enjoy.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
I have two that I play, and that's Luminous and Bejeweled.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
The only two I play are Luminous and Super Pac-Man.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
You know, Super Pac-Man's really hard to play on my phone.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I would much rather play it, excuse me, on an arcade machine or something,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
but, you know, it's not bad for on the go.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I did delete virtual Pinball off of my computer

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
because it turned out that I had no space left,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
and I managed to free up 17 gig.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Jesus.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Oh, yeah.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
17 gigs.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
On a 250 gigabyte hard drive.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
It's all that, all the TV I'm downloading.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Thanks to certain people who are trying to get me into watching Heroes.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
It worked.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Bite my ass.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I'm going to also introduce our invisible fourth guest

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
who's always here with us every week.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
That's the chat room, because Orange Lounge Radio,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
we believe in letting you guys be a part of our program.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
So if you're listening live to us here on this Sunday evening,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
Click on chat, or I believe you can also just go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I think our lovely webmaster, VXJ's next V,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
set that up quite some time ago,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
and I keep forgetting to announce it that way.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I want to say hi to the noobs.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
I know Godlike93 introduced himself as a chat room noob tonight,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
so hi, noob!

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I think I recognize all the other names.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
If I missed any other noobs in chat tonight, I apologize.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
The chat room is pretty much being very foul

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
as to why I have no voice tonight.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
NM64 said Sky ate too many dicks.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Screw you.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Screw you.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I just screamed a lot.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I said the F word repeatedly very loudly,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
and that's why I have no voice today.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
Of course, that doesn't really help that story, does it?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
No, it does not.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Never mind.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I think I want to edit that out of the show,

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
but we don't do that.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
All right, Lowkey.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
How was your gaming week?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
My gaming week was fun.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
We played...

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I actually finished Resistance finally,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
and the end's kind of okay.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
They're definitely making another one.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Didn't get a chance to play multiplayer, though.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I should have done that,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
but I was too busy playing Crackdown, the demo,

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
and I played that about six or seven times

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
all the way through,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
so that's over three hours of Crackdown,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
and it's a fun game.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
It's exactly what I was hoping it would be.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
I mean, it's a perfect game for me

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
because you're this overpowered,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
almost like a superhero-type character

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
just abusing the crap out of the citizens

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
that live in this one city.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
And then I did get to play last night

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
multiplayer with Jeremy Todd 100,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
and that was fun.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
We just kept busting up

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
just how retarded things got.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
I kind of couldn't get into the Crackdown demo,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
but I played it when I didn't have a lot of time

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
to spend with it,

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
but you and I need to set a time

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
so you can show me what the hell

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
I'm supposed to do in that game

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
because it looks like it's pretty.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
It looks like it might be fun.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
When you actually sit down

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
and look at some of the detailing,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I mean, there's a lot of cars and people,

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
which is a lot more than, say,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Saints Row or something like that.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
I do like just the amount of detail in it

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
and just the fact that when you're not

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
going around and trying to kill people,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
you can climb a lot of stuff in there,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
and that's actually kind of fun also.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
It's kind of a different aspect of the game.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
They reward you for that too.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
In fact, one of the achievements

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
is climbing the tower that you start off in,

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
and that thing is high.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
I managed to get up about,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I don't know, 20, 30, 40 stories,

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
and they jumped off of it and landed on a cop.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
To my enjoyment,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
we both exploded once I hit the ground.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
But it was, I don't know,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
it's really, really fun,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
just a lot of killing things.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I'm worried that it might be a little short.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
I'm not sure just because it seemed like

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
you could run through it pretty quick,

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
and if I've already killed three of the

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
kind of gang leaders in this already in 30 minutes.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Wasn't there some footnote in the demo

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
that said it was moving at an accelerated pace?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Well, the leveling up.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
The skills were moving a bit faster,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
but if you spend time with it leveling up,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
you just kick the crap out of everybody later on,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
which is fine because it's fun.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
But co-op is definitely where it's at.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I really wish it was more than two players,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
but even what was kind of weird,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
though, when you're playing co-op,

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
there was lag, but there was lag on my end.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
I would move and it would be delayed on my screen,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
which is kind of weird, but it was fun.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
I liked it, so I can't wait to check out the full game.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Alright, is that it?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I think that's it, yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
My game movie wasn't that exciting either.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Not a whole lot of new stuff to play.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I did play Luminous because the Heavenly Stars skin

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
came out this week, and of course,

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
that's one of my all-time favorite songs in Luminous,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
probably like Shining and then Heavenly Stars.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
So I was very excited to hear that it was coming

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
to the Xbox Live Arcade, and it's really cool.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
It looks great on the TV, and it's a good time.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
The only thing is that I think the mode that they made for it,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
like they have a Heavenly Star mode,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
where basically you just play the same song

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
over and over and over again, is kind of pointless.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I think it kind of proves that putting Heavenly Stars

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
in the game was a bit of an afterthought.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I think it's kind of weird that Heavenly Stars

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
is the only song available right now, too.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Don't you remember at E3 there was supposed to be Madonna,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
and they were talking about they were getting together

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Warner Brothers Records to get all these songs.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Where did those show up?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Because I think it would have been better

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
if they released a few of those for, I don't know,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
400 points or whatever, released several of those,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
and had a mode for that, like music video mode.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Because the only place that Heavenly Stars really works

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
for me is using it in skin edit mode.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
And when I'm playing it in skin edit mode,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
I don't really play the whole song,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
because you move on to the next skin after four levels,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
and I'm actually getting better at Luminous,

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
so I can usually get through four levels

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
at about half the song.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
But I can't complain, it's free.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
And I applaud Microsoft and Q Entertainment

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
for trying to correct some of the microtransaction mistakes

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
they made by making this content so cheap right now,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
and applauding the early adopters and everything.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
So it's really hard to complain.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I just think it could have been approached a little better.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
That's all.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
And I'm really looking forward

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
to seeing some additional content.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I would not want to see them do the Madonna song,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
where you just play the Madonna mode over and over and over,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
because it's all tracked separately and play history.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
And it has separate ranking boards.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
It's just a little much.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
It's almost like there's too much.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Does that make sense?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Let's see.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
The other game I played was World of Warcraft.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Honestly, I've been getting sucked back into World of Warcraft.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I'm a little torn druid now,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
which I know some people are probably like,

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
I can do that in no time flat.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Well, you know what?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
I have a job.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I have other stuff to do.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
But I'm having a lot of fun with it,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
and we've got a guild growing.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
We have some OLR listeners in it.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
We're over on the Ravencrest server.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
If you want to join us,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
check out the forums for more details.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
We're not called OL Army, though.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
It's a Silent Hill-based name, actually,

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
for whatever reason.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
That's just Shane's running the guild,

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
and that's what he picked.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Miklotov.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
You know him as Miklotov on the show.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
That's what he picked.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
And it's a good name for a Horde guild.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
So, Horde side, Ravencrest.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Visit the Orange Honors Radio forums

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
for more detail at orangehonorsradio.com.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
And that's it.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
That's pretty much all my gaming week.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Not anything else major.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Just some other little bits here and there.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
I think I might have played a game of Heavy Weapon.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
That's about it.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Oh, yeah.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I played Heavy Weapon.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
You didn't like it?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
No, I thought it was stupid.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
I thought it was way better

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
than most of the stuff they've been releasing lately.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Oh, that was dumb.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Really?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I'm glad I didn't buy it.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
You know what I didn't get

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
that I'm actually surprised I didn't buy

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
is Zelda on Virtual Console,

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
because it's one of the games

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
I've really been waiting for,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
but this is seriously what MMOs do to me,

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
is that I kind of don't care,

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
because I'm like,

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
oh, I got to level my druid,

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
or else I'm not going to be able

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
to stay on top with everybody else.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
I need to get out of that mindset.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
It's not healthy.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I just haven't bought it

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
because I already have them.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Yeah.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
We did play R-Type.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Oh, yeah.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
That's right.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
You were over here playing R-Type.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
I watched you play that last night.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
How was that?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
God, I suck at it.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
I can't play it without the TurboGrafx controller.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Isn't it sad?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I don't know how many older gamers we have

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
that listen to this program.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
I'd really like to hear from you guys,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
but folks who were in grade school,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
junior high, high school, whatever,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
when 8-bit Nintendo was out,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
and I remember being 10, 11, 12 years old

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
and breezing through some of these games

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
like Gradius and stuff,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
and I tried to play Gradius the other night.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
That is one of the games I played.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
I played Gradius on Wii, and I sucked.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I couldn't get past the volcanoes in the first level

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
because I swore I was going to do it without cheating.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I can't go back and play Nintendo Gradius, though.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
I have to play one of the later releases of it.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Does my hand-eye coordination get that bad with age?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
You're just old, Rob.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
I guess so.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Comments from Chat Room.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Jeremy Todd 1 says,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Everyone has to buy A Link to the Past.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I don't care who you are or what you do.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Buy it anyway.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
This game is the best game ever.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
I agree.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
It's probably one of the top five games of all time.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Hitstun says,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Heavy Weapon is nice by PopCap standards,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
but that doesn't make it a good game.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
I disagree.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
XBSkit adds onto that,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
saying the PopCap standard is the bottom of the barrel

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
next to Flash games.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
I don't know.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
There's some pretty crappy stuff on Xbox Live

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
outside the PopCap stuff.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
At least there's some playability there.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
I don't know.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
I disagree.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
I don't think PopCap's the best thing ever, OMG,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
but I think some of the stuff they put out

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
is pretty decent.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Bob Coffee says,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Don't give in to World of Warcraft.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Too late.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Alpha Canagram says,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Skye, I love Heavenly Star.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
I'm just annoyed that I can't turn off the sound effects

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
because sometimes I want to hear the actual song while playing.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah, you know how in Luminous,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
you know with the songs in the background,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
the little rotating the shapes will make a noise,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
and clearing a block off the screen will make a noise?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Some of that does get in the way of the song,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
but I don't find it.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
I liked for Shining, though.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Wow.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah, and Shining, it was incredible.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I don't mind it in Heavenly Star,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
and I think in Hollaback Girl it's funny,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
if you have the PSP one.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
By the way, I saw Luminous Plus on PS2 for sale the other day,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
and I remember what you were telling me

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
about how it went down in price, right?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Luminous Plus on PS2?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah, it's $19.99.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
It shouldn't be out, though.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
It's not coming out until way later.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
No, they had it on shelves at a place I went to at a GameStop,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
which you're usually pretty good about.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Yeah, Luminous Plus doesn't come out until the end of next month.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
For real?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
I should have bought it.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
I swear, they had like 40 copies

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
sitting right there on the shelf behind the little thing.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Luminous Plus.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Huh.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Maybe something happened.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah, they shouldn't have that yet.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
That's weird.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I'm going to check the web and see if it...

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Maybe if they changed the price, they bumped up the release date.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I don't really want to get it on PS2, though.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
That's too many versions.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
I have Xbox Live.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
That's good enough.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Then again, it would depend on the songs.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Do they have some good licensed song in Luminous Plus,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
or is it just a port of the PSP version?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
I think it's just a port of the PSP version.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Then forget it.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Forget it.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
I don't care, then.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
All right, let's go on and get into some other stuff for tonight's show.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
We want to talk about some housekeeping tonight.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Not a whole lot going on with our show itself.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
We want to talk about some of the other shows on our station.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Travis Donovan Live will not be live this upcoming Saturday,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
so I don't know if there's going to be a rerun going on

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
or what exactly is going to be happening with that.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Also interesting to note, I guess on his last program,

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
Travis announced his candidacy for president in 2008.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
So if you want to vote for an alternative,

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
I suppose you could always vote for Travis.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
So if you want more details, listen to his show.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
Saturday nights at 7 o'clock, but not this upcoming week.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
DMN is going to call us later in the show

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
because they scored a huge interview for this week.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
I'm pretty jealous.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
And Jamie, you are going to be pissed when you find out who it is.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
That's all I have to say.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
You're going to be pissed that they're not on this show.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Okay.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
You're going to want to reach through the screen and punch DMN.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Okay.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
That's pretty good.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
He'll call in later in the program.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Okay.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
So keep an eye on that at www.orangelandtrader.com.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Okay.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Okay, I'm going to shove this mic up your ass now, okay?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Hey, Rob.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
What?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Rob.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
What?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Hi.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
You expected me to say Rob a bunch of times, didn't you?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
I know.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Well, you know what?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Let's let the joke die.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Step away from the joke.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
No.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
All right.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
On a serious note, Dark Sakura wanted to start off tonight's program a little bit,

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
and we promised we wouldn't bring this story up again,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
but Dark Sakura had something she wanted to say,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
she wanted to talk about last week and us talking about it,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
and I'll just turn it over to her.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
So, Dark Sakura, what do you want to say?

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah, about the whole two-gallon water drowning lady.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Jennifer Strange, yes?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Yeah, sorry.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Hold your Wii for a week, KD&D.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I could only remember her last name for some reason.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Okay.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Well, it was pretty strange.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I got all of three emails about it.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
One of them was just stupid, and I immediately disregarded it

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
because if you want to make a valid point,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
don't start off by calling people names and being an idiot

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
then I don't respect you and I will never pay attention to anything you say.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Was it like a fuck you, you fucking fuck type of email?

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah, I'm like, you're an idiot, next.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
I did, however, receive one that really, I want to say,

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
was a well-thought-out letter, and I appreciate it,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
and just because, and I'm going to go ahead and say this,

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
I am, God, chat room, knock it off, shit.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Oh, God.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Anyway, Rob, you should just kick everybody.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I do, I do.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Do your statement.

17:25.000 --> 17:31.000
Anyway, what I was going to say before the chat room started acting like they had Tourette's

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
is that, you know, I couldn't go on when I was wrong.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
I even went back and said, yeah, I don't think it was necessarily a matter of deserving it,

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
but I come from the point of view of accountability for what you do,

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
of people having a free will.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
I apologize to anyone who might have been offended,

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
but my point of view still stands.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
It's a matter of, you know, looking at how much warning was given.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
There's still a lot of ambiguity regarding it,

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
so until I have proof that she was held down to the floor

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
and they forced water down her throat, I'm not going to feel as sorry for her.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I feel sorry for the kids.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
I feel sorry for the family, but she did choose to do it,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
so that's the point I'm standing on, and end of story,

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
but I do offer a public apology to anyone who might have been offended by my anger

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
because, honestly, if something like that happened to me,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I would not want to be made a victim.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
I would want my accountability to go on record

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
because, you know, if I had to go ride a roller coaster

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
and I know the roller coaster could fall over by, you know, tornado,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
and the tornado strikes and the roller coaster falls over,

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
I know when I die my horrible flaming death

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
that it was my choice to get on the roller coaster in the first place.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
But what a way to go.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I know. Wouldn't that be awesome?

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
But a friend of mine equated it, though, with, you know,

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
if you're a woman going out at midnight to 7-11,

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
there's a chance that you can get pounced in the alleyway and raped.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Well, that's the difference.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
She wasn't forced down onto the ground and forced water down her throat.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
She actually chose to do it after there was warning calling in,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
after they were saying, Do you feel sick?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Do you need to stop people talking about it?

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
So that's my point of view on it.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
My blame...

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
See, people keep using blame.

19:15.000 --> 19:21.000
Blame is stupid. I hate that word.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I don't blame her.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
I just think that she had a choice, and that's what I'm saying.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I just don't think that people should discount the fact

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
that she did have free will involved.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
And that's what people are doing.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Hopefully we can all get past this story

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
because I know, you know, I'm kind of sick of hearing about it,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
especially living here, because keep in mind,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
this was in our backyard, and we are hearing about this nonstop.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
It's in our paper every day, some type of new development.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
And top of that, I talked it over with several of my co-workers,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
lots of my friends, and everyone's saying,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Did we learn about this in middle school?

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
You know, if you saturate your body with water without replacing sodium,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
your brain's not going to function.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
That you learn in middle school.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
And for me, my whole thing is just that I don't...

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah, the radio station fully, they are fully responsible.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Well, not say fully responsible,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
but they should be the ones punished for the event, not her.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
I think that, you know, what happened to her is a horrible tragedy.

20:20.000 --> 20:27.000
But I think that people should just not say she had no part in the blame.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I hate the word blame.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
I just think that people should understand she did choose to participate.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
I don't think this should have happened to her.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
I don't think any of that should have happened.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
But just let her be accountable.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
Let her be posthumously accountable and not the big bad victim,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
because we're a country of victims and it's sickening.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
All right.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
Well, I'm going to try and keep the show moving,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
but I do want to say this, just kind of a friendly reminder that,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
you know, Orange Andrea, part of the reason why we're here

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
is to let gamers all have their voice,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
whether you may agree with it or not.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
And sometimes it's on a very superficial level

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
where it's Nintendo versus Sony versus Microsoft.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
And, you know, sometimes we call Sony executives' names

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
and you may not agree with that.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
And sometimes we may be praising Nintendo or Microsoft things

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
that you don't agree with or whatever it may be.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
In this case it was something that wasn't so superficial,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
something that really struck a nerve.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
But keep in mind that part of the reason why the three of us are here

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
and part of what Jamie brings to the show and Loki brings to the show

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
and I bring to the show is that we have pretty blunt opinions

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
and controversial opinions sometimes.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
And you may not always agree with it,

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
but we do have the right to have that voice, nevertheless.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
You know, I don't agree with Jamie 100% on this particular thing,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
but she has the right to say it and I defend her right to say it.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
So I also want to kind of get that out because, you know,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
if you're going to email me saying Jamie should be off the show,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
that's not going to do any good.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Did someone do that?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
You were CC'd on it.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Oh, was it that?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah, no, no, we'll talk later.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
But it was, you know, it's kind of one of those things.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Yeah, I'm going to be off of the show that I helped make.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
That's not going to happen.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
That's stupid.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
She, you know, even if I disagree with her,

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
I think part of the lure of the show is that I can hear her thoughts,

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
you know, and Jamie.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Dude, Firebomb had pointed it out.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
He said, but she's a woman and she therefore has no opinion.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Why is it?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
And the only complaints I got were from men.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
Well, to be fair, we probably have just more men than women

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
that listen to this show and that's just the culture we're in.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
But I noticed, though, in general that any time I could say something

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
and Matt could say the exact same thing,

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
but I'm the one that gets the emails about it that I should go, you know, be quiet.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
You know what?

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Hello, universe.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
I'm a woman.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
I have an opinion and you're going to fucking shut up and listen to it.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
So fuck you.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
That's how I feel.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
But at the same time, you have the right to express your rebuttal arguments

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
with your intelligent emails and, you know,

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
phone calls we do later in this program.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
Jamie's not totally shut off to hearing what else you guys might have to say.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
No, seriously.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
You present your rebuttal to me in an intelligent way.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
I'm more than happy to discuss it with you.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
I think we can agree to disagree, but I would love to hear.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
I invite anybody.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
If you've got an opposite opinion to what I have, I love debate.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Oh, my God.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
So prove it.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Bring it.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
All right.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I will discuss with you until the cows come home.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
Let's see what we can debate about this week by moving into some gaming news

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
and we're going to start it off tonight with Loki's got some more exclusives for us.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
You just keep getting the good shit, don't you, Loki?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
I keep trying.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
Oh, for the record also, Luminous Plus is listed on GameStop's site

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
as coming out on the 27th of February.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Something's up.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
God, I should go back and grab it.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Where did I see it?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Oh, I know where it was now.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Maybe I'll go grab it.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Anyways, so, yeah, we had a bunch of stories

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
and not just, you know, release dates and stuff.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
For example, we had a follow-up to, you know, a game we talked about.

23:49.000 --> 23:55.000
We announced originally on episode 206, High School Musical the Game,

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
which, you know, to me, I mean, I wasn't too interested about this.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
It is coming out for the Wii and PlayStation 2.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
It's based on the Disney Channel like musical that they apparently selling very well on DVD and stuff.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
But what's actually kind of made it more interesting for me

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
and as we put on the website earlier this week,

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
High School Musical the Game is actually going to be featuring a microphone peripheral for the Wii.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Which is kind of neat.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
So apparently you're going to be singing karaoke.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
I'm not sure if it's going to be an actual, you know, its own unit,

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
like its own controller,

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
or if it's going to be something that plugs into the bottom of the Wii mote.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
But either way, you're going to be singing karaoke with this thing.

24:35.000 --> 24:42.000
It is going to be coming out now in August, $69.99 for the bundle.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
And that's kind of interesting to see, you know,

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
some actual companies making some attachments for the Wii

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
other than say, you know, some stupid steering wheel like the Ubisoft games.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
But that's kind of neat.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
Other stuff we announced this week,

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
including there's going to be a brand new PSP game coming out

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
based on the Girls Gone Wild franchise.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
And it's actually a pool themed game.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
Originally it was going to be called Pocket Pool by itself.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
And then they picked up the Girls Gone Wild license.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Now, Eidos is producing it,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
and basically it's going to be your standard billiards game,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
but you unlock nudie pictures.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
So, you know, who doesn't like some good nudie pictures?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Which is hilarious.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I think that's a great name for the game, by the way.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
That's hilarious.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
And then finally, we've got some, well actually some other stuff.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Ubisoft, they announced Brothers in Arms War Stories for the DS.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Now, I've been reading some other sites out there saying that,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
you know, they've heard the same thing,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
but they're getting their info from the ESRB website

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
because it was listed on there.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
But either way, it is coming for the DS.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
It's going to be coming out on June 13th for $29.99.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
And it should be some interesting stuff.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
Also, there is a little bit of elaboration for Driver 76,

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
as I mentioned a few episodes back.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
It's going to be kind of based on the Driver Parallel Lines series,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
but it's going to be set two years previous

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
and it's going to feature all new missions and stuff like that.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
So that's going to be kind of cool.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
And then, of course, Sega's Virtua Fighter V,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
and this is also, you know,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
the street date's been listed on other sites,

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
but according to Sega themselves,

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
they signed a six-month exclusive contract with Sony

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
for the PlayStation exclusivity of it.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Where did you hear this?

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
Because I haven't heard this anywhere else about this six-month deal.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I heard this actually from Sega

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
because they came into our Dallas office

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
to do kind of their lineup of stuff,

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
and I was questioning them about dates and stuff.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
At least I was emailing our buyer about dates,

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
and she said that they're on a six-month exclusive deal.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
So I know GameStop had a tentative date on their website as,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
what was it, August something.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
It was towards the end of August,

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
but it would be six months from when it's actually released

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
in February for the PlayStation 3.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
So that's kind of interesting.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
And that was the exclusive news we had.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
And then, of course, my favorite one here,

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
the two Konami Wii titles that are going to be coming out in March.

27:18.000 --> 27:25.000
And now it's Wing Island and Kororinpa Marble Mania

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
is going to be coming out as well for the Wii.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Both are going to be pretty reasonably priced,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
only $39.99 for each.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
Both coming out on the 28th of March.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
So I'm sure we'll have more info about that next week

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
after Konami's Gamers' Day.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
But that was some interesting stuff.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Wait, was that Koro as in, like, C-H-O-R-O?

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
K-O-R-O.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
I want another Koro game.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
Anyways, there was some other stuff,

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
other announcements regarding dates as well.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
This one, Rob, you're going to like.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
Elevator Action for the Wii is coming out on June 13th.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
That's a pretty rad arcade game.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I'd be curious to see what they do with it.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
And, of course, Blade Storm's been delayed on the PlayStation 3

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
to June 15th as well.

28:15.000 --> 28:21.000
Call of Juarez for the Xbox 360 is coming out on June 15th.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
And Turok for the PlayStation 3 and 360

28:25.000 --> 28:30.000
also going to be coming out in September on the 12th.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
So lots of good stuff.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
And I'll, of course, be posting more dates

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
to our Under the Radar thread that we have on the forums.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
So keep an eye on that.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I will.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
All right.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Well, speaking of the Wii,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I guess we're getting elevator action pretty soon.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
And now we're getting rumors about new channels

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
that could be coming to the Wii.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
I mean, when the Wii went out and they first announced the Wii,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
we all knew we were going to be getting, you know,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
the news channel, the internet channel at some point.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Well, now there are rumors of a game channel,

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
and this was spurred by remarks that were made by John Lee,

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
who is the Hudson Entertainment Director of Marketing.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
He didn't say anything too specific about it,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
but when he was asked about downloadable games for the Wii,

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
this was his quote.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Quote, however, in the future,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
you should rephrase that question to,

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
are there any plans to launch original content

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
on some downloadable service on the Wii?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
And you might get a different answer.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Now Nintendo, of course, said, you know,

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
Wii cannot confirm what format the new content will be delivered.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
There will be original games at the Wii shop eventually.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
But it could be interesting,

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
because this is launching speculation

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
that it might be just a whole new channel

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
to separate classic Nintendo titles

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
and these, you know, downloadable titles

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
in a new channel by itself.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
Why couldn't he just not be a jackass about the whole thing?

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
You mean...

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
What do you mean?

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
I'm sorry.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
I can't answer your question

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
and ask me the correct question.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Riddle me this.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I think, you know, there are NDAs and things,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
so I think he's trying to think of a clever way around it.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I don't think he's a jackass.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
But that, I mean, they're just like, it's like,

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
you know, if you're asking, say, for example,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
imagine you're asking Sony

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
when the PlayStation 3 is going to be coming out in the UK

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
or something like that.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
You're like, so, uh,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
when are you guys going to be releasing the,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
you know, PlayStation 3 in the UK?

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
I'm sorry you did not ask the correct question.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I have a question in the form of a walrus.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Perhaps if you asked,

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
when is it coming to England?

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I might have answered you,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
but because you did not,

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
you will not be told the answer.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
I mean, that's just fucking annoying.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
It's just, you know, answer the damn question.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Fireboom asks an interesting question

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
out of left field here a little bit.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
It says, weren't we supposed to have different colors

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
for Wii consoles by now?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I want to say I read a story.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
It's not in our show world tonight,

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
but I want to say I read a story

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
somewhere on the internet earlier this week

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
that said, yeah, they were going to do different colors,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
but since they're having trouble keeping the gray ones

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
on shelves as it is,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
that the new colors are going to be quite some ways off.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
New colors will be something they do

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
when they want to sell more systems.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
They're not going to do it right now.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
They're not having trouble selling the systems yet,

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
so just wait until the systems start to die off a little bit,

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
start getting, you know, into the same situation

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
as the 360 and PS3 right now,

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
and then they'll throw out the extra colors

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
and do all these shit that you don't need for it.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
It's very interesting to see how the Wii is,

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
you know, I'm just thinking about this

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
because I read it today.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
One of my friends on LiveJournal,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
my old roommate, who wasn't much of a gamer,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
remember the very first OLR studio,

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
my roommate there?

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
Okay, he wasn't that super into games.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
He always kind of thought the show he did was kind of weird,

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
but he thought it was cool, right?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Well, he made this post in LiveJournal today

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
about how he wants a Wii

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
because he played one over the weekend.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
He thought it was awesome,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
and he says, I don't really get into video games,

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
but the Wii was fun.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
It was very interesting to read things like that.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
It's so interesting to read from the not,

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
you know, to take some time away from the game blog

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
because once in a while to read what other people have to say.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
It's just very interesting.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
I think Nintendo's very, very happy at reaction like that.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
That was their goal, was it not?

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
I suppose it was.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
Well, you know, we have actually a little bit more

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
coming from Nintendo, specifically about the channels.

32:01.000 --> 32:07.000
The news channel, there's a pretty good review of it, I found.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Have you...

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
I've played with the news channel.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
I played with that a little bit this week.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
It was fun.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Well, basically, the news channel,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
and this is a couple things that I like about it.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
It seems like it's got pretty easy browsing to it.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Brings up your local news based on your area.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
You can click on globe, though,

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
and it shows you where you are in relation to the rest of the world.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
It's pretty cool.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
You can also, there's a slide show.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
There's, you know, you can see the headlines come through

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
at the bottom half, and you pick wherever.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
You bring up any of the stories that come up on the slide show

32:41.000 --> 32:48.000
by pressing A. It's pretty easy to follow, I think.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
It's looking like they said that the relaunch of it

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
is going to be later this year,

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
and it's going to be free and offer more regions available for viewing.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
But so far, it seems so, you know, so far so good, pretty much.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
I actually like it quite a bit.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
I like it more than I like the forecast channel.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
But my only suggestion for the news channel would be that,

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
you know how the forecast channel has the temperature and things

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
in the Wii browser?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Like, you don't have to launch the forecast channel

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
just to see the temperature,

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
although it's horribly out of date, at least for this region.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
Like, it never updates after midnight or 6 a.m.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Like, it never updates for the rest of the day.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
But I kind of wish, like, you could,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
like, if I'm just quickly clicking through channels

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
to get to a virtual console game or something,

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
it would be cool to see, like,

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
what some of the top headlines are in the news channel at the moment.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Because that might make me go,

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
oh, I want to click there and read it.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Because if you think about it,

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
that's kind of how your email is set up, right?

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
If you use Yahoo mail or you use Hotmail

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
or one of those web clients for your email,

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
hell, even Gmail, you have links to news articles usually

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
or RSS feeds that run kind of along the side of your email.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
And sometimes that's what makes me stop and go,

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
oh, that sounds interesting.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
That's actually why I stopped using most of those

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
because my email is through my friend Julie's server

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
and I don't have to worry about any of that.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
But I don't mind it on, like, you know,

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
because I use Firefox ad block and stuff.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
But, yeah, when you use Yahoo mail,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
it shows you some of the top headlines, which is kind of cool.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
I stopped using Yahoo mail just because of that.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
I like to have my news where I can, you know,

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
if I'm going for news, I'm going specifically for news.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
That's why the first thing that I have pull up is my Yahoo page

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
and I have my world events and all that listing.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I would really, though, this is my hope.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
I'm not quite sure what their news source is,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
but I hope that they don't go with...

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Associated Press.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
They have a two-year agreement with Associated Press.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Okay.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
Well, I still, I'm very leery about most of our press publications

34:36.000 --> 34:43.000
just because there's a lot of bias, a lot of sensationalism in modern press.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Well, you know what I thought was hilarious is, you know,

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
of course one of the first places I went to look for stories locally

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
once I got to the Globe was Sacramento.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
And guess what the top news story was in the Sacramento region

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
on the news channel was about the, you know,

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
again, here's more news and to hold your Wii for a Wii thing

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
as if we could have more.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I was reading BBC news and saw crap on it.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Yeah, I know. It's everywhere.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
I usually go from my world news to a BBC world.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
So, of course that's on it,

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
but I thought it would be interesting that you're reading that on the Wii,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
you know, but what was even more interesting

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
is that when you looked in the technology and entertainment section,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
there was a story the first day it launched

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
about the PlayStation 3 launch being announced in Europe,

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
which I thought was very interesting.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
So, it was interesting that that was on the news channel.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Yeah.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
So, and you could even see a picture of a PlayStation 3

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
and it was just, it was kind of one of those moments.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
The very first time you see the Nintendo and Sega logos

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
on the screen together, like when you boot up F-Zero,

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
it was one of those moments,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
like looking at a picture of a PlayStation 3 on your Wii.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
It was weird.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
It was very awkward.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I like you with your Elibits icon on Xbox Live.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
That's true.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
My friends list icon on Xbox Live is an Elibit,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
so I guess that's not the first time.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
And, you know, at one time my background was a picture of Mario Kart

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
because that was when I was playing around

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
with using backgrounds from the computer.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
So, just fun to do little things like that, I suppose.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I like irony.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
Anyways, speaking about the Wii,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
there's going to be some fun stuff coming to the Virtual Console soon.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
And one of the biggest games coming, you know, to the Virtual Console

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
and only to, you know, Trump, you know, was it last week's,

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
you know, Link to the Past.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
Legend of Zelda the Ocarina of Time is going to be heading

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
to at least the Japanese Virtual Console in February.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
It's going to be slated for 1200 points

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
and of course it's going to make it to the United States

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
shortly after the Japanese one, if not the same day.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
But, that's awesome.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Not interested.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Okay, well that's awesome for other people.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
I'm not interested either because I had it on GameCube for the longest time.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Exactly. And the Wii can play GameCube games.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
So, what's the point?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Like, you know, I understand.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Sometimes people go like,

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
well Rob, then why do you bother downloading anything on there at all

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
when you can just use emulators?

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Okay, because I can't use emulators on my TV with a wireless remote.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
I'm just too lazy to set that thing up

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
and I like the authentic experience.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
But using that little GameCube disc with the Zelda game on it

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
is a pretty authentic experience.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Yeah.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
So, I don't get the point of downloading it.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I'm going to be downloading Mario Kart.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
But here's the best part though.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
You know, when this game does come out, you know,

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
it's going to be great and people are going to download it and stuff.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Then later on down the line, remember how, you know,

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
they were talking about, oh yeah, well we can do a line of games,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
you know, and thank the Game Boy Advance here, you know,

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
when they released the old Nintendo games for it again.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
We can do a line of games that are just GameCube and maybe Nintendo 64 games

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
ported over with the controls for the Wii.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
So, you would have like, you know, Mario Kart Double Dash or whatever

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
ported over like in being sold for say $29.99 or something like that

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
with just, you know, no changes whatsoever

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
other than the controls for the Wii.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
Watch this kind of happen or they release some sort of, you know,

37:54.000 --> 38:00.000
collector's edition of all the Zelda games or something again.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I'm reading what the chat room has to say on this.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Jeremy Todd 1 says, I have played and beat Ocarina of Time

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
a few too many times now.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I beat it on 64, I beat it on the GameCube,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
I beat it on the computer, whistles,

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
and like OLR said, I have the GameCube game so I can just play that.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
GS68 would like to point out, you know,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
playing the Ocarina is kind of hell with the C-Stick,

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
which does make sense because you didn't have the buttons on the GameCube,

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
you had that stick.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Well, it doesn't stop there.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
There's lots of titles coming to Japan, not just Ocarina of Time,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
but lots of cool stuff coming out in Japan.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
Now, keep in mind not all of these have American counterparts,

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
but some of them do and so you'll probably be seeing those before too long.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
Mighty Bomb Jack from the NES is coming out there soon.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
Galaga, again, these are Japan dates, coming out on the NES.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
Kirby's Adventure coming out on the NES.

38:44.000 --> 38:50.000
Kamaitachi no Yoru is coming out for the Super Nintendo.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
Megami Tensei, Super Goals and Ghosts,

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Sangokushi 4,

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
Bare Knuckles, Streets of Rage for Genesis,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Beyond Oasis, also on the Genesis,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Vector Man for the Genesis,

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Sword of Vermillion on the Genesis,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Vigilante on TurboGrafx-16,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Chu Man Fu,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Yokai Doshuki,

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
Wonder Momo also all coming out on TurboGrafx-16.

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
So, sounds like there's a lot of cool stuff coming out on your Japanese Virtual Console

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
and many of those titles that do have American versions

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
we'll probably be seeing those before too long.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Bare Knuckle, that brings back memories

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
because we picked up the Japanese cart

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
and used a converter on it to play on our Nomad

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
and it played it as Streets of Rage.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
It was a Bare Knuckle cart.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
That's weird, how did it know that?

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Sometimes they'll do that.

39:37.000 --> 39:43.000
Actually, a lot of the Neo Geo games will have a Switch.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
You can play them in either version.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
Our Japanese Samurai Spirits 2 is Samurai Shodown 2

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
and it'll play depending on what mode we have it in.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
You know what I'd like to see Nintendo do

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
and this is going to seem completely out of left field,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
but I would like to see them release some Japanese games

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
that never got released here.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
You know, and just...

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I mean, I guess...

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
Well, okay, that's a little obscure,

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
but I'm thinking Earthbound on the NES,

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Mother Zero or whatever it's...

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
The original Mother, which we call Earthbound Zero

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
on that translated ROM...

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
No, it wasn't a translated ROM,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
it was a ROM that somebody bought on eBay,

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
which is a prototype.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
So it's like that game is floating around there, half done.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
Wouldn't that be awesome if that came out on the Virtual Console?

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
I agree.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
I don't know.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Maybe that's just too much work,

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
but I can't believe that Nintendo isn't making an arm and a leg

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
off a lot of these Virtual Console games.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
We need the freakin' TurboGrafx Twinbee.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Oh, we'll see.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
And Parodius.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
We need Parodius.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
We'll see.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Anyway.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Well, something that will make a lot of people happy,

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
speaking of Virtual Console,

40:44.000 --> 40:50.000
is Mario Kart 64 is going to be on Virtual Console in Europe.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
It's actually the second Nintendo 64 title

40:53.000 --> 40:59.000
to be on the European Virtual Console.

40:59.000 --> 41:04.000
It's a really... It's Mario Kart.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
There's really not much else to be said about it,

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
but there's also a notice that Soldier Blade,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
which is a TurboGrafx-16 game,

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
is also going to be available for 600 points.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Well, everybody's getting in on the Mario Kart love now.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
It's nice to see another Nintendo 64 title get up there, though.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
And I'll tell you, Mario Kart on the 64

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
was the best version next to the original, I'd say.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
You know what we need is Pokemon Snail.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Toad's Highway.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
End of story.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Pokemon Snap.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
I would agree.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
Pokemon Snap would be pretty awesome.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
How about Superman 64?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Oh, fuck no.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
That was so funny.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
That'd be kind of cool, though.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Blast Corpse or something like that.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Or even, you know...

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Pokemon Puzzle League.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Actually, GoldenEye 64.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
You know what you'd probably like?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Dream On.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
It's a rare game.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
I know.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
Once they start doing the light gun games and stuff,

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
they should do...

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Super Scope.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Well, Super Scope would be awesome,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
but the Pokemon Snap or something like that.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
How awesome was the Super Scope?

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
It was a bazooka, for God's sake.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
It was awesome.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
I know.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
It was hard.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
I remember sitting playing,

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
because I had a Super Scope when they came out,

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
sitting there playing freaking Blastress

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
for long enough to wear out the battery in the Super Scope.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
That was six hours.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Oh, I have some folks agreeing with me in chat room.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
Alex says, Pokemon Puzzle League FTW.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
Rama says, I like Pokemon Puzzle League.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
I know what's up.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I want a Super Scope just to put on my desk.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
That would be cool.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
I have one.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
You'll probably get one at the auction.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
I have one.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Do you want it?

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Sure.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
I'll take a Super Scope.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
I'll see if we can find it.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
We actually have a Menacer somewhere, too.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Put it on my desk.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
The attachment that hooks onto the Master System gun.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
JVmon's leading a chant in the chat room for Yoshi Safari

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
with the Wii remote.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
That might be kind of fun.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
We need more Metal Slug.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
What are you talking about?

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
There's the fucking anthologies out on Wii.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
I know.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
I have it.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
But we need more Metal Slug, anyway.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
No, we don't.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Yes, we do.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I like how we did that in unison.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Great minds think like me.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
OK, no, WrestleMania 2000 should definitely

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
be on Virtual Console.

43:11.000 --> 43:18.000
Anyways, so speaking of the Wii, there's

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
one website that's actually creating sculptures of Miis,

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
which is kind of cool.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
AllisonQMcCarthy.com.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
Allison, anyway, she's creating some custom Wii sculptures

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
based on your Miis.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Right now, the demand's really big,

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
so she has an email list that you can sign up on.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
But the first few ones, she's actually

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
going to be doing some generic ones.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
She'll be posting them on eBay, see how they sell and stuff.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
But possibly later on, you're going

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
to be able to get, I guess, your own custom Miis, which

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
would be awesome, because I want to.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
They should totally have a service like that.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
I mean, think about it.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
They're doing the same thing for Spore,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
where you can create your own custom stuff.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
That made me think of the other thing,

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
like you can put your monsters for Spore.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Dude, I'm looking at this.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
I can do these.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Well, then do it.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
Make me one.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
I still have to do.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I have two more dolphins to face up on.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
You're a woman.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
You can make things, right?

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Hey, Rob, bite my ass.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
But anyways.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Are they like little bobbleheads?

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Sort of.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
They sort of look like a bobblehead.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
They look like they're made from stuff at Michael's.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
I think it looks cute.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
They are cute, but it's just a cool thing.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Make me one.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
Yeah, the stuff that's on these, you can buy the bits at Michael's.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Why don't you put up or shut up, Jamie?

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
No, seriously.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I'll do one once I have time between classes.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Awesome.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
I got free stuff.

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
So definitely keep an eye on AllisonQMcCarthy.com.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
Yeah, maybe square yourself your own Mii.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
How much do they charge you for the Miis?

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
Not saying yet because I think she's just starting off with this and got picked up by

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
everywhere, and now they're getting inundated with requests.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Poor thing.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
One of the downsides to getting digged.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
Was that on dig?

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
I'm pretty sure it was.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
I think it probably was.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
All right.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
Well, Nintendo's really digging the recent sales of the Wii.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
I mean, the Wii has just been selling like crazy.

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
3.2 million Wiis sold is what Nintendo announced earlier this week.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
That's pretty crazy.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
There's not a lot else.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
I mean, what else can you say about that?

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
They sold 3.2 million Wiis.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
That's a lot.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
And certainly interesting.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Now, I don't mean to sound anti-Sony.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
That's not what I'm trying to do here, but it is interesting when you see a thing like

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
this, and you're putting that next to a story where Sony's like, well, we shipped a million

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
in Japan.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
So, it kind of sucks for them.

45:45.000 --> 45:51.800
Well, just more, I think another, though, notch in Nintendo's belt, though, is that

45:51.800 --> 45:59.000
they actually did hit now 10 million consumers in America for the Nintendo DS.

45:59.000 --> 46:08.920
Since the November 2004 launch, that means that nine Nintendo DS or DS lights have sold

46:08.920 --> 46:12.200
every 60 seconds.

46:12.200 --> 46:13.200
Wow.

46:13.200 --> 46:15.720
Yeah, pretty crazy.

46:15.720 --> 46:20.120
I wonder if Sony's going to start pissing their pants.

46:20.120 --> 46:21.120
I don't know.

46:21.120 --> 46:23.640
No, they'll have some creative little press release for this.

46:23.640 --> 46:26.120
It'll be all the drugs that Kudaragi's taking.

46:26.120 --> 46:31.600
Black Boy in chat sums it up, says, God, Nintendo is making money hand over fist.

46:31.600 --> 46:36.520
Nintendo is selling in a month and a half with 360 sales in a quarter.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.520
Interesting.

46:37.520 --> 46:40.800
So, we have something, a comment on a story we did a little bit ago.

46:40.800 --> 46:45.360
Cutie Honey is in chat and says, the only Metal Slug America is missing is Metal Slug

46:45.360 --> 46:49.600
3D, which isn't terribly good, and I think that's to go along with your comment on we

46:49.600 --> 46:53.440
need more Metal Slug, and now I said, no, we don't.

46:53.440 --> 46:56.120
Metal Slug has to stay two-dimensional.

46:56.120 --> 46:59.760
That's just the awesomeness of it.

46:59.760 --> 47:01.480
I give Metal Slug a lot of crap.

47:01.480 --> 47:02.480
It is kind of fun.

47:02.480 --> 47:06.480
I just give Jamie crap for it because she never shuts up about it, but 3D, no, no, no.

47:06.480 --> 47:09.880
I haven't played it, but I'm not interested.

47:09.880 --> 47:14.560
If you want to play Metal Slug going the other direction, just play Shock Troopers.

47:14.560 --> 47:15.560
Okay.

47:15.560 --> 47:22.600
Anyways, off the topic of Metal Slug, but still an awesome game, Scarface is coming

47:22.600 --> 47:28.440
out for the Wii, and that's awesome because apparently, I was reading on some of the features

47:28.440 --> 47:32.200
of this, you're going to be able to wheel the chainsaw and use the Wiimote to chop off

47:32.200 --> 47:33.200
limbs.

47:33.200 --> 47:35.000
Thank God, this is what we needed.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.720
This is awesome.

47:36.720 --> 47:37.720
What are you talking about?

47:37.720 --> 47:38.720
No, I'm serious.

47:38.720 --> 47:41.280
This really is what we needed.

47:41.280 --> 47:43.080
Like, you know, come on.

47:43.080 --> 47:48.680
Ever since we heard the Wii is like GameCube with a Nitro Boost in it, it's like, where's

47:48.680 --> 47:51.400
my fucking Resident Evil 4 with my chainsaw?

47:51.400 --> 47:52.400
Come on.

47:52.400 --> 47:55.000
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.800
Words cannot describe how happy I am, and to be honest, I mean, I was kind of interested

47:59.800 --> 48:02.040
in the Godfather game coming out in March, but...

48:02.040 --> 48:05.480
Do you get to whack people with the Wiimote?

48:05.480 --> 48:09.000
You do get to manhandle people, though, with the Wiimote, so that's kind of...

48:09.000 --> 48:10.720
Can you say that again?

48:10.720 --> 48:12.520
Manhandle people with the Wiimote.

48:12.520 --> 48:13.520
Okay.

48:13.520 --> 48:15.520
God, you're so immature.

48:15.520 --> 48:18.120
No, but yeah, it should be pretty awesome.

48:18.120 --> 48:23.880
You know, of course, God knows when it's coming out, though, not anytime soon, I'd imagine,

48:23.880 --> 48:29.320
but I can't wait to hear more about this.

48:29.320 --> 48:30.960
That sounds pretty fun.

48:30.960 --> 48:37.120
Well, while we wait for Scarface to come out on the Wii, we could go to a completely different

48:37.120 --> 48:39.200
genre yet on another Nintendo system.

48:39.200 --> 48:41.320
Remember the Game Boy Advance?

48:41.320 --> 48:42.480
Remember it's still alive and kicking?

48:42.480 --> 48:43.480
I have one of those.

48:43.480 --> 48:44.480
I found mine.

48:44.480 --> 48:48.920
It's getting a breath of life in it with the Final Fantasy VI Advance release coming out.

48:48.920 --> 48:51.280
Now, of course, you've heard about this is getting a new localization.

48:51.280 --> 48:56.520
Well, what's interesting about the localization is that when they originally made the Final

48:56.520 --> 49:02.440
Fantasy III, they did some family-friendly kind of edits.

49:02.440 --> 49:05.080
They changed death to doom.

49:05.080 --> 49:07.560
They changed pubs to cafes.

49:07.560 --> 49:14.120
They changed holy to pearl, whatever, I guess you can't say the word holy, and some naughty

49:14.120 --> 49:17.400
bits were covered up, pixelated over.

49:17.400 --> 49:20.160
What's interesting is that there's a screenshot now floating around the internet from Final

49:20.160 --> 49:24.420
Fantasy VI Advance that shows a monster that was originally called Doomgaze in the Super

49:24.420 --> 49:29.880
Nintendo release, now given its proper name of Deathgaze, which sounds so much more hardcore.

49:29.880 --> 49:30.880
Oh my God.

49:30.880 --> 49:33.600
Are they actually going to give Tina the right name?

49:33.600 --> 49:37.960
That's interesting because this website that I'm looking at the story on siliconera.com

49:37.960 --> 49:39.960
actually poses the same question.

49:39.960 --> 49:41.640
Is Tara going to be Tina?

49:41.640 --> 49:42.640
Why did they change that?

49:42.640 --> 49:43.640
I don't know.

49:43.640 --> 49:44.640
I have no idea.

49:44.640 --> 49:47.400
Tara's, you know, because Tina's such a bad word.

49:47.400 --> 49:50.780
Maybe is it because Tina sounds more American than Tara?

49:50.780 --> 49:51.780
I don't know.

49:51.780 --> 49:55.160
Yeah, for anyone who doesn't know, Tara's original name in the Japanese Final Fantasy

49:55.160 --> 49:56.160
VI was Tina.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.160
Oh wait, no.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.160
I guess there's no way around.

49:58.160 --> 49:59.160
That's all right.

49:59.160 --> 50:02.160
I've played the Japanese one.

50:02.160 --> 50:03.160
So I'm sorry.

50:03.160 --> 50:04.160
Yeah.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.160
I guess it was Tara here.

50:05.160 --> 50:08.040
Were they going for maybe the double entendre where Tara is kind of like Earth?

50:08.040 --> 50:09.040
I don't know.

50:09.040 --> 50:10.040
Maybe.

50:10.040 --> 50:11.040
I don't know.

50:11.040 --> 50:12.040
Seems a little silly.

50:12.040 --> 50:16.500
It's just like the whole Aerith thing, isn't it?

50:16.500 --> 50:21.520
Aerith makes more sense, but then again, if you translate it by the Kana, it would kind

50:21.520 --> 50:25.240
of, Aerith would also make sense for translation purposes.

50:25.240 --> 50:31.000
Well, one thing that Jamie probably uses to do her translation is several websites out

50:31.000 --> 50:34.800
there on the internet, and certainly she likes to surf the internet up and down and back

50:34.800 --> 50:39.320
and forth every week finding her favorites of the internet, and it makes up Dark Sakura's

50:39.320 --> 50:40.400
Website of the Week.

50:40.400 --> 50:46.200
Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers this week?

50:46.200 --> 50:49.240
You should actually be going to PayPal and send me money.

50:49.240 --> 50:50.560
Oh wait, no.

50:50.560 --> 50:51.560
Really.

50:51.560 --> 50:52.560
And it's not a Doctor Who site.

50:52.560 --> 50:53.560
Okay.

50:53.560 --> 50:57.560
I'll do one next week, geez.

50:57.560 --> 51:00.920
A website of the week is massagetherapy.com.

51:00.920 --> 51:07.620
I've been spending a lot of time there because I'm in school to be a massage therapist.

51:07.620 --> 51:11.920
It's really good though because it has a lot about learning about massage, finding a massage

51:11.920 --> 51:16.040
therapist for your own needs and media.

51:16.040 --> 51:23.200
One thing that I really think is cool in here is there's a body work glossary in here that

51:23.200 --> 51:29.840
lists out a lot of different things you might hear as far as naturopathy, different type

51:29.840 --> 51:34.280
of health related things, I think it's really cool.

51:34.280 --> 51:40.120
I've learned actually a lot of different modalities just reading through the freaking glossary.

51:40.120 --> 51:44.480
So if anyone is into, even if you're not a massage therapist, even if you don't receive

51:44.480 --> 51:47.760
a massage, you're trained in natural health, it's really worth looking through and it's

51:47.760 --> 51:51.040
been very, very educational to me.

51:51.040 --> 51:57.720
SSJ100 Matt says, Jamie, there's no happy ending section.

51:57.720 --> 52:01.880
People who give happy endings are not real massage therapists.

52:01.880 --> 52:07.400
Now is that massagetherapist.com or massagetherapist.com?

52:07.400 --> 52:09.200
Massage therapy.

52:09.200 --> 52:11.800
I don't think that's very funny since this is my chosen profession.

52:11.800 --> 52:12.800
A joke, Jamie.

52:12.800 --> 52:13.800
It's a little joke.

52:13.800 --> 52:16.000
I don't think it's a funny joke because it's funny for the rest of my life.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
I thought it was funny.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
He thought it was funny.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
Have a little humor.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Are you either of you massage therapists?

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
No.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
Okay.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
But if you want me to give you a massage, I'll try.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
No.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.360
You might need a little massage.

52:26.360 --> 52:28.320
Your panties seem like they're in a bunch tonight.

52:28.320 --> 52:29.320
You know what?

52:29.320 --> 52:30.320
I'm going to throw this at you.

52:30.320 --> 52:34.520
I think you need an ass massage to get out all those ruffles in your panties because

52:34.520 --> 52:35.760
you're quite feathered tonight.

52:35.760 --> 52:37.920
I'll take the rapist for five minutes.

52:37.920 --> 52:38.920
Yes.

52:38.920 --> 52:39.920
Loki got it.

52:39.920 --> 52:40.920
It was a Saturday Night Live reference.

52:40.920 --> 52:45.240
Anyway, all kidding aside, you may think at first glance that this has nothing to do with

52:45.240 --> 52:46.280
gaming, but I say, you know what?

52:46.280 --> 52:50.640
If your ass starts to feel numb from so much hardcore gaming or your backs are... Maybe

52:50.640 --> 52:52.560
massage therapy is for you.

52:52.560 --> 52:54.560
You know what I've noticed?

52:54.560 --> 53:03.360
Actually, since I've started doing massage, as in giving massage, my endurance in cardiovascular

53:03.360 --> 53:08.200
work, aerobics, has greatly improved.

53:08.200 --> 53:12.320
Receiving a massage is just as healthy as receiving one if you do it the right way.

53:12.320 --> 53:13.840
It's good for everybody.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.600
All right.

53:15.600 --> 53:24.120
Anyways, speaking of unhappy endings, apparently there's actually going to be a price increase

53:24.120 --> 53:28.400
sort of in the Canadian PlayStation 3s.

53:28.400 --> 53:33.200
Wait, a price increase for the PlayStation 3?

53:33.200 --> 53:35.920
Somebody screwed up somewhere big time.

53:35.920 --> 53:43.560
Someone apparently listened to our contest that we had with the PlayStation 3.

53:43.560 --> 53:44.560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:44.560 --> 53:45.560
Make your own slogan.

53:45.560 --> 53:53.080
Anyways, yeah, so there is going to be a slight price increase coming for the PlayStation

53:53.080 --> 53:54.080
3.

53:54.080 --> 53:58.400
In Canada, the unit's going to cost about $50 more, and I don't think it's in Canadian

53:58.400 --> 53:59.400
dollars.

53:59.400 --> 54:01.000
It says for a total of $699.99.

54:01.000 --> 54:09.200
It says both Best Buy and Future Shop have the console listed at the new price.

54:09.200 --> 54:13.120
The old list price used to be $659.99.

54:13.120 --> 54:17.000
Hasn't the console already been out there for some time?

54:17.000 --> 54:22.360
I guess that they're increasing price, but here's my thing, though.

54:22.360 --> 54:27.840
I don't know if they're having the same situation as we are here, but if the consoles are rare

54:27.840 --> 54:31.280
maybe they're just raising prices because they can probably sell them for that, right?

54:31.280 --> 54:36.840
At least they're on a free game, geez, that's silly, because you know Canada sometimes gets

54:36.840 --> 54:41.360
bundle packs that we don't get here.

54:41.360 --> 54:46.920
But yeah, I guess whatever the case is, they're getting hosed over there.

54:46.920 --> 54:53.000
Well, we don't mean to keep picking on Sony, but look guys, they just keep giving us material.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
What can we say?

54:54.000 --> 54:59.480
Major Nelson over from Microsoft's camp was very quick to point out this week that Sony

54:59.480 --> 55:02.520
made a big fat boo-boo on one of their sites.

55:02.520 --> 55:07.160
There was a PSP site touting video downloads, and one of the video downloads was for Gran

55:07.160 --> 55:11.120
Turismo HD concept, was one of the things you could download, try to get people psyched

55:11.120 --> 55:12.760
about the PlayStation 3.

55:12.760 --> 55:18.800
Well, they had a screenshot on the website from Gran Turismo HD, but oops, it wasn't

55:18.800 --> 55:22.040
actually a screenshot of Gran Turismo HD.

55:22.040 --> 55:27.160
It was a screenshot of Project Gotham Racing 3 on Xbox 360.

55:27.160 --> 55:30.040
Talk about a fuck-up.

55:30.040 --> 55:34.360
You know that that's just some tiny little mistake some intern probably made somewhere,

55:34.360 --> 55:39.680
but still, where was the QA on that?

55:39.680 --> 55:42.160
Something got screwed up big time.

55:42.160 --> 55:47.940
In the follow-up with that story I was just talking about, according to a Sony rep, that

55:47.940 --> 55:52.480
is the actual case, that it says, although the suggested retail price of the PlayStation

55:52.480 --> 55:56.520
3 in Canada has not changed, some Canadian retailers have chosen to increase their retail

55:56.520 --> 55:59.600
price as a result of the weaker Canadian dollar.

55:59.600 --> 56:04.120
This increases solely at the discretion of the retailer, as Sony Computer Entertainment

56:04.120 --> 56:06.360
Canada has not issued a price increase.

56:06.360 --> 56:11.000
Thank you for the clarification, that makes more sense, thank you.

56:11.000 --> 56:16.400
I like our chatroom comments, GS68 pokes fun at the Ridge Racer phenomenon going, it's

56:16.400 --> 56:21.200
Project Gotham, Project Gotham, get it?

56:21.200 --> 56:24.840
I know it doesn't have the same thing to it, but I see what he did there, that's pretty

56:24.840 --> 56:25.840
good.

56:25.840 --> 56:26.840
Hmm.

56:26.840 --> 56:31.920
Well, Sony still though, they still have something shoved up their ass I think.

56:31.920 --> 56:34.960
Yeah, you remember us talking about that Ghostbusters game?

56:34.960 --> 56:35.960
I do.

56:35.960 --> 56:46.000
Well, um, Zoofly did confirm that they were preliminary working on one for Xbox 360.

56:46.000 --> 56:55.280
Sony Pictures, however, has pretty much told Zoofly to shut up, pretty much, you know,

56:55.280 --> 56:59.080
they've removed the content from their website because of Sony.

56:59.080 --> 57:07.080
Any of the content on YouTube has been removed, maybe that just was a breach of NDA, you think?

57:07.080 --> 57:11.360
Heaven forbid someone put something out there that got people excited for Sony.

57:11.360 --> 57:17.320
Or it could be the fact that Sony owns the rights to the Ghostbusters movies.

57:17.320 --> 57:22.680
Well, I don't know, whatever.

57:22.680 --> 57:24.200
Wasn't the game being created for Sony?

57:24.200 --> 57:29.520
No, it was being created by Zoofly, and they have to get everyone's permission, or they

57:29.520 --> 57:32.240
hadn't gotten the permission from any of the actors, or...

57:32.240 --> 57:35.720
But wasn't it being created by them for a Sony console?

57:35.720 --> 57:38.600
No, it was just being created by them because they like Ghostbusters.

57:38.600 --> 57:41.840
Oh, I totally misread that story the first time.

57:41.840 --> 57:42.840
That's alright.

57:42.840 --> 57:43.840
Interesting.

57:43.840 --> 57:44.840
Hmm.

57:44.840 --> 57:49.360
Well, yeah, okay, then I guess Sony was just protecting their rights.

57:49.360 --> 57:50.360
They're all within their rights.

57:50.360 --> 57:51.360
Ah, I get it.

57:51.360 --> 57:56.080
Well, still, it's never fun to hear about games going away that we were a little bit

57:56.080 --> 57:57.080
excited for.

57:57.080 --> 57:58.280
In fact, it makes us a little bit angsty.

57:58.280 --> 58:02.680
I don't know about you guys, but I get pretty pissed off when games I get excited for get

58:02.680 --> 58:07.520
cancelled, and that calls for some FUs of the week, right, boys and girls?

58:07.520 --> 58:08.520
Oh, yeah.

58:08.520 --> 58:09.520
I guess.

58:09.520 --> 58:28.840
The first FU of the week that I have goes towards the wear and tear on my car.

58:28.840 --> 58:33.560
I mean, really, it's not anything that I didn't expect.

58:33.560 --> 58:37.040
You drive your car on road trips, it's gonna wear out.

58:37.040 --> 58:40.280
It just, it was really kind of freaking me out last night.

58:40.280 --> 58:43.760
I didn't expect it to start grinding that suddenly.

58:43.760 --> 58:46.120
And of course, we shelled out 150 bucks for parts.

58:46.120 --> 58:51.840
Thankfully, we have a friend who can replace brakes, and brakes on the Mitsubishi Lancer

58:51.840 --> 58:54.640
are very easy to replace.

58:54.640 --> 58:55.640
But Rob...

58:55.640 --> 58:56.640
I'm not you.

58:56.640 --> 58:57.640
I'm thinking about something else.

58:57.640 --> 58:58.640
I'm thinking about...

58:58.640 --> 58:59.640
It's not related.

58:59.640 --> 59:00.640
Unlikely, Tori!

59:00.640 --> 59:04.480
Am I not allowed to laugh and have a good time at this show?

59:04.480 --> 59:06.480
I'm gonna talk to him about my car.

59:06.480 --> 59:07.480
No.

59:07.480 --> 59:08.480
You do that.

59:08.480 --> 59:19.120
So, yeah, a big, big major Uber FU goes to my car not being immortal, I guess.

59:19.120 --> 59:23.960
And another one goes to Rob for parking like an asshole.

59:23.960 --> 59:24.960
You know what?

59:24.960 --> 59:27.840
Because I had to pick your ass up because your car was in the shop.

59:27.840 --> 59:30.960
Had I not had to pick your ass up, I wouldn't have to repark the car.

59:30.960 --> 59:34.280
Rob, tell me, how many times have you been in the car with me when I've pulled into a

59:34.280 --> 59:36.560
spot and then backed up and adjusted my parking?

59:36.560 --> 59:38.900
I don't give a fuck!

59:38.900 --> 59:43.440
I had to contort myself to get out of your damn car.

59:43.440 --> 59:46.360
And no thank you for the ride or anything like that.

59:46.360 --> 59:48.320
You park like an asshole, you jerk.

59:48.320 --> 59:51.320
I thanked you for the ride when you picked me up and I gave you a cookie.

59:51.320 --> 59:52.320
I gave you cookies!

59:52.320 --> 59:54.040
Okay, the cookie was good.

59:54.040 --> 59:56.380
My cookies are great.

59:56.380 --> 01:00:00.040
My cookies bring all the Robs to my house.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.320
I'm bringing more cookies next week, too.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.320
Okay.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:08.440
Fuck, you did a superwoman that was in front of me when I was trying to get out of my apartment

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:15.040
complex today because she saw us behind her and she walked slower because she's a jackass.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:20.440
Also another thing, what the hell is the point, I'm looking at decalgirl.com and they have

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.960
a skin that you can buy for your PlayStation 3 that's black.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960
That's like stupid.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.360
Why the hell would I cover my PlayStation 3 with a skin that's the same color as the

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.380
goddamn PlayStation 3?

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.380
I don't know why.

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:35.480
I don't know because you're an idiot, I guess.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.480
So fuck them.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:42.060
I just want to give an F.U. of the week to my Saturday because it kind of sucked because

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:45.120
I had a migraine, which sucks, like they really suck.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:49.460
I don't get them very often when I do it really sucks and so I had that and then I got sick

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:54.680
off of dinner and you know, not that I had to perform on Saturday night or anything which

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.800
really pissed me off.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:02.360
So F.U. to mother nature for playing tricks on me on Saturday, it kind of pissed me off.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.200
And it ruined my game.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.600
The game of life.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:13.060
Speaking of the game of life, at least the game of our lives, ooh, food.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:20.520
Speaking of games, our favorite topic, at least it was in the last few years, Bomani.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.120
Bomani's turned 10.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:26.000
All those music game franchises, they're so old.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.320
Anyways, so to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Bomani, Konami is holding a pop music culture

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:37.920
festival at Tokyo's Laphorette Museum.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:43.040
So that's pretty awesome, you know, and lots of festivities going along with that, artists,

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:47.800
you know, performing, DJs, etc.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:53.320
And I'm sure I, like most people, had similar reactions where it's like, 10 years?

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.120
It's been 10 freaking years, god, I'm old.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.400
I know, seriously.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.440
I don't know about you guys, but that's my reaction to that.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:07.400
I remember, you know, when I first saw Bomani, you know, I remember it was at Fanime, and

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:14.760
we went up to one of the rooms that was there, and they were playing Beatmania on a Playstation,

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:21.040
and they were playing, I remember the song too, it was the Melger Solid theme, and I

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.560
was just like, fucking A, that's awesome.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.080
I was like, I gotta buy this.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:30.880
So I did, and I played it, and I stopped playing it, and then next time I saw DDR4th Mix, and

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.400
I was like, ooh, I gotta get that too.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.920
And then next thing you know, I'm going to arcades and I meet these crazy people, and

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:44.120
they're doing a radio show, and my life just spiraled downhill from there.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.080
What was your first Bomani?

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.280
The very first time I saw Bomani, I went to Milpitas Golf Land to play golf, and I saw

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.400
a bunch of people dancing on the machine, it looked like fun because I was playing Buster

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:58.360
Groove 2 on the Playstation at the time.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.440
So I did not know anything about Japanese imports at the time, so I was playing Buster

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.440
Groove 2.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.520
I'm giving you, part of me is, the other part of my heart's breaking.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.920
Well, let it break.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.920
You're too sassy tonight.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.920
I know.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.840
You need to, I'm being real with you tonight.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.840
I'm giving that angst right back at you tonight.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.840
I like it.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:20.840
I know you do.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.280
Let's see, so yeah, that was the first time I ever saw it, but there were so many people

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.280
there.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.760
I think there was a tournament going on or something, but we couldn't play it.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.800
So the first time I actually played was at a Rocky Horror Picture Show convention in

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.800
Las Vegas.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:40.360
I played at Circus Circus with an iguana girl who ended up going on to be some big admin

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.880
over at that DDR Freak site, but I don't think she really plays much anymore, so that was

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:46.880
my first game.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.600
I don't play admin much anymore either, but my first was, and you're going to laugh at

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:56.640
this, was when I still lived in Alabama playing BM 98.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.640
You remember BM 98?

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.640
Look, he left the room.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.640
I'm stealing a french fry.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.640
Give me one too.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.640
You want one too?

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.640
Okay.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.640
Give me his toast.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.640
You want his piece of toast?

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.640
Here you go.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.640
Here's a fry.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.640
Shh, don't tell.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.640
Okay, yes.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.640
BM 98, yeah?

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:10.640
Uh huh.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:16.040
BM 98 was awesome because it was a customizable, it was one of, I think it was honestly one

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:23.920
of the precursors to many of our simulators today, and you know, so I got to play a lot

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:31.480
of the early Beatmania songs probably right around, actually yeah, 1998, and then my first

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:43.960
DDR was playing the first Mixhome one when I moved out here from Alabama, and then I

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:47.280
played my first actual machine at.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.280
Don't glare at me.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.280
She took one too.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.080
Rob took it for me though.

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.160
Is that my 7-Up?

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.160
Is that my 7-Up?

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.160
Then I get a fry.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.160
Oh, I don't care if you're eating my food.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.120
Rob, go get me a root beer.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.000
Do I look like your bitch?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Yes.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.160
Rob wants to go get me a root beer.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:13.680
That's awesome, but I honestly think that the simulators like BM 98 got a lot of people

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:21.080
in the very early days of Bimani into these games who might not have otherwise had access

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.360
to them.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:28.340
I remember trying to make a file a long last time ago for BM 98 and I just couldn't do

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:34.560
it because I got really bored doing it, and from what I understand actually, it's sort

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:40.240
of seeing a resurgence in fan communities, I think that's kind of cool.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:44.680
My favorite though has to be Delight Delight Reduplication.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.640
I still have that somewhere.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:52.800
I remember how awesome it was when Dance with Intensity came out and was just like, wow,

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:58.560
this is so much better, and then Step Media came out and that was pretty cool too, but

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.680
who'd have thought.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:05.060
Although slightly related to the family of Bimani games is one of the really horrid games

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:10.480
that I think Konami should disavow any knowledge of, and that's Dance Dance Dance.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.920
It was shitty.

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.800
In my professional opinion, as an internet celebrity.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.120
Don't you hate it when you think of good ideas, like right when you get back in the chair

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:24.200
and somebody in the chat room actually said it, Bandit says, bet he shakes the can.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:30.600
That would have been an awesome idea, especially because Jamie's working on her laptop.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.600
She would have cried.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:36.400
No, I would have picked up my destroyed laptop and thrown it at your PC.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:41.600
That would have been a fun show, suddenly we're knocked off air.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:45.060
And then Jeremy Todd One would like to point this out.

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:50.160
He sent this to me in a message there in the chat room, and he's sent me a little slip

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.120
from YouParkLikeAnAsshole.com, although I'd like to point out he didn't even see it, Jeremy

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.120
Todd One.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.120
Oh yeah.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:00.880
He checked off two spots, one car, a little too close, over the painted lines, diagonal

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:05.120
parking, cool car, diagonal parking, not so cool car, and then he checked off other for

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.120
sucking.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.120
For sucking.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.120
I hate you.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.120
You know what?

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.420
DMN agrees with us, agrees with me and Jeremy Todd One, by the way.

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:16.000
For this, Jeremy Todd One gets a kick from the chat room, we'll just do that, control

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.280
kick, there we go, nice good kick from the chat room.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:22.800
DMN wanted me to punch you in the arm, and he gave me a heart if I did it, so I'm gonna

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.800
punch Robin.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.640
No, I got you a gun, ow!

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.640
You're a real bitch tonight.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.640
I am not, I'm nice.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:35.120
I gave you cookies.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.120
It's always the cookies.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.120
It always comes back to the cookies.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.000
I know, you did it all for the cookie.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.400
All right, did everybody have fun reminiscing about the Bemani?

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.240
Yes, and thank you for my root beer.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.240
You're welcome.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.120
All right, Harmonics talked this week a little bit about something that's not Bemani related,

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:53.360
because you know, Harmonics didn't make Bemani, but certainly they're a huge, huge player

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:57.080
in the music video game franchise, and they are talking about the guitar.

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.800
Technically, they did kind of work on Bemani.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:04.040
Oh, that's true, Karaoke Revolution, I stand corrected, so they have dabbled in Bemani

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.040
a little bit.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:09.720
Well, and that was definitely two forces coming together, that was pretty cool.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.840
Yeah, what a fucking monster that made.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:18.240
Anywho, one of the folks that works over at Harmonics, and that would be Daniel Sussman,

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.400
who is a producer over at Harmonics, quote, here's the official line, Harmonics can confirm

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:26.960
that we are not developing Guitar Hero 3, and that backs up the story from last week

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.880
about Neversoft, who did the Tony Hawk games, are taking over that.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.440
He also said this, quote, we are instead working on a different music game project, one that

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:41.600
is bigger and more ambitious endeavor than we felt we could pursue with the balance of

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.120
the Guitar Hero franchise.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:48.600
Further specific details on exact subject and publisher from the game are not yet released.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.760
We'll see.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.580
You know, I'm thinking though, a lot of people are going, oh, it's Guitar Hero, or it's Guitar

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:58.920
Villain, or it's Drum Hero, or it's Keyboard Hero, or it's a sequel to Amplitude of Frequency.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:03.560
I think when this guy uses terms like, we are working on a different music game project

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:07.000
that is bigger and more ambitious, I think it's bigger than all that.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I think it's different.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.440
I think it's something brand new you haven't even thought of yet that Harmonics is working

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.440
on.

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.440
I think it's called Huge Ass Symphony, the game.

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.120
I think it's just some new concept we don't even know yet until we hear it.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.300
I think it's Oonga Boonga, the musical.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:22.240
It's Guns and Roses, the game, an ego bigger than Axl Rose.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:28.720
Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, at least for Guitar Hero 2 for Xbox Live, the multiplayer

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:34.240
dream has crashed and burned.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:39.680
The guitar still has the microphone in it too, but there's no online multiplayer.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:46.640
All of the modes, co-op face-off, pro face-off modes are offline only, so, sorry y'all.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.160
Yeah, it's gotta be lag.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.680
I'm pretty much thinking so.

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:57.600
But I still think it's cool though, you know, the downloadable packs, because that, it really

01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:03.580
gives the experience very similar, I think, to Karaoke Revolution on Xbox, but it really

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:10.480
gives the game a really, I'd say, a lot of replayability.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.920
They should just add, well, I'm sure they'll have a leaderboard.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.320
They need the war pack.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:17.520
So that's what they just need to do, stick with the leaderboard.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.240
You know, I've given Guitar Hero a little bit of crap on this show, just because I don't

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.880
foam at the mouth over it like everyone else does, I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Guitar

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.760
Hero, it's so awesome, and I actually prefer it to Guitar Freaks, I really do, which for

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.400
somebody with a Bomani, you know, a heart Konami type thing is a huge thing to say.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.400
I know, look.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.440
It bypasses your Bomani boner?

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.960
Kind of, in the guitar region it does.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:44.980
I would, you know, I would have five hard-ons somehow if they would make a keyboard game

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.320
like they did Guitar Hero.

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.960
I really would, because I'd love to have keyboard mania.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:51.280
You would probably be Edward Penis Hands.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.280
Probably.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.880
I don't know how it would happen.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.720
That's a reference I hadn't heard in forever.

01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:01.500
I would totally be happy if they would do that, but I am getting more and more excited

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.720
about its release on the 360.

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.840
I'm pumped for it, I'm going to definitely pick it out when it comes, or pick it up when

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.840
it comes out.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.420
What about DDR on the 360?

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:13.120
You know what, I looked at some, there's some new videos that hit the internet this week,

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.540
and I think it looks great.

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:15.800
I'm really excited about it.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.960
I think it's going to be an awesome game.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.240
I think my neighbors are going to hate me.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:22.440
Mine are going to hate me too, and I finally need to get my dance pad back from Jamie.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.960
She's had it for like a year and a half.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.160
I gave, no, I gave it back to you.

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.160
I don't, no, no, you took-

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.160
One of the steps didn't work.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.600
No, no, that was the old dance pad.

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.520
You took my other one, because remember when there was a Guitar Hero story?

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.520
It was in the background.

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.400
No, you took that back with you.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.400
I gave it back to you.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.400
No, I don't have it.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.280
Well, then it's probably in the vault.

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.060
She forgot to tell you that she sold it for a pinball machine.

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.060
She probably did.

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.100
No, Dan sold it for a pinball machine.

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.720
She sold it for a pinball- Dude, we got another freaking pinball machine,

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:46.720
by the way.

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.720
We got an Earthshaker.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.720
Anyway.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.600
I haven't even fucking heard of that.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.680
The Rosie O'Donnell pinball machine, the Earthshaker.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.200
Actually Earthshaker is in the same family as Roland, it's pretty old school and awesome.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.160
One of those machines that collectors want, anyway.

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:08.480
I still want my Doctor Who pinball machine, and Dan hasn't accommodated me.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:13.360
Joshi16 has an interesting line in chat, what would Brian Boitano do?

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.320
Get all the developers in town and make a game to amaze the noobs.

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.600
That's what Brian Boitano would do.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.600
I tried to sing it.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.600
That's fantastic.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.640
It failed miserably because I had no voice.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.640
That's okay.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.640
You haven't excused this time.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.640
I do.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:31.680
Oh, this is exciting when Dark Soccer is letting me have not just one, but two buys tonight.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.800
I got one for Bust a Groove 2, and I got another for my voice.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:36.800
I'm excited.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.440
And you were calling me a bitch.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.680
If the shoe fits.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.200
Very accommodating, Rob.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.480
I only punched you because DMN told me to.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.200
Well, DMN's a bitch too.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.160
He is, but we like his bitchiness.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.300
You know there's nothing but heart for the Jamie.

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:54.620
Nothing but heart.

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.000
The bleeding heart.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
There's a heart.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Alright.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
With a knife through it.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.760
We're going to go to a quick break here and come back in a little bit with Orange

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.000
Lounge Radio Part B because Jamie and I have to have a hug-a-thon to make up for all the

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.840
fighting we're doing tonight, so we're going to have a hug-a-thon during the break.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.200
So we'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:17.320
For those of you guys listening on our audio archive, also known as podcasting, we'll be

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:21.160
back in a couple days, probably about Wednesday-ish, with Part B.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.920
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.920
a week.

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:39.880
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
