14000	20000	Tonight, January 28th, 2007, Wii gets a new channel and rumors circulate of another,
20000	26000	Sony gets confused about its own game, and a new PC release shatters sales records.
26000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	42000	We are that video game podcast dedicated to video games, the gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	46000	I'm here to help you through the next few hours. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.
46000	50000	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
50000	54000	Roar. How you doing? Roar.
54000	58000	Do you need to be fed? Should I throw you some meat?
58000	64000	No, no, no. I just had an awesome, awesome night and a really crappy morning.
64000	70000	I'm glad to hear about your awesome night and I'm sad to hear about your crappy morning.
70000	72000	I'm sure we'll hear more about it a little later.
72000	74000	The Silver Lancer of Love is in the hospital.
74000	77000	So your car is broke. What happened to your car?
77000	82000	The bearings have some problems. It's not really the bearings themselves, just their grinding a little bit.
82000	84000	It was in my car last night. You heard it. It was pretty bad.
84000	87000	But we replaced my rotors, calipers, and the brakes.
87000	92000	See, what we did there was a little radio trick because the listeners don't know that I was in your car last night,
92000	95000	but it's a way for me to get you to talk about the problem because they don't know what's wrong with your car.
95000	100000	I know, but I was saying it for the sake of the noise that it was making.
100000	101000	It was pretty bad. It was pretty bad.
101000	105000	The death noise. You want to know what death metal is? Just let your brakes grind.
105000	108000	I thought her tire was flat, actually, is what I thought it was.
108000	112000	And then I got out of the car and I poked all the tires and they were fine. I said,
112000	113000	You're fucked.
113000	114000	Rob probed my car.
114000	115000	I did.
115000	116000	It was great.
116000	118000	You're the one who had the probe.
118000	122000	Say hello as well to the always probing tech master, Loki.
122000	123000	Hello.
123000	125000	You might want to turn that mic on so you can talk to us tonight.
125000	126000	Hello.
126000	127000	Hey, how you doing?
127000	128000	Good.
128000	131000	217 weeks, we're still having difficulty turning on our microphone.
131000	133000	Yeah, I don't check these things.
133000	135000	I turned it off, too. I was the one that did that.
135000	136000	How was your week?
136000	138000	You had a pretty good week?
138000	139000	Yeah, it was okay.
139000	140000	It was good.
140000	143000	I apologize in advance. I've kind of lost my voice somewhat tonight.
143000	145000	You're going to hear that my voice is kind of scratching.
145000	147000	I'm doing my best trying to drink some tea and coffee,
147000	151000	but those folks that have emailed us or posted on web forums that,
151000	153000	Rob talks too much on the show.
153000	155000	Rob should shut up once in a while.
155000	158000	You're probably going to get your wish tonight because, as you can hear,
158000	159000	I'm strained a little bit.
159000	161000	We've got some emergency for you.
161000	163000	I know. I'm probably going to drink some a little later, but my throat,
163000	166000	you know, I need hot drinks for the throat, so I've been drinking some green tea.
166000	167000	Boil it.
167000	168000	I will make some coffee later.
168000	171000	Boil it. It will be lovely and nasty.
171000	173000	I might try it. We'll see. I can drink whatever.
173000	178000	Yeah, I've been performing with a Rocky Horror Picture Show cast in the Bay Area,
178000	183000	and I was emceeing the show last night, introducing everybody out in San Francisco
183000	185000	and just screaming at the top of my lungs.
185000	188000	So that was kind of a stupid thing to do because now I have no voice.
188000	190000	So my bad. What can you do?
190000	193000	All right. Well, anyway, let's get into some game talk,
193000	196000	and we'll start it off with how is your gaming week,
196000	198000	because we always start off the show with how is your gaming week.
198000	201000	So Dark Soccer, how is your gaming week?
201000	203000	I played a little bit more Cooking Mama.
203000	207000	I haven't really had time to play much of anything as far as actual games go,
207000	211000	although I'm really thinking I'm going to actually stick with Guild Wars
211000	213000	for my game of choice.
213000	217000	I might play World of Warcraft, but right now I really don't have time with school.
217000	219000	My education really is the focus.
219000	224000	But last night I was over here while Rob was off in Rocky Land,
224000	229000	and I was watching a Miklotov play through Silent Hill 2, which was awesome,
229000	231000	but it wasn't scary to me.
231000	233000	There's only, like, one thing that really freaked me out,
233000	235000	and I don't even remember what that was.
235000	239000	I think it was climbing down the ladder and having Pyramid Head just be there,
239000	244000	and that spooked me a little bit.
244000	245000	That was really it.
245000	247000	Oh, and I played some Pinball.
247000	248000	I downloaded a game from my phone, though.
248000	252000	I downloaded Pac-Man Pinball, and it's ass.
252000	253000	What's wrong with it?
253000	254000	It's just boring.
254000	255000	It's not very...
255000	257000	It's two fields, and that's it.
257000	259000	Is it just a normal Pinball game, like hit left and right?
259000	260000	Yeah.
260000	261000	Stupid.
261000	262000	Sounds boring.
262000	265000	Like, they should do, like, virtual Pinball for the phone so I can play Black Knight.
265000	266000	Are there cell phone games you enjoy?
266000	268000	Because there's only, like, one or two I enjoy.
268000	273000	I have two that I play, and that's Luminous and Bejeweled.
273000	277000	The only two I play are Luminous and Super Pac-Man.
277000	280000	You know, Super Pac-Man's really hard to play on my phone.
280000	284000	I would much rather play it, excuse me, on an arcade machine or something,
284000	287000	but, you know, it's not bad for on the go.
287000	289000	I did delete virtual Pinball off of my computer
289000	291000	because it turned out that I had no space left,
291000	293000	and I managed to free up 17 gig.
293000	294000	Jesus.
294000	295000	Oh, yeah.
295000	296000	17 gigs.
296000	298000	On a 250 gigabyte hard drive.
298000	301000	It's all that, all the TV I'm downloading.
301000	304000	Thanks to certain people who are trying to get me into watching Heroes.
304000	305000	It worked.
305000	306000	Bite my ass.
306000	309000	I'm going to also introduce our invisible fourth guest
309000	311000	who's always here with us every week.
311000	313000	That's the chat room, because Orange Lounge Radio,
313000	315000	we believe in letting you guys be a part of our program.
315000	317000	So if you're listening live to us here on this Sunday evening,
317000	320000	head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.
320000	324000	Click on chat, or I believe you can also just go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
324000	326000	I think our lovely webmaster, VXJ's next V,
326000	328000	set that up quite some time ago,
328000	330000	and I keep forgetting to announce it that way.
330000	332000	I want to say hi to the noobs.
332000	336000	I know Godlike93 introduced himself as a chat room noob tonight,
336000	338000	so hi, noob!
338000	340000	I think I recognize all the other names.
340000	343000	If I missed any other noobs in chat tonight, I apologize.
343000	345000	The chat room is pretty much being very foul
345000	347000	as to why I have no voice tonight.
347000	350000	NM64 said Sky ate too many dicks.
350000	351000	Screw you.
351000	352000	Screw you.
352000	354000	I just screamed a lot.
354000	356000	I said the F word repeatedly very loudly,
356000	359000	and that's why I have no voice today.
359000	363000	Of course, that doesn't really help that story, does it?
363000	364000	No, it does not.
364000	365000	Never mind.
365000	367000	I think I want to edit that out of the show,
367000	368000	but we don't do that.
368000	370000	All right, Lowkey.
370000	371000	How was your gaming week?
371000	373000	My gaming week was fun.
373000	374000	We played...
374000	376000	I actually finished Resistance finally,
376000	378000	and the end's kind of okay.
378000	380000	They're definitely making another one.
380000	382000	Didn't get a chance to play multiplayer, though.
382000	384000	I should have done that,
384000	387000	but I was too busy playing Crackdown, the demo,
387000	392000	and I played that about six or seven times
392000	393000	all the way through,
393000	396000	so that's over three hours of Crackdown,
396000	398000	and it's a fun game.
398000	401000	It's exactly what I was hoping it would be.
401000	403000	I mean, it's a perfect game for me
403000	405000	because you're this overpowered,
405000	407000	almost like a superhero-type character
407000	409000	just abusing the crap out of the citizens
409000	412000	that live in this one city.
412000	415000	And then I did get to play last night
415000	418000	multiplayer with Jeremy Todd 100,
418000	421000	and that was fun.
421000	423000	We just kept busting up
423000	425000	just how retarded things got.
425000	427000	I kind of couldn't get into the Crackdown demo,
427000	430000	but I played it when I didn't have a lot of time
430000	431000	to spend with it,
431000	432000	but you and I need to set a time
432000	433000	so you can show me what the hell
433000	434000	I'm supposed to do in that game
434000	436000	because it looks like it's pretty.
436000	437000	It looks like it might be fun.
437000	438000	When you actually sit down
438000	439000	and look at some of the detailing,
439000	441000	I mean, there's a lot of cars and people,
441000	444000	which is a lot more than, say,
444000	446000	Saints Row or something like that.
446000	449000	I do like just the amount of detail in it
449000	451000	and just the fact that when you're not
451000	453000	going around and trying to kill people,
453000	455000	you can climb a lot of stuff in there,
455000	457000	and that's actually kind of fun also.
457000	459000	It's kind of a different aspect of the game.
459000	461000	They reward you for that too.
461000	462000	In fact, one of the achievements
462000	466000	is climbing the tower that you start off in,
466000	467000	and that thing is high.
467000	469000	I managed to get up about,
469000	471000	I don't know, 20, 30, 40 stories,
471000	474000	and they jumped off of it and landed on a cop.
474000	476000	To my enjoyment,
476000	479000	we both exploded once I hit the ground.
479000	482000	But it was, I don't know,
482000	485000	it's really, really fun,
485000	488000	just a lot of killing things.
488000	490000	I'm worried that it might be a little short.
490000	493000	I'm not sure just because it seemed like
493000	494000	you could run through it pretty quick,
494000	498000	and if I've already killed three of the
498000	503000	kind of gang leaders in this already in 30 minutes.
503000	505000	Wasn't there some footnote in the demo
505000	507000	that said it was moving at an accelerated pace?
507000	509000	Well, the leveling up.
509000	511000	The skills were moving a bit faster,
511000	513000	but if you spend time with it leveling up,
513000	516000	you just kick the crap out of everybody later on,
516000	518000	which is fine because it's fun.
518000	520000	But co-op is definitely where it's at.
520000	523000	I really wish it was more than two players,
523000	525000	but even what was kind of weird,
525000	527000	though, when you're playing co-op,
527000	531000	there was lag, but there was lag on my end.
531000	534000	I would move and it would be delayed on my screen,
534000	536000	which is kind of weird, but it was fun.
536000	539000	I liked it, so I can't wait to check out the full game.
539000	541000	Alright, is that it?
541000	543000	I think that's it, yeah.
543000	545000	My game movie wasn't that exciting either.
545000	547000	Not a whole lot of new stuff to play.
547000	549000	I did play Luminous because the Heavenly Stars skin
549000	550000	came out this week, and of course,
550000	553000	that's one of my all-time favorite songs in Luminous,
553000	556000	probably like Shining and then Heavenly Stars.
556000	558000	So I was very excited to hear that it was coming
558000	560000	to the Xbox Live Arcade, and it's really cool.
560000	563000	It looks great on the TV, and it's a good time.
563000	566000	The only thing is that I think the mode that they made for it,
566000	568000	like they have a Heavenly Star mode,
568000	570000	where basically you just play the same song
570000	572000	over and over and over again, is kind of pointless.
572000	574000	I think it kind of proves that putting Heavenly Stars
574000	576000	in the game was a bit of an afterthought.
576000	578000	I think it's kind of weird that Heavenly Stars
578000	580000	is the only song available right now, too.
580000	582000	Don't you remember at E3 there was supposed to be Madonna,
582000	584000	and they were talking about they were getting together
584000	587000	Warner Brothers Records to get all these songs.
587000	588000	Where did those show up?
588000	589000	Because I think it would have been better
589000	593000	if they released a few of those for, I don't know,
593000	595000	400 points or whatever, released several of those,
595000	598000	and had a mode for that, like music video mode.
598000	600000	Because the only place that Heavenly Stars really works
600000	602000	for me is using it in skin edit mode.
602000	603000	And when I'm playing it in skin edit mode,
603000	604000	I don't really play the whole song,
604000	607000	because you move on to the next skin after four levels,
607000	609000	and I'm actually getting better at Luminous,
609000	610000	so I can usually get through four levels
610000	612000	at about half the song.
612000	615000	But I can't complain, it's free.
615000	620000	And I applaud Microsoft and Q Entertainment
620000	623000	for trying to correct some of the microtransaction mistakes
623000	625000	they made by making this content so cheap right now,
625000	628000	and applauding the early adopters and everything.
628000	629000	So it's really hard to complain.
629000	631000	I just think it could have been approached a little better.
631000	632000	That's all.
632000	633000	And I'm really looking forward
633000	635000	to seeing some additional content.
635000	637000	I would not want to see them do the Madonna song,
637000	639000	where you just play the Madonna mode over and over and over,
639000	641000	because it's all tracked separately and play history.
641000	643000	And it has separate ranking boards.
643000	644000	It's just a little much.
644000	646000	It's almost like there's too much.
646000	648000	Does that make sense?
648000	649000	Let's see.
649000	650000	The other game I played was World of Warcraft.
650000	652000	Honestly, I've been getting sucked back into World of Warcraft.
652000	654000	I'm a little torn druid now,
654000	656000	which I know some people are probably like,
656000	657000	I can do that in no time flat.
657000	658000	Well, you know what?
658000	659000	I have a job.
659000	661000	I have other stuff to do.
661000	663000	But I'm having a lot of fun with it,
663000	664000	and we've got a guild growing.
664000	666000	We have some OLR listeners in it.
666000	668000	We're over on the Ravencrest server.
668000	669000	If you want to join us,
669000	671000	check out the forums for more details.
671000	673000	We're not called OL Army, though.
673000	675000	It's a Silent Hill-based name, actually,
675000	676000	for whatever reason.
676000	677000	That's just Shane's running the guild,
677000	678000	and that's what he picked.
678000	679000	Miklotov.
679000	680000	You know him as Miklotov on the show.
680000	681000	That's what he picked.
681000	682000	And it's a good name for a Horde guild.
682000	684000	So, Horde side, Ravencrest.
684000	687000	Visit the Orange Honors Radio forums
687000	689000	for more detail at orangehonorsradio.com.
689000	690000	And that's it.
690000	691000	That's pretty much all my gaming week.
691000	692000	Not anything else major.
692000	694000	Just some other little bits here and there.
694000	695000	I think I might have played a game of Heavy Weapon.
695000	696000	That's about it.
696000	697000	Oh, yeah.
697000	698000	I played Heavy Weapon.
698000	699000	You didn't like it?
699000	700000	No, I thought it was stupid.
700000	701000	I thought it was way better
701000	703000	than most of the stuff they've been releasing lately.
703000	704000	Oh, that was dumb.
704000	705000	Really?
705000	707000	I'm glad I didn't buy it.
707000	709000	You know what I didn't get
709000	711000	that I'm actually surprised I didn't buy
711000	713000	is Zelda on Virtual Console,
713000	714000	because it's one of the games
714000	715000	I've really been waiting for,
715000	717000	but this is seriously what MMOs do to me,
717000	718000	is that I kind of don't care,
718000	719000	because I'm like,
719000	720000	oh, I got to level my druid,
720000	721000	or else I'm not going to be able
721000	723000	to stay on top with everybody else.
723000	724000	I need to get out of that mindset.
724000	725000	It's not healthy.
725000	726000	I just haven't bought it
726000	727000	because I already have them.
727000	728000	Yeah.
728000	729000	We did play R-Type.
729000	730000	Oh, yeah.
730000	731000	That's right.
731000	732000	You were over here playing R-Type.
732000	733000	I watched you play that last night.
733000	734000	How was that?
734000	735000	Yeah.
735000	736000	God, I suck at it.
736000	737000	I can't play it without the TurboGrafx controller.
737000	738000	Isn't it sad?
738000	740000	I don't know how many older gamers we have
740000	741000	that listen to this program.
741000	742000	I'd really like to hear from you guys,
742000	744000	but folks who were in grade school,
744000	746000	junior high, high school, whatever,
746000	748000	when 8-bit Nintendo was out,
748000	751000	and I remember being 10, 11, 12 years old
751000	753000	and breezing through some of these games
753000	755000	like Gradius and stuff,
755000	757000	and I tried to play Gradius the other night.
757000	758000	That is one of the games I played.
758000	761000	I played Gradius on Wii, and I sucked.
761000	763000	I couldn't get past the volcanoes in the first level
763000	765000	because I swore I was going to do it without cheating.
765000	768000	I can't go back and play Nintendo Gradius, though.
768000	771000	I have to play one of the later releases of it.
771000	774000	Does my hand-eye coordination get that bad with age?
774000	775000	You're just old, Rob.
775000	776000	I guess so.
776000	778000	Comments from Chat Room.
778000	779000	Jeremy Todd 1 says,
779000	781000	Everyone has to buy A Link to the Past.
781000	782000	I don't care who you are or what you do.
782000	783000	Buy it anyway.
783000	784000	This game is the best game ever.
784000	785000	I agree.
785000	789000	It's probably one of the top five games of all time.
789000	790000	Hitstun says,
790000	792000	Heavy Weapon is nice by PopCap standards,
792000	794000	but that doesn't make it a good game.
794000	796000	I disagree.
796000	798000	XBSkit adds onto that,
798000	800000	saying the PopCap standard is the bottom of the barrel
800000	801000	next to Flash games.
801000	802000	I don't know.
802000	804000	There's some pretty crappy stuff on Xbox Live
804000	805000	outside the PopCap stuff.
805000	807000	At least there's some playability there.
807000	808000	I don't know.
808000	809000	I disagree.
809000	810000	I don't think PopCap's the best thing ever, OMG,
810000	812000	but I think some of the stuff they put out
812000	813000	is pretty decent.
813000	814000	Bob Coffee says,
814000	816000	Don't give in to World of Warcraft.
816000	817000	Too late.
817000	818000	Alpha Canagram says,
818000	820000	Skye, I love Heavenly Star.
820000	823000	I'm just annoyed that I can't turn off the sound effects
823000	826000	because sometimes I want to hear the actual song while playing.
826000	827000	Yeah, you know how in Luminous,
827000	829000	you know with the songs in the background,
829000	831000	the little rotating the shapes will make a noise,
831000	833000	and clearing a block off the screen will make a noise?
833000	835000	Some of that does get in the way of the song,
835000	836000	but I don't find it.
836000	837000	I liked for Shining, though.
837000	838000	Wow.
838000	839000	Yeah, and Shining, it was incredible.
839000	841000	I don't mind it in Heavenly Star,
841000	843000	and I think in Hollaback Girl it's funny,
843000	845000	if you have the PSP one.
845000	848000	By the way, I saw Luminous Plus on PS2 for sale the other day,
848000	850000	and I remember what you were telling me
850000	852000	about how it went down in price, right?
852000	853000	Luminous Plus on PS2?
853000	855000	Yeah, it's $19.99.
855000	856000	It shouldn't be out, though.
856000	858000	It's not coming out until way later.
858000	861000	No, they had it on shelves at a place I went to at a GameStop,
861000	863000	which you're usually pretty good about.
863000	865000	Yeah, Luminous Plus doesn't come out until the end of next month.
865000	866000	For real?
866000	867000	I should have bought it.
867000	868000	I swear, they had like 40 copies
868000	870000	sitting right there on the shelf behind the little thing.
870000	871000	Luminous Plus.
871000	872000	Huh.
872000	874000	Maybe something happened.
874000	876000	Yeah, they shouldn't have that yet.
876000	877000	That's weird.
877000	879000	I'm going to check the web and see if it...
879000	881000	Maybe if they changed the price, they bumped up the release date.
881000	883000	I don't really want to get it on PS2, though.
883000	884000	That's too many versions.
884000	885000	I have Xbox Live.
885000	886000	That's good enough.
886000	888000	Then again, it would depend on the songs.
888000	890000	Do they have some good licensed song in Luminous Plus,
890000	892000	or is it just a port of the PSP version?
892000	893000	I think it's just a port of the PSP version.
893000	894000	Then forget it.
894000	895000	Forget it.
895000	896000	I don't care, then.
896000	902000	All right, let's go on and get into some other stuff for tonight's show.
902000	904000	We want to talk about some housekeeping tonight.
904000	906000	Not a whole lot going on with our show itself.
906000	909000	We want to talk about some of the other shows on our station.
909000	912000	Travis Donovan Live will not be live this upcoming Saturday,
912000	914000	so I don't know if there's going to be a rerun going on
914000	917000	or what exactly is going to be happening with that.
917000	919000	Also interesting to note, I guess on his last program,
919000	924000	Travis announced his candidacy for president in 2008.
924000	927000	So if you want to vote for an alternative,
927000	928000	I suppose you could always vote for Travis.
928000	930000	So if you want more details, listen to his show.
930000	934000	Saturday nights at 7 o'clock, but not this upcoming week.
934000	936000	DMN is going to call us later in the show
936000	938000	because they scored a huge interview for this week.
938000	939000	I'm pretty jealous.
939000	943000	And Jamie, you are going to be pissed when you find out who it is.
943000	944000	That's all I have to say.
944000	946000	You're going to be pissed that they're not on this show.
946000	947000	Okay.
947000	949000	You're going to want to reach through the screen and punch DMN.
949000	950000	Okay.
950000	951000	That's pretty good.
951000	952000	He'll call in later in the program.
952000	953000	Okay.
953000	956000	So keep an eye on that at www.orangelandtrader.com.
956000	957000	Okay.
957000	959000	Okay, I'm going to shove this mic up your ass now, okay?
959000	960000	Hey, Rob.
960000	961000	What?
961000	962000	Rob.
962000	963000	What?
963000	964000	Hi.
964000	965000	You expected me to say Rob a bunch of times, didn't you?
965000	966000	I know.
966000	967000	Well, you know what?
967000	968000	Let's let the joke die.
968000	969000	Step away from the joke.
969000	970000	No.
970000	971000	All right.
971000	975000	On a serious note, Dark Sakura wanted to start off tonight's program a little bit,
975000	978000	and we promised we wouldn't bring this story up again,
978000	980000	but Dark Sakura had something she wanted to say,
980000	982000	she wanted to talk about last week and us talking about it,
982000	984000	and I'll just turn it over to her.
984000	985000	So, Dark Sakura, what do you want to say?
985000	991000	Yeah, about the whole two-gallon water drowning lady.
991000	992000	Jennifer Strange, yes?
992000	993000	Yeah, sorry.
993000	994000	Hold your Wii for a week, KD&D.
994000	996000	I could only remember her last name for some reason.
996000	997000	Okay.
997000	998000	Well, it was pretty strange.
998000	1000000	I got all of three emails about it.
1000000	1004000	One of them was just stupid, and I immediately disregarded it
1004000	1006000	because if you want to make a valid point,
1006000	1009000	don't start off by calling people names and being an idiot
1009000	1012000	then I don't respect you and I will never pay attention to anything you say.
1012000	1014000	Was it like a fuck you, you fucking fuck type of email?
1014000	1018000	Yeah, I'm like, you're an idiot, next.
1018000	1023000	I did, however, receive one that really, I want to say,
1023000	1028000	was a well-thought-out letter, and I appreciate it,
1028000	1031000	and just because, and I'm going to go ahead and say this,
1031000	1036000	I am, God, chat room, knock it off, shit.
1036000	1038000	Oh, God.
1038000	1040000	Anyway, Rob, you should just kick everybody.
1040000	1042000	I do, I do.
1042000	1045000	Do your statement.
1045000	1051000	Anyway, what I was going to say before the chat room started acting like they had Tourette's
1051000	1053000	is that, you know, I couldn't go on when I was wrong.
1053000	1058000	I even went back and said, yeah, I don't think it was necessarily a matter of deserving it,
1058000	1063000	but I come from the point of view of accountability for what you do,
1063000	1066000	of people having a free will.
1066000	1069000	I apologize to anyone who might have been offended,
1069000	1072000	but my point of view still stands.
1072000	1077000	It's a matter of, you know, looking at how much warning was given.
1077000	1079000	There's still a lot of ambiguity regarding it,
1079000	1082000	so until I have proof that she was held down to the floor
1082000	1085000	and they forced water down her throat, I'm not going to feel as sorry for her.
1085000	1087000	I feel sorry for the kids.
1087000	1091000	I feel sorry for the family, but she did choose to do it,
1091000	1093000	so that's the point I'm standing on, and end of story,
1093000	1098000	but I do offer a public apology to anyone who might have been offended by my anger
1098000	1100000	because, honestly, if something like that happened to me,
1100000	1102000	I would not want to be made a victim.
1102000	1105000	I would want my accountability to go on record
1105000	1108000	because, you know, if I had to go ride a roller coaster
1108000	1112000	and I know the roller coaster could fall over by, you know, tornado,
1112000	1115000	and the tornado strikes and the roller coaster falls over,
1115000	1119000	I know when I die my horrible flaming death
1119000	1122000	that it was my choice to get on the roller coaster in the first place.
1122000	1124000	But what a way to go.
1124000	1126000	I know. Wouldn't that be awesome?
1126000	1129000	But a friend of mine equated it, though, with, you know,
1129000	1133000	if you're a woman going out at midnight to 7-11,
1133000	1136000	there's a chance that you can get pounced in the alleyway and raped.
1136000	1138000	Well, that's the difference.
1138000	1141000	She wasn't forced down onto the ground and forced water down her throat.
1141000	1144000	She actually chose to do it after there was warning calling in,
1144000	1146000	after they were saying, Do you feel sick?
1146000	1148000	Do you need to stop people talking about it?
1148000	1151000	So that's my point of view on it.
1151000	1153000	My blame...
1153000	1155000	See, people keep using blame.
1155000	1161000	Blame is stupid. I hate that word.
1161000	1164000	I don't blame her.
1164000	1168000	I just think that she had a choice, and that's what I'm saying.
1168000	1170000	I just don't think that people should discount the fact
1170000	1173000	that she did have free will involved.
1173000	1174000	And that's what people are doing.
1174000	1176000	Hopefully we can all get past this story
1176000	1179000	because I know, you know, I'm kind of sick of hearing about it,
1179000	1181000	especially living here, because keep in mind,
1181000	1184000	this was in our backyard, and we are hearing about this nonstop.
1184000	1186000	It's in our paper every day, some type of new development.
1186000	1190000	And top of that, I talked it over with several of my co-workers,
1190000	1192000	lots of my friends, and everyone's saying,
1192000	1194000	Did we learn about this in middle school?
1194000	1198000	You know, if you saturate your body with water without replacing sodium,
1198000	1201000	your brain's not going to function.
1201000	1203000	That you learn in middle school.
1203000	1207000	And for me, my whole thing is just that I don't...
1207000	1212000	Yeah, the radio station fully, they are fully responsible.
1212000	1214000	Well, not say fully responsible,
1214000	1217000	but they should be the ones punished for the event, not her.
1217000	1220000	I think that, you know, what happened to her is a horrible tragedy.
1220000	1227000	But I think that people should just not say she had no part in the blame.
1227000	1229000	I hate the word blame.
1229000	1234000	I just think that people should understand she did choose to participate.
1234000	1237000	I don't think this should have happened to her.
1237000	1239000	I don't think any of that should have happened.
1239000	1242000	But just let her be accountable.
1242000	1246000	Let her be posthumously accountable and not the big bad victim,
1246000	1248000	because we're a country of victims and it's sickening.
1248000	1249000	All right.
1249000	1252000	Well, I'm going to try and keep the show moving,
1252000	1254000	but I do want to say this, just kind of a friendly reminder that,
1254000	1256000	you know, Orange Andrea, part of the reason why we're here
1256000	1259000	is to let gamers all have their voice,
1259000	1261000	whether you may agree with it or not.
1261000	1263000	And sometimes it's on a very superficial level
1263000	1266000	where it's Nintendo versus Sony versus Microsoft.
1266000	1269000	And, you know, sometimes we call Sony executives' names
1269000	1270000	and you may not agree with that.
1270000	1273000	And sometimes we may be praising Nintendo or Microsoft things
1273000	1276000	that you don't agree with or whatever it may be.
1276000	1278000	In this case it was something that wasn't so superficial,
1278000	1280000	something that really struck a nerve.
1280000	1283000	But keep in mind that part of the reason why the three of us are here
1283000	1286000	and part of what Jamie brings to the show and Loki brings to the show
1286000	1290000	and I bring to the show is that we have pretty blunt opinions
1290000	1292000	and controversial opinions sometimes.
1292000	1294000	And you may not always agree with it,
1294000	1297000	but we do have the right to have that voice, nevertheless.
1297000	1300000	You know, I don't agree with Jamie 100% on this particular thing,
1300000	1302000	but she has the right to say it and I defend her right to say it.
1302000	1305000	So I also want to kind of get that out because, you know,
1305000	1308000	if you're going to email me saying Jamie should be off the show,
1308000	1309000	that's not going to do any good.
1309000	1310000	Did someone do that?
1310000	1311000	You were CC'd on it.
1311000	1312000	Oh, was it that?
1312000	1314000	Yeah, no, no, we'll talk later.
1314000	1316000	But it was, you know, it's kind of one of those things.
1316000	1318000	Yeah, I'm going to be off of the show that I helped make.
1318000	1319000	That's not going to happen.
1319000	1320000	That's stupid.
1320000	1323000	She, you know, even if I disagree with her,
1323000	1327000	I think part of the lure of the show is that I can hear her thoughts,
1327000	1328000	you know, and Jamie.
1328000	1329000	Dude, Firebomb had pointed it out.
1329000	1332000	He said, but she's a woman and she therefore has no opinion.
1332000	1333000	Why is it?
1333000	1336000	And the only complaints I got were from men.
1336000	1340000	Well, to be fair, we probably have just more men than women
1340000	1343000	that listen to this show and that's just the culture we're in.
1343000	1346000	But I noticed, though, in general that any time I could say something
1346000	1349000	and Matt could say the exact same thing,
1349000	1353000	but I'm the one that gets the emails about it that I should go, you know, be quiet.
1353000	1354000	You know what?
1354000	1355000	Hello, universe.
1355000	1356000	I'm a woman.
1356000	1359000	I have an opinion and you're going to fucking shut up and listen to it.
1359000	1361000	So fuck you.
1361000	1363000	That's how I feel.
1363000	1367000	But at the same time, you have the right to express your rebuttal arguments
1367000	1369000	with your intelligent emails and, you know,
1369000	1371000	phone calls we do later in this program.
1371000	1375000	Jamie's not totally shut off to hearing what else you guys might have to say.
1375000	1376000	No, seriously.
1376000	1379000	You present your rebuttal to me in an intelligent way.
1379000	1381000	I'm more than happy to discuss it with you.
1381000	1384000	I think we can agree to disagree, but I would love to hear.
1384000	1385000	I invite anybody.
1385000	1389000	If you've got an opposite opinion to what I have, I love debate.
1389000	1390000	Oh, my God.
1390000	1391000	So prove it.
1391000	1392000	Bring it.
1392000	1393000	All right.
1393000	1394000	I will discuss with you until the cows come home.
1394000	1398000	Let's see what we can debate about this week by moving into some gaming news
1398000	1403000	and we're going to start it off tonight with Loki's got some more exclusives for us.
1403000	1406000	You just keep getting the good shit, don't you, Loki?
1406000	1407000	I keep trying.
1407000	1410000	Oh, for the record also, Luminous Plus is listed on GameStop's site
1410000	1413000	as coming out on the 27th of February.
1413000	1414000	Something's up.
1414000	1416000	God, I should go back and grab it.
1416000	1417000	Where did I see it?
1417000	1418000	Oh, I know where it was now.
1418000	1419000	Maybe I'll go grab it.
1419000	1423000	Anyways, so, yeah, we had a bunch of stories
1423000	1425000	and not just, you know, release dates and stuff.
1425000	1429000	For example, we had a follow-up to, you know, a game we talked about.
1429000	1435000	We announced originally on episode 206, High School Musical the Game,
1435000	1438000	which, you know, to me, I mean, I wasn't too interested about this.
1438000	1441000	It is coming out for the Wii and PlayStation 2.
1441000	1447000	It's based on the Disney Channel like musical that they apparently selling very well on DVD and stuff.
1447000	1451000	But what's actually kind of made it more interesting for me
1451000	1453000	and as we put on the website earlier this week,
1453000	1458000	High School Musical the Game is actually going to be featuring a microphone peripheral for the Wii.
1458000	1460000	Which is kind of neat.
1460000	1462000	So apparently you're going to be singing karaoke.
1462000	1467000	I'm not sure if it's going to be an actual, you know, its own unit,
1467000	1468000	like its own controller,
1468000	1471000	or if it's going to be something that plugs into the bottom of the Wii mote.
1471000	1475000	But either way, you're going to be singing karaoke with this thing.
1475000	1482000	It is going to be coming out now in August, $69.99 for the bundle.
1482000	1484000	And that's kind of interesting to see, you know,
1484000	1488000	some actual companies making some attachments for the Wii
1488000	1492000	other than say, you know, some stupid steering wheel like the Ubisoft games.
1492000	1494000	But that's kind of neat.
1494000	1497000	Other stuff we announced this week,
1497000	1500000	including there's going to be a brand new PSP game coming out
1500000	1503000	based on the Girls Gone Wild franchise.
1503000	1506000	And it's actually a pool themed game.
1506000	1509000	Originally it was going to be called Pocket Pool by itself.
1509000	1512000	And then they picked up the Girls Gone Wild license.
1512000	1514000	Now, Eidos is producing it,
1514000	1516000	and basically it's going to be your standard billiards game,
1516000	1518000	but you unlock nudie pictures.
1518000	1521000	So, you know, who doesn't like some good nudie pictures?
1521000	1522000	Which is hilarious.
1522000	1524000	I think that's a great name for the game, by the way.
1524000	1525000	That's hilarious.
1525000	1529000	And then finally, we've got some, well actually some other stuff.
1529000	1533000	Ubisoft, they announced Brothers in Arms War Stories for the DS.
1533000	1536000	Now, I've been reading some other sites out there saying that,
1536000	1538000	you know, they've heard the same thing,
1538000	1540000	but they're getting their info from the ESRB website
1540000	1541000	because it was listed on there.
1541000	1544000	But either way, it is coming for the DS.
1544000	1548000	It's going to be coming out on June 13th for $29.99.
1548000	1550000	And it should be some interesting stuff.
1550000	1553000	Also, there is a little bit of elaboration for Driver 76,
1553000	1557000	as I mentioned a few episodes back.
1557000	1560000	It's going to be kind of based on the Driver Parallel Lines series,
1560000	1562000	but it's going to be set two years previous
1562000	1564000	and it's going to feature all new missions and stuff like that.
1564000	1566000	So that's going to be kind of cool.
1566000	1571000	And then, of course, Sega's Virtua Fighter V,
1571000	1573000	and this is also, you know,
1573000	1575000	the street date's been listed on other sites,
1575000	1578000	but according to Sega themselves,
1578000	1582000	they signed a six-month exclusive contract with Sony
1582000	1586000	for the PlayStation exclusivity of it.
1586000	1587000	Where did you hear this?
1587000	1590000	Because I haven't heard this anywhere else about this six-month deal.
1590000	1592000	I heard this actually from Sega
1592000	1595000	because they came into our Dallas office
1595000	1598000	to do kind of their lineup of stuff,
1598000	1601000	and I was questioning them about dates and stuff.
1601000	1603000	At least I was emailing our buyer about dates,
1603000	1607000	and she said that they're on a six-month exclusive deal.
1607000	1612000	So I know GameStop had a tentative date on their website as,
1612000	1614000	what was it, August something.
1614000	1616000	It was towards the end of August,
1616000	1620000	but it would be six months from when it's actually released
1620000	1622000	in February for the PlayStation 3.
1622000	1626000	So that's kind of interesting.
1626000	1631000	And that was the exclusive news we had.
1631000	1632000	Oh, I'm sorry.
1632000	1634000	And then, of course, my favorite one here,
1634000	1638000	the two Konami Wii titles that are going to be coming out in March.
1638000	1645000	And now it's Wing Island and Kororinpa Marble Mania
1645000	1647000	is going to be coming out as well for the Wii.
1647000	1649000	Both are going to be pretty reasonably priced,
1649000	1651000	only $39.99 for each.
1651000	1655000	Both coming out on the 28th of March.
1655000	1659000	So I'm sure we'll have more info about that next week
1659000	1661000	after Konami's Gamers' Day.
1661000	1664000	But that was some interesting stuff.
1664000	1667000	Wait, was that Koro as in, like, C-H-O-R-O?
1667000	1669000	K-O-R-O.
1669000	1672000	I want another Koro game.
1672000	1675000	Anyways, there was some other stuff,
1675000	1679000	other announcements regarding dates as well.
1679000	1681000	This one, Rob, you're going to like.
1681000	1684000	Elevator Action for the Wii is coming out on June 13th.
1684000	1686000	That's a pretty rad arcade game.
1686000	1688000	I'd be curious to see what they do with it.
1688000	1689000	Yeah.
1689000	1692000	And, of course, Blade Storm's been delayed on the PlayStation 3
1692000	1695000	to June 15th as well.
1695000	1701000	Call of Juarez for the Xbox 360 is coming out on June 15th.
1701000	1705000	And Turok for the PlayStation 3 and 360
1705000	1710000	also going to be coming out in September on the 12th.
1710000	1712000	So lots of good stuff.
1712000	1714000	And I'll, of course, be posting more dates
1714000	1718000	to our Under the Radar thread that we have on the forums.
1718000	1720000	So keep an eye on that.
1720000	1722000	I will.
1722000	1723000	All right.
1723000	1724000	Well, speaking of the Wii,
1724000	1726000	I guess we're getting elevator action pretty soon.
1726000	1728000	And now we're getting rumors about new channels
1728000	1729000	that could be coming to the Wii.
1729000	1732000	I mean, when the Wii went out and they first announced the Wii,
1732000	1734000	we all knew we were going to be getting, you know,
1734000	1737000	the news channel, the internet channel at some point.
1737000	1740000	Well, now there are rumors of a game channel,
1740000	1744000	and this was spurred by remarks that were made by John Lee,
1744000	1747000	who is the Hudson Entertainment Director of Marketing.
1747000	1750000	He didn't say anything too specific about it,
1750000	1753000	but when he was asked about downloadable games for the Wii,
1753000	1754000	this was his quote.
1754000	1756000	Quote, however, in the future,
1756000	1758000	you should rephrase that question to,
1758000	1761000	are there any plans to launch original content
1761000	1763000	on some downloadable service on the Wii?
1763000	1765000	And you might get a different answer.
1765000	1767000	Now Nintendo, of course, said, you know,
1767000	1770000	Wii cannot confirm what format the new content will be delivered.
1770000	1772000	There will be original games at the Wii shop eventually.
1772000	1774000	But it could be interesting,
1774000	1775000	because this is launching speculation
1775000	1777000	that it might be just a whole new channel
1777000	1780000	to separate classic Nintendo titles
1780000	1782000	and these, you know, downloadable titles
1782000	1784000	in a new channel by itself.
1784000	1787000	Why couldn't he just not be a jackass about the whole thing?
1787000	1788000	You mean...
1788000	1789000	What do you mean?
1789000	1790000	I'm sorry.
1790000	1791000	I can't answer your question
1791000	1793000	and ask me the correct question.
1793000	1794000	Riddle me this.
1794000	1796000	I think, you know, there are NDAs and things,
1796000	1798000	so I think he's trying to think of a clever way around it.
1798000	1800000	I don't think he's a jackass.
1800000	1802000	But that, I mean, they're just like, it's like,
1802000	1805000	you know, if you're asking, say, for example,
1805000	1807000	imagine you're asking Sony
1807000	1809000	when the PlayStation 3 is going to be coming out in the UK
1809000	1810000	or something like that.
1810000	1812000	You're like, so, uh,
1812000	1814000	when are you guys going to be releasing the,
1814000	1816000	you know, PlayStation 3 in the UK?
1816000	1819000	I'm sorry you did not ask the correct question.
1819000	1821000	I have a question in the form of a walrus.
1821000	1823000	Perhaps if you asked,
1823000	1825000	when is it coming to England?
1825000	1827000	I might have answered you,
1827000	1829000	but because you did not,
1829000	1831000	you will not be told the answer.
1831000	1833000	I mean, that's just fucking annoying.
1833000	1835000	It's just, you know, answer the damn question.
1835000	1837000	Fireboom asks an interesting question
1837000	1839000	out of left field here a little bit.
1839000	1841000	It says, weren't we supposed to have different colors
1841000	1842000	for Wii consoles by now?
1842000	1844000	I want to say I read a story.
1844000	1845000	It's not in our show world tonight,
1845000	1846000	but I want to say I read a story
1846000	1848000	somewhere on the internet earlier this week
1848000	1850000	that said, yeah, they were going to do different colors,
1850000	1852000	but since they're having trouble keeping the gray ones
1852000	1853000	on shelves as it is,
1853000	1855000	that the new colors are going to be quite some ways off.
1855000	1857000	New colors will be something they do
1857000	1859000	when they want to sell more systems.
1859000	1861000	They're not going to do it right now.
1861000	1863000	They're not having trouble selling the systems yet,
1863000	1866000	so just wait until the systems start to die off a little bit,
1866000	1868000	start getting, you know, into the same situation
1868000	1870000	as the 360 and PS3 right now,
1870000	1873000	and then they'll throw out the extra colors
1873000	1876000	and do all these shit that you don't need for it.
1876000	1877000	It's very interesting to see how the Wii is,
1877000	1878000	you know, I'm just thinking about this
1878000	1879000	because I read it today.
1879000	1880000	One of my friends on LiveJournal,
1880000	1882000	my old roommate, who wasn't much of a gamer,
1882000	1884000	remember the very first OLR studio,
1884000	1885000	my roommate there?
1885000	1888000	Okay, he wasn't that super into games.
1888000	1890000	He always kind of thought the show he did was kind of weird,
1890000	1891000	but he thought it was cool, right?
1891000	1893000	Well, he made this post in LiveJournal today
1893000	1894000	about how he wants a Wii
1894000	1895000	because he played one over the weekend.
1895000	1896000	He thought it was awesome,
1896000	1898000	and he says, I don't really get into video games,
1898000	1899000	but the Wii was fun.
1899000	1901000	It was very interesting to read things like that.
1901000	1903000	It's so interesting to read from the not,
1903000	1906000	you know, to take some time away from the game blog
1906000	1908000	because once in a while to read what other people have to say.
1908000	1909000	It's just very interesting.
1909000	1912000	I think Nintendo's very, very happy at reaction like that.
1912000	1914000	That was their goal, was it not?
1914000	1915000	I suppose it was.
1915000	1918000	Well, you know, we have actually a little bit more
1918000	1921000	coming from Nintendo, specifically about the channels.
1921000	1927000	The news channel, there's a pretty good review of it, I found.
1927000	1929000	Have you...
1929000	1931000	I've played with the news channel.
1931000	1932000	I played with that a little bit this week.
1932000	1933000	It was fun.
1933000	1934000	Well, basically, the news channel,
1934000	1936000	and this is a couple things that I like about it.
1936000	1939000	It seems like it's got pretty easy browsing to it.
1939000	1941000	Brings up your local news based on your area.
1941000	1942000	You can click on globe, though,
1942000	1946000	and it shows you where you are in relation to the rest of the world.
1946000	1949000	It's pretty cool.
1949000	1951000	You can also, there's a slide show.
1951000	1954000	There's, you know, you can see the headlines come through
1954000	1959000	at the bottom half, and you pick wherever.
1959000	1961000	You bring up any of the stories that come up on the slide show
1961000	1968000	by pressing A. It's pretty easy to follow, I think.
1968000	1971000	It's looking like they said that the relaunch of it
1971000	1973000	is going to be later this year,
1973000	1978000	and it's going to be free and offer more regions available for viewing.
1978000	1982000	But so far, it seems so, you know, so far so good, pretty much.
1982000	1983000	I actually like it quite a bit.
1983000	1985000	I like it more than I like the forecast channel.
1985000	1988000	But my only suggestion for the news channel would be that,
1988000	1992000	you know how the forecast channel has the temperature and things
1992000	1994000	in the Wii browser?
1994000	1996000	Like, you don't have to launch the forecast channel
1996000	1997000	just to see the temperature,
1997000	2000000	although it's horribly out of date, at least for this region.
2000000	2003000	Like, it never updates after midnight or 6 a.m.
2003000	2004000	Like, it never updates for the rest of the day.
2004000	2006000	But I kind of wish, like, you could,
2006000	2008000	like, if I'm just quickly clicking through channels
2008000	2010000	to get to a virtual console game or something,
2010000	2011000	it would be cool to see, like,
2011000	2014000	what some of the top headlines are in the news channel at the moment.
2014000	2015000	Because that might make me go,
2015000	2016000	oh, I want to click there and read it.
2016000	2017000	Because if you think about it,
2017000	2018000	that's kind of how your email is set up, right?
2018000	2020000	If you use Yahoo mail or you use Hotmail
2020000	2022000	or one of those web clients for your email,
2022000	2026000	hell, even Gmail, you have links to news articles usually
2026000	2028000	or RSS feeds that run kind of along the side of your email.
2028000	2030000	And sometimes that's what makes me stop and go,
2030000	2031000	oh, that sounds interesting.
2031000	2033000	That's actually why I stopped using most of those
2033000	2037000	because my email is through my friend Julie's server
2037000	2038000	and I don't have to worry about any of that.
2038000	2040000	But I don't mind it on, like, you know,
2040000	2045000	because I use Firefox ad block and stuff.
2045000	2047000	But, yeah, when you use Yahoo mail,
2047000	2049000	it shows you some of the top headlines, which is kind of cool.
2049000	2051000	I stopped using Yahoo mail just because of that.
2051000	2054000	I like to have my news where I can, you know,
2054000	2057000	if I'm going for news, I'm going specifically for news.
2057000	2060000	That's why the first thing that I have pull up is my Yahoo page
2060000	2062000	and I have my world events and all that listing.
2062000	2064000	I would really, though, this is my hope.
2064000	2067000	I'm not quite sure what their news source is,
2067000	2069000	but I hope that they don't go with...
2069000	2070000	Associated Press.
2070000	2071000	They have a two-year agreement with Associated Press.
2071000	2072000	Okay.
2072000	2076000	Well, I still, I'm very leery about most of our press publications
2076000	2083000	just because there's a lot of bias, a lot of sensationalism in modern press.
2083000	2085000	Well, you know what I thought was hilarious is, you know,
2085000	2088000	of course one of the first places I went to look for stories locally
2088000	2090000	once I got to the Globe was Sacramento.
2090000	2092000	And guess what the top news story was in the Sacramento region
2092000	2095000	on the news channel was about the, you know,
2095000	2098000	again, here's more news and to hold your Wii for a Wii thing
2098000	2099000	as if we could have more.
2099000	2101000	I was reading BBC news and saw crap on it.
2101000	2102000	Yeah, I know. It's everywhere.
2102000	2105000	I usually go from my world news to a BBC world.
2105000	2106000	So, of course that's on it,
2106000	2109000	but I thought it would be interesting that you're reading that on the Wii,
2109000	2111000	you know, but what was even more interesting
2111000	2113000	is that when you looked in the technology and entertainment section,
2113000	2115000	there was a story the first day it launched
2115000	2118000	about the PlayStation 3 launch being announced in Europe,
2118000	2121000	which I thought was very interesting.
2121000	2124000	So, it was interesting that that was on the news channel.
2124000	2125000	Yeah.
2125000	2127000	So, and you could even see a picture of a PlayStation 3
2127000	2129000	and it was just, it was kind of one of those moments.
2129000	2131000	The very first time you see the Nintendo and Sega logos
2131000	2133000	on the screen together, like when you boot up F-Zero,
2133000	2134000	it was one of those moments,
2134000	2136000	like looking at a picture of a PlayStation 3 on your Wii.
2136000	2137000	It was weird.
2137000	2138000	It was very awkward.
2138000	2140000	I like you with your Elibits icon on Xbox Live.
2140000	2141000	That's true.
2141000	2143000	My friends list icon on Xbox Live is an Elibit,
2143000	2145000	so I guess that's not the first time.
2145000	2148000	And, you know, at one time my background was a picture of Mario Kart
2148000	2150000	because that was when I was playing around
2150000	2152000	with using backgrounds from the computer.
2152000	2155000	So, just fun to do little things like that, I suppose.
2155000	2157000	I like irony.
2157000	2160000	Anyways, speaking about the Wii,
2160000	2163000	there's going to be some fun stuff coming to the Virtual Console soon.
2163000	2166000	And one of the biggest games coming, you know, to the Virtual Console
2166000	2169000	and only to, you know, Trump, you know, was it last week's,
2169000	2172000	you know, Link to the Past.
2172000	2176000	Legend of Zelda the Ocarina of Time is going to be heading
2176000	2179000	to at least the Japanese Virtual Console in February.
2179000	2182000	It's going to be slated for 1200 points
2182000	2186000	and of course it's going to make it to the United States
2186000	2189000	shortly after the Japanese one, if not the same day.
2189000	2192000	But, that's awesome.
2192000	2194000	Not interested.
2194000	2196000	Okay, well that's awesome for other people.
2196000	2199000	I'm not interested either because I had it on GameCube for the longest time.
2199000	2202000	Exactly. And the Wii can play GameCube games.
2202000	2204000	So, what's the point?
2204000	2206000	Like, you know, I understand.
2206000	2207000	Sometimes people go like,
2207000	2210000	well Rob, then why do you bother downloading anything on there at all
2210000	2212000	when you can just use emulators?
2212000	2215000	Okay, because I can't use emulators on my TV with a wireless remote.
2215000	2217000	I'm just too lazy to set that thing up
2217000	2219000	and I like the authentic experience.
2219000	2222000	But using that little GameCube disc with the Zelda game on it
2222000	2224000	is a pretty authentic experience.
2224000	2225000	Yeah.
2225000	2228000	So, I don't get the point of downloading it.
2228000	2230000	I'm going to be downloading Mario Kart.
2230000	2232000	But here's the best part though.
2232000	2235000	You know, when this game does come out, you know,
2235000	2238000	it's going to be great and people are going to download it and stuff.
2238000	2240000	Then later on down the line, remember how, you know,
2240000	2244000	they were talking about, oh yeah, well we can do a line of games,
2244000	2246000	you know, and thank the Game Boy Advance here, you know,
2246000	2249000	when they released the old Nintendo games for it again.
2249000	2253000	We can do a line of games that are just GameCube and maybe Nintendo 64 games
2253000	2256000	ported over with the controls for the Wii.
2256000	2259000	So, you would have like, you know, Mario Kart Double Dash or whatever
2259000	2264000	ported over like in being sold for say $29.99 or something like that
2264000	2267000	with just, you know, no changes whatsoever
2267000	2270000	other than the controls for the Wii.
2270000	2274000	Watch this kind of happen or they release some sort of, you know,
2274000	2280000	collector's edition of all the Zelda games or something again.
2280000	2282000	I'm reading what the chat room has to say on this.
2282000	2284000	Jeremy Todd 1 says, I have played and beat Ocarina of Time
2284000	2286000	a few too many times now.
2286000	2288000	I beat it on 64, I beat it on the GameCube,
2288000	2290000	I beat it on the computer, whistles,
2290000	2294000	and like OLR said, I have the GameCube game so I can just play that.
2294000	2296000	GS68 would like to point out, you know,
2296000	2298000	playing the Ocarina is kind of hell with the C-Stick,
2298000	2301000	which does make sense because you didn't have the buttons on the GameCube,
2301000	2303000	you had that stick.
2303000	2304000	Well, it doesn't stop there.
2304000	2307000	There's lots of titles coming to Japan, not just Ocarina of Time,
2307000	2309000	but lots of cool stuff coming out in Japan.
2309000	2312000	Now, keep in mind not all of these have American counterparts,
2312000	2315000	but some of them do and so you'll probably be seeing those before too long.
2315000	2318000	Mighty Bomb Jack from the NES is coming out there soon.
2318000	2321000	Galaga, again, these are Japan dates, coming out on the NES.
2321000	2324000	Kirby's Adventure coming out on the NES.
2324000	2330000	Kamaitachi no Yoru is coming out for the Super Nintendo.
2330000	2333000	Megami Tensei, Super Goals and Ghosts,
2333000	2335000	Sangokushi 4,
2335000	2339000	Bare Knuckles, Streets of Rage for Genesis,
2339000	2341000	Beyond Oasis, also on the Genesis,
2341000	2343000	Vector Man for the Genesis,
2343000	2345000	Sword of Vermillion on the Genesis,
2345000	2347000	Vigilante on TurboGrafx-16,
2347000	2349000	Chu Man Fu,
2349000	2351000	Yokai Doshuki,
2351000	2354000	Wonder Momo also all coming out on TurboGrafx-16.
2354000	2358000	So, sounds like there's a lot of cool stuff coming out on your Japanese Virtual Console
2358000	2361000	and many of those titles that do have American versions
2361000	2363000	we'll probably be seeing those before too long.
2363000	2365000	Bare Knuckle, that brings back memories
2365000	2367000	because we picked up the Japanese cart
2367000	2369000	and used a converter on it to play on our Nomad
2369000	2371000	and it played it as Streets of Rage.
2371000	2373000	It was a Bare Knuckle cart.
2373000	2375000	That's weird, how did it know that?
2375000	2377000	Sometimes they'll do that.
2377000	2383000	Actually, a lot of the Neo Geo games will have a Switch.
2383000	2385000	You can play them in either version.
2385000	2390000	Our Japanese Samurai Spirits 2 is Samurai Shodown 2
2390000	2392000	and it'll play depending on what mode we have it in.
2392000	2394000	You know what I'd like to see Nintendo do
2394000	2396000	and this is going to seem completely out of left field,
2396000	2398000	but I would like to see them release some Japanese games
2398000	2400000	that never got released here.
2400000	2402000	You know, and just...
2402000	2404000	I mean, I guess...
2404000	2407000	Well, okay, that's a little obscure,
2407000	2410000	but I'm thinking Earthbound on the NES,
2410000	2412000	Mother Zero or whatever it's...
2412000	2415000	The original Mother, which we call Earthbound Zero
2415000	2416000	on that translated ROM...
2416000	2417000	No, it wasn't a translated ROM,
2417000	2419000	it was a ROM that somebody bought on eBay,
2419000	2420000	which is a prototype.
2420000	2423000	So it's like that game is floating around there, half done.
2423000	2426000	Wouldn't that be awesome if that came out on the Virtual Console?
2426000	2427000	I agree.
2427000	2428000	I don't know.
2428000	2429000	Maybe that's just too much work,
2429000	2432000	but I can't believe that Nintendo isn't making an arm and a leg
2432000	2433000	off a lot of these Virtual Console games.
2433000	2436000	We need the freakin' TurboGrafx Twinbee.
2436000	2437000	Oh, we'll see.
2437000	2438000	And Parodius.
2438000	2439000	We need Parodius.
2439000	2440000	We'll see.
2440000	2441000	Anyway.
2441000	2443000	Well, something that will make a lot of people happy,
2443000	2444000	speaking of Virtual Console,
2444000	2450000	is Mario Kart 64 is going to be on Virtual Console in Europe.
2450000	2453000	It's actually the second Nintendo 64 title
2453000	2459000	to be on the European Virtual Console.
2459000	2464000	It's a really... It's Mario Kart.
2464000	2466000	There's really not much else to be said about it,
2466000	2469000	but there's also a notice that Soldier Blade,
2469000	2471000	which is a TurboGrafx-16 game,
2471000	2475000	is also going to be available for 600 points.
2475000	2478000	Well, everybody's getting in on the Mario Kart love now.
2478000	2481000	It's nice to see another Nintendo 64 title get up there, though.
2481000	2484000	And I'll tell you, Mario Kart on the 64
2484000	2487000	was the best version next to the original, I'd say.
2487000	2488000	You know what we need is Pokemon Snail.
2488000	2489000	Toad's Highway.
2489000	2490000	End of story.
2490000	2491000	Pokemon Snap.
2491000	2492000	I would agree.
2492000	2495000	Pokemon Snap would be pretty awesome.
2495000	2497000	How about Superman 64?
2497000	2498000	Oh, fuck no.
2498000	2500000	That was so funny.
2500000	2501000	That'd be kind of cool, though.
2501000	2503000	Blast Corpse or something like that.
2503000	2504000	Or even, you know...
2504000	2505000	Pokemon Puzzle League.
2505000	2507000	Actually, GoldenEye 64.
2507000	2508000	You know what you'd probably like?
2508000	2509000	Dream On.
2509000	2510000	It's a rare game.
2510000	2511000	I know.
2511000	2515000	Once they start doing the light gun games and stuff,
2515000	2516000	they should do...
2516000	2517000	Super Scope.
2517000	2519000	Well, Super Scope would be awesome,
2519000	2521000	but the Pokemon Snap or something like that.
2521000	2523000	How awesome was the Super Scope?
2523000	2525000	It was a bazooka, for God's sake.
2525000	2526000	It was awesome.
2526000	2527000	I know.
2527000	2528000	It was hard.
2528000	2529000	I remember sitting playing,
2529000	2531000	because I had a Super Scope when they came out,
2531000	2534000	sitting there playing freaking Blastress
2534000	2538000	for long enough to wear out the battery in the Super Scope.
2538000	2540000	That was six hours.
2540000	2542000	Oh, I have some folks agreeing with me in chat room.
2542000	2545000	Alex says, Pokemon Puzzle League FTW.
2545000	2548000	Rama says, I like Pokemon Puzzle League.
2548000	2549000	I know what's up.
2549000	2551000	I want a Super Scope just to put on my desk.
2551000	2552000	That would be cool.
2552000	2553000	I have one.
2553000	2555000	You'll probably get one at the auction.
2555000	2556000	I have one.
2556000	2557000	Do you want it?
2557000	2558000	Sure.
2558000	2559000	I'll take a Super Scope.
2559000	2560000	I'll see if we can find it.
2560000	2562000	We actually have a Menacer somewhere, too.
2562000	2563000	Put it on my desk.
2563000	2568000	The attachment that hooks onto the Master System gun.
2568000	2571000	JVmon's leading a chant in the chat room for Yoshi Safari
2571000	2572000	with the Wii remote.
2572000	2573000	That might be kind of fun.
2573000	2575000	We need more Metal Slug.
2575000	2576000	What are you talking about?
2576000	2578000	There's the fucking anthologies out on Wii.
2578000	2579000	I know.
2579000	2580000	I have it.
2580000	2581000	But we need more Metal Slug, anyway.
2581000	2582000	No, we don't.
2582000	2583000	Yes, we do.
2583000	2585000	I like how we did that in unison.
2585000	2586000	Great minds think like me.
2586000	2588000	OK, no, WrestleMania 2000 should definitely
2588000	2591000	be on Virtual Console.
2591000	2598000	Anyways, so speaking of the Wii, there's
2598000	2602000	one website that's actually creating sculptures of Miis,
2602000	2603000	which is kind of cool.
2603000	2604000	AllisonQMcCarthy.com.
2612000	2615000	Allison, anyway, she's creating some custom Wii sculptures
2615000	2616000	based on your Miis.
2616000	2618000	Right now, the demand's really big,
2618000	2621000	so she has an email list that you can sign up on.
2621000	2624000	But the first few ones, she's actually
2624000	2625000	going to be doing some generic ones.
2625000	2628000	She'll be posting them on eBay, see how they sell and stuff.
2628000	2630000	But possibly later on, you're going
2630000	2633000	to be able to get, I guess, your own custom Miis, which
2633000	2636000	would be awesome, because I want to.
2636000	2638000	They should totally have a service like that.
2638000	2639000	I mean, think about it.
2639000	2640000	They're doing the same thing for Spore,
2640000	2642000	where you can create your own custom stuff.
2642000	2643000	That made me think of the other thing,
2643000	2645000	like you can put your monsters for Spore.
2645000	2647000	Dude, I'm looking at this.
2647000	2649000	I can do these.
2649000	2650000	Well, then do it.
2650000	2651000	Make me one.
2651000	2652000	I still have to do.
2652000	2654000	I have two more dolphins to face up on.
2654000	2655000	You're a woman.
2655000	2656000	You can make things, right?
2656000	2658000	Hey, Rob, bite my ass.
2658000	2659000	But anyways.
2659000	2661000	Are they like little bobbleheads?
2661000	2662000	Sort of.
2662000	2664000	They sort of look like a bobblehead.
2664000	2667000	They look like they're made from stuff at Michael's.
2667000	2668000	I think it looks cute.
2668000	2670000	They are cute, but it's just a cool thing.
2670000	2672000	Make me one.
2672000	2675000	Yeah, the stuff that's on these, you can buy the bits at Michael's.
2675000	2677000	Why don't you put up or shut up, Jamie?
2677000	2678000	No, seriously.
2678000	2680000	I'll do one once I have time between classes.
2680000	2681000	Awesome.
2681000	2682000	I got free stuff.
2682000	2687000	So definitely keep an eye on AllisonQMcCarthy.com.
2687000	2690000	Yeah, maybe square yourself your own Mii.
2690000	2693000	How much do they charge you for the Miis?
2693000	2698000	Not saying yet because I think she's just starting off with this and got picked up by
2698000	2702000	everywhere, and now they're getting inundated with requests.
2702000	2703000	Poor thing.
2703000	2706000	One of the downsides to getting digged.
2706000	2707000	Was that on dig?
2707000	2708000	I'm pretty sure it was.
2708000	2709000	I think it probably was.
2709000	2710000	All right.
2710000	2714000	Well, Nintendo's really digging the recent sales of the Wii.
2714000	2717000	I mean, the Wii has just been selling like crazy.
2717000	2722000	3.2 million Wiis sold is what Nintendo announced earlier this week.
2722000	2723000	That's pretty crazy.
2723000	2724000	There's not a lot else.
2724000	2726000	I mean, what else can you say about that?
2726000	2727000	They sold 3.2 million Wiis.
2727000	2728000	That's a lot.
2728000	2729000	And certainly interesting.
2729000	2731000	Now, I don't mean to sound anti-Sony.
2731000	2735000	That's not what I'm trying to do here, but it is interesting when you see a thing like
2735000	2739000	this, and you're putting that next to a story where Sony's like, well, we shipped a million
2739000	2742000	in Japan.
2742000	2745000	So, it kind of sucks for them.
2745000	2751800	Well, just more, I think another, though, notch in Nintendo's belt, though, is that
2751800	2759000	they actually did hit now 10 million consumers in America for the Nintendo DS.
2759000	2768920	Since the November 2004 launch, that means that nine Nintendo DS or DS lights have sold
2768920	2772200	every 60 seconds.
2772200	2773200	Wow.
2773200	2775720	Yeah, pretty crazy.
2775720	2780120	I wonder if Sony's going to start pissing their pants.
2780120	2781120	I don't know.
2781120	2783640	No, they'll have some creative little press release for this.
2783640	2786120	It'll be all the drugs that Kudaragi's taking.
2786120	2791600	Black Boy in chat sums it up, says, God, Nintendo is making money hand over fist.
2791600	2796520	Nintendo is selling in a month and a half with 360 sales in a quarter.
2796520	2797520	Interesting.
2797520	2800800	So, we have something, a comment on a story we did a little bit ago.
2800800	2805360	Cutie Honey is in chat and says, the only Metal Slug America is missing is Metal Slug
2805360	2809600	3D, which isn't terribly good, and I think that's to go along with your comment on we
2809600	2813440	need more Metal Slug, and now I said, no, we don't.
2813440	2816120	Metal Slug has to stay two-dimensional.
2816120	2819760	That's just the awesomeness of it.
2819760	2821480	I give Metal Slug a lot of crap.
2821480	2822480	It is kind of fun.
2822480	2826480	I just give Jamie crap for it because she never shuts up about it, but 3D, no, no, no.
2826480	2829880	I haven't played it, but I'm not interested.
2829880	2834560	If you want to play Metal Slug going the other direction, just play Shock Troopers.
2834560	2835560	Okay.
2835560	2842600	Anyways, off the topic of Metal Slug, but still an awesome game, Scarface is coming
2842600	2848440	out for the Wii, and that's awesome because apparently, I was reading on some of the features
2848440	2852200	of this, you're going to be able to wheel the chainsaw and use the Wiimote to chop off
2852200	2853200	limbs.
2853200	2855000	Thank God, this is what we needed.
2855000	2856720	This is awesome.
2856720	2857720	What are you talking about?
2857720	2858720	No, I'm serious.
2858720	2861280	This really is what we needed.
2861280	2863080	Like, you know, come on.
2863080	2868680	Ever since we heard the Wii is like GameCube with a Nitro Boost in it, it's like, where's
2868680	2871400	my fucking Resident Evil 4 with my chainsaw?
2871400	2872400	Come on.
2872400	2875000	I mean, it's just, I don't know.
2875000	2879800	Words cannot describe how happy I am, and to be honest, I mean, I was kind of interested
2879800	2882040	in the Godfather game coming out in March, but...
2882040	2885480	Do you get to whack people with the Wiimote?
2885480	2889000	You do get to manhandle people, though, with the Wiimote, so that's kind of...
2889000	2890720	Can you say that again?
2890720	2892520	Manhandle people with the Wiimote.
2892520	2893520	Okay.
2893520	2895520	God, you're so immature.
2895520	2898120	No, but yeah, it should be pretty awesome.
2898120	2903880	You know, of course, God knows when it's coming out, though, not anytime soon, I'd imagine,
2903880	2909320	but I can't wait to hear more about this.
2909320	2910960	That sounds pretty fun.
2910960	2917120	Well, while we wait for Scarface to come out on the Wii, we could go to a completely different
2917120	2919200	genre yet on another Nintendo system.
2919200	2921320	Remember the Game Boy Advance?
2921320	2922480	Remember it's still alive and kicking?
2922480	2923480	I have one of those.
2923480	2924480	I found mine.
2924480	2928920	It's getting a breath of life in it with the Final Fantasy VI Advance release coming out.
2928920	2931280	Now, of course, you've heard about this is getting a new localization.
2931280	2936520	Well, what's interesting about the localization is that when they originally made the Final
2936520	2942440	Fantasy III, they did some family-friendly kind of edits.
2942440	2945080	They changed death to doom.
2945080	2947560	They changed pubs to cafes.
2947560	2954120	They changed holy to pearl, whatever, I guess you can't say the word holy, and some naughty
2954120	2957400	bits were covered up, pixelated over.
2957400	2960160	What's interesting is that there's a screenshot now floating around the internet from Final
2960160	2964420	Fantasy VI Advance that shows a monster that was originally called Doomgaze in the Super
2964420	2969880	Nintendo release, now given its proper name of Deathgaze, which sounds so much more hardcore.
2969880	2970880	Oh my God.
2970880	2973600	Are they actually going to give Tina the right name?
2973600	2977960	That's interesting because this website that I'm looking at the story on siliconera.com
2977960	2979960	actually poses the same question.
2979960	2981640	Is Tara going to be Tina?
2981640	2982640	Why did they change that?
2982640	2983640	I don't know.
2983640	2984640	I have no idea.
2984640	2987400	Tara's, you know, because Tina's such a bad word.
2987400	2990780	Maybe is it because Tina sounds more American than Tara?
2990780	2991780	I don't know.
2991780	2995160	Yeah, for anyone who doesn't know, Tara's original name in the Japanese Final Fantasy
2995160	2996160	VI was Tina.
2996160	2997160	Oh wait, no.
2997160	2998160	I guess there's no way around.
2998160	2999160	That's all right.
2999160	3002160	I've played the Japanese one.
3002160	3003160	So I'm sorry.
3003160	3004160	Yeah.
3004160	3005160	I guess it was Tara here.
3005160	3008040	Were they going for maybe the double entendre where Tara is kind of like Earth?
3008040	3009040	I don't know.
3009040	3010040	Maybe.
3010040	3011040	I don't know.
3011040	3012040	Seems a little silly.
3012040	3016500	It's just like the whole Aerith thing, isn't it?
3016500	3021520	Aerith makes more sense, but then again, if you translate it by the Kana, it would kind
3021520	3025240	of, Aerith would also make sense for translation purposes.
3025240	3031000	Well, one thing that Jamie probably uses to do her translation is several websites out
3031000	3034800	there on the internet, and certainly she likes to surf the internet up and down and back
3034800	3039320	and forth every week finding her favorites of the internet, and it makes up Dark Sakura's
3039320	3040400	Website of the Week.
3040400	3046200	Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers this week?
3046200	3049240	You should actually be going to PayPal and send me money.
3049240	3050560	Oh wait, no.
3050560	3051560	Really.
3051560	3052560	And it's not a Doctor Who site.
3052560	3053560	Okay.
3053560	3057560	I'll do one next week, geez.
3057560	3060920	A website of the week is massagetherapy.com.
3060920	3067620	I've been spending a lot of time there because I'm in school to be a massage therapist.
3067620	3071920	It's really good though because it has a lot about learning about massage, finding a massage
3071920	3076040	therapist for your own needs and media.
3076040	3083200	One thing that I really think is cool in here is there's a body work glossary in here that
3083200	3089840	lists out a lot of different things you might hear as far as naturopathy, different type
3089840	3094280	of health related things, I think it's really cool.
3094280	3100120	I've learned actually a lot of different modalities just reading through the freaking glossary.
3100120	3104480	So if anyone is into, even if you're not a massage therapist, even if you don't receive
3104480	3107760	a massage, you're trained in natural health, it's really worth looking through and it's
3107760	3111040	been very, very educational to me.
3111040	3117720	SSJ100 Matt says, Jamie, there's no happy ending section.
3117720	3121880	People who give happy endings are not real massage therapists.
3121880	3127400	Now is that massagetherapist.com or massagetherapist.com?
3127400	3129200	Massage therapy.
3129200	3131800	I don't think that's very funny since this is my chosen profession.
3131800	3132800	A joke, Jamie.
3132800	3133800	It's a little joke.
3133800	3136000	I don't think it's a funny joke because it's funny for the rest of my life.
3136000	3137000	I thought it was funny.
3137000	3138000	He thought it was funny.
3138000	3139000	Have a little humor.
3139000	3140000	Are you either of you massage therapists?
3140000	3141000	No.
3141000	3142000	Okay.
3142000	3144000	But if you want me to give you a massage, I'll try.
3144000	3145000	No.
3145000	3146360	You might need a little massage.
3146360	3148320	Your panties seem like they're in a bunch tonight.
3148320	3149320	You know what?
3149320	3150320	I'm going to throw this at you.
3150320	3154520	I think you need an ass massage to get out all those ruffles in your panties because
3154520	3155760	you're quite feathered tonight.
3155760	3157920	I'll take the rapist for five minutes.
3157920	3158920	Yes.
3158920	3159920	Loki got it.
3159920	3160920	It was a Saturday Night Live reference.
3160920	3165240	Anyway, all kidding aside, you may think at first glance that this has nothing to do with
3165240	3166280	gaming, but I say, you know what?
3166280	3170640	If your ass starts to feel numb from so much hardcore gaming or your backs are... Maybe
3170640	3172560	massage therapy is for you.
3172560	3174560	You know what I've noticed?
3174560	3183360	Actually, since I've started doing massage, as in giving massage, my endurance in cardiovascular
3183360	3188200	work, aerobics, has greatly improved.
3188200	3192320	Receiving a massage is just as healthy as receiving one if you do it the right way.
3192320	3193840	It's good for everybody.
3193840	3195600	All right.
3195600	3204120	Anyways, speaking of unhappy endings, apparently there's actually going to be a price increase
3204120	3208400	sort of in the Canadian PlayStation 3s.
3208400	3213200	Wait, a price increase for the PlayStation 3?
3213200	3215920	Somebody screwed up somewhere big time.
3215920	3223560	Someone apparently listened to our contest that we had with the PlayStation 3.
3223560	3224560	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3224560	3225560	Make your own slogan.
3225560	3233080	Anyways, yeah, so there is going to be a slight price increase coming for the PlayStation
3233080	3234080	3.
3234080	3238400	In Canada, the unit's going to cost about $50 more, and I don't think it's in Canadian
3238400	3239400	dollars.
3239400	3241000	It says for a total of $699.99.
3241000	3249200	It says both Best Buy and Future Shop have the console listed at the new price.
3249200	3253120	The old list price used to be $659.99.
3253120	3257000	Hasn't the console already been out there for some time?
3257000	3262360	I guess that they're increasing price, but here's my thing, though.
3262360	3267840	I don't know if they're having the same situation as we are here, but if the consoles are rare
3267840	3271280	maybe they're just raising prices because they can probably sell them for that, right?
3271280	3276840	At least they're on a free game, geez, that's silly, because you know Canada sometimes gets
3276840	3281360	bundle packs that we don't get here.
3281360	3286920	But yeah, I guess whatever the case is, they're getting hosed over there.
3286920	3293000	Well, we don't mean to keep picking on Sony, but look guys, they just keep giving us material.
3293000	3294000	What can we say?
3294000	3299480	Major Nelson over from Microsoft's camp was very quick to point out this week that Sony
3299480	3302520	made a big fat boo-boo on one of their sites.
3302520	3307160	There was a PSP site touting video downloads, and one of the video downloads was for Gran
3307160	3311120	Turismo HD concept, was one of the things you could download, try to get people psyched
3311120	3312760	about the PlayStation 3.
3312760	3318800	Well, they had a screenshot on the website from Gran Turismo HD, but oops, it wasn't
3318800	3322040	actually a screenshot of Gran Turismo HD.
3322040	3327160	It was a screenshot of Project Gotham Racing 3 on Xbox 360.
3327160	3330040	Talk about a fuck-up.
3330040	3334360	You know that that's just some tiny little mistake some intern probably made somewhere,
3334360	3339680	but still, where was the QA on that?
3339680	3342160	Something got screwed up big time.
3342160	3347940	In the follow-up with that story I was just talking about, according to a Sony rep, that
3347940	3352480	is the actual case, that it says, although the suggested retail price of the PlayStation
3352480	3356520	3 in Canada has not changed, some Canadian retailers have chosen to increase their retail
3356520	3359600	price as a result of the weaker Canadian dollar.
3359600	3364120	This increases solely at the discretion of the retailer, as Sony Computer Entertainment
3364120	3366360	Canada has not issued a price increase.
3366360	3371000	Thank you for the clarification, that makes more sense, thank you.
3371000	3376400	I like our chatroom comments, GS68 pokes fun at the Ridge Racer phenomenon going, it's
3376400	3381200	Project Gotham, Project Gotham, get it?
3381200	3384840	I know it doesn't have the same thing to it, but I see what he did there, that's pretty
3384840	3385840	good.
3385840	3386840	Hmm.
3386840	3391920	Well, Sony still though, they still have something shoved up their ass I think.
3391920	3394960	Yeah, you remember us talking about that Ghostbusters game?
3394960	3395960	I do.
3395960	3406000	Well, um, Zoofly did confirm that they were preliminary working on one for Xbox 360.
3406000	3415280	Sony Pictures, however, has pretty much told Zoofly to shut up, pretty much, you know,
3415280	3419080	they've removed the content from their website because of Sony.
3419080	3427080	Any of the content on YouTube has been removed, maybe that just was a breach of NDA, you think?
3427080	3431360	Heaven forbid someone put something out there that got people excited for Sony.
3431360	3437320	Or it could be the fact that Sony owns the rights to the Ghostbusters movies.
3437320	3442680	Well, I don't know, whatever.
3442680	3444200	Wasn't the game being created for Sony?
3444200	3449520	No, it was being created by Zoofly, and they have to get everyone's permission, or they
3449520	3452240	hadn't gotten the permission from any of the actors, or...
3452240	3455720	But wasn't it being created by them for a Sony console?
3455720	3458600	No, it was just being created by them because they like Ghostbusters.
3458600	3461840	Oh, I totally misread that story the first time.
3461840	3462840	That's alright.
3462840	3463840	Interesting.
3463840	3464840	Hmm.
3464840	3469360	Well, yeah, okay, then I guess Sony was just protecting their rights.
3469360	3470360	They're all within their rights.
3470360	3471360	Ah, I get it.
3471360	3476080	Well, still, it's never fun to hear about games going away that we were a little bit
3476080	3477080	excited for.
3477080	3478280	In fact, it makes us a little bit angsty.
3478280	3482680	I don't know about you guys, but I get pretty pissed off when games I get excited for get
3482680	3487520	cancelled, and that calls for some FUs of the week, right, boys and girls?
3487520	3488520	Oh, yeah.
3488520	3489520	I guess.
3489520	3508840	The first FU of the week that I have goes towards the wear and tear on my car.
3508840	3513560	I mean, really, it's not anything that I didn't expect.
3513560	3517040	You drive your car on road trips, it's gonna wear out.
3517040	3520280	It just, it was really kind of freaking me out last night.
3520280	3523760	I didn't expect it to start grinding that suddenly.
3523760	3526120	And of course, we shelled out 150 bucks for parts.
3526120	3531840	Thankfully, we have a friend who can replace brakes, and brakes on the Mitsubishi Lancer
3531840	3534640	are very easy to replace.
3534640	3535640	But Rob...
3535640	3536640	I'm not you.
3536640	3537640	I'm thinking about something else.
3537640	3538640	I'm thinking about...
3538640	3539640	It's not related.
3539640	3540640	Unlikely, Tori!
3540640	3544480	Am I not allowed to laugh and have a good time at this show?
3544480	3546480	I'm gonna talk to him about my car.
3546480	3547480	No.
3547480	3548480	You do that.
3548480	3559120	So, yeah, a big, big major Uber FU goes to my car not being immortal, I guess.
3559120	3563960	And another one goes to Rob for parking like an asshole.
3563960	3564960	You know what?
3564960	3567840	Because I had to pick your ass up because your car was in the shop.
3567840	3570960	Had I not had to pick your ass up, I wouldn't have to repark the car.
3570960	3574280	Rob, tell me, how many times have you been in the car with me when I've pulled into a
3574280	3576560	spot and then backed up and adjusted my parking?
3576560	3578900	I don't give a fuck!
3578900	3583440	I had to contort myself to get out of your damn car.
3583440	3586360	And no thank you for the ride or anything like that.
3586360	3588320	You park like an asshole, you jerk.
3588320	3591320	I thanked you for the ride when you picked me up and I gave you a cookie.
3591320	3592320	I gave you cookies!
3592320	3594040	Okay, the cookie was good.
3594040	3596380	My cookies are great.
3596380	3600040	My cookies bring all the Robs to my house.
3600040	3603320	I'm bringing more cookies next week, too.
3603320	3604320	Okay.
3604320	3608440	Fuck, you did a superwoman that was in front of me when I was trying to get out of my apartment
3608440	3615040	complex today because she saw us behind her and she walked slower because she's a jackass.
3615040	3620440	Also another thing, what the hell is the point, I'm looking at decalgirl.com and they have
3620440	3623960	a skin that you can buy for your PlayStation 3 that's black.
3623960	3624960	That's like stupid.
3624960	3628360	Why the hell would I cover my PlayStation 3 with a skin that's the same color as the
3628360	3631380	goddamn PlayStation 3?
3631380	3632380	I don't know why.
3632380	3635480	I don't know because you're an idiot, I guess.
3635480	3637480	So fuck them.
3637480	3642060	I just want to give an F.U. of the week to my Saturday because it kind of sucked because
3642060	3645120	I had a migraine, which sucks, like they really suck.
3645120	3649460	I don't get them very often when I do it really sucks and so I had that and then I got sick
3649460	3654680	off of dinner and you know, not that I had to perform on Saturday night or anything which
3654680	3655800	really pissed me off.
3655800	3662360	So F.U. to mother nature for playing tricks on me on Saturday, it kind of pissed me off.
3662360	3665200	And it ruined my game.
3665200	3667600	The game of life.
3667600	3673060	Speaking of the game of life, at least the game of our lives, ooh, food.
3673060	3680520	Speaking of games, our favorite topic, at least it was in the last few years, Bomani.
3680520	3682120	Bomani's turned 10.
3682120	3686000	All those music game franchises, they're so old.
3686000	3692320	Anyways, so to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Bomani, Konami is holding a pop music culture
3692320	3697920	festival at Tokyo's Laphorette Museum.
3697920	3703040	So that's pretty awesome, you know, and lots of festivities going along with that, artists,
3703040	3707800	you know, performing, DJs, etc.
3707800	3713320	And I'm sure I, like most people, had similar reactions where it's like, 10 years?
3713320	3717120	It's been 10 freaking years, god, I'm old.
3717120	3719400	I know, seriously.
3719400	3721440	I don't know about you guys, but that's my reaction to that.
3721440	3727400	I remember, you know, when I first saw Bomani, you know, I remember it was at Fanime, and
3727400	3734760	we went up to one of the rooms that was there, and they were playing Beatmania on a Playstation,
3734760	3741040	and they were playing, I remember the song too, it was the Melger Solid theme, and I
3741040	3743560	was just like, fucking A, that's awesome.
3743560	3745080	I was like, I gotta buy this.
3745080	3750880	So I did, and I played it, and I stopped playing it, and then next time I saw DDR4th Mix, and
3750880	3753400	I was like, ooh, I gotta get that too.
3753400	3756920	And then next thing you know, I'm going to arcades and I meet these crazy people, and
3756920	3764120	they're doing a radio show, and my life just spiraled downhill from there.
3764120	3766080	What was your first Bomani?
3766080	3770280	The very first time I saw Bomani, I went to Milpitas Golf Land to play golf, and I saw
3770280	3773400	a bunch of people dancing on the machine, it looked like fun because I was playing Buster
3773400	3778360	Groove 2 on the Playstation at the time.
3778360	3782440	So I did not know anything about Japanese imports at the time, so I was playing Buster
3782440	3783440	Groove 2.
3783440	3787520	I'm giving you, part of me is, the other part of my heart's breaking.
3787520	3789920	Well, let it break.
3789920	3790920	You're too sassy tonight.
3790920	3791920	I know.
3791920	3794840	You need to, I'm being real with you tonight.
3794840	3798840	I'm giving that angst right back at you tonight.
3798840	3799840	I like it.
3799840	3800840	I know you do.
3800840	3805280	Let's see, so yeah, that was the first time I ever saw it, but there were so many people
3805280	3806280	there.
3806280	3808760	I think there was a tournament going on or something, but we couldn't play it.
3808760	3813800	So the first time I actually played was at a Rocky Horror Picture Show convention in
3813800	3814800	Las Vegas.
3814800	3820360	I played at Circus Circus with an iguana girl who ended up going on to be some big admin
3820360	3825880	over at that DDR Freak site, but I don't think she really plays much anymore, so that was
3825880	3826880	my first game.
3826880	3832600	I don't play admin much anymore either, but my first was, and you're going to laugh at
3832600	3836640	this, was when I still lived in Alabama playing BM 98.
3836640	3837640	You remember BM 98?
3837640	3838640	Look, he left the room.
3838640	3839640	I'm stealing a french fry.
3839640	3840640	Give me one too.
3840640	3841640	You want one too?
3841640	3842640	Okay.
3842640	3843640	Give me his toast.
3843640	3844640	You want his piece of toast?
3844640	3845640	Here you go.
3845640	3846640	Here's a fry.
3846640	3847640	Shh, don't tell.
3847640	3848640	Okay, yes.
3848640	3849640	BM 98, yeah?
3849640	3850640	Uh huh.
3850640	3856040	BM 98 was awesome because it was a customizable, it was one of, I think it was honestly one
3856040	3863920	of the precursors to many of our simulators today, and you know, so I got to play a lot
3863920	3871480	of the early Beatmania songs probably right around, actually yeah, 1998, and then my first
3871480	3883960	DDR was playing the first Mixhome one when I moved out here from Alabama, and then I
3883960	3887280	played my first actual machine at.
3887280	3888280	Don't glare at me.
3888280	3889280	She took one too.
3889280	3891080	Rob took it for me though.
3891080	3892160	Is that my 7-Up?
3892160	3893160	Is that my 7-Up?
3893160	3894160	Then I get a fry.
3894160	3896160	Oh, I don't care if you're eating my food.
3896160	3898120	Rob, go get me a root beer.
3898120	3900000	Do I look like your bitch?
3900000	3901000	Yes.
3901000	3904160	Rob wants to go get me a root beer.
3904160	3913680	That's awesome, but I honestly think that the simulators like BM 98 got a lot of people
3913680	3921080	in the very early days of Bimani into these games who might not have otherwise had access
3921080	3923360	to them.
3923360	3928340	I remember trying to make a file a long last time ago for BM 98 and I just couldn't do
3928340	3934560	it because I got really bored doing it, and from what I understand actually, it's sort
3934560	3940240	of seeing a resurgence in fan communities, I think that's kind of cool.
3940240	3944680	My favorite though has to be Delight Delight Reduplication.
3944680	3947640	I still have that somewhere.
3947640	3952800	I remember how awesome it was when Dance with Intensity came out and was just like, wow,
3952800	3958560	this is so much better, and then Step Media came out and that was pretty cool too, but
3958560	3960680	who'd have thought.
3960680	3965060	Although slightly related to the family of Bimani games is one of the really horrid games
3965060	3970480	that I think Konami should disavow any knowledge of, and that's Dance Dance Dance.
3970480	3972920	It was shitty.
3972920	3976800	In my professional opinion, as an internet celebrity.
3976800	3980120	Don't you hate it when you think of good ideas, like right when you get back in the chair
3980120	3984200	and somebody in the chat room actually said it, Bandit says, bet he shakes the can.
3984200	3990600	That would have been an awesome idea, especially because Jamie's working on her laptop.
3990600	3991600	She would have cried.
3991600	3996400	No, I would have picked up my destroyed laptop and thrown it at your PC.
3996400	4001600	That would have been a fun show, suddenly we're knocked off air.
4001600	4005060	And then Jeremy Todd One would like to point this out.
4005060	4010160	He sent this to me in a message there in the chat room, and he's sent me a little slip
4010160	4014120	from YouParkLikeAnAsshole.com, although I'd like to point out he didn't even see it, Jeremy
4014120	4015120	Todd One.
4015120	4016120	Oh yeah.
4016120	4020880	He checked off two spots, one car, a little too close, over the painted lines, diagonal
4020880	4025120	parking, cool car, diagonal parking, not so cool car, and then he checked off other for
4025120	4026120	sucking.
4026120	4027120	For sucking.
4027120	4028120	I hate you.
4028120	4029120	You know what?
4029120	4031420	DMN agrees with us, agrees with me and Jeremy Todd One, by the way.
4031420	4036000	For this, Jeremy Todd One gets a kick from the chat room, we'll just do that, control
4036000	4038280	kick, there we go, nice good kick from the chat room.
4038280	4042800	DMN wanted me to punch you in the arm, and he gave me a heart if I did it, so I'm gonna
4042800	4043800	punch Robin.
4043800	4047640	No, I got you a gun, ow!
4047640	4048640	You're a real bitch tonight.
4048640	4049640	I am not, I'm nice.
4049640	4055120	I gave you cookies.
4055120	4056120	It's always the cookies.
4056120	4057120	It always comes back to the cookies.
4057120	4059000	I know, you did it all for the cookie.
4059000	4062400	All right, did everybody have fun reminiscing about the Bemani?
4062400	4064240	Yes, and thank you for my root beer.
4064240	4065240	You're welcome.
4065240	4069120	All right, Harmonics talked this week a little bit about something that's not Bemani related,
4069120	4073360	because you know, Harmonics didn't make Bemani, but certainly they're a huge, huge player
4073360	4077080	in the music video game franchise, and they are talking about the guitar.
4077080	4079800	Technically, they did kind of work on Bemani.
4079800	4084040	Oh, that's true, Karaoke Revolution, I stand corrected, so they have dabbled in Bemani
4084040	4085040	a little bit.
4085040	4089720	Well, and that was definitely two forces coming together, that was pretty cool.
4089720	4092840	Yeah, what a fucking monster that made.
4092840	4098240	Anywho, one of the folks that works over at Harmonics, and that would be Daniel Sussman,
4098240	4102400	who is a producer over at Harmonics, quote, here's the official line, Harmonics can confirm
4102400	4106960	that we are not developing Guitar Hero 3, and that backs up the story from last week
4106960	4111880	about Neversoft, who did the Tony Hawk games, are taking over that.
4111880	4116440	He also said this, quote, we are instead working on a different music game project, one that
4116440	4121600	is bigger and more ambitious endeavor than we felt we could pursue with the balance of
4121600	4123120	the Guitar Hero franchise.
4123120	4128600	Further specific details on exact subject and publisher from the game are not yet released.
4128600	4129760	We'll see.
4129760	4133580	You know, I'm thinking though, a lot of people are going, oh, it's Guitar Hero, or it's Guitar
4133580	4138920	Villain, or it's Drum Hero, or it's Keyboard Hero, or it's a sequel to Amplitude of Frequency.
4138920	4143560	I think when this guy uses terms like, we are working on a different music game project
4143560	4147000	that is bigger and more ambitious, I think it's bigger than all that.
4147000	4148000	I think it's different.
4148000	4150440	I think it's something brand new you haven't even thought of yet that Harmonics is working
4150440	4151440	on.
4151440	4152440	I think it's called Huge Ass Symphony, the game.
4152440	4156120	I think it's just some new concept we don't even know yet until we hear it.
4156120	4158300	I think it's Oonga Boonga, the musical.
4158300	4162240	It's Guns and Roses, the game, an ego bigger than Axl Rose.
4162240	4168720	Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, at least for Guitar Hero 2 for Xbox Live, the multiplayer
4168720	4174240	dream has crashed and burned.
4174240	4179680	The guitar still has the microphone in it too, but there's no online multiplayer.
4179680	4186640	All of the modes, co-op face-off, pro face-off modes are offline only, so, sorry y'all.
4186640	4189160	Yeah, it's gotta be lag.
4189160	4190680	I'm pretty much thinking so.
4190680	4197600	But I still think it's cool though, you know, the downloadable packs, because that, it really
4197600	4203580	gives the experience very similar, I think, to Karaoke Revolution on Xbox, but it really
4203580	4210480	gives the game a really, I'd say, a lot of replayability.
4210480	4212920	They should just add, well, I'm sure they'll have a leaderboard.
4212920	4214320	They need the war pack.
4214320	4217520	So that's what they just need to do, stick with the leaderboard.
4217520	4222240	You know, I've given Guitar Hero a little bit of crap on this show, just because I don't
4222240	4225880	foam at the mouth over it like everyone else does, I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Guitar
4225880	4229760	Hero, it's so awesome, and I actually prefer it to Guitar Freaks, I really do, which for
4229760	4234400	somebody with a Bomani, you know, a heart Konami type thing is a huge thing to say.
4234400	4235400	I know, look.
4235400	4237440	It bypasses your Bomani boner?
4237440	4238960	Kind of, in the guitar region it does.
4238960	4244980	I would, you know, I would have five hard-ons somehow if they would make a keyboard game
4244980	4246320	like they did Guitar Hero.
4246320	4248960	I really would, because I'd love to have keyboard mania.
4248960	4251280	You would probably be Edward Penis Hands.
4251280	4252280	Probably.
4252280	4254880	I don't know how it would happen.
4254880	4256720	That's a reference I hadn't heard in forever.
4256720	4261500	I would totally be happy if they would do that, but I am getting more and more excited
4261500	4263720	about its release on the 360.
4263720	4266840	I'm pumped for it, I'm going to definitely pick it out when it comes, or pick it up when
4266840	4267840	it comes out.
4267840	4270420	What about DDR on the 360?
4270420	4273120	You know what, I looked at some, there's some new videos that hit the internet this week,
4273120	4274540	and I think it looks great.
4274540	4275800	I'm really excited about it.
4275800	4276960	I think it's going to be an awesome game.
4276960	4279240	I think my neighbors are going to hate me.
4279240	4282440	Mine are going to hate me too, and I finally need to get my dance pad back from Jamie.
4282440	4283960	She's had it for like a year and a half.
4283960	4286160	I gave, no, I gave it back to you.
4286160	4287160	I don't, no, no, you took-
4287160	4288160	One of the steps didn't work.
4288160	4289600	No, no, that was the old dance pad.
4289600	4292520	You took my other one, because remember when there was a Guitar Hero story?
4292520	4293520	It was in the background.
4293520	4295400	No, you took that back with you.
4295400	4296400	I gave it back to you.
4296400	4297400	No, I don't have it.
4297400	4299280	Well, then it's probably in the vault.
4299280	4301060	She forgot to tell you that she sold it for a pinball machine.
4301060	4302060	She probably did.
4302060	4303100	No, Dan sold it for a pinball machine.
4303100	4305720	She sold it for a pinball- Dude, we got another freaking pinball machine,
4305720	4306720	by the way.
4306720	4307720	We got an Earthshaker.
4307720	4308720	Anyway.
4308720	4311600	I haven't even fucking heard of that.
4311600	4316680	The Rosie O'Donnell pinball machine, the Earthshaker.
4316680	4321200	Actually Earthshaker is in the same family as Roland, it's pretty old school and awesome.
4321200	4324160	One of those machines that collectors want, anyway.
4324160	4328480	I still want my Doctor Who pinball machine, and Dan hasn't accommodated me.
4328480	4333360	Joshi16 has an interesting line in chat, what would Brian Boitano do?
4333360	4336320	Get all the developers in town and make a game to amaze the noobs.
4336320	4337600	That's what Brian Boitano would do.
4337600	4338600	I tried to sing it.
4338600	4339600	That's fantastic.
4339600	4343640	It failed miserably because I had no voice.
4343640	4344640	That's okay.
4344640	4345640	You haven't excused this time.
4345640	4346640	I do.
4346640	4351680	Oh, this is exciting when Dark Soccer is letting me have not just one, but two buys tonight.
4351680	4355800	I got one for Bust a Groove 2, and I got another for my voice.
4355800	4356800	I'm excited.
4356800	4359440	And you were calling me a bitch.
4359440	4362680	If the shoe fits.
4362680	4365200	Very accommodating, Rob.
4365200	4367480	I only punched you because DMN told me to.
4367480	4369200	Well, DMN's a bitch too.
4369200	4371160	He is, but we like his bitchiness.
4371160	4373300	You know there's nothing but heart for the Jamie.
4373300	4374620	Nothing but heart.
4374620	4376000	The bleeding heart.
4376000	4377000	There's a heart.
4377000	4378000	Alright.
4378000	4379000	With a knife through it.
4379000	4382760	We're going to go to a quick break here and come back in a little bit with Orange
4382760	4387000	Lounge Radio Part B because Jamie and I have to have a hug-a-thon to make up for all the
4387000	4391840	fighting we're doing tonight, so we're going to have a hug-a-thon during the break.
4391840	4394200	So we'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4394200	4397320	For those of you guys listening on our audio archive, also known as podcasting, we'll be
4397320	4401160	back in a couple days, probably about Wednesday-ish, with Part B.
