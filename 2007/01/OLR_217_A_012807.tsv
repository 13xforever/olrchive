13954	25266	Tonight, January 28th, 2007, Wii gets a new channel and rumors circulate of another, Sony gets confused about its own game, and a new PC release shatters sales records.
32165	36788	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36868	42192	We are that video game podcast dedicated to video games, the gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42793	44474	I'm here to help you through the next few hours.
44554	45555	My name is Rob Roberts.
45575	46676	You might know me as Sky.
46776	50458	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
50959	51559	Roar.
51920	52400	How you doing?
52941	53021	Roar!
53041	53662	Roar!
77290	78311	and DarkSakura.com.
95803	100166	I know, but I was saying it for the sake of the noise that it was making.
100346	100986	It was pretty bad.
101026	102627	The death noise.
102727	104008	You want to know what death metal is?
104068	105348	Just let your brakes grind.
105548	108110	I thought her tire was flat, actually, is what I thought it was.
108310	111372	And then I got out of the car and I poked all the tires and they were fine.
111472	112292	I said, oh, you're fucked.
113293	114173	Rob probed my car.
114753	115034	I did.
115194	115694	It was great.
116574	117495	You're the one who had the probe.
117955	121037	Say hello as well to the always probing Techmaster Loki.
122956	124977	You might want to turn that mic on so you can talk to us tonight.
125037	125277	Hello.
125637	127498	Hey, how you doing?
127518	127858	Good.
127878	130220	217 weeks, we're still having difficulty turning on our microphone.
130240	132161	Yeah, I don't check these things.
132841	133861	And I turned it off, too.
133901	134862	I was the one that did that, so.
135362	136182	How was your week?
136583	137543	You had a pretty good week?
137883	138504	Yeah, it was okay.
138744	139084	That was good.
140465	141465	I apologize in advance.
141505	143386	I've kind of lost my voice somewhat tonight.
143406	147468	You're going to hear that my voice is kind of scratchy, and I'm doing my best trying to drink some tea and coffee, but...
148191	153554	Those folks that have emailed us or posted on web forums that Rob talks too much on the show.
153614	154994	Rob should shut up once in a while.
155855	159396	You're probably going to get your wish tonight because, as you can hear, I'm strained a little bit.
159737	161157	We've got some emergency for you.
161377	161597	I know.
161617	166800	I'm probably going to drink some a little later, but I need hot drinks for the throat, so I've been drinking some green tea.
166820	167180	Boil it.
167200	168221	We'll make some coffee later.
168701	169101	Boil it.
169181	170562	It'll be lovely and nasty.
170582	171762	I might try it.
171782	172102	We'll see.
172483	173123	I can drink whatever.
173649	175610	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
200741	225790	Um, I played a little bit more Cooking Mama, um, I haven't really had time to play much of anything as far as actual games go, um, although I'm really thinking I'm gonna actually, um, stick with Guild Wars for my game of choice, um, I might play, um, World of Warcraft, but right now I really don't have time with school, my education really is, is the focus, but last night I was over here while Rob was off in, uh, Rocky Land, and, uh, I was watching, uh,
226650	230593	and Miklatov played through Silent Hill 2, which was awesome, but it wasn't scary to me.
231474	245424	There's only, like, one thing that really freaked me out, and I don't even remember what that... I think it was climbing down the ladder and having, you know, Pyramid Head just be there, and that spooked me a little bit, so... That was really it.
245564	246785	Oh, and I played some pinball.
247045	248166	I downloaded a game for my phone, though.
248606	250928	I downloaded Pac-Man pinball, and it's ass.
252589	253230	What's wrong with it?
253410	254150	It's just boring.
254410	254991	It's not very...
255860	257401	It's two fields and that's it.
257721	259021	Is it just a normal pinball game?
259081	260302	Yeah.
260342	261022	Stupid.
261062	261502	Sounds boring.
261522	264043	They should do virtual pinball for the phones.
264083	264923	I can play Black Knight.
265083	266424	Are there cell phone games you enjoy?
266484	267864	Because there's only one or two I enjoy.
267924	272206	I have two that I play and that's Luminous and Bejeweled.
273026	276328	The only two I play are Luminous and Super Pac-Man.
278508	280229	You know, Super Pac-Man is really hard to play on my phone.
281111	287015	I would much rather play it on an arcade machine or something, but it's not bad for on the go.
287195	292899	I did delete virtual pinball off of my computer because it turned out that I had no space left and I managed to free up 17 gig.
293400	293940	Jesus.
294961	296402	Oh yeah.
296482	297823	On a 250 gigabyte hard drive.
298563	300845	It's all the TV I'm downloading.
301125	304067	Thanks to certain people who are trying to get me into watching Heroes.
304287	304728	It worked.
305808	306549	Bite my ass.
307431	311093	I'm going to also introduce our invisible fourth guest who's always here with us every week.
311133	315475	That's the chat room because Orange Lounge Radio, we believe in letting you guys be a part of our program.
315816	320638	So if you're listening live to us here on this Sunday evening, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.
320678	324840	Click on chat or I believe you can also just go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
324880	330123	I think our lovely webmaster VX Jason XV set that up quite some time ago and I keep forgetting to announce it that way.
330883	332503	I want to say hi to the noobs.
332723	336524	I know Godlike93 introduced himself as a chatroom noob tonight.
336564	337144	So hi noob!
338224	339805	I think I recognize all the other names.
339845	342285	If I missed any other noobs in chat tonight, I apologize.
343365	346746	The chatroom is pretty much being very foul as to why I have no voice tonight.
347786	349926	NM64 said Sky ate too many dicks.
350227	350687	Screw you.
351607	352027	Screw you.
352447	353587	I just screamed a lot.
354027	358188	I said the F word repeatedly very loudly and that's why I have no voice today.
359172	360833	Of course that doesn't really help, that story does.
360853	363373	No, it does not.
363894	364434	Never mind.
365274	367815	I think I want to edit that out of the show, but we don't do that.
368235	370856	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
371016	372216	My gaming week was fun.
372897	378358	We played, I actually finished Resistance finally, and it's, the end's kind of okay.
378518	379819	They're definitely making another one.
380819	388902	Didn't get a chance to play multiplayer though, I should have done that, but I was too busy playing Crackdown, the demo, and I played that about
390357	397661	Oh, six or seven times all the way through, so, you know, that's over three hours of crackdown, and it's a fun game.
398181	399802	That's exactly what I was hoping it would be.
399822	411629	I mean, it's the perfect game for me because you're this overpowered, like, almost like a superhero type character, just abusing the crap out of the citizens that live in this, you know, one city.
412009	417672	And then I did get to play last night a multiplayer with JeremyTodd100, and it was...
420214	420834	That was fun.
421374	424855	We just kept busting up just how retarded things got.
425455	431236	I kind of couldn't get into the Crackdown demo, but I played it when I didn't have a lot of time to spend with it.
431276	434617	But you and I need to set a time so you can show me what the hell I'm supposed to do in that game.
434637	435817	Because it looks like it's pretty.
436177	437018	It looks like it might be fun.
437518	445399	When you actually sit down and look at some of the detail in it, I mean, there's a lot of cars and people in that, which is a lot more than, say, Saints Row or something like that.
446179	448600	I do like just the amount of detail in it.
449016	478427	and just the fact that when you're not going around and trying to kill people you can climb a lot of stuff in there and that's actually kind of fun also it's kind of a different aspect of the game they reward you for that too in fact one of the achievements is climbing the tower that you start off in and that thing is high I managed to get up about 20, 30, 40 stories and they jumped off of it and landed on a cop to my enjoyment we both exploded once I hit the ground
478993	481175	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
500712	503473	gang leaders in this already in 30 minutes.
503593	508374	Wasn't there some footnote in the demo, though, that said it was moving at an accelerated pace, like the skills was accelerated?
508394	517776	Yeah, the skills were moving, you know, a bit faster, but, you know, if you spend enough time with it leveling up, you just kick the crap out of everybody later on, which is fine, you know, because it's fun.
518596	529718	But co-op is definitely where it's at, and just, I really wish there was more than two players, but even what was kind of weird, though, when you're playing co-op, there was lag, but there was lag on, like,
530581	531062	My end.
531102	534787	Like, I would move and it would be delayed on my screen, which is kind of weird.
535047	535888	But it was fun.
536149	536589	I liked it.
536809	538552	So I can't wait to check out the full game.
539673	539893	All right.
539953	540314	Is that it?
541415	542096	I think that's it, yeah.
542317	542597	All right.
543217	543857	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
572814	601587	I think it kind of proves that putting Heavenly Star in the game was a bit of an afterthought I think it's kind of weird that Heavenly Star is the only song available right now too like don't you remember at E3 there was supposed to be Madonna and they were talking about they were getting together Warner Brothers Records to get all these you know songs you know where did those show up because I think it would have been better if they released a few of those for you know I don't know 400 points or whatever released several of those and had a mode for that like music video mode because the only place that Heavenly Star really works for me is using it in skin edit mode
602153	611215	and when I'm playing it in skin edit mode I don't really play the whole song because you move on to the next skin after four levels and I'm actually getting better at Luminous so I can usually get through four levels in about half the song.
612356	614096	But I can't complain.
614156	614616	It's free.
615156	625679	And I think I applaud Microsoft and Q Entertainment for trying to correct some of the micro transaction mistakes they made by making this content so cheap right now and
626004	626604	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
648885	650788	Let's see, the other game I played was World of Warcraft.
650928	652590	Honestly, I've been getting sucked back into World of Warcraft.
652630	657177	I'm a little 20-torn druid now, which I know some people are probably like, I can do that in no time flat.
657217	657798	Well, you know what?
658426	659086	I have a job.
659486	660586	I have other stuff to do.
662247	663267	I'm having a lot of fun with it.
663727	664767	We've got a guild growing.
664807	666087	We have some OLR listeners in it.
666988	668508	We're over on the Ravencrest server.
668528	670788	If you want to join us, check out the forums for more details.
671268	672729	We're not called OL Army, though.
672769	676369	It's a Silent Hill-based name, actually, for whatever reason.
676789	678290	Shane's running the guild, and that's what he picked.
678330	678730	Miklatov.
678970	679930	You know him as Miklatov on the show.
679970	680650	That's what he picked.
681010	682270	And it's a good name for a Horde guild.
682650	684071	So Horde side, Ravencrest.
684331	684971	Visit the
686443	689644	Orange Launch Radio forums for more detail at OrangeLaunchRadio.com And that's it.
689684	690924	That's pretty much all my gaming week.
691245	692185	Not anything else major.
692325	693665	Just some other little bits here and there.
693705	695006	I think I might have played a game of Heavy Weapon.
695266	695646	That's about it.
696046	697266	Oh yeah, I played Heavy Weapon.
697647	697867	Lame.
698327	698847	You didn't like it?
699007	699827	No, I thought it was stupid.
700027	702928	I thought it was way better than most of the stuff they've been releasing lately.
703228	703789	Oh, that was dumb.
703869	704129	Really?
704909	706729	I'm glad I didn't buy it.
707550	708270	You know what I didn't?
708894	709675	Zeldon Virtual Console
730475	731276	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
755382	757323	and I tried to play Gradius the other night.
757343	758284	That is one of the gameplays.
758324	760785	I played Gradius on the Wii and I sucked.
761406	765348	I couldn't get past the volcanoes in the first level because I swore I was going to do it without cheating.
765588	768290	I can't go back and play Nintendo Gradius though.
768570	771312	I have to play one of the later releases of it.
771812	774214	Does my hand-eye coordination get that bad with age?
774494	775254	You're just old, Rob.
775435	775895	I guess so.
776784	795631	uh comments from chat room JeremyTodd1 says everyone has to buy a link to the past I don't care who you are what you do buy it anyway this game is the best game ever I agree it's probably one of the top five games of all time um HitStun says Heavy Weapon is nice by PopCap standards but that doesn't make it a good game I disagree um
797080	801222	XBS Kid adds on to that saying the PopCap standard is the bottom of the barrel next to Flash games.
801843	802463	I don't know.
802603	805565	There's some pretty crappy stuff on Xbox Live outside the PopCap stuff.
805585	806845	At least there's some playability there.
807266	807586	I don't know.
807766	808306	I disagree.
808847	812929	I don't think PopCap's the best thing ever, OMG, but I think some of the stuff they put out is pretty decent.
813889	815971	Bob Coffee says, don't give in to World of Warcraft.
815991	816331	Too late.
818112	820713	Alpha Canogram says, Sky, I love Heavenly Star.
820773	825836	I'm just annoyed that I can't turn off the sound effects because sometimes I want to hear the actual song while playing.
826243	833586	Yeah, you know how on Luminous, you know, with the songs in the background, the little, like, rotating the shapes will make a noise, and clearing a block off the screen will make a noise?
833826	835227	Some of that does get in the way of the song.
835567	836447	But I don't mind.
836467	837628	And for Shinin', though, wow.
837668	839128	Yeah, and Shinin', it was incredible.
839508	840749	I don't mind it in Heavily Star.
840929	845091	And I think, like, in Hollaback Girl, it's funny, if you have the PSP one.
845751	852034	By the way, I saw Luminous Plus on PS2 for sale the other day, and I remember what you were telling me about how it's, like, it went down in price, right?
852074	852854	Luminous Plus on PS2?
853895	855336	Um, yeah, it's $19.99.
855756	856517	It should be out, though.
856557	858718	It's not coming out until, like, way later.
858919	863242	No, they had it on shelves at a place I went to at a GameStop, which you're usually pretty good about.
863282	865203	Yeah, Luminous Plus doesn't come out until the end of next month.
865223	865583	For real?
865623	866284	I should have bought it.
866904	870406	I swear, they had, like, 40 copies sitting right there on the shelf behind the little thing.
870687	871187	Luminous Plus.
872328	872508	Huh.
873368	874089	Maybe something happened.
874889	876210	Yeah, they shouldn't have that yet.
876411	876871	That's weird.
876951	878552	I'm going to check the web and see if it...
879215	881637	Maybe if they change the price, they bumped up the release date.
881937	883458	I don't really want to get it on PS2, though.
883478	884258	That's too many versions.
884318	885059	I have Xbox Live.
885079	885559	That's good enough.
886680	887900	Then again, it would depend on the songs.
888261	891903	Do they have some good licensed song in Luminous Plus, or is it just a port of the PSP version?
891963	892963	I think it's just a port of the PSP version.
892983	893444	Then forget it.
893784	894124	Forget it.
894664	895165	I don't care, then.
897046	897286	All right.
897888	898709	and DarkSakura.com
924364	928246	So, if you want to vote for an alternative, I suppose you can always vote for Travis.
928386	930167	So, if you want more details, listen to his show.
930868	934089	Saturday nights at 7 o'clock, but not this upcoming week.
934670	938652	DMN's going to call us later in the show because they scored a huge interview for this week.
938772	939552	I'm pretty jealous.
939712	942734	And, Jamie, you are going to be pissed when you find out who it is.
943174	943754	That's all I have to say.
943774	944075	I will.
944175	945716	You're going to be pissed that they're not on this show.
946316	946596	Okay.
946776	949037	Yeah, you're going to want to reach to the screen and punch DMN.
949057	949197	Okay.
949898	950378	It's pretty good.
950398	951519	He'll call in later in the program.
951759	952039	Okay.
952452	957314	DarkSakura wanted to start off tonight's program a little bit, and we promised we wouldn't bring this story up again, but
978632	979973	DarkSakura had something she wanted to say.
979993	982174	She wanted to talk about last week and us talking about it.
982435	983735	And I'll just turn it over to her.
983775	984796	So, DarkSakura, what do you want to say?
985036	989759	Yeah, about the whole two-gallon water drowning lady.
991160	992061	Jennifer Strange, yes?
992081	992601	Yeah, sorry.
992621	993322	Hold your wee for a wee?
993522	993702	KDND?
993722	995403	I can only remember her last name for some reason.
996164	997284	Well, it was pretty strange.
997384	999206	I got all of three emails about it.
1000366	1004189	One of them was just stupid, and I immediately disregarded it because...
1004767	1012209	If you want to make a valid point, don't start off by calling people names and being an idiot, because then I don't respect you, and I will never pay attention to anything you say.
1012309	1014389	Was it like a fuck you, you fucking fuck type of email?
1014409	1017390	Yeah, I'm like, you're an idiot, next.
1018430	1027732	I did, however, receive one that really, I want to say it was a well thought out letter, and I appreciate it.
1028673	1034214	And just because, and I'm going to go ahead and say this, I am, God, chat room, knock it off, shit.
1045808	1062254	What I was going to say before the chat room started acting like they had Tourette's is that I even went back and said, yeah, I don't think it was necessarily a matter of deserving it, but I come from the point of view of accountability for what you do.
1062992	1063852	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1088667	1089888	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1119182	1123003	that it was my choice to get on the roller coaster in the first place.
1123263	1124204	But what a way to go.
1124504	1126464	I know, wouldn't that be awesome?
1126484	1135907	But a friend of mine equated it though with, you know, if you go out, if you're a woman going out at midnight to 7-11, there's a chance that you can get pounced in the alleyway and raped.
1136448	1137708	Well, that's the difference.
1137808	1140829	She wasn't forced down onto the ground and forced water down her throat.
1140869	1145771	She actually chose to do it after there was a warning calling in, after they were saying, do you feel sick?
1145791	1146471	Do you need to stop?
1146511	1146791	People
1147441	1148142	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1163766	1167249	I just think that she had a choice, and that's what I'm saying.
1168110	1172353	I just don't think people should discount the fact that she did have free will involved.
1172994	1173934	And that's what people are doing.
1174154	1180139	Hopefully we can all get past this story, because I know I'm kind of sick of hearing about it, especially living here.
1180259	1184022	Because keep in mind, this was in our backyard, and we are hearing about this nonstop.
1184042	1186384	It's in our paper every day, some type of new development.
1186444	1193290	On top of that, I talked it over with several of my coworkers, lots of my friends, and everyone's saying, did we learn about this in middle school?
1194948	1200493	If you saturate your body with water without replacing sodium, your brain's not going to function.
1200733	1202234	That you learn in middle school.
1202815	1211482	And for me, my whole thing is just that I don't... Yeah, the radio station fully, they are fully responsible.
1212022	1217187	Well, not I'd say fully responsible, but they should be the ones punished for the event, not her.
1217287	1219869	I think that what happened to her is a horrible tragedy.
1220369	1223332	But I think that people should just not say...
1224489	1226611	She had no part in the blame.
1227232	1229113	I hate the word blame.
1229634	1233437	I just think that people should understand she did choose to participate.
1234398	1237120	I don't think this should have happened to her.
1237180	1238422	I don't think any of that should have happened.
1238822	1241845	But just let her be accountable.
1242425	1245628	Let her be posthumously accountable and not the big bad victim.
1245648	1247830	Because we're a country of victims and it's sickening.
1248342	1248582	All right.
1248962	1260685	Well, I'm going to try and keep the show moving, but I do want to say this, just kind of a friendly reminder that Orange on Radio, part of the reason why we're here is to let gamers all have their voice, whether you may agree with it or not.
1260785	1266547	And sometimes it's on a very superficial level, where it's Nintendo versus Sony versus Microsoft.
1266647	1270188	And sometimes we call Sony executives names, and you may not agree with that.
1270228	1270828	And sometimes...
1271428	1272208	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1289528	1296915	Blunt opinions and controversial opinions sometimes, and you may not always agree with it, but we do have the right to have that voice nevertheless.
1297335	1302060	I don't agree with Jamie 100% on this particular thing, but she has the right to say it, and I defend her right to say it.
1302500	1309187	So I also want to kind of get that out, because if you're going to email me saying Jamie should be off the show, that's not going to do any good.
1309207	1309987	Did somebody do that?
1310108	1310868	You were CC'd on it.
1311369	1312690	Oh, was it that?
1312710	1313511	Yeah, we'll talk later.
1313911	1314712	But it was...
1315649	1318431	Yeah, I'm going to be off of the show that I helped make.
1318491	1319331	That's not going to happen.
1319371	1319912	That's stupid.
1319932	1326916	Because she, you know, even if I disagree with her, I think part of the lure of the show is that I can hear her thoughts.
1327757	1329038	Firebomb had pointed it out.
1329538	1332260	It said, but she's a woman and she therefore has no opinion.
1332340	1332820	Why is it?
1333121	1335462	And the only complaints I got were from men.
1336283	1336543	Well...
1337914	1343538	To be fair, we probably have just more men than women that listen to this show, and that's just the culture we're in.
1343698	1353226	I notice, though, in general, that any time I could say something and Matt could say the exact same thing, but I'm the one that gets the emails about it, that I should be quiet.
1353546	1353946	You know what?
1354467	1355267	Hello, universe.
1355488	1356028	I'm a woman.
1356108	1359831	I have an opinion, and you're going to fucking shut up and listen to it, so fuck you.
1361152	1362073	And that's how I feel.
1363174	1371137	But at the same time, you have the right to express your rebuttal arguments with your intelligent emails and phone calls we do later in this program.
1371477	1374779	Jamie's not totally shut off to hearing what else you guys might have to say.
1375379	1375999	No, seriously.
1376399	1379401	You present your rebuttal to me in an intelligent way.
1379461	1380941	I'm more than happy to discuss it with you.
1381502	1384503	I think we can agree to disagree, but I love to hear.
1384523	1385803	I invite anybody.
1385863	1389225	If you've got an opposite opinion to what I have, I love debate.
1389345	1389865	Oh, my God.
1390265	1391806	So prove it.
1391866	1392166	Bring it.
1393005	1394486	I will discuss with you until the cows come home.
1422498	1425500	Yeah, we had a bunch of stories, and not just, you know, release dates and stuff.
1426001	1438631	For example, we had a follow-up to, you know, a game we talked about we announced originally on episode 206, High School Musical the Game, which, you know, to me, I mean, I wasn't too interested about this.
1438711	1440392	It is coming out for the Wii and PlayStation 2.
1442234	1447358	It's based on the Disney Channel, like, musical that they're apparently selling very well on DVD and stuff.
1448334	1460236	But what's actually kind of made it more interesting for me, and as we put on the website earlier this week, High School Musical The Game is actually going to be featuring a microphone peripheral for the Wii, which is kind of neat.
1460736	1462717	So apparently you're going to be singing karaoke.
1462737	1471578	I'm not sure if it's going to be an actual, you know, its own unit, like its own controller, or if it's going to be something that plugs into the bottom of the Wiimote.
1471998	1474979	But either way, you're going to be singing karaoke with this thing.
1475679	1476959	It is going to be coming out now.
1477837	1481821	In August, $69.99 for the bundle.
1482242	1491271	And that's kind of interesting to see some actual companies making some attachments for the Wii other than, say, some stupid steering wheel like the Ubisoft games.
1491991	1494434	But that was kind of neat.
1494634	1497377	Other stuff we announced this week, including...
1498263	1505445	There's going to be a brand new PSP game coming out based on the Girls Gone Wild franchise and it's actually a pool themed game.
1505905	1520828	Originally it was going to be called Pocket Pool by itself and then they picked up the Girls Gone Wild license and now Eidos is producing it and basically it's going to be your standard billiards game but you unlock nudie pictures so who doesn't like some good nudie pictures?
1520868	1521528	Which is hilarious.
1521568	1523528	I think that's a great name for the game by the way.
1523588	1524268	It's hilarious.
1524929	1526769	And then finally we've got
1527693	1528773	Well, actually, some other stuff.
1529093	1532954	Ubisoft, they announced Brothers in Arms War Stories for the DS.
1533374	1541496	Now, I've been reading some other sites out there saying that they've heard the same thing, but they're getting their info from the ESRB website because it was listed on there.
1541736	1543516	But either way, it is coming for the DS.
1544176	1550138	It's going to be coming out on June 13th for $29.99 and should be some interesting stuff.
1550218	1555359	Also, there was a little bit of elaboration for Driver 76, as I mentioned a few episodes back.
1557133	1557553	And then, of course, um...
1569625	1574568	Sega's Virtua Fighter 5, and this is also, you know, the street dates have been listed on other sites.
1574648	1585515	But according to Sega themselves, they signed a six-month exclusive contract with Sony for the PlayStation exclusivity of it.
1586455	1587316	Where did you hear this?
1587336	1589877	Because I haven't heard this anywhere else about this six-month deal.
1590618	1594360	I heard this actually from Sega because they came into our Dallas office yesterday.
1594965	1600729	to do, you know, kind of their lineup of stuff, and I was questioning them about, you know, dates and stuff.
1600909	1606612	At least I was emailing our buyer about dates, and she said that they're on a six-month exclusive deal.
1606932	1613837	So, and that, I know GameStop had a tentative date on their website as, what was it, August something.
1614297	1621101	It was towards the end of August, but it would be six months from when it's actually released in February for the PlayStation 3.
1621982	1622642	So, but, um,
1623769	1625049	Yeah, so that's kind of interesting.
1626170	1630831	And, yeah, as far as, that was the exclusive news we had.
1631231	1633352	Oh, I'm sorry, and then of course my favorite one here.
1633992	1637013	The two Konami Wii titles that are going to be coming out in March.
1637213	1646876	They announced Wing Island and Kororinpa Marble Mania is going to be coming out as well for the Wii.
1646976	1650717	Both are going to be pretty reasonably priced, only $39.99 for each.
1651157	1652278	Both coming out on the 28th.
1654361	1654861	of March.
1655781	1661023	So I'm sure we'll have more info about that next week after Konami's Gamer's Day.
1661403	1663844	But that was some interesting stuff.
1663864	1668605	Wait, was that Koro as in like C-H-O-R-O or Koro as in... K-O-R-O.
1668825	1669105	Okay.
1669445	1672186	Because I want another Koro game.
1672926	1678368	Anyways, there was some other stuff, other announcements regarding dates as well.
1679901	1680962	This one, Rob, you're going to like.
1681102	1682302	Elevator Action for the Wii.
1682422	1683963	It's coming out on June 13th.
1684103	1685884	That's a pretty rad arcade game.
1685924	1687324	I'd be curious to see what they do with it.
1687764	1687985	Yeah.
1688585	1694868	And, of course, Bladestorm's been delayed on the PlayStation 3 to June 15th as well.
1695768	1700750	Call of Juarez for the Xbox 360 is coming out on June 15th.
1701531	1707213	And Turok for the PlayStation 3 and 360 also going to be coming out in September on the 12th.
1709992	1711773	So, lots of good stuff.
1711793	1717778	And I'll, of course, be posting more dates to our under-the-radar thread that we have on the forums.
1718178	1719158	So, keep an eye on that.
1720099	1720459	I will.
1721943	1729065	All right, well, speaking of the Wii, I guess we're getting elevator action pretty soon, and now we're getting rumors about new channels that could be coming to the Wii.
1729405	1737268	I mean, when the Wii went out and they first announced the Wii, we all knew we were going to be getting, you know, the forecast channel, the news channel, the internet channel at some point.
1737688	1746831	Well, now there are rumors of a game channel, and this was spurred by remarks that were made by John Lee, who is the Hudson Entertainment Director of Marketing.
1747594	1765076	He didn't say anything too specific about it, but when he was asked about downloadable games for the Wii, this was his quote, quote, however, in the future, you should rephrase that question to, are there any plans to launch original content on some downloadable service on the Wii, and you might get a different answer.
1765726	1770508	Now, Nintendo, of course, said, you know, we cannot confirm what format the new content will be delivered.
1770548	1772649	There will be original games at the Wii Shop eventually.
1773149	1775390	But it could be interesting because this is launching speculation.
1775410	1783993	It might be just a whole new channel to separate classic Nintendo titles and these, you know, downloadable titles in a new channel by itself.
1784414	1787575	Why couldn't he just not be a jackass about the whole thing?
1787615	1788575	What do you mean?
1788615	1789316	I'm sorry.
1789456	1792397	I can't answer your question because you didn't ask me the correct question.
1793135	1793915	Riddle me this!
1794516	1798317	You know, there are NDAs and things, so I think he's trying to think of a clever way around it.
1798358	1799438	I don't think he's a jackass.
1800078	1810163	But then, I mean, there's just like, it's like, you know, if you're asking, say, for example, imagine you're asking Sony when the PlayStation 3 is going to be coming out in the UK or something like that.
1810563	1815986	You're like, so, when are you guys going to be releasing the PlayStation 3 in the UK?
1816366	1818687	I'm sorry, you did not ask the correct question.
1819187	1820668	Misquestion in the form of a walrus.
1822336	1823138	Like Jeopardy
1835948	1838689	Firebomb asks an interesting question out of left field here a little bit.
1838709	1842111	It says, weren't we supposed to have different colors for Wii consoles by now?
1842251	1843511	I want to say I read a story.
1843592	1855117	It's not in our show world tonight, but I want to say I read a story somewhere on the internet earlier this week about that, yeah, they were going to do different colors, but since they're having trouble keeping the gray ones on shelves as it is, that the new colors are going to be quite some ways off.
1855497	1858598	New colors will be something they do when they want to sell more systems.
1858958	1860099	They're not going to do it right now.
1860899	1861420	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1874028	1875589	Dually shit that you don't need for it.
1875969	1877510	It's very interesting to see how the Wii is.
1877530	1879271	You know, I'm just thinking about this because I read it today.
1879331	1882654	One of my friends on LiveJournal, my old roommate, who wasn't much of a gamer.
1882814	1885235	Remember the very first OLR studio, my roommate there?
1887257	1888878	He wasn't that super into games.
1888898	1891599	He always kind of thought the show he did was kind of weird, but he thought it was cool, right?
1891920	1895502	Well, he made this post in LiveJournal today about how he wants a Wii because he played one over the weekend.
1895522	1896583	He thought it was awesome.
1896663	1898784	He says, I don't really get into video games, but the Wii was fun.
1899224	1901186	It's very interesting to read things like that.
1901326	1903407	It's so interesting to read from the not...
1904027	1908148	Take some time away from the game blogs once in a while to read what other people have to say.
1908188	1909169	It's just very interesting.
1909769	1912189	I think Nintendo's very, very happy at a reaction like that.
1912870	1914170	That was their goal, was it not?
1914310	1915190	I suppose it was.
1916390	1920872	Well, we have actually a little bit more coming from Nintendo, specifically about the channels.
1921772	1927373	The news channel, there's a pretty good review of it, I found.
1928114	1930874	Have you... I've played with the news channel.
1930894	1932135	I played with that a little bit this week.
1932415	1932795	It was fun.
1933174	1936335	Well, basically, the news channel, and this is a couple things that I like about it.
1936835	1938956	It seems like it's got pretty easy browsing to it.
1939577	1941257	It brings up your local news based on your area.
1941297	1946059	You can click on Globe, though, and it shows you where you are in relation to the rest of the world.
1946459	1947080	That's pretty cool.
1949040	1951101	You can also, there's a slideshow.
1952962	1956663	You can see the headlines come through at the bottom half, and you pick wherever.
1959033	1964960	You bring up any of the stories that come up on the slideshow by pressing A. It's pretty easy to follow, I think.
1968044	1977616	It's looking like, they said that the relaunch of it is going to be later this year and it's going to be free and offer more regions available for viewing.
1978308	1982270	But so far it seems so, you know, so far so good pretty much.
1982611	1983491	I actually like it quite a bit.
1983511	1985272	I like it more than I like the forecast channel.
1985793	1994538	But my only suggestion for the news channel would be that, you know how the forecast channel has the temperature and things in the Wii browser?
1994578	2000361	Like you don't have to launch the forecast channel just to see the temperature, although it's horribly out of date, at least for this region.
2000401	2002983	Like it never updates after midnight or 6 a.m.
2003283	2004624	Like it never updates for the rest of the day.
2004984	2005705	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2023727	2028410	You have links to news articles usually or RSS feeds that run kind of along the side of your email.
2028691	2031092	And sometimes that's what makes me stop and go, oh, that sounds interesting.
2031112	2038137	That's actually why I stopped using most of those because my email is through my friend Julie's server and I don't have to worry about any of that.
2038533	2040515	But I don't mind it.
2040895	2042636	That's why I have a Yahoo page.
2042696	2044798	That's why I use Firefox ad block and stuff.
2045158	2048400	But yeah, when you use Yahoo Mail, it shows you some of the top headlines.
2048520	2050602	I stopped using Yahoo Mail just because of that.
2051903	2057347	I like to have my news where I can, you know, if I'm going for news, I'm going specifically for news.
2057707	2061850	That's why the first thing that I have pull up is my Yahoo page and I have my world events and all that listing.
2062271	2064252	I would really, though, this is my hope.
2064312	2066694	I'm not quite sure what their news source is.
2067521	2069582	But I hope that they don't go with... Associated Press.
2069802	2071443	They have a two-year agreement with Associated Press.
2071603	2071843	Okay.
2072023	2079326	Well, I still... I'm very leery about most of our press publications just because there's a lot of bias, a lot of...
2083176	2090040	Well, you know what I thought was hilarious is, you know, of course, one of the first places I went to look for stories locally once I got to the globe was Sacramento.
2090520	2099166	And guess what the top news story was in the Sacramento region on the news channel was about the, you know, again, here's more news in the hold your wee for a wee thing as if we could have more.
2099186	2101387	I was reading BBC News and saw crap on it.
2101687	2103229	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2121667	2124169	So it was interesting that that was on the news channel.
2125090	2128653	And you could even see a picture of a PlayStation 3, and it was kind of one of those moments.
2128693	2133237	It was like the very first time you see the Nintendo and Sega logos on the screen together, like when you boot up F-Zero.
2133557	2136279	It was one of those moments, like looking at a picture of a PlayStation 3 on your Wii.
2136479	2136839	It was weird.
2137640	2138080	It was very awkward.
2138100	2140322	Or like you with your Elebits icon on Xbox Live.
2140342	2140703	That's true.
2141063	2145226	My Friends list icon on Xbox Live is an Elebit, so I guess it's not the first time.
2145406	2148369	And you know, at one time, my background was a picture of Mario Kart.
2148814	2151675	Because that was when I was playing around with using backgrounds from the computer.
2152476	2155177	So, just fun to do little things like that, I suppose.
2155578	2156298	I like irony.
2158059	2162681	Anyways, speaking about the Wii, there's going to be some fun stuff coming to the Virtual Console soon.
2163182	2171666	And one of the biggest games coming to the Virtual Console, and only to Trump, was it last week's Link to the Past?
2172961	2178483	Legend of Zelda The Ocarina of Time is going to be heading to at least the Japanese Virtual Console in February.
2179103	2189185	It's going to be slated for 1,200 points and of course is going to make it to the United States shortly after the Japanese one, if not the same day.
2191186	2191626	That's awesome.
2192206	2193046	Not interested.
2194527	2195847	Okay, well that's awesome for other people.
2196497	2199400	I'm not interested either because I had it on GameCube for the longest time.
2199740	2200440	Exactly.
2200641	2202482	And the Wii can play GameCube games.
2202682	2203703	So what's the point?
2204043	2206185	Like, I, you know, I understand.
2206245	2212150	Sometimes people go like, well, Rob, then why do you bother downloading anything on there at all when you can just use emulators?
2212270	2214992	Okay, because I can't use emulators on my TV with a wireless remote.
2215032	2216634	I'm just too lazy to set that thing up.
2216994	2218796	And I like the authentic experience.
2219316	2223219	But using that little GameCube disc with the Zelda game on it is a pretty authentic experience.
2224680	2224821	Yeah.
2225101	2225241	So...
2226901	2228362	I don't get the point of downloading it.
2228382	2229583	I'm going to be downloading Mario Kart.
2229803	2230803	But here's the best part, though.
2233424	2238006	When this game does come out, it's going to be great, and people are going to download it and stuff.
2238026	2248251	Then later on down the line, remember how they were talking about, oh, yeah, well, we can do a line of games, and thank the Game Boy Advance here when they released the old Nintendo games for it again.
2248831	2255574	We can do a line of games that are just GameCube and maybe Nintendo 64 games ported over with the controls for the Wii.
2256297	2268823	So you'd have Mario Kart Double Dash or whatever ported over and being sold for $29.99 or something like that with just no changes whatsoever other than the controls for the Wii.
2270624	2277707	Watch this kind of happen or they release some sort of collector's edition of all the Zelda games or something again.
2280257	2282059	I'm reading what the chat room has to say on this.
2282099	2285742	Jeremy Todd 1 says, I have played and beat Ocarina of Time a few too many times now.
2286242	2293748	I beat it on 64, I beat it on the GameCube, I beat it on the computer, whistles, and like OLR said, I have the GameCube game so I can just play that.
2294689	2301935	GS68 would like to point out, you know, playing the Ocarina is kind of hell with the C-stick, which doesn't make sense because you didn't have the buttons on the GameCube, you had that stick.
2302495	2303376	So, well...
2303852	2304432	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2326817	2340589	Kama Itachi no Yoru, Megami Tensei, Super Goals and Ghosts, Sango Kushi 4, Bare Knuckles, Streets of Rage, Beyond Oasis, Vector Man, Sword of Vermilion,
2345248	2372374	Vigilante on TurboGrafx-16, Chu Man Fu, Yokai Doshuki, and Wonder Momo also all coming out on TurboGrafx-16 so sounds like there's a lot of cool stuff coming out on your Japanese Virtual Console and many of those titles that do have American versions will probably be seeing those before too long Bare Knuckle, that brings back memories because we picked up the Japanese cart and used a converter on it to play on our Nomad and it played it as Street to Rage and it was a Bare Knuckle cart
2373055	2373555	That's weird.
2373595	2374276	How did it know that?
2375097	2376337	Sometimes they'll do that.
2376918	2384904	Actually, a lot of the Neo Geo games will have a Switch, so you can play them in either version.
2385384	2391748	Our Japanese Samurai Spirits 2 is Samurai Shodown 2, and it'll play depending on what mode we have it in.
2392369	2399314	You know what I'd like to see Nintendo do, and this is going to seem completely out of left field, but I would like to see them release some Japanese games that never got released here.
2400245	2426126	You know, and just, I mean, I guess local Freaking Panorama Cotton, hi Well, okay, that's a little obscure, but I'm thinking Earthbound on the NES, Mother Zero or whatever it's, or no, the original Mother, which we call Earthbound Zero on that translated ROM No, it wasn't a translated ROM, it was a ROM that somebody bought on eBay, which is a prototype So it's like that game is floating around there, half done Wouldn't that be awesome if that, like, came out on the virtual console?
2426846	2427587	I agree I don't know
2428061	2433422	Maybe that's just too much work, but I can't believe that Nintendo isn't making an arm and a leg off a lot of these Virtual Console games.
2433563	2435343	We need the freaking TurboGrafx Twinbee.
2436683	2437103	Oh, we'll see.
2437184	2437764	And Parodius.
2437924	2438724	We need Parodius.
2438864	2439464	We'll see.
2440744	2441085	Anyway.
2441525	2450227	Well, something that will make a lot of people happy, speaking of Virtual Console, is Mario Kart 64 is going to be on Virtual Console in Europe.
2450327	2456049	It's actually the second Nintendo 64 title to be on the European Virtual Console.
2457009	2457089	Um...
2459838	2463100	It's really, it's Mario Kart.
2464081	2473807	There's really not much else to be said about it, but there's also a notice that Soldier Blade, which is a TurboGrafx-16 game, is also going to be available for 600 points.
2475568	2477910	Well, everybody's getting in on the Mario Kart love now.
2478230	2480832	It's nice to see another Nintendo 64 title get up there, though.
2481465	2486088	And I'll tell you, Mario Kart on the 64 was the best version next to the original.
2486508	2487949	All you need is Pokemon Snap.
2487989	2488830	Toad's Highway.
2489210	2489791	End of story.
2490151	2491011	Pokemon Snap.
2491732	2492212	I would agree.
2492272	2493733	Pokemon Snap would be pretty awesome.
2495014	2495734	How about Superman 64?
2495815	2498476	Oh, fuck no.
2498857	2499657	That was so funny.
2499717	2500938	That'd be kind of cool.
2500958	2502479	Blast Corpse or something like that.
2503266	2508087	Pokemon Puzzle League Actually, GoldenEye64 You know what you'd probably like?
2508447	2521231	Dream on, it's a rare game Once they start doing the light gun games and stuff They should do... Super Scope Well, Super Scope would be awesome But the Pokemon Snap or something like that
2522051	2523491	How awesome was the Super Scope?
2523531	2524812	It was a bazooka for God's sake.
2524852	2525712	It was awesome.
2525932	2527412	I know, I think it was hard.
2527532	2538195	I remember sitting playing, because I had a Super Scope when they came out, sitting there playing freaking Blastress for long enough to wear out the battery in the Super Scope.
2538215	2540035	It was six hours.
2540475	2542336	Ooh, I have some folks agreeing with me in chat room.
2542796	2545097	Alex says, Pokemon Puzzle League FTW.
2545557	2547377	Rama says, I like Pokemon Puzzle League.
2548157	2548757	I know what's up.
2549038	2550858	I want a Super Scope just to put on my desk.
2551801	2552381	I have one.
2552521	2554522	You can probably get one at the auction.
2554862	2555382	I have one.
2555402	2555942	Do you want it?
2557023	2557283	Sure.
2557323	2557723	I'll take it.
2557923	2559564	I'll see if we can find it.
2559724	2561264	We actually have a Menacer somewhere, too.
2562325	2567306	The attachment that hooks onto the Master System gun.
2567987	2572148	JVmon's leading a chant in the chatroom for Yoshi's Safari with the Wii remote.
2572188	2572908	That might be kind of fun.
2573308	2574389	We need more Metal Slug.
2575509	2576229	What are you talking about?
2576269	2578130	There's the fucking anthologies out on Wii.
2578450	2578730	I know.
2578790	2579170	I have it.
2579290	2580471	But we need more Metal Slug anyway.
2580571	2581111	No, we don't.
2583055	2584256	I like how we did that in unison.
2585176	2586016	Great minds think like me.
2586336	2589277	Okay, no, Wrestlemania 2000 should definitely be on virtual console.
2591598	2592038	Anyways.
2593799	2603021	So, speaking of the Wii, there's one website that's actually creating sculptures of Miis, which is kind of cool.
2603142	2610964	AllisonQMcCarthy.com She's actually, well, obviously her name's not .com, but you know what I mean.
2611545	2612245	Thank you for watching.
2612305	2613265	I'll see you next time.
2636234	2637856	They should totally have a service like that.
2637896	2638816	I mean, think about it.
2638836	2641539	They're doing the same thing for Spore, where you can create your own custom stuff.
2641559	2644402	That made me think of the exact same thing, like you can print your monsters for Spore.
2644782	2646164	Dude, I'm looking at this.
2647084	2647685	I can do these.
2648366	2649907	So, I mean, I think... Well, then do it.
2650007	2650508	Make me one.
2650988	2654011	I still have to do... I have two more Dolphys to face up on.
2654031	2654532	You're a woman.
2654552	2655473	You can make things, right?
2655633	2657014	Hey, Rob, bite my ass.
2658395	2659977	But anyways... Are they like little bobbleheads?
2661000	2661360	Sort of.
2661601	2663682	I mean, they sort of look like a bobblehead.
2663702	2665683	They look like they're made from stuff at Michael's.
2666883	2667784	I think it looks cute.
2668284	2670786	They are cute, but... Make me one.
2671686	2674428	Yeah, the stuff that's on these, you can buy them at Michael's.
2674448	2675608	Why don't you put up a shut-up, Jamie?
2676809	2679210	No, seriously, I'll do one once I have time between classes.
2679450	2679791	Awesome.
2680631	2681451	I got free stuff.
2681512	2689476	So definitely keep an eye on AllisonQMcCarthy.com and maybe square yourself your own me.
2690851	2691891	How much are they charging for the Miis?
2692852	2701815	Not saying yet because I think she's just starting off with this and got picked up by everywhere and now they're getting inundated with requests.
2702035	2702475	Poor thing.
2703596	2705476	One of the downsides to getting digged.
2706617	2707197	Was that on dig?
2707357	2707917	I'm pretty sure it was.
2707957	2708718	I think it probably was.
2709398	2709658	All right.
2710160	2714042	Well, Nintendo's really digging the recent sales of the Wii.
2714122	2715922	I mean, the Wii has just been selling like crazy.
2717003	2721304	3.2 million Wiis sold is what Nintendo announced earlier this week.
2722105	2722985	That's pretty crazy.
2723625	2724326	There's not a lot else.
2724486	2725606	I mean, what else can you say about that?
2725626	2726987	They sold 3.2 million Wiis.
2727007	2727447	That's a lot.
2728187	2729248	And certainly interesting.
2729268	2731028	Now, I don't mean to sound anti-Sony.
2731048	2732609	That's not what I'm trying to do here.
2732629	2735050	But it is interesting when you see a thing like this.
2735745	2736045	Nintendo DS
2759244	2761325	I wonder if Sony is going to start pissing their pants.
2780228	2780588	I don't know.
2781149	2783630	No, they'll have some creative little press release for this.
2783650	2785371	It'll be all the drugs that Kutaragi's taking.
2786111	2790114	Blackboy in chat sums it up, says, God, Nintendo is making money hand over fist.
2791654	2794696	Nintendo is selling in a month and a half with 360 cells in a quarter.
2795737	2796157	Interesting.
2797293	2800736	Also, we have something, a comment on a story we did a little bit ago.
2800796	2807583	Cutie Honey is in chat and says, the only Metal Slug America is missing is Metal Slug 3D, which isn't terribly good.
2807643	2810446	And I think that's to go along with your comment on we need more Metal Slug.
2810726	2811607	And now I said, no, we don't.
2813428	2815290	Metal Slug has to stay two-dimensional.
2815951	2816812	That's just the awesomeness of it.
2819594	2821395	I give Metal Slug a lot of crap.
2821435	2822136	It is kind of fun.
2822336	2824778	I mean, I just give Jamie crap for it because she never shuts up about it.
2824798	2825878	But 3D, no, no, no.
2826419	2827440	Metal Slug 3D, no, no, no.
2828300	2829661	I haven't played it, but I'm not interested.
2829881	2832683	If you want to play Metal Slug going the other direction, just play Shock Troopers.
2834284	2834564	Okay.
2835525	2840088	Anyways, off the topic of Metal Slug, but still an awesome game.
2840628	2842830	Scarface is coming out.
2843171	2852794	For the Wii, and that's awesome, because apparently, I was reading on some of the features of this, you're going to be able to wield a chainsaw and use the Wiimote to chop off limbs.
2852994	2854735	Thank God, this is what we needed.
2855675	2857535	This is awesome, what are you talking about?
2858576	2861017	No, I'm serious, this really is what we needed.
2861417	2862517	Like, you know, come on.
2863012	2871219	Ever since we heard the Wii is like GameCube with a Nitro boost in it, it's like, well, then where's my fucking Resident Evil 4 with my chainsaw?
2871339	2871780	Come on.
2872280	2874882	I mean, it's just, I don't know.
2875002	2876844	Words cannot describe how happy I am.
2877184	2884931	And to be honest, I mean, I was kind of interested in the Godfather game coming out in March, but... Do you get to whack people with the Wiimote?
2885431	2888834	You do get to manhandle people, though, with the Wiimote.
2889054	2889775	Could you say that again?
2890242	2894246	Manhandle people with the Wiimote That sounds pretty fun
2911738	2919146	Well, while we wait for Scarface to come out on the Wii, he could go to a completely different genre, yet on another Nintendo system.
2919527	2920548	Remember the Game Boy Advance?
2921161	2921982	Final Fantasy 6 Advance Release
2944878	2946079	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2973344	2979867	That's interesting because this website that I'm looking at the story on, SiliconEra.com, actually poses the same question.
2979968	2981188	Is Terra going to be Tina?
2981608	2982629	Why did they change that?
2983449	2983909	I have no idea.
2983929	2986671	Because Tina is such a bad word.
2987271	2990293	Maybe is it because Tina sounds more American than Terra?
2990913	2991373	I don't know.
2991753	2995775	Yeah, for anyone who doesn't know, Terra's original name in the Japanese Final Fantasy VI was Tina.
2996976	2998217	Oh, wait, no, I guess that's the other way around.
2998357	2999617	That's right.
2999677	3000798	I've played the Japanese one.
3002119	3004921	So I'm sorry, yeah, I guess it was Terra here.
3005041	3007883	Were they going for maybe the double entendre, where Terra's kind of like Earth?
3008124	3009284	I don't... Maybe.
3009465	3009845	I don't know.
3010625	3011306	Seems a little silly.
3011746	3013548	It's just like the whole Eris, Aerith thing.
3015289	3015589	Isn't it?
3016570	3024116	Aerith makes more sense, but then again, if you translate it by the kana, it would kind of... Aerith would also make sense for translation purposes.
3024356	3024516	Hmm.
3025928	3031830	Well, one thing that Jamie probably uses to do her translation is several websites out there on the internet.
3031910	3037733	And certainly she likes to surf the internet up and down and back and forth every week finding her favorites of the internet.
3037753	3040194	And it makes up DarkSakura's website of the week.
3041094	3044155	DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers this week?
3046136	3048697	You should actually be going to PayPal and send me money.
3050098	3050838	No, really.
3051218	3052739	And it's not a Doctor Who site.
3052799	3053819	Okay, I'll do one next week.
3053879	3054059	Okay.
3057372	3066937	The website of the week is MassageTherapy.com I've been spending a lot of time there because I'm in school to be a massage therapist.
3067538	3075582	It's really good though because it has a lot about learning about massage, finding a massage therapist for your own needs, media.
3076002	3082106	One thing that I really think is cool in here is there's a body work glossary in here.
3082782	3091626	that lists out a lot of different things you might hear as far as naturopathy, different type of health-related things.
3091666	3092947	I think it's really cool.
3094328	3098950	I've learned actually a lot of different modalities just reading through the freaking glossary.
3100050	3109515	So if anyone is into, even if you're not a massage therapist, even if you don't receive massage, if you're into natural health, it's really worth looking through, and it's been very, very educational to me.
3110878	3113940	SSJ100 Matt says, Jamie, there's no happy ending section.
3115342	3115662	Okay.
3117483	3121706	People who give happy endings are not real massage therapists.
3121846	3126770	Now, is that MassageTherapist.com or MassageTheRapist.com?
3127030	3128131	It's Massage Therapy.
3129272	3131854	I don't think that's very funny since this is, you know, my chosen profession.
3131894	3132314	A joke.
3132414	3133375	Jamie, it's a little joke.
3133395	3133695	A little humor.
3133715	3136857	I know, but I don't think it's a funny joke because it's... I thought it was funny.
3136917	3137818	He thought it was funny.
3137878	3138479	Have a little humor.
3138539	3139779	Are either of you massage therapists?
3140120	3140280	No.
3141124	3141664	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3162088	3171814	No, all kidding aside, you may think at first glance that this has nothing to do with gaming, but I say, you know what, if your ass starts to feel numb from so much hardcore gaming, or your back starts, maybe massage therapy's for you.
3172535	3173355	You know what I've noticed?
3174436	3186163	I, actually, since I've started doing massage, as in giving massage, my endurance in cardiovascular work, aerobics, has greatly improved.
3186923	3191066	So, giving a massage is just as healthy as receiving one if you do it the right way.
3192273	3193313	It's good for everybody.
3194314	3194614	Alright.
3195254	3195634	Anyways.
3196534	3208257	Speaking of unhappy endings, apparently there's actually going to be a price increase, sort of, in the Canadian PlayStation 3s.
3208698	3211438	Wait, a price increase for the PlayStation 3?
3213079	3215459	Somebody screwed up somewhere, big time.
3215659	3220601	Someone apparently listened to our contest that we had, you know, with the...
3222593	3223974	PlayStation 3, and more.
3242463	3247466	99.99.
3242583	3247466	It says both Best Buy and Future Shop have the console listed at the new price.
3248207	3250688	And it says the old list price used to be 659.99.
3251108	3255070	Hasn't the console already been out there for some time?
3257231	3259733	I guess that they're increasing price.
3260033	3261394	But here's my thing though.
3261414	3261454	If
3262441	3271246	I don't know if they're having the same situation as we are here, but if they're like, you know, the consoles are rare there, maybe they're just raising prices because they can probably sell them for that.
3271286	3273407	At least throw in a free game, jeez.
3274348	3274648	I don't know.
3274668	3275068	That's silly.
3275668	3278650	Because, you know, Canada sometimes gets bundle packs that we don't get here.
3279691	3286014	So, but yeah, I guess whatever the case is, they're getting hosed over there, so.
3286835	3291117	Well, you know, we don't mean to keep picking on Sony, but look, guys, they just
3291533	3293554	Keep giving us material, what can we say?
3293614	3302380	And Major Nelson over from Microsoft's camp was very quick to point out this week that Sony made a big fat boo-boo on one of their sites.
3302420	3309045	There was a PSP site touting video downloads, and one of the video downloads was for Gran Turismo HD Concept.
3309065	3312387	It was one of the things you could download, try to get people psyched about the PlayStation 3.
3313047	3321173	Well, they had a screenshot on the website from Gran Turismo HD, but, oops, it wasn't actually a screenshot of Gran Turismo HD.
3322033	3325815	It was a screenshot of Project Gotham Racing 3 on Xbox 360.
3326236	3328257	I mean, talk about a fuck-up.
3328477	3337782	I mean, that is... You know that that's just some tiny little mistake some intern probably made somewhere, but still, I mean, not... Where was the QA on that?
3339263	3341604	Something got screwed up big time.
3342144	3347147	And to kind of follow up with that story I was just talking about, according to a Sony rep...
3347697	3348917	That is the actual case.
3349498	3359481	It says, although the suggested retail price of the PlayStation 3 in Canada has not changed, some Canadian retailers have chosen to increase their retail price as a result of the weaker Canadian dollar.
3359521	3366543	This increase is solely at the discretion of the retailer, as Sony Computer Entertainment Canada has not issued a price increase.
3367463	3368464	Thank you for the clarification.
3368484	3369164	That makes more sense.
3369364	3369624	Thank you.
3371058	3372838	I like our chatroom comments.
3372898	3377439	GS68 pokes fun at the Ridge Racer phenomenon going, it's Project Gotham!
3377739	3379179	Project Gotham!
3380200	3380800	Get it?
3381240	3384100	I know, it doesn't have the same thing to it, but I see what he did there.
3384320	3384880	That's pretty good.
3387061	3388741	Well, Sony's still, though.
3389061	3391301	They still have something shoved up their ass, I think.
3392562	3394782	Yeah, you remember us talking about that Ghostbusters game?
3395082	3395382	I do!
3396182	3400363	Well, Zoofly did confirm that they wore
3401667	3404989	Preliminary working on one for Xbox 360.
3405910	3414496	Sony Pictures, however, has pretty much told Zootfly to shut up, pretty much.
3415257	3417578	They've removed the content from their website because of Sony.
3419039	3421661	Any of the content on YouTube has been removed.
3423222	3425844	Maybe that just was a breach of NDA, I think.
3427011	3431272	Heaven forbid someone put something out there that got people excited for Sony.
3432232	3436633	Or it could be the fact that Sony owns the rights to the Ghostbusters movies.
3438233	3439433	Well, I don't know, whatever.
3442454	3444054	Wasn't the game being created for Sony?
3444534	3452475	No, it was being created by Zootfly, and they have to get everyone's permission, or they hadn't gotten the permission from any of the actors.
3452515	3455716	But wasn't it being created by them for a Sony console?
3456127	3458428	No, it's just being created by them because they like Ghostbusters.
3458768	3461510	Oh, I totally misread that story the first time.
3461670	3462150	That's all right.
3463431	3463971	Interesting.
3465932	3469193	Well, yeah, okay, then I guess Sony was just protecting their rights.
3469333	3470294	They're well within their rights.
3470594	3470914	I get it.
3471595	3476797	Well, still, it's never fun to hear about games going away that we were a little bit excited for.
3476857	3478398	In fact, it makes us a little bit angsty.
3478871	3483194	I don't know about you guys, but I get pretty pissed off when games I get excited for get cancelled.
3483755	3486137	And that calls for some FUs of the week.
3486557	3487318	Right, boys and girls?
3488198	3488478	Oh yeah.
3488558	3489099	I guess.
3502129	3505792	The first FU of the week that I have goes towards the...
3507674	3508915	We're in terror on my car.
3509035	3513136	I mean, really, it's not anything that I didn't expect.
3513176	3516137	You know, you drive your car on road trips, it's gonna wear out.
3516858	3520239	But just, it was really kind of freaking me out last night.
3520519	3522680	I didn't expect it to just start grinding that suddenly.
3523400	3526341	And of course, we shelled out $150 for parts.
3526442	3530243	Thankfully, we have a friend who can replace brakes.
3530323	3533724	And brakes on the Mitsubishi Lancer are very thick and easy to replace.
3534445	3535005	What, Robb?
3536312	3536772	I'm not you.
3536792	3537873	I'm thinking about something else.
3538053	3538774	It's not related.
3540855	3544597	Am I not allowed to laugh and have a good time at this show?
3544617	3545838	Not when I'm talking about my car.
3546559	3549801	No, he can laugh.
3549821	3557886	So yeah, a big, big, major Uber FU goes to my car not being immortal, I guess.
3558986	3562849	And another one goes to Rob for parking like an asshole.
3563891	3564351	You know what?
3564371	3567374	Because I had to pick your ass up because your car was in the shop.
3567394	3570636	Had I not had to pick your ass up, I wouldn't have had to repark the car.
3570877	3576321	Rob, tell me, how many times have you been in the car with me when I pulled into a spot and then backed up and adjusted my parking?
3576701	3577882	I don't give a fuck!
3578963	3581445	I had to contort myself to get out of your damn car.
3583387	3585809	And no thank you for the ride or anything like that.
3586309	3588271	You park like an asshole, you jerk.
3588391	3590653	I thanked you for the ride when you picked me up and I gave you cookies.
3591493	3592654	I gave you cookies!
3592674	3593515	Okay, the cookie was good.
3594011	3595132	My cookies are great.
3596353	3598334	My cookies bring all the rubs to my house.
3600055	3601416	I'm bringing more cookies next week, too.
3603257	3603617	Loki.
3604838	3613884	Fuck, you did a superwoman that was in front of me when I was trying to get out of my apartment complex today because she saw us behind her and she walked slower because she's a jackass.
3614905	3617926	Also, another thing, what the hell's the point?
3618287	3623250	I'm looking at decalgirl.com and they have a skin that you can buy for your PlayStation 3 that's black.
3623843	3624683	That's like stupid.
3625164	3629785	Why the hell would I cover my PlayStation 3 with a skin that's the same color as the goddamn PlayStation 3?
3631486	3631866	I don't know.
3631906	3632126	Why?
3632146	3633367	I don't know.
3633387	3634647	Because you're an idiot, I guess.
3635428	3635908	So fuck them.
3637609	3643971	I just want to give an FU of the week to my Saturday, because it kind of sucked, because I had a migraine, which sucks.
3644211	3645092	Like, they really suck.
3645152	3646232	I don't get them very often.
3646252	3647393	When I do, it really sucks.
3647873	3650574	And so I had that, and then I got sick off of dinner, and
3651775	3653036	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3682028	3685309	All those music game franchises, they're so old.
3685949	3696713	Anyways, so to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Bomani, Konami is holding a pop and music culture festival at Tokyo's Lafayette Museum.
3697854	3700155	So that's pretty awesome.
3700255	3702015	Lots of festivities going along with that.
3702256	3705897	Artists performing, DJs, etc.
3707731	3712975	And I'm sure I, like most people, had similar reactions where it's like, 10 years?
3713235	3715296	It's been 10 freaking years?
3715417	3716017	God, I'm old.
3717678	3718579	I know, seriously.
3719500	3721341	I don't know about you guys, but that's my reaction.
3721381	3733970	I remember, you know, when I first saw Bomani, you know, I remember it was at Fanime, and we went up to one of the rooms that was there, and they were playing Beatmania on a PlayStation 3.
3734614	3743220	and they were playing, I remember the song too, it was the Metal Gear Solid theme and I was just like, fucking A, that's awesome.
3743641	3744701	I was like, I gotta buy this.
3745042	3752247	So I did and I played it and I stopped playing it and then next time I saw DDR4th Mix and I was like, ooh, I gotta get that too.
3753348	3761874	And then next thing you know, I'm going to the arcades and I meet these crazy people and they're doing a radio show and my life just spiraled downhill.
3761894	3763515	And here you are, yes, it's all downhill from there.
3764048	3765529	What was your first Bimani?
3766109	3771692	The very first time I saw Bimani, I went to Milpitas Golf Land to play golf, and I saw a bunch of people dancing on the machine.
3771712	3777215	It looked like fun, because I was playing Busta Groove 2 on the PlayStation at the time.
3779336	3782778	I did not know anything about Japanese imports at the time, so I was playing Busta Groove 2.
3782818	3784699	I'm forgiving you.
3785080	3785760	Part of me is.
3785900	3787081	The other part of my heart is breaking.
3787101	3788482	Well, let it break.
3789822	3791043	You're too sassy tonight.
3791641	3793183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3813624	3814464	in Las Vegas.
3814544	3822007	I played at Circus Circus with a guana girl who ended up going on to be some big admin over at that DDR Freak site.
3822587	3824468	But I don't think she really plays much anymore.
3824968	3826389	So that was my first game.
3826409	3828549	She doesn't admin much anymore either.
3828609	3835032	But my first was, and you're going to laugh at this, was when I still lived in Alabama playing BM98.
3835272	3837633	You remember BM98?
3838093	3838833	Loki left the room.
3838873	3839874	I'm stealing a french fry.
3840014	3840554	Give me one too.
3840614	3840994	You want one too?
3841014	3841154	Okay.
3841684	3842384	Give me his toast.
3842845	3843805	You want his toast?
3844526	3845366	Here you go.
3845406	3845786	Here's a fry.
3846307	3846627	Don't tell.
3847367	3848308	Okay, yes, BM98, yeah?
3848368	3849648	Uh-huh.
3851369	3853911	BM98 was awesome because it was customizable.
3853991	3860515	It was one of... I think it was honestly one of the precursors to many of our simulators today.
3861815	3868039	And, you know, so I got to play a lot of the early Beatmania songs probably right around...
3869514	3870674	Actually, yeah, 1998.
3870734	3879336	And then my first DDR was playing the first Mix Home one when I moved out here from Alabama.
3880297	3887839	And then I played my first actual machine at... Don't glare at me.
3887899	3888739	She took one, too.
3889099	3890019	Rob took it for me, though.
3891059	3891980	Is that my 7-up?
3892160	3892920	Is that my 7-up?
3892980	3893720	Then I get a fry.
3894860	3896941	Oh, I don't care if you're eating my food.
3896981	3897721	Rob, go get me a root beer.
3898106	3899166	Do I look like your bitch?
3899547	3899747	Yes.
3902908	3904028	Rob wants to go get me a root beer.
3904048	3905689	That's awesome.
3907890	3921575	But I honestly think that the simulators like BM98 got a lot of people in the very early days of Bimani into these games who might not have otherwise had access to them.
3923496	3924536	I remember trying to make
3925214	3930055	Make a file a long ass time ago for BM98 and I just couldn't do it because I got really bored doing it.
3932636	3937257	And from what I understand, actually, it's sort of seeing a resurgence in fan communities.
3937317	3938078	I think that's kind of cool.
3940218	3944339	My favorite, though, has to be Delight Delight Reduplication.
3944779	3945480	I still have that.
3946580	3946860	Somewhere.
3947674	3959122	I remember how awesome it was when Dance with Intensity came out, and it was just like, wow, this is so much better, and then Step Media came out, and that was pretty cool too, but who'd have thought?
3960643	3969970	Although, slightly related to the family of Bimani games is one, the really horrid game that I think Konami should disavow any knowledge of, and that's Dance Dance Dance.
3970470	3971130	It was shitty.
3972912	3976114	In my professional opinion, as an internet celebrity.
3976618	3982061	Don't you hate it when you think of good ideas, like right when you get back in the chair and somebody in the chat room actually said it.
3982121	3984282	Bandit says, bet he shakes the can.
3984542	3985862	That would have been an awesome idea.
3986262	3988323	No, it didn't.
3988383	3990544	Especially because Jamie's working on her laptop.
3990564	3991125	She would have cried.
3991865	3996327	No, I would have picked up my destroyed laptop and thrown it at your PC.
3997968	3999048	That would have been a fun show.
3999408	4000489	Suddenly we're knocked off air.
4001538	4004540	And then JeremyTodd1 would like to point this out.
4005060	4007742	He sent this to me in a message there in the chat room.
4008302	4011885	And he's sent me a little slip from youparklikeanasshole.com.
4012225	4015647	Although I'd like to point out he didn't even see it, JeremyTodd1.
4015687	4023311	He checked off two spots, one car, a little too close, over the painted lines, diagonal parking, cool car, diagonal parking, not so cool car.
4023331	4025333	And then he checked off other for sucking.
4025353	4025753	For sucking.
4028020	4031302	DMN agrees with me and JeremyTodd1, by the way.
4031383	4034165	For this, JeremyTodd1 gets a kick from the chatroom.
4034245	4035225	We'll just do that.
4035265	4036326	Control, kick.
4036366	4036746	There we go.
4036866	4038107	Nice good kick from the chatroom.
4038468	4041890	DMN wanted me to punch you in the arm, and he gave me a heart if I did it.
4042150	4043311	So, I'm gonna punch Robin.
4043391	4043691	No!
4043852	4044712	I got you a gut!
4045032	4045172	Ow!
4047534	4048615	You're a real bitch tonight.
4049015	4049736	I am not!
4049876	4050656	I'm nice.
4051657	4052578	I gave you cookies.
4055071	4055892	It's always the cookies.
4055912	4057032	It always comes back to the cookies.
4057413	4057713	I know.
4057753	4058833	You did it all for the cookie.
4059174	4059774	All right.
4059954	4062475	Did everybody have fun reminiscing about the Bimani?
4062735	4063856	Yes, and thank you for my root beer.
4063896	4064296	You're welcome.
4064777	4065057	All right.
4065357	4077023	Harmonix talked this week a little bit about something that's not Bimani related because, you know, Harmonix didn't make Bimani, but certainly they're a huge, huge player in the music video game franchise, and they are talking about the guitar.
4077043	4078364	Well, technically they did kind of.
4078939	4079280	DarkSakura,
4094033	4101296	One of the folks that works over at Harmonix, and that would be Daniel Sussman, who is a producer over Harmonix, quote, Here's the official line.
4101356	4104357	Harmonix can confirm that we are not developing Guitar Hero 3.
4104918	4110440	And that backs up the story from last week about Neversoft, who did the Tony Hawk games, are taking over that.
4111873	4122738	He also said this, quote, We are instead working on a different music game project, one that is bigger and more ambitious endeavor than we felt we could pursue with the balance of the Guitar Hero franchise.
4123078	4128060	Further specific details on the exact subject and publisher for the game are not yet released.
4128501	4128961	We'll see.
4129721	4130641	You know what I'm thinking, though?
4130681	4138585	A lot of people are going, Oh, it's Guitar Hero, or it's Guitar Villain, or it's Drum Hero, or it's Keyboard Hero, or it's a sequel to Amplitude or Frequency.
4139205	4147009	I think when this guy uses terms like we are working on a different music game project that is bigger and more ambitious, I think it's bigger than all that.
4147049	4147670	I think it's different.
4147790	4149591	I think it's something brand new you haven't even thought of yet.
4149671	4151652	I think it's called Hugh Jass Symphony the game.
4152072	4156014	I think it's just some new concept we don't even know yet until we hear it.
4156174	4157195	I think it's Oonga Boonga.
4158215	4161217	It's Guns N' Roses the game, an ego bigger than Axl Rose.
4162597	4167300	Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, at least Guitar Hero 2 for Xbox Live...
4167981	4171203	The multiplayer dream has crashed and burned.
4174205	4179548	The guitar still has the microphone in it, too, but there's no online multiplayer.
4179648	4185152	All of the modes, co-op face-off, pro face-off modes, are offline only.
4185172	4187033	Because of lag, probably.
4187053	4187793	Sorry, y'all.
4188033	4188854	Yeah, it's gotta be lag.
4189394	4190695	I'm pretty much thinking so.
4191075	4192096	But I still think it's cool, though.
4193054	4209863	You know, the downloadable packs, because it really gives the experience very similar, I think, to Karaoke Revolution on Xbox, but it really gives the game a really, I'd say, a lot of replayability.
4210424	4213325	They should just add, well, I'm sure they'll have a leaderboard of some sort.
4213345	4214226	They need the war pack.
4214266	4216607	So that's what they just need to do, is stick with the leaderboards.
4217982	4224485	I've given Guitar Hero a little bit of crap on this show just because I don't foam at the mouth over it like everyone else does.
4224505	4225165	I mean, don't get me wrong.
4225325	4226206	I love Guitar Hero.
4226266	4227086	It's so awesome.
4227266	4228927	And I actually prefer it to Guitar Freaks.
4228987	4229467	I really do.
4229527	4234409	Which for somebody with a Bomani, you know, a heart Konami type thing is a huge thing to say.
4234469	4234649	I know.
4234669	4236330	It bypasses your Bomani boner.
4237140	4237680	Kind of.
4237880	4238841	In the guitar region it does.
4239201	4246343	I would have five hard-ons somehow if they would make a keyboard game like they did Guitar Hero.
4246383	4247743	I really would because I love keyboard mania.
4247763	4250984	If you had five hard-ons, you would probably be Edward Penishands.
4251965	4252725	Probably.
4253565	4254546	I don't know how it would happen.
4254626	4256466	That's a reference I hadn't heard in forever.
4256866	4259007	I would totally be happy if they would do that, but
4259983	4262384	I am getting more and more excited about its release on the 360.
4262744	4264705	I'm pumped for it.
4264725	4267385	I'm going to definitely pick it up when it comes out.
4267405	4270006	What about DDR on 360?
4270346	4271007	You know what?
4271207	4274148	There's some new videos that hit the internet this week, and I think it looks great.
4274628	4275768	I'm really excited about it.
4275828	4276948	I think it's going to be an awesome game.
4276968	4278509	I think my neighbors are going to hate me.
4279201	4282322	Mine are going to hate me too, and I finally need to get my dance pad back from Jamie.
4282342	4283623	She's had it for like a year and a half.
4284403	4286384	I gave it back to you.
4286504	4288024	One of the steps didn't work.
4288404	4289565	No, no, that was the old dance pad.
4289585	4292366	You took my other one, because remember when there was a Guitar Hero story?
4292526	4293386	It was in the background.
4294327	4295407	No, you took that back with you.
4295427	4295907	I gave it back to you.
4295927	4296527	No, I don't have it.
4297088	4299048	Well, then it's probably in the vault.
4299208	4300989	She forgot to tell you that she sold it for pinball.
4301009	4301689	She probably did.
4301709	4302950	No, Dan sold it for pinball.
4303050	4304250	She sold it for a pinball.
4304270	4306051	Dude, we got another freaking pinball machine, by the way.
4306211	4307111	We got an earth shaker.
4308212	4308492	Anyway.
4309147	4310368	I haven't even fucking heard of that.
4311588	4314270	The Rosie O'Donnell pinball machine, the Earthshaker.
4316511	4318773	Actually, Earthshaker is in the same family as Whirlwind.
4318813	4320254	It's pretty old school and awesome.
4321194	4322715	One of those machines that collectors want.
4323355	4327778	Anyway, I still want my Doctor Who pinball machine and Dan hasn't accommodated me.
4328567	4331349	Joshi16 has an interesting line in chat.
4331850	4333191	What would Brian Boitano do?
4333291	4336013	Get all the developers in town and make a game to amaze the noobs.
4336174	4337475	That's what Brian Boitano would do.
4337655	4338335	I tried to sing it.
4338355	4338856	That's fantastic.
4339036	4340637	It failed miserably because I had no voice.
4343500	4343960	That's okay.
4343980	4344961	You have an excuse this time.
4345121	4345482	I do.
4345702	4350286	Oh, this is exciting when DarkSakura is letting me have not just one but two buys tonight.
4351767	4355790	I got one for Busta Groove 2 and I got another for my voice.
4355851	4356351	I'm excited.
4357491	4358993	And you were calling me a bitch.
4360854	4362075	If the shoe fits.
4362476	4364577	Very accommodating, Rob.
4365298	4367280	I only punched you because DMN told me to.
4367420	4368761	Well, DMN's a bitch too.
4369181	4371143	He is, but we like his bitchiness.
4371163	4372984	You know there's nothing but heart for the Jamie.
4373124	4373745	Nothing but heart.
4374666	4375747	A bleeding heart.
4375867	4377488	There's a heart.
4377548	4378529	With a knife through it.
4379363	4388070	We're going to go to a quick break here and come back in a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio Part B because Jamie and I have to have a hug-a-thon to make up for all the fighting we're doing tonight.
4388110	4391073	So we're going to have a hug-a-thon during the break.
4391813	4394335	So we'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
