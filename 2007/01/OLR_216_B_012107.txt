Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Mikhail Tov,
was guesting with us during Part A, but he's actually having to take off, so he won't be around for Part B. So bye-bye, Miklatov.
And now we're going to get back into some news.
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight?
I don't want to.
You have to.
Do I have to?
You have to.
Okay.
Well, there is a game to be coming out called Flow that had a December 6 release date.
And I say had.
Wow.
February.
Yeah.
This is a very anticipated online title, though, you know.
I played the little online one.
It's cute.
It should be interesting on a PS3.
It kind of reminds me of, I don't know, Electroplankton for some weird reason.
I love Electroplankton.
It just does.
It kind of reminds me of that for some weird reason.
Speaking of music games, actually, I want to interject this because I forgot to... I left this out of How Was My Gaming Week, and I don't think it's in our show role tonight.
I had a chance, and I can't say how, but I had a chance to play the Dance MMO that's in closed beta right now.
and so I want to give you my thoughts on it.
It's kind of interesting.
There's a couple licensed songs in it and then the rest of it is all normal stuff.
And of course it's set up very similar to DDR.
It's like a mix between DDR and one of those online Korean or Japanese games that people play like R2-B, O2 Jam, those things.
The interface really reminds me of that.
I believe it was developed by one of those companies because it shows the logo there in the beginning.
I noticed a couple of licensed songs.
There was a Madonna song in there, but an old one.
I think it was like Papa Don't Preach was in there.
And then, of course, I remember Jump Around, Jump Around, Jump Up, Jump Up was in there, that song.
But some of the steps are pretty atrocious.
That's what I noticed.
It starts getting to be very in-the-groove level difficulty when you get up pretty high, which on your fingers is... I'm serious.
Some of these steps are just too crazy.
It's like finger-finger mania or something.
I had a... I had a...
Fairly okay time with it.
Screams polished to me.
I hope they don't... No, I think they're going to add more stuff to it.
And I hear it's changing a lot.
Like, you'll notice things get added and disappear.
So I think they're still putting some tweaks on it.
There's probably some more songs that have yet to go into it.
And I imagine... They're probably still trying to figure out what the model's going to be.
I'm pretty sure the game is going to be free, which I hope it is, because I couldn't see myself paying much more than, like, ten bucks for it.
I understand there might be licenses in the game and stuff, but the game itself just not... I mean, how many people play DDR on the PC?
Not enough, in my opinion.
It's really tough when there's a big DDR simulator out there that's free and has thousands upon thousands of tracks freely available out there.
Alright, so anyway, I just wanted to say that.
I got a chance to look at the beta and that's what's going on with it.
Anyway, back to the news.
DarkSakura had brought up Flow for the PlayStation 3.
Another game that was being anticipated for the PlayStation 3 was Warhawk.
Well, there was a rumor, and I emphasize rumor going on right now, that Warhawk could actually turn into a PS3 downloadable title instead, just like a Gran Turismo HD.
And I believe they did confirm saying that it was not canceled.
It was not canceled.
Oh, that's good.
It would be interesting if you have all these games that are kind of going down that path.
PlayStation 3 discs have been dumped to ISOs
Making way for a whole new brand of piracy for the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
PlayStation 3 I can see because it's Blu-ray and the system has a hard drive built into it.
So I'm seeing something pretty similar to what happened with the PlayStation 2 happening with the PlayStation 3.
But right now, Kraken Group Paradox has dumped the first ISO.
Not yet playable, but they've still dumped it and it's only a matter of time.
of MotorStorm, the Japanese ISO for that.
And right now they're saying that the first few sectors of the PlayStation 3 image are special and may contain the decryption keys for the executables, but right now they still haven't figured out exactly how to run stuff yet.
On the other front, though, with the Wii, there's actually been a program released to be able to dump that, and I believe it's two freely available programs
to be able to dump those one of course is called DVD Info Pro that's available out there right now and then there's another program that you use once you have that to raw to dump and they'll dump an image of the Wii DVD but of course once again they haven't figured out how to run those yet either but that's half the battle is dumping the disc and the other half is getting it on there and playing it so it's only a matter of time
So how long before we see fully pirated Wii and PS3 games available on the internet?
Probably a few months.
The Wii's kind of tricky because it's really hard to read those discs.
A normal computer can't read them.
I'm not sure about the Blu-ray ROMs for the PS3, but I know that the Wii ones are pretty hard.
So, I don't know.
We'll see.
Hopefully, I don't know.
Sony's protection in the past has been pretty crappy, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see this stuff pretty soon.
Street Fighter 2
Going on there.
And also a game called Super Probotector, which in the U.S.
is Contra 3, which is so unfair because I want Contra 3.
It's an 800 Wii point game.
Good one.
If you want to check it out, let me know how good it pulls over.
I mean, I've been pleased with everything that's come out for virtual console as far as, I mean, they still have Flickr.
I think it's fantastic.
But those are new ones coming out.
Lucky.
I want Super Contra 3
Virtual Console, that's coming out soon at least.
And then I know they were showing... Well, Kid Icarus was on there a while ago.
Mighty Bomb Jack.
Xevious.
Let's see here.
Jewel Quest 2.
I think that's... Xevious was in last week's releases.
Yeah, that's probably a full game, the Jewel Quest 2 thing.
Let's see here.
What about the Nintendo Originals?
Weren't there supposed to be original virtual console things coming out?
Yeah, wasn't there supposed to be online play as well?
Right, it'll come eventually, like eons away from now.
I guess all in good time.
We'll see.
Well, now, another very interesting story going around about the Wii is that, you know, of course, there's always these, I don't know what you'd call them, parental groups that want to prevent anybody from having fun.
WFAA has put out this thing going out that says that, hey, look, the Wii and the PlayStation 3 can get on the Internet.
Therefore, your kids are accessing pornography through the Wii and the PlayStation 3.
Because, you know, how easy is it that you can go on and you can go click-click on, you know, Pornotube or something and go access some pornography?
I'm actually looking at the website here that says, oh my gosh, these games are internet access.
They're gateways to pornography.
They can play WarioWare, Guitar Hero, because that's what I play on PlayStation 3 as well, and pornography.
I love the pornography game.
There's a quote here in this article.
Quote, they're innocent and we want to try and keep them that way.
It's very upsetting something this popular.
A kid game can go that direction so quickly.
Oh, shut up, stupid kid.
And even in this story, in a blog, one child boasted, the first thing I thought of when I downloaded the Wii browser was also porn.
Yeah, I'm sure it was really a child that was blogging about that shit.
Well, if they were under 18, you'd see a 17-year-old would be considered a child.
Look, it's the same damn thing as the computer, right?
Yeah.
If you have a PC in your house, that is also a gateway to porn.
So monitor your kids' Wii and PS3 use just like you do their PC use.
Duh.
How hard is that?
That kind of pisses me off that people are trying to spin this.
It's like, oh my gosh, the Wii has chicks doing it on it.
Well, that's just like saying, you know, oh, eating McDonald's is going to make you fat.
Then the next week later, oh, eating Burger King is going to make you fat.
Then the next week later, oh, Taco Bell is going to make you fat.
They're all gateways to fatness.
You know, well, it's just fucking stupid bitches that need the fucking attention and they...
Every news outlet seems to do this kind of shit too.
Oh my god, it's because they don't have news and they need something to fill space.
That's what it fucking is.
And if there's another device that comes out there that has the internet on it, oh my god, it's a gateway to porn.
You know what, there's fucking goddamn child safety stuff on there.
They even had the update to block the internet before the internet browser was even available.
and the weather too, because my god, there can be some pornography in the weather.
Oh, I remember that one time there was the topless weather girl on the weather channel.
Well, this is something completely different.
They have, the tools are there for the parents to use, and it's just the parents are being stupid.
And that's all it is.
And because, for one, I mean, pulling up porn on the Wii is fucking slow.
I mean, granted, you can do it, but they have the parental controls on there.
Okay, lots of good comments from chat.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, live on this Sunday evening on this topic.
DDRDollarBill says, Fuck, the cell phone is the gateway to the internet, thus it can get on porno sites.
James Patrick says, Well, there's porn sites built for the Wii.
Like, people, you know, kind of catering to that whole thing.
And, um, looking at this, well, let's see.
Um...
Blackboy says there are also programs that restrict what websites can be accessed on the computer, but we don't really see anything like that on the Wii yet.
Yeah, it's called the parental controls.
Does that work on websites too?
It blocks the whole internet.
Oh, okay.
Very interesting.
Also, somebody else said here...
S2H makes this groaner These parents are probably the same types who would let people drink two gallons of water in a short time

My FU of the week goes towards distance.
And knowing that two people that I care an awful lot about are separated by it right now.
I really don't know what else to say.
Just, you know, that I hope they hang in there and can't wait to see them together again.
And I'm talking about Chris and Megzi, so.
The official OLR lesbians will be reunited again soon.
I know they will.
Uh, Loki!
Uh, fuck you to your neighbors, because they're dumb little kids that won't fucking get out of the way of cars.
I mean, I'm sitting there trying to park my car, and they're playing football in the middle of the street, in the dark, by the way.
Um, and they won't fucking move.
So, fuck them, and I'm glad I ran over your fucking toy last week, stupid bitches, and I will run you over if you get in my car's way again.
Jvmon in chat's yelling, please tell me Loki ran someone over, please tell me.
Hey, I started with a toy truck, so, uh... It's just the enabler.
Alright, uh, my FU of the week goes to, uh, my office chair, which is now sitting in the corner of the room, broken, because it snapped in two places when my fat ass plopped in it the other day.
Nelly pointed out, though, it's quite funny, because it is now the hoopty chair, because you can sit in, and fuckin' just like, feel, yeah.
You can kinda lean back, cause there's not, yeah, one of the arms is off
But a big thank you to Duct Tape, which I think will fix my chair soon.
Although, DarkSakura did say I could probably get a new one pretty cheap at Ikea, and it would look better than Duct Tape.
And I do love me some Ikea.
I need an excuse to go there.
Ikea is rad.
I recommend, though, Duct Tape might fix DarkSakura's chair.
Lots of Duct Tape.
I've tried to fix this chair with Duct Tape.
We should just cover the whole chair in Duct Tape.
No, because I don't want to be squeaky.
Maybe I'll get another chair soon, but that seems funny.
It sounds like a fart.
Oh, and F you to dental bills.
Oh, God.
I hate when I go to the dentist, I feel like I'm going to a used car salesman.
They're trying to talk me into, like, all this crap I don't need.
And it's like, you know, like, if I don't do it, then, um, frickin', my teeth are all gonna fall out.
And I know that's not true.
They're trying... Give this.
My dentist is trying to get me to upgrade to a $1,000 crown.
A crown that costs $1,000.
Because they say my insurance will only cover a tin can.
Um, I have a $1,000 crown.
But I...
But how much... Did you pay for all of that out of pocket?
Paid $500 of it.
See, my insurance won't pay for any of it.
Sucks.
The whole reason I have the one I did is because it was absolute necessity because it was my back molar that broke.
The root broke.
And I had to have the whole thing filled out.
No, no, no.
That's not my situation.
See, don't feel bad about having the 10-1 when it could be a little lot worse.
Yeah, exactly.
Anyway...
and I'll see you next time.
I need to eat twice the amount of animals to make up for the vegetarians.
Anyways.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
HD DVD sounds like the way it's going to go, at least for the porn industry.
So if you have a 360, there you go, some porn.
Although I do recommend, though, if you are going to watch porn on the PS3, just dump it to your hard drive.
You know what, though?
I've got to be honest.
If they do go to HD DVD, which it sounds like they're going to do, this is it.
It's over.
Format Wars are over.
That's what ended VHS and beta, when porn went to VHS.
I don't know.
I think, though, they make a good point that if it's cheaper to produce, then the disc prices are going to be cheaper.
But right now, the retail for disc prices isn't any cheaper than Blu-ray.
So it comes down to the bottom line of price, what it's going to cost these companies and what kind of a margin they can make on this stuff because it's cheaper to produce for.
If it's going to be the same quality...
Then, yeah, I think HD DVD is going to win out.
This is why I'm simply saying the format wars are over.
I don't mean to keep dogging on Sony, but look, the evident... Look, when the porn industry, and, you know, who doesn't love some porn?
When they go for HD DVD, that's it.
Well, Sony's really kind of known for failed formats anyways.
I mean, let's see here, Betamax, UMD... Kick them while they're down, Loki.
Kick them while they're down.
I mean, hey, you know, I support Sony just as much, but... It's there.
Moving on.
In New York State, Representative Keith Wright proposed legislation to block the sales of games that depict racist and religious violence to minors.
The bill is A00547, and if it passed, it will block the sales of those games that advocate or glamorize violent crime, suicide, sexual violence, violent racism, religious violence, and illegal use of drugs or alcohol.
He's also called for retailers to play such games in an adults only section.
Retailers would be required to check IDs for buyers under 30.
Again, the problem I have with this, who checks what games meet this criteria?
What is considered violent?
That's why we have the ESRB.
I understand that, but I don't like it when I see these bills and they're so vague on
We want to put violent games behind a closed curtain.
Well, what's a violent game?
Well, this one actually has been going a bit more to define it, to define the violence at any rate.
However, racism is... I mean, basically anybody can get offended over something if it remotely sounds racist to them, so I don't see how it's, you know... And it works both ways, too.
I mean, it...
I think that, honestly, again, it's not the place of our government to decide what gets sold to who.
I think it's the job of the parents to take a more active role in what their children are playing.
Talk to them, look in every so often, but in the end, it's not the place of our government to decide.
We already have rating systems.
Most retailers already...
We can't sell anything that's rated M to a minor, so why is this necessary?
All this is is wasting more taxpayer money.
If we hadn't done the FUs previously.
Alright, anyway, moving on.
I want to talk a little bit about PC gaming.
Remember, one of our New Year's resolutions was we were going to give some more love to PC gaming, and well,
Technically, this is about Mac gaming, but that's okay.
You know, PC is personal computer.
It's everything.
So, some Mac fans are going to be in luck because it sounds like GameTap is planning to port Myst Online over to the Mac.
And also, Myst Online is going to be getting a whole new world to explore.
It's kind of weird, though, because GameTap is actually not available on the Mac.
And a lot of people say that's what's stopping them from getting on GameTap.
And, you know, if GameTap could bring their pretty big library over to the Mac, that would be something else.
Well, Trans Gaming is going to be the company that's actually going to bring the title over to the Mac.
So, that's kind of cool.
No release as of yet.
It's just announced that it's happening.
But those folks who were looking into getting into Myst Online, there you have it.
You can do that on the Mac if you are so inclined.
There you go.
One cool game that's going to be coming to the PC, Monster Hunter.
Not a real huge franchise in the United States, but it is pretty big over in Japan.
This
I like to see that.
or even a PlayStation 2 release of the ones that they have in Japan.
It was on the PS2 a while back, I think.
I'm not sure in the United States, but I know it was in Japan.
They've had a few in Japan.
I don't know.
I think there was the one on PS2 because I remember seeing it at Dan's old store.
Well, at any rate, as far as other games, there's a
The Battlefield 2142 Northern Strike for the PC being worked on right now.
EA has announced it.
It's a booster pack being worked on by EA Digital Illusions Studio in Stockholm.
Wow, it's Swedish.
And it's scheduled for release in March 2007.
It's going to be a futuristic conflict game.
that's following a second Ice Age.
They've released more details on the story, but it's also going to include three new maps, the World War II battle scene at the bridge of Remagen, Alpine, Titan, and a liberation at Leipzig.
So it seems like it's got some stuff going on.
Although it seems to me most people prefer Battlefield 2 to Battlefield 2142.
I played like yay much of Battlefield 2 and decided it wasn't my kind of game, but have you played a little more of this, Loki?
Nope.
Oh, I thought you had for some reason.
Oh, I had it for free, and I don't try to play too much PC stuff.
In fact, the last PC game I played was Oblivion.
I loaded it on there, and...
My laptop barely runs it.
It doesn't really like it too much.
But I played with a lot of cheat devices running at the same time, so I have my super-powered character.
So it was fun going around and killing people from long distances away, unlocking spells that were just in there for test purposes, and just plainly exerting my force over the citizens of a town.
That's what I like.
Why aren't you playing more PC games?
I need to play more Fable.
That's not really a PC game, though.
Why aren't you playing more PC games?
because my PC's old and because also I just don't have the time for it.
I mean, I just don't have the time for it.
You know, wife doesn't like playing games.
Well, maybe there'd be a PC game she likes.
Desperate Housewives of the Game came out, didn't it?
Should buy that for her.
See if the wife likes that.
No, but that reminds me, though, I should probably load up The Sims 2 again so I can kill more Sims.
Oh, and maybe get Sims 2 Pets so I can kill animals, too.
Alright, well, um... I wonder if you should... Too bad you can't make them drink lots of water.
Stop it.
Moving back to the console world.
You know, folks that have 360s that are on their last legs don't really want to have to send that back if they cannot help it.
Kotaku ran an interesting story earlier this week about an old...
DarkSakura.com
Instead of using a heat gun, you're using the heat coming off the CPU because you're wrapping it up in the towels.
It's not a good idea.
Just put it that way.
It's not a good idea to do it.
Why?
Because before the thought was that they were overheating because the contact between the heat sink and the actual processor, whatever they put in there, wasn't fully melted all the way.
And so using the heat gun, you would melt that so it would have a better contact with the heat sink and it would cause it to not overheat.
Well, by wrapping this whole thing in a towel, you may be, you know, duplicating that, but at the same time, you're overheating everything else and causing stuff to break.
So, in a sense, I guess, if you have the Three Rings of Death already, you might as well give it a shot because it's not going to hurt nothing, but, I mean... Not going to help it either.
It's not going to probably help it either.
Well, JeremyTaw1 says, on the IGM message board, someone tried the towel trick and they said it actually worked.
ActDeft says, hey, I got the Three Rings of Death.
Just hit your 360.
It really works.
And, um...
Just give your 360 a lot of water.
Submerge it.
Topic change, please.
Submerge it into the ocean.
Topic change, please.
Anyway, speaking of funny, crazy stuff, let's talk about our friend Ken Kutaragi.
Crayon Man!
In 2006, he had a lot of crazy things to say.
All the more reason, I think, that, you know, we should really get him to stop talking.
But...
There is actually a website that compiled a pretty interesting list of his quotes, PS3 Today.
And so we thought we would share some of them with you and maybe have some discussion about how crazy he is.
First off, the PlayStation 3 is not a game machine.
That was a quote from him.
So, not a game machine.
I guess it's a computer.
Anyways...
Being us for a short moment is like accidentally winning a point from a sheer hand, Karate Master, and Microsoft is still not a black belt.
Just like with their operating systems, they might come out with something good around the third generation of their release.
So, I don't get that.
That doesn't make any sense.
Let's see here.
Oh, this one's kind of funny.
Microsoft shoots for the moon.
Did you just say Microsoft?
We're all having talking problems.
See, I can't even talk.
We're all having talking problems.
It's in the water in this town.
The water not only is killing people, but it's making people stupid.
Anyways, Microsoft shoots for the moon, Sony shoots for the sun.
Okay.
It says, this time Microsoft has stated clearly that it's going after the PlayStation.
However, they're going after the, not after the PlayStation 3, but the PlayStation 2.
They were looking at 2, and that's why Xbox 360 became like that.
So it's like, because it's the second console from them, they're going after the second console from Sony?
Yeah, no, that doesn't make any sense either.
With PlayStation, or the PlayStation 3, our intentions have been to create a machine with supercomputer calculation capabilities for home entertainment.
Okay.
All right.
PlayStation 3 will instill discipline in our children and adults alike.
Everyone will know discipline.
DarkSakura's website of the week.
She serves the internet up and down and left and right and back and forth and...
All over the place.
In fact, I hear there's 13 different ways she can hold her internet, including the mortar and pestle.
And she finds a website that she likes and shares it all with you here on our program.
It's called DarkSakura's Website of the Week.
See?
It's something in the water.
I don't drink the water, though.
I had coffee.
Coffee is made of water, stupid.
I didn't use tap water, though.
I used filtered water.
I filter all the stupid out of it.
Whatever.
Anyway, the website of the week is YouParkLikeAnAsshole.com Best site ever.
This site actually has downloadable stickers.
Or not stickers, but...
Notices that you can leave on people's cars, like in Fraction 1 and Fraction 2.
They're available in a PDF format.
And you can leave them on cars that you see parked badly.
As in double parking, being too close to the line to where no one can get out of the car next to them.
And the best thing about that is that it has check marks that you can put on there to say, like, listed two spots, one car, a little too close, too far away from the driveway.
Too close to my driveway, over the painted lines, diagonal parking, cool car, diagonal parking, not so cool car, move up, that's a compact, and others so that you can walk it in.
And there's a disclaimer that says, parking is far too limited in our overcrowded streets and parking lots, and you happen to park like an asshole.
Go to the above website to see why someone else thought you parked like an asshole.
Don't be too offended, we all do it at one time or another, it just so happens that you got caught.
Dude, Jamie, I'll give you a quarter to leave one on extra first car.
Dude, I'd do it for free.
What was I going to say?
And you can also send pictures to the site, too.
They need the one that's like four corners.
It's where you park in four spaces at once, you know, like just down the center of the crossing.
I'm going to go to the site.
Look, I have a little printer right here, a little cheap-ass $30 printer.
I'm going to go to the site.
First thing, when I can, when this show's done, I'm going to print some out and carry them around in my car, and I'll let you know how many I use.
Actually, yesterday, when I was getting sushi, there were these people who were just parked... I mean, really freaking parked badly.
Like, the line was in the middle of both of their cars, yeah?
Well, how about they need one on there that says, this is not a parking spot, you know?
It's, like, in the middle of the road, or, like, double parked, or just wherever.
Well, also, you can...
Well, this is what I did.
I actually just hand wrote notes and left diagrams pointing the proper way to park.
And the first one says, you park like an idiot.
You learn how to do this when you're a teenager.
Don't do it again.
And the other one was, you park like you're retarded.
Get back on the short bus.
What if the person really was mentally challenged?
Then they don't need to be driving.
But this person was triple parked.
I kid you not.
Not even for legitimate reasons.
It was at a restaurant.
Real quick here, I got one more Ken Kutaragi quote.
I missed this one.
It says, if processors of high performance and wide bandwidth like the cell were linked together without sufficient security, a worldwide system crash could occur with one attack.
Is there a site called YouTalkLikeAnAsshole.com?
I don't know.
Speaking of assholes, here's one in training.
Apparently a nine-year-old child stole their neighbor's car.
got spotted by police on the interstate, guns it to a 90-mile-an-hour chase.
The kid tried to take an exit ramp, but the engine blew and the car hit a curb, went into a tree, and the kid gets captured.
How the hell did a 9-year-old learn to drive a car?
I had to do so many loops in the parking lot at my high school with the driver's ed instructor before I was ever able to figure out how to drive.
Same way I did.
Ridge Racer!
Well, yeah, you're not helping much because apparently, according to what was going on, is that the mom believed that PlayStation taught him how to do all this.
So apparently either Grand Theft Auto or Ridge Racer, this is where he learned to drive and do all this and hightail it to get away from the cops.
You're not helping, DarkSakura.
Well, did you see the other part of this?
But they don't have accurate driving simulators.
I think it was arcade games that did it.
It's all Gran Turismo's fault.
Did you see the real driving simulator?
Anyways, did you see the rest of the story where they were talking about how he, before that, also recently evaded airport security, managing the hop-up flight?
No, they're trying to turn it into Chuck Norris.
Come on.
Oh, that'd be funny, Chris.
See, that'd be cool if he actually did that, because, you know, I'd give props to the kid, but, um... Yeah, I think, though, seriously... Props to the kid?
That's my tax dollars paying to bust his ass.
Fuck that.
Put him in juvie.
No, props to the kid, because the parents should get, you know, fucking billed or something for this shit.
I absolutely agree the parents should be billed for it all.
My tax dollars should not go to pay for this stupid kid.
Don't let little Billy in the goddamn car.
It's a gateway to porn.
He can drive to a porno show.
Where did he learn to steal a car?
In a video game, you press X to steal the car.
You did not go through the whole process.
He didn't steal a car.
Here's what happened.
Little fucking mommy went into the store.
Billy, stay in the car.
I'm going to leave it running.
Got in the driver's seat and drove off.
That's what happened.
It said it was the neighbor's car.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Apparently there's been some screenshots where pedestrians have been spotted.
I can only hope that that were the case, but unfortunately I'm thinking this is from some sort of cutscene in the game.
But if there's pedestrians and I can hit them going 200 miles an hour, that sold the game twice to me right there.
Seriously.
Me too.
I'm like, seriously, if there's actually pedestrians on the road that run away from your car and stuff, oh my god, did I just buy this game like three times.
I'm all, because...
Burnout is so hot to begin with.
It's one of my favorite racers.
It really is awesome.
Except for the soundtracks.
That's why I love 360.
You can just change out the soundtrack.
Oh, man.
I want an adult-only game where I can blow these people.
I want to see blood splatters and skull fragments shattering into my window.
That'd be awesome.
You know, seriously, I think if, you know, especially with Rockstar and the next Grand Theft Auto game, hell, just go adult only and just fucking go crazy.
Go fucking nuts.
Just have a normal, like, do like movies.
You know, have a rated version of the game and have the underrated.
You know, that way you can still sell as many copies and, you know, some people will buy the underrated where you can fucking blow people up and have skull fragments, you know, slam into your car.
It'd be cool, though, if the skull fragments could impale other people and embed in their skulls and kill them.
Yeah.
That'd be fantastic.
Anyway.
You guys are morbid.
I am not!
I would love to read some chat comments right now, but I just totally got booted from chat.
I pinged out, so... I'll read chat comments!
Thank you, is there anything interesting?
DarkSakura is awesome.
Real ones, please.
They're just saying a yay burnout.
and Red Asphalt, someone said.
Ouch.
But moving on to the next story, speaking of fun violence, we have Calling All Cars, formerly known as Criminal Crackdown, which is supposed to be a mix of stuff like Bomberman and Twisted Metal and Demolition Derby.
with explosions and crashes and criminals and crashes and more crashes and more crashes.
It kind of looks like Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2.
I know.
It has that same sort of... Well, it's more of a diagonally overhead view, I think.
But Sony Computer Entertainment is saying that it would be out by March.
So let's hope so.
That looks kind of fun to me.
I love exploding stuff.
I love the description here.
It says Tom and Jerry type violence with mass destruction.
Hmm.
Sounds interesting.
All right.
Well, we're going to take your calls pretty soon on our Skype line, which is 1-877-GAME-OLR, or the username is Skype.
But one other thing that that phone line can be used for is to leave voicemails when we're not here.
And we like to play some of our favorite voicemails on the air when you...
We like to play some of our favorite voicemails on the air when we're not able to take your calls live.
And we're going to play some of those voicemails right now.
We've got some really good ones from the last couple shows.
So here's our first voicemail.
This one's about two minutes.
Hi, this is Razorburn2021.
I wanted to make some comments on last week's show.
I just got done with my weekly listen and...
Paradox Vincent's call about Wii Sports kind of got me thinking about a problem I've been having for the last couple of gens with Nintendo product.
It's one of the things that's kind of held me back from really getting into, and it's kind of a Nintendo fanaticism.
Guys like Paradox Vincent, you know, if you can't look at a game like Wii Sports, I mean, like,
I'm huge.
I've really, really enjoyed Gears of War, but I can look at it and see why there are people that won't like it.
I can see why people would see it's boring or that it just doesn't have the flair they're looking for.
If you can't look at Wii Sports and see why a critic would bash it, I think you've really kind of let yourself get a little too into Nintendo.
There's this feeling out there that Nintendo can do no wrong, and I think Graybush, when you had your interview, touched on a little bit that
Most systems have fans that are way, way, way harder on their games than Nintendo because I think right now Wii fanatics are kind of really thirsty for every game to be, specifically the Nintendo titles, to be a huge success.
I've heard stories from most podcasts I listen to about, well, over the holidays I took it and my grandma wanted to play Wii Sports.
I've heard that a lot, but how many of your grandmas really are going out and buying a Wii?
You know, you say, well, Grandma came over and she wanted to talk to me about Wii Bowling.
I mean, how many grandmas are sitting around the hair parlor and saying, well, Edith, last week I played Wii Bowling.
Gaming has come a long way, but I don't think it's come a long way.
Sure, your grandpa will play Wii Sports with you, but I don't think, you know, he was a nom.
He's not going to sit down and play Elements.
I think that what you need to be able to see both sides of an argument to really be a gamer.
And I think if you're really looking at
I'm being kind of rambly now, and now my call's gone too long, so I'm just going to let you go.
Love you.
Well, thank you very much for the voicemail.
We appreciate it.
You know, it's kind of interesting.
I'm kind of trying to think back to the show when that was taped and kind of everything that we said that was going on there.
And, you know, I think, you know, I don't think it's necessarily that Nintendo can do no wrong.
Because certainly, you know, at least us here in studio pointed out many faults that Nintendo's done.
And, you know, we were just making fun of Red Steel earlier.
Although, granted, that's a third-party title.
But, you know, most people would say, hey, it's a mistake.
Nintendo's not online right now.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hey guys, this is Mr. Wonderful from the forums.
I just wanted to chime in with what Sky was saying on the most recent show about gaming journalism being in for a rude awakening.
I couldn't agree more.
I'm a gaming journalist myself, and for too long the gaming journalism community has really just been focusing on what they perceive to be hardcore and trying to tell the community about what's new and hardcore and underground, but they're a mainstream publication.
They need to appeal to all walks of life.
They need to appeal to the gaming public as a whole, not just niches.
So I think that the Wii is going to provide a huge awakening.
It's going to provide a revolution, if you will, of this community.
Because journalists can't just say, you know, Gears of War is the greatest game ever because, you know, Cliffy B made it and all this.
There's a lot of new gamers out there who don't know who Cliffy B is and probably don't care.
They're going to have to start covering a wider range of topics and they're going to have to start backing up claims.
I think we're going to see a new...
A new age of gaming magazines.
They can't just keep continuing on the path they're on.
This huge audience that Nintendo's got is not going to be buying their magazines if they don't understand a damn word of them.
So, yeah, I agree pretty much wholeheartedly with what you're saying.
It's going to be an interesting time for journalism as well as gaming, and I can't wait to see where it goes.
But if somebody doesn't pick up on this trend that there's non-gamers that are gaming now,
then I don't think they're going to get into it whereas if there is a magazine out there that caters to this idea that people who haven't played games and don't know as much about the history or the culture of gaming and you know, kind of a my first gaming magazine if you will I think something like that could have huge success so I'd really like to see something like that happen great show and keep up the great work looking forward to the next one take it easy guys
Thank you very much for the voicemail, we appreciate it
because people usually buy magazines for their hobbies and the things they're really into so I don't know if necessarily a casual gaming magazine would sell but I kind of go back to something I had referenced on a particular show where I said magazines like Entertainment Weekly and so on need to expand on their gaming sections and magazines that are dedicated to entertainment and those types of things in general should look at these things from a casual game perspective.
That was my thought.
Anything else you guys want to add?
DJ Morpheus in chat says, why doesn't OLR play hate voicemails?
Because everyone loves us.
We don't get hate voicemails.
Start sending them in.
Yeah, call and leave us some.
I don't know.
No, we're not going to
We'd listen to them and get a chuckle out of it and then we'd delete it.
Let's see.
James Patrick has a good comment.
Saying Nintendo fans are crazy is stupid.
Madden fans.
GTA fans.
A lot of fans are just as bad.
Interesting.
Interesting.
Alright, well, oh, this is interesting.
SSJ100Matt has an interesting comment.
Some Nintendo fanboys are getting as bad as Scientologists.
When someone says something bad about it, they go on the offensive, like the Zelda 8.8 rating.
I agree, people got their panties way too ruffled over that one.
I mean, people in general should just realize it's just some dude's opinion who happens to work for a big website that all you people visit.
I don't know why, but you do, and you apparently listen to what they have to say, but in the end, it's just one dude's opinion.
Right?
That's how you look around.
What makes these people any more qualified than you, you, or me?
Huh?
I mean, I realize they went to journalism school, they know how to write, and they have a love of games, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and all that stuff.
Great.
But, you know, I have a love of games.
You that listened and downloaded this video game podcast has a love of games.
Okay, so these guys know their spelling and their grammar and how to write a good review.
That's about it.
It doesn't always mean... I mean, I don't think, to be honest, a lot of these people have gone to journalism school.
I think they're just being hired, so... I could almost... In fact, I know for a fact not all of them have.
I know that for a fact.
Oh, well.
That's what we got.
Any more news?
Yes, we definitely have some new stuff.
So, this was pretty exciting.
All week long, they've been kind of...
Ghostbusters Zootfly
and right now on top of the Ghostbusters game Zoop Fly is also working on another game called Time Zero and it's basically it's kind of related to Ghostbusters a little bit talks about two adventurers who are diehard New Yorkers and they get trapped in a deep like the shadow world of a parallel New York and the city itself is actually a war machine threatening to wipe out the world and they have three days to stop it so
That's kind of neat.
They're working on that.
And I know they're also working on another game called Toy Wars, which is coming to the Xbox Live Arcade, which looks pretty cool, too.
So hopefully people, you know, so far the response has been pretty good on it.
And a lot of fans want to see this thing made.
So hopefully a publisher jumps on this and gets a license he writes paid for.
And hopefully we see this game come to fruition.
All right.
Well, that sounds pretty cool, and I like that screenshot of the toy game that you showed me, and that's kind of cool.
Yeah.
Is this something you'll probably buy?
It would be.
I like Ghostbusters.
I think it'd be fun.
Will it have the song in it?
That's all I want to know.
Actually, the song is different.
They have a rock version of it in the video that they were showing, so I liked it.
I thought it was pretty cool.
All right, very cool.
Alright, well, this is the point of the show where we're going to open up the Skype line.
If you want to give us a call, our username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, or you can give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, which is toll free in the US and Canada.
Sorry, UK folks and those in other countries, whether it be Australia, wherever you're at, you'll have to use the old-fashioned method of calling us on Skype, which I guess isn't really old-fashioned, but for us it is.
Let's go to the phones.
I'm getting a lot of calls tonight already.
We are the gateway to porn
By the way, I just want to say, before we start getting into this, I want to say, Rob D's quality is like perfect right now.
I'm loving this call because I don't hear myself echoing in the background.
No static.
No static.
His volume is perfect.
This is a model phone call, boys and girls.
I applaud you.
You have a good enunciation.
I do.
I applaud you, Rob D. Not to knock on the other callers because I realize it's internet radio and what have you.
Rob D, whatever you've done to set yourself up, you need to share that with everybody.
It's great.
Sounds great.
All right, so the Wii porn story, what do you want to say?
All right, so basically, I don't know if you actually covered this.
I unfortunately was watching part of the Colts game, so I was kind of halfway listening to OLR.
We forgive you.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Okay, so I don't know if you covered this, but did you read the quote from A Supposed Child where he said,
The first thing I did when I got the Wii was think about porn or something like that.
Yeah, something that the website had got from their blog.
They went and looked at a blog and said, hey, one child said on their blog that the first thing I thought about when I got the Wii was porn.
Or the Wii, no, it was the Wii browser.
First thing I thought about when the Wii browser was porn.
So I was curious about that.
Since it mentioned that it was a blog, I plugged the quote into Google just to see where it was from.
Ah, good thinking, my friend.
Where did it come from?
It's from a post on Haku.
On where?
Haku.
Kotaku.
Really?
It was a comment to some random article.
I forget what it was.
Oh, I thought you were going to say MySpace.
Well, okay, that's interesting because then how would they know that it was a child?
Because Kotaku's commenting system doesn't tell a person their age, right?
Well, here's what's actually funny about this.
The comment immediately preceding that quote was, as a male aged 18 to 35.
And I kid you not, that's exactly what it was.
Huh.
And he is quoted as a child in that article.
Interesting.
So they're totally stretching the facts and stuff.
Not surprising.
I'll find the quote on Google, or I'll find the webpage and shove it in chat just to verify that.
I'm not pulling this out of nowhere.
No, I believe you.
I'm pulling the gross horse in there.
I believe the power of Google is an amazing thing.
But that's kind of funny.
I just thought that how, that the fact that they...
DarkSakura.com
Yeah, and this is almost as good as that one article a year ago about how the PSP pulls porn out of thin air.
Oh, some folks in chat don't know what Kotaku is, so we should say it's a big gaming blog.
If you know Destructoid or even like IGN and GameSpot's news feed, it's very similar.
It's just a game blog.
You can put an RSS in your reader and get all their news and stuff.
That's what Kotaku is.
Sorry, I'm sorry, what was the other thing you were saying?
I was saying it's almost as good as the article from about a year ago when it said that the PSP was...
or no, if the PSP pulled porn out of thin air.
It just made up porn.
Exactly.
Hey, dude, if the PS3 would pull porn out of thin air, I'd buy it.
Only no Blu-ray doesn't.
Yeah, now we do.
It actually reminds me of the story where we had the DS, and remember the one TV news station did a story about child predators on the DS in PictoChat?
That's what it reminds me of.
Too many penis drawings?
No, the fact that, oh my gosh, your four-year-old might be playing on the Nintendo DS and a child predator could write something sexual on it.
But what people forget is that if somebody's doing that, that person is in the room with you.
Those DSs do not have that huge a range.
I don't know.
All right, well, anyway, that's all I have to say.
That's what was going on at E3 a couple years ago.
Well, that's different.
That's E3.
You put all the nerds in a room and that's what's going to happen.
All right, Rob D., we appreciate the call.
I tossed a link in chat, by the way.
What?
What's that?
I tossed a link in chat.
Oh, great.
Thank you.
We'll take a look at that.
Anyway, thanks for taking my call.
See you guys later.
No problem.
Have a good one, buddy.
Thanks for the call.
Model OLR phone call.
Yes, it looks like, of course, since I said that, he did cut out a couple times during the call, but that's just probably our connection.
That's all the people playing fucking World of Warcraft in the other room that's causing that.
That's what's...
That's what's up.
Let's go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
It's everyone's favorite caller, Raven's Dolphin.
Oh, Raven's Dolphin.
What can we do for you this week, buddy?
Absolutely nothing.
I just want to comment on the Wii thing and the PSP thing.
I just have to say this first.
You're becoming quite the famous little caller of Internet radio programs, I'm noticing.
Yeah, I figured that.
You should start your own show.
Not that I'm discouraging you from calling into programs, but it's obvious you have a lot to say.
And if we haven't proven this fact, any schmo with a microphone can do a show.
You should think about it.
I was thinking about it.
I'm definitely thinking about it.
It's just the thing about is money, and can I keep it going for an hour?
You know what?
DJ Morpheus says, how about a show of clips of him just calling into other shows?
That's a brilliant idea.
All right.
I'm just fucking with you, Raven's Dolphin.
What's on your mind, really?
I'm sorry.
I just want to say that I watched that clip with the Wii, you know, when they talk about the Wii for porn.
The two little girls that had the Wii, they took them and I pushed pause and they didn't even have the internet browser.
I don't think they even have internet at all.
Oh, so like you watched the clip, like on the TV site you watched a clip of the girls playing with the Wii and they didn't even have the internet channel on it.
They didn't even have it on.
They went to the news show, like, look, it's a game with the porn.
I don't even think they even have internet.
You know, you have to download it off the Wii, but you have to download it off the Wii Channel.
There's so many different things you have to do.
I don't think people realize that.
Your quality is kind of screwing up there, buddy, but yeah, you know what?
Damn the media for doing that.
They're just looking for something.
Yeah, I just feel like TV's just failing me now.
Well, you know, you always, you have to take some of the things that you hear on the news with a grain of salt, unfortunately, especially these types of investigation stories.
I mean, it's one thing to report on a fire that's, you know, engulfed an entire neighborhood or whatever, and it's another thing to report on these types of moral issues, right?
All right.
I'm hoping to get a live 365 stream soon.
It's just a matter of money.
All right.
Well, good luck to you, Raven Stolfen, and you know, if you get your own show, we got your back.
Oh, thank you.
And I, you know, I have your back too.
All right.
We know.
Have a good one, buddy.
You too.
Bye.
Later.
All right.
Um, let's, oops, did I just hang up on someone else?
Okay, let's go.
Our phone lines are open.
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
You can always call us on Skype.
Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.
Does anybody have any last minute stories real quick?
Uh, interject here in between some calls.
Yeah.
Um, just a couple things real quick.
Um,
Mega Man Star Force is actually getting a pretty cool peripheral for the DS and it's actually some sort of almost like the card scanning system that they had for Animal Crossing and some other stuff before so you can actually plug that in and scan your Mega Man cards to be able to play in the role playing game as well so that's kind of neat and then Eidos has a
Grab the rights for Daffy Duck and The O.C.
So we're going to see some crappy games based on that.
The O.C.?
But The O.C.
canceled.
I don't get it.
All the perfect time to make a game.
We're getting another call real quick.
Let's go to this one.
This is a conference.
I'm a little worried about this one, but I guess we'll pick this up anyway.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, and I'm speaking to two people?
No, I don't know what you're talking about.
My Skype's being glitchy.
Okay, well, what's up, DMN?
What's on your mind?
Not much.
I'm calling to defend WarioWare.
Okay, oh yes, because, well, I didn't give it a negative review.
I said it's fun, but it just, you know, like most WarioWares, I don't see the magic lasting.
Well, like most WarioWares.
There you go, Rob.
It's the same thing.
We all, I think everybody, everybody in your chatroom, everybody who listens to your show, and even including myself, I knew that this game was going to have a lot of shit, but it was going to be three hours long of gameplay.
But it's a great party game.
It is, and I don't disagree with you there.
So what do you want to defend?
Where am I wrong in my assessment of WarioWare?
Just because you're stupid, no.
I have to agree with that, too.
Yeah, I knew it.
I knew there was two people on the line.
Ranma, you're there, too?
All right, wait, wait, wait.
Okay, never mind the fact there's two people on the line right now, whatever, but what's this whole defending WarioWare thing?
I can't tell you why.
Okay.
Ranma, you care to chime in on this whole thing?
No, because I haven't played WarioWare yet, but I can say this because of you guys.
I did buy two new games, Luminous Mobile and Cooking Mama.
Did you hear that, Ranma, about Cooking Mama because of us?
He told me last night.
Oh, my gosh.
Luminous Mobile, you know, it's the only mobile game I think I've ever talked good about on this program.
So it's worth it.
It's a good buy.
I'm paying like $1.99 for it a month, and I'm connected to their servers, like top rankings and stuff like that.
I'm like, eh, no big deal.
But another thing about WarioWare, going back to that, is this shows almost everything that the Wii can do, even more so than Wii Sports did.
Well, but I could rent it and get a lot of that.
You could.
You could.
I think it's worth a buy if you have, like me, I always have people over here.
I don't know if you get that from OLR, but this place has become party central and it's starting to look like it too.
There's people here all the time.
Thusly, WarioWare, Mario Party, those games are excellent buys for me.
And for anybody with a large family or something, I just think for single player people, it's going to wear thin.
Yeah, and it's a whole other show to tell you what I've seen strewn about Rob's place.
Alright, yeah.
But one thing I do want to agree with you on, I do think the $50 price tag for that game is quite steep.
I think maybe if it was released at $29.99, maybe $39.99, that's kind of pushing the envelope, but I don't think $49.99 was a good idea, and I have to... I don't agree with Nintendo on that decision.
Alright, well, that's what it is.
So now I'm going to do something I've always wanted to do on this program, and I'm going to hang up on two people at once.
You suck!
No!
That was fun.
And that would be Pwned with a capital P, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio.
One more call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
It's Legend of Zaku.
Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.
What's on your mind, my friend?
Showing me complete without a call from you.
I know, goddamn.
We were just wondering when you'd get through.
It's the first one of the year, though.
Well, what's up, Zaku?
You know, about the whole Wii debacle about the DJs going too far, not sure, you know, basically f***ing up when they shouldn't, when they should, you know, take diligence.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
What's the point with, I mean, I'm not trying to belittle your call and your opinion is certainly important, but goddamn if I haven't talked about this issue until I've been blue in the face.
Remember, Zaku, I live here.
If you think it's water cooler talk where you are, it's like ten times as much where I am, because, like, everybody thinks they knew her.
Right there, it's a local, one of the local things that's happening around the back of the woods.
And so, I mean, I could say that they're able to face involuntary manslaughter charges just for the fact that if you heard the tapes and all the recordings that were actually saved, you could see on their part that they're just shrugging off people that could have warned them.
And they just, they show no regard.
They said that they had, like, um,
They had them sign a waiver.
I go back to what someone in chat said earlier.
It's not just the DJs.
There were 10 people that went into making this contest.
The DJs just egged it on, but that's their job.
Yeah, the people, basically, not only the DJs, but the people involved in organizing the event.
They'll face justice eventually.
and I think in a civil trial, the entire station is going to pay for it.
I wouldn't doubt, I've got to be honest, Zachu, I wouldn't doubt if that station doesn't go through some radical changes.
I bet you anything, and I'll keep you posted, but I'll bet you that whole station goes down over this.
They change their name or their look or something.
They're going to have to distance themselves from this somewhere.
I mean, when it's showing up on the BBC's website that your little local radio station...
Right.
Right.
In New York.
They call it Z100.
Yeah, Z100, essentially.
Yes, basically, I mean, when you have that, I mean, remember what happened with Opie and Anthony when they pulled that stunt a few years ago?
They got him kicked off a terrestrial radio for the first time?
Yeah, but having sex in a church isn't going to kill someone.
It actually went through a lot of format shifts.
It changed formats throughout the years.
From the time of the incident until now, it just went through, what, a second format change?
So yeah, I mean, they tried their best to distance themselves, and what I see in the future, I hope not, but I mean... Make it quick, Zaku, they want this topic banned in chat.
Final thought.
Just reformat the station, and that's about it.
I mean, they will face justice eventually, so, you know, one of these people will end up paying.
Well, we'll keep you here posted on Orange Lounge Radio.
Unless this continues to have nothing to do with gaming, then we probably won't say anything at all.
Alright.
Alright, have a good one, Zaku.
Alright, see you.
Later.
I don't know how you guys feel about this, but my personal thought is I'm willing to talk about this as long as it has to do with gaming.
If Nintendo is brought into the suit, then it has to do with gaming.
But if it stays the way it is, I don't really want to talk about it anymore.
We've said enough.
Nail in the coffin.
Thank you.
One more call.
Oh, damn, it just went away.
Maybe they'll call back.
Finish up that thought on the last minute story you had real quick.
Oh, yeah.
There's another one that's coming out for the Wii, another game.
That's being put out.
That's actually going to be kind of like a crazy taxi, but with emergency vehicles called Emergency Mayhem.
That's being put out by Codemasters.
Also going to be on the PS2 and the PSP.
That looks kind of fun.
That's it.
That's all I got.
All right, we got our caller again.
Let's go to the phone.
This will be the last one, I promise.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, Shadow Next Gen.
Hi, Shadow Next Gen, what's on your mind, my friend?
How's it going, guys?
Uh, pretty good, you know.
It goes.
It goes.
First of all, since I haven't been able to call in for a while, I want to say I really enjoyed your appearance on AGI.
Thank you.
We've actually been getting quite a few compliments on that.
That's something else.
You know, we like working with Scott and them.
It's fun.
Yeah, although tomorrow's show should be funny if Scott shows up since his Patriot's lost.
Ha ha ha.
You know, I don't really follow football, but I do know he was pretty passionate about the game tonight, so that should be interesting.
But aren't they off all week?
They have a show tomorrow, I believe, and then they're off.
Interesting.
All right.
Well, what's on your mind tonight in regards to gaming?
I was curious about, it was actually a comment, I think it was AGI, I made it a while back.
It was either AGI or you guys, because I listen to both of you a lot.
They were worried about with the Wii's price point, this was back in October or September, about how since Nintendo was supposed to have all of these different consoles, how you would be able to walk into a store and find anyone with no problem.
And therefore, they thought there would be a problem because people would see it as, you know, since it's already there, you know, it wasn't really that good or it wasn't that hot of an item type of thing.
I can't remember if we said that.
I don't think that we would have said that because my kind of viewpoint on it is that
I think, you know, a little bit of demand is a good thing, but this is too much.
This is too much.
This is exactly what Microsoft went through, you know?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I was just kind of curious about what your thoughts were as how people were predicting now what happens, and now the exact opposite has happened where you cannot find a Wii anywhere, but you can almost walk into any store and find a PS3.
Yeah, you know, but I wonder how much, I don't have any sales stats, I don't know, but how much of this is Nintendo making?
I mean, how has production been at the Wii's?
Been pretty low.
Yeah, because what I understand is that we all have this impression that the Wii's are just rolling off the freaking assembly line, but I believe I heard somewhere else that the actual amount of shipments that these places are getting are not weekly.
No, they're not weekly, and I want to say the last shipment we got was in December, the next one we're getting is this week, and
That's how long it's been.
It's been a few weeks since we've gotten anything.
And it's because they're sold out.
They're sold out of that.
They're sold out of DS.
They're sold out of Zelda, the GameCube Zelda.
They're just way behind in everything.
They're too damn popular.
And the thing with the PS3 being in stock is not because they're shipping a ton of units.
It's because they're not selling as many units as they're shipping.
They're just getting shipments every now and then, but they're just not selling them.
It's not the hot item they thought it would be, or at least not yet.
Well, the system's not going to sell very well if there's only 13 games out for it, so that's a problem.
Out of curiosity, are you a Wii or PlayStation 3 owner yourself?
A Wii and a 360.
Ah, so you're a Wii 60 camp.
Any interest in PS3?
Excuse me?
Any interest in PS3?
Maybe down the line.
It will depend on how many more exclusives leave Sony.
He sounds just like me.
Because all I need to hear is basically like a Final Fantasy or a Kingdom Hearts on the 360 and I might be done with Sony.
Yeah, I know.
If Square came out tomorrow and announced Kingdom Hearts 3 for the 360, put a fork in Sony as far as I'm concerned.
But I don't know.
Again, I say that kind of jokingly on here, but I don't know.
Let's not forget that Katamari Damacy was a very excellent
I'll be at third-party exclusive.
Well, I mean, I guess all these games are third-party exclusives.
They went over to Sony.
It was just an awesome game.
And PS2 took a little while to build up some steam.
I didn't buy a PS2 on launch day.
I didn't buy one for a while.
I don't think I bought one until Final Fantasy X came out.
I didn't get one until the slim units came out is when I got my PS2.
Oh, you know what?
I had an import one for the longest time.
That's what it was.
Well, anyhow, anything else you want to share with tonight's program?
Oh, yeah.
I had another question for you guys.
I know it
Probably a little late, but I was wondering if there was any particular game or series in 2006 that you guys wanted to play but didn't get to?
Any particular series or game in 2006 that we wanted to play but didn't get to?
But didn't have the time to get to or whatnot?
Maybe something you're looking forward to, but you just didn't get to it for whatever reasons?
How about games I didn't spend enough time with that I wanted to spend more time with?
Trauma Center.
I actually did play a lot of Trauma Center.
The Final Fantasy games.
I played 12 enough to know that I put in a pretty good chunk of hours.
I went up to the double digits in hours.
I wish I could have spent more time with that and I needed to play Final Fantasy 3 enough.
I never did get Cooking Mama and Jamie won't shut up about it so I know I needed to check that one out.
I'm trying to think what other...
Have any of you guys tried out the Shadow Hearts RPG series?
I've heard of it, and I've heard really good things about it, and I have a friend who's playing it, but I haven't played it myself.
Is that something you think ought to be on my list?
Yeah, yeah, they're excellent games.
Yeah, they have three of them out now.
I don't know how well they sell.
I mean, they sell well enough to where the sequels have been coming out.
But, yeah, I think it's one of them that flies under a lot of people's radar for whatever reason.
Are those on GameCube?
PS2.
PS2?
I am thinking of something else.
I've heard of it.
I've heard of it, too.
I haven't really played it.
I still wanted to play Akami.
Send some info to my email.
I'll check it out.
I'll at least rent it if nothing else.
Okay, and then one quick thought and then I'll clear the line for you guys.
Yep.
Loki, have you heard about the Wii Play pre-orders being sold out with GameStop and EB?
Loki, have you heard about the Wii Play bundles being sold out with GameStop and EB?
Yep.
What do you think of that?
What do I think of that?
Do you know anybody else that's doing pre-orders for that?
Yeah, I know a lot of local mom and pop stores are doing pre-orders because I know we got our allocations and...
We got quite a bit of units allocated to us, so I'm surprised that they're sold out already.
I'm hearing Wii Play's not worth it unless you need the controller.
That's what it is.
Everyone's getting in front of the controller, and it's basically almost like a free game with it.
It's $50, right?
Isn't it $49.99?
I thought it was $39.99.
Is it $39?
No, it's $40.
I'm wrong.
$49.99.
Okay.
Thanks for taking my call, guys.
And like I said, big fan as always.
No problem.
We appreciate the call and the game recommendation.
Have a good one, buddy.
Yeah, talk to you later.
Later.
Yep.
You know, like I said, we have day jobs and all that stuff.
We can't always get around to playing everything, but we try.
Between the three of us, we play an awful lot.
You know, I like to play a lot of types of role-playing games, although somehow I missed that one.
Loki likes to play the shoot and kill the hooker type games, and Jamie likes to play really weird shit.
Do you play weird?
No, you like to play Kingdom Hearts.
Yes, I do.
I was going to say, there's a funny website I read about today, I forgot to mention, TheBigBoxProject.com It's about this guy who needed to, he sent back a console, an Xbox 360 console to the actual, you know, to Microsoft originally, and the problem is they sent it back and it's still busted, so they want to
Now, I guess between the time that he sent the first one and the second one needs to go back, they've changed their policy and they want him to pay Debit Fixed or whatever, so he's like, okay, fine, if that's the case, then I'm gonna send this in the biggest fucking box I can find.
So he's trying to pay for, to get one of those, like, um, rail car crates, like the big giant, you know, rail cars to deliver this thing in, and, um,
It's funny because on the website, if you go to it, it has this little dialogue on here.
It says, how big is your repair center?
And then their technician's like, I don't see how that pertains to the situation, sir, because I'm going to send you my broken Xbox in the biggest damn box you've ever seen.
Will it be filled with little styrofoam pellets?
That's what I want to know.
I can only hope.
I can only imagine it will.
That's like somebody pokes a little hole in the box and suddenly they're under a mountain of styrofoam pellets.
Or just, can you wrap the Xbox in that much bubble wrap?
It should be wrapped in duct tape.
Solid duct tape.
That would be a better use of your money right there is to take the box and wrap the whole box in like, I don't know, two feet of duct tape.
Two feet thick.
And that would be awesome.
Just send it.
DarkSakura.com
Yeah, I'm okay.
Just making sure.
Need a hug?
No, I need food.
Well, food.
Sounds good.
No coffee.
I have to sleep eventually.
Well, food.
To get to the food, we have to get to our final thoughts.
We've got to wrap this thing up.
Thank you guys so much for listening to us.
Let's go around and get the final thoughts.
Loki.
My final thought is I need to play more Resistance.
My final thought is I'm getting my PlayStation 2 back from my friend because I have this urge to play Kingdom Hearts ever since I got back from Disneyland.
Damn Disneyland.
Damn it.
Also, do you know I subscribed a video podcast this week to talk about Disneyland?
And, uh, yeah.
That's pretty sad.
I'm turning into Jamie.
Jamie, your final thought.
You need some gas, X?
No.
You don't have anything else to say?
You don't have a certain phrase you say every week on the show?
Kiss my ass!
You're not gonna say, uh,
to reject.
Kiss my ass.
All right.
Fine.
I'm just checking.
I want to make sure that's the official final thought.
All right.
Bend over.
All right.
