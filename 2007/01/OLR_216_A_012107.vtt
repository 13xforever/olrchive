WEBVTT

00:14.246 --> 00:24.845
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, January 21st, 2007, more Final Fantasy XIII details emerge, new developments for the Guitar Hero series including Drum Villain, and can you fix a broken 360 with towels?

00:32.995 --> 00:36.336
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.396 --> 00:40.457
[SPEAKER_02]: I say welcome back because, you know, we missed a show last week, but we'll get into that in a moment.

00:40.517 --> 00:41.717
[SPEAKER_02]: First, let's introduce ourselves.

00:42.097 --> 00:47.639
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know about, video game culture and the video game lifestyle.

00:48.059 --> 00:49.099
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:49.239 --> 00:52.420
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:52.820 --> 00:53.500
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo, what up?

00:53.700 --> 00:54.481
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, Ms.

00:54.521 --> 00:54.861
[SPEAKER_02]: Summers?

00:55.481 --> 00:55.581
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

00:56.804 --> 00:58.106
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm alive, sort of.

00:58.327 --> 00:59.309
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good, that's good.

00:59.609 --> 01:02.794
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a very good time last week on our weekend off with you.

01:02.815 --> 01:03.916
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great time.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.402
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself and DarkSakura and the OLR lesbians all went to Disneyland.

01:07.703 --> 01:08.324
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good time.

01:09.085 --> 01:10.267
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a very...

01:11.795 --> 01:12.455
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting time.

01:12.615 --> 01:17.898
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know some listeners sometimes give Jamie a hard time because she talks about Disneyland a lot on this show, and I'm one of them.

01:18.098 --> 01:20.940
[SPEAKER_02]: I give her a hard time talking about Disneyland so much on this program.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.761
[SPEAKER_02]: But I kind of get it now.

01:22.841 --> 01:26.263
[SPEAKER_02]: I really had a great time, and it really is something else.

01:26.343 --> 01:28.084
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Mountain four times.

01:28.324 --> 01:30.205
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocking Space Mountain four times in a row was awesome.

01:30.585 --> 01:31.606
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just really cool.

01:32.685 --> 01:35.026
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that, you know, we have day jobs.

01:35.086 --> 01:36.587
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR is not what we do for a living.

01:36.627 --> 01:40.769
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's just kind of nice to have a week off to go have nothing but fun.

01:40.809 --> 01:44.230
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what Disneyland was really all about, was just fun and good friends and good times.

01:44.310 --> 01:45.151
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was great.

01:45.171 --> 01:45.811
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a really good time.

01:46.131 --> 01:46.871
[SPEAKER_02]: So group hug.

01:47.672 --> 01:47.912
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:48.212 --> 01:50.513
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, also joining us tonight, say hello to Loki.

01:50.793 --> 01:50.893
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

01:50.913 --> 01:52.314
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, Loki?

01:52.334 --> 01:53.014
[SPEAKER_01]: How was your week off?

01:53.955 --> 01:54.375
[SPEAKER_01]: It was okay.

01:54.855 --> 02:01.458
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to a friend's reception and we hung out there and...

02:01.957 --> 02:03.958
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:30.895 --> 02:32.456
[SPEAKER_02]: What made you... But you quit again.

02:32.556 --> 02:33.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I quit again.

02:33.657 --> 02:36.578
[SPEAKER_02]: So what made you decide to start playing Final Fantasy XI and then quit again?

02:36.638 --> 02:43.841
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I missed it, and then when I came back, I played it, and then I didn't miss it anymore, so it was time to cancel.

02:43.901 --> 02:45.922
[SPEAKER_02]: What made you decide you did the right thing by quitting?

02:46.863 --> 02:48.163
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean, what made me decide?

02:48.383 --> 02:55.647
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because you said you went back for two weeks, and then you quit, so obviously you must have come to the conclusion during those two weeks that, oh, I made the right decision quitting.

02:55.667 --> 02:55.767
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

02:56.562 --> 03:12.898
[SPEAKER_03]: because being a blue mage is freaking boring trying to get those spells and when you spend two hours hunting this one monster trying to get one spell off of it you realize that your time could be better spent somewhere else like looking for a party alright

03:13.543 --> 03:16.505
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the chat room comments here at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

03:16.525 --> 03:19.747
[SPEAKER_02]: We always invite the chatters to always be another guest here on the program.

03:20.247 --> 03:21.408
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have their comments.

03:21.528 --> 03:23.209
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some really good voicemails this week, by the way.

03:23.229 --> 03:27.272
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get to later on in Part B. And just another way we encourage you guys to interact with us.

03:28.292 --> 03:32.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadowslayer says, just sat around and talked equals strippers.

03:32.595 --> 03:33.035
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this true?

03:33.055 --> 03:36.217
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's in his mom's coffee shop.

03:36.857 --> 03:39.879
[SPEAKER_01]: So sitting around and talking is literally sitting around and talking.

03:40.099 --> 03:41.660
[SPEAKER_01]: Lattes and strippers, good times.

03:42.421 --> 03:42.781
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish.

03:42.801 --> 03:42.961
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish.

03:44.292 --> 03:48.276
[SPEAKER_03]: Nellie and I were hoping for strippers with fireworks and jetpacks.

03:48.716 --> 03:53.400
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually almost got somebody to believe that that was going to happen, but they were an idiot, so it doesn't matter.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.883
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be Kat, and she was an idiot.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.146
[SPEAKER_01]: Does Kat listen to this program?

03:59.166 --> 04:00.046
[SPEAKER_01]: Can she defend herself?

04:00.207 --> 04:02.008
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think she knows how to operate a computer.

04:03.309 --> 04:04.470
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a complete idiot.

04:04.811 --> 04:05.051
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

04:05.989 --> 04:11.432
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, welcome back, of course, to all of our live listeners and our podcast listeners since there was no program last week.

04:11.492 --> 04:25.200
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we apologize for not being here, but now that the holidays are over and we're all back into our daily routine, unfortunately, we're kind of in a situation where Jamie's doing school in the early evenings and Loki has to go to bed early for his job, which takes out the late evenings.

04:25.561 --> 04:28.282
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very hard for us to prerecord when we're not here on Sundays.

04:28.342 --> 04:29.803
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry about that, but that's what happened.

04:30.583 --> 04:37.612
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were here listening live, though, Travis Donovan from our Saturday night program on Orange Lounge Radio did a real fantastic little tribute program.

04:38.172 --> 04:47.164
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you listen to one of our buddy podcasts, All Games Interactive, DarkSakura and I appeared on the Friday edition, and it was something else.

04:49.494 --> 04:50.155
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good time, though.

05:13.857 --> 05:22.457
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good time, I had a really good time Thanks to Scott for having us on It's good, I like doing radio with Scott Because he plays such different types of games than we do

05:23.254 --> 05:24.515
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

05:52.654 --> 05:53.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

06:24.493 --> 06:27.834
[SPEAKER_02]: Astro Blasters is one of the best video games I've ever played in my life.

06:27.894 --> 06:28.995
[SPEAKER_02]: That was some good times.

06:29.235 --> 06:32.256
[SPEAKER_05]: And we might be getting another pinball machine that you would be interested in.

06:33.316 --> 06:33.676
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

06:33.996 --> 06:34.636
[SPEAKER_05]: Bride of Pinbot.

06:35.156 --> 06:35.697
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

06:36.577 --> 06:36.957
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

06:36.977 --> 06:37.997
[SPEAKER_05]: I told Dan to try to get it for me.

06:38.658 --> 06:39.878
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of console stuff otherwise?

06:40.318 --> 06:40.798
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

06:40.818 --> 06:46.140
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost got rid of PSU and then went, meh.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.641
[SPEAKER_05]: I turned on Guild Wars and then said, meh.

06:53.798 --> 06:57.460
[SPEAKER_02]: Just when it went through the whole booting and patching and that whole process, you were like, eh, nah.

06:57.900 --> 06:58.500
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much.

06:59.661 --> 07:00.041
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

07:00.281 --> 07:00.861
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, good times.

07:01.602 --> 07:02.702
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

07:03.263 --> 07:04.043
[SPEAKER_01]: My gaming week was good.

07:04.143 --> 07:22.491
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a gaming party last night, actually, and Rob was there, and he can attest to the fact WarioWare Smooth Moves is fun, but playing it with 11 people at the same time is crazy, and it adds a whole new element of fun into it that

07:24.047 --> 07:30.670
[SPEAKER_02]: I have never had a video gaming experience quite like 11-player WarioWare.

07:31.791 --> 07:33.052
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to describe it.

07:33.112 --> 07:33.672
[SPEAKER_02]: It was insanity.

07:34.132 --> 07:38.134
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you guys know, in WarioWare, you only get to use one baton.

07:38.995 --> 07:40.816
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it the baton in the game, but it's Wiimote.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.708
[SPEAKER_02]: You only get to use one Wiimote in multiplayer.

07:44.029 --> 07:46.550
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of the... And you might say, no, that's stupid.

07:46.590 --> 07:47.691
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't they make it four?

07:48.011 --> 07:51.593
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the fun of it was actually passing off the baton in time to other people.

07:51.613 --> 07:52.613
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually kind of funny.

07:53.034 --> 07:54.394
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the whole thing is ridiculous.

07:54.434 --> 07:57.736
[SPEAKER_01]: They have your Miis flying around like this angel form.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.758
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, it really looks weird.

08:00.918 --> 08:07.562
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have all these weird Miifaces with this angel body thing that doesn't even fit.

08:07.622 --> 08:08.222
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have

08:08.883 --> 08:12.226
[SPEAKER_01]: These games that you're playing keeps getting faster, and everyone was just cracking up.

08:12.286 --> 08:13.467
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a lot of fun.

08:13.787 --> 08:16.589
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you notice how OLR totally dominated the multiplayer games?

08:16.609 --> 08:20.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you won one, Miklatov won one, Extrofer won one, and I won one.

08:20.912 --> 08:21.673
[SPEAKER_02]: We played it four times.

08:21.793 --> 08:22.914
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we play games more than that.

08:22.934 --> 08:23.234
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know.

08:23.254 --> 08:23.634
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

08:24.755 --> 08:25.316
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did that.

08:25.356 --> 08:26.336
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really fun.

08:26.717 --> 08:30.820
[SPEAKER_02]: But that just goes to say, at this gamer party, you had some, would you say, casual gamers there?

08:30.860 --> 08:34.843
[SPEAKER_02]: What were the level of people like Tiffany and Heather and the other Rob...

08:35.363 --> 08:36.623
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:00.494 --> 09:01.074
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's funny.

09:01.094 --> 09:04.215
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Mel, of course, you know, plays some stuff.

09:05.016 --> 09:08.537
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, everyone plays, you know, pretty average amount of games and stuff.

09:10.297 --> 09:12.238
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a lot of people, you know, really liked it.

09:12.318 --> 09:17.980
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, definitely people that were going to get a Wii are probably going to get this game as well because it's just crazy.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.001
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dance mini game was hilarious.

09:22.990 --> 09:25.392
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Shane shared this idea with us that you can do the dance.

09:25.572 --> 09:31.657
[SPEAKER_02]: You go into the mode where you just play a minigame over and over again, and you do the dance minigame, but you set it on the fastest setting.

09:32.057 --> 09:32.618
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty funny.

09:32.858 --> 09:33.338
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun to watch.

09:33.358 --> 09:34.639
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's crazy.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.123
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we played Resistance Fallen Man.

09:39.143 --> 09:42.746
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing that all week during lunches, and we played that last night, too, for a while.

09:43.146 --> 09:45.788
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a really interesting glitch after you left.

09:46.438 --> 09:47.699
[SPEAKER_01]: We were playing multiplayer.

09:47.839 --> 09:53.084
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we started off with just, you know, doing four-player multiplayer and stuff, and that's a fun game, multiplayer.

09:53.704 --> 09:59.890
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we decided, rockets only, infinite ammo, and so, and we picked really tiny maps, and that was pretty fun.

10:00.110 --> 10:03.173
[SPEAKER_01]: Except one part, um, I... Sounds like the Halo 2 games I played online, yeah.

10:03.233 --> 10:08.417
[SPEAKER_01]: Except one time, I spawned, and I just kept flying up into the air, so it was really weird.

10:09.118 --> 10:10.118
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was kind of funny.

10:10.239 --> 10:10.599
[SPEAKER_01]: And then...

10:11.627 --> 10:13.489
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys were playing Red Steel at one point too.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.629
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

10:47.732 --> 10:58.020
[SPEAKER_01]: and so 4Player, I thought it'd be cool if we tried the mode where the Wiimote rings like a phone and you pick it up and you get a mission from the person on the line.

10:58.481 --> 11:03.445
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a cool concept, but it's completely annoying and stupid at the same time.

11:03.905 --> 11:05.145
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:23.308 --> 11:24.949
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is the last draw for this game.

11:24.989 --> 11:26.529
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely selling it back now.

11:26.569 --> 11:28.950
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was a complete waste of money in the first place.

11:29.410 --> 11:30.890
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an utter disappointment.

11:30.950 --> 11:33.771
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to give it a second chance, and so I did, and it's awful.

11:34.211 --> 11:36.932
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first time you asked me, like, do you want to play this?

11:36.952 --> 11:38.853
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, I don't.

11:39.353 --> 11:41.714
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, you know, that really sucked.

11:41.774 --> 11:44.915
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I'm trying to think what else we played there.

11:46.495 --> 11:47.916
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob D. in chat agrees with you.

11:48.156 --> 11:49.556
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's right, phone mode sucks.

11:49.636 --> 11:51.777
[SPEAKER_02]: It always rings, you can't hear it, it's lame, and I hate it.

11:52.838 --> 12:00.444
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sounded like a cool concept in the beginning, you know, when they were talking about it, but it's just horribly, horribly executed.

12:00.544 --> 12:02.926
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I can't recommend that game at all.

12:03.646 --> 12:10.271
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, finally, I've been playing more Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, which I hear is now coming out on the PlayStation 2.

12:10.591 --> 12:13.353
[SPEAKER_01]: My boss will be extremely happy about that.

12:14.014 --> 12:15.755
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, you know, the usual stuff.

12:17.216 --> 12:20.819
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, right now, WarioWare is going to have to hold me over until SSX comes out.

12:21.832 --> 12:27.057
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of sucks with only one game coming out in a month, but that's about it.

12:27.718 --> 12:28.078
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

12:29.559 --> 12:30.560
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I make an interjection?

12:30.720 --> 12:31.141
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, why not?

12:31.161 --> 12:31.822
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one other game.

12:32.002 --> 12:32.502
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what's that?

12:33.503 --> 12:33.763
[SPEAKER_05]: R-Type 3.

12:34.824 --> 12:35.885
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, on the Virtual Console?

12:36.106 --> 12:36.466
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

12:36.646 --> 12:37.066
[SPEAKER_05]: How was that?

12:37.547 --> 12:40.570
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I actually never had R-Type 3 before, so it was actually really fun.

12:41.150 --> 12:45.074
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the Mode 7-tastic stuff that happens in it.

12:45.541 --> 12:54.888
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess sort of mini-boss type things pop up.

12:54.968 --> 13:05.395
[SPEAKER_05]: You can kill him in one charge shot, and then another one comes up behind you, and then he swings around you, and then you bitch can't kill him, and then he suddenly looks behind him and runs into a wall and blows up.

13:06.232 --> 13:07.493
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13:31.385 --> 13:33.146
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13:59.625 --> 14:08.834
[SPEAKER_03]: down to zero, everything except for Elite Beats on Jumping Jack Flash on Elite Beat D.Va's difficulty.

14:10.195 --> 14:15.279
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see, I just picked up Final Fantasy 3 for the DS because it's in stock again, which is nice.

14:17.462 --> 14:21.866
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played Final Fantasy for two weeks, and now I'm playing Burning Crusade.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

14:24.648 --> 14:25.429
[SPEAKER_02]: How's Burning Crusade?

14:26.495 --> 14:29.536
[SPEAKER_03]: Night Elf, or Night Elf, Blood Elf is really pretty and he jumps around and twirls.

14:29.617 --> 14:30.137
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

14:30.297 --> 14:32.778
[SPEAKER_02]: What made you decide to go on to Burning Crusade?

14:34.259 --> 14:37.920
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody else is doing it and I like to follow people.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.142
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm easily swayed.

14:41.782 --> 14:42.382
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's fun.

14:42.522 --> 14:43.223
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.

14:43.303 --> 14:43.843
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.

14:44.123 --> 14:44.783
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, good times.

14:45.023 --> 14:46.564
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to tell people your server and characters?

14:46.584 --> 14:47.544
[SPEAKER_02]: They can come play with you?

14:47.624 --> 14:48.625
[SPEAKER_02]: Or would you rather stay anonymous?

14:48.865 --> 14:49.325
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

14:49.625 --> 14:51.926
[SPEAKER_03]: My server is... What is my server?

14:52.146 --> 14:53.127
[SPEAKER_03]: Ravencrest...

14:53.806 --> 14:58.607
[SPEAKER_03]: and my character's name is Arx and I'm a 13 Blood Elf Priest.

14:58.927 --> 15:00.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any reason why you chose a Ravencrest?

15:00.687 --> 15:04.708
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it reminded me of Ravenclaw because that sounds like something Harry Potter-ish.

15:05.388 --> 15:05.668
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

15:06.549 --> 15:15.010
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, since you mentioned that Final Fantasy 3 is back in stock now, they've been actually sold out of a lot of stuff, especially the DS Lite.

15:15.771 --> 15:17.871
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo is actually completely sold out now.

15:17.931 --> 15:20.172
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be coming in stores in the next week or so.

15:20.192 --> 15:21.652
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm finally catching up.

15:21.732 --> 15:22.292
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the Wii.

15:22.776 --> 15:24.177
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been sold out for a while, too.

15:24.197 --> 15:27.039
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo's kind of slow right now.

15:27.540 --> 15:30.722
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony's kind of showing them up with the amount of units they're getting out there, but no one's buying them.

15:32.646 --> 15:37.270
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my gaming week, a lot of the same stuff most people have actually already beat me to and mentioned.

15:37.290 --> 15:40.032
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was Buzz Lightyear ride at Disneyland, which was a lot of fun.

15:40.092 --> 15:44.636
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what's weird is that the first time we went through it, we rode that ride three times, and the first time was our best score.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.718
[SPEAKER_02]: We should post that picture on Orange Lounge somewhere.

15:46.738 --> 15:47.299
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny.

15:48.139 --> 15:51.282
[SPEAKER_02]: You got like the 38th best score for the day or something, the high score.

15:51.302 --> 15:51.883
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

15:51.923 --> 15:53.104
[SPEAKER_02]: You kicked my butt at it.

15:53.364 --> 15:56.427
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of how many thousands of people that...

15:57.029 --> 15:58.870
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they do it by day.

15:59.250 --> 16:03.971
[SPEAKER_05]: The only reason we got so high of a score, though, is because it broke down while we were on it.

16:06.292 --> 16:09.473
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because the other times we never stopped in the middle of the ride.

16:09.613 --> 16:10.813
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done really well on that ride.

16:10.853 --> 16:13.794
[SPEAKER_05]: I can at least get to a rank four on a regular run through.

16:13.994 --> 16:18.835
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I was chatting from the hotel room with Bobby over at All Games, and he's like, well, I got a million.

16:18.855 --> 16:19.556
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get a million?

16:19.576 --> 16:21.696
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, but his ride stopped too.

16:24.117 --> 16:24.397
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

16:25.053 --> 16:26.113
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I played that.

16:26.213 --> 16:30.515
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've also, um, I've gone back to World of Warcraft, thanks to Burning Crusade.

16:30.775 --> 16:32.915
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is funny, though, because I didn't buy Burning Crusade.

16:33.295 --> 16:43.838
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just, I, I decided, I don't, there's not a lot in Burning Crusade for me, because I'm not all like, ooh, ah, over Blood Elves and Draenei, because everybody is playing those.

16:44.138 --> 16:49.860
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if you look at the server that Shane and I are playing on, Rave, because we always start on a freaking new server, Ravencrest.

16:50.931 --> 16:52.732
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing a tauren on Ravencrest.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.313
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not writing into anybody.

16:54.533 --> 16:55.593
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a new server.

16:55.833 --> 17:04.037
[SPEAKER_03]: All I see are blood elves and they're all paladins and they make me want to punch them because it's annoying because they all just kind of gang up on my kills I'm trying to get.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.118
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's...

17:06.061 --> 17:06.901
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.

17:08.062 --> 17:10.423
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, well, there's not a lot in Burning Crusade for me.

17:10.443 --> 17:11.964
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure, there's new areas.

17:11.984 --> 17:13.545
[SPEAKER_02]: You can level to 70 in the Jewelcrafting.

17:13.845 --> 17:18.728
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, okay, I don't want to make that investment unless I actually stick with World of Warcraft.

17:18.748 --> 17:21.969
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you've been listening to this show for a couple years, you know that I'm notorious.

17:22.029 --> 17:26.532
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play World of Warcraft for three months, quit, then start over again in a couple months on a new server.

17:26.552 --> 17:32.695
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I actually, I said, okay, Rob, if you can get a character to level 40, I will reward you by buying Burning Crusade.

17:33.595 --> 17:33.995
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

17:34.356 --> 17:35.136
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm already at what?

17:35.834 --> 17:37.295
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

17:57.230 --> 17:57.750
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

18:24.716 --> 18:25.417
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

18:48.977 --> 18:49.959
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19:00.259 --> 19:00.960
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

19:27.442 --> 19:30.444
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're a Nintendo fanboy, you probably already own it, so what are you listening to me for?

19:31.065 --> 19:32.686
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, would you agree with that, Loki?

19:32.926 --> 19:50.237
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this whole thing kind of reminds me of, you know, there could be more life in this game if they had, I don't know, leaderboards or something like that supported on the Nintendo Wii, but since they don't, and Nintendo's a fucking retarded for not doing that, you know, there's not as much life as there could be.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.079
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know, simple...

19:53.632 --> 19:53.933
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

20:00.706 --> 20:02.767
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's about... Do I have anything else for my gaming week?

20:02.827 --> 20:03.227
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

20:03.267 --> 20:04.728
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just pretty much been playing those.

20:04.788 --> 20:07.809
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot of... Oh, no, there is one new game I wanted to mention also.

20:08.830 --> 20:12.471
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought Heavy Weapon on Xbox Live Arcade, which is a PopCap game.

20:12.491 --> 20:13.952
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the folks that made Bejeweled and Zuma.

20:14.232 --> 20:15.993
[SPEAKER_02]: But Heavy Weapon is a very different type of game.

20:16.033 --> 20:16.773
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a puzzle game.

20:16.813 --> 20:17.593
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of an action game.

20:17.893 --> 20:19.834
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of an old 16-bit shooter.

20:20.415 --> 20:26.097
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people have been giving Heavy Weapon a lot of crap because, you know, they go, Oh, another PopCap game.

20:26.508 --> 20:27.609
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out after Ms.

20:27.649 --> 20:28.190
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Man.

20:28.330 --> 20:30.792
[SPEAKER_02]: God, the live arcade lineup sucks.

20:30.832 --> 20:34.576
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, well, I could play this on, you know, for free on Flash and da-da-da-da-da.

20:35.497 --> 20:39.061
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people are passing judgment on this game before playing it.

20:39.181 --> 20:43.105
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would bet some of your favorite bloggers are doing this, too, after reading one and reading some bloggers.

20:43.805 --> 20:47.089
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people were posting those types of opinions before the game even came out.

20:47.469 --> 20:50.432
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were basing their opinions, I know this, off the Flash version of the game.

20:51.195 --> 20:52.195
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

21:12.280 --> 21:13.100
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

21:36.088 --> 21:39.470
[SPEAKER_02]: If the website is good enough for you and you play the game with them, fine.

21:39.790 --> 21:40.631
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you don't need to spend the $10.

21:41.391 --> 21:45.975
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you enjoy those types of games, I think you'd really benefit from multiplayer and some of the other modes this game has.

21:45.995 --> 21:53.860
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of fun with it and I kind of want to play it again when my TV's free of Elebits because Extifer's been playing Elebits nonstop.

21:53.880 --> 21:54.241
[SPEAKER_02]: He beat it.

21:54.441 --> 21:55.422
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the final boss in the game.

21:55.442 --> 21:57.643
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like this Voltron Elebit type thing.

21:57.683 --> 21:58.184
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.

21:59.104 --> 22:00.785
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know Elebits was so long.

22:00.805 --> 22:01.586
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it has like 25, 26 stages.

22:03.240 --> 22:18.054
[SPEAKER_02]: and the stages in that game go on for like 10-20 minutes at a time so there's quite a bit of replayability in all of it so I was surprised so I do recommend Heavy Weapon for those fans of shooters at least even if you just have access to Xbox Live check out the demo you might like it so

22:18.766 --> 22:19.387
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

22:35.439 --> 22:41.261
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, just a reminder, we do have programming here on OrangeLawnTrader.com almost every weeknight throughout the week.

22:41.981 --> 22:46.902
[SPEAKER_02]: First Tuesday of every month, DarkSakura is live with Pump Up the Volume, so she's due for a new show pretty soon.

22:47.582 --> 22:49.623
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday nights, guys on a show, myself and Extover.

22:50.103 --> 22:53.144
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday nights, STFU with DMN and DJ Tyrant.

22:53.184 --> 22:55.444
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday night, Club OLR mixed by Loki.

22:55.984 --> 23:02.066
[SPEAKER_02]: And Saturday nights, Travis Donovan live, which is always pretty hilarious, and he does a lot of the chat room interaction stuff too.

23:02.106 --> 23:02.906
[SPEAKER_02]: So check those shows out.

23:04.315 --> 23:05.075
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23:26.244 --> 23:28.486
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge news happens literally in our backyard.

23:28.726 --> 23:29.367
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean literally.

23:29.727 --> 23:36.993
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, we're referring to the Hold Your Wii for a Wii contest that one of our local stations here, 1079, held.

23:37.554 --> 23:40.636
[SPEAKER_02]: Their morning rave show or whatever held this Hold Your Wii for a Wii contest.

23:40.936 --> 23:47.522
[SPEAKER_02]: And, unfortunately, it ended, or I should say resulted, because it was about a couple hours after the contest ended, resulted in the death of

23:48.118 --> 23:52.202
[SPEAKER_02]: Jennifer Strange, a 28-year-old who was trying to win a Wii for her family.

23:52.883 --> 23:53.964
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very interesting.

23:54.004 --> 24:00.230
[SPEAKER_02]: Jennifer Strange lived not even about two miles from where we record Orange Lounge Radio.

24:00.430 --> 24:03.933
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of weird, kind of hit home, that whole story.

24:04.914 --> 24:10.139
[SPEAKER_02]: And at first, I don't know about you guys when you heard about this, but at first I was kind of thinking, this isn't...

24:11.339 --> 24:15.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was reading about it on, you know, Kotaku, Destructoid, and all those gaming blogs.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.842
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking, this really isn't about gaming.

24:18.343 --> 24:25.466
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I understand why these sites covered it, so I'm not trying to fault that or anything, but I'm kind of thinking to myself, we're really digging a hole for this.

24:25.526 --> 24:27.107
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not really about the gaming.

24:27.147 --> 24:38.412
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure, it's a tragic story, but that goes more to the whole, where was the responsibility of the DJs, the station, the woman that competed in the contest, you know, all that types of back and forth.

24:38.873 --> 24:39.353
[SPEAKER_02]: But then...

24:40.251 --> 24:40.611
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

25:00.393 --> 25:01.815
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

25:16.992 --> 25:18.934
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thinking, okay, it's not really gaming related.

25:19.054 --> 25:21.977
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we should talk about it on Sunday's show because it's kind of been talked about to death.

25:22.257 --> 25:23.858
[SPEAKER_02]: But then this late-breaking thing happened.

25:23.878 --> 25:27.642
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught the news on Thursday, and I posted about this to OrangeLawnTrader.com.

25:28.062 --> 25:30.644
[SPEAKER_02]: We were watching local news, and they were talking about this whole thing.

25:30.884 --> 25:38.751
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the reporter, I guess, had talked to the lawyer, and the reporter said that they were considering expanding the lawsuit that was filed against the station.

25:38.771 --> 25:41.534
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously, a civil lawsuit was filed in her death.

25:41.594 --> 25:42.755
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we all saw that coming.

25:43.235 --> 25:51.539
[SPEAKER_02]: The lawsuit is being considered to expand Nintendo and promoters for Justin Timberlake because Justin Timberlake's tickets were involved in this concert, too.

25:51.559 --> 25:52.960
[SPEAKER_02]: They were in the contest, too.

25:52.980 --> 25:54.040
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a consolation prize.

25:54.421 --> 25:59.643
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's kind of, well, now we're kind of roping it back into gaming because Nintendo could get sued over this whole thing.

26:00.824 --> 26:01.564
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is stupid.

26:02.563 --> 26:03.343
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really stupid.

26:03.363 --> 26:04.423
[SPEAKER_05]: They had nothing to do with it.

26:04.503 --> 26:05.544
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.

26:05.604 --> 26:15.325
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, unless they can prove that Nintendo somehow sponsored this contest, which I doubt, I highly, highly, highly doubt they would sponsor a contest called Hold Your Wii for a Wii.

26:15.565 --> 26:17.125
[SPEAKER_02]: They would have never done that, okay?

26:17.446 --> 26:24.887
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless they can somehow prove that Nintendo sponsored this contest, I don't see that really happening, that they're going to be able to sue them.

26:24.987 --> 26:26.867
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe that's what they're exploring right now.

26:26.887 --> 26:27.147
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

26:27.167 --> 26:31.908
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the lawyer would like to do because Nintendo is a large company and he thinks that he can get money from them, so...

26:32.594 --> 26:38.177
[SPEAKER_01]: And although I can understand where her family is coming from, I mean, it was very tragic what happened to her, although I do believe she is partially to blame, I felt...

26:56.588 --> 26:59.630
[SPEAKER_02]: She was more to blame until I heard the audio of the whole thing.

26:59.750 --> 27:06.494
[SPEAKER_02]: When I heard how crass the DJs were in talking about, you know, well, they signed waivers, what's the worst they've had, and the fact that people had called them.

27:06.794 --> 27:12.837
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a co-worker who listened to it, and she was telling me at work about how the one doctor we all heard about was not the only one to call in.

27:12.897 --> 27:18.060
[SPEAKER_02]: She said at least two doctors called in telling them not to do it, and they still continue to do it anyway.

27:18.340 --> 27:22.343
[SPEAKER_02]: So while, yeah, I kind of fault her for participating, I think there's blame.

27:22.663 --> 27:23.763
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just tragic.

27:23.843 --> 27:24.684
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing's tragic.

27:25.487 --> 27:26.448
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:45.339 --> 27:47.381
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, she deserves her Darwin Award.

27:47.681 --> 27:56.268
[SPEAKER_05]: The DJs also, I think, were responsible for not thinking it through, for being pretty much, yeah, they were idiots.

27:56.288 --> 27:58.450
[SPEAKER_05]: They also deserve to be Darwinized.

27:58.530 --> 27:59.971
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet.

28:00.772 --> 28:06.216
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think in kinda and sorta, I believe in every party was at fault.

28:06.817 --> 28:07.557
[SPEAKER_05]: She was at fault.

28:07.717 --> 28:08.398
[SPEAKER_05]: She deserves it.

28:09.022 --> 28:09.682
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:28.347 --> 28:35.309
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they probably didn't know that it was, you know, I mean, because it's basically, okay, who can hold it the longest before they have to go.

28:35.869 --> 28:36.649
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't the issue.

28:36.689 --> 28:39.950
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't because she held back her urine that she died.

28:39.970 --> 28:43.831
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because she drank, like, gallons and gallons of water really quick.

28:44.451 --> 28:48.653
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wouldn't have mattered even if she went afterwards, because I'm assuming she did go afterwards.

28:49.033 --> 28:50.153
[SPEAKER_01]: The damage was already done.

28:50.626 --> 28:53.427
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, now they had them fill out waivers.

28:53.467 --> 28:57.309
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they have generic waivers at the radio stations to have people fill out for their contests.

28:57.369 --> 29:00.270
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically saying, oh, we don't hold you liable for this and this.

29:00.510 --> 29:14.717
[SPEAKER_01]: But they didn't disclose, at least it seems like from what I've heard on the radio and stuff, the recordings of it, they didn't really disclose what possible dangers were and say you might die from this if there's too much or something like that.

29:15.877 --> 29:20.199
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think they did the research, or if they did, they just completely shrugged it off

29:20.842 --> 29:22.583
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what the issue is.

29:22.643 --> 29:24.964
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a matter of, you know, if they signed waivers or not.

29:24.984 --> 29:29.767
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just they didn't disclose the possible risks, you know, of participating in this activity.

29:29.787 --> 29:34.370
[SPEAKER_01]: Because not everyone, you know, is aware that, you know, drinking that much water could cause you to die.

29:34.770 --> 29:37.632
[SPEAKER_01]: You would just think that you'd just have to really go to the bathroom really bad.

29:38.873 --> 29:44.656
[SPEAKER_01]: So with a lot of these people not knowing, I mean, you can't really hold them responsible for that.

29:44.856 --> 29:46.277
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, it's a stupid thing, but hey.

29:46.997 --> 29:47.478
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

30:04.601 --> 30:08.104
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought they said that she stopped when she did feel sick.

30:08.784 --> 30:11.526
[SPEAKER_02]: She did quit the contest.

30:11.847 --> 30:14.569
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I read about it, I didn't know about water poisoning.

30:14.709 --> 30:16.630
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, okay, that's crazy.

30:16.790 --> 30:18.511
[SPEAKER_05]: How could you not know about it?

30:19.152 --> 30:21.534
[SPEAKER_05]: You can drink so much water that it kills you.

30:21.574 --> 30:23.095
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're pretty much saturating.

30:23.115 --> 30:28.879
[SPEAKER_03]: But being a radio contest, I thought they would have taken the precautions to warn the contestants and stuff.

30:29.643 --> 30:31.587
[SPEAKER_03]: or at least have somebody on hand.

30:32.007 --> 30:35.733
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying at all that the DJs in the station were not at fault.

30:36.214 --> 30:37.897
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying that there's equal fault.

30:38.835 --> 30:44.576
[SPEAKER_05]: And, I mean, maybe everybody doesn't know that you can, you know, drink yourself of water to death.

30:44.696 --> 30:45.736
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was common sense.

30:46.256 --> 30:47.537
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting perspective in the chat room.

30:47.557 --> 30:51.137
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike W. says, DarkSakura, it's not the DJ's fault for doing what his boss told him.

30:51.577 --> 30:54.658
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree to an extent, and that's why ten people were fired over this.

30:54.698 --> 30:57.759
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's why, you know, certainly a lot of people, not just the DJs, were fired.

30:57.839 --> 31:05.400
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm telling you, if you listen to the audio, which is available on one of our local newspapers, SACB.com has audio of the whole thing.

31:05.880 --> 31:11.741
[SPEAKER_02]: My whole point is that anything that's going to affect the body, you really, really need to understand what the risks are before you decide to do it.

31:35.131 --> 31:35.791
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my point.

31:36.651 --> 31:40.012
[SPEAKER_05]: And it came out more harshly than I intended it to.

31:40.772 --> 31:48.433
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, and I'm not saying anyone deserves to die, but I'm saying that if you die of your own ignorance, then that is on you.

31:48.473 --> 31:48.833
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

31:49.453 --> 31:55.314
[SPEAKER_05]: But they did have, and I think that they should have been more than fired.

31:55.354 --> 31:57.175
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they really need to stand trial for it.

31:57.695 --> 32:04.516
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that those that were in charge of the contest, they had a duty to make sure that the risks were put out there.

32:05.770 --> 32:09.473
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess for the people who don't have common knowledge of this.

32:10.014 --> 32:10.274
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

32:10.314 --> 32:12.236
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we could talk for hours and hours about this.

32:12.276 --> 32:13.417
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, we did on Wednesday's show.

32:13.457 --> 32:14.998
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked for at least an hour about this.

32:15.078 --> 32:18.401
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the interest of getting to more news, I'm directly involved with gaming.

32:18.441 --> 32:19.301
[SPEAKER_02]: We do want to move on.

32:19.702 --> 32:22.644
[SPEAKER_02]: We do welcome your emails and voicemails on this topic.

32:22.684 --> 32:27.468
[SPEAKER_02]: But please keep in mind, since this is a controversial issue, we're probably not going to get to read everything we get on it.

32:28.048 --> 32:29.129
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do welcome your thoughts.

32:29.249 --> 32:32.292
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLaundry.com or our voicemail, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

32:35.214 --> 32:39.577
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on and talk about some news that is definitely directly about gaming.

32:39.617 --> 32:40.658
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's got something for us?

32:41.198 --> 32:41.538
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

32:42.219 --> 32:43.640
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about some dates here.

32:44.420 --> 32:49.203
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a lot piling up actually the last two weeks and even some stuff we announced on the site a little bit.

32:49.924 --> 32:52.125
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet no one seems to be picking up on that.

32:52.686 --> 32:57.989
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of stuff being announced this week, especially on all the big sites.

32:58.269 --> 33:00.771
[SPEAKER_01]: They were announcing a crazy taxi for the PSP.

33:01.772 --> 33:02.592
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a big surprise.

33:02.692 --> 33:03.413
[SPEAKER_01]: That's coming June 13th.

33:04.892 --> 33:17.038
[SPEAKER_01]: Some other stuff, Two Worlds, the PS3 version I guess is being delayed to October 10th and then the Xbox 360 one will be coming out in May on the 16th.

33:17.938 --> 33:19.819
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's some stuff that we probably already knew about.

33:20.360 --> 33:25.482
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are a lot of things that many people haven't heard about yet and some stuff that's a little bit surprising.

33:26.763 --> 33:29.464
[SPEAKER_01]: First off here, we've got...

33:30.393 --> 33:35.895
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, a bunch of no-brainer titles, like a new bunch of movie-based stuff.

33:36.956 --> 33:47.681
[SPEAKER_01]: Ratatouille for pretty much every system out there except for the original Xbox to tie in with the upcoming Pixar movie.

33:48.421 --> 33:55.004
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, we've got Surf's Up also tying with the new movie coming out, and that's coming out in May.

33:56.205 --> 33:56.965
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting, though,

33:57.912 --> 34:03.615
[SPEAKER_01]: and beyond all that stuff, and like Spider-Man 3 and Transformers and Shrek the Third.

34:04.175 --> 34:07.197
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some interesting stuff like Dog Island.

34:07.777 --> 34:12.319
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you remember when they were first showing off the Wii stuff in Japan.

34:12.759 --> 34:23.805
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was a Hudson game, but it's basically that character, the dog, where they have the giant heads, kind of almost like, I don't know, some sort of toy thing over there.

34:24.489 --> 34:28.690
[SPEAKER_01]: That's coming out on the PlayStation 2 and the Wii May 23rd, which is kind of interesting.

34:29.530 --> 34:30.550
[SPEAKER_01]: Some bigger stuff, though.

34:30.630 --> 34:33.151
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy Fables, Chocobo Tales.

34:33.531 --> 34:36.372
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be coming out on the DS April 25th.

34:36.772 --> 34:39.873
[SPEAKER_01]: Dawn of Mana, finally making its way out to the PlayStation 2.

34:39.933 --> 34:41.633
[SPEAKER_01]: That's May 15th.

34:43.153 --> 34:48.815
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, Guitar Hero 2 for the 360 is going to be coming out at the end of March on the 28th.

34:49.755 --> 34:50.475
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty big.

34:51.408 --> 35:12.790
[SPEAKER_01]: and then, um, some other interesting stuff, MotorStorm, MLB07 The Show, and God of War 2 have all been delayed a month, um, to March 14th now, so that's kind of interesting, uh, same with Fear also got delayed to that time, and then, of course, the big one that we announced on the site, uh, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic has been announced for the Xbox 360, and, um,

35:15.936 --> 35:23.358
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that was something that was being rumored to have happened ever since, actually before the 360 even came out, so it's kind of interesting there.

35:25.478 --> 35:36.601
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see, and then, you know, other interesting stuff, Samurai Slash, which would be Samurai Warriors, the Koei game, coming to the Wii, and that's going to be May 16th.

35:37.521 --> 35:41.462
[SPEAKER_01]: Fatal Inertia, Bladestorm, also coming out on the 360 and the PlayStation 3, April 18th.

35:45.483 --> 35:51.688
[SPEAKER_01]: which, you know, Koei actually came out and officially said summer, but April 18th is more accurate.

35:52.088 --> 35:52.849
[SPEAKER_01]: Kane and Lynch.

35:52.929 --> 36:00.615
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this one I'm kind of, you know, shaking my head with because I thought it was PlayStation 3 and the 360, but we have an announcement for PlayStation 2 and the 360.

36:00.735 --> 36:04.117
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, but that's interesting.

36:04.838 --> 36:06.099
[SPEAKER_01]: June 20th for that one.

36:07.980 --> 36:11.683
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's probably all the big stuff I'd say.

36:12.284 --> 36:13.004
[SPEAKER_01]: Just lots of dates.

36:13.024 --> 36:17.465
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't post more in that Under the Radar thread, though, if you want to check out the details there.

36:17.485 --> 36:19.325
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be posting some of that to the front page, really.

36:19.905 --> 36:22.406
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not heard of God of War being pushed back.

36:22.446 --> 36:23.106
[SPEAKER_02]: That's news to me.

36:23.426 --> 36:25.466
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I haven't been following for that story very closely.

36:25.747 --> 36:26.707
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's kind of cool, too.

36:26.827 --> 36:28.527
[SPEAKER_01]: Senko no Rondo for the 360.

36:28.567 --> 36:34.568
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an Ikaruga-style shooter that's coming out on May 16th as well.

36:36.048 --> 36:37.709
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, lots of big stuff.

36:38.869 --> 36:39.149
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

36:39.892 --> 36:40.773
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for the insight.

36:40.813 --> 36:42.814
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some, what's coming out next week?

36:43.055 --> 36:43.795
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not much.

36:44.056 --> 36:45.557
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I figured as much.

36:45.897 --> 36:47.458
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much of anything, actually.

36:48.920 --> 36:51.802
[SPEAKER_01]: Next week is a bunch of portable games, and that's pretty much it.

36:52.923 --> 36:53.423
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.

36:54.024 --> 36:58.127
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've got the, was it Hotel 219?

36:58.848 --> 36:58.127
213.

36:58.868 --> 37:01.230
[SPEAKER_01]: 213, my mistake.

37:02.231 --> 37:04.473
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be coming out on the DS.

37:05.194 --> 37:08.216
[SPEAKER_02]: Megalotov, you've been talking to me about this game a lot today.

37:08.236 --> 37:09.456
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you so excited about it?

37:09.636 --> 37:15.439
[SPEAKER_03]: It's by the people that do Trace Memory, and I love Trace Memory for the two hours that you get to play it for.

37:16.340 --> 37:19.882
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like a film noir looking... Oh, it's 2.15.

37:21.582 --> 37:27.745
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like a film noir thing where you're like some detective guy, and you hold your DS book style.

37:28.086 --> 37:28.666
[SPEAKER_02]: Like brain training?

37:28.926 --> 37:31.427
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's just an adventure game.

37:31.647 --> 37:32.048
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

37:32.328 --> 37:32.548
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_01]: and Alien Shooter Vengeance on the PC and then Salmon Max Episode 3, The Mole, The Mob and The Meatball.

38:04.503 --> 38:06.024
[SPEAKER_01]: More episodic content for you.

38:07.204 --> 38:07.584
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

38:08.484 --> 38:12.846
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have our UK release dates if anybody is interested.

[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of UK, you know our opening story, the controversial one this evening.

38:58.811 --> 39:00.312
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how I knew that was big news?

39:00.732 --> 39:02.153
[SPEAKER_02]: When I saw it on BBC News.

39:02.594 --> 39:04.055
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I was like, wow.

39:05.396 --> 39:12.620
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't know about the don't drink water and don't go to the bathroom thing before, you sure as hell will now.

[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody in the world will know it.

39:13.841 --> 39:14.802
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something else.

39:15.442 --> 39:16.763

[SPEAKER_05]: We were just talking about Salamander and Life Force this morning.

42:13.591 --> 42:17.312
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gradius moves into the best, so a big week if you're a Gradius fan over in Japan.

42:17.592 --> 42:19.792
[SPEAKER_02]: So while it may be a slow week here in the U.S.

42:19.872 --> 42:22.773
[SPEAKER_02]: and U.K., it's a busy week over there in Japan.

42:22.893 --> 42:26.294
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to mention, though, this week they did announce

42:26.650 --> 42:28.392
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

42:48.532 --> 42:50.813
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow Charlie seems to enjoy Parodius as well.

42:51.353 --> 42:54.774
[SPEAKER_02]: Parodius has some badass music, says Shadow Charlie.

42:55.254 --> 42:58.275
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shadow Charlie also wants to know, is DDR Universe out yet?

42:58.335 --> 42:59.455
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is no.

42:59.855 --> 43:03.596
[SPEAKER_02]: So those that were thinking it's coming out in January, looks like it really was March.

43:03.696 --> 43:05.816
[SPEAKER_02]: After all, Loki wins again.

43:07.677 --> 43:12.218
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have a little bit more on use as far as things that are going to be playable this year.

43:13.007 --> 43:15.549
[SPEAKER_05]: The Final Fantasy XIII demo is due out.

43:15.929 --> 43:18.151
[SPEAKER_05]: They said ready for E3 in 2007.

43:21.513 --> 43:30.899
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure which one I guess they mean, because given that there's multiple Final Fantasy XIII going on, two of them going on with Squeenix.

43:34.261 --> 43:36.563
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if they mean both or just one or the other of them.

43:36.889 --> 43:38.650
[SPEAKER_01]: They should do 13 versions of that.

43:39.470 --> 43:40.210
[SPEAKER_01]: That would make sense.

43:41.271 --> 43:42.251
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably will, eventually.

43:42.271 --> 43:43.191
[SPEAKER_05]: That would make me cry.

43:44.272 --> 43:47.153
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already got, what, 13 versions of Final Fantasy VII, practically.

43:47.373 --> 43:48.373
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even feel like counting.

43:49.594 --> 43:53.315
[SPEAKER_02]: Or 13 versions of Final Fantasy I, as we're going to find out later in the program.

43:54.596 --> 44:00.558
[SPEAKER_05]: But at any rate, the two are going to... I love Latin.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.098
[SPEAKER_05]: Fabula Nova Crystallis.

44:02.138 --> 44:03.059
[SPEAKER_05]: That just sounds cool.

44:03.219 --> 44:05.040
[SPEAKER_05]: The new Tale of the Crystal.

44:05.860 --> 44:06.240
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool.

44:07.079 --> 44:14.046
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of interesting, especially when folks are saying that the PlayStation 3 really needs its big title right now.

44:14.106 --> 44:18.711
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of interesting how this Final Fantasy XIII news is kind of slowly leaking out, right?

44:19.392 --> 44:20.473
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what they need?

44:20.513 --> 44:22.856
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like Final Fantasy VII for the PlayStation.

44:22.916 --> 44:24.617
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hell, I bought that system for that game.

44:24.637 --> 44:25.058
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

44:25.198 --> 44:27.360
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not buy a PlayStation until Final Fantasy VII.

44:27.520 --> 44:27.981
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

44:28.301 --> 44:28.962
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit.

44:29.520 --> 44:39.023
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIII, especially depending on this demo, you know, after I play the demo, will probably be the thing that finally breaks me to get a PlayStation 3, because I'm the only OLR host that doesn't own one.

44:40.924 --> 44:41.564
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm poor.

44:42.384 --> 44:45.665
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so more on Final Fantasy XIII.

44:45.745 --> 44:48.206
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been leaked out by Famitsu and Dengeki.

44:49.307 --> 44:57.069
[SPEAKER_01]: Some stuff they're talking about, I guess, from the playable demo, including apparently it's going to have a really awesome opening scene.

44:57.349 --> 44:58.430
[SPEAKER_01]: It says probably the most...

44:59.855 --> 45:01.857
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that means his penis is going to be huge too.

45:28.743 --> 45:29.223
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever.

45:29.744 --> 45:35.388
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully we'll get some more important information on Final Fantasy XIII coming soon.

45:35.828 --> 45:36.849
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than shoe sizes.

45:38.170 --> 45:39.031
[SPEAKER_01]: We need bus sizes.

45:39.071 --> 45:39.651
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we need.

45:40.392 --> 45:41.312
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's that information?

45:42.033 --> 45:45.295
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm definitely looking forward to more and more information on Final Fantasy XIII.

45:45.636 --> 45:52.120
[SPEAKER_02]: Being the self-confessed Final Fantasy fanboy I am, I'm personally very excited for all the latest.

45:52.481 --> 45:54.282
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see hopefully more in the next few weeks.

45:55.905 --> 45:58.526
[SPEAKER_02]: More things that Japan is seeing is apparently PlayStation 3.

45:58.946 --> 46:03.648
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony put out a release this week that says they have sold one million of the machines.

46:03.788 --> 46:04.148
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

46:04.569 --> 46:04.909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

46:04.989 --> 46:05.169
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait.

46:05.329 --> 46:05.949
[SPEAKER_02]: Key difference here.

46:05.969 --> 46:08.911
[SPEAKER_02]: They have shipped one million machines in Japan.

46:09.111 --> 46:10.171
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry there.

46:10.411 --> 46:11.872
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I almost fell for the trick there.

46:11.952 --> 46:14.674
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so tired of these fucking companies doing this shit.

46:14.754 --> 46:15.694
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we've shipped them.

46:16.094 --> 46:16.755
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for you.

46:16.855 --> 46:18.095
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken a shit, too.

46:18.155 --> 46:19.636
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do you want news on that, too?

46:20.076 --> 46:21.717
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously, I can...

46:22.466 --> 46:23.786
[SPEAKER_01]: So you shipped that many.

46:23.807 --> 46:27.788
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't they say they've manufactured that many or thought about manufacturing that many?

46:27.948 --> 46:33.970
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be interesting to note that Sony only actually sold about 470,000 at the end of 2006.

46:34.150 --> 46:36.251
[SPEAKER_02]: That was their year's end sale figure.

46:36.311 --> 46:38.912
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of interesting that this release comes out now.

46:38.932 --> 46:40.772
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, oh, we've actually shipped a million.

46:41.152 --> 46:42.573
[SPEAKER_02]: So does that mean that half of them are shitting?

46:43.013 --> 46:43.293
[SPEAKER_02]: Shitting?

46:44.153 --> 46:45.454
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting on shelves?

46:45.754 --> 46:47.155
[SPEAKER_02]: They're shitting on the seashore.

46:47.975 --> 46:48.435
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got like...

46:49.382 --> 46:51.044
[SPEAKER_02]: I got dyslexia of the mouth today.

46:51.084 --> 46:51.604
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

46:51.624 --> 46:53.766
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm combining words that don't need to be combined.

46:53.786 --> 46:54.866
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what's wrong today.

46:54.926 --> 46:55.847
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize, folks.

46:56.908 --> 46:58.749
[SPEAKER_02]: Amateur radio at its finest.

46:59.790 --> 47:01.331
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this is why we don't get paid to do what we do.

47:03.493 --> 47:14.441
[SPEAKER_02]: Should you have half a million of them sitting on the store shelves, or have they moved a whole bunch in the last two weeks that they've now shipped more to compensate for that?

47:14.561 --> 47:15.362
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know.

47:15.422 --> 47:18.404
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to understand, they've shipped more units to the stores.

47:19.454 --> 47:31.996
[SPEAKER_01]: to allow for more elaborate towers to be made out of the units that no one's buying, including castles and the traditional Christmas tree tower type thing.

47:32.546 --> 47:45.336
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, it should be noted that now they have achieved their goal of shipping 2 million units worldwide about two weeks late from the deadline, but keep in mind that was a goal that got smaller and smaller before the PS3's release.

47:45.356 --> 47:47.398
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't their goal to sell that many units?

47:47.598 --> 47:47.978
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

47:48.639 --> 47:51.941
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're saying 6 million at the end of March they will ship.

47:53.543 --> 47:59.447
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to see that they were able to hit their twice-adjusted goal two weeks late.

48:00.028 --> 48:00.828
[SPEAKER_01]: Way to go, Sony.

48:01.569 --> 48:01.589
[SPEAKER_02]: I

48:02.236 --> 48:04.118
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, look, I don't write it, I just report on it.

48:04.158 --> 48:04.618
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

48:05.459 --> 48:06.560
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what else to tell you.

48:07.320 --> 48:08.421
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what else to tell people.

48:08.441 --> 48:08.781
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

48:09.502 --> 48:16.988
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, it's been listed that the PlayStation 3 is going to be more expensive in Ireland, and I don't know why.

48:19.350 --> 48:27.217
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually listed on This Is Living that the price of the PlayStation 3 in Ireland is going to be...

48:28.315 --> 48:32.958
[SPEAKER_05]: 629.99 euros instead of the announced 5.99.

48:35.219 --> 48:50.448
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually, the speculation is that it actually is going to be an increase all over Europe, but just that Ireland got the update first, so I really hope that it's

48:51.448 --> 48:55.913
[SPEAKER_05]: Not true, you know, that they keep it the $5.99 because that's going to piss off a lot of people.

48:56.154 --> 49:00.058
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard it was because the higher VAT prices in Ireland.

49:00.419 --> 49:06.706
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Seisha is one of our UK listeners, and he's in chat right now saying it's not just Ireland, but the entirety of the UK as well.

49:07.366 --> 49:07.547
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

49:08.211 --> 49:09.272
[SPEAKER_02]: Has Sony released?

49:09.552 --> 49:15.595
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we read that to be that it was just Ireland, but maybe something's changed since that published.

49:16.535 --> 49:18.356
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if all their VAT prices went up, I don't know.

49:18.396 --> 49:20.517
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, has Sony even officially confirmed anything?

49:20.577 --> 49:24.179
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we still don't have a firm date for the UK, do we?

49:24.539 --> 49:26.520
[SPEAKER_01]: They've confirmed non-confirmation.

49:27.621 --> 49:31.002
[SPEAKER_02]: So does this mean we don't really know anything, or what's it boiled down to?

49:31.683 --> 49:33.784
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that their shipping units...

49:36.098 --> 49:37.718
[SPEAKER_01]: Some day, some amount.

49:37.939 --> 49:45.321
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, there is an update, a posted update, that that's exactly why it did increase.

49:45.681 --> 49:55.443
[SPEAKER_05]: For the rest of everybody else, it's going to be $5.99 for the $60 and $4.25 for the... Damn you, Ireland, setting the bar for everyone else.

49:56.363 --> 49:57.104
[SPEAKER_01]: Just buy the $20.

49:57.264 --> 49:57.964
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't need the $60.

49:58.644 --> 49:58.824
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

49:58.924 --> 49:59.804
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the $60.

49:59.924 --> 50:01.345
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it, but I use my HDMI.

50:03.700 --> 50:05.241
[SPEAKER_02]: So is HDMI that important?

50:05.261 --> 50:05.761
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

50:06.081 --> 50:07.022
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on both units.

50:07.822 --> 50:10.243
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was a big thing that it wasn't going to be on the 20 gig.

50:10.263 --> 50:11.223
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, then they changed that.

50:11.604 --> 50:11.864
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

50:12.024 --> 50:13.044
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's on both units.

50:13.064 --> 50:13.785
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get that memo.

50:14.045 --> 50:15.045
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still stupid.

50:15.065 --> 50:16.286
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the 60 and I like it.

50:16.586 --> 50:16.886
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

50:17.166 --> 50:17.466
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

50:18.286 --> 50:19.547
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm running out of room on the 360 with the 20 gig.

50:19.567 --> 50:20.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can always upgrade.

50:20.667 --> 50:20.888
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

50:24.699 --> 50:29.702
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, those hard drives, the 2.5 inch SATA drives are fucking expensive, but whatever.

50:29.882 --> 50:31.222
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't made a decision on what I want to do yet.

50:31.483 --> 50:32.503
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too poor, I know that much.

50:32.523 --> 50:40.067
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, one reason you might want to upgrade that 2.5 inch SATA drive in your PS3 is to run Myth TV on it.

50:40.547 --> 50:49.011
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you install the second operating system or Linux on your other partition, there is actually a way now to get Myth TV to run.

50:49.912 --> 50:51.973
[SPEAKER_01]: Using a USB TV tuner,

50:52.842 --> 50:56.003
[SPEAKER_01]: and a wonderful set of homemade drivers for it.

50:56.824 --> 51:06.047
[SPEAKER_01]: You too can run the wonderful TVR software to be able to record your favorite shows and dump them onto your hopefully larger hard drive.

51:06.968 --> 51:07.708
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty cool.

51:09.249 --> 51:11.410
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.

51:12.010 --> 51:17.692
[SPEAKER_01]: I might try that since I don't really have room on my other drive, although I need to get a capture card for that.

51:17.792 --> 51:19.573
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, that's great.

51:20.558 --> 51:26.262
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, from one TV-enabled system to another, let's go over to Microsoft IPTV.

51:26.322 --> 51:30.585
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, this was announced at CES, and details are starting to fill in.

51:30.865 --> 51:35.888
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lengthy quote here from the Microsoft TV site of what exactly this thing does.

51:36.349 --> 51:47.016
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, Microsoft TV IPTV Edition is an integrated and comprehensive software platform developed specifically to deliver broadcast quality video and new integrated TV services over broadband networks.

51:47.396 --> 51:47.857
[SPEAKER_02]: and many more.

52:13.158 --> 52:18.006
[SPEAKER_02]: and for cable operators looking to deliver differentiated TV services and experiences.

52:25.126 --> 52:29.689
[SPEAKER_02]: Download it or just plug on to your Xbox 360 and boom, you get TV through your 360.

52:29.810 --> 52:30.410
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, no, no, no.

52:30.730 --> 52:37.555
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to switch up your cable provider who therefore will also provide your internet and so on and so on.

52:37.635 --> 52:45.842
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really going to have to make an adjustment change when it comes to how your services such as internet and TV are provided in your house.

52:46.642 --> 52:52.386
[SPEAKER_02]: If people are thinking, oh, this is just some cool little enhancement of 360, it's a little more than that.

52:53.327 --> 52:54.408
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of makes me think like

52:55.886 --> 53:00.588
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost like Microsoft is now becoming a rival to Satellite in a way.

53:00.668 --> 53:00.968
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

53:01.028 --> 53:02.108
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's a little bit far-fetched.

53:02.148 --> 53:04.209
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the best way to phrase it, but I don't know.

53:04.229 --> 53:04.830
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

53:04.850 --> 53:07.310
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something you might be interested in checking out?

53:07.571 --> 53:08.731
[SPEAKER_01]: I would check it out, definitely.

53:08.871 --> 53:09.771
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you make that change?

53:09.811 --> 53:11.032
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you get rid of what you have now for this?

53:11.832 --> 53:12.372
[SPEAKER_01]: What I have?

53:12.392 --> 53:14.533
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because cable's fucking too expensive.

53:15.013 --> 53:17.654
[SPEAKER_01]: If it had some good programming on it, hell yeah.

53:18.275 --> 53:22.096
[SPEAKER_01]: If it had everything, although I imagine IPTV doesn't probably have everything.

53:22.416 --> 53:24.437
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it might have some specific channels, you know.

53:25.720 --> 53:26.020
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

53:26.540 --> 53:33.643
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, it would be a good addition to, if not, replacing my current TV.

53:34.183 --> 53:36.584
[SPEAKER_01]: Although my current TV is expensive, and I hate it.

53:38.084 --> 53:40.885
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at some comments from chatroom, chat.orangelunchradio.com.

53:41.185 --> 53:44.026
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackboy says, basically the 360 becomes a cable box.

53:44.346 --> 53:45.646
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's kind of one way you can think of it.

53:46.247 --> 53:47.687
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a waste.

53:49.078 --> 53:57.125
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, again, this is Microsoft doing the Trojan horse thing, and they've openly admitted that they did not put out the 360 to do just gaming.

53:57.745 --> 54:03.170
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and now it's down to, you know, it sounds to me like cable versus satellite versus the 360.

54:03.590 --> 54:06.713
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can do what I do, and that's not watch TV and get a life.

54:07.748 --> 54:11.071
[SPEAKER_02]: But even there, you watch Doctor Who, you watch something.

54:11.091 --> 54:14.934
[SPEAKER_05]: I download it off the internet, watch it at my convenience, and then go outside.

54:15.034 --> 54:17.376
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is some television you watch, at least one thing.

54:17.396 --> 54:18.577
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't use my television anymore.

54:18.597 --> 54:19.518
[SPEAKER_02]: And Torchwood, you watch that too.

54:19.558 --> 54:20.298
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need cable.

54:21.259 --> 54:27.584
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could, with the IPTV, you could set it, now granted you don't live in the UK, if there were any US shows that you watched, I mean I know they rebroadcast.

54:27.604 --> 54:28.245
[SPEAKER_02]: Heroes starts tomorrow.

54:28.265 --> 54:32.108
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing at all worth watching on television in the United States.

54:32.128 --> 54:33.890
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to watch Heroes tomorrow with Doctor Nine?

54:35.091 --> 54:36.672
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not actually, I'm going to be in school.

54:38.260 --> 54:39.361
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

55:05.999 --> 55:06.339
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

55:06.599 --> 55:06.859
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

55:07.079 --> 55:16.322
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if I got anything for TV, I'd definitely have a DVR, but other than that... Yeah, and then that's kind of what IPTV is, you know, DVR, video on demand, all that crap.

55:16.502 --> 55:22.023
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just don't think that... I don't think that we need anything else contributing to the couch potato mentality.

55:22.243 --> 55:24.484
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are... And there's educational things on TV.

55:24.504 --> 55:31.746
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck, over at Loki's last night, we were watching on Discovery Health this whole special on people going through transgender surgery, and there was this post-op chick...

55:32.432 --> 55:33.932
[SPEAKER_02]: JV Mon in chat says, IPTV seems unattractive to me.

55:33.952 --> 55:35.733
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I don't know enough about it yet.

55:35.773 --> 55:35.853
[SPEAKER_02]: Like,

55:54.964 --> 55:59.008
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize CES is kind of a very high-level thing for tech heads and things of that nature.

55:59.168 --> 56:07.215
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a brochure that's dumbed down for me to explain exactly what I'm going to have to change and what I'm going to have to pay to get this and why I should do it.

56:07.495 --> 56:09.457
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, for me, it comes down to the channels.

56:09.677 --> 56:17.944
[SPEAKER_02]: If it had some pretty good HD channels, because that's what my current cable provider is severely lacking, is we have like five HD channels, and there's way more out there.

56:18.365 --> 56:21.027
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's others out there, and HD is pretty good.

56:21.869 --> 56:23.830
[SPEAKER_02]: Raven's Dolphin agrees with the YouTube thing.

56:23.890 --> 56:24.771
[SPEAKER_02]: Long live YouTube.

56:25.931 --> 56:26.352
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

56:29.093 --> 56:29.673
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on.

56:31.675 --> 56:36.777
[SPEAKER_01]: We watched YouTube last night on the Wii.

56:38.118 --> 56:38.778
[SPEAKER_01]: Laser Cats.

56:39.659 --> 56:42.801
[SPEAKER_05]: We were watching Jesus Christ Supercop today on the Wii.

56:43.801 --> 56:44.782
[SPEAKER_02]: They were watching some...

56:45.801 --> 56:46.362
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

57:04.821 --> 57:14.984
[SPEAKER_05]: The assault rifle in Halo 3 is the MA-5C assault rifle that is a return of one that they removed from Halo 2.

57:15.224 --> 57:15.924
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't have in Halo 2.

57:17.165 --> 57:22.826
[SPEAKER_05]: The power level is going to be somewhere between the original one and the BR-55 battle rifle from Halo 2.

57:23.927 --> 57:26.788
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use the butt as a melee weapon apart from that.

57:27.268 --> 57:34.450
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a thing that I thought was very funny is how they described it was the MA-5C is built like a brick outhouse with Venetian blinds.

57:35.168 --> 57:36.028
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

58:05.157 --> 58:09.959
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I remembered there are those cutesy games that you are into that none of the rest of us have freaking heard of.

58:10.039 --> 58:11.540
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess there's that.

58:12.100 --> 58:16.481
[SPEAKER_05]: Halo really isn't, you know, the Halo franchise really isn't that bad.

58:17.242 --> 58:20.763
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that it's not my thing, you know.

58:21.503 --> 58:25.525
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's understandable because certainly I know a lot of people who aren't into Halo, which is another thing.

58:25.565 --> 58:27.606
[SPEAKER_02]: But me, I've been getting back into Halo too lately.

58:27.646 --> 58:28.826
[SPEAKER_05]: I did try.

58:29.747 --> 58:32.928
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if somebody I know is into a game...

58:33.610 --> 58:36.851
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it's worth playing once before I reserve my judgment for it.

58:37.831 --> 58:49.934
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have the same problem with that that I found out a long time ago that I have with Goldeneye, with almost any first-person shooter, that it makes me so motion sick that I can't... Katamari makes me motion sick.

58:50.334 --> 58:55.415
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it's on crack and has enough in it that makes me be able to stand playing a couple of games.

58:55.435 --> 58:56.435
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

58:57.216 --> 58:57.596
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

58:57.856 --> 59:02.997
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine how insane Katamari would be if the Sonic team was behind it?

59:04.520 --> 59:05.581
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be like super fast.

59:05.661 --> 59:06.941
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because they'd fuck it up.

59:07.101 --> 59:09.182
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right, you wouldn't be able to control it correctly.

59:09.283 --> 59:10.003
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

59:10.123 --> 59:11.184
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no.

59:11.784 --> 59:14.085
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that Sonic Team needs to, never mind.

59:14.205 --> 59:16.366
[SPEAKER_05]: The Sonic Team debate will go for another show.

59:17.227 --> 59:31.134
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywho, as if it's a huge surprise or anything, because I know it's not for me, the Halo 3 beta, since it's being included in Crackdown, well, they've sold about another 25% more of Crackdown than they would have normally had.

59:31.653 --> 59:33.254
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, big surprise there.

59:33.334 --> 59:36.717
[SPEAKER_01]: People aren't going to buy Crackdown just because of the Halo 3 beta in there.

59:37.698 --> 59:39.499
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, though, Crackdown's an awesome game.

59:39.719 --> 59:41.020
[SPEAKER_01]: The demo's coming out on Tuesday.

59:41.561 --> 59:44.023
[SPEAKER_01]: So I highly recommend checking it out if you have Xbox Live.

59:44.763 --> 59:45.524
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely worth it.

59:48.786 --> 59:56.172
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as Loki previously reported, Major Nelson confirmed that Crackdown demo will be hitting Xbox Live on Tuesday.

59:56.412 --> 59:56.673
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

59:56.733 --> 59:59.195
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki gets a big finger from me for stealing my story.

59:59.235 --> 59:59.655
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot.

01:00:00.273 --> 01:00:02.575
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out, Tuesday at 2 o'clock Pacific Time.

01:00:03.055 --> 01:00:07.780
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess I could take this opportunity to point out, he doesn't often announce demos in advance.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:14.906
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually they announce them once they've already hit, or news leaks out, and most Microsoft rumors are true anyway.

01:00:15.246 --> 01:00:16.287
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

01:00:17.288 --> 01:00:24.454
[SPEAKER_02]: But regardless, since I don't know much about Crackdown, but I keep hearing Loki rave about it, which is fascinating because he's never played it, I definitely want to check out the demo.

01:00:24.474 --> 01:00:27.597
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Grand Theft Auto, but here's why Crackdown's awesome.

01:00:28.442 --> 01:00:29.723
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you sleep with a hooker then shoot them?

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:53.166
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can sleep with hookers.

01:00:53.266 --> 01:00:53.986
[SPEAKER_02]: Not interested.

01:00:54.247 --> 01:00:57.129
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can probably throw hookers into buildings and that's just as cool.

01:00:57.369 --> 01:00:58.830
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now my interest is back.

01:00:58.850 --> 01:00:59.130
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:02.633
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got two-player co-op over live.

01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:03.874
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, alright.

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:04.574
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that would be fun.

01:01:04.714 --> 01:01:08.297
[SPEAKER_02]: I will check out the demo just for you, Loki, and give my thoughts on next week's edition.

01:01:08.317 --> 01:01:08.938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got multiplayer co-op.

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:09.858
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll play multiplayer.

01:01:11.159 --> 01:01:12.400
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, will the demo have multiplayer?

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:12.600
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:13.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sweet.

01:01:14.362 --> 01:01:15.042
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about that.

01:01:15.102 --> 01:01:16.223
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I throw you into a building?

01:01:16.243 --> 01:01:17.684
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've been wanting to do that for a long time.

01:01:17.824 --> 01:01:18.124
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

01:01:18.305 --> 01:01:18.805
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:01:19.425 --> 01:01:19.966
[SPEAKER_02]: Sign me up.

01:01:20.426 --> 01:01:21.547
[SPEAKER_02]: I should pre-order it tomorrow.

01:01:22.008 --> 01:01:24.110
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I can be in the Halo 3 beta like all the cool kids.

01:01:26.152 --> 01:01:29.074
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be in the cool kids club for lots of other things, Rob.

01:01:29.835 --> 01:01:30.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what?

01:01:31.456 --> 01:01:37.001
[SPEAKER_05]: Like your idea for getting fast passes while we were in the line for Space Mountain.

01:01:37.322 --> 01:01:38.202
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could ride it again?

01:01:38.222 --> 01:01:39.023
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could ride it again.

01:01:39.343 --> 01:01:41.866
[SPEAKER_05]: And then getting fast passes for when we go back for my birthday.

01:01:42.386 --> 01:01:42.927
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smart.

01:01:43.067 --> 01:01:43.767
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smart like that.

01:01:44.148 --> 01:01:46.530
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's some cool stuff.

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:56.695
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who is into Luminous Live, there will be three goodies coming out on Wednesday.

01:01:59.116 --> 01:02:05.918
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually three downloadable packages that are going to be available January 24th at 1 a.m.

01:02:05.978 --> 01:02:07.099
[SPEAKER_05]: Pacific time.

01:02:08.719 --> 01:02:15.482
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of them are add-on packs, and then there's one for free, but only for Xbox Live Gold members.

01:02:16.087 --> 01:02:17.467
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it would be the Heavenly Star Pack.

01:02:17.807 --> 01:02:24.329
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, which I am so... You know, I would get Luminous Live just to get the Heavenly Star Pack.

01:02:24.489 --> 01:02:32.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and this gives me another excuse to play this song on our little program here, a little clip from it, because I freaking love this song, and I think it's going to be awesome to play.

01:02:32.272 --> 01:02:33.512
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your fault I put it on my mic, Dave.

01:02:44.204 --> 01:02:49.408
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, somebody in chat is saying there's new Alpha Canogram says I want the new Genki Rockets remixes on iTunes.

01:02:49.488 --> 01:02:49.688
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

01:02:49.748 --> 01:02:49.948
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

01:02:50.449 --> 01:02:51.209
[SPEAKER_02]: I have iTunes open right now.

01:02:51.229 --> 01:02:52.010
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to look at that crap.

01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:53.851
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, show.

01:02:54.131 --> 01:02:55.852
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not see remixes on iTunes.

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:56.853
[SPEAKER_02]: This is lies.

01:02:57.474 --> 01:02:57.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Lies.

01:02:58.154 --> 01:02:59.475
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're in the UK store or something.

01:02:59.495 --> 01:02:59.755
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:03:00.776 --> 01:03:01.076
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:03:01.316 --> 01:03:01.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

01:03:01.576 --> 01:03:01.817
[SPEAKER_02]: Show.

01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:04.759
[SPEAKER_02]: I did want to go back and read some chat comments, some other things in chat.

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:15.040
[SPEAKER_02]: JeremyTodd1 was saying about the Crackdown demo, Loki, some people who have played it were saying it's more like Spider-Man 2 or that Hulk Ultimate Destruction game more than GTA.

01:03:16.142 --> 01:03:16.302
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

01:03:16.809 --> 01:03:19.050
[SPEAKER_02]: and Blaze says this is how the demo is going to go down.

01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:20.530
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki kills everything.

01:03:20.810 --> 01:03:22.070
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob goes and picks a flower.

01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:23.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, screw you, buddy.

01:03:23.391 --> 01:03:23.691
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

01:03:23.911 --> 01:03:24.351
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, no.

01:03:25.131 --> 01:03:25.271
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

01:03:25.671 --> 01:03:35.014
[SPEAKER_02]: When I played the Superman Returns demo, which the only thing I got a thrill out of in that demo was I went and I picked up a woman and then I flew to the beach and left her and I was like, bye, bitch.

01:03:35.314 --> 01:03:36.014
[SPEAKER_02]: I flew away.

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:40.636
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't think I can be sadistic in those types of games, you are way wrong.

01:03:40.656 --> 01:03:42.076
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the wrong impression of me, buddy.

01:03:42.276 --> 01:03:43.737
[SPEAKER_01]: You missed the best part in the game, though.

01:03:43.757 --> 01:03:48.059
[SPEAKER_01]: You pick up a car, and you fly really high, because you can't really, you know, blow up the car.

01:03:48.299 --> 01:03:51.381
[SPEAKER_01]: You could drop the car, though, and it just falls and explodes.

01:03:51.921 --> 01:03:52.201
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:54.282
[SPEAKER_02]: I should re-download the demo just to do that.

01:03:54.422 --> 01:03:55.023
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hilarious.

01:03:55.043 --> 01:03:58.684
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to buy the game, but I'll... Do you get achievements, maybe, for that?

01:03:58.725 --> 01:04:00.345
[SPEAKER_02]: Because maybe I could, like, gamefly it.

01:04:00.465 --> 01:04:02.767
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get a gamefly account, or one of those companies.

01:04:02.787 --> 01:04:03.447
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'll go with them.

01:04:03.467 --> 01:04:04.407
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a horrible, horrible game.

01:04:04.447 --> 01:04:07.349
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, one game that's not so horrible, although...

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:08.940
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom Boom Rocket

01:04:38.544 --> 01:04:40.185
[SPEAKER_01]: and hopefully it'll be downloadable soon.

01:04:41.965 --> 01:04:42.505
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

01:04:42.585 --> 01:04:45.206
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks pretty cool from the screenshots I've seen of it so far.

01:04:46.787 --> 01:04:47.647
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks pretty sexy.

01:04:47.847 --> 01:04:48.207
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

01:04:49.788 --> 01:04:51.088
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it just looks like Fantavision.

01:04:51.748 --> 01:04:53.069
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's actual screenshots of it now?

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:56.150
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks just like Fantavision and kind of like DDR.

01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:58.490
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it does look kind of like DDR.

01:04:58.610 --> 01:04:59.491
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jamie can't see.

01:04:59.511 --> 01:05:00.431
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that looks fun.

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:01.611
[SPEAKER_02]: Show it to Jamie.

01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:02.032
[SPEAKER_02]: She can't see.

01:05:03.372 --> 01:05:04.452
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, explodey.

01:05:04.872 --> 01:05:06.313
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Miklatov's excited about this?

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:10.964
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Fantavision, I think I'm the only person in the world who got the biggest kick out of it.

01:05:11.004 --> 01:05:11.825
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have Fantavision.

01:05:12.025 --> 01:05:12.725
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best.

01:05:12.905 --> 01:05:16.908
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the best launch title, and that looks just like it, and I can't wait now.

01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:33.418
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does look like DDR, because there's like this kind of a purple line towards the top of the screen, and there's actual, looks like the bursts from the fireworks going up, instead of maybe clicking on them or whatever, they have arrows on them, so I think you have to

01:05:34.608 --> 01:05:39.912
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe point in the direction of the arrow or something, kind of like DDR, and it'll blow them up in time.

01:05:40.252 --> 01:05:40.833
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my guess.

01:05:41.193 --> 01:05:42.053
[SPEAKER_02]: JV Mon called it.

01:05:42.073 --> 01:05:43.835
[SPEAKER_02]: JV Mon said, that will make Miklatov happy.

01:05:45.096 --> 01:05:46.777
[SPEAKER_02]: You must talk to him a lot offline or something.

01:05:48.098 --> 01:05:48.438
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:05:48.838 --> 01:05:51.000
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, before we get to the next story, I just want to point this out.

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.822
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to do a quick follow-up here on the last story.

01:05:54.883 --> 01:06:03.589
[SPEAKER_02]: What I thought was interesting is that somebody pointed me to the MySpace for Genkai Rockets, who does Heavenly Star, and apparently it is announced on there that

01:06:03.945 --> 01:06:08.450
[SPEAKER_02]: that there will be five different remixes of Heavenly Star coming soon.

01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:09.170
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a clip.

01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:10.071
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming this is one of them.

01:06:13.855 --> 01:06:15.436
Tokyo Hot 100.

01:06:15.557 --> 01:06:17.038
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is some radio clip.

01:06:17.058 --> 01:06:18.139
This is number 27 on 81.3.

01:06:18.179 --> 01:06:19.961
[SPEAKER_00]: Genki Rockets, Heavenly Star.

01:06:29.188 --> 01:06:29.789
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, forget it.

01:06:29.809 --> 01:06:31.050
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just some clip from the radio.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.290
[SPEAKER_02]: Why'd they put that on their MySpace?

01:06:32.531 --> 01:06:33.351
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would they put that?

01:06:33.371 --> 01:06:34.592
[SPEAKER_02]: Live radio, boys and girls.

01:06:34.632 --> 01:06:36.474
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I didn't know what I was clicking on.

01:06:36.514 --> 01:06:40.597
[SPEAKER_02]: They do say on the MySpace, it's written here, five different remixes of Heavenly Star coming soon.

01:06:42.338 --> 01:06:42.618
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

01:06:42.638 --> 01:06:43.219
[SPEAKER_01]: Why what, Loki?

01:06:43.539 --> 01:06:46.641
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would they put that clip from a radio show?

01:06:46.681 --> 01:06:49.343
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they want to show that Genkai Rockets is awesome.

01:06:49.683 --> 01:06:52.125
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why don't they put an MP3 copy of it or something?

01:06:52.145 --> 01:06:55.308
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, something that doesn't sound like recorded off radio.

01:06:55.468 --> 01:06:55.588
[SPEAKER_02]: Could...

01:06:56.511 --> 01:06:58.193
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think we could get Genkai Rockets on the show?

01:06:58.213 --> 01:06:59.254
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think they speak English?

01:07:01.077 --> 01:07:01.417
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

01:07:02.458 --> 01:07:03.580
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to fire off an email.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:04.841
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to send them a message on MySpace.

01:07:05.201 --> 01:07:05.942
[SPEAKER_02]: They sing in English.

01:07:06.042 --> 01:07:06.523
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.

01:07:06.963 --> 01:07:07.544
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

01:07:08.325 --> 01:07:08.565
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:07:09.286 --> 01:07:09.827
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway.

01:07:12.199 --> 01:07:12.599
[SPEAKER_02]: www.darksakura.com

01:07:34.935 --> 01:08:01.327
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero franchise is now moving over to the Neversoft branch who makes Tony Hawk's Project 8 and this is confirmed by a screenshot from Neversoft's website where you see Guitar Hero side by side with Tony Hawk's Project 8 so it does look like now Guitar Hero 3 will be developed by this Neversoft company so apparently now this frees up Harmonix to work on a rumored sequel to Frequency and Aplitude but as we learned about on a previous program

01:08:02.398 --> 01:08:07.044
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going to put one out on the PSP and it got, I guess, canned.

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:08.425
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what they're working on now.

01:08:08.445 --> 01:08:09.307
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be top secret.

01:08:10.308 --> 01:08:10.628
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:18.138
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there is actually something interesting going on, though.

01:08:18.218 --> 01:08:19.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Activision registered trademarks.

01:08:20.828 --> 01:08:24.691
[SPEAKER_05]: for two new games, Guitar Villain and Drum Villain.

01:08:25.712 --> 01:08:36.443
[SPEAKER_05]: The applications are stating that they're both the same thing, computer game software, downloadable software for use in connection with computer games, entertainment services.

01:08:38.284 --> 01:08:42.949
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to me that I think that they're really going to be expanding the franchise.

01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:53.897
[SPEAKER_05]: And both of those applications also said that they'd be using toy guitars for video games, toys designed to be used for computer games or video games.

01:08:56.199 --> 01:08:57.320
[SPEAKER_05]: The drum one sounds interesting.

01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:01.864
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking, you know, sort of like what session mode was for Drum Mania.

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:13.013
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, you know, we need to keep in mind, in April last year, Red Octane placed applications to trademark Drum Hero and Keyboard Hero.

01:09:13.713 --> 01:09:14.014
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

01:09:15.558 --> 01:09:16.700
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen anything from those yet.

01:09:17.181 --> 01:09:18.543
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but it could be.

01:09:18.803 --> 01:09:29.320
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is interesting that, you know, Konami, who did the, you know, Bimani series, had a Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Keyboard Mania, so it's almost kind of...

01:09:30.137 --> 01:09:31.698
[SPEAKER_02]: Mirror Image.

01:09:31.798 --> 01:09:35.940
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll win their awards for Drum Hero and Keyboard Hero and Band Hero or whatever else.

01:09:36.581 --> 01:09:38.942
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so innovative.

01:09:38.962 --> 01:09:40.283
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen that before.

01:09:40.323 --> 01:09:41.363
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

01:09:41.683 --> 01:09:43.624
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami abandoned keyboard mania.

01:09:43.724 --> 01:09:46.226
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, I am all about bringing on the Keyboard Hero.

01:09:46.446 --> 01:09:46.946
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

01:09:46.986 --> 01:09:47.426
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

01:09:47.546 --> 01:09:49.608
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play Jump.

01:09:49.688 --> 01:09:56.011
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can put Jump in Keyboard Hero, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

01:09:56.111 --> 01:09:57.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me not everybody would want to play that.

01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:59.831
[SPEAKER_05]: Session Van Halen

01:10:18.072 --> 01:10:19.153
[SPEAKER_01]: Come out and try to say it's original.

01:10:19.493 --> 01:10:30.741
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's good about music games, though, the sales have been up about 80%, probably due to the fact of Guitar Hero 2 coming out, since it was, I think, one of the top-selling games in December.

01:10:32.022 --> 01:10:43.991
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a huge surprise, but a lot of people are starting to actually look at music games as possibly a way to get their music heard, including some quotes from...

01:10:44.912 --> 01:10:45.713
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

01:11:06.431 --> 01:11:08.112
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really that much innovation going on.

01:11:08.453 --> 01:11:18.220
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say as much as I love and adore Konami for bringing over Beatmania and DDR, I think this kind of proves they didn't put enough faith in it in the beginning.

01:11:18.721 --> 01:11:22.364
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that the games have taken off, other people are getting the credit for it in a way.

01:11:22.424 --> 01:11:32.092
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously the guitar game has been reinvented since then, but I think Konami might be kicking themselves a little bit for not taking a bigger risk and bringing more of those games over here a few years ago.

01:11:32.112 --> 01:11:33.773
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm really surprised that

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:39.522
[SPEAKER_01]: with Guitar Hero's success that they haven't jumped to try to bring drum here.

01:11:40.102 --> 01:11:40.643
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it time.

01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:41.464
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know what might happen.

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:42.484
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

01:11:45.227 --> 01:11:46.188
[SPEAKER_02]: We will see, I guess.

01:11:46.208 --> 01:11:52.793
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, supposedly they're having a big press conference pretty soon, Konami, and apparently we get to go, so we'll have all the latest for you.

01:11:52.953 --> 01:11:53.674
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently.

01:11:53.714 --> 01:11:54.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.

01:11:55.075 --> 01:11:56.196
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we don't get turned down.

01:11:56.636 --> 01:12:03.222
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have all the latest for you guys here on this program when that happens, which is in a couple weeks.

01:12:04.515 --> 01:12:17.043
[SPEAKER_02]: Talkin' now about the Wii a little bit, because, you know, one reason that people play dance games is to lose weight, and one thing that has people excited about the Wii is it's got you up and movin' around, so can you really lose weight playing the Wii?

01:12:17.403 --> 01:12:20.005
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, my kind of reaction when I saw it was like, well, not a lot.

01:12:20.025 --> 01:12:21.185
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not doing that much motion.

01:12:21.205 --> 01:12:24.387
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not supposed to do these grand, huge motions.

01:12:24.407 --> 01:12:27.409
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only supposed to do little motions with your hand and all that stuff.

01:12:27.429 --> 01:12:32.292
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this website did this Wii Sports Experiment thing,

01:12:32.992 --> 01:12:38.635
[SPEAKER_02]: and apparently what they've done here is that they did a 30 day trial of playing the game.

01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:45.598
[SPEAKER_02]: They ran, I think they played for 30 days for 30 minutes and the dude lost like 10 pounds.

01:12:46.018 --> 01:12:46.978
[SPEAKER_01]: Without changing any diet.

01:12:46.998 --> 01:12:47.999
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm sorry, it was six weeks.

01:12:48.219 --> 01:12:53.401
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't change any diet or nothing and in 30 minutes of Wii Sports a day, he lost 10 pounds.

01:12:54.569 --> 01:12:57.532
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that's just probably more a result of being more active in general.

01:12:57.712 --> 01:13:02.136
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of, you know, getting the body moving and waking up the muscles and things probably a little bit.

01:13:02.296 --> 01:13:02.997
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably it.

01:13:03.037 --> 01:13:04.678
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just an increase in activity.

01:13:05.519 --> 01:13:09.282
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, it would be, I would consider a low impact aerobic.

01:13:10.043 --> 01:13:11.824
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, which is, it's better than nothing.

01:13:12.245 --> 01:13:12.425
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:13:12.545 --> 01:13:14.667
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, cool on that.

01:13:15.207 --> 01:13:17.309
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably something I need to go on because, you know.

01:13:18.154 --> 01:13:18.854
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to quit my gym.

01:13:19.075 --> 01:13:20.535
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gained a little weight lately.

01:13:20.595 --> 01:13:21.216
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to lose it.

01:13:21.316 --> 01:13:22.816
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I'll go on the weed diet as well.

01:13:23.217 --> 01:13:27.479
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, WarioWare has kind of a mode in it that is encouraging the whole weight loss thing.

01:13:27.859 --> 01:13:33.022
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a mode that is nothing but games that require big movements.

01:13:33.602 --> 01:13:35.803
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's supposed to be a game that really gets you moving around.

01:13:35.823 --> 01:13:37.024
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just need to play more DDR.

01:13:37.064 --> 01:13:38.104
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to go to the gym.

01:13:38.485 --> 01:13:39.965
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do need to just go to the gym.

01:13:40.045 --> 01:13:41.726
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know my thing with gyms.

01:13:41.746 --> 01:13:42.507
[SPEAKER_02]: Gyms are weird places.

01:13:42.527 --> 01:13:44.548
[SPEAKER_05]: You can come with me and Extra for on Tuesday.

01:13:44.728 --> 01:13:45.348
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll think about it.

01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:46.569
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk off air.

01:13:47.717 --> 01:13:48.598
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll have a play date.

01:13:48.618 --> 01:13:48.938
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

01:13:50.239 --> 01:13:52.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Only if we get to... Never mind.

01:13:52.601 --> 01:13:56.224
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get to go out for ice cream afterwards.

01:13:56.304 --> 01:13:58.146
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's get ice cream after the job.

01:13:58.386 --> 01:13:59.127
[SPEAKER_05]: That works for me.

01:13:59.247 --> 01:14:00.628
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the kind of reward I need.

01:14:01.169 --> 01:14:01.469
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:14:01.569 --> 01:14:07.494
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, one reward we like to give our listeners is reading the stuff they have to write to us on air.

01:14:08.014 --> 01:14:10.456
[SPEAKER_02]: And tonight we have our lovely mailbag segment.

01:14:10.857 --> 01:14:15.861
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura reads the emails that you send to her at mailbag at orangelaunceradio.com live here on the air.

01:14:16.192 --> 01:14:18.734
[SPEAKER_02]: and I believe we probably have an Uber mailbag segment tonight, don't we?

01:14:18.754 --> 01:14:19.355
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably have a lot.

01:14:19.475 --> 01:14:19.815
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:14:20.235 --> 01:14:20.756
[SPEAKER_05]: Decent.

01:14:21.216 --> 01:14:23.258
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I got rid of the spam, we had a few.

01:14:23.418 --> 01:14:23.678
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:14:24.038 --> 01:14:29.082
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's get to some emails because I know we probably missed a few while we were out and I want to hear what the folks had to say.

01:14:29.523 --> 01:14:31.264
[SPEAKER_02]: So, DarkSakura, who emailed us?

01:14:32.945 --> 01:14:35.087
[SPEAKER_05]: First email of the night was from Rini.

01:14:36.328 --> 01:14:37.109
[SPEAKER_05]: Salutations.

01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:39.050
[SPEAKER_05]: I love when an email starts with salutations.

01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:39.731
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just awesome.

01:14:40.532 --> 01:14:44.735
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen to your last two podcasts of 2006 and would like to respond to some items of interest.

01:14:45.410 --> 01:15:10.614
[SPEAKER_05]: on your Christmas Eve episode someone asked why iTunes keeps inexplicably stopping downloads as much as it pisses me off as well the only remedy I can offer to iTunes users when you're downloading a podcast make sure that not only is iTunes in the front most or active application but that you keep iTunes in its downloads feature up front as well you do this by starting a download in iTunes choosing downloads on the sidebar to the left of the iTunes window okay

01:15:11.723 --> 01:15:25.707
[SPEAKER_05]: Since iTunes is already being pissy enough as it is, if you end up with an incomplete podcast, delete the incomplete file, go onto the podcast section of iTunes and click on the Orange Dodge Radio item, the one with the gray iTunes window, click unsubscribe, and then click subscribe.

01:15:26.187 --> 01:15:33.330
[SPEAKER_05]: After you've recovered from doing all that, iTunes will have refreshed the list of all shows from the feed and immediately start downloading the latest show automatically.

01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:34.610
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's also great about that?

01:15:35.151 --> 01:15:39.274
[SPEAKER_02]: The more people that click subscribe, the higher our ranking goes on iTunes.

01:15:39.834 --> 01:15:43.037
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, inadvertently helping the station out, so I love this tactic.

01:15:43.317 --> 01:15:44.278
[SPEAKER_02]: Kudos to Remy.

01:15:45.679 --> 01:15:50.682
[SPEAKER_05]: Regarding your end of the year show, I would like to say that Scott Rubin was quite pissed that he wasn't invited.

01:15:51.523 --> 01:15:51.963
[SPEAKER_05]: Rebuttal?

01:15:52.764 --> 01:15:54.125
[SPEAKER_05]: He would have been a great guest.

01:15:55.986 --> 01:16:03.532
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Scott, I left the message on Scott's Xbox Live friends list, and he defriended me, so his loss.

01:16:04.955 --> 01:16:05.636
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

01:16:07.037 --> 01:16:22.891
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we picked the people we did is we wanted to get a mix of people that we have on the show a lot, like Bobby, and people we hadn't had on the show before, but respected, like VGO and Gamertag Radio and those other things.

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:26.394
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott knows he's welcome on the show anytime he wants.

01:16:26.434 --> 01:16:30.658
[SPEAKER_02]: So Scott, if you're still feeling butthurt about not being on the show, send us an email.

01:16:30.678 --> 01:16:31.338
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to have you on.

01:16:31.659 --> 01:16:31.959
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime.

01:16:32.967 --> 01:16:40.953
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, I don't believe it was reported on OLR, but the classic CD-ROM trivia game You Don't Know Jack semi-returns in web form at YouDon'tKnowJack.com.

01:16:41.433 --> 01:16:44.875
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, questions only come in the form of Dis or Dat minigames.

01:16:45.376 --> 01:16:49.178
[SPEAKER_05]: The best parts are that a new Dis or Dat is available daily holidays, too.

01:16:49.759 --> 01:16:54.302
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the original hosts, I mean, Cookie?

01:16:55.203 --> 01:16:56.083
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Cookie.

01:16:57.044 --> 01:16:59.766
[SPEAKER_05]: Curiously, the site is also in beta form.

01:17:00.643 --> 01:17:02.764
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a happy new year and keep on going, Rini.

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:05.006
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, moving forward, we have one from AZHP.

01:17:22.185 --> 01:17:28.170
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, all we're talking about Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun, and the possibility of RS2 on 360.

01:17:29.471 --> 01:17:38.718
[SPEAKER_05]: Just having gotten Ikaruga as a Christmas present for my girlfriend, I wanted to know what other games has Treasure made, especially games that were on systems in the realm of virtual console games.

01:17:39.218 --> 01:17:43.201
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my Wii, and I'm an absolute VC game whore.

01:17:43.861 --> 01:17:47.164
[SPEAKER_05]: Not because I played the games in my youth, I'm 18 and in college.

01:17:47.506 --> 01:17:52.390
[SPEAKER_05]: but because my paltry $4 a week allowance didn't allow me to buy many $70 games in my youth.

01:17:52.910 --> 01:18:07.301
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, Virtual Console is a haven for Shrump fans as I have Gunstar Heroes, Superstar Soldiers, Soldier Blade, and R-Type and love them all and I'm eagerly anticipating downloading Gradius as soon as I load up more points.

01:18:07.682 --> 01:18:12.025
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, what treasure games are there that could possibly make their way to Virtual Console?

01:18:12.425 --> 01:18:13.606
[SPEAKER_05]: Eagerly awaiting an answer.

01:18:14.387 --> 01:18:15.427
[SPEAKER_05]: Sincerely, AZHP.

01:18:15.728 --> 01:18:17.269
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually emailed back

01:18:17.944 --> 01:18:25.168
[SPEAKER_05]: with a list and give me a second and I will definitely pull up the list that I did.

01:18:27.209 --> 01:18:29.910
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here are the list of games that Treasure has made.

01:18:31.171 --> 01:18:33.452
[SPEAKER_05]: For Arcadius, Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun.

01:18:34.065 --> 01:18:46.854
[SPEAKER_05]: Dreamcast was Bongayo, Ikaruga, Game Boy Advance was Advanced Guardian Heroes, Astro Boy Omega Factor, Gunstar Superheroes, Hajime no Ippo, The Fighting, Tiny Toon Adventures, Buster's Bad Dream, I just totally don't see that coming out on Virtual Console.

01:18:47.454 --> 01:19:03.705
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Boy Color was Tiny Toon Adventures, Dizzy's Candy Quest, Game Gear was Dynamite Headdy, Gunstar Heroes, GameCube was Dragon Drive, D-Master Shot, Ikaruga, Wario World, Genesis Alien Soldier, Dynamite Headdy, Gunstar Heroes, Light Crusader, McDonald's Treasureland Adventure, which I totally don't see coming on Virtual Console.

01:19:04.285 --> 01:19:07.827
[SPEAKER_05]: and Yu Yu Hakusho, Makyo, Toitsusen, sorry.

01:19:08.908 --> 01:19:11.389
[SPEAKER_05]: And then IQ, Sin and Punishment, Successor to the Earth.

01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:12.950
[SPEAKER_05]: Master System had Dynamite Headdy.

01:19:13.891 --> 01:19:15.192
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo 64 was Buckret.

01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:16.393
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a bunch that came out.

01:19:16.613 --> 01:19:18.734
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, Mission Makers, Bangaio.

01:19:18.774 --> 01:19:19.875
[SPEAKER_05]: We had some Bleach games.

01:19:21.255 --> 01:19:23.337
[SPEAKER_05]: Rakugaki Showtime, Silhouette Mirage.

01:19:24.557 --> 01:19:26.259
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, the games that I see coming out...

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:37.265
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that if they start expanding past the 16-bit era, which I kind of hope that they do, we might start seeing some of the Saturn 2D ones out.

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:40.807
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see Radiant Silvergun and Guardian Heroes and Silhouette Mirage coming out.

01:19:40.827 --> 01:19:43.029
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really think we get Saturn games on Virtual Console?

01:19:43.409 --> 01:19:43.549
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

01:19:43.569 --> 01:19:45.810
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really think we get Saturn games on Virtual Console?

01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:46.390
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why not.

01:19:48.612 --> 01:19:49.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's shaking his head no.

01:19:49.572 --> 01:19:50.753
[SPEAKER_05]: The 2D ones, I don't see why not.

01:19:50.773 --> 01:19:51.073
[SPEAKER_02]: Too big.

01:19:51.193 --> 01:19:51.653
[SPEAKER_02]: I think too big.

01:19:51.913 --> 01:19:54.535
[SPEAKER_02]: Too big and the thing downloads as slow as shit as it is.

01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:58.911
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't see why we wouldn't get some of the sprite-based ones.

01:19:59.051 --> 01:20:04.834
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe on, I'm going to say it here and now, I bet you anything in the next three years, Nintendo announces a Wii HD.

01:20:05.014 --> 01:20:06.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe on the Wii HD.

01:20:06.615 --> 01:20:10.377
[SPEAKER_05]: But I totally see us getting something like Mischief Makers.

01:20:11.038 --> 01:20:17.481
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally see, you know, Dynamite Headdy, a bunch of the other ones coming out.

01:20:17.561 --> 01:20:19.402
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really see why not.

01:20:19.783 --> 01:20:23.925
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not just for size, I think that it could definitely handle it.

01:20:25.515 --> 01:20:27.036
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 makes a good point.

01:20:27.116 --> 01:20:31.758
[SPEAKER_02]: Soundtracks will raise the file size, because if it uses Redbook Audio, then that's... Why would it use Redbook Audio?

01:20:32.338 --> 01:20:32.658
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they?

01:20:32.718 --> 01:20:33.058
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:20:33.119 --> 01:20:34.439
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't some Saturn games use it?

01:20:34.479 --> 01:20:41.062
[SPEAKER_05]: Only some did, and then they started moving in toward the other... I can't remember off the top of my head.

01:20:41.682 --> 01:20:43.283
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:20:43.663 --> 01:20:45.744
[SPEAKER_05]: Some games you can fully put in and just listen to, but...

01:20:46.357 --> 01:20:47.478
[SPEAKER_05]: They started moving away from that.

01:20:47.638 --> 01:20:52.841
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Second Mix, I remember, was just randomly some game I'm thinking of off the top of my head, like the PlayStation DDR game.

01:20:53.001 --> 01:20:53.842
[SPEAKER_05]: The first DDR, yeah.

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:56.523
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you could put it in a regular CD player and hear the songs.

01:20:56.583 --> 01:20:57.204
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a soundtrack.

01:20:57.704 --> 01:20:59.345
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:20:59.885 --> 01:21:04.088
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot more games started moving past that, though, for compression.

01:21:04.108 --> 01:21:12.773
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that if they were able to get some sort of increased storage capability for the Wii, I think we could totally start seeing...

01:21:15.691 --> 01:21:18.212
[SPEAKER_05]: and other later generation system games.

01:21:18.993 --> 01:21:19.633
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why not.

01:21:19.673 --> 01:21:20.834
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it could fully handle it.

01:21:21.494 --> 01:21:21.954
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see.

01:21:23.735 --> 01:21:24.255
[SPEAKER_02]: Not this year.

01:21:25.336 --> 01:21:28.157
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just glad to see that other people like Treasure, because I love Treasure.

01:21:30.459 --> 01:21:35.761
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, next email, we have one coming from Nike.

01:21:36.742 --> 01:21:38.343
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, OLR, I'm here again.

01:21:38.683 --> 01:21:40.784
[SPEAKER_05]: Got quite a lot to say, but I'll try to keep it short.

01:21:41.591 --> 01:21:42.472
[SPEAKER_05]: What's an MMO?

01:21:42.632 --> 01:21:44.433
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it like a World of Warcraft style game?

01:21:44.553 --> 01:21:48.115
[SPEAKER_05]: MMO is Massively Multiplayer Online.

01:21:49.356 --> 01:21:52.357
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean MMORPG, Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplay Game.

01:21:52.878 --> 01:21:55.879
[SPEAKER_05]: MMO means Massively Multiplayer Online.

01:21:56.139 --> 01:22:00.622
[SPEAKER_02]: Which basically means you're playing with hundreds of people or thousands of people at once instead of just two or three.

01:22:01.322 --> 01:22:01.823
[SPEAKER_02]: All online.

01:22:01.863 --> 01:22:02.723
[SPEAKER_02]: You're all in like a world.

01:22:02.743 --> 01:22:04.044
[SPEAKER_02]: They're usually world type games.

01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:09.527
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking on the HMV UK website, they're saying they're selling Excite Truck.

01:22:10.243 --> 01:22:12.324
[SPEAKER_05]: for pre-order for February for 50 pounds.

01:22:12.404 --> 01:22:15.485
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nearly $100 a disc and case in some paper.

01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:16.405
[SPEAKER_05]: What a rip-off.

01:22:16.705 --> 01:22:17.526
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, no, it's really fun.

01:22:18.826 --> 01:22:20.667
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I wouldn't pay $100 for it.

01:22:20.707 --> 01:22:20.947
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

01:22:22.147 --> 01:22:23.648
[SPEAKER_05]: C, what kind of music do you lot like?

01:22:24.328 --> 01:22:26.949
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie mentioned ASH, which is number one of my favorites.

01:22:27.009 --> 01:22:32.111
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob also mentioned the music from Elite Beat Agents, which has stuff like Sum 41.

01:22:33.271 --> 01:22:35.232
[SPEAKER_05]: Me, my favorite bands are Gorillaz and Payne.

01:22:37.105 --> 01:22:39.447
[SPEAKER_02]: Actual bands or video game music?

01:22:39.807 --> 01:22:41.148
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just picking music.

01:22:41.168 --> 01:22:49.273
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when it comes to video game music, I love all the stuff that Mizuguchi is a part of, like Space Channel 5 and Luminous and all that stuff is awesome.

01:22:50.674 --> 01:22:52.595
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Nobuo Imatsu.

01:22:53.396 --> 01:22:56.738
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to real music, which I know sounds so horrible.

01:22:56.758 --> 01:22:57.919
[SPEAKER_05]: I love listening to trancy stuff.

01:22:57.939 --> 01:22:58.399
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes.

01:22:58.419 --> 01:22:59.800
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on what I'm in the mood for.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.961
[SPEAKER_02]: And shoes.

01:23:02.822 --> 01:23:04.242
[SPEAKER_02]: What have I been listening to a lot lately?

01:23:04.283 --> 01:23:04.903
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know.

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.481
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that Icelandic?

01:23:08.462 --> 01:23:08.823
[SPEAKER_02]: Bjork?

01:23:09.063 --> 01:23:09.303
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:23:09.723 --> 01:23:10.264
[SPEAKER_02]: Roixop.

01:23:10.304 --> 01:23:10.824
[SPEAKER_02]: I like them.

01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:11.384
[SPEAKER_02]: They're cool.

01:23:11.585 --> 01:23:12.005
[SPEAKER_05]: They're cool.

01:23:12.105 --> 01:23:12.565
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like them.

01:23:13.466 --> 01:23:15.107
[SPEAKER_05]: I also like Death Metal.

01:23:17.489 --> 01:23:17.729
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

01:23:18.009 --> 01:23:18.390
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you do.

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:20.551
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like Gwar.

01:23:20.691 --> 01:23:24.254
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I've been listening to, really weirdly, I've been listening to a lot of Morrissey lately.

01:23:25.135 --> 01:23:28.858
[SPEAKER_05]: Mainly, you know, because Morrissey was our emo when we didn't have emo.

01:23:29.178 --> 01:23:30.019
[SPEAKER_02]: I love synth pop.

01:23:30.139 --> 01:23:30.879
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been my big thing.

01:23:30.919 --> 01:23:34.522
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever since DDR Ultramix 2 really got me into synth pop, like Echo Image and all that crap.

01:23:34.895 --> 01:23:35.215
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

01:23:35.355 --> 01:23:35.996
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't get enough of it.

01:23:37.496 --> 01:23:39.958
[SPEAKER_05]: Dee, you don't have the Nintendo Point Store in the U.S., do you?

01:23:41.539 --> 01:23:42.579
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they still working on that?

01:23:42.619 --> 01:23:43.300
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't looked.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:43.940
[SPEAKER_01]: A what?

01:23:44.581 --> 01:23:45.761
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo Point Store.

01:23:46.682 --> 01:23:48.062
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't have that in the U.S.

01:23:48.863 --> 01:23:49.884
[SPEAKER_05]: The channel was there.

01:23:50.224 --> 01:24:00.409
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the Point Store, what they're talking about, it's basically kind of like what they have for the Nintendo Club, I think, in Japan, where you buy titles and you earn points or stars.

01:24:00.429 --> 01:24:01.850
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're all pissed we don't have it.

01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:03.111
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, we don't have it.

01:24:05.176 --> 01:24:09.097
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, why doesn't Nintendo partner with voiceover IP like Skype?

01:24:09.437 --> 01:24:10.898
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wiimote has a speaker plus mic.

01:24:11.198 --> 01:24:11.958
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it just has a speaker.

01:24:12.198 --> 01:24:15.139
[SPEAKER_01]: Why doesn't Nintendo actually have some online games for the Wii yet?

01:24:15.919 --> 01:24:20.040
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's because for some reason they feel they need to roll it out slowly.

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:20.920
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whatever.

01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:21.661
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their strategy.

01:24:21.681 --> 01:24:26.082
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow they feel they're ahead in innovation in some parts and they're really behind in other parts.

01:24:26.222 --> 01:24:26.962
[SPEAKER_01]: So, whatever.

01:24:28.122 --> 01:24:30.583
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these questions I think we've actually already answered before.

01:24:32.057 --> 01:24:37.380
[SPEAKER_05]: And so skipping through, I'm going to say, what does all our team think of renting games?

01:24:38.661 --> 01:24:39.561
[SPEAKER_05]: Good way to test them out.

01:24:40.001 --> 01:24:42.383
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something I should be doing that I'm not, honestly.

01:24:42.963 --> 01:24:47.366
[SPEAKER_02]: I should be using that Gamefly or comparable type service, and I'm not.

01:24:47.906 --> 01:24:48.827
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to look into that.

01:24:49.267 --> 01:24:52.109
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe I would have avoided buying Red Steel.

01:24:52.689 --> 01:24:53.709
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an interesting question.

01:24:54.090 --> 01:24:56.030
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you go about getting a job in the game industry?

01:24:56.150 --> 01:25:00.212
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering as I have many career paths open for me at the moment, including being a doctor.

01:25:01.773 --> 01:25:02.973
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you just chance into it.

01:25:02.993 --> 01:25:07.835
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a friend who was a math major who now is a programmer for a company in the Bay Area.

01:25:07.975 --> 01:25:09.776
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Shane, you kind of work in the game industry.

01:25:09.816 --> 01:25:10.656
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you get your job?

01:25:11.912 --> 01:25:12.472
[SPEAKER_03]: Accident.

01:25:13.333 --> 01:25:13.613
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

01:25:13.933 --> 01:25:16.714
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just, whoops, now I work at a game company.

01:25:16.874 --> 01:25:20.555
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on people you know or if you look at Craigslist.

01:25:21.115 --> 01:25:25.837
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of video game companies post entry-level positions there all the time.

01:25:26.377 --> 01:25:29.018
[SPEAKER_02]: But you really have to be in an area where there's game companies.

01:25:29.118 --> 01:25:29.358
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:25:29.978 --> 01:25:32.879
[SPEAKER_03]: Or your skill needs to be high in demand.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:35.900
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you live in Wichita, Kansas, no offense, Shane.

01:25:36.701 --> 01:25:37.361
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you used to live.

01:25:37.994 --> 01:25:41.316
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live there, then you're probably not going to find a whole lot of gaming jobs.

01:25:41.356 --> 01:25:43.137
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I got my job.

01:25:43.177 --> 01:25:45.199
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you're here in California, aren't you?

01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:47.880
[SPEAKER_02]: It's best if you live where?

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.201
[SPEAKER_02]: Bay Area, L.A.?

01:25:49.721 --> 01:25:51.282
[SPEAKER_03]: Wherever the major game companies are.

01:25:51.322 --> 01:25:56.986
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got Washington, the Redmond area, and then you've got the Bay Area, and then you've got L.A.

01:25:57.606 --> 01:25:59.927
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where you want to go for the major ones.

01:26:01.248 --> 01:26:07.132
[SPEAKER_02]: The reality is, though, if you're sitting there thinking, I've got a great idea for a video game.

01:26:07.152 --> 01:26:07.412
[SPEAKER_05]: Wisconsin.

01:26:08.707 --> 01:26:10.288
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they have the one company there.

01:26:10.529 --> 01:26:15.852
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, because I was thinking about Megzi.

01:26:15.872 --> 01:26:18.814
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of major metros have at least one.

01:26:18.854 --> 01:26:23.737
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind that the industry, though, is very, very diverse.

01:26:24.357 --> 01:26:26.798
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be an artist, get in as a designer.

01:26:27.059 --> 01:26:28.439
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be a writer.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:32.622
[SPEAKER_05]: I was asked if I was interested in writing game manuals.

01:26:33.374 --> 01:26:36.937
[SPEAKER_05]: and part of why I was going to school was to actually do manuals.

01:26:36.957 --> 01:26:37.877
[SPEAKER_05]: Why'd you turn that down?

01:26:38.358 --> 01:26:38.938
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't turn it down.

01:26:39.279 --> 01:26:40.860
[SPEAKER_05]: I called on it and didn't hear anything.

01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:43.502
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was actually for writing strategy guides.

01:26:43.602 --> 01:26:45.443
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to hear that.

01:26:45.523 --> 01:26:46.924
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in school to do what I want to do.

01:26:46.944 --> 01:26:48.185
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be a massage therapist.

01:26:48.826 --> 01:26:55.551
[SPEAKER_05]: I could freaking be an independent contractor for a video game company giving massages during people's lunch.

01:26:56.437 --> 01:26:57.177
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac Bell does that.

01:26:57.758 --> 01:26:59.238
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of major companies do.

01:26:59.278 --> 01:27:00.359
[SPEAKER_02]: Our company does too.

01:27:00.459 --> 01:27:03.761
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could work in the video game industry as a massage therapist.

01:27:04.901 --> 01:27:05.721
[SPEAKER_05]: It's possible.

01:27:06.642 --> 01:27:08.723
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to have that be your catch on this show.

01:27:09.083 --> 01:27:12.405
[SPEAKER_02]: She works in the game therapy, giving massages and happy endings.

01:27:12.785 --> 01:27:13.805
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give happy endings.

01:27:14.085 --> 01:27:14.946
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny, though?

01:27:14.966 --> 01:27:24.590
[SPEAKER_05]: We learned that in San Francisco, in the county, for you to be a massage therapist there, it's considered adult entertainment, so you're lumped in the same category as prostitutes.

01:27:25.431 --> 01:27:25.671
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot.

01:27:26.178 --> 01:27:29.159
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I hate it.

01:27:29.279 --> 01:27:32.840
[SPEAKER_05]: The last question, I doubt that PS3 will sell many due to its high prices in the UK.

01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:35.021
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a lot over here.

01:27:35.081 --> 01:27:36.921
[SPEAKER_05]: We get bummed at everything in gaming.

01:27:38.301 --> 01:27:40.862
[SPEAKER_05]: Most young gamers already have a 360 or at least a Wii.

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:45.063
[SPEAKER_05]: Just thinking about how much market it will really have apart from now.

01:27:45.163 --> 01:27:47.004
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, it's Sony's stupid fanboy impression.

01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:52.801
[SPEAKER_05]: I must say the graphics do look good, no better than 360, though, and played one with Ridge Racer.

01:27:53.441 --> 01:27:54.321
[SPEAKER_05]: But you played Ridge Racer.

01:27:54.421 --> 01:27:56.862
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not going to... Play Resistance, honestly.

01:27:56.902 --> 01:28:00.542
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that one really plays up the system's capabilities well.

01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:04.423
[SPEAKER_05]: So, apart from that, though, yeah, the rest of it's crap.

01:28:05.683 --> 01:28:07.163
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I failed to keep it short, but oh well.

01:28:07.223 --> 01:28:08.083
[SPEAKER_05]: This week has been busy.

01:28:08.143 --> 01:28:10.084
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to college next week, so hope that goes well.

01:28:10.104 --> 01:28:11.224
[SPEAKER_05]: Until next time, Neki.

01:28:12.344 --> 01:28:13.044
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for the email.

01:28:13.064 --> 01:28:13.804
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a lot of questions.

01:28:13.924 --> 01:28:16.805
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like... Yeah, and I actually skipped... 20 questions from our UK...

01:28:17.946 --> 01:28:18.647
[SPEAKER_02]: A UK fan.

01:28:18.687 --> 01:28:20.270
[SPEAKER_05]: He got to L, but one repeated.

01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.851
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

01:28:21.131 --> 01:28:21.492
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

01:28:21.732 --> 01:28:22.774
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we have two more emails to go.

01:28:22.915 --> 01:28:23.135
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:28:24.638 --> 01:28:28.485
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is from one of our listeners in Belgium, Fabrice.

01:28:28.525 --> 01:28:28.925
[SPEAKER_05]: Fabrice.

01:28:31.029 --> 01:28:34.131
[SPEAKER_02]: You know one good thing I liked that all games had at their little thing?

01:28:34.311 --> 01:28:38.354
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a big map of the world, and every time they got a caller from somewhere, they'd put a pin in the map.

01:28:38.755 --> 01:28:40.816
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we totally need to steal that idea.

01:28:41.156 --> 01:28:41.657
[SPEAKER_05]: For our email.

01:28:41.777 --> 01:28:43.258
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking about, well, we could do both.

01:28:43.358 --> 01:28:44.259
[SPEAKER_02]: We do emails on callers.

01:28:44.439 --> 01:28:46.521
[SPEAKER_02]: We have blue pins for emails, red pins for callers.

01:28:48.502 --> 01:28:51.304
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only discovered OLR since episode 180 or something since then.

01:28:51.324 --> 01:28:52.144
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been listening every week.

01:28:52.164 --> 01:28:54.706
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I can't listen to your live show because I live in Belgium.

01:29:20.544 --> 01:29:23.125
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder what you at OLR think of the current state of Sega.

01:29:23.426 --> 01:29:26.647
[SPEAKER_05]: The last years, they've done nothing but release crappy game after crappy game.

01:29:27.128 --> 01:29:33.211
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as they use the EA technique, release as much games as you can and you'll earn money easily.

01:29:33.511 --> 01:29:36.853
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic the Hedgehog was somewhat the epitaph for what they are doing.

01:29:36.893 --> 01:29:43.417
[SPEAKER_05]: They only had some good titles, but only the short period after the Dreamcast was dead, like Panzer Dragoon Orta, etc.,

01:29:44.113 --> 01:29:47.996
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a Sega fanboy, but it's even hard for me to get excited about a new Sega title.

01:29:48.577 --> 01:29:52.560
[SPEAKER_05]: All I'm looking forward to is Sega Rally Revo and Virtua Tennis 3.

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:54.322
[SPEAKER_05]: What is wrong with them?

01:29:54.382 --> 01:29:55.723
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they miss their own console?

01:29:55.783 --> 01:29:57.825
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they go with the times?

01:29:57.865 --> 01:29:58.946
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they lacking the talent?

01:29:59.406 --> 01:30:06.453
[SPEAKER_05]: Will the Dreamcast days ever return when they made games like Virtua Tennis, Crazy Taxi, Shenmue, Rez, etc.?

01:30:06.893 --> 01:30:10.216
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all highly playable, enjoyable, and everyone, not only the hardcore gamer...

01:30:11.043 --> 01:30:12.725
[SPEAKER_05]: and for everyone, not only the hardcore gamer.

01:30:13.105 --> 01:30:16.027
[SPEAKER_05]: Sega wasn't afraid to experiment and come up with some crazy ideas.

01:30:16.528 --> 01:30:18.529
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, I wonder what your thoughts on Sega are these days.

01:30:18.589 --> 01:30:20.831
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up the good work and DarkSakura Disneyland rules.

01:30:21.071 --> 01:30:21.532
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you.

01:30:25.335 --> 01:30:25.775
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:30:26.156 --> 01:30:27.176
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a tough question.

01:30:27.637 --> 01:30:32.641
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that Sega was making systems for so long and now they only make games.

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:37.245
[SPEAKER_02]: So there has to be some downsizing that comes with that and some of your biggest talents jump ship.

01:30:37.905 --> 01:30:38.886
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just in a funk.

01:30:39.787 --> 01:30:40.147
[SPEAKER_05]: I think

01:30:40.842 --> 01:30:47.288
[SPEAKER_05]: I think though that when you are making games for your system, you know how to make it work on your system.

01:30:47.348 --> 01:30:57.117
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that is a lot of strength that when it's your product and you have all the in-house stuff available to you, you know how to make the most of it.

01:30:57.918 --> 01:31:03.603
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think that that might be hurting them with some of the newer titles, but also I think that honestly...

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:11.322
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to say it, but Sega's going to need to get back on the track and find out what made them great to begin with.

01:31:11.402 --> 01:31:16.023
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, instead of doing all the flashy, showy stuff, they need to get back to the heart.

01:31:16.283 --> 01:31:18.924
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that they need to take a, you know, page from Nintendo.

01:31:19.564 --> 01:31:22.364
[SPEAKER_02]: Phantasy Star Universe wasn't bad, in my opinion.

01:31:22.905 --> 01:31:23.925
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't great.

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:25.145
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not really average games.

01:31:25.185 --> 01:31:27.906
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Full Auto was awesome, and Chromehounds is...

01:31:28.496 --> 01:31:31.198
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, again, most people didn't like Full Auto or Full Auto 2.

01:31:31.498 --> 01:31:34.061
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of in your own little bubble there.

01:31:34.481 --> 01:31:35.061
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed it.

01:31:35.141 --> 01:31:35.882
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed Full Auto.

01:31:35.902 --> 01:31:37.703
[SPEAKER_02]: I did end up selling it back, but I enjoyed it.

01:31:37.824 --> 01:31:39.105
[SPEAKER_01]: Full Auto 2 is kind of eh.

01:31:39.725 --> 01:31:44.869
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, hell, they've got a ton of cool games coming out pretty soon.

01:31:45.069 --> 01:31:47.411
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonic and the Secret Rings, which should be pretty cool.

01:31:47.451 --> 01:31:50.854
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as long as the control is good on it.

01:31:51.034 --> 01:31:51.835
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtua Fighter 5.

01:31:52.235 --> 01:31:54.917
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's going to be a pretty solid fighting game for the PS3.

01:31:54.957 --> 01:31:56.859
[SPEAKER_01]: Sega Rallye Revo.

01:31:58.655 --> 01:32:03.576
[SPEAKER_01]: Armored Core 4, the game that I've been waiting for for the longest time.

01:32:03.596 --> 01:32:11.838
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought Chromehounds thinking, hey, maybe it's like Armored Core 4, but no, it's like Armored Core 4 with Mono or something like that.

01:32:13.138 --> 01:32:14.159
[SPEAKER_05]: We need Knights on Wii.

01:32:14.899 --> 01:32:16.759
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say some interesting comments from chat.

01:32:16.779 --> 01:32:19.800
[SPEAKER_02]: DDRDollarBill says, Sega needs to make more games that are unique.

01:32:22.061 --> 01:32:26.382
[SPEAKER_02]: Bandit says, first Sega starts making consoles, then drop that and just got into games.

01:32:26.602 --> 01:32:27.602
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony, you're next.

01:32:29.119 --> 01:32:33.182
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt has an idea on how Sega can get back to their roots.

01:32:33.242 --> 01:32:35.243
[SPEAKER_02]: Two words, blast processing.

01:32:48.089 --> 01:32:49.550
[SPEAKER_05]: SEGA TASANSHIRO!

01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:16.810
[SPEAKER_02]: or, you know what, I hate to say it, but since Nintendo doesn't have the oomph behind it, you know, with the Wii, the Wii doesn't have that pretty stuff.

01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:28.197
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there will be inevitably an F-Zero game on the Wii that will be pretty awesome, but seriously, like, if Sega made a racer kind of like that, I'm not talking full auto, on the 360, oh, that would be hot.

01:33:28.577 --> 01:33:29.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it would be hot.

01:33:29.238 --> 01:33:31.960
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, actually, franchise, I wouldn't mind seeing coming out on the next system.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:32.340
[SPEAKER_02]: Or PS3.

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:37.463
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a, I believe it was a Sega, it was Burning Rangers franchise.

01:33:38.888 --> 01:33:41.970
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I know it was because the music was on freaking Samba de Amigo.

01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:45.212
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need Burning Rangers to come back.

01:33:45.973 --> 01:33:49.395
[SPEAKER_02]: To clarify for chat, because they're saying F-Zero was done by Sega, not the original, obviously.

01:33:49.435 --> 01:33:53.398
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I meant the GameCube version in Arcade, GX and AX.

01:33:54.078 --> 01:34:02.844
[SPEAKER_02]: AX was Namco, Sega, Nintendo, the Triforce, and then GX was just Sega and Nintendo.

01:34:02.884 --> 01:34:06.447
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you what, booting that game for the first time and seeing both those logos on the screen at the same time

01:34:07.438 --> 01:34:09.460
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a weird feeling for me, the 80s gamer.

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:09.920
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:12.543
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it make you feel happy in the pants?

01:34:12.703 --> 01:34:14.224
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it made me feel weird.

01:34:15.726 --> 01:34:18.869
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at this going, but Sega does what Nintendo don't.

01:34:19.029 --> 01:34:21.151
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't... This is beyond comprehension.

01:34:22.272 --> 01:34:22.872
[SPEAKER_02]: Another email?

01:34:22.892 --> 01:34:24.093
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually was the last of our emails.

01:34:24.113 --> 01:34:24.374
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it wasn't?

01:34:24.394 --> 01:34:24.994
[SPEAKER_02]: Another window opened.

01:34:25.274 --> 01:34:25.575
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:34:26.275 --> 01:34:27.837
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, send us more.

01:34:27.897 --> 01:34:28.457
[SPEAKER_05]: Send us more.

01:34:28.818 --> 01:34:31.180
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:31.981
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure after...

01:34:32.677 --> 01:34:35.018
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our stories tonight, we'll get plenty of emails.

01:34:35.038 --> 01:34:36.779
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, dude, Battletoads vs. Double Dragon.

01:34:36.859 --> 01:34:38.480
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah, we need a new one of that.

01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:39.100
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Sega do that?

01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:42.842
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on Genesis.

01:34:42.882 --> 01:34:45.343
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't Tecmo responsible for both those franchises?

01:34:45.523 --> 01:34:46.744
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

01:34:46.764 --> 01:34:51.066
[SPEAKER_05]: Streets of Rage was Burning Knuckle.

01:34:51.086 --> 01:34:51.986
[SPEAKER_02]: Battletoads was Rare.

01:34:52.527 --> 01:34:55.008
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Battletoads was Acclaim, I want to say.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:56.660
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll remember.

01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:58.601
[SPEAKER_02]: Making me go to Wikipedia.

01:34:59.722 --> 01:35:03.484
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so anyways, we've got some interesting stuff about Nintendo, actually.

01:35:03.544 --> 01:35:08.327
[SPEAKER_01]: MadCatz is doing a third-party Wiimote that looks like a penis.

01:35:09.027 --> 01:35:11.328
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, way to go, MadCatz.

01:35:11.428 --> 01:35:16.111
[SPEAKER_01]: You've taken the Wii and made it look like a sex toy.

01:35:17.191 --> 01:35:17.652
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.

01:35:18.472 --> 01:35:21.694
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, it's supposed to be more ergonomic looking, but it looks like a penis.

01:35:22.034 --> 01:35:22.414
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

01:35:23.575 --> 01:35:24.055
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um,

01:35:25.106 --> 01:35:28.348
[SPEAKER_01]: Be sure to pick up your third-party penis by Mad Catz.

01:35:28.788 --> 01:35:29.408
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming soon.

01:35:30.769 --> 01:35:31.049
[SPEAKER_02]: Joy.

01:35:31.329 --> 01:35:31.609
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely.

01:35:32.050 --> 01:35:37.592
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember them saying they were going to have the third-party Wiimotes, but it's kind of interesting to see what some of them look like.

01:35:37.672 --> 01:35:38.573
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like a penis.

01:35:38.873 --> 01:35:39.953
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't.

01:35:40.094 --> 01:35:41.614
[SPEAKER_01]: It does so look like a penis.

01:35:41.894 --> 01:35:42.655
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the balls?

01:35:43.355 --> 01:35:44.596
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, just a shaft.

01:35:45.516 --> 01:35:45.996
Let me see.

01:35:47.937 --> 01:35:49.358
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a vibrator.

01:35:49.898 --> 01:35:52.840
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't look like any penis I've ever seen.

01:35:53.662 --> 01:35:54.022
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.

01:35:54.123 --> 01:35:55.564
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a sex toy, though.

01:35:57.205 --> 01:36:08.614
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, and with those freaking homemade programs that you can use your Bluetooth devices for, including the Wii vibrator thing, there you go.

01:36:08.974 --> 01:36:10.916
[SPEAKER_01]: They've made a complete package for you.

01:36:11.737 --> 01:36:13.678
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, thank you, Wikipedia.

01:36:13.758 --> 01:36:16.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Battletoads was a video game franchise by Tradewest.

01:36:17.241 --> 01:36:20.083
[SPEAKER_02]: The first game was released by Rare for the NES in 1991.

01:36:22.435 --> 01:36:22.956
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

01:36:23.196 --> 01:36:26.600
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember, I think TradeWest had something to do with Double Dragon too, if that makes sense.

01:36:29.263 --> 01:36:31.646
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they made the original Double Dragon on the NES.

01:36:31.666 --> 01:36:32.027
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

01:36:32.527 --> 01:36:33.368
[SPEAKER_02]: Or published it, whatever.

01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.450
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:36:35.771 --> 01:36:38.493
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, this is a good time for us to take a break, I think.

01:36:38.513 --> 01:36:40.815
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for a little while here, so we're going to take ourselves a little break.

01:36:41.315 --> 01:36:44.218
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will come back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:36:44.878 --> 01:36:49.862
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

01:36:50.322 --> 01:36:54.626
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
