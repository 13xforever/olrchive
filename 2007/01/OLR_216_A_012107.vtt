WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
New developments with the Guitar Hero series, including Drum Villain, and Can You Fix a

00:24.000 --> 00:33.000
Broken 360 with Towels?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.320
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.320 --> 00:40.720
I say welcome back because we missed a show last week, but we'll get into that in a moment.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.160
First, let's introduce ourselves.

00:42.160 --> 00:45.880
We are that podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know about video

00:45.880 --> 00:48.080
game culture and the video game lifestyle.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.080
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:49.080 --> 00:52.480
Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:52.480 --> 00:53.480
Yo, what up?

00:53.480 --> 00:56.640
How are you doing, Ms. Summers?

00:56.640 --> 00:58.480
I'm alive, sort of.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.480
That's good.

00:59.480 --> 01:00.480
That's good.

01:00.480 --> 01:03.160
I had a very good time last week on our weekend off with you.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.400
We had a great time.

01:04.400 --> 01:08.000
Myself and Dark Sakura and the OLR lesbians all went to Disneyland, and it was a good

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
time.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.680
We had a very interesting time.

01:12.680 --> 01:16.360
And I know some listeners sometimes give Jamie a hard time because she talks about Disneyland

01:16.360 --> 01:18.000
a lot on this show, and I'm one of them.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.420
I have a hard time talking about Disneyland so much on this program, but I kind of get

01:22.420 --> 01:23.420
it now.

01:23.420 --> 01:26.840
We've had a great time, and it really is something else.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.240
Space Mountain four times.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.360
Rocking Space Mountain four times in a row was awesome.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.600
I think it's just really cool.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.160
I remember that we have day jobs.

01:35.160 --> 01:39.880
OLR is not what we do for a living, and it's just kind of nice to have a week off to go

01:39.880 --> 01:40.880
have nothing but fun.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.760
And that's what Disneyland was really all about, was just fun and good friends and good

01:43.760 --> 01:44.760
times.

01:44.760 --> 01:45.760
It was great.

01:45.760 --> 01:46.760
I had a really good time.

01:46.760 --> 01:47.760
Group hug.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.760
All right.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.720
Anyway, also joining us tonight, say hello to Loki.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.720
Hello.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.720
How you doing, Loki?

01:52.720 --> 01:53.720
I'm fine.

01:53.720 --> 01:54.720
What did you do last week?

01:54.720 --> 02:21.120
I also went to that same reception with Loki.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.120
That's right.

02:22.120 --> 02:25.680
And you went to the folks who got married through Final Fantasy XI, right?

02:25.680 --> 02:26.680
Yes.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.040
You don't play Final Fantasy XI anymore, though, right?

02:28.040 --> 02:31.040
I did for the past two weeks.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.040
What made you...

02:32.040 --> 02:33.040
But you quit again.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.040
Yes, I quit again.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.840
So what made you decide to start playing Final Fantasy XI and then quit again?

02:36.840 --> 02:40.980
Because I missed it, and then when I came back, I played it, and then I didn't miss

02:40.980 --> 02:41.980
it anymore.

02:41.980 --> 02:44.020
So it was time to cancel.

02:44.020 --> 02:46.040
What made you decide you did the right thing by quitting?

02:46.040 --> 02:48.360
What do you mean, what made me decide?

02:48.360 --> 02:51.440
Well, because you said you went back for two weeks, and then you quit.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.880
So obviously, you must have come to the conclusion during those two weeks that, oh, I made the

02:54.880 --> 02:55.880
right decision quitting.

02:55.880 --> 02:56.880
Oh, yeah.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.240
Well, because being a blue mage is freaking boring trying to get those spells, and when

03:00.240 --> 03:06.240
you spend two hours hunting this one monster, trying to get one spell off of it, you realize

03:06.240 --> 03:09.640
that your time could be better spent somewhere else.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.680
Like looking for a party.

03:12.680 --> 03:13.680
All right.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.600
Look at the chatroom comments here at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

03:16.600 --> 03:20.640
We always invite the chatters to always be another guest here on the program, and they

03:20.640 --> 03:21.640
have their comments.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.280
We have some really good voicemails this week, by the way.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.560
We're going to get to it later on in Part B. Just another way we encourage you guys

03:26.560 --> 03:28.200
to interact with us.

03:28.200 --> 03:32.620
Shadow Slayer says, just sat around and talked equals strippers.

03:32.620 --> 03:33.620
Is this true?

03:33.620 --> 03:39.160
No, it's just in his mom's coffee shop, so sitting around talking is literally sitting

03:39.160 --> 03:40.160
around talking.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.360
Lattes and strippers, good times.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.360
I wish.

03:44.360 --> 03:49.840
Nellie and I were hoping for strippers with fireworks and jet packs, and we actually almost

03:49.840 --> 03:53.480
got somebody to believe that that was going to happen, but they were an idiot, so it doesn't

03:53.480 --> 03:54.480
matter.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.560
That would be Kat, and she was an idiot.

03:56.560 --> 03:57.840
Wait, like literally.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.240
Does Kat listen to this program?

03:59.240 --> 04:00.240
Can she defend herself?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.720
I don't think she knows how to operate a computer, okay?

04:02.720 --> 04:03.720
All right.

04:03.720 --> 04:04.720
She's a complete idiot.

04:04.720 --> 04:05.720
All right.

04:05.720 --> 04:10.160
Well, welcome back, of course, to all of our live listeners and our podcast listeners since

04:10.160 --> 04:11.720
there was no program last week.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.960
Again, we apologize for not being here, but now that the holidays are over and we're all

04:15.960 --> 04:19.400
back into our daily routine, unfortunately, we're kind of in a situation where Jamie's

04:19.400 --> 04:24.060
doing school in the early evenings, and Loki has to go to bed early for his job, which

04:24.060 --> 04:27.680
takes out the late evenings, so it's very hard for us to pre-record when we're not here

04:27.680 --> 04:30.640
on Sundays, so sorry about that, but that's what happened.

04:30.640 --> 04:34.580
If you were here listening live, though, Travis Donovan from our Saturday Night program on

04:34.580 --> 04:40.320
Orange Launch Radio did a real fantastic little tribute program, and if you listen to one

04:40.320 --> 04:45.520
of our buddy podcasts, All Games Interactive, Dark Soccer and I appeared on the Friday edition,

04:45.520 --> 04:50.760
and it was something else.

04:50.760 --> 04:51.760
It was a good time, though.

04:51.760 --> 04:52.760
It was slightly embarrassing.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.760
Yeah.

04:53.760 --> 04:54.760
It was a good time.

04:54.760 --> 04:55.760
I had fun.

04:55.760 --> 04:56.760
That's what it's all about.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.240
I need to find the podcast for that since I wasn't there.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.320
I didn't really.

04:59.320 --> 05:00.320
You were missed, though.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.280
They kept saying it was two-thirds of Orange Launch Radio.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.280
Where's Loki?

05:03.280 --> 05:04.280
Why isn't he here?

05:04.280 --> 05:05.280
Why doesn't he like us?

05:05.280 --> 05:08.320
We had to kind of explain that, so it was good, though.

05:08.320 --> 05:14.520
I didn't realize that their Free Play Fridays were so free, but it was a good time.

05:14.520 --> 05:15.520
I had a really good time.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.280
Thanks to Scott for having us on.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.280
It's good.

05:18.280 --> 05:23.640
I like doing radio with Scott because he plays such different types of games than we do that

05:23.640 --> 05:25.520
it's fun to kind of debate a little bit.

05:25.520 --> 05:30.080
We got into that a little bit on the Free Play Friday show before things all went to

05:30.080 --> 05:32.600
hell in a good way.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.600
We had a really good time.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.600
We hope to go back sometime.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.780
We've gotten some real positive feedback from that.

05:36.780 --> 05:40.120
I know there was something in the mailbag that maybe Dark Soccer is going to read for

05:40.120 --> 05:41.120
us later.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.120
I think we had a voicemail, too.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.880
I don't think we were going to play the voicemail, but somebody had left us a voicemail and said

05:44.880 --> 05:47.880
it was really great.

05:47.880 --> 05:52.640
We love doing radio with those guys and kind of coming together in that Voltron-esque sense

05:52.640 --> 05:53.960
to do radio together.

05:53.960 --> 05:54.960
It was cool.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.240
Miklotov says, how about Power Rangers instead?

05:57.240 --> 05:59.840
I'm going to say Power Rangers ripped off Voltron.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.440
Does anybody watch Power Rangers anymore except you?

06:03.440 --> 06:06.400
There's another guy at my work that does, and we're going to have an Operation Overdrive

06:06.400 --> 06:09.240
party when the new season premieres.

06:09.240 --> 06:12.120
Let's talk a little bit about how is your gaming week, because that's how we always

06:12.120 --> 06:13.120
like to start off the show.

06:13.120 --> 06:16.120
We've got a couple of weeks to cover here, so we'll start off with Dark Soccer.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.120
How was your gaming week?

06:17.120 --> 06:24.080
I played Cook and Mama and Astro Blasters at Disneyland.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.080
It counts as a game, right?

06:25.080 --> 06:28.000
Astro Blasters is one of the best video games I've ever played in my life.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.360
That was some good times.

06:29.360 --> 06:33.440
We might be getting another pinball machine that you would be interested in.

06:33.440 --> 06:34.440
What's that?

06:34.440 --> 06:35.440
Bride of Pinbot.

06:35.440 --> 06:36.440
Sweet.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.440
Very cool.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.440
I told Dan to try to get it for me.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.120
Not a lot of console stuff otherwise?

06:40.120 --> 06:41.120
Not really.

06:41.120 --> 06:45.760
I almost got rid of PSU and then went, nah.

06:45.760 --> 06:53.760
I turned on Guild Wars and then said, nah.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.880
It just went through the whole booting and patching and that whole process.

06:56.880 --> 06:57.880
You were like, nah.

06:57.880 --> 06:58.880
Yeah, pretty much.

06:58.880 --> 06:59.880
That was it.

06:59.880 --> 07:00.880
All right.

07:00.880 --> 07:01.880
Good times.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.320
Loki, how was your gaming week?

07:03.320 --> 07:04.320
My gaming week was good.

07:04.320 --> 07:11.760
I had a gaming party last night actually and Rob was there and he can attest to the fact.

07:11.760 --> 07:19.160
WarioWare Smooth Moves is fun but playing it with 11 people at the same time is crazy

07:19.160 --> 07:24.160
and it adds a whole new element of fun into it that I don't even know how to describe.

07:24.160 --> 07:31.600
I have never had a video gaming experience quite like 11 player WarioWare.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.120
I don't know how to describe it.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.120
It was insane.

07:34.120 --> 07:39.040
Just so you guys know, in WarioWare, you only get to use one baton.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.200
They call it the baton in the game but it's Wiimote.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.080
You only get to use one Wiimote in multiplayer.

07:44.080 --> 07:51.520
So part of the fun of it was actually passing off the baton in time to other people.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.280
It was actually kind of funny.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.480
The whole thing is ridiculous.

07:54.480 --> 08:01.160
They have your Miis flying around like this angel form and it really looks weird.

08:01.160 --> 08:07.560
So you have all these weird Mi faces with this angel body thing that doesn't even fit

08:07.560 --> 08:11.520
and then you have these games that you're playing and it keeps getting faster and everyone

08:11.520 --> 08:12.520
was just cracking up.

08:12.520 --> 08:13.840
It was just a lot of fun.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.760
Did you notice how OLR totally dominated the multiplayer games?

08:16.760 --> 08:20.960
Because you won one, Megalotov won one, Extra for won one and I won one.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.960
We played it four times.

08:21.960 --> 08:22.960
Well, we played games more than that.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.960
No, I know.

08:23.960 --> 08:24.960
That's true.

08:24.960 --> 08:25.960
So we did that.

08:25.960 --> 08:26.960
That was really fun.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.940
But that's just because at this gamer party, you had some casual gamers there.

08:30.940 --> 08:35.000
What were the level of people like Tiffany and Heather and the other Rob?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.740
Did they play a lot of games?

08:36.740 --> 08:38.440
My sister plays quite a bit.

08:38.440 --> 08:43.160
She's finished Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 and she's played through Zelda and all this stuff.

08:43.160 --> 08:44.160
So she plays quite a bit.

08:44.160 --> 08:46.040
She has my GameCube right now.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.040
Because they were all into it.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.840
The only person that didn't seem so into it was Nellie.

08:48.840 --> 08:49.840
She was kind of like, I hate this.

08:49.840 --> 08:50.840
Nellie doesn't play too many games.

08:50.840 --> 08:51.840
But she laughed.

08:51.840 --> 08:52.840
I mean, she just laughed.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.240
And then Tiffany really doesn't play that many games.

08:55.240 --> 08:58.780
I think she may play a little bit of the Xbox, but she wants to get a Wii.

08:58.780 --> 09:00.560
She doesn't have one yet.

09:00.560 --> 09:01.560
So that's funny.

09:01.560 --> 09:05.160
And then Mel, of course, plays some stuff.

09:05.160 --> 09:10.360
And everyone plays a pretty average amount of games and stuff.

09:10.360 --> 09:15.300
So I think a lot of people really liked it and definitely people that were going to get

09:15.300 --> 09:19.640
a Wii are probably going to get this game as well because it's just crazy.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.640
The dance mini game was hilarious.

09:21.640 --> 09:25.640
Yeah, Shane shared this idea with us that you can do the dance.

09:25.640 --> 09:29.560
You go into the mode where you just play a mini game over and over again and you do the

09:29.560 --> 09:32.120
dance mini game, but you set it on the fastest setting.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.120
It's pretty funny.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.120
It's fun to watch.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.760
Yeah, it's crazy.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.160
And then we played Resistance Fall Man.

09:39.160 --> 09:42.880
We've been playing that all week during lunches and we played that last night too for a while.

09:42.880 --> 09:46.440
And I had a really interesting glitch after you left.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.020
We were playing multiplayer.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.280
First we started off with just doing four player multiplayer and stuff.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.780
And that's a fun game, multiplayer.

09:53.780 --> 09:57.420
Then we decided rockets only, infinite ammo.

09:57.420 --> 09:58.920
And we picked really tiny maps.

09:58.920 --> 10:06.800
And that was pretty fun, except one time I spawned and I just kept flying up into the

10:06.800 --> 10:07.800
air.

10:07.800 --> 10:08.800
So it was really weird.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.680
That was kind of funny.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.000
You guys were playing Red Steel at one point too.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
That's about it.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.280
I was going to get to Red Steel.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.280
Did it play as god awful as it looked?

10:18.280 --> 10:23.340
Because I haven't really played a lot of Red Steel, but that game did not look fun when

10:23.340 --> 10:26.040
you guys were playing a multiplayer.

10:26.040 --> 10:31.240
It was not like when everybody was playing WarioWare where everyone knew what to do.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.880
The thing shows you how to hold the controller and you kind of take it from there.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.640
But Red Steel was like, how do I hang up the phone?

10:35.640 --> 10:36.800
What the hell am I doing?

10:36.800 --> 10:39.960
I had never played Red Steel four player.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.640
I've only done it two or three.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.960
So I figured, okay, let's give it another try on a bigger TV so you can actually see

10:45.960 --> 10:47.840
what's going on and stuff.

10:47.840 --> 10:53.200
And so four player, I thought it'd be cool if we tried the mode where the Wiimote rings

10:53.200 --> 10:58.320
like a phone and you pick it up and you get a mission from the person on the line.

10:58.320 --> 11:04.140
Well, it's a cool concept, but it's completely annoying and stupid at the same time.

11:04.140 --> 11:05.840
So Red Steel really sucks.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.280
You can't control it for shit.

11:07.280 --> 11:12.240
The little phone mode, I mean, the thing is ringing all the goddamn time and stupid shit

11:12.240 --> 11:16.920
like kill the cook and it'll use an Uzi or something like that.

11:16.920 --> 11:21.400
And if you don't pick up the phone, it'll just keep ringing for you and it's just really

11:21.400 --> 11:22.400
annoying.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.040
You know, this is the last draw for this game.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.440
I'm definitely selling it back now.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.520
I mean, it was a complete waste of money in the first place.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.920
It's just an utter disappointment.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.420
I wanted to give it a second chance and so I did and it's awful.

11:34.420 --> 11:36.960
That's the first time you asked me like, do you want to play this?

11:36.960 --> 11:39.440
And I was like, no, I don't.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.440
Yeah.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.880
So that really sucked.

11:41.880 --> 11:46.560
And then I'm trying to think what else we played there.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.200
Rob D. in chat agrees with you.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.200
Loki's right.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.200
Phone mode sucks.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.200
It always rings.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.200
You can't hear it.

11:52.200 --> 11:56.840
I mean, it sounded like a cool concept in the beginning, you know, when they were talking

11:56.840 --> 12:00.640
about it, but it's just horribly, horribly executed.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.720
So, you know, I can't recommend that game at all.

12:03.720 --> 12:08.360
And then finally, you know, we're playing more Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, which

12:08.360 --> 12:10.640
I hear is now coming out on PlayStation 2.

12:10.640 --> 12:14.280
My boss will be extremely happy about that.

12:14.280 --> 12:17.320
And just, you know, the usual stuff.

12:17.320 --> 12:21.000
But yeah, right now Wario War is going to have to hold me over until SSX comes out.

12:21.000 --> 12:27.680
It kind of sucks with only one game coming out in the month, but that's about it.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.680
All right.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.680
Can I make an interjection?

12:30.680 --> 12:31.680
Sure.

12:31.680 --> 12:32.680
Why not?

12:32.680 --> 12:33.680
There's one other game.

12:33.680 --> 12:34.680
Okay.

12:34.680 --> 12:35.680
What's that?

12:35.680 --> 12:36.680
R-Type 3.

12:36.680 --> 12:37.680
Oh, on the virtual console?

12:37.680 --> 12:38.680
Oh, yeah.

12:38.680 --> 12:39.680
How was that?

12:39.680 --> 12:41.280
Well, I actually never had R-Type 3 before, so it was actually really fun.

12:41.280 --> 12:46.440
And I love the mode 7-tastic stuff that happens in it, because as you're going through it,

12:46.440 --> 12:48.920
it's like it fully has a real 3D feel to it.

12:48.920 --> 12:53.920
And my favorite thing is, like, right at the beginning, when these, I guess, sort of mini-boss

12:53.920 --> 12:57.760
type things pop up, you can kill them in one, you know, charge shot.

12:57.760 --> 13:01.440
And then another one comes up behind you, and then he swings around you, and then you

13:01.440 --> 13:02.580
bitch can't kill him.

13:02.580 --> 13:06.280
And then he suddenly looks behind him and runs into a wall and blows up.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.160
You know, how is it as a shooter game?

13:08.160 --> 13:09.280
I was contemplating getting it.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.280
I don't know much about R-Type.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.280
It's R-Type!

13:11.280 --> 13:13.480
I can get it!

13:13.480 --> 13:17.400
I never really owned a Turbo Grafx-16 or a Sega back in the day.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.400
Did you get the first R-Type?

13:18.400 --> 13:19.400
I did.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.120
And it kind of reminded me of Gradius, really.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.120
It was just like Gradius.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.120
It's hard.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.120
It is.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.120
It was a little harder than Gradius.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.120
R-Type is hard.

13:26.120 --> 13:29.760
R-Type 3 is, sort of to me, like a faster paced R-Type.

13:29.760 --> 13:30.760
For eight bucks?

13:30.760 --> 13:32.640
Should I spend eight bucks on it?

13:32.640 --> 13:33.640
Yeah!

13:33.640 --> 13:34.640
Sure!

13:34.640 --> 13:35.640
R-Type!

13:35.640 --> 13:40.260
It's actually one of the only R-Type games, actually I think, yeah, that was specifically

13:40.260 --> 13:41.260
for Super Nintendo.

13:41.260 --> 13:42.260
Check it out.

13:42.260 --> 13:43.260
Check it out.

13:43.260 --> 13:44.260
It's worth it.

13:44.260 --> 13:45.260
Maybe you should come over to your house and play it first.

13:45.260 --> 13:46.260
No, you're going to download it.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.260
Alright, fine.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.680
Let's see how you are.

13:48.680 --> 13:50.520
Miklotov, how was your gaming week?

13:50.520 --> 13:52.520
What have you been playing?

13:52.520 --> 13:56.920
Well, I'm still playing the crap out of Elite Beat Agents because I can't get enough of

13:56.920 --> 14:05.680
it and I'm almost down to zero everything except for Elite Beats on Jumping Jack Flash

14:05.680 --> 14:10.360
on Elite Beat Viva's difficulty.

14:10.360 --> 14:14.640
And let's see, I just picked up Final Fantasy III for the DS because it's in stock again,

14:14.640 --> 14:21.240
which is nice, and I played Final Fantasy for two weeks and now I'm playing Burning

14:21.240 --> 14:22.240
Crusade.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.240
Oops.

14:23.240 --> 14:26.240
How's Burning Crusade?

14:26.240 --> 14:30.360
My blood elf is really pretty and he jumps around and twirls, it's great.

14:30.360 --> 14:34.400
What made you decide to go on to Burning Crusade?

14:34.400 --> 14:41.840
Everybody else is doing it and I like to follow people, so I'm easily swayed.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.840
And it's fun.

14:42.840 --> 14:43.840
I like it.

14:43.840 --> 14:44.840
It's cool.

14:44.840 --> 14:45.840
Alright, good times.

14:45.840 --> 14:46.840
You want to tell people your server and characters?

14:46.840 --> 14:47.840
They can come play with you?

14:47.840 --> 14:48.840
Or would you rather stay anonymous?

14:48.840 --> 14:49.840
I don't care.

14:49.840 --> 14:59.000
My server is Ravencrest and my character's name is Arx and I'm a 13 blood elf priest.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.020
Is there any reason why you chose Ravencrest?

15:01.020 --> 15:04.560
Because it reminded me of Ravenclaw because that sounds like something Harry Potter-ish.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.560
Alright.

15:05.560 --> 15:10.600
I was going to say, as you mentioned, that Final Fantasy III is back in stock now.

15:10.600 --> 15:16.200
They've been actually sold out of a lot of stuff, especially the DS Lite.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.960
Nintendo is actually completely sold out now.

15:17.960 --> 15:21.840
They should be coming to the stores in the next week or so, finally catching up.

15:21.840 --> 15:22.840
Same with the Wii.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.840
The Wii's been sold out for a while too.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.720
Nintendo's kind of slow right now.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.200
Sony's kind of showing them up with the amount of units they're getting out there, but no

15:30.200 --> 15:31.680
one's buying them.

15:31.680 --> 15:36.240
Well, my gaming week, a lot of the same stuff most people have actually already beaten me

15:36.240 --> 15:37.240
to and mentioned.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.560
You know, there was Buzz Lightyear ride at Disneyland, which was a lot of fun.

15:40.560 --> 15:43.020
You know what's weird is that the first time we went through it, we rode that ride three

15:43.020 --> 15:44.920
times and the first time was our best score.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.600
We should post that picture on Orange Lounge somewhere.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.200
It's kind of funny.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.440
You got the 38th best score for the day or something, the high score.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.440
I think so.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.440
You kicked my butt at it.

15:53.440 --> 15:57.240
Out of how many thousands of people that went on it?

15:57.240 --> 16:03.560
Well, the whole reason we got so high of a score was because it broke down while we were

16:03.560 --> 16:04.560
on it.

16:04.560 --> 16:09.600
Yeah, because the other times we never stopped in the middle of the ride.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.800
I've done really well on that ride.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.080
I can at least get to a rank four on a regular run-through.

16:14.080 --> 16:18.000
But then I was chatting from the hotel room with Bobby over at All Games and he's like,

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
well, I got a million.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Did you get a million?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I'm like...

16:21.000 --> 16:22.720
Yeah, but his ride stopped too.

16:22.720 --> 16:27.760
All right, so I played that.

16:27.760 --> 16:31.360
I've gone back to World of Warcraft thanks to Burning Crusade, which is funny though

16:31.360 --> 16:33.720
because I didn't buy Burning Crusade.

16:33.720 --> 16:40.920
There's not a lot in Burning Crusade for me because I'm not all like, ooh, ah, over Blood

16:40.920 --> 16:44.200
Elves and Draenei because everybody is playing those.

16:44.200 --> 16:48.240
And especially if you look at the server that Shane and I are playing on, because we always

16:48.240 --> 16:50.640
start on a freaking new server, Ravencrest.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.860
I'm playing a Tauren on Ravencrest.

16:52.860 --> 16:54.600
I'm not running into anybody.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.880
It's like a new server.

16:55.880 --> 16:59.720
All I see are Blood Elves and they're all paladins and they make me want to punch them

16:59.720 --> 17:03.720
because it's annoying because they're all just kind of ganging up on my kills I'm trying

17:03.720 --> 17:04.720
to get.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.100
Yeah, so it's interesting.

17:08.100 --> 17:10.520
And I thought, well, there's not a lot in Burning Crusade for me.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.520
I mean, sure, there's new areas.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.920
You can level to 70 in the jewelcrafting.

17:13.920 --> 17:18.240
But I'm like, okay, I don't want to make that investment unless I actually stick with World

17:18.240 --> 17:19.240
of Warcraft.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.000
Because if you've been listening to this show for a couple of years, you know that I'm notorious.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.820
I'll play World of Warcraft for three months, quit, then start over again in a couple months

17:25.820 --> 17:26.820
on a new server.

17:26.820 --> 17:31.480
But actually, I said, okay, Rob, if you can get a character to level 40, I will reward

17:31.480 --> 17:32.800
you by buying Burning Crusade.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.440
There you go.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.640
And I'm already at what, 11 or 12?

17:36.640 --> 17:40.880
Well, yeah, but the first 10 levels you can do in like an hour.

17:40.880 --> 17:41.880
Whatever.

17:41.880 --> 17:48.240
Anyway, but what's funny is that since Shane had the discs, I installed it on the computer

17:48.240 --> 17:50.360
and so I still have like the pretty intro screen.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.160
But it's kind of neat to have Burning Crusade installed but you don't have access.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.720
So if you're kind of wondering, like if you're out there wondering what happens if I like

17:55.720 --> 18:00.000
Borrow a Friend's discs but I don't have the code, you still get some things changed

18:00.000 --> 18:03.040
like the intro screen and some of the loading screens.

18:03.040 --> 18:06.360
And certainly, you know, you can see everybody but I don't think the game will let you do

18:06.360 --> 18:07.760
anything special outside of that.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.480
That's probably all I'm really getting from that.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.200
So I am going to have to buy a code at some point.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.880
When I get to level 40, that's my reward for myself.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.200
I've also been playing WarioWare Smooth Moves.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.200
Love it.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.720
It's an awesome game.

18:18.720 --> 18:23.560
But I think it kind of suffers from the WarioWare series syndrome where that I don't see much

18:23.560 --> 18:29.360
– let me rephrase that – I don't see much single player replay ability after about

18:29.360 --> 18:33.480
five hours with the game because once you've unlocked all the mini games, not a lot else

18:33.480 --> 18:34.480
to do.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.200
And that's kind of the same way all the WarioWares have been in the past.

18:37.200 --> 18:42.680
But multiplayer is really cool and I think really breathes more life into the game that

18:42.680 --> 18:45.120
the other WarioWares didn't have so much.

18:45.120 --> 18:50.480
I mean, I know the GameCube one had multiplayer that was kind of fun but this one especially

18:50.480 --> 18:52.880
because, you know, the more pick up and go element of it.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.680
So I think if you have people that you can play this with – like if you're the type

18:55.680 --> 19:00.360
of person that would own Mario Party, you definitely should own WarioWare.

19:00.360 --> 19:04.680
But if you're just one person, I actually think this is a title that's a really good

19:04.680 --> 19:05.680
rental.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.840
Like it's probably the best rental title right now possibly out there because I do

19:08.840 --> 19:12.080
think it's the type of game you're going to breeze through pretty quickly.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.080
It's fun.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.080
It's easy to pick up.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.720
It's got a great sense of humor.

19:15.720 --> 19:20.020
A lot of the characters from the old WarioWare games are back but, again, I just don't

19:20.020 --> 19:23.520
see where there's going to be a lot to this game after you've played it for three hours

19:23.520 --> 19:27.520
unless you are a perfectionist and you must master every game.

19:27.520 --> 19:30.080
But if you're a Nintendo fanboy, you probably already own it so what are you listening to

19:30.080 --> 19:31.080
me for?

19:31.080 --> 19:32.980
Well, would you agree with that, Logie?

19:32.980 --> 19:36.520
You know, this whole thing kind of reminds me of, you know, there could be more life

19:36.520 --> 19:41.760
in this game if they had, I don't know, leaderboards or something like that supported

19:41.760 --> 19:46.900
on the Nintendo Wii but since they don't and Nintendo's a fucking retard for not

19:46.900 --> 19:51.920
doing that, you know, there's not as much life as there could be, you know?

19:51.920 --> 19:52.920
I don't know.

19:52.920 --> 19:57.040
Simple fixes like a leaderboard system or something for each individual game would be

19:57.040 --> 19:58.040
pretty cool.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.040
All right.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.880
Well, I think that's about, do I have anything else for my gaming week?

20:02.880 --> 20:03.880
Not really.

20:03.880 --> 20:04.880
I've just pretty much been playing those.

20:04.880 --> 20:08.760
Not a whole lot of, oh, no, there is one new game I wanted to mention also.

20:08.760 --> 20:12.920
I bought Heavy Weapon on Xbox Live Arcade which is a PopCap game, you know, the folks

20:12.920 --> 20:16.080
that made Bejeweled and Zuma but Heavy Weapon is a very different type of game.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.080
It's not a puzzle game.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.080
It's more of an action game.

20:18.080 --> 20:22.080
It reminds me of an old 16-bit shooter and a lot of people have been giving Heavy Weapon

20:22.080 --> 20:26.580
a lot of crap because, you know, they go, oh, another PopCap game.

20:26.580 --> 20:28.160
It's coming out after Ms. Pac-Man.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.280
God, the live arcade line-up sucks, you know.

20:31.280 --> 20:35.440
I could play this on, you know, for free on Flash and da-da-da-da-da.

20:35.440 --> 20:39.500
I think a lot of people are passing judgment on this game before playing it and I would

20:39.500 --> 20:42.560
bet some of your favorite bloggers are doing this too after reading one or reading some

20:42.560 --> 20:46.840
bloggers because people were posting those types of opinions before the game even came

20:46.840 --> 20:47.840
out.

20:47.840 --> 20:51.200
So they were basing their opinions, I know this, off the Flash version of the game.

20:51.200 --> 20:55.040
I do think you should download the demo and check it out, especially if you like those

20:55.040 --> 20:59.540
old 16-bit type of shooters because it actually is a lot of fun and I played multiplayer with

20:59.540 --> 21:02.720
some strangers to, you know, try and get some more achievements and just kind of have fun,

21:02.720 --> 21:03.720
see what it was all about.

21:03.720 --> 21:08.240
I actually thought it was pretty fun and I know you can't do the multiplayer through

21:08.240 --> 21:12.100
the free Flash game and there's a lot of different types of stages.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.960
I actually think it's kind of an underrated purchase right now.

21:14.960 --> 21:21.520
I think I enjoyed this much more than I enjoyed Small Arms or Novidrome or some of those other

21:21.520 --> 21:24.880
originals they were really hyping up or RoboBlitz even.

21:24.880 --> 21:28.500
I didn't really enjoy any of those games as much as I enjoyed Heavy Weapon.

21:28.500 --> 21:33.000
So I really think don't listen to people who pass judgment on this game just because

21:33.000 --> 21:35.520
it's PopCap and they have it, you know, on the website.

21:35.520 --> 21:39.240
You know, if the website is good enough for you and you play the net with them, fine,

21:39.240 --> 21:41.460
you know, then you don't need to spend the $10.

21:41.460 --> 21:44.600
But if you enjoy those types of games, I think you'd really benefit from multiplayer and

21:44.600 --> 21:46.000
some of the other modes this game has.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.740
I had a lot of fun with it and I kind of want to play it again when, you know, my TV is

21:50.740 --> 21:53.880
free of Elibits because Xtaphir has been playing Elibits non-stop.

21:53.880 --> 21:54.880
He beat it.

21:54.880 --> 21:55.880
I saw the final boss in the game.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.720
It was like this Voltron Elibit type thing.

21:57.720 --> 21:58.720
It's crazy.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.560
It was like I didn't know Elibits was so long.

22:00.560 --> 22:06.080
I guess it has like 25, 26 stages and the stages in that game go on for like 10-20 minutes

22:06.080 --> 22:07.080
at a time.

22:07.080 --> 22:10.840
So there's quite a bit of replayability in Elibits, I was surprised.

22:10.840 --> 22:15.000
I do recommend Heavy Weapon for those fans of shooters, at least even if you just have

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
access to Xbox Live.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Check out the demo.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.720
You might like it.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.640
Well that's pretty much all I got for How Was My Gaming Week.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.040
So that's all of us.

22:23.040 --> 22:26.480
So now we're going to go on to housekeeping, which we don't really have a lot of this week.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.400
There's not a lot of new news going on with the station.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.560
You know, we still have our site trucking along and hope to bring you a new website

22:31.560 --> 22:35.640
pretty soon, although it's a lot of work we're finding.

22:35.640 --> 22:40.420
Also just a reminder, we do have programming here on orangeontrader.com almost every week

22:40.420 --> 22:42.240
night throughout the week.

22:42.240 --> 22:45.640
First Tuesday of every month, Dark Soccer is live with Pump Up The Volume, so she's

22:45.640 --> 22:47.640
due for a new show pretty soon.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.160
Wednesday nights, guys on the show, myself and Exeterfer.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.260
Thursday nights, STFU with DMN and DJ Tyrant.

22:53.260 --> 22:56.120
Friday night, Club OLR mixed by Loki.

22:56.120 --> 23:00.200
And Saturday nights, Travis Donovan live, which is always pretty hilarious and he does

23:00.200 --> 23:02.160
a lot of the chat room interaction stuff too.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.440
So check those shows out.

23:04.440 --> 23:08.200
And getting on into the news this week, this was something we actually talked about on

23:08.200 --> 23:09.760
one of the spinoff shows.

23:09.760 --> 23:15.120
And I'm sure you've heard this story talked about to death in the various gaming blogs

23:15.120 --> 23:18.080
out there and on the various websites out there.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.600
We don't want to spend a whole lot of time on it tonight.

23:20.600 --> 23:27.320
But I do find it very ironic that the week we decide to take off a show, huge news happens

23:27.320 --> 23:28.680
literally in our backyard.

23:28.680 --> 23:29.920
I mean literally.

23:29.920 --> 23:34.380
And of course we're referring to the Hold Your Wee for a Wee contest that one of our

23:34.380 --> 23:37.680
local stations here, 107.9 held.

23:37.680 --> 23:41.040
Our morning rave show or whatever held this Hold Your Wee for a Wee contest.

23:41.040 --> 23:45.280
And unfortunately it ended, or I should say resulted, because it was about a couple hours

23:45.280 --> 23:50.240
after the contest ended, resulted in the death of Jennifer Strange, a 28-year-old who was

23:50.240 --> 23:52.560
trying to win a wee for her family.

23:52.560 --> 23:58.680
And what's very interesting, Jennifer Strange lives, or lived, not even about two miles

23:58.680 --> 24:00.520
from where we record Orange Lawn's radio.

24:00.520 --> 24:05.000
So it's kind of, it was kind of weird, kind of hit home that whole story.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.040
At first, I don't know about you guys when you heard about this, but at first I was kind

24:09.040 --> 24:14.920
of thinking this isn't, because I was reading about it on Kotaku, Destructoid, and all those

24:14.920 --> 24:15.920
gaming blogs.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.260
I was thinking this really isn't about gaming.

24:18.260 --> 24:22.080
I mean I understand why these sites covered it, so I'm not trying to fault that or anything,

24:22.080 --> 24:25.480
but I'm kind of thinking to myself, we're really digging a hole for this.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.120
I mean it's not really about the gaming.

24:27.120 --> 24:33.600
I mean surely it's a tragic story, but that goes more to the whole where was the responsibility,

24:33.600 --> 24:37.800
the DJs, the station, the woman that competed in the contest, you know, all that types of

24:37.800 --> 24:38.940
back and forth.

24:38.940 --> 24:43.360
But then, earlier this week, I caught something very interesting on the nightly news, because

24:43.360 --> 24:47.260
as you can imagine here in this area, in the Sacramento area, this story has really dominated

24:47.260 --> 24:52.520
the nightly news, just as when three years ago, someone passed away of the same thing

24:52.520 --> 24:53.680
in a frat hazing in Chico.

24:53.680 --> 24:57.620
I mean that dominated our local news for the longest time, a water intoxication took the

24:57.620 --> 24:58.620
life of theirs.

24:58.620 --> 25:02.960
Somebody was telling me at work the other day, in the past, I think in the past five

25:02.960 --> 25:06.080
years in the Sacramento region, three people have died of water intoxication, which is

25:06.080 --> 25:07.080
abnormal.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.080
That's not normal.

25:08.080 --> 25:11.120
So it's weird that, you know, move to Sacramento, don't drink water.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.280
It's sort of like drowning yourself.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.280
Well, it is.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.000
Essentially, it's kind of what you're doing.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.960
But anyway, so I'm thinking, okay, it's not really gaming related.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.520
I don't know if we should talk about it on Sunday's show, because it's kind of been talked

25:21.520 --> 25:22.520
about to death.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.840
But then this late breaking thing happened.

25:23.840 --> 25:28.120
I caught the news on Thursday, okay, and I posted about this to OrangeLawnTrader.com.

25:28.120 --> 25:31.560
We were watching local news and they were talking about this whole thing.

25:31.560 --> 25:36.240
The reporter, I guess, had talked to the lawyer, and the reporter said that they were considering

25:36.240 --> 25:38.800
expanding the lawsuit that was filed against the station.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.400
I mean, obviously, a civil lawsuit was filed in her death.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.280
I mean, I think we all saw that coming.

25:43.280 --> 25:48.880
The lawsuit is being considered to expand Nintendo and promoters for Justin Timberlake,

25:48.880 --> 25:51.640
because Justin Timberlake's tickets were involved in this concert, too.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.040
They were in the contest, too.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.520
They were a consolation prize.

25:54.520 --> 25:58.240
And now, it's kind of, well, now we're kind of roping it back into gaming, because Nintendo

25:58.240 --> 26:00.120
could get sued over this whole thing.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.640
It's stupid.

26:02.640 --> 26:03.640
It's really stupid.

26:03.640 --> 26:04.640
They had nothing to do with it.

26:04.640 --> 26:05.640
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, too.

26:05.640 --> 26:10.440
I mean, unless they can prove that Nintendo somehow sponsored this contest, which I doubt,

26:10.440 --> 26:14.800
I highly, highly, highly doubt they would sponsor a contest called Hold Your Wee for

26:14.800 --> 26:15.800
a Wee.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.480
They would have never done that, okay?

26:17.480 --> 26:23.320
So unless they can somehow prove that Nintendo sponsored this contest, I don't see that really

26:23.320 --> 26:26.480
happening, that they're going to be able to sue them, but maybe that's what they're exploring

26:26.480 --> 26:27.480
right now.

26:27.480 --> 26:28.480
I don't know.

26:28.480 --> 26:31.840
I don't know if Nintendo's a large company, and he thinks that he can get money from them,

26:31.840 --> 26:34.840
so it makes perfect sense that they would want to do that.

26:34.840 --> 26:35.840
Same with Justin Timberlake.

26:35.840 --> 26:41.120
You know, the guy's got money, so let's try to get a piece of it, a piece of the money.

26:41.120 --> 26:46.080
Because the station, I mean, granted, the station's probably part of a big network,

26:46.080 --> 26:47.400
maybe not so much money there.

26:47.400 --> 26:48.400
I don't know.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.440
And although I can understand where her family's coming from, I mean, it was very tragic what

26:51.440 --> 26:57.240
happened to her, although I do believe she is partially to blame, I felt she was more

26:57.240 --> 26:59.840
to blame until I heard the audio of the whole thing.

26:59.840 --> 27:04.480
When I heard how crass the DJs were and talking about, you know, well, they signed waivers,

27:04.480 --> 27:06.600
what's the worst thing about it, and the fact that people had called them.

27:06.600 --> 27:10.520
I had a co-worker who listened to it, and she was telling me at work about how the one

27:10.520 --> 27:12.800
doctor we all heard about was not the only one to call in.

27:12.800 --> 27:17.420
She said at least two doctors called in telling them not to do it, and they still continued

27:17.420 --> 27:18.420
to do it anyway.

27:18.420 --> 27:23.120
So while, yeah, I kind of fault her for participating, I think there's blame.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.120
It's just tragic.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.280
The whole thing's tragic.

27:25.280 --> 27:32.560
I think, first of all, she deserves a Darwin Award, and too bad she's already bred.

27:32.560 --> 27:38.600
Any person with a brain in their head would know that you cannot hold your urine that

27:38.600 --> 27:39.600
long.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.520
It is, you're holding a toxin in your body.

27:42.520 --> 27:45.040
You can't drink that much water.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.760
Now, she deserves her Darwin Award.

27:47.760 --> 27:54.440
The DJs also, I think, were responsible for not thinking it through, for being pretty

27:54.440 --> 27:56.320
much, yeah, they were idiots.

27:56.320 --> 28:00.920
They also deserved to be Darwinized, unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet.

28:00.920 --> 28:06.880
But I don't think in kind of and sort of, I believe in every party was at fault.

28:06.880 --> 28:07.880
She was at fault.

28:07.880 --> 28:09.060
She deserves it.

28:09.060 --> 28:10.060
They were at fault.

28:10.060 --> 28:11.720
They deserve to be fired and worse.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.320
I don't think anyone deserves to die.

28:13.320 --> 28:16.280
I mean, we all do stupid shit for our kids.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.500
But you know what I mean, though?

28:17.500 --> 28:19.840
She earned her death.

28:19.840 --> 28:25.280
I just kind of think maybe she had some type of trust in the radio station that she wasn't

28:25.280 --> 28:28.720
doing it like that they hadn't already researched.

28:28.720 --> 28:33.760
They probably didn't know that it was, I mean, because it's basically okay who can hold it

28:33.760 --> 28:36.000
the longest and before they have to go.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
That wasn't the issue.

28:37.000 --> 28:42.160
It wasn't because she held back her urine that she died, it was because she drank gallons

28:42.160 --> 28:46.560
and gallons of water really quick, and it wouldn't have mattered even if she went afterwards

28:46.560 --> 28:50.680
because I'm assuming she did go afterwards, the damage was already done.

28:50.680 --> 28:53.440
The thing is, is now they had them fill out waivers.

28:53.440 --> 28:57.460
Well, they have generic waivers that the radio stations have people fill out for their contests.

28:57.460 --> 29:00.600
It's basically saying, oh, we don't hold you liable for this and this.

29:00.600 --> 29:05.360
But they didn't disclose, at least it seems like from what I've heard on the radio and

29:05.360 --> 29:11.620
stuff, the recordings of it, they didn't really disclose what possible dangers were and say,

29:11.620 --> 29:16.000
you might die from this if there's too much or something like that.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.760
I don't think they did their research, or if they did, they just completely shrugged

29:19.760 --> 29:21.160
it off.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.720
That's really what the issue is.

29:22.720 --> 29:26.820
It's not a matter of if they signed waivers or not, it's just they didn't disclose the

29:26.820 --> 29:32.800
possible risks of participating in this activity because not everyone is aware that drinking

29:32.800 --> 29:34.820
that much water could cause you to die.

29:34.820 --> 29:39.840
You would just think that you just have to really go to the bathroom really bad.

29:39.840 --> 29:44.880
With a lot of these people not knowing, you can't really hold them responsible for that.

29:44.880 --> 29:48.840
Granted, it's a stupid thing, but hey, if someone gave me the opportunity to drink some

29:48.840 --> 29:55.480
water and hold my pee for a $250 thing, sure, I'd give it a shot, but if I started feeling

29:55.480 --> 29:59.360
sick, I would stop.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.400
I think that kind of thing doesn't make you feel sick.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.440
That's kind of the difference there.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.440
I don't know.

30:03.440 --> 30:04.440
Miklotov?

30:04.440 --> 30:08.840
I thought they said that she stopped when she did feel sick.

30:08.840 --> 30:12.120
She did re-quit the contest.

30:12.120 --> 30:14.640
When I read about it, I didn't know about water poisoning.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.800
I was like, okay, that's crazy.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.200
How could you not know about it?

30:19.200 --> 30:21.900
You can drink so much water that it kills you.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.320
You're pretty much saturating.

30:23.320 --> 30:27.760
But it being a radio contest, I thought they would have taken the precautions to warn the

30:27.760 --> 30:31.920
contestants and stuff, or at least have somebody on hand.

30:31.920 --> 30:35.920
I'm not saying at all that the DJs in the station were not at fault.

30:35.920 --> 30:39.880
I'm saying that there's equal fault.

30:39.880 --> 30:44.640
Maybe everybody doesn't know that you can drink yourself of water to death.

30:44.640 --> 30:45.960
I thought it was common sense.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.600
Interesting perspective in the chat room.

30:47.600 --> 30:51.520
Mike W. says, Dark Soccer, it's not the DJ's fault for doing what his boss told him.

30:51.520 --> 30:55.080
I do agree to an extent, and that's why 10 people were fired over this.

30:55.080 --> 30:58.000
That's why certainly a lot of people, not just the DJs, were fired.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.280
But I'm telling you, if you listen to the audio, which is available on one of our local

31:02.280 --> 31:08.160
newspapers, sacb.com, has audio of the whole thing, and you listen to the DJs kind of going

31:08.160 --> 31:14.080
like, wow, you've got a really big belly, and knowing the result, you can't help but

31:14.080 --> 31:22.400
feel like, whoa, they were way too bold for the whole thing.

31:22.400 --> 31:32.060
My whole point is that anything that's going to affect the body, you really, really need

31:32.060 --> 31:35.320
to understand what the risks are before you decide to do it.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.320
That's my point.

31:36.320 --> 31:43.200
It came out more harshly than I intended it to, but I think, and I'm not saying anyone

31:43.200 --> 31:48.400
deserves to die, but I'm saying that if you die of your own ignorance, then that is on

31:48.400 --> 31:49.400
you.

31:49.400 --> 31:50.400
I'm sorry.

31:50.400 --> 31:55.360
But they did have, and I think that they should have been more than fired.

31:55.360 --> 31:57.800
I think they really need to stand trial for it.

31:57.800 --> 32:02.960
But I think that those that were in charge of the contest, they had a duty to make sure

32:02.960 --> 32:05.680
that the risks were put out there.

32:05.680 --> 32:09.680
I guess for the people who don't have common knowledge of this.

32:09.680 --> 32:10.680
All right.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.280
Well, we could talk for hours and hours about this.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.480
Hell, we did on Wednesday's show.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.240
We talked for at least an hour about this.

32:15.240 --> 32:18.460
But in the interest of getting more news, I'm directly involved with gaming.

32:18.460 --> 32:19.760
We do want to move on.

32:19.760 --> 32:23.600
We do welcome your emails and voicemails on this topic, but please keep in mind, since

32:23.600 --> 32:27.160
this is a controversial issue, we're probably not going to get to read everything we get

32:27.160 --> 32:28.160
on it.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.360
But we do welcome your thoughts.

32:29.360 --> 32:35.400
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com or our voicemail, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

32:35.400 --> 32:39.760
Let's move on and talk about some news that is definitely directly about gaming.

32:39.760 --> 32:41.000
Who's got something for us?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
I do.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
All right.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
We're going to talk about some dates here.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.280
We had a lot piling up actually in the last two weeks and even some stuff we announced

32:48.280 --> 32:52.920
on the site a little bit, but yet no one seems to be picking up on that.

32:52.920 --> 32:58.360
Lots of stuff being announced this week, especially on all the big sites.

32:58.360 --> 33:03.080
They were announcing a crazy taxi for the PSP, not a big surprise, and that's coming

33:03.080 --> 33:05.020
June 13th.

33:05.020 --> 33:12.400
Some other stuff, Two Worlds, the PS3 version, I guess, is being delayed to October 10th

33:12.400 --> 33:18.040
and then the Xbox 360 one will be coming out in May on the 16th.

33:18.040 --> 33:20.280
So that's some stuff that we probably already knew about.

33:20.280 --> 33:24.520
However, there are a lot of things that many people haven't heard about yet and some stuff

33:24.520 --> 33:27.020
that's a little bit surprising.

33:27.020 --> 33:37.000
First off here, we've got a bunch of no-brainer titles like a new bunch of movie-based stuff.

33:37.000 --> 33:45.000
Ratatouille for pretty much every system out there except for the original Xbox to tie

33:45.000 --> 33:48.600
in with the upcoming Pixar movie.

33:48.600 --> 33:54.440
Of course, we've got Surf's Up also tying with the new movie coming out and that's coming

33:54.440 --> 33:56.400
out in May.

33:56.400 --> 34:02.520
What's interesting though, beyond all that stuff and like Spider-Man 3 and Transformers

34:02.520 --> 34:07.960
and Shrek the Third, we do have some interesting stuff like Dog Island.

34:07.960 --> 34:12.760
I don't know if you remember when they were first showing off the Wii stuff in Japan.

34:12.760 --> 34:16.960
I thought it was a Hudson game but it's basically that character, the dog, where they have the

34:16.960 --> 34:24.680
super giant heads, kind of almost like, I don't know, some sort of toy thing over there.

34:24.680 --> 34:29.640
That's coming out on PlayStation 2 and the Wii, May 23rd, which is kind of interesting.

34:29.640 --> 34:34.040
Some bigger stuff though, Final Fantasy Fables, Chocable Tales, that's going to be coming

34:34.040 --> 34:36.800
out on the DS April 25th.

34:36.800 --> 34:43.200
Dawn of Mana, finally making its way out to the PlayStation 2, that's May 15th.

34:43.200 --> 34:47.680
And then of course Guitar Hero 2 for the 360 is going to be coming out at the end of March

34:47.680 --> 34:51.520
on the 28th and that's pretty big.

34:51.520 --> 34:57.360
And then some other interesting stuff, Motorstorm, MLB 07 The Show, and God of War 2 have all

34:57.360 --> 35:02.240
been delayed a month to March 14th now.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.580
So that's kind of interesting.

35:04.580 --> 35:07.400
Same with F.E.A.R. also got delayed to that time.

35:07.400 --> 35:10.960
And then of course the big one that we announced on the site, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic

35:10.960 --> 35:17.540
has been announced for the Xbox 360 and I know that was something that was being rumored

35:17.540 --> 35:23.280
to have happened ever since, actually before the 360 even came out, so it's kind of interesting

35:23.280 --> 35:25.680
there.

35:25.680 --> 35:32.200
And let's see, and then other interesting stuff, Samurai Slash, which would be Samurai

35:32.200 --> 35:37.560
Warriors, the Koei game, coming to the Wii and that's going to be May 16th.

35:37.560 --> 35:45.520
Fatal Inertia, Blade Storm, also coming out on the 360 and the PlayStation 3, April 18th,

35:45.520 --> 35:52.160
which Koei actually came out and officially said Summer, but April 18th is more accurate.

35:52.160 --> 35:57.640
Kane and Lynch, now this one I'm kind of shaking my head with, because I thought it was PlayStation

35:57.640 --> 36:03.200
3 and the 360, but we have an announcement for PlayStation 2 and the 360, so I don't know,

36:03.200 --> 36:04.700
but that's interesting.

36:04.700 --> 36:12.420
June 20th for that one, and then that's probably all the big stuff I would say.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.420
Just lots of dates.

36:13.420 --> 36:16.880
I'm going to post more on that under the radar thread though, if you want to check out the

36:16.880 --> 36:17.880
details there.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.160
You should be posting some of that to the front page, really.

36:20.160 --> 36:23.200
I've not heard of God of War being pushed back, that's news to me.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.800
Of course, I haven't been following for that story very closely.

36:25.800 --> 36:31.720
This one's kind of cool too, Senko no Rondo, for the 360, it's an Ikaruga style shooter.

36:31.720 --> 36:38.520
That's coming out May 16th as well, so yeah, lots of big stuff.

36:38.520 --> 36:43.040
Alright, well thanks for the insight, how about some, what's coming out next week?

36:43.040 --> 36:49.120
Yeah, not much, not much of anything actually.

36:49.120 --> 36:52.360
Next week is a bunch of portable games, and that's pretty much it.

36:52.360 --> 37:02.400
Let's see here, I know we've got the, what is it, Hotel 219, 213, my mistake.

37:02.400 --> 37:04.840
That's going to be coming out on the DS.

37:04.840 --> 37:09.160
Miggletop, you've been talking to me about this game a lot today, why are you so excited

37:09.160 --> 37:10.160
about it?

37:10.160 --> 37:13.880
There's a lot of people that do Trace Memory, and I love Trace Memory for the two hours

37:13.880 --> 37:21.640
that you get to play it for, and it's just like a film noir looking, oh it's 215, it's

37:21.640 --> 37:27.000
just like a film noir thing where you're like some detective guy and you hold your DS like

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
book style.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Like brain training?

37:29.000 --> 37:32.760
Yeah, and it's just an adventure game, it's great.

37:32.760 --> 37:33.760
Okay.

37:33.760 --> 37:40.280
And other stuff on the PSP, Legend of Heroes 3, Song of the Ocean, which is another edition

37:40.280 --> 37:46.520
of the RPG series, Inuyasha Secret of the Divine Jewel on the DS, Sid Meier's Pirates

37:46.520 --> 37:55.520
on the PSP, and then some PC stuff, of course we've got Europa Universal's 3, another strategy

37:55.520 --> 38:02.040
game, and Alien Shooter Vengeance on the PC, and then Sam and Max Episode 3, The Mole,

38:02.040 --> 38:04.640
The Mob, and The Meatball.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.840
More episodic content for you.

38:06.840 --> 38:07.840
Alright.

38:07.840 --> 38:13.520
Well, I have our UK release dates, if anybody is interested.

38:13.520 --> 38:22.120
On the 26th coming out is Arthur and the Minimoys on DS PC, PSP and GBA and PlayStation 2, Pro

38:22.120 --> 38:30.360
Evolution Soccer 6 on DS, Star Fox Command on DS, World Snooker, it says Snooker, Championship

38:30.360 --> 38:39.280
2007 on PSP by Sega, SOCOM US Navy Seals combined assault on PlayStation 2, and SOCOM US Navy

38:39.280 --> 38:47.920
Seals Fire Team Bravo 2 on PSP, and Wild Arms XF, those last three are all on the 27th,

38:47.920 --> 38:50.960
and Wild Arms XF is pretty cool.

38:50.960 --> 38:53.280
So those are coming out.

38:53.280 --> 38:54.280
Very cool.

38:54.280 --> 38:58.200
You know, speaking of UK, you know our opening story, the controversial one this evening,

38:58.200 --> 39:00.820
you know how I knew that was big news?

39:00.820 --> 39:08.940
When I saw it on BBC News, that's when I was like, wow, if you didn't know about the don't

39:08.940 --> 39:12.920
drink water and don't go to the bathroom thing before, you sure as hell will now, everybody

39:12.920 --> 39:13.920
in the world will know it.

39:13.920 --> 39:20.440
It's something else, especially when people are making jokes about it, and they can't

39:20.440 --> 39:24.980
revert back to that story, got to move on to dates, because the folks in Japan want

39:24.980 --> 39:27.080
to know what's coming out over there.

39:27.080 --> 39:30.820
Even if you don't live in Japan, certainly the things that come out in Japan typically

39:30.820 --> 39:35.440
will come out here a little later, or sometimes vice versa when the title came out in America

39:35.440 --> 39:39.980
first, such as The Godfather, which is now making its way over to Japan on Xbox 360 on

39:39.980 --> 39:47.420
January 25th, also coming out The Idolmaster on 360, and Vampire's Reign from AQ Interactive,

39:47.420 --> 39:53.380
another title getting localized for Japan from its US release, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw,

39:53.380 --> 39:56.080
coming out from THQ this week in Japan.

39:56.080 --> 40:00.920
Over on PlayStation 3, Enchanted Arms, or as they call it in Japan, Enchant Arm, coming

40:00.920 --> 40:05.500
out January 25th, so it should be interesting to see how that compares to the 360 version.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.820
We'll hear a little more about that this week.

40:07.820 --> 40:12.520
Also moving on to the Nintendo Wii, there's a Mahjong title, Mahjong Takai Wii, coming

40:12.520 --> 40:16.540
out from Koei Entertainment on the 25th in Japan.

40:16.540 --> 40:22.700
Over on the PlayStation 2, you get Final Fantasy X International and Final Fantasy X-2 International

40:22.700 --> 40:27.420
moving into the Ultimate Hits, that just basically means they get a little bit cheaper.

40:27.420 --> 40:31.940
But a big, big title, maybe not so much in Japan as it was here, but Grand Theft Auto

40:31.940 --> 40:33.700
San Andreas is coming out.

40:33.700 --> 40:37.500
I thought this was interesting from Capcom over in Japan, so it's kind of interesting

40:37.500 --> 40:43.700
how things kind of shift around to get releases other places, because that happens sometimes.

40:43.700 --> 40:51.100
Capcom also releasing Hyper Street Fighter II, the anniversary collection, and also another

40:51.100 --> 40:55.500
big, big title coming out for folks who listen to this program I know for a long time, Dance

40:55.500 --> 41:02.740
Dance Revolution Supernova finally getting its Japanese release on the 25th of January.

41:02.740 --> 41:08.120
And also coming out for the PS2, its own version of SmackDown vs. Raw, and I like this title.

41:08.120 --> 41:13.660
For Marvelous Entertainment, you're getting Kuji Biki Ambulance coming out.

41:13.660 --> 41:21.180
Also a Naruto title, Naruto Team at Hero 3 moves into the best collection, because Naruto

41:21.180 --> 41:22.180
titles, I guess, sell like crazy.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.740
I don't know, I've never played one.

41:23.740 --> 41:30.140
On the Nintendo DS, Biohazard Deadly Silence moves into the best price, which, sorry, Deadly

41:30.140 --> 41:31.740
Silence, did I say Death Science?

41:31.740 --> 41:34.820
Biohazard, of course, is Resident Evil.

41:34.820 --> 41:40.940
And P-Cross DS comes out from Nintendo itself over on the Nintendo DS, also another game

41:40.940 --> 41:42.340
coming out from Nintendo.

41:42.340 --> 41:48.140
Wish Room, Tenshi no Kyoku, coming out this week in Japan.

41:48.140 --> 41:50.340
Is that just the hotel game localized over there?

41:50.340 --> 41:51.340
Oh, great.

41:51.340 --> 41:53.620
And this is pretty cool, Dark Soccer, you'll like this.

41:53.620 --> 41:58.340
Coming out on the PSP, Parodius Portable makes its way to the PSP.

41:58.340 --> 41:59.580
I know you're a big fan of Parodius.

41:59.580 --> 42:02.340
That was like, wasn't that the Parodius collection or something?

42:02.340 --> 42:03.460
I believe it is.

42:03.460 --> 42:04.460
I believe it is.

42:04.460 --> 42:05.460
I love Parodius!

42:05.460 --> 42:06.460
Oh, it's interesting.

42:06.460 --> 42:10.180
Well, yeah, and also the Salamander collection, Salamander Portable is coming out this week

42:10.180 --> 42:11.180
as well.

42:11.180 --> 42:13.660
We're just talking about Salamander and Life Force 2 this morning.

42:13.660 --> 42:17.660
And Gradius moves into the best, so a big week if you're a Gradius fan over in Japan.

42:17.660 --> 42:22.300
So while it may be a slow week here in the U.S. and U.K., it's a busy week over there

42:22.300 --> 42:23.300
in Japan.

42:23.300 --> 42:29.500
I'd like to mention, though, this week they did announce, or it was on all the other sites

42:29.500 --> 42:32.820
out there, that Driver was making its way to the Wii.

42:32.820 --> 42:35.820
I just thought that was funny as well.

42:35.820 --> 42:38.420
And that's what you had mentioned here on this program about five weeks ago, right?

42:38.420 --> 42:39.420
Yeah, something like that.

42:39.420 --> 42:40.420
I'm just curious.

42:40.420 --> 42:44.540
You know, we do report a lot of these dates and no one seems to pick up onto it until

42:44.540 --> 42:48.420
there is an official press release, so I told you so.

42:48.420 --> 42:51.420
Shadow Charlie seems to enjoy Parodius as well.

42:51.420 --> 42:55.380
Parodius has some badass music, says Shadow Charlie.

42:55.380 --> 42:58.380
And Shadow Charlie also wants to know, is DDR Universe out yet?

42:58.380 --> 42:59.900
And the answer is no.

42:59.900 --> 43:03.840
So those that were thinking it's coming out in January, looks like it really was March.

43:03.840 --> 43:06.940
After all, Loki wins again.

43:06.940 --> 43:12.180
Well, we have a little bit more news as far as things that are going to be playable this

43:12.180 --> 43:13.180
year.

43:13.180 --> 43:15.940
The Final Fantasy XIII demo is due out.

43:15.940 --> 43:21.420
They said ready for E3 in 2007.

43:21.420 --> 43:26.900
I'm not sure which one I guess they mean, because given that there's multiple Final

43:26.900 --> 43:34.980
Fantasy XIIIs going on, two of them going on with Squeenix, I'm not sure if they mean

43:34.980 --> 43:36.940
both or just one or the other of them.

43:36.940 --> 43:41.300
They should do 13 versions of that, you know, that would make sense.

43:41.300 --> 43:42.300
They probably will eventually.

43:42.300 --> 43:43.300
That would make me cry.

43:43.300 --> 43:47.260
We've already got, what, 13 versions of Final Fantasy VII, practically.

43:47.260 --> 43:49.620
I don't even feel like counting.

43:49.620 --> 43:54.740
Or 13 versions of Final Fantasy I, as we're going to find out later in the program.

43:54.740 --> 43:59.700
But at any rate, the two are going to...

43:59.700 --> 44:05.420
I love Latin, fabula nova crystallis, that just sounds cool, the new tale of the crystal.

44:05.420 --> 44:07.220
Pretty cool.

44:07.220 --> 44:12.180
Kind of interesting, especially when folks are saying that the PlayStation 3 really needs

44:12.180 --> 44:14.140
like its big title right now.

44:14.140 --> 44:18.060
So it's kind of interesting how this Final Fantasy XIII news is kind of slowly leaking

44:18.060 --> 44:19.060
out, right?

44:19.060 --> 44:20.580
Well, you know what they need?

44:20.580 --> 44:22.500
It's just like Final Fantasy VII for the PlayStation.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.780
I mean, hell, I bought that system for that game.

44:24.780 --> 44:25.780
That's true.

44:25.780 --> 44:27.580
I did not buy a PlayStation until Final Fantasy VII.

44:27.580 --> 44:31.860
And you know what, I have to admit, Final Fantasy XIII, especially depending on this

44:31.860 --> 44:36.420
demo after I play the demo, will probably be the thing that finally breaks me to get

44:36.420 --> 44:37.420
a PlayStation 3.

44:37.420 --> 44:41.020
Because I'm the only OLR host that doesn't own one.

44:41.020 --> 44:42.420
But I'm poor.

44:42.420 --> 44:45.820
Anyways, so more on Final Fantasy XIII.

44:45.820 --> 44:49.420
It's been leaked out by Famitsu and Dengeki.

44:49.420 --> 44:55.100
Some stuff they're talking about, I guess, from the playable demo, including apparently

44:55.100 --> 45:00.540
it's going to have a really awesome opening scene that says probably the most intense

45:00.540 --> 45:05.940
in the Final Fantasy series, which seems to be like every other game does that.

45:05.940 --> 45:10.820
And then, of course, they were talking about, I guess, one of the main characters, the blonde

45:10.820 --> 45:13.260
guy that you see in all the trailers.

45:13.260 --> 45:15.500
Apparently it's going to be pretty big.

45:15.500 --> 45:18.860
He's going to be large enough to run around carrying two people.

45:18.860 --> 45:20.780
And they said his shoe size will be 33 centimeters.

45:20.780 --> 45:23.020
I wonder what the fuck that's supposed to mean.

45:23.020 --> 45:25.740
Who gives a shit about fictional characters' shoe sizes?

45:25.740 --> 45:28.820
I guess that means his penis is going to be huge too.

45:28.820 --> 45:29.820
But whatever.

45:29.820 --> 45:35.740
So hopefully we'll get some more important information on Final Fantasy XIII coming soon,

45:35.740 --> 45:38.220
other than shoe sizes.

45:38.220 --> 45:39.220
We need bust sizes.

45:39.220 --> 45:40.220
That's what we need.

45:40.220 --> 45:41.220
Where's that information?

45:41.220 --> 45:45.820
Well, I'm definitely looking forward to more and more information on Final Fantasy XIII.

45:45.820 --> 45:51.900
Being the self-confessed Final Fantasy fanboy I am, I'm personally very excited for all

45:51.900 --> 45:52.900
the latest.

45:52.900 --> 45:56.040
We'll see hopefully more in the next few weeks.

45:56.040 --> 45:58.980
More things that Japan is seeing is apparently PlayStation 3.

45:58.980 --> 46:03.740
Sony put out a release this week that says they have sold one million of the machines.

46:03.740 --> 46:04.740
I'm sorry.

46:04.740 --> 46:05.740
I'm sorry.

46:05.740 --> 46:06.740
Wait.

46:06.740 --> 46:07.740
Key difference here.

46:07.740 --> 46:08.740
They have shipped one million machines in Japan.

46:08.740 --> 46:09.740
Sorry there.

46:09.740 --> 46:10.740
I'm so tired of these.

46:10.740 --> 46:11.740
See, I almost fell for the trick there.

46:11.740 --> 46:12.740
That's what they're trying to get you to think.

46:12.740 --> 46:14.700
I am so tired of these fucking companies doing this shit.

46:14.700 --> 46:16.220
Oh, we've shipped them.

46:16.220 --> 46:17.220
Good for you.

46:17.220 --> 46:18.220
I've taken a shit too.

46:18.220 --> 46:19.980
I mean, do you want news on that too?

46:19.980 --> 46:23.740
I mean, seriously, so you shipped that many.

46:23.740 --> 46:27.980
Why don't they say they've manufactured that many or thought about manufacturing that many?

46:27.980 --> 46:33.860
It should be interesting to note that Sony only actually sold about 470,000 at the end

46:33.860 --> 46:34.860
of 2006.

46:34.860 --> 46:36.340
That was their year's end sale figure.

46:36.340 --> 46:39.780
So it's kind of interesting that this release comes out now and says, oh, we've actually

46:39.780 --> 46:41.220
shipped a million.

46:41.220 --> 46:45.860
So does that mean that half of them are sitting on shelves?

46:45.860 --> 46:47.300
They're shitting on the seashore.

46:47.300 --> 46:51.060
I've got dyslexia of the mouth today.

46:51.060 --> 46:52.060
I don't know what it is.

46:52.060 --> 46:53.780
I'm combining words that don't need to be combined.

46:53.780 --> 46:54.900
I don't know what's wrong today.

46:54.900 --> 46:56.900
I apologize, folks.

46:56.900 --> 46:59.940
Amateur radio at its finest.

46:59.940 --> 47:03.460
Maybe this is why we don't get paid to do what we do.

47:03.460 --> 47:11.180
Should you have a half a million of them sitting on the store shelves or have they moved a

47:11.180 --> 47:14.540
whole bunch in the last two weeks that they've now shipped more to compensate for that?

47:14.540 --> 47:15.540
I don't really know.

47:15.540 --> 47:16.540
You have to understand.

47:16.540 --> 47:22.620
They've moved more units to the stores to allow for more elaborate towers to be made

47:22.620 --> 47:30.820
out of the units that no one's buying, including castles and the traditional Christmas tree

47:30.820 --> 47:33.460
tower type thing.

47:33.460 --> 47:38.260
It should be noted that now they have achieved their goal of shipping two million units worldwide

47:38.260 --> 47:43.700
about two weeks late from the deadline, but keep in mind that was a goal that got smaller

47:43.700 --> 47:45.020
and smaller before the PS3's release.

47:45.020 --> 47:47.420
Wasn't there gold to sell that many units?

47:47.420 --> 47:48.700
I don't know.

47:48.700 --> 47:53.460
So now they're saying six million at the end of March they will ship.

47:53.460 --> 48:00.060
I'm glad to see that they were able to hit their twice-adjusted goal two weeks late.

48:00.060 --> 48:01.060
Way to go, Sony.

48:01.060 --> 48:03.260
Hey, look, I don't write it.

48:03.260 --> 48:04.260
I just report on it.

48:04.260 --> 48:05.380
There you go.

48:05.380 --> 48:07.180
I don't know what else to tell you.

48:07.180 --> 48:08.540
I know what else to tell people.

48:08.540 --> 48:09.540
What's that?

48:09.540 --> 48:16.220
Apparently, it's been listed that the PlayStation 3 is going to be more expensive in Ireland,

48:16.220 --> 48:19.340
and I don't know why.

48:19.340 --> 48:26.620
It was actually listed on This Is Living that the price of the PlayStation 3 in Ireland

48:26.620 --> 48:36.100
is going to be 629.99 euros instead of the announced stuff, 5.99.

48:36.100 --> 48:45.580
The speculation is that it actually is going to be an increase all over Europe, but just

48:45.580 --> 48:49.180
that Ireland got the update first.

48:49.180 --> 48:54.820
I really hope that it's not true, that they keep it the 5.99 because that's going to piss

48:54.820 --> 48:56.060
off a lot of people.

48:56.060 --> 49:00.420
I heard it was because of the higher VAT prices in Ireland.

49:00.420 --> 49:04.180
Now Seisha is one of our UK listeners, and he's in chat right now saying it's not just

49:04.180 --> 49:08.300
Ireland but the entirety of the UK as well.

49:08.300 --> 49:20.820
Has Sony even officially confirmed anything?

49:20.820 --> 49:24.540
We still don't have a firm date for the UK, do we?

49:24.540 --> 49:28.180
They've confirmed non-confirmation.

49:28.180 --> 49:31.700
So does this mean we don't really know anything, or what's it boiled down to?

49:31.700 --> 49:37.820
It means that they're shipping units some day, some amount.

49:37.820 --> 49:42.460
Actually, there is a posted update.

49:42.460 --> 49:45.740
That's exactly why it did increase.

49:45.740 --> 49:53.580
For the rest of everybody else, it's going to be 5.99 for the 60 and 4.25 for the...

49:53.580 --> 49:55.660
Damn you Ireland, setting the bar for everyone else.

49:55.660 --> 49:57.300
Just buy the 20.

49:57.300 --> 49:59.300
You really don't need the 60.

49:59.300 --> 50:00.300
Really?

50:00.300 --> 50:01.300
I have the 60.

50:01.300 --> 50:02.300
It's on HDMI.

50:02.300 --> 50:06.140
So is HDMI that important, what do you guys think?

50:06.140 --> 50:07.780
It's on both units.

50:07.780 --> 50:10.260
I thought that was a big thing, that it wasn't going to be on the 20 gig.

50:10.260 --> 50:11.540
Yeah, then they changed that.

50:11.540 --> 50:12.540
Really?

50:12.540 --> 50:13.540
Yeah, it's on both units.

50:13.540 --> 50:14.540
I didn't get that memo.

50:14.540 --> 50:15.540
Oh, it's still stupid.

50:15.540 --> 50:16.540
I have the 60 and I like it.

50:16.540 --> 50:17.540
Oh, we'll see.

50:17.540 --> 50:18.540
I don't know.

50:18.540 --> 50:22.420
I'm running out of room on the 360 with the 20 gig, so maybe I want...

50:22.420 --> 50:23.420
Well, you can always upgrade, remember?

50:23.420 --> 50:24.420
Nah, we'll see.

50:24.420 --> 50:25.420
I don't know.

50:25.420 --> 50:29.380
Of course, those hard drives, the two and a half inch SATA drives are fucking expensive,

50:29.380 --> 50:30.380
but whatever.

50:30.380 --> 50:31.380
I have no decision on what I want to do yet.

50:31.380 --> 50:32.380
I'm too poor.

50:32.380 --> 50:33.380
I know that much.

50:33.380 --> 50:38.740
But you know, one reason you might want to upgrade that 2.5 inch SATA drive in your PS3

50:38.740 --> 50:44.500
is to run MythTV on it, because if you install the second operating system or Linux on your

50:44.500 --> 50:50.060
other partition, there is actually a way now to get MythTV to run.

50:50.060 --> 50:58.120
Using a USB TV tuner and a wonderful set of homemade drivers for it, you too can run the

50:58.120 --> 51:04.580
wonderful TVR software to be able to record your favorite shows and dump them onto your

51:04.580 --> 51:09.340
hopefully larger hard drive, so that's pretty cool.

51:09.340 --> 51:11.780
And I don't know.

51:11.780 --> 51:15.780
I might try that, since I don't really have room on my other drive, although I need to

51:15.780 --> 51:20.100
get a capture card for that, but hey, that's great.

51:20.100 --> 51:26.300
Well, from one TV-enabled system to another, let's go over to Microsoft IPTV.

51:26.300 --> 51:30.740
Of course, this was announced at CES, and details are starting to fill in.

51:30.740 --> 51:36.500
I have a lengthy quote here from the Microsoft TV site of what exactly this thing does.

51:36.500 --> 51:41.700
Quote, Microsoft IPTV edition is an integrated and comprehensive software platform developed

51:41.700 --> 51:46.020
specifically to deliver broadcast quality video and new integrated TV services over

51:46.020 --> 51:47.420
broadband networks.

51:47.420 --> 51:52.340
The platform combines market-leading features such as instant channel change, ICC, and multiple

51:52.340 --> 52:00.020
picture-in-picture with traditional TV services such as broadcast, programming, VOD, and DVR.

52:00.020 --> 52:04.660
The software is developed to integrate seamlessly and economically with other IP-based communications

52:04.660 --> 52:08.900
and media services for PCs, phones, and other consumer devices.

52:08.900 --> 52:14.580
Microsoft IPTV edition is ideal for telecommunications carriers and for cable operators looking to

52:14.580 --> 52:18.560
deliver differentiated TV services and experiences.

52:18.560 --> 52:21.740
And for what I've been picking else out there on the Internet, it does sound like if you

52:21.740 --> 52:26.300
want to have this, this is not just something you're going to simply download it or just

52:26.300 --> 52:29.620
plug on to your Xbox 360 and boom, you get TV through your 360.

52:29.620 --> 52:30.620
Oh, no, no, no, no.

52:30.620 --> 52:36.020
You're going to have to switch up your cable provider who therefore will also provide your

52:36.020 --> 52:37.660
Internet and so on and so on.

52:37.660 --> 52:42.780
You're really going to have to make an adjustment change when it comes to how your services

52:42.780 --> 52:47.580
such as Internet and TV are provided in your house.

52:47.580 --> 52:51.740
If people are thinking, oh, this is just some cool little enhancement of 360, it's a little

52:51.740 --> 52:53.340
more than that.

52:53.340 --> 53:00.200
It kind of makes me think almost like Microsoft is now becoming like a rival to satellite

53:00.200 --> 53:01.200
in a way.

53:01.200 --> 53:02.200
I don't know.

53:02.200 --> 53:03.200
Maybe that's a little bit far-fetched.

53:03.200 --> 53:04.200
It's not the best way to phrase it.

53:04.200 --> 53:05.200
I don't know.

53:05.200 --> 53:06.200
What do you guys think?

53:06.200 --> 53:07.200
Is this something you might be interested in checking out?

53:07.200 --> 53:08.940
I want to check it out, definitely.

53:08.940 --> 53:09.940
Would you make that change?

53:09.940 --> 53:11.940
Would you get rid of what you have now for this?

53:11.940 --> 53:12.940
What I have?

53:12.940 --> 53:13.940
Yeah.

53:13.940 --> 53:15.060
Cable is fucking too expensive.

53:15.060 --> 53:18.300
If it had some good programming on it, hell yeah.

53:18.300 --> 53:22.700
If it had everything, although I imagine IPTV doesn't probably have everything, yeah, it

53:22.700 --> 53:26.580
might have some specific channels.

53:26.580 --> 53:34.420
If anything, it would be a good addition to if not replacing my current TV, although my

53:34.420 --> 53:37.740
current TV is expensive and I hate it.

53:37.740 --> 53:41.340
I'm looking at some comments from Chat Room, chat.orangelunge.com.

53:41.340 --> 53:44.260
Black Boy says, basically the 360 becomes a cable box.

53:44.260 --> 53:46.540
I guess that's one way you can think of it.

53:46.540 --> 53:51.580
I think it's a waste.

53:51.580 --> 53:55.140
This is Microsoft doing the Trojan horse thing and they've openly admitted that they did

53:55.140 --> 54:02.000
not put out the 360 to do just gaming and now it sounds to me like cable versus satellite

54:02.000 --> 54:03.580
versus the 360.

54:03.580 --> 54:09.220
Or you can do what I do and that's not watch TV and get a life.

54:09.220 --> 54:10.460
You watch Doctor Who.

54:10.460 --> 54:15.100
I download it off the internet, watch it at my convenience and then go outside.

54:15.100 --> 54:17.460
So there is some television you watch, at least one thing.

54:17.460 --> 54:18.460
But I don't use my television.

54:18.460 --> 54:19.500
And Torchwood, you watch that too.

54:19.500 --> 54:21.380
I don't need cable.

54:21.380 --> 54:26.180
But with the IPTV, granted you don't live in the UK, if there were any U.S. shows that

54:26.180 --> 54:28.980
you watched, I know they re-brought Heroes tomorrow.

54:28.980 --> 54:31.980
At all worth watching on television in the United States.

54:31.980 --> 54:35.420
Are you going to watch Heroes tomorrow with Doctor Nine?

54:35.420 --> 54:36.420
Probably not actually.

54:36.420 --> 54:38.340
I'm going to be in school.

54:38.340 --> 54:39.340
Let me down.

54:39.340 --> 54:43.020
I'll watch the other episodes and then watch that at my own convenience.

54:43.020 --> 54:44.020
All right.

54:44.020 --> 54:45.020
All right, whatever.

54:45.020 --> 54:48.380
There's no way we move over.

54:48.380 --> 54:54.300
The thing is I don't see why people are so obsessed with television anyway.

54:54.300 --> 54:56.700
People get obsessed over movies.

54:56.700 --> 54:58.620
Silent Hill, Jamie.

54:58.620 --> 55:02.180
I saw it four times and then they saw it.

55:02.180 --> 55:03.820
So it's just another type of entertainment.

55:03.820 --> 55:07.020
It was another thing that was at my convenience.

55:07.020 --> 55:12.380
I think if I got anything for TV, I'd definitely have a DVR, but other than that.

55:12.380 --> 55:16.660
And then that's kind of what IPTV is, DVR, video on demand, all that crap.

55:16.660 --> 55:22.300
I just don't think that we need anything else contributing to the couch potato mentality.

55:22.300 --> 55:24.540
But there are educational things on TV.

55:24.540 --> 55:27.640
Heck, over at Loki's last night we were watching on Discovery Health, this whole special on

55:27.640 --> 55:29.900
people going through transgender surgery.

55:29.900 --> 55:34.460
And there was this post-op chick who was walking around with a shirt off on the beach, looked

55:34.460 --> 55:35.700
just like a dude.

55:35.700 --> 55:37.020
Very educational.

55:37.020 --> 55:38.020
Very educational.

55:38.020 --> 55:41.860
There's also make YouTube that has all that on it too.

55:41.860 --> 55:44.740
And I can go to school.

55:44.740 --> 55:46.540
Something else I wanted to mention.

55:46.540 --> 55:48.620
Somebody was saying they weren't interested.

55:48.620 --> 55:52.420
JV Mon in chat says, IPTV seems unattractive to me.

55:52.420 --> 55:54.900
I feel like I don't know enough about it yet.

55:54.900 --> 55:59.620
I realize CES is kind of a very high level thing for tech heads and things of that nature.

55:59.620 --> 56:03.140
I need a brochure that's dumbed down for me to explain exactly what I'm going to have

56:03.140 --> 56:07.540
to change and what I'm going to have to pay to get this and why I should do it.

56:07.540 --> 56:09.260
But again, for me it comes down to channels.

56:09.260 --> 56:14.320
If it had some pretty good HD channels, because that's what my current cable provider is severely

56:14.320 --> 56:18.260
lacking is we have like five HD channels and there's way more out there.

56:18.260 --> 56:21.900
I know there's others out there and HD is pretty.

56:21.900 --> 56:24.020
Raven's Dolphin agrees with the YouTube thing.

56:24.020 --> 56:26.020
Long live YouTube.

56:26.020 --> 56:29.300
There you go.

56:29.300 --> 56:39.700
Moving on, we watched YouTube last night on the Wii and laser cats.

56:39.700 --> 56:43.860
We were watching Jesus Christ Super Cop today on the Wii.

56:43.860 --> 56:48.380
They were watching some spider video where somebody dubbed over one of those Discovery

56:48.380 --> 56:52.540
Channel things on spiders and made it sound like one spider got a restraining order on

56:52.540 --> 56:53.540
the other.

56:53.540 --> 56:54.540
I don't know.

56:54.540 --> 56:55.540
I only watched like five minutes.

56:55.540 --> 56:56.540
What happens when spiders are on drugs?

56:56.540 --> 56:57.540
So how about some Halo?

56:57.540 --> 56:58.540
Yeah, how about some Halo?

56:58.540 --> 57:02.540
They have actually released some details about the assault rifle, which I guess some people

57:02.540 --> 57:04.860
care about.

57:04.860 --> 57:14.420
The assault rifle in Halo 3 is the MA-5C assault rifle that is a return of one that they removed

57:14.420 --> 57:15.420
from Halo 2.

57:15.420 --> 57:17.780
They didn't have any Halo 2.

57:17.780 --> 57:22.300
The power level is going to be somewhere between the original one and the BR-55 battle rifle

57:22.300 --> 57:23.940
from Halo 2.

57:23.940 --> 57:26.900
You can use the butt as a melee weapon apart from that.

57:26.900 --> 57:32.220
Just the thing that I thought was very funny is how they described it was the MA-5C is

57:32.220 --> 57:35.300
built like a breakout house with Venetian blinds.

57:35.300 --> 57:36.820
That just made me laugh.

57:36.820 --> 57:40.020
Are you going to play some Halo 3 Dark Sakura?

57:40.020 --> 57:42.020
No, get motion sick.

57:42.020 --> 57:44.700
But you get to blow stuff up?

57:44.700 --> 57:48.460
Yeah, I can play Bomberman.

57:48.460 --> 57:49.460
I don't know.

57:49.460 --> 57:54.280
The thing is that I really don't have to play these games because Dan plays them and I could

57:54.280 --> 57:59.940
go read a book and hear the explosions while I'm reading my book.

57:59.940 --> 58:01.340
I get the best of both worlds.

58:01.340 --> 58:07.460
Sometimes I wonder why you're on this program, but then I remember there are those cutesy

58:07.460 --> 58:14.740
games that you are into that none of the rest of us have heard of, so I guess there's that.

58:14.740 --> 58:17.300
The Halo franchise really isn't that bad.

58:17.300 --> 58:21.820
It's just that it's not my thing.

58:21.820 --> 58:26.180
That's understandable because I know a lot of people who aren't into Halo, but me?

58:26.180 --> 58:27.580
I've been getting back into Halo 2 lately.

58:27.580 --> 58:30.980
I did try.

58:30.980 --> 58:35.940
If somebody I know is into a game, I think that it's worth playing once before I reserve

58:35.940 --> 58:40.680
my judgment for it, but I have the same problem with that that I found out a long time ago

58:40.680 --> 58:45.260
that I have with Goldeneye with almost any first person shooter.

58:45.260 --> 58:48.660
It makes me so motion sick that I can't.

58:48.660 --> 58:50.380
Katamari makes me motion sick.

58:50.380 --> 58:55.020
However, it's on crack and has enough in it that makes me be able to stand playing a couple

58:55.020 --> 58:56.020
of games.

58:56.020 --> 59:03.460
Can you imagine how insane Katamari would be if the Sonic team was behind it?

59:03.460 --> 59:05.620
That would be super fast.

59:05.620 --> 59:07.260
No, because they'd fuck it up.

59:07.260 --> 59:08.260
Oh, that's right.

59:08.260 --> 59:09.700
You wouldn't be able to control it correctly.

59:09.700 --> 59:10.700
Exactly.

59:10.700 --> 59:11.700
No, no, no, no.

59:11.700 --> 59:17.140
I think the Sonic team debate will go for another show.

59:17.140 --> 59:23.340
Anywho, as if it's a huge surprise or anything, because I know it's not for me.

59:23.340 --> 59:28.140
The Halo 3 beta, since it's being included in Crackdown, well, they've sold about another

59:28.140 --> 59:31.500
25% more of Crackdown than they would have normally had.

59:31.500 --> 59:33.580
Yeah, big surprise there.

59:33.580 --> 59:37.220
People aren't going to buy Crackdown just because of the Halo 3 beta in there.

59:37.220 --> 59:39.780
To be honest though, Crackdown's an awesome game.

59:39.780 --> 59:43.620
The demo's coming out on Tuesday, so I highly recommend checking it out if you have Xbox

59:43.620 --> 59:49.100
Live, definitely worth it.

59:49.100 --> 59:54.420
As Loki previously reported, Major Nelson confirmed that Crackdown demo will be hitting

59:54.420 --> 59:59.220
Xbox Live on Tuesday, and Loki gets a big finger from me for stealing my story.

59:59.220 --> 01:00:00.440
Thanks a lot.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.220
Check it out, Tuesday at 2 o'clock Pacific Time.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:07.180
But I guess I could take this opportunity to point out, he doesn't often announce demos

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:12.320
in advance, so usually they announce them once they've already hit or news leaks out

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:17.220
and most Microsoft rumors are true anyway, so I don't know.

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:20.980
But regardless, since I don't know much about Crackdown, but I keep hearing Loki rave about

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:24.300
it, which is fascinating because he's never played it, I definitely want to check out

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:25.300
the demo.

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:28.540
It's like Grand Theft Auto, but okay, here's why Crackdown's awesome.

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:33.020
It's like Grand Theft Auto, but you're like a super-powered hero guy, and basically you

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:37.580
can, for example, kill somebody, throw them in the air, fire rockets, and juggle them

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.900
off the rockets in the air.

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.300
You can get achievements for that, by the way.

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:45.660
You can jump from buildings, you know, building to building, you can throw cars at people.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:49.500
When you get into a car, it becomes like the super-charged Batmobile type thing.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.020
Can you sleep with a hooker, then shoot them?

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.460
I don't know if you can sleep with hookers.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:54.460
Not interested.

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:57.260
But you can probably throw hookers in the buildings, and that's just as cool.

01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:00.260
Okay, now my interest is back, we'll see.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.700
It's got two-player co-op over live.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:03.700
Okay, alright.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:04.700
See, that would be fun.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:08.860
I will check out the demo just for you, Loki, and give my thoughts on next week's edition.

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.380
We'll play multiplayer.

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:12.660
Alright, will the demo have multiplayer?

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.660
Yes.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:14.660
Oh, sweet!

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:15.660
I'm all about that.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:16.660
Can I throw you into a building?

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:17.980
Because I've been wanting to do that for a long time.

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:18.980
Maybe.

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:19.980
Alright!

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:20.980
Sign me up!

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:21.980
I should pre-order it tomorrow.

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:26.220
Then I can be in the Halo 3 beta, like all the cool kids.

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:29.900
You can be in the cool kids club for lots of other things, Rob.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:30.900
Like what?

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:37.360
Um, like your idea for getting fast passes while we were in the line for Space Mountain.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.360
So we could ride it again?

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.360
Yeah, I know.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.220
And then getting fast passes for when we go back for my birthday.

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:43.220
I'm smart.

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.220
I'm smart like that.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:47.820
Well, here's some cool stuff.

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:59.180
For anyone who is into Luminous Live, there will be three goodies coming out on Wednesday.

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:03.520
It's actually three downloadable packages that are going to be available January 24th

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:08.820
at 1 a.m. Pacific time.

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:15.260
Two of them are add-on packs, and then there's one for free, but only for Xbox Live Gold

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:16.260
members.

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.780
That would be the Heavenly Star pack.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:23.060
Yes, which I am so, you know, I would get Luminous Live just to get the Heavenly Star

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:24.060
pack.

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:28.580
Yes, and this gives me another excuse to play this song on our little program here, a little

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.620
clip from it, because I freaking love this song, and I think it's going to be awesome

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:32.620
to play.

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.620
That's what I called it.

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:34.620
I put it on my Micey.

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:45.940
Oh, somebody in chat is saying there's new...

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:49.460
Alpha Canagram says, I want the new Genki Rockets remixes on iTunes.

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:50.460
What?

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:51.460
What?

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:52.460
I have iTunes open right now.

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:53.460
I'm going to look at that crap.

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.460
Rob, show.

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.180
I do not see remixes on iTunes.

01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:57.180
This is lies.

01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.180
Lies.

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.180
Maybe they're in the UK store or something.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.180
Show.

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:02.180
I don't know.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:05.980
I do want to go back and read some chat comments, some other things in chat.

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:09.940
Jeremy Todd 1 was saying about the Crackdown demo, Loki, some people who have played it

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:14.380
were saying it's more like Spiderman 2 or that Hulk Ultimate Destruction game more than

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:16.900
GTA.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.460
And Blaze says, this is how the demo is going to go down.

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:22.180
Loki kills everything, Rob goes and picks a flower.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.060
Look, screw you, buddy, okay?

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.060
Look, no.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.060
No.

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:29.460
When I played the Superman Returns demo, which the only thing I got a thrill out of in that

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:33.860
demo was I went and I picked up a woman and then I flew to the beach and left her and

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.860
I was like, bye, bitch.

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:35.860
I flew away.

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:36.860
My favorite was that.

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:40.700
If you don't think I can be sadistic in those types of games, you are way wrong.

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.340
You got the wrong impression of me, buddy.

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.780
You missed the best part in the game, though.

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:48.340
You pick up a car and you fly really high because you can't really blow up the car.

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:51.740
You could drop the car, though, and then it just falls and explodes.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:52.740
Really?

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.420
I should re-download the demo just to do that.

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:55.420
It's hilarious.

01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:56.420
I'm not going to buy the game.

01:03:56.420 --> 01:04:00.460
Do you get achievements, maybe, for that because maybe I could gamefly it or something.

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.460
I need to get a gamefly account.

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.460
It's one of those companies.

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:03.460
I don't know if I'll go with them.

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:08.180
It's a horrible, horrible game, but anyways, one game that's not so horrible, although

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:13.340
some people may think it's horrible, is this game called Boom Boom Rocket, which is being

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.460
put out by Bazaar.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:23.060
It resembles very closely Phantom Vision and actually almost looks like kind of DDR across

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.060
with Phantom Vision.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:27.300
I'm not sure how you would play the game.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.300
I don't know.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:29.300
It looks pretty awesome.

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:35.220
You basically will be blowing up fireworks to time with ten original tracks that they're

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:36.220
going to be having.

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:42.020
It's going to be published by EA and hopefully it will be downloadable soon.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.020
So I don't know.

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:46.820
It looks pretty cool from the screenshots I've seen of it so far.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.820
It looks pretty sexy.

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:48.820
I don't know.

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:51.220
I heard it just looks like Phantom Vision.

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.340
Oh, there's actual screenshots of it now?

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:56.100
It looks just like Phantom Vision and kind of like DDR.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.300
Oh, it does look kind of like DDR.

01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:59.540
Oh, Jamie can't see.

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:01.100
Oh, that looks fun.

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.100
Show it to Jamie.

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.100
She can't see.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.100
Ooh, explodey.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:07.100
Oh, Miklotov's excited about this?

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.300
I love Phantom Vision.

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.140
I think I'm the only person in the world who got the biggest kick out of it.

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:12.140
I still have Phantom Vision.

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:13.140
It's the best.

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:17.260
It was the best launch title and that looks just like it and I can't wait now.

01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:21.060
It really does look like DDR because there's like this kind of a purple line towards the

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:27.940
top of the screen and there's actual looks like the, you know, bursts from the fireworks

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.820
going up instead of you maybe clicking on them or whatever.

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:36.500
They have arrows on them so I think you have to maybe point in the direction of the arrow

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:40.380
or something like kind of like DDR and it'll blow them up in time.

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:41.380
That's my guess.

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:42.380
JV Monn called it.

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.140
JV Monn said, that will make Miklotov happy.

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:48.100
You must talk to him a lot offline or something.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.100
All right.

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:51.100
Before we get to the next story, I just want to point this out.

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:54.980
I wanted to do a quick follow up here on the last story.

01:05:54.980 --> 01:06:00.540
What I thought was interesting is that somebody pointed me to the MySpace for Genkai Rockets

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:05.820
who does Heavenly Star and apparently it is announced on there that there will be five

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:09.180
different remixes of Heavenly Star coming soon and they have a clip.

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.180
I'm assuming this is one of them.

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:31.100
Ah, forget it, that's just some clip from the radio.

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.540
Why did they put that on their MySpace?

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:36.840
Live radio boys and girls, sorry, I didn't know what I was clicking on but they do say

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:42.660
on the MySpace it's written here, five different remixes of Heavenly Star coming soon.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:48.700
Why would they put that clip from a radio show because they want to show that Genkai

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.700
Rockets is awesome?

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:54.620
Why don't they put an MP3 copy of it or something, something that doesn't sound like recorded

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:55.620
off radio?

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:58.260
Do you think we could get Genkai Rockets on the show?

01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:01.300
Do you think they speak English?

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.300
Maybe.

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:03.540
I'm going to fire off an email.

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.020
I'm going to send a message on MySpace.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.020
They sing in English.

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:07.020
We'll see what happens.

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.380
Yeah, I guess that's true.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:16.380
Well anyway, speaking of popular music games such as Fantavision and this Boom Boom Rocket

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:22.040
thing coming up, one very uber popular music game folks have been following is Guitar Hero.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:28.740
We got a lot of Guitar Hero news for you guys tonight and this story is very interesting.

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:33.020
Apparently what's happening now that Activision has acquired Red Octane which happened some

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.780
time ago, apparently what's happening is that the Guitar Hero franchise is now moving over

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:43.500
to the Neversoft branch who makes Tony Hawk's Project 8 and this is confirmed by a screenshot

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:47.740
from Neversoft's website where you see Guitar Hero side by side with Tony Hawk's Project

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:48.740
8.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:54.140
So it does look like now Guitar Hero 3 will be developed by this Neversoft company.

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:58.980
Apparently now this frees up harmonics to work on a rumored sequel to Frequency and

01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:03.500
Amplitude but as we learned about on a previous program, they were going to put one out on

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:07.220
the PSP and it got, I guess, canned.

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:08.580
So I don't know what they're working on now.

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:09.580
Must be top secret.

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:10.580
Who knows?

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:18.620
Well, there is actually something interesting going on though.

01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:25.740
Activision registered trademarks for two new games, Guitar Villain and Drum Villain.

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:30.340
The applications are stating that they're both the same thing, computer game software,

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:39.020
downloadable software for use in connection with computer games, entertainment services.

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:45.660
It seems to me that I think that they're really going to be expanding the franchise.

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:50.620
And both of those applications also said that they'd be using toy guitars for video games,

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:56.220
toys designed to be used for computer games or video games.

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.540
The drum one sounds interesting.

01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:03.620
I'm thinking sort of like what Session Mode was for Drum Mania but also we need to keep

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:12.900
in mind in April last year Red Octane placed applications to trademark Drum Hero and Keyboard

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:13.900
Hero.

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:14.900
So...

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:17.140
I haven't seen anything from those yet.

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.980
No, but it could be...

01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:26.340
But it is interesting that Konami, who did the Bimani series, had a Guitar Freaks, Drum

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:28.020
Mania, and Keyboard Mania.

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.740
So it's almost kind of mirror image.

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.740
That's all right.

01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:38.180
They'll win their awards for Drum Hero and Keyboard Hero and Band Hero and whatever else.

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.180
It's so innovative.

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.180
I've never seen that before.

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:41.180
Ever.

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.180
You know what?

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:46.620
Konami abandoned Keyboard Mania, therefore I am all about bringing on the Keyboard Hero.

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:47.620
That's fine.

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:48.620
That's fine.

01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:49.620
It's fine.

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:50.620
That's optional.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:57.980
If they can put jump in Keyboard Hero, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, tell me not everyone would want to play that.

01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:58.980
Van Halen.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:09:59.980
Session Van Halen.

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:00.980
That would be awesome.

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:01.980
Hello?

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:02.980
All right.

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:03.980
Sorry.

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.420
What the hell would they do with Guitar Villains anyway?

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:08.060
Were there any Guitar Villains?

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.800
Maybe be like Death Metal Edition.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.100
Whatever.

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:14.140
I don't know.

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:19.720
I just hope they don't really come out and try to say it's original.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:24.760
But what's good about music games though, the sales have been up about 80% probably

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:29.900
due to the fact of Guitar Hero 2 coming out since it was one of the top selling games

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:32.140
in December.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:37.100
Not a huge surprise, but a lot of people are starting to actually look at music games as

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:46.060
possibly a way to get their music heard, including some quotes from former Jane's Addiction

01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:51.020
and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Dave Navarro, to be featured in a video game is probably

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:57.700
the greatest way to reach a large audience right now.

01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:02.380
I'm not really surprised with good games like Guitar Hero 2 coming out, they're getting

01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:07.700
a lot more attention than say DDR, because DDR right now, not really that much innovation

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:08.700
going on.

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:15.620
I will say as much as I love and adore Konami for bringing over Beatmania and DDR, I think

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:19.180
this kind of proves they didn't put enough faith in it in the beginning.

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:23.340
Now that the games have taken off, other people are getting the credit for it in a way.

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:28.720
Obviously the guitar game has been reinvented since then, but I think Konami might be kicking

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.420
themselves a little bit for not taking a bigger risk and bringing more of those games over

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.420
here a few years ago.

01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:37.620
You know, I'm really surprised that with Guitar Hero's success that they haven't jumped to

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:39.540
try to bring drum here.

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:45.300
Give it time, you never know what might happen.

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.300
We will see I guess.

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:50.540
Yeah, supposedly they're having a big press conference pretty soon, Konami, and apparently

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:53.340
we get to go, so we'll have all the latest for you.

01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:54.340
Apparently.

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.340
Hopefully.

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:56.700
Hopefully we don't get turned down.

01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:02.180
So we'll have all the latest for you guys here on this program when that happens, which

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.840
is in a couple weeks.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:08.380
Talking now about the Wii a little bit, because you know one reason that people play dance

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:13.420
games is to lose weight, and one thing that has people excited about the Wii is it's got

01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:17.500
you up and moving around, so can you really lose weight playing the Wii?

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.420
And you know my kind of reaction when I saw it was like, well not a lot, you're not doing

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:21.420
that much motion.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:25.660
You're not supposed to do these grand huge motions, you're only supposed to do little

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:28.220
motions with your hand and all that stuff.

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:34.940
This website did this Wii Sports experiment, and apparently what they've done here is that

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:39.420
they did a 30 day trial of playing the game.

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:45.260
They ran, I think they played for 30 days for 30 minutes, and the dude lost like 10

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.260
pounds.

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.260
Without changing any diet or anything.

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:48.260
No, I'm sorry, it was six weeks.

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:52.940
He didn't change any diet or nothing, and in 30 minutes of Wii Sports a day, he lost

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:54.460
10 pounds.

01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:57.980
I would say that's just probably a result of being more active in general, just kind

01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:02.400
of getting the body moving and waking up the muscles and things, probably a little bit.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.540
That's probably it, I mean it's just an increase in activity.

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:09.660
If anything I would consider a low impact aerobic.

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:12.580
Yeah, it's better than nothing.

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:15.260
So you know, cool on that.

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:20.480
And that's probably something I need to go on because I've gained a little weight lately

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:23.380
and I need to lose it, so maybe I'll go on the Wii diet as well.

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:26.860
Because you know, WarioWare has kind of a mode in it that is encouraging the whole weight

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:27.860
loss thing.

01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:33.640
They have a mode that is nothing but games that require big movements.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.540
So it's supposed to be a game that really gets you moving around, and I just need to

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.540
play more DDR.

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:38.540
You're just going to go to the gym.

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:41.860
And I do need to just go to the gym, but you know my thing with gyms.

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:42.860
Gyms are weird places.

01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:44.660
You can come with me and Extra for on Tuesday.

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.660
I'll think about it.

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:47.860
We'll talk off air.

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:50.360
Maybe we'll have a play date, we'll see.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:54.620
Only if we get to, never mind.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:56.100
If we get to go out for ice cream afterwards.

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.460
Okay, let's get ice cream after the gym.

01:13:58.460 --> 01:13:59.460
That works for me.

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.180
That's the kind of reward I need.

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:06.060
All right, anyway, one reward we like to give our listeners is reading the stuff they have

01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:08.120
to write to us on air.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.860
And tonight we have our lovely mailbag segment.

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:14.980
DarkSakura reads the emails that you send to her at mailbag.orangelaungerator.com live

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:16.260
here on the air.

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:18.700
And I believe we probably have an Uber mailbag segment tonight, don't we?

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.700
We probably have a lot.

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:20.700
Decent.

01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:23.540
Once I got rid of the spam, we had a few.

01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:24.540
All right.

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:26.740
Well, let's get to some emails, because I know we probably missed a few while we were

01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:29.580
out and I want to hear what the folks had to say.

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:33.180
So DarkSakura, who emailed us?

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:35.300
First email of the night was from Rini.

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:36.300
Salutations.

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:39.020
I love when an email starts with salutations.

01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:40.020
That's just awesome.

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:44.060
Okay, listen to your last two podcasts of 2006 and we'd like to respond to some items

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:45.060
of interest.

01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:50.660
On your Christmas Eve episode, someone asked why iTunes keeps inexplicably stopping downloads.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:55.060
As much as it pisses me off as well, the only remedy I can offer to iTunes users when you're

01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:59.780
downloading a podcast, make sure that not only is iTunes in the front most or active

01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:05.180
application, but that you keep iTunes in its downloads feature up front as well.

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:09.180
You do this by starting a download in iTunes, choosing downloads on the sidebar to the left

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.660
of the iTunes window.

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:11.660
Okay.

01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:15.580
And since iTunes is already being pissy enough as it is, if you end up with an incomplete

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:19.820
podcast, delete the incomplete file, go on to the podcast section of iTunes and click

01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:24.500
on the Orange Dodge Radio item, the one with the gray iTunes window, click unsubscribe

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:25.860
and then click subscribe.

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:30.100
After you've recovered from doing all that, iTunes will have refreshed the list of all

01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:33.500
shows from the feed and immediately start downloading the latest show automatically.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.220
You know what's also great about that?

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:39.580
The more people that click subscribe, the higher our ranking goes on iTunes.

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:43.380
You're also inadvertently helping the station out, so I love this tactic.

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:45.700
Kudos to Renee.

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:49.540
Regarding your end of the year show, I would like to say that Scott Rubin was quite pissed

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:51.220
that he wasn't invited.

01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.220
Rebuttal?

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:56.020
He would have been a great guest.

01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:03.020
You know, Scott, I left the message on Scott's Xbox Live friends list and he befriended me,

01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.020
so his loss.

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:07.460
No, I'm just kidding.

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:12.340
The reason we picked the people we did is we wanted to get a mix of people that we have

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:18.180
on the show a lot like Bobby and people we hadn't had on the show before but respected

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:23.860
like VGO and Gamertag Radio and those other things.

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:28.360
Scott knows he's welcome on the show any time he wants, so Scott, if you're still feeling

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.700
butthurt about not being on the show, send us an email, we'd love to have you on any

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:32.700
time.

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:37.060
Lastly, I don't believe it was reported on OLR, but the classic CD-ROM trivia game You

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:41.660
Don't Know Jack semi-returns in web form at YouDon'tKnowJack.com.

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:45.380
Currently questions only come in the form of Dis or Dat minigames.

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:50.140
The best parts are that a new Dis or Dat is available daily holidays, too, and one of

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:56.620
the original hosts, I mean, Cookie, is present.

01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:00.700
Curiously, the site is also in beta form.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:03.220
Have a happy new year and keep on going, Reenie.

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:07.060
Uh, yeah, I looked at the You Don't Know Jack's website and played some of the Dis or Dat.

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:09.500
Dude, it's free and it's You Don't Know Jack.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.500
Hello?

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.420
Why aren't you playing?

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:13.420
Go take a look.

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:14.420
It's awesome.

01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:21.260
Um, anyway, uh, moving forward, um, we have one from AZHP.

01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:26.660
Hey, guys, you, um, all were talking about Ikaruga, Radiant Silver Gun, and the possibility

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:29.620
of RS2 on 360.

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:33.260
Just having gotten Ikaruga, um, as a Christmas present for my girlfriend, I wanted to know

01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:37.540
what other games has Treasure made, especially games that were on systems in the realm of

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.060
virtual console games.

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:43.980
I have my Wii and I'm an absolute, uh, VC game whore.

01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:48.660
Not because I played the games in my youth, I'm 18 and in college, but because my paltry

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:53.100
$4 a week allowance didn't allow me to buy many $70 games in my youth.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:58.060
That being said, uh, virtual console is a haven for, uh, shrimp fans, as I have Gunstar

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:02.940
Heroes, Superstar Soldiers, Soldier Blade, and R-Type and Love Them All, and I'm eagerly,

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:07.740
um, anticipating downloading Gradius as soon as I load up more points.

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:11.500
So basically, what Treasure games are there that could possibly make their way to virtual

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.500
console?

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:15.740
Eagerly waiting an answer, sincerely AZHP.

01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:23.540
And I actually emailed back with, um, a list, and, um, give me a second and I will definitely

01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:25.980
pull up the list that I did.

01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:30.500
Um, okay, here are the list of games that Treasure has made.

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:36.700
Um, for Arcados, Ikaruga, Radiant Silver Gun, Dreamcastles, Bongayo, Ikaruga, Game Boy Advance

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:41.580
was Advance Guardian Heroes, Astro Boy Omega Factor, Gunstar Super Heroes, Hajimino Ippo

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:45.840
the Fighting, Tiny Toon Adventures, Buster's Bad Dream, I just totally don't see that coming

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.540
out on virtual console.

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:51.820
Game Boy Color was Tiny Toon Adventures, Dizzy's Candy Quest, Game Gear was Dynamite Headdy,

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:57.060
Gunstar Heroes, GameCube was Dragon Drive, D Master Shot, Ikaruga, Wario World, Genesis,

01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:01.340
Alien Soldier, Dynamite Headdy, Gunstar Heroes, Light Crusader, McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure,

01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:07.580
which I totally don't see coming on virtual console, and Yu Yu Hakusho, Makio, Toitsusen,

01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.500
sorry, um, and then I.Q.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:14.180
Sin and Punishment, Successor to the Earth, Master System had Dynamite Headdy, um, Nintendo

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:18.780
64 was Baccarat, this is just a bunch that came out, basically Mission Makers, Bongayo,

01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:25.120
we had some Bleach games, um, Rakugaki Showtime, Silhouette Mirage, um, basically the games

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:33.260
that I see coming out, um, I think that if they start expanding past, um, the 16-bit

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:37.240
era, which I kind of hope that they do, we might start seeing some of the Saturn 2D ones

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.820
out, I would love to see Radiant Silver Gun and Guardian Heroes and Silhouette Mirage

01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:41.820
coming out.

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:52.780
The Saturn games on virtual console, huh, you really think we get Saturn games on virtual

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:55.780
console?

01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:59.260
But I don't see why we wouldn't get some of the, the, the sprite-based ones.

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:03.540
Maybe on, I'm gonna say it here and now, I bet you anything in the next three years Nintendo

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:06.700
announces a Wii HD, maybe on the Wii HD.

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:10.980
But I totally see us getting, um, like, something like Mischief Makers, um.

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:17.460
I totally see, um, you know, Dynamite Heady, a bunch of the other ones coming out, I mean,

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:22.620
I don't really see why not, if it's not, if it's not just for size, I think that it could

01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:24.660
definitely, um, handle it.

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:29.420
Uh, GS68 makes a good point, soundtracks will raise the file size, because if it uses Red

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:32.440
Book Audio, then that's- Why would it use Red Book Audio?

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.440
Did they?

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:34.440
I don't know.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.440
Didn't some Saturn games use it?

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:40.540
Only some did, and then they started moving in toward, um, the other, eh, I can't remember

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:41.540
off the top of my head.

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:42.540
Okay.

01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:46.700
Some games, I mean, some games you can fully put in and just listen to, but they started

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:49.860
moving away from that toward- Like, DDR Sekimex, I remember, was just randomly

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:53.020
some game I'm thinking of off the top of my head, like, of the PlayStation DDR game?

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:54.020
The first DDR, yeah.

01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:58.140
Yeah, you could, you could put it in a regular CD player and, and hear the songs, the soundtrack.

01:20:58.140 --> 01:20:59.140
Yeah.

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:03.880
Um, a, a lot more games, uh, started moving past that, though, for, for compression.

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:09.100
You know, I think that once, if they were able to get some sort of, you know, increased,

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:14.220
you know, storage capability for the Wii, I think we could totally start seeing, um,

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:18.860
other, uh, you know, later generation system games.

01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:19.860
I don't see why not.

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:21.220
I think they could fully handle it.

01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:22.860
Well, we'll see.

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:24.700
But- Not this year.

01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:29.100
I'm just glad to see that other people like Treasure, because I love Treasure.

01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:36.100
Um, also, um, next email, we have one coming from, um, Nike.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.780
Hey, OLR, I'm here again.

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:41.220
Not quite a lot to say, but I'll try to keep it short.

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:42.660
Hey, what's an MMO?

01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:44.860
Is it like a World of Warcraft style game?

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:48.460
MMO is, uh, um, massively multiplayer online.

01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:52.820
Um, you mean MMORPG, massively multiplayer online roleplay game.

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:56.220
MMO is, uh, massively multiplayer online.

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:59.220
Which basically means you're playing with hundreds of people or thousands of people

01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:01.940
at once instead of just two or three, all online.

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:02.940
You're all in, like, a world.

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:05.020
They're usually world type games.

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:10.740
Um, looking on the HMVUK website, they're saying they're selling Excite Truck for pre-order

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:12.460
for February for £50.

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.460
It's nearly $100 a disc.

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:15.900
And Case and Some Paper.

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:16.900
What a rip-off.

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:17.900
Um, actually, no, it's really fun.

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:21.140
Um- Yeah, but I- I wouldn't pay $100 for it.

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:22.140
Sorry.

01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:23.820
Uh, see, what kind of music do you lot like?

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:26.980
Um, Jamie mentioned ASH, which is number one of my favorites.

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:31.700
Rob also mentioned the music from Elite Beat Agents, which has, uh, stuff like, uh, Sum

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:32.700
41.

01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:35.500
Um, me, my favorite bands are Gorillaz and Pain.

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:39.700
Oh, it's like actual bands or video game music?

01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:40.700
I'm just picking music.

01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:45.200
Because, like, when it comes to video game music, like, I love all the stuff that Mizuguchi

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.200
is a part of.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.780
Like, you know, Space Channel 5 and- and Luminous and all that stuff is awesome.

01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:52.460
Um, and of course, Nobui Matsu.

01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:55.580
Uh, when it comes to real music, which I-

01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:57.580
Rob listens to trancy stuff.

01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:58.580
Eh, sometimes.

01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:00.140
It just depends on what I'm in the mood for.

01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:01.140
Um- And shoes.

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:04.260
What if- what if I've been listening to a lot lately?

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:05.260
I don't even know.

01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:07.340
Um- What's that, uh, Icelandic-

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:08.340
What, Bjork?

01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:09.340
No.

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:10.340
Uh, Roiksop.

01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:11.340
I like them.

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.340
Yeah.

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:13.340
They're cool.

01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:14.340
They're cool.

01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.340
I don't like them.

01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:16.340
I like Bjork, too, though.

01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:17.340
And I also like- I also like Death Metal.

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:18.340
I do.

01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:19.340
I know you do.

01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:20.340
Um- Yeah, I like Guar.

01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:23.980
Actually, I've been listening to- really weirdly, I've been listening to a lot of Morrissey

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:24.980
lately.

01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:29.020
Mainly, you know, because Morrissey was our emo when we didn't have emo.

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:30.020
I love synth pop.

01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:31.020
That's not my big thing.

01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:34.820
Ever since DDR Ultramix 2 really got me into synth pop, like Echo Image and all that crap,

01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:35.820
I love it.

01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:36.820
Can't get enough of it.

01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:40.300
Um, Dee, you don't have the Nintendo Point Store in the US, do you?

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.580
Um, are they still working on that?

01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:43.580
I haven't looked.

01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:44.580
A what?

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:46.140
Nintendo Point Store.

01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:48.900
No, we don't have that in the US.

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:50.060
The channel is there.

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:54.060
No, the Point Store, what they're talking about, it's basically kind of like what they

01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:57.260
have for the Nintendo Club, I think, in Japan, where you-

01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:58.260
Oh, yeah.

01:23:58.260 --> 01:23:59.260
Oh, no.

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:00.260
Buy titles and you earn points or stars.

01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:01.260
No.

01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:02.260
We're all pissed we don't have it.

01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:03.260
Yeah.

01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:04.260
No, we don't have it.

01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:09.500
Um, also, why, uh, why doesn't Nintendo partner with voice over IP like Skype?

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:12.260
The Wiimote has a speaker plus mic, um, actually it just has a speaker.

01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:15.460
Why doesn't Nintendo actually have some online games for the Wii yet?

01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:17.540
I mean, it's because they're-

01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:21.180
For some reason, they feel they need to roll it out slowly, so whatever.

01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:22.180
It's their strategy.

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:25.580
Somehow they feel they're ahead in innovation in some parts and they're really behind in

01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:27.100
other parts, so whatever.

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:33.060
Um, some of these questions I think we've actually already answered, um, and so skipping

01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:39.180
through I'm gonna, um, say what does OLR team think of renting games, um, good way to test

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:40.180
them out?

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:42.620
It's something I should be doing that I'm not, honestly.

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:47.820
I should be doing, using that Gamefly or comparable type service and I'm not.

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.380
I really need to look into that.

01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:52.780
Yeah, maybe I would have avoided buying Red Steel.

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:53.780
This is an interesting question.

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:56.140
How do you go about getting a job in the game industry?

01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:59.740
I was wondering as I had many career paths open for me at the moment, including being

01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:00.740
a doctor.

01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:03.020
Um, sometimes you just chance into it.

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:07.900
I have a friend who is a math major who now is a programmer for a company in the Bay Area.

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:09.860
Well, Shane, you kind of work in the game industry.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:11.260
How did you get your job?

01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:12.260
Accident.

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:13.260
Really?

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:16.660
I was just, whoops, now I work at a game company.

01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:21.300
Yeah, it just depends on people you know or if you look at Craigslist.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:26.460
Most of the game companies post entry level positions there all the time.

01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:29.140
But you really have to be in an area where there's game companies.

01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.140
Yes.

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.140
I mean if you live...

01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:33.140
Or your skill needs to be high in demand.

01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:38.020
I mean if you live in Wichita, Kansas, no offense Shane, that's where you used to live.

01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:40.340
If you live there, then you're probably not going to find a whole lot of...

01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.180
That's how I got my job, so...

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:46.300
Well, but now you're here in California, aren't you?

01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:49.820
You know, it's best if you live where, Bay Area, LA?

01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:54.940
Wherever the major game companies are, you've got like Washington, the Redmond area, and

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:57.780
then you've got the Bay Area, and then you've got LA.

01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:02.420
That's where you want to go for the major ones.

01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:06.740
The reality is though, if you're sitting there thinking, I've got a great idea for a video

01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:07.740
game...

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:08.740
Wisconsin.

01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.460
Oh, they have the one company there.

01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:16.180
I'm just saying, because I was thinking about Mexico.

01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:18.940
A lot of major metros have at least one.

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:24.400
Keep in mind that the industry, though, is very, very diverse.

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:27.100
You can be an artist, get in as a designer.

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:28.420
You can be a writer.

01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:35.040
I was asked if I was interested in writing game manuals, and part of why I was going

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.980
to school was to actually do manuals.

01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:37.980
Why'd you turn that down?

01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:39.180
I didn't turn it down.

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.660
I called on it and didn't hear anything.

01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:45.420
And that was actually for a writing strategy guide, so I don't really want to...

01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:46.900
I'm in school to do what I want to do.

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:48.580
I'm going to be a massage therapist.

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:54.740
I could freakin' be an independent contractor for a video game company, giving massages

01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:56.460
during people's lunch.

01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:57.460
Pac Bell does that.

01:26:57.460 --> 01:26:58.460
Oh, yeah.

01:26:58.460 --> 01:26:59.460
A lot of major companies do.

01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:00.460
Our company does too.

01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:04.980
So I could work in the video game industry as a massage therapist.

01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:06.540
It's possible.

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:09.140
I would love to have that be your catch on this show.

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:12.660
She works in the game therapy, giving massages and happy endings.

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.140
I don't give happy endings.

01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:18.700
You know what's funny, though, we learned that in San Francisco, in the county, for

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.800
you to be a massage therapist there, you have to...

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.900
It's considered adult entertainment, so you're lumped in the same category as prostitutes.

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:25.900
Hot.

01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:26.900
I know.

01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:29.300
I hate it.

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:30.300
The last question.

01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:33.420
I doubt that PS3 will sell many due to its high prices in the UK.

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:35.100
It's going to be a lot over here.

01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:38.500
We get bummed at everything in gaming.

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:41.040
Most young gamers already have a 360 or at least a Wii.

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:45.180
Just thinking about how much market it will really have apart from now.

01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.180
Wow.

01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:47.180
It's Sony's stupid fanboy impression.

01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:52.420
I must say the graphics do look good, no better than 360, though, and played one with Ridge

01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:53.420
Racer.

01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:54.560
But you played Ridge Racer.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.560
That's not going to...

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:56.560
Play Resistance, honestly.

01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:01.580
I think that that one really plays up the system's capabilities well.

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:04.700
So apart from that, though, yeah, the rest of it's crap.

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:05.700
Okay.

01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:07.260
I failed to keep it short, but oh well.

01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:10.180
This week has been busy going to college next week, so hope that goes well.

01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:11.180
Until next time, necky.

01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:12.180
Well, thanks for the email.

01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:13.180
That was a lot of questions.

01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:14.180
I was like...

01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:15.180
Yeah, and I actually skipped...

01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:16.180
20 questions from our UK fan.

01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:17.180
Sorry.

01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:20.420
He got to L, but one repeated.

01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:21.420
It's all good.

01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:22.420
It's all good.

01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:23.420
Okay.

01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:24.420
We have two more emails to go.

01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:25.420
All right.

01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:31.100
This one is from one of our listeners in Belgium, Fabrice.

01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:34.100
You know one good thing I liked that All Games had at their little thing?

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:37.180
They had a big map of the world, and every time they got a collar from somewhere, they'd

01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:38.180
put a pin in the map.

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:39.180
We should totally freaking do that.

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.180
I think we totally need to steal that idea.

01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:42.180
For our email.

01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:43.180
I'm thinking about...

01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:44.180
Well, we could do both.

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:45.180
We do emails on collars.

01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:46.180
We have blue pins for emails, red pins for collars, something.

01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:49.020
We have blue pins for emails, red pins for call.

01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:50.020
Exactly.

01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:53.340
I'm thinking we might steal that idea, because when I hear that we were getting collars from

01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.580
Argentina and mail from Belgium, that's so cool.

01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:56.580
I did think it was funny.

01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:00.820
After a while, you just started handing me the pins, because I took my geography class

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:03.980
like a year ago, so I still remember this crap.

01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:08.980
To continue on with the email, hi, O-L-R. First of all, congratulations on your radio

01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:09.980
show.

01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:13.500
Sadly, I've only discovered O-L-R since episode 180 or something since then.

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.140
I've been listening every week.

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:18.820
Also, I can't listen to your live show, because I live in Belgium.

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:19.820
That's okay.

01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.820
We forgive you.

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:23.460
I wonder what you at O-L-R think of the current state of Sega.

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:27.140
The last years, they've done nothing but release crappy game after crappy game.

01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:32.420
As soon as they use the EA technique, release as much games as you can, and you'll earn

01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:33.420
money easily.

01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:36.820
Sonic the Hedgehog was somewhat the epitaph for what they are doing.

01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:42.060
They only had some good titles, but only the short period after the Dreamcast was dead,

01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:43.620
like Panzer Dragoon, Orta, etc.

01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:48.260
I'm a Sega fanboy, but it's even hard for me to get excited about a new Sega title.

01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:53.620
All I'm looking forward to is Sega Rally Revo and Virtua Tennis 3.

01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:54.620
What is wrong with them?

01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:56.940
Do they miss their own console?

01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:57.940
Did they go with the times?

01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:59.460
Are they lacking the talent?

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:03.980
Will the Dreamcast days ever return when they made games like Virtua Tennis, Crazy Taxi,

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:06.980
Shenmue, Rez, etc.

01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:13.180
They're all highly playable, enjoyable, and for everyone, not only the hardcore gamer.

01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:16.140
Sega wasn't afraid to experiment and come up with some crazy ideas.

01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:18.740
Anyways, I wonder what your thoughts on Sega are these days.

01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:21.020
Keep up the good work, and Dark Sakura Disneyland rules.

01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:23.020
I love you.

01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:28.620
I don't know, this is a tough question.

01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:31.660
I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that Sega was making systems for so long and

01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:32.820
now they only make games.

01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:36.620
So there has to be some downsizing that comes with that and some of your biggest talents

01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:37.620
jump ship.

01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:40.720
They were just in a funk.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:46.340
I think that when you are making games for your system, you know how to make it work

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.340
on your system.

01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:54.140
I think that is a lot of strength that when it's your product and you have all the in-house

01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:57.600
stuff available to you, you know how to make the most of it.

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:01.480
I really think that that might be hurting them with some of the newer titles, but also

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:09.340
I think that honestly, I hate to say it, but Sega is going to need to get back on the track

01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:12.100
and find out what made them great to begin with.

01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:16.020
Instead of doing all the flashy, showy stuff, they need to get back to the heart.

01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:19.180
I think that they need to take a page from Nintendo.

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:22.380
The Phantasy Star universe wasn't bad, in my opinion.

01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:23.620
It wasn't great.

01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:25.620
Well, not really average games to me.

01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:29.580
Full auto was awesome, and Chrome House was slow.

01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.620
Most people didn't like full auto or full auto 2.

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:34.380
You're kind of in your own little bubble there.

01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:35.380
I enjoyed it.

01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:36.380
I enjoyed full auto.

01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:37.980
I did end up selling it back, but I enjoyed it.

01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:44.300
Full auto 2 is kind of, eh, but I mean, hell, they've got a ton of cool games coming out

01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:45.300
pretty soon.

01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:49.900
Sonic and the Secret Rings, which should be pretty cool, as long as the control is good

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:50.900
on it.

01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:56.080
Virtua Fighter 5, I mean, that's going to be a pretty solid fighting game for the PS3.

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:58.700
Sega Rally Revo.

01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:03.660
Armored Core 4, the game that I've been waiting for for the longest time.

01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:08.460
I bought Chrome Hounds thinking, hey, maybe it's Armored Core 4, but no, it's Armored

01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:13.180
Core 4 with mono or something like that.

01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:14.660
We need Knights on Wii.

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:16.860
I want to say some interesting comments from chat.

01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:22.100
DDRDollarBill says, Sega needs to make more games that are unique.

01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:26.660
Bandit says, first Sega starts making consoles, then drop that and just got into games.

01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:28.460
Sony, you're next.

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.060
The bold statement there.

01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:33.340
SSJ100Matt has an idea how Sega can get back to their roots.

01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:35.180
Two words, blast processing.

01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:39.380
Well, they're remaking some of their classic franchises like Alien and Syndrome.

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:42.580
That looks pretty good for the Wii and like PSP and stuff.

01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:45.780
Crazy Taxi, they have some game coming, you know, called Crush.

01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:46.780
I know.

01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:48.780
I know that we'll save Sega.

01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:49.780
Sega to Sanchiro.

01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:54.700
Do you know the last Sega game I played that was absolutely badass and underrated in every

01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:58.900
way and that people should have respected more was F-Zero.

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:02.540
Because remember that was the Sega, Nintendo, and Namco in the arcades partnership.

01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:03.540
That game was badass.

01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:05.420
That's still one of my favorite racing games ever.

01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:06.820
I don't know why they don't remake that.

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:07.820
They need a new one.

01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:10.180
Sega needs to start doing games exclusively for Nintendo.

01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:14.180
Or you know what, I hate to say it, but since Nintendo doesn't have the oomph behind it,

01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:16.820
you know, with the Wii, the Wii doesn't have that pretty stuff.

01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:21.040
I'm sure there will be inevitably an F-Zero game on the Wii that will be pretty awesome,

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:26.100
but seriously, like if Sega made a racer kind of like that, I'm not talking full auto, on

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:28.100
the 360, ooh, that'll be hot.

01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:29.100
That'll be hot.

01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:31.980
You know what actually franchise, I wouldn't mind seeing coming out on the next system.

01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:32.980
Or PS3.

01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:37.500
There was a, I believe it was a Sega, it was Burning Rangers.

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:44.360
In fact, I know it was because the music was on freaking Samba de Amigo, but we need Burning

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:46.000
Rangers to come back.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.140
To clarify for chat, because they're saying F-Zero was done by Sega, not the original

01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:50.140
obviously.

01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:59.700
But the GameCube version and arcade, GX and AX, AX was Namco, Sega, Nintendo, the Triforce,

01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:02.900
and then GX was just Sega and Nintendo.

01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:05.500
And I'll tell you what, booting that game for the first time and seeing both those logos

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:09.500
on the screen at the same time, that was a weird feeling for me, the 80s gamer.

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:10.500
I'm sorry.

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.300
Did it make you feel happy in the pants?

01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:15.660
No, it made me feel weird.

01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:18.940
I'm looking at this going, but Sega does what Nintendo don't.

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:22.420
I don't, this is beyond comprehension.

01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:23.420
Another email?

01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:24.420
That actually was the last of our emails.

01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:25.420
Oh, it was nice.

01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:26.420
Another window opened.

01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:27.420
Okay.

01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:28.420
So yeah, send us more.

01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:29.420
Send us more.

01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:30.420
We like it.

01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:31.420
Mailbagorangeloungeradio.com.

01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:35.420
I'm sure after some of our stories tonight, we'll get plenty of emails.

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.980
Battletoads versus Double Dragon.

01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:37.980
Hell yeah.

01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:38.980
We need a new one of that.

01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:40.260
Did Sega do that?

01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:41.260
It was on Genesis.

01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:45.460
Wasn't Tecmo responsible for both those franchises?

01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:46.460
I can't remember.

01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:50.140
Yeah, the Streets of Rage was Burning Knuckle.

01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:51.140
Acclaim.

01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:52.140
Battletoads is rare?

01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:56.220
No, Battletoads was Acclaim, I want to say.

01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:57.220
I'll remember.

01:34:57.220 --> 01:35:00.380
Making me go to Wikipedia, god damn it.

01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:03.580
So anyways, we've got some interesting stuff about Nintendo, actually.

01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:09.100
Mad Catz is doing a third-party Wii-mote that looks like a penis.

01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:11.660
So way to go, Mad Catz.

01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:16.620
You've taken the Wii and made it look like a sex toy.

01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:17.620
Excellent.

01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:21.980
Yeah, it's supposed to be more ergonomic looking, but it looks like a penis.

01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:25.140
I'm sorry.

01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:28.900
Be sure to pick up your third-party penis by Mad Catz.

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:29.900
Coming soon.

01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:30.900
Joy.

01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:31.900
Lovely.

01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:35.940
I remember them saying they were going to have the third-party Wii-motes, but it's kind

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:37.780
of interesting to see what some of them look like.

01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:38.780
That looks like a penis.

01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:39.780
No, it doesn't.

01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:42.020
It does so look like a penis.

01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:43.020
Where are the balls?

01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:45.980
Okay, well, just a shaft.

01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:47.980
Let me see.

01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:49.420
It looks like a vibrator.

01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:53.420
That doesn't look like any penis I've ever seen.

01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:54.420
Fine.

01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:57.820
It looks like a sex toy, though.

01:35:57.820 --> 01:36:06.140
With those frickin' homemade programs that you can use your Bluetooth devices for, including

01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:11.220
the Wii vibrator thing, there you go, they've made the complete package for you.

01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:12.220
All right.

01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:17.260
By the way, thank you, Wikipedia, Battletoads was a video game franchise by Tradewest.

01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:22.500
The first game was released by Rare for the NES in 1991.

01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:23.500
There you go.

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:28.180
I remember, I think Tradewest had something to do with Double Dragon, too, if that makes

01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:29.180
sense.

01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:31.740
Yeah, they made the original Double Dragon on the NES.

01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:32.740
There you go.

01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:33.740
Or published it.

01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:34.740
Whatever.

01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:38.580
Anyhow, this is a good time for us to take a break, I think.

01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:40.540
We've been going for a little while here, so we're going to take ourselves a little

01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:44.900
break, and we will come back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:49.420
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:50.420
a week.

01:36:50.420 --> 01:37:05.100
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
