7000	14000	These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	Soon you can earn Xbox achievements on your Nintendo Switch. No really, it's so weird.
18000	23000	And the gaming world turns with years old gaming high score drama taking a big twist this week.
23000	27000	We get into all this and more this week on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	35000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back.
35000	37000	It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	42000	Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, April 15th of 2018.
42000	45000	Don't forget your taxes here in the US, even though you have until the 17th.
45000	49000	But anyway, episode 726 of our show with myself, Rob Roberts.
49000	52000	And by my side as she always is, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
52000	54000	This beverage is amazing.
54000	55000	What are you drinking over there?
55000	56000	It's the peppermint cocoa.
56000	59000	Oh that chocolate truffle thing. I don't even remember where I got it now.
59000	62000	It's delicious and it makes me feel happy to be alive.
62000	65000	Even though they're not paying us, I will give a shout out to Keurig.
65000	68000	Because those machines have changed my life.
68000	73000	Except Keurig can go suck on an egg for that whole DRM with the coffee.
73000	75000	But I think that's kind of in the past now.
75000	77000	I think they figured that they kind of can't win with that.
77000	78000	You know what?
78000	79000	What?
79000	80000	I use a drip.
80000	82000	Not a machine.
82000	85000	I have a cup that I put a filter in.
85000	86000	Yeah, you do old school.
86000	87000	I do old school coffee.
87000	88000	You don't even have a percolator.
88000	89000	I do have a percolator.
89000	90000	You do have a percolator.
90000	95000	I have a Pyrex percolator from 1958.
95000	96000	There you go.
96000	97000	That's good. Yeah.
97000	102000	My granny told me two months before she died, never get rid of it.
102000	104000	And I'm saying good to that.
104000	105000	It will go to my grave.
105000	106000	Good for you.
106000	111000	No, I was at Easter Sunday at my family, my aunt and uncle.
111000	114000	And their coffee percolator is probably from the 50s as well.
114000	116000	And it was one of those, like, I had a moment where I was using it.
116000	119000	I was like, wow, I don't remember the last time I had coffee out of a percolator.
119000	121000	Like, you know, everything now, even at the restaurants,
121000	123000	everything is like that just, you know, flowing through the filter.
123000	125000	You know, just the giant machine.
125000	126000	That's how the work machines work.
126000	129000	That's how Starbucks really does, you know, most of their stuff.
129000	131000	So just like, wow, a percolator.
131000	133000	The only other way that I will get it that is really, really good too.
133000	135000	And it deserves a shout out.
135000	136000	And I know this isn't a coffee podcast.
136000	137000	It's a video game podcast.
137000	138000	But let's be real.
138000	140000	I drink a lot of coffee when I stay up late playing video games.
140000	142000	French press.
142000	143000	I have a couple of French presses.
143000	145000	In fact, if you want my extra, you can have it.
145000	146000	Oh, we have one.
146000	149000	But it's just that there's something so satisfying about the plunger.
149000	150000	It was the French.
150000	152000	Well, I have two things on my list to get from Michael.
152000	154000	Now, keep in mind, I can't have caffeine anymore.
154000	155000	So it's all decaf for me.
155000	156000	Right.
156000	160000	But I want a mocha pot, which is basically like an Italian percolator.
160000	163000	That's metal and has the two sides it uses and a siphon.
163000	166000	Both of them use the same, you know, theory.
166000	169000	A percolator does because it uses vacuum pressure.
169000	171000	It's science, but coffee.
172000	174000	Coffee and science.
174000	175000	What a way to wake up.
175000	177000	That would be a good name of a Facebook page I would like.
177000	179000	It is science, but coffee.
179000	181000	Stimulating for body and mind.
181000	182000	Right.
182000	186000	Say hello to the ever stimulating comments from tech master Loki.
186000	187000	Science.
187000	189000	Stimulating or scintillating.
189000	190000	How are you, Loki?
190000	192000	Little column A, little column B.
192000	194000	How many times have you seen Ready Player One at this point?
194000	195000	Just twice.
195000	196000	Just twice?
196000	199000	No, I can't get out to the theaters every weekend because kids and wife.
199000	200000	It's just like, yeah.
200000	201000	Yeah.
201000	202000	What a life.
202000	203000	What a life.
203000	204000	You're falling behind.
204000	209000	Shane is on, I think, seven viewings of Love, Simon, and we're going with him tonight after
209000	210000	the show.
210000	211000	Late movie tonight.
211000	212000	Is good.
212000	213000	Yeah.
213000	214000	I don't know.
214000	215000	I mean, I totally see it again.
215000	217000	Have you ever seen a movie that many times in the theater?
217000	221000	I saw Independence Day every single day up to Independence Day.
221000	225000	So, like, we actually got to see like, it was like three or four days in a row.
225000	226000	Welcome to Earth.
226000	227000	That movie was classic.
227000	229000	I never bothered to see the sequel.
229000	230000	Tell me the sequel was...
230000	231000	The sequel was terrible.
231000	233000	Don't see the sequel.
233000	236000	In fact, I don't think I watched the sequel, but I've heard it's terrible.
236000	240000	Let me quickly, I want to say hi to the chat room over at live.vog.network.com because
240000	243000	we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right
243000	247000	after Bobby Black Wolf at The Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
247000	250000	Although it is a, it's a little bit of a weird week.
250000	253000	SSG100Matt said classic Rob intro in our chat room.
253000	256000	And yeah, it was, it was my voice in the intro tonight because Jason has the night off.
256000	257000	He's traveling.
257000	259000	Bobby Black Wolf was not here tonight.
259000	262000	He's at a Weird Al concert, which let's be real is a great reason.
262000	265000	I'm going through the same one next month.
265000	266000	Oh yeah.
266000	267000	Cause he's touring.
267000	268000	At the Crest.
268000	269000	Science.
269000	273000	Anyway, uh, let me ask the chatters and you guys here in studio, what is the movie you've
273000	277000	seen the most number of times in the theater like that?
277000	278000	What are you doing?
278000	279000	I don't think about it.
279000	281000	No counting the Rocky Hort picture show.
281000	282000	Well, that's too easy.
282000	283000	That's too easy.
283000	284000	That's too easy.
284000	285000	That's my obvious answer.
285000	289000	I've seen Return of the Jedi a total of eight times in the theater.
289000	294000	Three of them when it first came out because I saw it with various family members and five
294000	296000	times as an adult with the re-release.
296000	297000	Okay.
297000	304000	Um, I've also seen all of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, the original three, four
304000	305000	times in the theater each.
305000	309000	I've seen Bill and Taz Bogus Journey six times in the theater.
309000	311000	Seen Pump Up the volume four times in the theater.
311000	314000	I've seen Tron six times.
314000	321000	Um, I saw, um, uh, the Phantom Menace twice.
321000	325000	Actually, I saw, um, the last one twice already.
325000	326000	You sat through the Phantom Menace twice?
326000	327000	Not the Phantom Menace.
327000	328000	Why am I saying the Phantom Menace?
328000	332000	I meant, um, the last Jedi wakes up from his nap.
332000	333000	Oh, episode seven.
333000	334000	Basically.
334000	335000	Yeah.
335000	340000	But, um, gosh, I've seen, I think I've seen Gremlins.
340000	341000	No, I take that back.
341000	343000	I've seen Ghostbusters 10 times in the theaters.
343000	345000	So I think that is the one I've seen the most.
345000	346000	Wow.
346000	351000	Cause I saw it a few times as a kid and then it went to the cheap movie and I saw it there
351000	358000	and then, um, I've seen it three more times as an adult on Halloween showings.
358000	359000	Let's see.
359000	366000	For me, um, all that comes to mind is other cult movies because I've seen Repo, the genetic
366000	368000	opera, like easily like 20, 25 times.
368000	369000	I don't think that counts too.
369000	370000	If you've done shadow cast.
370000	371000	Yeah, I know.
371000	373000	It's like the shadow, like even I'm like shock treatment.
373000	375000	I've probably seen a good six or seven theater.
375000	376000	Yeah.
376000	377000	Yeah.
377000	381800	But that's also, and it's, it's, it's, I had to see it that many times to finally appreciate
381800	385600	the movie because if you don't know what shock treatment is, it's the quote unquote, it's
385600	389600	not the sequel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but it's like the, what if these characters
389600	391600	were in a different place in a different time type of thing?
391600	395200	It's, it's, it's really high concept, but here's the American horror story of the, it
395200	396200	is, it is.
396200	397960	It's like, okay, that's actually a perfect way to describe it.
397960	401360	It's American horror story, but like the second like chapter first time I saw that
401360	405040	was when Evan was living with Jessica and he made those cookies.
405040	406040	Yes.
406040	407120	Here's the thing about shock treatment though.
407120	412260	It's like a parody of reality television made in 1981.
412260	416040	Like actually the movie would like now in retrospect was actually like really, really
416040	419860	ahead of its time and it has a really good soundtrack, almost like it's a parody of let's
419860	420860	make a deal.
420860	421860	Kinda.
421860	423760	I mean, the audience and everything.
423760	424760	Yeah.
424760	427540	And you get to see Dame Edna, but like not as Dame Edna.
427540	431920	Like Dame Edna as, I don't even remember, Barry Humphries, you see Dame Edna as Barry
431920	433300	Humphries in that movie.
433300	438740	So and Ruby Wax, like all these like, like they're more known like, like obviously Dame
438740	441240	Edna is what Australia, Ruby Wax UK.
441240	444380	So like a lot of people here in the US don't know, although Ruby Wax had a show on Fox
444380	445380	in the nineties.
445380	446380	Do you remember the Ruby Wax show?
446380	447380	I remember the Ruby Wax show.
447380	450220	Anyway, this is really obscured.
450220	451640	I remember the RuPaul show though.
451640	453540	It's going to be one of those nights.
453540	456420	I saw Kung Pao maybe four times in the theaters.
456420	457420	Okay.
457420	458420	There you go.
458420	459420	There you go.
459420	460420	What about Kung Fury?
460420	461420	I saw that one time in the theater.
461420	464620	Oh, I have seen, um, hot fuzz four times in the theater.
464620	465620	The only, okay.
465620	468660	The non cold movies that come to mind, I saw, don't tease me.
468660	470140	Do not tease me.
470140	472660	I saw Titanic three times in the theater.
472660	475780	Do you want to know how I saw Titanic?
475780	476780	How?
476780	477780	On a boat?
477780	479740	I think that's, that's the way to see it.
479740	481660	I wish I had gone down with that boat.
481660	482660	No.
482900	487620	We had a, um, an Emmy's viewing tape bootleg.
487620	488860	Oh, okay.
488860	489860	And that's how I saw it.
489860	490860	What Emmy's?
490860	491860	You mean Oscars?
491860	492860	Oscar, sorry, whatever.
492860	495740	An Oscars, um, uh, pre-release viewing thing.
495740	498780	So it was while it was still in the theater, but we had that and it was the same night
498780	499780	I saw American beauty.
499780	500780	It was weird.
500780	501780	Okay.
501780	504820	So that movie came out when I was in college and I had a lot of lady friends that wanted
504820	508980	to see it repeatedly because that, by the way, to answer Tiger call's question as to
508980	513420	how many times I've seen Howard the Duck as a kid and, um, twice.
513420	517500	That movie, like when we was Titanic, I don't think I've ever sat through the whole thing
517500	521860	because like I remember that was like back in the day via the company I used to work
521860	525180	at the previous company that was like a video distributor or whatever.
525180	529620	My dad actually, he used to deliver to that company even before I ever got there.
529620	530860	I was still in high school.
530860	533620	So he used to get the screeners for movies and stuff.
533620	536140	So that's how he got Titanic to watch it.
536140	537140	Oh my God.
537140	539820	It's like such a soul sucking, boring ass movie.
539820	545220	Like I just like after the first day I'm like, I can't, I cannot do this much cooler.
545220	547620	I saw Tron legacy three times in the theater.
547620	549700	So that is my better answer.
549700	550700	Yeah.
550700	551700	Ties.
551700	553900	Ties a little more into video games, but I do want to read some of the answers in our
553900	556700	chat over at live dot vog network.com.
556700	560340	Dungeon buster says I almost never see a movie twice in the theater unless it's really something
560340	563780	I've enjoyed and someone who hasn't seen it wants to go.
563780	565220	Same with the exception of Tron legacy.
565220	566980	I just wanted to see that a million times.
566980	569420	Um, Oh, can I count that Muppet movie?
569420	570420	How about captain EO?
570420	571420	I've seen captain EO.
571420	572420	Yeah.
572420	573420	Captain EO.
573420	576060	I've seen a bunch of times easily.
576060	577060	Yeah.
577060	578060	I fucking love captain EO.
578060	579060	Okay.
579060	581220	Um, go going back to the real answers in the chat.
581220	584700	Uh, SGL and her mat also says Ghostbusters five times to the theater.
584700	587460	Dungeon buster says, I can't remember how many times I've rewatched Raiders of the Lost
587460	588460	Ark.
588460	589460	Uh, let's see.
589460	590780	But it has to be in a theater.
590780	593580	Act F says the first Avengers are the first guardians of the galaxy.
593580	595980	I think I saw those movies three or four times in the theater.
595980	598380	Uh, active says Shrek as well.
598380	601460	Uh, SJ says, what about guilty pleasure?
601460	602460	Multiple showings.
602460	604300	I saw anger management three times in the theater.
604300	608220	Fifth dream says I saw Terminator two twice on the same day.
608220	609220	That's pretty good.
609220	610220	Okay.
610220	611220	That's pretty good.
611220	612220	All right.
612220	613220	Anyway.
613220	614220	Uh, great.
614220	615220	I love it.
615220	616220	Uh, thank you for the answers over in our chat.
616220	621020	We're talking in a theater, live.vognetwork.com that you have to go in and sit and look at
621020	623460	a screen that's the size of your house.
623460	624460	Yes.
624460	625460	All right.
625460	626460	Yes.
626460	630860	Well, not necessarily like the art house theater in Chico when I lived there for a few years
630860	636220	probably was somebody's house and the screen was probably as big as this television that's
636220	638380	in our living room or in our studio.
638380	647580	I mean, I've also, my, my church had return of the Jedi on a full reel with a projector.
647580	648580	Nice.
648580	649580	When I was a kid.
649580	650580	Was I saw it a bunch that time.
650580	653780	Did they have like the safe for church version or something?
653780	654780	I don't even know.
654780	656220	It's not like that movie was very bad anyway.
656220	657220	Was it?
657220	658220	It wasn't.
658220	659220	I didn't want to leave.
659220	663220	I just know sometimes movies had like the safe for, you know, or the, the G rated cut
663220	664220	or whatever.
664220	665220	You know what I say to that?
665220	672880	Oh God, the show girls VH one edit is great where they draw on all the bras.
672880	673880	That is my favorite.
673880	674880	Yeah.
674880	675880	It's like that.
675880	679620	Was it, um, safe for work porn thing that they have, you know, where they do like the
679620	681420	like Microsoft paint stuff.
681420	682420	All right.
682420	686380	Anyway, look, uh, we talk about video games once in a while here on this show.
686380	687380	Okay.
687380	691220	From movies, I'm going to go to music because for our kickoff topic tonight, I've had a
691220	695220	little bit of Coachella on the brain this weekend because I don't know about you guys,
695220	698380	but my Twitter timeline last night was lit the fuck up.
698380	702060	Just remember the owner of Coachella supports anti LGBT.
702060	703060	I understand.
703060	709420	However, it needs to be said that Beyonce, the queen of pop basically lit the fuck up
709420	711140	out of that event last night.
711140	715940	So shady dealings aside and all that, it's what people are talking about.
715940	720820	And I want to think about video game concerts and video game music and you know, going to
720820	723480	see stuff for video games live.
723480	726340	So I'm kind of asking a couple of questions here tonight.
726340	730660	The first one would be, do you have any good like video game concerts that you've been
730660	731660	to?
731660	732660	Video game related things.
732660	735860	Um, you know, it could be an actual video games concert.
735860	737020	Like, um, let's see.
737020	741060	I remember going with announcer Jason here at OLR.
741060	744660	We went, it was the first E3 I think I ever went to and he was there too.
744660	748580	And we went to go see the final fantasy live concert.
748580	749580	Was it dear?
749580	750580	Yeah.
750580	751580	It was dear friends.
751580	752580	You were there too.
752580	753940	No, Jason and I went one year.
753940	756020	Didn't we go to more friends?
756020	757020	I don't remember.
757020	758020	It's Final Fantasy though.
758020	759020	Did we all go?
759020	760020	Maybe we all did.
760020	761020	I don't know.
761020	762020	I saw video games live.
762020	763340	Is that the universal thing?
763340	764980	No, that was more friends.
764980	766340	Friends was at universal.
766340	770100	That was, and that wasn't as good, but dear friends was the first year at the Walt Disney
770100	775060	Symphony hall that, that we would, I'm positive with that with Jason because I've seen video
775060	776060	games live.
776060	779420	I remember we were sitting right next to Nobui Matsu and we had no idea.
779420	781500	We're like, why is this seat like all taped up and everything?
781500	783820	And they're like, Oh, Nobui Matsu comes in the theater and sits right next to us.
783820	786460	And I was like, okay, that's a thing that just happened.
786460	789100	Um, but anyway, uh, that was, that was great.
789100	790180	Live symphony.
790180	793060	And uh, my other like symphony story would be video games live.
793140	798340	Uh, when I saw that, when it came through Oakland, uh, that was actually the first time
798340	800660	I ever met Alan in person.
800660	804340	So Alan and I were friends online on live journal for years, but we, that was the first
804340	809420	time we met in person and it was captain spike from Game Buoy who actually was like, Oh,
809420	810580	don't you guys like know each other online?
810580	812900	Have you ever met in person, Rob, Alan, Alan Rob.
812900	814740	So, uh, and that was that.
814740	816900	So yeah, that was a video game related thing.
816900	820980	I would say another one that's, that's kind of video game related is when I was fortunate
820980	826500	enough to see Utada Hikaru at the Fillmore in San Francisco, which is a pretty small
826500	827500	venue.
827500	831500	I mean, I'm pretty sure Utada Hikaru sells out much bigger venues in Japan, but getting
831500	836180	to see her in that smaller venue in, um, which, you know, kingdom hearts, she did.
836180	839500	If I do, if I do recall correctly, she did play simple and clean.
839500	842400	So, um, I can say that as an answer.
842400	843960	That was a great concert too.
843960	846940	And I think again, I think captain spike is who I went to that with.
846940	849220	So it's kind of funny how that all goes together.
849220	850220	What about you guys?
850300	852300	What like good video game concerts have you seen?
852300	853300	I opened this up to chat as well.
853300	861860	Got to see Mari Ijima, who was, uh, uh, Min May's voice actor in, uh, Macross back in
861860	862860	the day.
862860	864300	I've got to see, um, some of her concerts.
864300	870100	I've seen a few, um, live shows at conventions, you know, just that.
870100	871100	That's about it.
871100	872100	Okay.
872100	874180	Well, I saw more friends.
874180	875820	That was it.
875820	878840	More friends wasn't nearly as good as dear friend, like the acoustics in that place was
879040	880040	wasn't great.
880040	883760	So it's kind of, I think they, they never did that concert again, but the final fantasy
883760	886680	stuff kind of like tours, it comes through different towns every now and again.
886680	887680	So it's pretty fun.
887680	894960	Uh, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, um, let's see, uh, I'm looking at some comments
894960	895960	here.
895960	898860	Some people talking about Coachella and what Jamie had said earlier, uh, as 200, Matt says,
898860	903800	mag fest, the live performance of the journey game that they played an orchestra while someone
903800	904800	played the game.
904800	905800	That was cool.
905800	906800	Yes.
906800	907800	I was there for that too.
907800	908800	That was one of the years I went, Matt.
909760	912560	It was, uh, Austin Wintory was actually there directing it and people were playing the game.
912560	913560	That was rad.
913560	914800	I agree with you on that.
914800	916120	Thank you for reminding me of that.
916120	920680	Uh, fifth dream says I went to a live official Pokemon event one year and it had a live stage
920680	926240	show with a game show kids signing a kids singing the Johto theme song and people dressed
926240	928480	like may and some Pokemon running around.
928480	929920	They showed an episode that wasn't out yet.
929920	930920	Does that count?
930920	931920	Sure.
931920	932920	That works.
932920	933920	I love it.
934040	939520	Um, and as Joe and her mat also points out, a lot of my best video game related concerts
939520	940920	have been at magfest.
940920	941920	Okay.
941920	946760	Now let me ask question number two, what video game concert would you like to see?
946760	949120	And it doesn't have to be something that exists.
949120	954480	Just is there like a dream video game related concert that you would just love to see?
954480	958000	Like what would be your dream festival?
958000	959000	Dark soccer.
959000	961080	What would be like a video game concert you would love to see?
961240	965200	I would have liked to have been able to go to the Macross seven live concerts.
965200	968080	Those have been great because Macross seven is probably my favorite of the Macross series
968080	970240	and I love all the music from it.
970240	973040	Um, but I don't, I don't really know.
973040	979360	I mean, I've gotten to see all the concerts I've really wanted to see because I saw gorillas
979360	983480	and there's nothing really else video game or anime or anything related that I would
983480	984480	super want to see.
984480	990920	I mean, if it came up to it, I would really like to have like a whole just synth pop orchestra
991800	994960	of, you know, eight bit or 16 bit music.
994960	995960	That would be really, really fun.
995960	996960	What about you Logie?
996960	999760	If we're going to get ultra ridiculous with this.
999760	1000760	Why not?
1000760	1004880	Um, yeah, I'd say either like something, I would have liked to see something like a DJ
1004880	1010640	hero type thing where they're, you know, mixing stuff together or we'll have like all Eurobeat,
1010640	1018200	you know, what in the middle of a drift racing race, like just like just racing and Eurobeat
1018200	1019200	music.
1019200	1020560	Nice track and Eurobeat.
1020560	1021560	Hell yeah.
1021560	1022560	I'm down for that.
1022560	1023560	That's great.
1023560	1024560	Uh, let's see.
1024560	1028720	For me, I want to see Hatsune Miku just because it's so over the top.
1028720	1031160	Like I just, I have to see it for myself.
1031160	1033760	I have to see what those concerts are like for myself.
1033760	1035400	So that's one that I really want to see.
1035400	1039720	But like my fantasy thing would be, I would love, and I know many of you out there would
1039720	1041200	agree with me, at least I hope you would.
1041200	1047040	I would love to see like a Tetsuya Mizuguchi concert that's like res live.
1047040	1048040	That would be awesome.
1048080	1050720	I want to see Yuzo Koshiro and like do live stuff.
1050720	1051720	Oh yeah.
1051720	1052720	Yuzo Koshiro.
1052720	1053720	That would be cool too.
1053720	1055520	That would be another, that would be a good driving thing as well.
1055520	1059960	Is Jack still doing any of those live venues anymore?
1059960	1061760	I think he's on my Facebook.
1061760	1063280	I thought Tako had a kid.
1063280	1064280	I think so.
1064280	1065280	I don't know.
1065280	1066280	He's on Facebook.
1066280	1070780	I wouldn't mind actually seeing Akira Yamaka do some of his live events.
1070780	1075280	You know, funny enough over in our live chat over at live.vognetwork.com, MXC says I want
1075280	1076720	to go to a Silent Hill concert.
1076720	1078280	There you go.
1078280	1082600	Brad from Paw Culture says the music from Bioshock.
1082600	1087600	As shown under Matt says DDR the orchestra symphonic experience.
1087600	1089400	I love it.
1089400	1092640	Act F agrees that Tetsuya Mizuguchi would be awesome.
1092640	1096720	Also Nobuyoshi Sano would be another dream concert there.
1096720	1101240	Oh man, with Mizuguchi though, can you imagine they can do res, which would be amazing, luminous,
1101240	1104880	which I would love, and Space Channel 5.
1104880	1105880	Yeah.
1106280	1108840	I mean, that's the concert I really want to see.
1108840	1109840	I'm surprised.
1109840	1112160	A live Space Channel 5 demonstration, you know.
1112160	1113160	Heck yeah.
1113160	1115720	The whole audience has to go choo, choo.
1115720	1117840	That would be awesome.
1117840	1118840	All right.
1118840	1121360	Anyway, Fifth Dream closed it up here saying-
1121360	1123560	Holographic Space Michael with that.
1123560	1125960	I want to see one of those Persona concerts.
1125960	1128720	Oh yeah, a hologram concert.
1128720	1130920	Would you go to a Michael Jackson hologram concert?
1130920	1131920	Probably.
1131920	1135320	I was still disappointed they never did that Gorillaz one.
1135760	1139640	Because they were going to do a whole Gorillaz tour that way, but they found a big problem
1139640	1146000	during the Grammy Awards when Madonna came out to do her segment and the bass was so
1146000	1148400	loud that it made the hologram shake.
1148400	1149400	Oh wow.
1149400	1150400	Yeah.
1150400	1157840	So they couldn't manage the decibel level to keep because, you know, light is all a
1157840	1158840	wavelength.
1158840	1159840	Sure.
1159840	1160840	And so is sound.
1160840	1161840	Sure.
1161840	1162840	So one can interfere with the other.
1163360	1165400	All that Hatsune Miku stuff though is all holograms.
1165400	1166400	It is.
1166400	1167400	That's the only thing I can think of.
1167400	1169240	So maybe the technology is better.
1169240	1170240	Well, yeah.
1170240	1172920	Or maybe just with Hatsune Miku it's not as-
1172920	1175560	She doesn't drop the bass like everybody else does.
1175560	1178600	She's super cartoony too, so maybe it's okay to-
1178600	1179600	It's Gorillaz.
1179600	1180600	Yeah, that's true.
1180600	1181600	Gorillaz is pretty cartoony too.
1181600	1182600	I don't know.
1182600	1183600	Anyway.
1183600	1185400	Yeah, Tiger Claw says they could have just turned down the bass.
1185400	1186400	Why not?
1186400	1187400	Anyway.
1187400	1188400	All right.
1188400	1192360	Thank you for indulging my kickoff topic thought here on concerts.
1192880	1196520	Let's move on to our gaming weeks before we get into the week's gaming news.
1196520	1199400	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
1199400	1200400	Dark Soccer.
1200400	1201400	How was your gaming week?
1201400	1202400	It was okay.
1202400	1206800	I've just been really slow, really busy, so I played a lot of pinball.
1206800	1211460	Dan has The Getaway Working, which is the sequel to High Speed.
1211460	1212460	Another Steve Ritchie table.
1212460	1219040	I've played a bit of that and a bit of Black Knight 2000 and Medieval Madness.
1219040	1222540	And that's really about it.
1222540	1226520	That and my phone games, which I'm not going to bother with.
1226520	1228640	Lots of Animal Crossing.
1228640	1231000	So I just want to say, because I've gotten...
1231000	1235280	So remember how before the show you guys were like, why does chat seem so empty tonight?
1235280	1236720	So here's what's going on.
1236720	1239040	It looks like our chat applet isn't working.
1239040	1242440	I've had two people send me private messages that the chat applet isn't working.
1242440	1244380	So hi, if you guys are listening.
1244380	1247240	So that is the live.vog network, it isn't working.
1247240	1249720	So there is another way you can get into the chat room.
1249720	1254160	You have to be somewhat familiar with IRC, unfortunately, but you can go to...
1254160	1260680	If you have an IRC client, you just go anywhere on the Gamesurge network, which is IRC.Gamesurge.net,
1260680	1264240	and then we are in channel or hashtag vog.
1264240	1267080	And that's another way you can find us, an IRC client.
1267080	1269080	Obviously that's a little more complicated and old school.
1269080	1273960	That's why we like to have the chat applet, but Bobby would be my guy to fix those sorts
1273960	1277400	of issues, if it even is something he can fix, I don't know.
1277400	1281000	And unfortunately he is at the concert right now, and so we're just gonna have to dance
1281000	1282000	around that.
1282000	1285160	So I apologize if you guys aren't able to be here live in our chat room.
1285160	1289040	But you can get in the old school way through IRC would be one way to do it.
1289040	1294640	They might actually have an applet at Gamesurge.net that might work.
1294640	1298640	And then again, you just have to join channel vog, because there's a lot of other gaming
1298640	1302400	related channels on the network, but vog is the one that you'd find us in.
1302600	1307160	So good luck to those listening, and I'm sorry the chat applet is down, but it's a little
1307160	1311880	bit above my pay grade right now on where that issue is lying.
1311880	1316120	Alright, if there's nothing else for Dark Soccer's gaming week, then we will head on
1316120	1317120	over to Wokey.
1317120	1322320	I didn't play much this week, but I did usual Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.
1322320	1325960	I played actually some Pokemon Go, a little bit more than usual because I was at more
1325960	1331420	parks, and so I was just doing that, and then I ran into the whole event that they had going
1331420	1332420	on.
1332420	1335440	Well, they have an event going on right now for all the Gen 1 stuff, so that's nice.
1335440	1337500	Double candy and everything.
1337500	1342540	And then they have the sheep one for a few hours, which I didn't have that many spawn.
1342540	1345260	I mean, and I was at a park where there was a ton of shit spawning.
1345260	1349180	It's just two sheep.
1349180	1352500	And then, just a few self-holding games.
1352500	1353500	That's pretty much it.
1353500	1359540	I didn't play any Far Cry, because my wife's been taking the TV with every show.
1359540	1361580	I'm watching like eight shows at once.
1361580	1362580	Great.
1362580	1363580	Good times.
1363580	1365900	Alright, if there's nothing else for you, then my gaming week.
1365900	1369820	I also had a Pokemon Go-filled week, especially today, Community Day.
1369820	1373660	See, we went down to the Capitol, which seemed to be the meeting point.
1373660	1375460	So there's two big parks downtown.
1375460	1378540	There's Capitol Park, which is obviously where the Capitol is, and then there's another one,
1378540	1381860	I think it's Southside is the name of it, South Ridge, Southside Park.
1381860	1384820	Well, Southside Park had a grilled cheese festival.
1384820	1387660	Yes, they brought in all these food trucks to do grilled cheese, and that was the thing.
1387660	1389500	But you had to pay money to get into it.
1389540	1393580	So because of that, all the people that we usually go to Southside were also at the Capitol.
1393580	1395300	So the Capitol was kind of lit today.
1395300	1398840	There was a lot of people there, like a lot of people walking around there.
1398840	1399840	And it was fun.
1399840	1404100	And I almost felt bad, though, because you know how they have the Vietnam Memorial there?
1404100	1408580	They were doing some sort of memorial or tribute.
1408580	1411980	I know it had to be something about memorial because they were playing Amazing Grace.
1411980	1415020	And I almost kind of felt bad because there's like all these like people were being respectful
1415020	1418820	kind of playing around it, you know, so that there's like people aren't going through this
1418820	1419820	event here.
1419820	1423220	But I was just like, oh, man, you know, with all these like people everywhere, that's that's
1423220	1424220	kind of a bummer.
1424220	1426680	But you know, what can you do?
1426680	1427680	But be respectful.
1427680	1429020	That's all you can do.
1429020	1433500	So anyway, but we played at Capitol Park, everything was lured, Pokemon were spawning
1433500	1435520	nonstop, I caught five shiny Mareeps.
1435520	1436520	So I was pretty impressed.
1436520	1440240	I didn't think I was gonna get that many because after the first hour, I only had one.
1440240	1443140	And I was like, all right, well, I'm gonna be happy if I just get out of here with three,
1443140	1446340	like, I'll be super happy, because I can have one of each evolution.
1446340	1447340	But I ended up with five.
1447340	1448920	So I was pretty thrilled with that.
1448920	1452340	So that was that was Community Day.
1452340	1454520	I'm liking these Community Day events a lot.
1454520	1457540	It certainly is working a lot better than Go Fest in Chicago did.
1457540	1459680	I think it's, you know, getting the people out.
1459680	1462200	And people say it's like when the game first came out.
1462200	1466940	But I would say today at Capitol Park was even more people than that.
1466940	1471700	And yeah, just, you know, it's cool to have the incentives for a short time to do a little
1471700	1474940	more walking was good way to get some exercise, hang out with people.
1474940	1478660	So you know, kudos to Niantic on the Pokemon Go Community Days.
1478660	1479980	I had a lot of fun with it.
1479980	1483340	And I look forward to seeing what they do next month because I was expecting since they
1483340	1488020	did Bulbasaur, I thought we would get Charmander, Squirtle would have been the next two months.
1488020	1491220	But then we get Mareep today in the middle of the Kanto events.
1491220	1492380	I don't know what they were thinking.
1492380	1493380	That's weird.
1493380	1494380	But I mean, don't be wrong.
1494380	1496000	The little pink sheep is adorable.
1496000	1502940	So isn't it like, I can't remember the phrase like some comes in like a lamb goes out like
1502940	1504020	a lion or something like that.
1504020	1506460	Is that May or April that they used to say that?
1506460	1507620	I don't know.
1507620	1509660	I know what expression you're talking about, but I don't.
1509660	1510660	Yeah.
1510660	1514860	I thought that maybe in the wine that all got replaced now with it's gonna be May.
1514860	1519620	That's that's the new thing people say around the end of April.
1519620	1522060	Let's see what other games I've been playing this week.
1522060	1525380	A little less Nino Cooney to sadly, I don't think I've really touched a lot of that this
1525380	1526380	week.
1526380	1527380	That's nothing bad.
1527380	1528380	It's just I've actually kind of had a busy week personally.
1528380	1530220	So I haven't had a lot of time for games.
1530220	1535060	But when I am gaming, I'm playing more DJ Max Respect, which I know my music gaming
1535060	1537580	fans are going to be happier to hear that out there.
1537580	1538580	I'm still playing that.
1538580	1540700	I've been playing more six button, eight button songs.
1540700	1542300	I did a stream of it the other night.
1542300	1544660	I am loving the DLC.
1544660	1547420	Like the DLC is what is making that game great.
1547420	1549620	Like the Classic Y DLC is on point.
1549620	1553340	If you have DJ Max Respect, you must buy the Classic Y DLC.
1553340	1555500	It is awesome.
1555500	1556780	All the Classic Y songs are great.
1556780	1557780	And it's not just them.
1557780	1559240	It's other stuff that's mixed in too.
1559240	1562920	So I think it's like 20 bucks, but it's really, really good.
1562920	1567080	I think the reason why DJ Max Respect maybe isn't like flying off the digital shelf is
1567080	1569440	it is still a $50 game.
1569440	1573280	So I think once that game kind of comes down a little bit in price and if they can kind
1573280	1577120	of get it some more visibility on the store or something, I think 20 bucks for the base
1577120	1580080	game and 20 bucks for Classic Y is going to be really hard to argue with.
1580080	1582640	That's going to be a great combo.
1582640	1586600	If you like music games, if you don't like music games, then you probably are not going
1586600	1587600	to like DJ Max Respect.
1587600	1590040	I don't think there's a whole lot there for you.
1590040	1592440	Otherwise, I can't think of a lot.
1592440	1597520	I think I was playing random stuff on Xbox 360 with, or Xbox One, excuse me, with the
1597520	1600000	360 backwards compatibility.
1600000	1602840	And I think I went in there and played Path of Exile for a little bit because that's on
1602840	1606280	Xbox One as a free download and it's on my system.
1606280	1610320	So I played a little bit of that, but nothing, I just spent a ton of time really with any
1610320	1616640	other console or, oh, no, there was one other PC game I'd played a lot of, Overwatch.
1616680	1622080	And yes, I know I play quite a bit of Overwatch all the time anyway, but they did the whole
1622080	1625720	Retribution, I think is the name of it, the event.
1625720	1631200	They started a new event in Overwatch and it's basically the PvE event where you still
1631200	1635000	team up with three other people, but it's a little more like Mass Effect multiplayer
1635000	1640000	was, which I loved where you're doing the waves of enemies that are coming at you.
1640000	1643280	But it's not like, it's not like Mass Effect was all kind of on a stationary map where
1643280	1648040	in this, you kind of move from place to place, you're kind of clearing out the enemies in
1648040	1649040	each place.
1649040	1652040	And then there's some like that are harder, like boss enemies and stuff.
1652040	1653040	So it's great.
1653040	1654560	Like it's a really fun PvE event.
1654560	1658040	And I really wish this was a permanent mode in the game.
1658040	1660000	I kind of think it will be eventually.
1660000	1666680	I think PvE will be how Overwatch does an expansion later on, because I don't see where
1666680	1669520	like this game is going to sustain for years and years and years.
1669520	1675280	I mean, let me rephrase, because obviously there's tons of people that still play online.
1675280	1679840	You have Overwatch League and all this other stuff, but like, you know, how is Overwatch
1679840	1684760	going to keep getting people to drop money on it years and years after release?
1684760	1689840	I mean, sure, they can release new skins and new loot boxes and all that, but I mean, Blizzard,
1689840	1693200	what works for them in other places, what they've done for Diablo, what they've done
1693200	1696760	for World of Warcraft, what they've done for all these other games, they do expansions.
1696800	1702120	So I think Overwatch would be great to do like a PvE expansion would work really well
1702120	1707560	for them that takes these modes like Retribution and the Uprising they did last year and kind
1707560	1709440	of expand on it.
1709440	1713240	That way they could do something that isn't like new heroes, right?
1713240	1717360	Because that would be the tempting thing is that you put new heroes in an expansion, but
1717360	1720600	people would probably be kind of irritated about that because they'd be like, well, wait,
1720600	1723880	all the heroes are supposed to be for free, but they could put like this PvE and it would
1723880	1726760	be like a completely separate experience for Overwatch in an expansion.
1726760	1730440	And I think that would make a lot of sense for where Blizzard could go next.
1730440	1733520	But I mean, we'll see, I guess.
1733520	1737800	Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, some folks agree with me on my positive feeling
1737800	1739400	for Overwatch Retribution.
1739400	1742840	Vidpower says Overwatch Retribution is legit.
1742840	1745160	Actf says Overwatch Retribution is pretty awesome.
1745160	1748560	It felt like Left 4 Dead for me.
1748560	1752800	And Actf says the bosses in Retribution are kind of like Left 4 Dead bosses.
1752800	1755520	So good comparison there.
1755520	1756520	Yeah, Left 4 Dead.
1756520	1757520	I always forget about that.
1757520	1758520	You know why?
1758520	1761040	Because there hasn't been a new one in years.
1761040	1768200	So anyway, if you have Overwatch, even though I'm talking about expansion PvE, this Retribution
1768200	1769340	thing is a free event.
1769340	1772680	So go check it out and yeah.
1772680	1778400	And hopefully at some point the game, I will get good favor and I will get my Kris Jenner
1778400	1782700	Sombra outfit because there's a new outfit for Sombra that makes her look like Kris Jenner
1782700	1783900	and I want it.
1783900	1786860	So yes, I do not have it yet.
1786860	1788580	I haven't gotten a single.
1788580	1791180	I've probably gained like four levels.
1791180	1792540	Got all my loot boxes for the week.
1792540	1799580	I haven't gotten a single skin that's unique to the Retribution event and I'm a little
1799580	1800580	huffy about it.
1800580	1802140	So hopefully next week my luck will turn around.
1802140	1803140	We'll see.
1803140	1805140	All right.
1805140	1808180	Actf in chat says I need the Moira Blackwatch costume.
1808180	1811060	I have been having a lot more fun playing Moira.
1811060	1812060	She is a lot of fun.
1812420	1816380	Now that I'm learning how to use her better, where I use her little dart thing where she
1816380	1821260	goes invisible for a minute to get behind enemies or get behind the other team and maybe
1821260	1826280	in a room or something to get behind them and zap them, it's so much fun.
1826280	1829780	But I've been doing a lot of streaming with my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realist and
1829780	1831100	he always picks Moira.
1831100	1834740	But that's fine because at least you know the team has a healer and I get to play something
1834740	1837180	like Junkrat or Pharah, which I also enjoy playing a lot.
1837180	1839620	So there you go.
1839620	1840620	All right.
1840620	1841620	Let's see.
1842180	1845380	I don't know of any shows off we have coming up until June.
1845380	1848080	I know you're not going to be here for a week or two, Jamie.
1848080	1851900	You're going to be going to Drag Con, not Dragun Con, but Drag Con.
1851900	1852900	Yes.
1852900	1854700	I'll be getting a different kind of geek on.
1854700	1855700	That'll be fun.
1855700	1856700	You're gonna have a lot of fun with that.
1856700	1860280	I'm a little jealous I can't go, but you know, it is what it is.
1860280	1863260	So you'll be gone for a couple or a week, maybe two in May.
1863260	1864260	Possibly.
1864260	1866420	It depends on if I can get back in time on Sunday.
1866420	1867420	But we'll still be.
1867420	1868420	Loki and I'll still be here.
1868420	1869420	Yes.
1869420	1872540	We might invite invite a friend of ours to take the third chair that night and keep on
1872540	1873900	going here.
1873900	1876660	We will have the week after our 16th anniversary.
1876660	1878660	Oh my God.
1878660	1879660	Show's old enough to drive.
1879660	1880660	Our 16th anniversary.
1880660	1882620	The week after that, we will be off.
1882620	1886580	That's always a great way to reward ourselves with a birthday is a week off.
1886580	1890140	Anyway, you can always follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O.L.R.
1890140	1893540	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1893540	1896140	And again, if you're just joining us this evening and you're having problems getting
1896140	1899140	in the chat room, apparently it's a pretty widespread issue.
1899140	1902680	I guess even the game surge clients and folks are having problems with that.
1902680	1903680	So I apologize.
1903680	1907500	It looks like the only way you can really get in is with an IRC client, which I use
1907500	1910100	M.I.R.C. on my PC here in the studio.
1910100	1912860	I do know that some exist on the phones.
1912860	1916680	You can get IRC apps for your phones, but a lot of those cost money.
1916680	1920420	So and, you know, I don't think you should have to pay money unless you really, really,
1920420	1921420	really want to.
1921420	1926700	I should always give a shout out for our Discord as well, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
1926700	1931260	I don't really read live comments from the Discord because it's just too much to monitor
1931260	1932980	more than one chat room.
1932980	1935140	But you can always leave us a feedback there.
1935140	1936300	And we do read it throughout the week.
1936300	1937300	We do interact.
1937300	1940900	It's a good it's a better chance to actually get us to write in chat is by using our Discord.
1940900	1945540	So if you're not already there, check that out, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
1945540	1951620	And in our chat, actdeft recommends Andro IRC is free and pretty easy to use.
1951620	1952860	Yeah, I think that's what I have.
1952860	1957300	That must be an Android thing because I don't have it because I'm on iPhone.
1957300	1963000	The one I have on iPhone is called, oh, hell, what is it called?
1963000	1965300	Something lime something is what it's called.
1965300	1966300	Lime chat.
1966300	1967300	Yeah, lime chat.
1967300	1968300	That's what I have.
1968300	1969300	But I had to pay five bucks for it.
1969300	1971940	So not everybody may agree with me there.
1971940	1972940	So.
1972940	1973940	All right.
1973940	1974940	Anyway.
1975660	1977100	Our listener is that I'm looking.
1977100	1980200	She just sent me another picture of the game surge thing not working either.
1980200	1981200	So yeah.
1981200	1982200	What a mess.
1982200	1983200	Sorry, guys.
1983200	1987560	Hopefully it's something that if it's not working on game surges own site, that's something
1987560	1991220	that they're gonna have to take a look at that will probably get fixed in the next week.
1991220	1994760	So it's it's a temporary thing, I guess.
1994760	1995760	All right.
1995760	1998580	Let's move on to some actual gaming news.
1998580	1999580	For now.
1999580	2000580	Loki.
2000580	2004900	Yeah, this is kind of unusual, but I guess it's something that we can expect.
2004900	2009180	Since they're partnering up with Microsoft for this cross play stuff.
2009180	2015740	So Microsoft is doing that Minecraft Better Together update that's going out to all the
2015740	2019140	different platforms that Minecraft is on.
2019140	2020340	One of those being the Switch.
2020340	2027200	And with that, because, you know, it is forcing you to basically create an Xbox Live account
2027200	2032220	in order to be able to communicate across platforms, you also get achievements.
2032220	2035820	So you can actually earn achievements in the Switch version of the game.
2035820	2038660	Well, Microsoft achievements.
2038660	2040980	And then also on other platforms as well.
2040980	2044220	So like mobile platforms and stuff, you can earn achievements as well.
2044220	2049780	So it's pretty interesting that the first achievement system that will be on Nintendo's
2049780	2054060	platform will actually be Microsoft's.
2054060	2055940	That is so weird to me.
2055940	2059260	But at the same time, okay, is it but it's not necessarily I mean, I know a lot of the
2059260	2062740	headline grabbing stuff is saying, oh, it's Xbox achievements.
2062740	2069140	But technically, the Microsoft system is built into Windows as well, right?
2069140	2070140	Right.
2070140	2075220	Yeah, you can actually download like Microsoft Solitaire and micro like a lot of the stuff
2075220	2079420	in Microsoft Store, which I know not everybody uses all the time.
2079420	2082620	But if you actually go to Microsoft Store, you can actually see some of their free games
2082620	2083620	in there.
2083620	2085860	And some of them have achievements like there's like a minesweeper game with achievements
2085860	2087780	and all that, that you get on PC.
2087780	2091660	And they also tie into what was classically your Xbox score.
2091660	2093220	So it's not really an Xbox thing.
2093220	2094340	It's a Microsoft thing.
2094340	2095340	Yeah.
2095340	2100660	So knowing that Microsoft now owns Minecraft, is this as big of a leap as some of these
2100660	2102840	sensationalist headlines are making us believe?
2102840	2106660	It's interesting just because it's not really a Microsoft platform per se.
2106660	2108900	It's other systems.
2108900	2112500	Can you imagine getting Xbox achievements on, you know, the PlayStation?
2112500	2113500	Yeah.
2114140	2118420	Well, some of the funny shit I'm reading is that, well, Nintendo should just let Microsoft
2118420	2121180	design their achievement system, you know.
2121180	2126460	Why even just let them design their achievement system and just have them do the online system?
2126460	2128780	Why not just let Nintendo connect to Xbox Live?
2128780	2131980	Why not just be done with all of it and just while we're at it, hey, why don't we just
2131980	2136300	let Nintendo games play on the Xbox, you know, one?
2136300	2138020	Form an alliance to take out something.
2138020	2139020	Let's just do that.
2139020	2140780	It'll give everybody what they want.
2140980	2148740	We'll have a solid online network for the Switch and people will get, you know, Nintendo
2148740	2153060	being a third-party developer for other systems.
2153060	2154060	It's win-win.
2154060	2161380	Looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Rama in chat says, yes, Minecraft is cross-platform.
2161380	2165020	Just remember that they're the ones hosting the servers for the game, which explains the
2165020	2166500	need for a Microsoft account.
2166500	2171860	Oh, yes, that's come up before with the whole cross-platform and why Sony was like, oh,
2171860	2176340	hell to the nah as to why they were not going to go cross-platform because they did not
2176340	2179540	want people to have to have a Microsoft account to play it because it's a little silly.
2179540	2182940	Well, I kind of get it.
2182940	2184100	I kind of get it.
2184100	2185100	You know what I mean?
2185100	2188780	Like, you know, Sony's not going to bend over and give Microsoft that one.
2188780	2189780	You know what I mean?
2189780	2191300	Oh, you're not going to play nice with our system.
2191300	2194740	Well, we're just not going to let you play with your friends.
2194740	2196780	You can just go buy another system and do that.
2196780	2202060	I'm honestly surprised that Microsoft continues to release Minecraft for the PlayStation,
2202060	2203420	to be quite honest.
2203420	2208700	I would think that Microsoft would have made that essentially a Microsoft exclusive, an
2208700	2210940	Xbox exclusive, a PC exclusive.
2210940	2214740	Although I can see again maybe where it does benefit them, especially with the Switch being
2214740	2218380	portable and everything, to continue to do it for the Switch.
2218380	2221660	But I'm really surprised that Microsoft just didn't say, you know, we're just going to
2221660	2222660	drop the PlayStation.
2222660	2224620	Minecraft 2 comes out eventually.
2224620	2226700	Oh, it'll be on it.
2226700	2228860	They're fucking assholes about it.
2228860	2230460	Maybe we don't need to release it on the same platform.
2230460	2233620	Do you think Minecraft 2 will have, I've been, I'm kind of sick of predicting it.
2233620	2238260	I feel like every, I've said to every E3 for the past two or three years, I said, Microsoft
2238260	2239900	bought Minecraft.
2239900	2242300	They're going to put out Minecraft 2.
2242300	2244700	It has to happen someday.
2244700	2245700	And yeah, I agree.
2245700	2248780	When Minecraft 2 comes out, it'll be out on Xbox and PC first.
2248780	2250620	I don't think they're actually going to release Minecraft 2.
2250660	2254980	They have their whole storefront is where they're making their money, I think, allegedly.
2254980	2255980	Allegedly.
2255980	2256980	All right.
2256980	2257980	I don't know.
2257980	2263460	I would, I mean, yeah, maybe you have to be like some really, you know, breathtakingly
2263460	2265100	advanced thing.
2265100	2269580	Rama in chat says Minecraft isn't exclusive because Microsoft owns the company itself
2269580	2272180	for releasing the game, not the game.
2272180	2273180	That's the difference.
2273180	2274180	Well, yes and no.
2274180	2280580	I mean, Microsoft would still, would be well within their rights still to tell said company,
2280580	2284860	well, because we ultimately own you, you're not putting this out on Sony's platform.
2284860	2288660	Now I'm sure they're, and to be fair, the reason why they are still releasing it for
2288660	2292860	PlayStation is that people are buying it on PlayStation and they're making money at the
2292860	2293860	end of the day.
2293860	2294860	So that's fine.
2294860	2297300	They don't need to necessarily ban it from the system, what they could do.
2297300	2298300	Timed exclusive.
2298300	2299900	You get it a year later.
2299900	2300900	That's true.
2301020	2305780	You know, this isn't, the Minecraft is also not the first example of a Microsoft related
2305780	2311700	studio doing this because Viva Pinata was on the DS of it, like not the exact same Viva
2311700	2312700	Pinata game, but you know what I mean?
2312700	2315040	There was like a spinoff game that was on the DS.
2315040	2316540	And I think it's that same type of logic.
2316540	2318600	It wasn't coming from Microsoft.
2318600	2322380	It was coming from, you know, one of their own studios, but
2322380	2323800	Ah yes, Viva Pinata.
2323800	2324800	That was going to be a thing.
2324800	2325800	Yeah.
2325800	2331440	Well, I mean, they did, they did get a TV show and they, they, they, they almost had
2331440	2332440	it.
2332440	2333440	Yeah.
2333440	2334440	There was a Viva Pinata cartoon.
2334440	2335440	Don't you remember?
2335440	2336440	No.
2336440	2337440	Where were you?
2337440	2338440	It wasn't, it wasn't very long, but there was one.
2338440	2342200	Vidpower says Viva Pinata games were so good.
2342200	2345220	So some people, they were, they were fans with that.
2345220	2351480	So SSG100Matt in chat says, it's like Disney going to take away all their Disney movies
2351480	2355720	along with their properties from Netflix when they come out with their own service.
2355720	2356800	Oh yeah.
2356800	2360920	And that's why I kind of think Disney sucks for doing that.
2360920	2367180	But at the same time, like Netflix and Hulu and those companies, they are stepping it
2367180	2370360	up when it comes to creating originals.
2370360	2371360	You know what I mean?
2371360	2374400	Like, there are so many originals on both those that are coming out.
2374400	2375400	And Oh, darn.
2375400	2378840	Oh, I can't watch my digital versions of Disney movies.
2378840	2381640	Oh wait, there's piracy on the internet.
2381640	2382960	That's right.
2382960	2385480	I guess I'll just pirate that.
2385480	2390720	I actually think the Disney service stands to do very well because kids, people are going
2390720	2394400	to be like, wait a minute, I can just pay $10 a month and have a babysitter with like
2394400	2396600	an infinite supply of movies.
2396600	2397600	Yes, please.
2397600	2398600	That's what they're going to do.
2398600	2400760	Or you can just pay $0 a month and put them on YouTube.
2400760	2401760	Kids app.
2401760	2402760	Okay.
2402760	2403760	Here's the reality though.
2403760	2407720	If that Disney thing, and tell me if y'all agree in chat over at live.vognetwork.com
2407760	2408760	If you can get in.
2408760	2409760	Sorry.
2409760	2413800	So it's, it's hardwired in my brain to keep saying live.vognetwork.com and I realized
2413800	2414800	the chat room is down.
2414800	2415800	I'm sorry.
2415800	2421800	Um, but, uh, here's the thing that would get me to, uh, instantly purchase that Disney
2421800	2427360	thing if they have a Tron related anything, if they bring back Tron uprising or whatever
2427360	2429600	the anime was, I would, I'd do it.
2429600	2430600	You're shaking your head.
2430600	2431600	You wouldn't do it.
2431600	2432600	They wouldn't do it.
2432600	2433600	It wouldn't do it.
2433600	2434600	You gotta do something Tron.
2434600	2437480	We had some stories on shaking and crying about some interesting reboots.
2438240	2439240	They were talking about doing on Disney.
2439240	2440240	Yeah.
2440240	2441240	Like Tron.
2441240	2442240	Oh, Tron.
2442240	2443240	Wasn't one of them.
2443240	2444240	I don't think.
2444240	2445240	You're supposed to be rebooting that.
2445240	2446240	Really?
2446240	2447240	Well, I'm speaking of reboots.
2447240	2449680	They rebooted reboot and it's fucking terrible.
2449680	2451840	It's like, what the hell is this shit?
2451840	2454280	Like I saw reboot, I'm like, Ooh, reboot.
2454280	2457800	And I'm like, well, wait, what's all this live action bullshit.
2457800	2465000	Uh, anyway, um, yeah, I just on the whole like Hulu and Netflix and all this and how
2465080	2466080	they're competing thing.
2466080	2471280	Like, um, I know y'all know, I watch a lot of RuPaul's drag race and I have a podcast
2471280	2474240	that I host with some friends about it called reading is fundamental.
2474240	2480760	Um, but in following drag race and stuff, they used to tape their show.
2480760	2484640	Drag race was done at the Hollywood center studios for years and years, which is right
2484640	2489120	in the heart of Hollywood, like right off of Hollywood Boulevard, which is not the most
2489120	2492400	glamorous part of town, but there were some studios there.
2492400	2497680	They have not been able to film there for the past couple of years because, and as Ru
2497680	2504640	said on, on his podcast, uh, Netflix and Hulu have rented all that space for like a year
2504640	2505640	out.
2505640	2507320	So they've had to tape the most recent season.
2507320	2511080	That's why a drag race season 10 looks different because they taped it at a whole different
2511080	2512080	studio.
2512080	2514800	They're out in the Valley now or something.
2514800	2520040	I can see that because they have like, was it the Joel McHale show and oh my God.
2520040	2522200	Now they just like lost in space.
2522200	2523200	Just came out this year.
2523200	2527400	I watched, it was, it was all right.
2527400	2535440	It was like, eh, this is a, I mean this is sort of lost in space, but it's like, okay.
2535440	2538600	Brad from pop culture and chat just marathon the lost in space reboot.
2538600	2539840	That's what he says there.
2539840	2540840	I watched the first episode.
2540840	2541840	It was all right.
2541840	2545080	I mean, it's just like, I was, I don't know.
2545080	2546680	I like, it might get better.
2546680	2548240	Yeah, I'll, I'll check it out.
2548240	2549240	I never was a huge fan.
2549240	2550240	Like I liked the movie.
2550240	2554200	I liked the remade movie that they did, which was pretty much terrible, but I liked it anyways.
2554200	2559160	Um, and I was like, okay, I'll give this a chance, but it was all right.
2559160	2560760	And I mean, I don't know.
2560760	2563120	It was a little, it's funny though.
2563120	2568200	It's like, like, don't get me wrong then the show is like, it's pretty, there's a lot of
2568200	2569200	drama in the show.
2569200	2572800	Like, I mean, it's pretty intense, I think for kids and stuff, but they have it in the
2572800	2574400	Netflix kids section.
2574400	2579000	I'm like, uh, I can't see my kids watching that in this.
2579000	2581040	They just have a thicker skin this day and age.
2581040	2582680	It's like, oh fuck, no they don't.
2582680	2586600	There's probably kids watching Stranger Things and like, there's a few scenes in Stranger
2586600	2589160	Things that are like, I don't know if I'd want a kid to see that.
2589160	2591740	But they did have the remade Speed Racer on there.
2591740	2595800	The Speed Racer movie, the Wachowski one that everyone hates that I think is fantastic.
2595800	2598000	But um, I'm like trying to get my kids to watch that.
2598000	2599320	That movie has its fans though.
2599320	2604560	But they, they, they, they only want to watch random episodes of different Power Rangers
2604560	2605560	stuff now.
2605560	2607080	My son is just like super in the Power Rangers.
2607080	2608080	Oh my God.
2608080	2611240	Why haven't you just hired Shane as a babysitter?
2611240	2612600	They could all do that together.
2612600	2613600	It's just like that.
2613600	2616120	He just, he loves Power Rangers.
2616120	2617120	He keeps asking.
2617120	2618120	Are you sure?
2618120	2619120	Are you sure?
2619120	2620120	Sure.
2620120	2621120	He's your kid.
2621120	2622120	Yes.
2622120	2626460	Cause I, I, well the second one, no, technically I did not see the second one removed from
2626460	2627460	my wife.
2627460	2630600	She had to go on surgery and it was an emergency surgery so they could have swapped it with
2630600	2631840	somebody else.
2631840	2633640	The first one I know is mine.
2633640	2634640	Okay.
2634640	2636360	Or at least I know it was my wife's.
2636360	2637360	Oh my God.
2637360	2638360	I'm dying.
2638360	2639360	All right.
2639360	2640360	Anyway.
2640360	2645840	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
2645840	2648640	use the passphrase, mom.
2648640	2649640	Let's move on.
2649640	2650640	Change the subject, please.
2650640	2651640	All right.
2651640	2657200	Let's talk a little bit about, uh, this actually, it doesn't just affect a Nintendo, but there's
2657200	2662200	a lot of gaming blogs that are running this on how this affects Nintendo because if you've
2662200	2665880	ever had a Nintendo warranty, which, you know, if you buy a Nintendo product, there
2665880	2667080	is a warranty.
2667080	2671980	You probably haven't read a lot of it, but anyway, the warranty does state this warranty
2671980	2677440	shall not apply if this product is used with products not sold or licensed by Nintendo.
2677440	2683460	So you may not have known that, but like remember when the third party doc was bricking consoles?
2683460	2687560	Technically Nintendo can wash their hands of that because you voided your warranty because
2687560	2689920	you used it with products not sold or licensed by Nintendo.
2689920	2693680	But then I'm thinking, God, how many third party stuff is like right there on the shelf?
2693680	2694680	Like it's pretty crazy.
2694680	2695680	Anyway.
2695680	2696680	Well guess what?
2696680	2703600	Because the FTC this week put out a statement that says policies like this are illegal.
2703600	2704600	That's right.
2704600	2709820	According to the FTC quote, unless warrenters provide the parts or services for free or
2709820	2716440	receive a waiver from the FTC, such statements generally are prohibited by the Magnuson Moss
2716440	2720940	warranty act, a law that governs consumer product warranties.
2720940	2724820	So the FTC actually sent Nintendo a letter warning them of this.
2724820	2727480	And so Nintendo is going to have to change their wording.
2727480	2730240	So I had heard of this affecting other stuff in the industry as well.
2730240	2734420	So it's very, I heard that this also applied to like, you know, televisions, well just
2734420	2736380	anything that has like warranty voided.
2736380	2740820	If you remove this sticker type thing, pillows, if you cut the tag illegal, if you cut the
2740820	2742920	tag, well, that's illegal.
2742920	2747820	If you cut the tag before you, I know, I know it's before you purchase, yeah, I know
2747820	2748820	it's different.
2748820	2749820	Anyway.
2749820	2753220	Um, but yeah, the, uh, that's, that's a very interesting thing about warranty.
2753220	2756140	So Nintendo is going to have to, I guess, kind of be nice, nice with the third party
2756140	2760700	stuff now, or they've got to go get a waiver or they're going to have to hold themselves
2760700	2762400	to this some other way.
2762400	2766520	So that is interesting how that ruling is having a pretty big effect on gaming, especially
2766520	2767520	again.
2767520	2771680	I can't help but think of Nintendo in the third party docs, so, all right, moving on
2771680	2774840	Dark Sakura, let's go to your next story.
2774840	2784200	It is an end of an era because the king has been dethroned, deposed, and there's drama.
2784200	2788000	Isn't there always drama in classic arcade gaming?
2788000	2793120	Well, um, and this, I'm sure everyone knows it by now, but Billy Mitchell has been ousted
2793120	2799160	from twin galaxies for cheating because the points that he submitted, um, his one of the
2799160	2807960	1,047,200 point score on Donkey Kong was proven to have been done with an, uh, emulator.
2807960	2813800	And they do have an emulator category, but he submitted it as having been on the original,
2813800	2816160	um, hardware.
2816160	2823600	And, um, as it stands, um, he is actually banned from taking part in further competitions
2823600	2828880	in the future, um, and they submitted the findings to the Guinness Book of World Records
2828880	2831280	to strike his record there too.
2831280	2837080	Um, and he is completely banned, including his achievements in Pac-Man as well.
2837080	2843860	So yeah, he has, and it's funny, there was a conversation that, uh, Dan had this morning
2843860	2849440	with one of his buddies on the phone where when, um, Walter, uh, what's his name?
2849440	2850440	Walter Day.
2850440	2856840	Yeah, that for him, it was easy to overlook even if he knew it was going on because Billy
2856840	2859920	Mitchell was a good PR guy.
2859920	2863600	Billy Mitchell brought attention, more attention to twin galaxies, especially then when we
2863600	2867400	had the whole King of Kong going on, even though it painted him as the villain in their
2867400	2868400	little story.
2868400	2873280	You know, that was an exercise in hyperbole, but, um, didn't you, didn't you meet, didn't
2873280	2875960	we meet Walter Day once?
2875960	2877040	I'm all positive we did.
2877040	2878040	You know why?
2878040	2879040	Okay.
2879040	2883040	So before we were here at VOG Network, we were on another network, um, called all games.com
2883040	2885680	and they're still around and kicking and I got nothing but good things to say about them.
2885680	2886680	Go check them out.
2886680	2888280	Cause I got a lot of great indie gaming podcasts too.
2888280	2894120	Um, but all games.com, the time we were there, they had that show, All Games Interactive,
2894120	2898920	which was Scott and, uh, um, um, Lawrence and all them host that show.
2898920	2903760	Well, that show kind of became Drama Central for classic arcade gaming.
2903760	2906280	And I'm not saying that in a negative way.
2906280	2908800	Anybody that listened to it during those years would agree with me.
2908800	2912840	It became Drama Central for these classic arcade gaming disputes because of the whole
2912840	2918440	Mr. Awesome saga and the whole missile command stuff like this went on for like years, right
2918440	2919440	on that shot.
2919440	2920660	Like I swear to God, they never made it.
2920660	2924220	So anyway, my point is, it's just, it's kind of funny that like all these years later,
2924220	2927920	this drama is still going when I'm sitting in the back of my mind going, you know, the
2927920	2933400	common denominator in all of this with all due respect is Walter Day.
2933400	2938120	I'm just, but you, but you, well, and this just plays into what you're about to say,
2938120	2939120	right?
2939120	2943960	Well, it's just that, you know, it seems to me that he would have been willing to turn
2943960	2948960	to blind eye when it's, you know, one of his PR, you know, one of the people bringing a
2948960	2954900	lot of good attention to twin galaxies, but now there's new blood and who apparently isn't
2954900	2956480	going to stand for any cheating.
2956480	2961320	And I'm, I'm glad for that because it sullies the reputation and good standing of using
2961320	2964320	twin galaxies as some sort of standard.
2964320	2971240	So and on top of that, it's not like it needs, you know, Billy Mitchell's reputation behind
2971240	2973200	it anymore.
2973200	2980360	I don't think that he's made a comment on it himself, but honestly enough, I, it's sad,
2980360	2984080	but I'm not, I don't really feel sorry for him.
2984080	2987640	If you cheat, you deserve to be held accountable for it.
2987640	2995200	And if this is what being held accountable is, it'll set a really good warning for other
2995200	2997640	others who would cheat the same way.
2997640	3004440	So I, I approve.
3004440	3010600	I think what's kind of sad about the whole thing is the fact that Billy Mitchell, like,
3010600	3012280	he wasn't bad at Donkey Kong.
3012280	3013680	No, he was really good.
3013680	3016240	You know, he has played the game live.
3016240	3018920	And I realized there's this whole dispute about the tape and this is where this all
3018920	3019920	comes from.
3019920	3023480	But the reality is he's played the game in front of live audiences and has performed
3023480	3027720	well, certainly better than I would certainly better than most people would.
3027720	3031000	So I mean, why did he do this to himself?
3031000	3032000	You know what I mean?
3032000	3037920	Like, well, I mean, you know, I say that when I know full well, the answer that sometimes
3037920	3039580	being good, isn't good enough.
3039580	3043800	You have to be the best, especially with the whole, you know, the movie and the drama and
3043800	3044800	all that stuff.
3044800	3045800	You know, I get it.
3045800	3049840	And you know, I was, I was kind of bummed reading this because I got to meet Billy at
3049840	3056680	the last Dragon Con because he's usually there signing autographs and whatever, doing his,
3056680	3059440	you know, giving away his hot sauce and all that.
3059440	3063560	According to SSJ100 Matt, he actually did put out a statement on YouTube.
3063560	3064560	He did.
3064560	3066960	And I was actually going to bring that up because I just haven't had a chance to listen
3066960	3067960	to it.
3067960	3071520	I read, there was an article that was run on it that had some little like bits and pieces
3071520	3072520	from it.
3072520	3074040	And of course I've since closed it.
3074040	3075040	Darn it.
3075280	3077280	The link is in the chat.
3077280	3081560	The important question is, does his hot sauce have anything to do with Donkey Kong as far
3081560	3083560	as the naming of his hot sauce.
3083560	3087840	Although I think Donkey Kong isn't making him money.
3087840	3089720	Twin Galaxies don't have money.
3089720	3095640	But it can't hurt though to have a reputation from that and say, by the way, I'm selling
3095640	3096640	this.
3096640	3097640	Sure.
3097640	3098640	Okay.
3098640	3099640	So there is a whole YouTube thing.
3099640	3100640	And he went on.
3100640	3101640	Is it long?
3101640	3102640	It's a minute and 10 seconds.
3102640	3103640	You want me to play the whole thing?
3103640	3104640	Why not?
3105240	3106240	Let's let the man defend himself.
3106240	3111280	I need to say this is courtesy YouTube just to make myself legally in the clear.
3111280	3114640	This is courtesy of YouTube and the user account on YouTube.
3114640	3119260	If you want to watch this for yourself is still loading on my hand because I have a
3119260	3121600	slowest dirt computer here.
3121600	3128120	It is Ryan Burger is the YouTube account that has posted this as a part of old school gamer
3128120	3129120	magazine.
3129120	3130120	Here it is.
3130120	3131240	Hi, I'm Billy Mitchell.
3131240	3133560	We're here at the Midwest Gaming Classic.
3133560	3136320	I'm here with old school gamer magazine.
3136320	3140280	I've been asked to address things that are recently in the media.
3140280	3148200	The fact of the matter is now there is a true professional due diligence being done to investigate
3148200	3154120	things that happened as far as 35 years ago in a professional manner, not in a shock jock
3154120	3156880	mentality designed to create hits.
3156880	3161960	We will show that everything that has been done, everything was done professionally.
3162360	3170280	According to the rules, according to the scoreboard, the integrity that was set up, not 2014 forward
3170280	3174680	by the current regime who wants to reach back 35 years.
3174680	3176920	Everything will be transparent.
3176920	3177920	Everything will be available.
3177920	3182880	I wish I had it in my hands right now and wish I could hand it to you, but it's taken
3182880	3188800	a considerable amount of time, witnesses, documents, everything will be made available
3188800	3189800	to you.
3189800	3190800	Nothing will be withheld.
3191240	3193240	You absolutely have my commitment to that.
3193240	3199240	We've been at this since 1982 and it's not going to stop now.
3199240	3200240	So there it is.
3200240	3203400	And that is again, courtesy of YouTube, old school gamer magazine.
3203400	3204960	And I was very drunk.
3204960	3208720	It was, well, it was a very, it was a lot of fluff because it's basically one of those,
3208720	3212000	I don't have anything now, but I'm working on it type of things.
3212000	3216040	Here's what I found most interesting in that whole little apology is, well, actually, no,
3216040	3217040	I shouldn't say apology.
3217080	3222520	The whole little, whatever it was, uh, is that he mentions the rules as they were set
3222520	3227440	up 35 years ago, not 2014 through the current regime.
3227440	3233220	So that, that struck me as very interesting is that he's taking issue with the way things
3233220	3235700	have been run in the past couple of years.
3235700	3238160	And like he feels that somehow the rules have changed.
3238160	3241500	Although I would think in emulators, I think that's pretty consistent, but I would be very
3241500	3245000	curious to see what he's going to come up with in this whole regard.
3245000	3246800	So very interesting.
3246800	3249360	Loki, anything you want to add to this?
3249360	3250360	Nope.
3250360	3251360	I know.
3251360	3252360	It's like, what else?
3252360	3253720	What else can you say?
3253720	3259520	My gosh, just that, uh, Peter Dinklage sure did pull off quite the, uh, impression of
3259520	3262040	him in pixels.
3262040	3263040	Stop it.
3263040	3264040	All right.
3264040	3265040	Uh, let's see.
3265040	3267880	S200 Matt and chat says document statements and everything will come out when I learned
3267880	3268880	Photoshop.
3268880	3269880	There you go.
3269880	3270880	All right.
3270880	3273600	Vid power calls it Kong gate over in our chat room.
3273600	3274940	All right.
3274940	3275940	Let's move on.
3275940	3281440	You know, I just, it's, it's kind of drama and I just, I hope everybody can resolve this,
3281440	3282500	but I do hope it's fair.
3282500	3288340	You know, if he didn't do the score the right way, they didn't do the score the right way.
3288340	3289340	And that's that.
3289340	3290860	So, all right, let's move on.
3290860	3291860	Loki.
3291860	3292860	All right.
3292860	3293980	So this is pretty awesome.
3293980	3300700	So you may remember there's a whole backwards compatibility with Xbox 360 on the Xbox one.
3300700	3308420	And now there's Xbox original backwards compatibility on the Xbox one as well.
3308420	3313740	So they've just added, um, their first set of games, which released on April 17th.
3313740	3318100	So blinks, the time sweeper breakdown, conquer live and reloaded, elder scrolls three Morrow
3318100	3324240	in hunter, the reckoning Jade empire, Panzer Dragoon, orta, and SSX three.
3324240	3329180	The second batch is actually coming out in a couple of weeks here on the 26th and you'll
3329180	3334820	get destroy all humans, full spectrum warrior, mercenaries, playground of destruction, MX
3334820	3339500	unleashed, Panzer elite action, fields of glory, star Wars, battlefront, the original
3339500	3340980	service bell for it.
3340980	3345900	And the original star was bell front to star Wars, Jedi Knight, Jedi Academy, star Wars,
3345900	3350860	Jedi star fighter, star Wars, Knights of the older public to the Sith Lords and star Wars
3350860	3353180	command or Republic commando.
3353180	3356980	We'll all be backwards compatible at that time.
3357980	3362980	So that's kind of pretty cool that they're still supporting this stuff, even systems
3362980	3364660	like a couple of systems ago.
3364660	3365660	Yeah.
3365660	3368460	Can't say the same about certain other companies.
3368460	3372780	And I'm talking right now, I'm talking both the other companies, you know, cause
3372780	3373780	Good point.
3373780	3374780	Yeah.
3374780	3375780	Fair point.
3375780	3376780	Yeah.
3376780	3377780	And there's no virtual console still.
3377780	3381460	Uh, so, uh, with the Xbox stuff though, I mean, it's not just about the fact that they
3381460	3386280	can support games from 10 years ago, but the fact that they can resell them for a value
3386280	3391300	that's much greater than what these games are going for at game used game places.
3391300	3394700	So does that mean that with these games, like say star Wars, battlefront or battlefront
3394700	3399200	too, that the multiplayer servers are back online because couldn't you go play multiplayer
3399200	3400200	on these things still?
3400200	3402940	Or I don't know the answer to that, unfortunately.
3402940	3406620	Um, I think if they were running through EA servers, no, if they're running through
3406620	3411280	Xbox live, they might work, but, um, I don't think they do.
3411280	3414200	I think they were EA servers and I don't think they still run.
3414200	3417720	So, um, but, uh, yeah, you do on steam.
3417720	3419880	So if you go on steam and do it, there you go.
3419880	3423480	But these games are nine 99 and pop, I think if you want to, but so like old Xbox first
3423480	3427800	gen Xbox stuff for nine 99 and pop, I mean, you could probably find these discs for like
3427800	3431520	four bucks, probably even less than a dollar.
3431520	3436900	I mean, so if you do find them, that's great cause you have the value that you can play
3436900	3437900	them here.
3437900	3441160	But I mean, there is something to be said about getting these games to be backwards
3441160	3443880	compatible so that they can sell them all over again, basically.
3443880	3449200	On top of that, it's like, I think if Moro wins 15, I think there's charging even more
3449200	3450200	from all right.
3450200	3455680	And on top of all that, I mean, this is kind of like, you know, the totally not necessary.
3455680	3461680	I mean, they didn't need to do this and the fact that they're doing it, this speak volumes.
3461680	3468120	I kind of wish that Sony would fucking do something like anything, just, you can't tell
3468120	3469120	me.
3469120	3472460	And I mean, I know that they are, they're trying to resell their PlayStation one stuff
3472460	3475520	like through, they have their own kind of inbuilt emulator stuff.
3475520	3477900	So like I got in like twisted male black and stuff like that.
3477900	3483260	And I guess that's PlayStation two, but, um, we've already seen the PlayStation two stuff
3483260	3485020	up on their story, right?
3485020	3487720	So they can do it, but it's just, they don't want to open it up.
3487720	3491180	So they, Oh, you have a copy of twisted male black that it'll play just fine.
3491180	3493060	Yeah, no, they don't want to do that.
3493060	3495420	Uh, looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com.
3495420	3500980	Rama says, fuck yes, conquer, uh, active says, Panzer Dragoon, or to finally, uh, Ray
3500980	3505660	engineer says, say, Rob, Loki question, are the downloadable X-Box originals only compatible
3505660	3507820	with certain models of the three 60.
3507820	3511860	I bought three when I had my first three 60 and they worked then, but with my current
3511860	3517020	three 60, they won't launch, you mean the X-Box one, but no, I think three 60 because
3517020	3522180	you can play X-Box originals and X-Box three 60 remember the emulator and that kid, it
3522180	3523180	works just fine.
3523180	3525400	As long as you have the backwards compatibility data in there.
3525400	3527380	So you have to have like a hard drive in there.
3527380	3531220	So if you have an old like core system that does not have a hard drive, then you don't
3531220	3532420	have that.
3532420	3537220	But if you have, you know, a hard drive in, I think you required a 20 gig hard drive at
3537220	3538700	least to be able to do that stuff.
3538700	3539700	Yeah.
3539700	3542820	Um, cause you have to download the backwards compatibility data in order to do it.
3542820	3546300	But I think that they all should be compatible.
3546300	3547300	Yeah.
3547300	3551580	I haven't heard anything about different three 60 models being compatible, but you're right
3551580	3552580	on the hard drive thing.
3552580	3554180	The hard drive thing is the requirement there.
3554180	3557620	I would say if that still is not working for you, we're agent or you should probably
3557620	3561020	contact a Microsoft tech support and see what they can do.
3561020	3562020	Yeah.
3562020	3563020	Maybe it's a license transfer thing.
3563020	3565780	So just as a show on her mat, that's a very good thought there.
3565780	3568340	Rama says, tweet to X-Box about that.
3568340	3571900	Microsoft is pretty responsive on Twitter, but I would honestly just go direct to their
3571900	3576540	like help thing and submit a formal ticket that way and have them look into it if it
3576540	3577540	still won't work.
3577540	3579620	But yeah, uh, look at the hard drive thing.
3579620	3583220	Look at the license transfer thing that those could both be issues why that's not still
3583220	3584220	working.
3584220	3589820	Anyway, moving on to something that's a little bit rumors, but before I read rumors, I know,
3589820	3593620	but it's one of those things where I kind of look at it and go, does this sound plausible?
3593620	3594620	You know, I love that.
3594620	3596420	We need to play Fleetwood Mac during this.
3596420	3599340	Well, Fleetwood Mac, they kind of broke up.
3599340	3600340	Yeah.
3600340	3601340	They just fired Lindsey Bunkingham.
3601340	3602340	I know.
3602340	3606880	It's like right before they went on their big, like all reunion, all of us do to fuck
3606880	3608300	this up.
3608300	3610740	Stevie Nicks and Lindsey had to be in the same room together.
3610740	3612740	That's what, I guess that's it.
3613260	3617380	They did a bad strain of something and this is that.
3617380	3618380	All right.
3618380	3625060	Anyway, uh, no, they're aged now probably a bad strain of kombucha anyway.
3625060	3626060	That's so accurate.
3626060	3627060	All right.
3627060	3630740	Anyway, uh, this is a rumor regarding theme parks.
3630740	3634220	We all know that Nintendo super Nintendo world is a thing that's coming to the universal
3634220	3636140	studios theme parks pretty soon.
3636140	3641260	However, now, uh, one of the big news networks, ABC, I don't know if that's the ABC here in
3641260	3643300	the U S I'm imagine it must be not the Australia one.
3643300	3647860	I think it is the ABC here because it is about universal studios, Orlando, apparently a Pokemon
3647860	3650540	theme park is coming to universal studios, Orlando.
3650540	3655180	This is because of sources that talked to ABC saying that Pokemon park will be part
3655180	3662360	of the kids zone section universal right now, woody woodpecker and Barney are located there.
3662360	3667100	So I would imagine those guys are getting evicted in favor of Pokemon.
3667100	3669900	Uh, it sounds like Barney might be taken out back and shot.
3669900	3670900	That would be pretty great.
3670940	3674020	I think a lot of us that grew up in the nineties would appreciate that they're going to put
3674020	3675020	Barney down.
3675020	3677500	Are you excited to hear that?
3677500	3678500	Loki?
3678500	3683500	Um, you know, I hated Barney back when it was fun to hate Barney, but actually Barney's
3683500	3684500	not terrible.
3684500	3689820	So actually having the kids watch it, but, um, yeah, I really don't care.
3689820	3692220	Yeah, my kids are outgrown Barney anyways.
3692220	3696140	Anyway, originally there was going to be a Mario cart and donkey Kong roller coaster
3696140	3700820	here, but that is going to move and that will be on the universal 400 acres that they
3700840	3704060	just bought near Kirkman Avenue across the street.
3704060	3708520	That is going to be home to universal's fourth park and Nintendo is going to be part of that
3708520	3709520	park.
3709520	3713540	Nintendo holds the trademark for Pokemon that is going to be part of a plan to have Nintendo
3713540	3717100	at all the properties, kind of like Harry Potter.
3717100	3718100	So there you go.
3718100	3720340	I still haven't been to Harry Potter land either.
3720340	3722660	Oh girl, you got to go where you're down there.
3722660	3727220	I know, but I'm, I've got, I'm flying back on Tuesday so I can see where it out.
3727220	3728220	Okay.
3728260	3732100	So we are planning a trip at some point where like we drive down Friday, we go to universal
3732100	3736900	Saturday because miss Victoria from shaking and crying is there and she, she lives like
3736900	3738220	five minutes away from universal.
3738220	3740780	So not to give out her address, but she said it on the show.
3740780	3743460	So she lives like five minutes from universal so she can meet us there.
3743460	3744660	I know she will.
3744660	3749980	And any, any excuse for her to dress up, I'll have to find my, um, actually order my Slytherin
3749980	3754220	roads and then we'll drive back on Sunday and do the show or we'll do the show live
3754220	3755220	from the car.
3755220	3756220	Yeah.
3756220	3759460	Wouldn't be the worst thing we've done.
3759460	3760460	Live from I-5.
3760460	3761460	All right.
3761460	3762460	Anyway, I think that's the thing that has to happen.
3762460	3763460	Not the five.
3763460	3770220	We take the 99 more stops and, and the, um, the crab, why did I always forget the name
3770220	3771220	of it?
3771220	3772220	The cheese.
3772220	3773220	Oh, the Bravo farm.
3773220	3774300	Bravo cheese farm.
3774300	3775740	They have Bravo farms on I-5 now.
3775740	3776740	But I don't care.
3776740	3777740	You have to go the original.
3777740	3782020	Or anyway, same place where they have a Starbucks.
3782020	3784020	Dungeon buster says butter beer is tasty.
3784020	3785020	Heck yeah.
3785020	3788760	One of my buddies was at universal this weekend actually.
3788760	3790660	And I'm like, send me pictures that make me jealous.
3790660	3794540	So of course I get like the butter beer dessert thing from the Harry Potter restaurant and
3794540	3798100	I'm like, Oh, I'm so hateful.
3798100	3800780	Anyway, I think this is the thing we have to do to our soccer.
3800780	3804900	I have decided my birthday's coming up and yes, I'm going to Chicago, but my birthday,
3804900	3805900	I'm 40 this year.
3805900	3806900	God damn it.
3806900	3809060	I want to go to a theme park for my birthday.
3809060	3811340	Like after before.
3811340	3813620	All right.
3813620	3814620	We should make it happen.
3814620	3815620	I think so.
3815620	3816620	That's what I want.
3816620	3817620	You know what?
3817620	3820300	Well, speaking by the way, I need to bring this up at some point.
3820300	3826380	I'm actually glad I said the word birthday because we need to acknowledge that dark soccer's
3826380	3827500	birthday is Thursday.
3827500	3828500	Yes, it is.
3828500	3832180	So dark soccer is turning 29 all over again.
3832180	3833180	Just like Bobby Black Wolf.
3833180	3834180	No, I'm not.
3834180	3835180	No.
3835180	3841380	And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what I like being where I am and getting carded for number
3841380	3842380	one.
3842380	3844060	I got carded today buying Guinness.
3844060	3849160	Like yeah, my skin looks better than I did as a teenager.
3849160	3850760	People don't believe it's me.
3850760	3856540	So I'm fine with my illusion, but I'm glad that I'm not 29 for all the fucking bullshit
3856540	3858680	that happened in my twenties.
3858680	3860420	Life got better when I turned 30.
3860420	3861420	Oh yeah.
3861420	3862420	No, my thirties.
3862420	3864520	The older I get, the less of a fuck I give.
3864520	3867500	I'm actually welcoming 40 because my thirties have been way better than my twenties.
3867500	3869460	I can't believe you're still not 40.
3869460	3870460	It's coming up.
3870980	3873660	Well, I mean, remember this show has been around for 16 years.
3873660	3874660	Okay.
3874660	3876740	So when the show started, I was 24.
3876740	3881100	I just in the thing, and I'll go ahead and fucking say it, I'm going to be 42 and I don't
3881100	3882100	care.
3882100	3885500	Well, and because it is the answer to everything, I will be the answer to life, the universe
3885500	3886500	and everything.
3886500	3887500	That's right.
3887500	3888500	But the thing is, you know what?
3888500	3890980	Billy Mitchell's older than you are and he's got more drama.
3890980	3893340	But here's the thing about it.
3893340	3896980	I still like all the stuff I did in my twenties.
3896980	3898820	I still enjoy myself.
3898860	3903980	I don't fucking feel like I thought I would feel in my forties.
3903980	3907500	I've done things to improve my health.
3907500	3913200	You know, I've I mean, fuck, I've dropped 40 is the new 70.
3913200	3917180	I've dropped 76 pounds since October.
3917180	3923660	And I'm happy as long as I don't end up, you know, in the same situation my mother is in.
3923660	3925540	I think I'll be okay.
3925540	3928340	You know, my life is a success.
3928860	3929860	I have a great job.
3929860	3930860	I have a great husband.
3930860	3931860	I have a great cat.
3931860	3932860	I have wonderful friends.
3932860	3933860	And you have great friends.
3933860	3934860	Holla.
3934860	3935860	Right.
3935860	3942300	And I wish that for everyone to make it to the same point that I have and feel as I wouldn't
3942300	3946740	say successful because success is personal, but feel satisfied.
3946740	3950260	And I feel satisfied with my life and I would like for everyone to have that same feeling
3950260	3951260	of satisfaction.
3951260	3957340	But the only thing that I want on my birthday is to play more video games is a cupcake,
3957340	3964020	a carrot cake, carrot cake cupcake with no fucking raisins in it.
3964020	3969260	Raisins are the wire hangers of my soul.
3969260	3970260	Fuck that noise.
3970260	3971260	All right.
3971260	3973460	Well, I hope I hope you get that cupcake.
3973460	3974460	Thank you.
3974460	3975460	I would bake it if I baked.
3975460	3976460	But I don't.
3976460	3978980	I'm just going to say I don't I don't bake and I bake it for you.
3978980	3983760	So you know what you let me find a place with cupcakes.
3983760	3986780	We can go there together and I will buy you the fucking cake with no raisins.
3986780	3988700	And I think I'm going to go see you ready player one that night.
3988700	3990020	You should do it.
3990020	3991020	I deserve it.
3991020	3995440	Link in our chat over at live dot vog network dot com MXC says great to hear as someone
3995440	3996980	nearing 30.
3996980	3999500	Fifth Dream says I'm 44 in three weeks.
3999500	4001840	So you know, we got we got some 40 year olds.
4001840	4007000	Act Def says I've been listening to OLR since I was 24 and that was around 11 years ago.
4007000	4008000	Let's see.
4008000	4012820	SSJ 100 Matt in chat says Rob is going to turn into Sally O'Malley from the Saturday
4012820	4015020	Night Live skit when he turns 50.
4015020	4016740	Cuz I'm 50.
4016740	4019220	That was a great character at Molly Shannon.
4019220	4020420	I love it.
4020420	4021540	All right.
4021540	4025020	And then everybody in chat is complaining about raisins.
4025020	4028900	I don't see raisins are deceptive little motherfuckers.
4028900	4029900	I like raisins.
4029900	4031980	However, I will look.
4031980	4033960	I'm going to give the anti raisin crowd this.
4033960	4035580	I'm going to give them two things.
4035580	4038320	First off, craisins are superior in every way.
4038320	4040940	They are second occurrence.
4040940	4046220	Second off, I too get really pissed off when I'm like, is that a chocolate chip cookie?
4046220	4049420	And I bite into it and it's fucking oatmeal raisins, right?
4049420	4054840	Raisins are the assholes to sever raisins are the Trump of the cookie world.
4054840	4057460	I'm However, however, no, this is important.
4057460	4058460	This is important.
4058460	4059460	Let me finish.
4059460	4064060	Like I let you finish.
4064060	4067340	If you tell me it's an oatmeal raisin cookie up front.
4067340	4068380	And so I am prepared.
4068380	4072780	My palate is ready to like, okay, this is going to be a raisin thing.
4072780	4073780	And then I eat that.
4073780	4074780	I'm fine.
4074780	4075780	I'm fine.
4075780	4080580	Loki, you just don't put, just don't put raisins in baked goods.
4080580	4085080	You can have reasons by themselves or even, I guess it's fine if it's like in a brand
4085080	4089820	muffin or something like that, but like anything else, they should not be in there.
4089820	4090820	You know what?
4090820	4094600	What would be good in oatmeal cookies is currents.
4094600	4095600	Currents would be good or quick.
4095600	4102560	I've had craisin oatmeal cookies and those were delicious, but no raisins are terrible.
4102560	4105600	And the reason why I call them the Trump of the cookie world is because they're deceptive
4105600	4110280	lying assholes that are shriveled and need to not exist in my universe.
4110280	4114640	Fuck the assholes at the goddamn grocery store who put the chocolate chip bagels right next
4114640	4117880	to the raisin bagels.
4117880	4119480	That's like right next to each other.
4119480	4120480	It's like, dude.
4120480	4121480	Okay.
4121480	4122480	Here's the thing.
4122480	4123480	Now you, you, okay.
4123480	4124480	We are a video game show.
4124480	4125720	I promise we'll get back to video games.
4125720	4128160	However, this is important.
4128160	4131880	When it comes to bagels, chocolate chips and bagels.
4131880	4132880	Really?
4132880	4133880	Yes.
4133880	4134880	No, no, no.
4134880	4135880	Chocolate buns and everything.
4135880	4136880	No, no, no.
4136880	4138280	Raisins and bagels are superior.
4138280	4139280	Ew.
4139280	4140280	No.
4140280	4141280	That's disgusting.
4141280	4143200	Especially when it's cinnamon raisin.
4143200	4145080	Raisins are, I hate cinnamon raisin stuff.
4145080	4146080	You know what?
4146080	4147080	This is going to make me mad.
4147080	4148080	You know what?
4148080	4149080	You take the mayonnaise.
4149080	4150080	I'll take the cinnamon raisin.
4150080	4151080	Done.
4151080	4152080	You can have that fucking bagel chip.
4152080	4153720	Raisins and ketchup and yellow mustard.
4153960	4154960	All three in the same category.
4154960	4158240	You can have that mayo chop, that disgusting vile substance that's been all over Twitter
4158240	4159240	this week.
4159240	4160240	I don't like ketchup.
4160240	4161240	So that's going to be disgusting.
4161240	4162240	Mayo chop?
4162240	4163240	Yeah.
4163240	4164240	Heinz is making...
4164240	4165240	Heinz is making its base.
4165240	4167800	It's mayonnaise plus ketchup in a single bottle.
4167800	4168800	That's what it is.
4168800	4170400	Who makes his mayo and ketchup?
4170400	4171400	Kids do.
4171400	4172400	Europeans.
4172400	4173400	Belgians.
4173400	4176800	Like, that's my actual answer, actually.
4176800	4183480	Well, Belgians do the superior thing of using mayonnaise for fries, but I will tell you
4183480	4184480	this.
4184480	4186480	I'm going to go to Disneyland on that Monday.
4186480	4192600	I'm going to get a carrot cake churro, but their dipping sauce is cream cheese raisin,
4192600	4196560	and I am just going to take every bit of raisin out of that nastiness.
4196560	4201240	You should, without breaking eye contact with the person running the cart, pick up the little
4201240	4206880	dip that they give you, extend your hand over the trash and throw it in, and then turn around
4206880	4207880	and walk away.
4207880	4208880	It's not their fault.
4208880	4212040	I am not the, can I speak to your manager, bitch?
4212600	4213600	Are you sure?
4213600	4215600	Cause, girl.
4215600	4216600	No.
4216600	4220960	The, can I speak to your manager, bitch, is when I'm dealing with pure incompetence.
4220960	4224640	Not when it's something that's a policy they can't do shit about.
4224640	4225640	I'm allergic to raisins.
4225640	4227640	Can you please give me some without?
4227640	4228640	They don't, they're pre-done.
4228640	4229640	They're all like that.
4229640	4230640	Oh, yeah.
4230640	4233800	What if you said, oh my gosh, I'm allergic to raisins, and the Disney magic is being
4233800	4234800	ruined for me?
4234800	4236800	Like, they would find something anyway.
4236800	4239800	I demand magic!
4240560	4243560	Dungeon Busters, even Jamie's laughing.
4243560	4248880	Dungeon Buster chat over at live.fognetwork.com says, hey, this is still about gaming.
4248880	4251800	Remember the California raisins had their own video game?
4251800	4252800	Yes.
4252800	4253800	It was annoying too.
4253800	4254800	Okay.
4254800	4258000	I never played it because the California raisins kind of scared me when I was a kid.
4258000	4263240	Now, VidPower is saying that ketchup and mayo is fry sauce, but that is not entirely true
4263240	4268120	because I have had fry sauce that, yes, it did contain ketchup and mayo, but that's not
4268120	4270120	all that goes into proper fry sauce.
4270120	4273400	Thousand Island also has relish, right?
4273400	4275280	That's, Thousand Island isn't fry sauce either.
4275280	4276280	Oh.
4276280	4277280	I thought fry sauce was just ketchup and mayo.
4277280	4279560	I thought that really was just fry sauce.
4279560	4280960	Not where I'm from, no.
4280960	4281960	Oh, okay.
4281960	4282960	That's localized versions.
4282960	4283960	Anyway, we got to move on.
4283960	4285960	Hey, hey, we got more games, video games.
4285960	4288040	Dark Soccer, in fact, it's your turn, and you have-
4288040	4289600	A mouthful of food.
4289600	4291080	And Sega stuff though, right?
4291080	4293080	Give me a second.
4293080	4294080	Okay.
4294080	4295080	Quickly-
4295080	4296080	I thought I had a chance to take a bite.
4296080	4297080	Okay.
4298040	4300040	What's your favorite Sega game?
4300040	4301040	Quick, Logie.
4301040	4302040	Favorite Sega game?
4302040	4303040	Oh, my favorite Sega game?
4303040	4305480	I didn't really have a lot of Sega games.
4305480	4306800	I'd say probably-
4306800	4307800	Fancy Star Online.
4307800	4308800	Shadow Dancer.
4308800	4309800	All right.
4309800	4310800	That is a good game.
4310800	4315560	Actually, it wasn't Shadow Dancer.
4315560	4316920	That was on Genesis because that was-
4316920	4317920	It was Genesis.
4317920	4318920	Yeah.
4318920	4320880	I'm thinking Dreamcast for some reason.
4320880	4323080	My brain went right into Dreamcast games.
4323080	4324080	That's all right.
4325080	4328080	Well, that's obviously Power Stone or Power Stone 2.
4328080	4329080	Powerful.
4329080	4330080	That was a Capcom game.
4330080	4331080	Anyway, story.
4331080	4332080	All right.
4332080	4338080	So Sega has had mercy on those of us who love our Switches, especially those of us who didn't
4338080	4345080	pay for them, and we are going to be getting 15 titles under the new Sega Ages lineup.
4345080	4347080	Three were confirmed.
4347080	4353080	Studio M2 is doing these, so we are going to be getting, for these titles, it looks
4353080	4358080	like, if this thing wasn't completely out of order, I'd be able to tell everybody.
4363080	4372080	Fantasy Star, and I hope that it's as good as the Sega Ages 2800 ones, like what came
4372080	4376080	out on PS2, because I will be super happy, because I had to play that in Japanese with
4376080	4378080	a guide on that game.
4378080	4381080	Oh, they're doing Sonic the Hedgehog and Thunder Force 4.
4381080	4386080	It would be cool if they did do, like, the full, you know, upgrade package like they
4386080	4389080	did with the Sega Ages 2800, but we'll see.
4389080	4392080	But it'd be nice for a lot of people who had never gotten to play the original Fantasy
4392080	4395080	Star, you know, which was a Sega Master System game.
4395080	4396080	It'd be really great.
4396080	4398080	And Thunder Force 4, I mean, that ain't, that ain't crap.
4398080	4400080	So, pretty good.
4400080	4403080	Hopefully we'll get a list of what the other ones are.
4403080	4407080	Isn't it weird, though, yet again, we just had the SNK thing last week.
4407080	4408080	Not that I'm complaining, mind you.
4408080	4410080	This is not a complaint.
4410080	4413080	However, it is a little weird to me that we had that last week, and now we have this,
4413080	4415080	and it's like, wait a minute.
4415080	4418080	Aren't these companies supposed to be saving this stuff for Virtual Console?
4418080	4424080	Like, so Virtual Console is clearly something the third, well, Virtual Console is not Virtual
4424080	4425080	Console anymore.
4425080	4426080	We're not having a Virtual Console anymore.
4426080	4428080	There is no Virtual Console.
4428080	4431080	Whatever Nintendo is planning for the retro stuff is something new, and it's something
4431080	4433080	for them, where third parties aren't allowed.
4433080	4434080	Yeah.
4434080	4435080	It is what it is.
4435080	4437080	That's where we're at right now.
4437080	4442080	Well, in other news, though, and I don't know how to feel about this, but Sega, for
4442080	4450080	the 30th anniversary of the Mega Drive, or as we had at the Genesis, they're doing a
4450080	4457080	Mega Drive Mini, and it looks like, I had the list, I thought I had the list of games
4457080	4463080	on here, but they're going to be doing a good number of games on it, except it's not going
4463080	4468080	to be, though, built by Sega, because Sega doesn't actually do any of their own console
4468080	4469080	stuff anymore.
4469080	4471080	I'm a little bit worried.
4471080	4476080	I had the list of the company that was doing this, like AT something, and I don't know
4476080	4482080	what their track record is, so, but all the Nintendo stuff was done in-house, so I'm just
4482080	4485080	a little bit, a little bit leery.
4485080	4487080	I'll wait and see.
4487080	4491080	I'd really want to see how the emulation is on them, because the Nintendo ones were perfect.
4491080	4496080	Well, clearly this is happening because of the success of the NES, but the thing is,
4496080	4499080	those Genesis flashback things have been around forever.
4499080	4500080	What's going to make this special?
4500080	4502080	Well, and the earlier ones were really terrible.
4502080	4504080	Their emulation was absolute garbage.
4504080	4508080	You know, they really are going to have to make this something else.
4508080	4514080	Yeah, but for Sega, because they kind of licensed this out to sub parties before, I think they're
4514080	4517080	really going to have to step it up with this to be impressive.
4517080	4519080	They're going to have to step their pussies up.
4519080	4520080	That's right.
4520080	4523080	Alright, just a couple more stories before we get to a real classic game of the week
4523080	4524080	here in a moment.
4524080	4525080	Loki.
4525080	4527080	Alright, so this is kind of interesting.
4527080	4531080	So, it's always going to take, like, hackers to add that, you know, additional feature
4531080	4534080	that we really wish was there.
4534080	4543080	So apparently, someone had to exploit a flaw in the Switch to add save backups to the Switch,
4543080	4545080	which is kind of interesting.
4545080	4554080	And so, basically, the guy, he rewrote Checkpoint to work with the Switch and using its user
4554080	4559080	interface and everything, and they actually have, like, some screenshots of backing up
4559080	4562080	saves to work with the Switch hardware.
4562080	4564080	It's kind of interesting.
4564080	4572080	They said previously, you know, the 3DS and Wii U are cracked enough to suffer piracy
4572080	4578080	problems, but, you know, the Switch has not really had that issue yet, so they've kind
4578080	4579080	of avoided that.
4579080	4585080	But really, yeah, they should just add basic features to their, you know, console, because
4585080	4590080	it would be nice to be able to back the stuff up, or at least cloud saves might be nice.
4590080	4594080	I mean, I guess I understand, you know, you're not expected to have multiple systems, but
4594080	4597080	if the system dies, all your stuff's there.
4597080	4601080	Well, maybe when they start charging people for online, cloud saves is one of those things
4601080	4605080	that could kind of be, you know, part of the reason why they're charging money for it.
4605080	4606080	That would be cool.
4606080	4607080	Or at least just allowing you to back it up would be nice.
4607080	4609080	Yeah, for sure.
4609080	4614080	But, when you can't do what you want with your hardware, hackers gonna hack, right?
4614080	4615080	Right.
4615080	4620080	All right, and when you do things you're not supposed to be doing, when the government
4620080	4623080	has passed rules about it, they will sometimes fine you and slap you on the wrist.
4623080	4626080	And that's what's happening in South Korea.
4626080	4633080	The South Korean Fair Trade Commission fined three game publishers over misleading odds
4633080	4634080	for loot boxes in the games.
4634080	4638080	See, so even though they have that kind of regulation, they're just gonna exploit it
4638080	4640080	because the fine's less than the money they're gonna make.
4640080	4644080	But now they've been called out, and that's pretty bad when the government has to come
4644080	4645080	in and do that.
4645080	4650080	Netmarble, Nextfloor, and Nexon, which they do games here.
4650080	4652080	The Nexon does a lot of stuff.
4652080	4655080	They are huge for free-to-play games over in Asia.
4655080	4659080	They are being penalized because they have violated the Electronic Commerce Act.
4659080	4664080	This all according to the Korean Herald that said that they all took issue with the way
4664080	4668080	that these three companies were advertising odds of loot boxes in their games.
4668080	4671080	One example was a game called Celebrity Count.
4671080	4674080	Oh no, the Celebrity Count event in Sudden Attack.
4674080	4678080	Nexon's ads showed that anyone who bought a loot box had a chance to get a puzzle piece,
4678080	4682080	and then on collecting all 16 pieces, players would get an in-game benefit.
4682080	4686080	But the odds of actually receiving a puzzle piece was as low as 0.5%,
4686080	4689080	and that was something Nexon did not disclose.
4689080	4697080	So Nexon got an $882,700 penalty and then fined for $5,200.
4697080	4700080	This is the largest of all the three publishers that I mentioned.
4700080	4706080	The publisher said that they used the phrase random provision to suggest that odds would be different.
4706080	4709080	They disagreed with the FTC's interpretation.
4709080	4713080	You know what? I'm glad the government slapped him in the face then,
4713080	4717080	because don't fucking dance around with this fucking vocabulary.
4717080	4723080	You know what, Nexon? Suck it up and publish the actual odds or not get the fuck off,
4723080	4727080	which I know you're not going to do because these free-to-play games are everywhere in Asia.
4727080	4735080	So anyway, Netmarble made a game called Marvel Future Fight and Star Wars Force Arena,
4735080	4741080	and then Destiny Child, not to be confused with the band of the same name that reunited last night,
4741080	4747080	Next Floor makes this game. They were hit with a much smaller fine, just $4,700.
4747080	4751080	Netmarble, they did reveal the odds, but they weren't accurate.
4751080	4753080	That's kind of interesting, so...
4753080	4755080	I mean, they lied. Lies!
4755080	4758080	Yeah, yeah. So, Liza Minnelli lies.
4758080	4761080	So, interesting to see how this loot box stuff is all going.
4761080	4763080	You know, it didn't make the show roll tonight,
4763080	4771080	but I remember seeing a story about how EA is kind of seeing how they're being perceived out there by the mass market.
4771080	4775080	I'm going to be very curious to see what EA's games looked like this holiday, after last holiday.
4775080	4777080	I know you're not convinced, Loki.
4777080	4778080	Yeah.
4778080	4780080	But I think EA's kind of come out and said,
4780080	4782080	okay, we realize people don't like us.
4782080	4784080	Like, that was the sense I was getting.
4784080	4787080	They realize that this year we haven't liked them for several years.
4787080	4790080	Well, but this year is when they really felt it in the pocketbook.
4790080	4796080	Okay, yeah. I'm sure this year they'll totally see light and totally change.
4796080	4799080	It's not going to be just nothing ever again.
4799080	4801080	I don't know. I don't trust them at all.
4801080	4807080	Alright. Well, let's travel back to a simpler time when there was no loot boxes.
4807080	4810080	You know what? You could type in a code in the cartridge.
4810080	4813080	They had loot boxes. They were the grab bags at Sanrio.
4813080	4817080	That's right. It's the classic game of the week
4817080	4819080	where Dark Soccer's going to step into the gaming vault
4819080	4824080	and find a game that she thinks, hey, you brats, you should check this game out.
4824080	4826080	This one might be a hard one, right?
4826080	4828080	This is an import-only game you picked this week, right?
4828080	4832080	It is, and it has the distinction of being the first game I ever imported
4832080	4837080	when I lived in Alabama, and I paid $120 for this fucker COD.
4837080	4839080	Wow. Okay. That's pretty impressive.
4839080	4841080	So there's your Notability tonight.
4841080	4843080	It's the first game Jamie ever imported.
4843080	4844080	Yes.
4844080	4845080	Alright, what is the classic game of the week?
4845080	4850080	Shoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S Joe Gairanto Shakyusou Satsuden.
4850080	4852080	Sousatsu-sen. Sorry, not Satsuden.
4852080	4855080	Okay, I recognize two words in there. Sailor Moon.
4855080	4856080	Yes.
4856080	4859080	So this is the Sailor Moon S game.
4859080	4864080	It was a fighting game that came out on Super Famicom done by Angel Studios in 1994.
4864080	4870080	I imported my copy probably just after I graduated high school.
4871080	4873080	It is a fighting game.
4873080	4878080	It has all of the inner and outer Senshi except for Sailor Saturn.
4878080	4882080	It also has Chibi Moon's Flying Butt Attack,
4882080	4886080	which basically we would just play Chibi Moon the whole time and do the Flying Butt Attack.
4886080	4889080	You have four different modes.
4889080	4893080	You have a practice mode where you can practice the attacks for no damage.
4893080	4899080	You have tournament mode, which is an eight-character fight for a knockout tournament,
4899080	4904080	one to eight players being human and the others being CPU characters.
4904080	4907080	You have versus mode where you just fight one-on-one, standard versus.
4907080	4914080	And you have story mode where it's the Sailor Senshi fighting to choose a new leader.
4914080	4919080	In this mode, the inner Senshi and Sailor Chibi Moon are all playable.
4919080	4923080	You have to defeat the other eight normally playable Senshi to win.
4923080	4926080	And if you succeed, then the title screen changes
4926080	4929080	so that the silhouette that's on the top pillar
4929080	4933080	you know the intro for Sailor Moon where the top pillar has Sailor Moon on it
4933080	4939080	would be the one who wins and then Tuxedo Kamen shows up on the continue screen if you lose.
4939080	4942080	There are different stages in it.
4942080	4945080	There is the Hikawa Shrine for Sailor Mars,
4945080	4948080	the Jubun Shopping District for Sailor Jupiter,
4948080	4950080	the Time Space Door for Pluto,
4950080	4952080	Moon Castle for Sailor Moon,
4952080	4955080	the Water Fountain at the park during the day for Sailor Mercury,
4955080	4958080	and the one at night for Sailor Uranus,
4958080	4960080	Seaside Port for Sailor Neptune,
4960080	4963080	Crystal Tokyo during the day for Chibi Moon,
4963080	4965080	Crystal Tokyo at night for Sailor Venus,
4965080	4968080	and then there is a hidden stage that's inside of an office building.
4968080	4972080	And the workers get up from their cubicles and cheer you on.
4972080	4978080	I like this game a lot because I had just gotten into the real Sailor Moon,
4978080	4981080	not the dubs that we got over here,
4981080	4984080	but I started getting fan subs and watching them.
4984080	4987080	So it was really fun for me.
4987080	4990080	This music here that we're hearing in the background,
4990080	4992080	this is background music from the show.
4995080	4997080	Just little background scene music.
4997080	5001080	The intro is the Sailor Moon intro.
5003080	5007080	See? It even has all of the little phrases and everything.
5007080	5010080	It just really makes me happy.
5010080	5013080	One thing I did know is that the sprites in this game
5013080	5016080	were actually recycled from the Sailor Moon R game developed by Bondai.
5016080	5022080	They just retouched from the first game that Angel actually did.
5022080	5025080	So it's a little bit of recycling and rehashing,
5025080	5027080	but the game I thought was fun.
5027080	5029080	I always wish I had gotten the Super's game
5029080	5031080	because it was a little bit more robust,
5031080	5034080	and you could play as Saturn as well, but oh well.
5034080	5036080	This is what I had access to,
5036080	5038080	and I broke a game genie so I could play this game
5038080	5041080	before I realized you could just cut the tabs out inside the machine.
5041080	5045080	So there you go. 1994 in all of its glory.
5045080	5047080	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5047080	5049080	The Sailor Moon fighting game.
5049080	5051080	Sailor Moon S fighting game.
5051080	5053080	Which by the way, I do notice in our chat,
5053080	5057080	VidPower says they're actually having a mini side tournament
5057080	5060080	for the Super Nintendo Sailor Moon game at EVO this year.
5060080	5063080	Which Sailor Moon game though? There were several fighting games.
5063080	5064080	This one.
5064080	5066080	This one? Huh, fun.
5066080	5068080	I'm surprised it's not the Super's one,
5068080	5070080	because that one is a newer game.
5070080	5071080	It came out in 96.
5071080	5073080	Wait, let me look at the official tweet.
5073080	5075080	Just to make sure we don't have any confusion going on.
5075080	5077080	I'm going to leave the official tweet.
5077080	5079080	And there's the little...
5081080	5083080	I think this is it?
5083080	5086080	I don't know, there's all these logos here I can't see.
5086080	5088080	Oh yeah, there it is. The Sailor Moon S right there at the bottom.
5088080	5090080	Okay. Interesting.
5090080	5093080	It's not a bad game, I just think the Super's one is better.
5093080	5095080	Alright, we're going to take a quick break,
5095080	5097080	but don't go anywhere because we've got more Orange Lounge Radio to come,
5097080	5099080	including rapid fire news.
5099080	5101080	We've got the mailbag tonight.
5101080	5104080	We also have your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
5104080	5108080	All when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5114080	5117080	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5117080	5120080	Live on Sunday, April the 15th, 2018,
5120080	5124080	with episode 726 of our show already in progress
5124080	5127080	with myself, DarkSakura, and Loki all here in studio.
5127080	5129080	And some of you guys in our chat room,
5129080	5131080	those of you that are a little more techy at things
5131080	5133080	and know how to get in some other ways,
5133080	5137080	unfortunately our main chat applet at live.vognetwork.com
5137080	5140080	ain't working, but I've seen some alternative ideas in our Discord,
5140080	5144080	and also I retweeted one sent to us by Anime Jam Session.
5144080	5147080	I guess their chat applet's a little different and is letting people in,
5147080	5149080	so you have some other ideas if you want to get in and say hello
5149080	5151080	and chat with us here on the show tonight.
5151080	5156080	So I have to say, so one of our pals here at Orange Lounge Radio,
5156080	5158080	JD, who hasn't been on the show in a little while,
5158080	5160080	but he's going to be, he's visiting in I think two weeks.
5160080	5162080	So he'll be here, but he's tweeting right now.
5162080	5166080	He is at a DDR drag show right now.
5166080	5169080	And so, and I think I remember seeing ads for this.
5169080	5171080	It's some of the, one of the gals from Dragula,
5171080	5173080	which kind of like, it's not Drag Race,
5173080	5178080	but it's like the monster drag, is doing like a DDR rock show themed thing.
5178080	5180080	Even Loki, I could show this to you.
5180080	5182080	Look at this, look at this. This is one of them.
5182080	5185080	She's dressed up right now as like that robot character from DDR.
5185080	5186080	That's pretty rad, right?
5186080	5187080	Yeah.
5187080	5188080	So that's, that's super.
5188080	5189080	Zukin?
5189080	5190080	Yeah, Zukin, that's it.
5190080	5194080	And then this one's, one of these other gals is dressed up as Storm,
5194080	5196080	but she's throwing Starburst to cartoon heroes.
5196080	5197080	Remember?
5197080	5198080	Drag is art.
5198080	5201080	That's right. This is art. Art, people.
5201080	5203080	Who likes art? Art, art.
5203080	5206080	Speaking of DDR, I didn't mention it during my gaming week,
5206080	5209080	but I'll mention it now since that whole DDR drag queen made me think of it.
5209080	5213080	I got to play a DDR third mix Korean this weekend
5213080	5216080	because I quickly dropped in and visit Mel B
5216080	5218080	and they have the machine in their garage.
5218080	5220080	So I got to play that.
5220080	5222080	It was funny because I tweeted it and somebody was like,
5222080	5224080	oh, did you finally go visit Loki's machine?
5224080	5226080	I'm like, no, this is the third mix Korean.
5226080	5231080	Well, yeah, I have to get, they have a DVD drive you can get for it
5231080	5233080	because it normally has a CD drive.
5233080	5237080	And then there's a universal bootleg thing that you can get that basically
5237080	5240080	it's 10 mixes you can swap in and out.
5240080	5244080	So they have third, it's everything up through extreme.
5244080	5248080	So they have like dancing stage, Euro mix and stuff like that.
5248080	5250080	Disney's rave that you can put on there.
5250080	5253080	I would want a fourth plus.
5253080	5255080	That would be the one I want.
5255080	5258080	I kind of, you guys, I really want a DDR machine.
5258080	5261080	I think I need to get one. I really do.
5261080	5265080	So borrow a couple of our pinballs so we can have room for DDR.
5265080	5268080	I kind of want a fourth mix plus more than anything right now.
5268080	5271080	We've actually got to clear out room because Dan's Mustang is coming home.
5271080	5276080	Whatever you get, you can always change it out really easy.
5276080	5277080	Yeah, that's true. That's true.
5277080	5279080	So I think that's what they did too.
5279080	5282080	I think it was an extreme and they changed it to a third Korean.
5282080	5286080	I need to get, I keep looking at my marquee because my marquee is bootleg as fuck.
5286080	5288080	I need to get a new marquee.
5288080	5291080	You can have an official second mix.
5292080	5295080	No, I don't want to take our marquee.
5295080	5298080	No, I need to actually get something for mine.
5298080	5300080	But look, it has a little Konami sticker.
5300080	5302080	It's official.
5302080	5304080	You know what I have at home, right?
5304080	5306080	I have the second mixed up book.
5306080	5309080	Oh yeah, because of the Dreamcast version, right?
5309080	5312080	No, it's the arcade book.
5312080	5314080	Oh, that's cool. I thought it came with something.
5314080	5316080	No, it's actually a strategy guide.
5316080	5318080	A Japanese strategy guide.
5318080	5321080	Gotcha. Anyway, cool.
5321080	5323080	So yeah, I got to play that a little bit.
5323080	5325080	And that was fun because I got to play Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick,
5325080	5329080	which I don't think I've played on a machine in like five years easy at least.
5329080	5331080	So that was fun.
5331080	5333080	So DDR memories, good times.
5333080	5337080	I would only want third Korean just for Stump to my beat, but you know.
5337080	5339080	Here's my problem is that we still rent this house.
5339080	5343080	So like if I get a DDR machine, that machine is going to have to be moved at some point.
5343080	5345080	And that's going to be a terror.
5345080	5346080	You know what I mean?
5347080	5350080	It's not as hard moving it as you would think.
5350080	5352080	They're all in casters.
5352080	5356080	Having done that, it only takes a couple.
5356080	5358080	As a DDR machine owner.
5358080	5362080	Yes, having much recently moved the DDR machine,
5362080	5366080	it's actually not as hard as you would think.
5366080	5369080	But it does take up a lot of space, so that is true.
5369080	5373080	Let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki.
5373080	5377080	So apparently Ikaruga is going to be coming to the Switch.
5377080	5382080	Or at least that seems to be the case because of a picture that was tweeted out.
5382080	5384080	And it looks pretty awesome.
5384080	5387080	So Treasure did tweet that out.
5387080	5393080	And on top of that, they also showed that it looks like it may have a vertical mode option as well.
5393080	5398080	Because the screenshot shows kind of it running both in horizontal and vertical.
5398080	5400080	So neat.
5400080	5402080	Ikaruga and all the platforms.
5402080	5405080	I'm glad they're doing vertical for Ikaruga.
5405080	5409080	I had said this on OLR. Why aren't they doing more shooters with vertical mode?
5409080	5411080	And I think vertical mode is good.
5411080	5415080	That other pinball, not pinball FX3, but the stern pinball, just got vertical mode.
5415080	5421080	The only problem with vertical mode on that is just that how do you set the screen up.
5421080	5425080	Because it's kind of awkward. You kind of have to balance it against something.
5425080	5427080	The kickstand doesn't do that.
5427080	5431080	You take off the left controller and you just use the right controller.
5431080	5436080	You don't stand it up. You just hold it in your hand and it's the right amount of counterbalance.
5436080	5439080	Because you're holding it in your hand with the right controller and it doesn't bend or anything.
5439080	5441080	It's fine.
5441080	5444080	I've played some of the pinball FX. It works.
5444080	5450080	I think I've seen something that was mocked up where it's basically a holder for the system.
5450080	5453080	But it's vertical and then you put the controllers on the side.
5453080	5457080	Kind of like a controller dock but it has enough tension to hold the screen in there.
5457080	5459080	Kind of cool.
5459080	5464080	I'm sure there's something you could rig up to to hold the machine, the little thing, safely in a vertical position.
5464080	5467080	And then you could use a pro controller or something.
5467080	5469080	It's still neat to have the option.
5469080	5471080	Yeah, it's neat to have the option.
5471080	5474080	If you play with the controller thing in the bottom, it works really well.
5474080	5477080	I really like playing pinball FX that way.
5477080	5483080	Alright, and then there's this cool game called Duck Jam, which is on itch.io.
5483080	5489080	And it's a free WarioWare type game featuring ducks.
5489080	5494080	And it definitely takes a lot of inspiration from different Nintendo games.
5494080	5498080	Because they've got an overworld map that looks like it's out of Super Mario World.
5498080	5504080	And I know there's some other things in there that very much look like WarioWare.
5504080	5506080	But go check it out.
5506080	5508080	You'll find it at...
5508080	5511080	Looks like Boon.itch.io.
5511080	5519080	So that's Boon with B-O-O-O-N dot itch dot I-O slash duck dash jam.
5519080	5521080	And you can check it out.
5521080	5522080	And it's pretty awesome.
5522080	5525080	They've got a bunch of little mini games that increasingly get harder.
5525080	5527080	And all sorts of silly stuff in there.
5527080	5530080	So they have one where a duck's eating a piece of bread.
5530080	5532080	They have one that's like Flappy Bird.
5532080	5534080	They have one that's a dating sim.
5534080	5537080	So just go check it out. It looks silly and it's free.
5537080	5539080	And check out Super Multitasking.
5539080	5542080	Even though you have to pay for that one, you know what? It's worth it.
5542080	5547080	So I know the launch glow has died down a little bit.
5547080	5550080	And so it's probably having a hard time getting some more exposure.
5550080	5553080	So let me remind you, if you haven't picked up Super Multitasking on Steam,
5553080	5555080	our buddy YYR did a great job.
5555080	5558080	If you like these WarioWare type of games, do it.
5558080	5561080	Anyhow, I have some stories for you guys as well.
5561080	5564080	We're going to start with a story about the Mega Man X Collection.
5564080	5565080	Who's excited about this?
5565080	5568080	There's Mega Man X Legacy 1 and 2.
5568080	5571080	It is coming to the Nintendo Switch on July 24th.
5571080	5574080	Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 and 2.
5574080	5576080	America and Europe on July 24th.
5576080	5577080	You know the only thing about these games?
5577080	5580080	I feel like nowadays I'm not very good to play with them.
5580080	5583080	It's almost like one of these games it'd be like I'd rent it
5583080	5587080	and then I would use the Game Genie to kind of cheese my way through it.
5587080	5590080	Here's your chance to do it without cheating.
5590080	5592080	I do want to state before someone corrects me,
5592080	5595080	it is also on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but come on.
5595080	5598080	I know I'm getting it on the Switch so I can have the, you know,
5598080	5600080	this isn't a game that needs the most amped up systems
5600080	5603080	so it'd be nice to have it portable and on the TV.
5603080	5604080	So that's pretty cool.
5604080	5606080	But they are, I guess they are separate games.
5606080	5610080	So they're 1 and 2, but I think the disc release is probably the combo.
5610080	5613080	But if you buy the thing online, you buy them piecemeal.
5613080	5617080	But if you're wondering, just so you know,
5617080	5624080	the Mega Man X3 in the collection is the Super Nintendo version of the game.
5624080	5627080	So it is not the PlayStation version.
5627080	5631080	Yeah, but even the versions that came out on PlayStation and Saturn
5631080	5635080	were just the Super Nintendo ones anyway with a big frame around it,
5635080	5636080	so it doesn't matter.
5636080	5638080	Yeah, so just to be clear what you're buying,
5638080	5640080	you're getting the Super Nintendo version.
5640080	5643080	Also, these were developed internally at Capcom,
5643080	5647080	not through Digital Eclipse who did the previous collections.
5647080	5650080	I guess Capcom saw that these things were selling pretty well
5650080	5653080	and wanted to bring that in house, so there you go.
5653080	5657080	Also, Warcraft 3 is getting a patch.
5657080	5659080	That's right, Warcraft 3.
5659080	5660080	Another one?
5660080	5661080	Yeah.
5661080	5662080	I did a story on this a few months ago.
5662080	5663080	Well, here's the thing.
5663080	5666080	When you did the story, it was that the patch was being developed.
5666080	5668080	Now the patch is out.
5668080	5671080	So this is the biggest patch that the game has gotten in a long time.
5671080	5674080	It's version 1.29.
5674080	5676080	They are saying this is the biggest patch in over 10 years.
5676080	5678080	You know one thing it includes?
5678080	5682080	You know what you have in Warcraft 3 now that you didn't have before?
5682080	5686080	Widescreen monitor support is now in Warcraft 3.
5686080	5687080	It's about time.
5687080	5689080	But that's awesome.
5689080	5692080	I mean, the fact that this game is so old, but now it's kind of modernized.
5692080	5696080	Widescreen monitors are commonplace now, so that's really cool.
5696080	5698080	So there is no stretching.
5698080	5702080	There are bookends in the in-game interface and black pillars in the menus.
5702080	5705080	So that way I guess you don't lose, you know.
5705080	5707080	It's not all stretchy and weird things like that.
5707080	5710080	Also in lobbies, 24 players now.
5710080	5714080	12 new team colors, including Maroon, Navy, Turquoise, and others.
5714080	5716080	A reset in ladder standings.
5716080	5718080	Automated tournaments will resume next week.
5718080	5722080	This will be the last version to support Windows XP.
5722080	5723080	Sniff.
5723080	5726080	My fave, y'all.
5726080	5727080	My fave.
5728080	5730080	The map pool has been updated.
5730080	5734080	This means there is an object limit increase up to 30,000,
5734080	5738080	and a map size limit at 480 by 480, and a tile slot limit at 16.
5738080	5741080	So assuming with the beefier computers we have these days,
5741080	5742080	now they can do some better maps.
5742080	5746080	Some folks thinking this is leading to a potential Warcraft remaster,
5746080	5749080	just like we had the Starcraft remaster.
5749080	5750080	Who knows?
5750080	5752080	I think that would be really awesome, actually.
5752080	5753080	I might even check that out.
5753080	5754080	I don't...
5754080	5756080	Gaming's a shocking secret.
5756080	5758080	I don't own Warcraft 3, and I never have.
5758080	5762080	I own Warcraft 1 and 2, and I own World of Warcraft,
5762080	5764080	but Warcraft 3 kind of came out during a time
5764080	5766080	when I wasn't really playing as many games.
5766080	5768080	Or if I was playing games, I was probably playing Diablo.
5768080	5770080	If I was playing anything Blizzard, I was probably playing that.
5770080	5772080	Diablo or Diablo 2.
5772080	5773080	Never got around to that.
5773080	5777080	Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?
5777080	5782080	Well, an announcement was made that Shenmue 1 and 2
5782080	5787080	is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC through Steam.
5787080	5791080	They announced it at SEGA Fest 2018,
5791080	5796080	and it looks like it's going to be released for $29.99.
5796080	5799080	But in Japan, it's only going to be on PlayStation 4.
5799080	5801080	So, yay.
5801080	5804080	When's Shenmue 3 again?
5804080	5811080	And then last but not least, they announced a new Sakura Taisen or Sakura Wars.
5811080	5815080	They don't say what it's going to be on,
5815080	5823080	but it will be set in Taisho-era Tokyo around 1929.
5823080	5830080	And this is the last time I think a Sakura Taisen game came out.
5830080	5839080	It was in 2010, but that was a re-release of the 2005 Sakura Taisen,
5839080	5840080	so long, my love.
5840080	5842080	So, yay.
5842080	5844080	Another Sakura Taisen.
5844080	5845080	What will it be on?
5845080	5847080	We don't know.
5847080	5849080	All the systems.
5849080	5850080	All right.
5850080	5851080	Fifth Dream in chat says,
5851080	5854080	I've been waiting for this news ever since Shenmue 3 was announced.
5854080	5857080	I've never played 2, and I want to play them both before 3.
5857080	5860080	So, this will be a good way to get caught up for a lot of people.
5860080	5861080	I think I'm going to check it out.
5861080	5862080	That's for sure.
5862080	5864080	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates,
5864080	5867080	and then we'll get to the mailbag right after that.
5867080	5869080	But first, in the U.S., Loki.
5869080	5871080	We've got Ys VIII.
5871080	5874080	It looks like a Lacrimosa of Dona.
5874080	5876080	Another freaking Ys game.
5876080	5877080	Yes, that's on PC.
5877080	5878080	Ys.
5878080	5879080	Ys.
5879080	5880080	Ys.
5880080	5882080	Wild Guns Reloaded on Nintendo Switch.
5882080	5884080	At least I didn't say Ys.
5884080	5886080	I would have had to throw my phone at you.
5886080	5890080	Yakuza 6, The Song of Life on PlayStation 4.
5890080	5895080	Metal Max Xeno on PlayStation 4 and the Vita.
5895080	5898080	God of War on PlayStation 4 this week.
5898080	5901080	And then, of course, if you have a Switch and you're feeling a little crafty,
5901080	5906080	Nintendo Labo, the variety kit and the robot kit are out this week as well.
5906080	5909080	And I believe that's it.
5909080	5912080	You know, we haven't talked a lot about God of War this week,
5912080	5916080	but I know the reviews for that have been very, very good,
5916080	5917080	and people are really excited.
5917080	5919080	So, it's coming out this next week.
5919080	5920080	It didn't come out.
5920080	5921080	I thought it came out last week.
5921080	5922080	No, it's coming out this week.
5922080	5924080	Okay, so it must have been just all the press came out this last week,
5924080	5926080	so they knew they had a good game on their hands.
5926080	5929080	So, I have to admit, though, I'm not super into the God of War series.
5929080	5930080	I never have been.
5930080	5932080	So, I don't know if this is something that screams at me.
5932080	5935080	I was interested in the older God of War games.
5935080	5937080	This one, I don't really, nah.
5937080	5940080	It was interesting, though, one of the reviews I was glancing at on it
5940080	5944080	said something interesting about how the violence has been,
5944080	5946080	like, it's not that the game's not violent,
5946080	5952080	but that maybe now we're looking at the ramifications of all that violence
5952080	5954080	kind of plays out in this game.
5954080	5955080	I find that very fascinating,
5955080	5959080	very kind of like self-referential sort of thing for the series,
5959080	5960080	you know what I mean?
5960080	5963080	So, I'm looking forward to seeing how that plays out.
5963080	5965080	All right, let's go over to Japan
5965080	5966080	and check out what's coming out over there,
5966080	5970080	including Metal Max Xeno is also out in a regular limited edition
5970080	5972080	on PlayStation 4 in Japan this week.
5972080	5974080	Gravel is also out there as well,
5974080	5978080	and a price reduction, if you want, on Digimon World Next Order.
5978080	5980080	So, maybe Dark Soccer wants to import that. I don't know.
5980080	5981080	No.
5981080	5985080	Man Shima TT Race Ride on the Edge is also out this week,
5985080	5988080	and God of War also out on Japan on the 20th,
5988080	5990080	the same day it is out apparently everywhere else.
5990080	5991080	There it is.
5991080	5994080	Let's see, also on the Vita, that Metal Max Xeno
5994080	5996080	also getting released on the Vita
5996080	5999080	because the Vita still gets a lot of games in Japan.
5999080	6000080	And then on the Switch this week,
6000080	6003080	that Nintendo Labo also making its way to Japan.
6003080	6006080	Same kits we have here, the variety kit and the robot kit.
6006080	6010080	There is no extra stuff that Japan's getting that we're not.
6010080	6013080	But, Japan is also getting a game this week on the Switch.
6013080	6016080	Portal Knights and Wonder Boy the Dragon's Trap
6016080	6019080	is getting its Japanese release this week,
6019080	6021080	which, you know, that was a game we've had for a little bit now
6021080	6024080	where you can switch between the, speaking of Sega stuff,
6024080	6026080	you can switch between the regular and normal,
6026080	6030080	or the retro and the remastered modes with a button press.
6030080	6031080	It's pretty cool.
6031080	6034080	So, that will be fun to play for the Japanese audience
6034080	6035080	who hasn't seen that yet.
6035080	6036080	So, cool.
6036080	6038080	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
6038080	6040080	There are a few things.
6040080	6044080	Coming out on the 17th, we have Yakuza 6, the Song of Life.
6044080	6049080	God, stop asking me to send notifications.
6049080	6050080	Fine.
6050080	6052080	Sorry, it was harassing me.
6052080	6060080	We have the PS4 Pro 1TB God of War limited edition console on the 20th.
6061080	6065080	And then, of course, God of War, again, on the 20th
6065080	6069080	with all kinds of figurines and stuff, too.
6069080	6073080	Assetto Corsa Ultimate Edition on April 20th as well.
6073080	6075080	Don't Starve Megapack.
6075080	6078080	And that's it.
6078080	6081080	All right, we're going to get here to the emails.
6081080	6083080	Sorry for the distraction here in studio,
6083080	6087080	but JD is using Snapchat to send me snaps of the drag show he's at.
6087080	6089080	And so, there was just, I think that was Erica Clash
6089080	6093080	that was dancing on stage in a big butterfly outfit, too.
6093080	6094080	Dynamite rave?
6094080	6096080	Yeah, no, to a rock version of butterfly.
6096080	6097080	So, I'm living.
6097080	6098080	Oh, my God, I should have went.
6098080	6100080	I can't believe I didn't go to that.
6100080	6102080	Anyway, but I'm here with you guys.
6102080	6104080	You don't want to know what else I was doing.
6104080	6106080	I'm planning on Disneybounding.
6106080	6107080	Oh, for your trip?
6107080	6112080	And I'm looking, I found a tank top that looks like a Tron outfit.
6112080	6113080	Love it.
6113080	6116080	But it's got the lines, so I was going to do...
6116080	6119080	Quick story, because listeners may not know what Disney, Disneybonding?
6119080	6120080	Bound.
6120080	6121080	Disneybounding.
6121080	6122080	I don't know what Disneybonding is.
6122080	6123080	It's casual cosplay.
6123080	6127080	Yeah, it's like, because you can't wear costumes into the park unless you're a kid.
6127080	6130080	It's an outfit inspired by a Disney character or franchise.
6130080	6134080	So, you wear like a normal outfit, but that looks kind of,
6134080	6136080	like I saw one for Gaston.
6136080	6138080	That was when you were there with me.
6138080	6141080	The girl that was doing the Gaston tunic.
6141080	6142080	Yes.
6142080	6143080	Yeah, I've seen that, too.
6143080	6148080	Victoria posted hers the other day with the bell off the shoulder yellow outfit.
6148080	6151080	So that's a thing that people do now, is they wear outfits that kind of...
6151080	6155080	One of my favorites was a guy wearing a pinstripe black and green suit,
6155080	6158080	three piece suit, in front of the Haunted Mansion.
6158080	6159080	Nice.
6159080	6160080	Yep.
6160080	6161080	Alright.
6161080	6162080	Let's get to the mailbag.
6162080	6163080	Every week you guys send us emails.
6163080	6166080	Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com.
6166080	6169080	You know when the chat room's busted, email still works.
6169080	6173080	Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.
6173080	6176080	Last week we had a dry well in the email bag,
6176080	6179080	but I think tonight our fortune has changed a little bit, right?
6179080	6182080	Dark Soccer's going to dive into the mailbag and find some emails to read for you.
6182080	6183080	We have a couple.
6183080	6184080	Alright.
6184080	6185080	Alright.
6185080	6186080	Um...
6186080	6187080	God, long emails.
6187080	6188080	Okay.
6188080	6192080	Um, hello peoples, let us discuss something that is a frequent topic on the show,
6192080	6194080	food and the ruining of it.
6194080	6196080	Oh, Rob, you're going to like this one.
6196080	6197080	Okay.
6197080	6198080	Because you brought it up.
6198080	6202080	This weekend, Heinz announced that they would be putting into the market mayochup.
6202080	6203080	Next email.
6203080	6205080	A combination of mayonnaise and ketchup.
6205080	6207080	The reaction to this was wide and almost nearly negative,
6207080	6211080	including I've never been inspired to cyberbully a condiment company before,
6211080	6215080	but here we are at HeinzKetchup underscore US delete your account.
6215080	6216080	Sky.
6216080	6218080	Did somebody just email me my own tweet?
6218080	6219080	Yes.
6219080	6221080	Also another one for you.
6221080	6222080	Why would you ruin ketchup like this?
6222080	6223080	Also, Sky.
6225080	6226080	Yeah, that guy's smart.
6226080	6227080	Listen to him.
6227080	6229080	Why would you ruin ketchup like this?
6229080	6231080	Whose bright idea was this?
6231080	6235080	Like with many things, the people responsible for this travesty is the Mormons.
6235080	6237080	And it's talking about fry sauce.
6237080	6239080	Can we blame millennials for this?
6239080	6240080	It's millennials' fault.
6240080	6242080	Fry sauce is big in Utah.
6242080	6243080	I grew up on fry sauce.
6243080	6244080	I love fry sauce.
6244080	6246080	I expect to have fry sauce with lunch today.
6246080	6247080	Fry sauce exists.
6247080	6250080	It doesn't have a stupid jumbled up smoosh of a name.
6250080	6251080	It's called fry sauce.
6251080	6252080	You can buy it.
6252080	6253080	It exists.
6253080	6254080	This is already a thing.
6254080	6255080	Stay black, great entertainment.
6255080	6257080	Fry sauce in the South is much different.
6257080	6259080	So, just saying.
6259080	6263080	Is this like how iced tea in the South is different than everywhere else?
6263080	6264080	Oh my God.
6264080	6268080	So, one of my friends posted the best thing about iced tea and I have to find it because
6268080	6272080	this is the perfect thing.
6272080	6273080	And it's got to be real.
6273080	6276080	I actually sent it to my mother because it was so perfect and I don't normally send things
6276080	6279080	with cussing in it to my mother.
6279080	6284080	But this is absolute perfection in the form of a post and it's very recent and I'm going
6284080	6289080	to find it real quick because everyone needs to hear this because this is how I feel.
6289080	6290080	I'm torn.
6290080	6291080	Okay.
6291080	6294080	You know, I'm just going to pull up out of my message to my mother.
6294080	6295080	No, seriously.
6295080	6296080	It is that newsworthy.
6296080	6297080	Okay.
6297080	6299080	I'm just kind of like, all right.
6299080	6303080	The show is at a screeching halt right now to our Sakura because I got nothing until
6303080	6304080	we get to the next detail.
6304080	6305080	Okay.
6305080	6306080	All right.
6306080	6309080	I hate when I go up North and go to restaurants and the waiter comes to take my order and
6309080	6310080	I'm like, do y'all have sweet tea?
6310080	6313080	And they're like, no sweet sweetheart, but we have unsweetened iced tea.
6313080	6317080	We can give you some sugar packets like no you fucking Yankee because now the tea is
6317080	6321080	already cold so the sugar won't dissolve in it and it'll just sink to the bottom.
6321080	6322080	Be nasty.
6322080	6323080	Learn basic fucking solubility.
6323080	6324080	This is ninth grade chemistry.
6324080	6326080	That's why sweet tea exists in the first place.
6326080	6330080	You fucking heat the tea up and make it and then while it's still hot, you add the sugar
6330080	6332080	and then you chill it and it's sweet fucking tea.
6332080	6334080	I bet you pronounce pecan like pecan too.
6334080	6339080	So you four seasons having piece of shit.
6339080	6341080	And now you know how all of us in the South feel about it.
6341080	6342080	I'm almost positive.
6342080	6344080	I brought this up just a couple of weeks ago on the show, but the thing with sweet tea
6344080	6347080	is that when you order it here in California, you go, do you have sweet tea?
6347080	6349080	They'll be like, Oh yeah, we have the raspberry tea.
6349080	6354080	Mm hmm.
6354080	6355080	That is what they do.
6355080	6356080	Jamie, you know this.
6356080	6360080	If you were to go to like Denny's and ask for sweet tea, they'd be like, we have the
6360080	6361080	raspberry.
6361080	6362080	Yeah.
6362080	6363080	I'd be like, that is sweet tea here.
6363080	6364080	You know what you can have?
6364080	6368080	You can have a stick up your ass cause I'm going to shove it there and have a grand slam
6368080	6369080	witch.
6369080	6375080	You can have moons over Miami next email.
6375080	6378080	I remember when I went in and ordered a moons over my Turkey.
6378080	6382080	I think they have like, I think right now they have like the whole Han Solo themed crap
6382080	6383080	at Denny's.
6383080	6386080	And I have, I really try to avoid setting foot in at Denny's.
6386080	6390080	So I was driving back and forth myself to the Bay area yesterday.
6390080	6391080	So it was kind of a lonely drive.
6391080	6395080	Well, no, cause my friend John was nothing for part of it, but then he went to a soccer
6395080	6396080	game.
6396080	6398080	So, but going home, I was hungry.
6398080	6400080	So I was like, God, what's going to be open at 10 o'clock at night?
6400080	6402080	And I'm like, Oh my God, I'm gonna have to go to a Denny's.
6402080	6403080	So I just want to take a minute.
6403080	6404080	Bless you back.
6404080	6409080	Black bear diner for being available as an alternative and getting food that wasn't Denny's
6409080	6410080	food.
6410080	6411080	And that's all I have to say.
6411080	6412080	Well, I don't know.
6412080	6414080	Sweet tea almost gave me the diabetes.
6414080	6417080	Well, my favorite sweet tea story is Alan.
6417080	6421080	When we first got to Georgia, we went to that little diner and he was like, Oh man, I'm
6421080	6422080	so dehydrated from all that flying.
6422080	6426080	He drank like four sweet teas and he's like, why am I up till three in the morning?
6426080	6432080	I wonder why my granny used to make sweet tea and she would infuse saccharin in it at
6432080	6436080	the same time as all the sugar that she put in it while it was steeping.
6436080	6442080	It was strong as fuck and that is sweet tea and the kids were not allowed to have it after
6442080	6443080	eight o'clock.
6443080	6444080	All right.
6444080	6445080	Next email.
6445080	6446080	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6446080	6450080	You know, why am I the only one who ever deletes things out of the email box, Rob?
6451080	6453080	Cause you're the email person.
6453080	6454080	Mm hmm.
6454080	6456080	But when I'm not here, you don't delete anything.
6456080	6457080	Oh yeah, I sure don't.
6457080	6459080	Hi all, it's Raginator once again.
6459080	6462080	I just thought that I would pose a seemingly random question to everyone.
6462080	6465080	By now, most of us have been gamers for quite some time.
6465080	6466080	Not me.
6466080	6467080	I'm kidding.
6467080	6468080	Decades really.
6468080	6472080	With the only real differences being the platforms that we choose to play on as well as the genre
6472080	6473080	we enjoy.
6473080	6477080	We've played miscellaneous platforms and games over the years when they were brand new.
6477080	6483080	We've read various gaming magazines religiously for news tips, tricks, reviews, et cetera.
6483080	6485080	We've seen, not we've saw.
6485080	6490080	We have seen TV commercials galore and we've even engrossed ourselves in gaming related
6490080	6495080	media, TV shows and cartoons, movies, books, toys, collectibles, even cereal.
6495080	6498080	I never ate the video game cereals cause they were gross.
6498080	6499080	I did.
6499080	6500080	Just saying.
6500080	6501080	I hate marshmallows.
6501080	6502080	I don't like the switch cereal.
6502080	6505080	It tastes like switch cartridges.
6505080	6511080	Gaming culture, as we've each individually experienced, it really nestles in nicely with
6511080	6514080	the overall culture and has shaped us to become who we are today.
6514080	6520080	That being said, do each of you have a favorite 10 year, I was trying to say period in history
6520080	6522080	at the same time and it's coming up, history.
6522080	6527080	10 year period in as far as a gaming slash gaming culture slash gaming history.
6527080	6530080	For the purposes of this question, the answers don't have to conform to decades, i.e. the
6530080	6532080	80s, the 90s, et cetera.
6532080	6534080	Please give a reason for your answer.
6535080	6537080	Do I have to show my work?
6537080	6538080	Jesus.
6538080	6542080	I will go though for pretty much my teenage years as a gamer because that was the advent
6542080	6544080	of the Super Nintendo.
6544080	6555080	I would even say from the advent of the Super Nintendo through the life of the Saturn because
6555080	6561080	I was old enough to be able to save my own money and buy what I wanted and I, you know,
6561080	6568080	I stole my brother's Super Nintendo because they were little and I was the bigger sibling.
6568080	6570080	So I played a lot of Super Nintendo, just a ton.
6570080	6576080	I mean I also played a lot of NES but I really feel like my massive enjoyment and formative
6576080	6582080	years are really I guess where I put more skill into it was when I hit my teenage years.
6582080	6591080	And then I spent like, you know, my 20s going into, you know, the Dreamcast came out when
6591080	6594080	I was in my 20s, 1999.
6594080	6603080	So I just think that whole realm from maybe about 13 through 30, so not necessarily a
6603080	6608080	10-year period but that just period of time, it really seemed like the golden age of really
6608080	6610080	good games.
6610080	6614080	You know, even though my gut wants to say, oh, go for the retro answer because nothing
6614080	6617080	will ever be as good as the Super Nintendo when it was first out and, you know, those
6617080	6621080	years and everything, my honest answer, like honestly, and the thing that I'm just like,
6621080	6625080	no, this is what my heart says is the right answer is Memorial Day 2000 and the 10 years
6625080	6629080	that followed because that was the first time I ever saw DDR.
6629080	6633080	And then, you know, I got to play DDR the first time at the Rocky Horror Convention
6633080	6638080	that Halloween, which is the 25th anniversary collection or collection, 25th anniversary
6638080	6640080	gaming podcasting.
6640080	6645080	But my point is without that, I would not have met the people in this room.
6645080	6648080	I wouldn't have the show that y'all are listening to right now.
6648080	6654080	Like that was like the culture that formulated that now that I'm like pushing 40 and like
6654080	6658080	what's come the 16 years before it, you know, especially the heyday of the DDR years.
6658080	6662080	And obviously, I think a 10-year period is good because it takes us up through about
6662080	6667080	the time when Konami kind of started, you know, declining and so forth and started
6667080	6672080	closing, you know, Hawaii and the San Francisco Bay Area studio and kind of turned
6672080	6675080	into the, you know, not so great thing that it is now.
6675080	6677080	So, yeah, that's my answer.
6677080	6680080	Memorial Day 2000 and the 10 years that followed.
6680080	6682080	I almost agreed with that.
6682080	6687080	But I started with like the BM 98 stuff in the 90s.
6687080	6689080	So that was your first exposure to it.
6689080	6690080	That was mine.
6690080	6695080	But that 10-year period, though, is a pretty good gap of gaming history.
6695080	6700080	But I think that I wouldn't have been as into it if I hadn't had the same formation
6700080	6704080	with all of like the Saturn and import gaming, because I started import gaming before I moved
6704080	6705080	out here.
6705080	6707080	So, um, sorry.
6707080	6708080	Really quick.
6708080	6709080	Then we'll get to look at us.
6709080	6710080	Joe and her.
6710080	6711080	Matt is asking a chat.
6711080	6714080	Was that the same trip where you called Travis drunk Rob with the infamous voicemail that
6714080	6716080	I never lived down on under station life?
6716080	6720080	Yes, it was because I was with Jessica Harper and some other folks.
6720080	6723080	Actually, I think Princess Irene was there, too.
6723080	6725080	We were all there because we were all in the same Rocky cast.
6725080	6728080	And so we were all this and we were all the Star Trek experience.
6728080	6730080	So it was like I miss the Star Trek experience.
6730080	6731080	I swear.
6731080	6734080	Like, I think like Saturday we went to the Rocky thing.
6734080	6738080	And what's funny is that the video was circulating on Facebook this week of Eric McCormick as
6738080	6742080	frankenfurter singing karaoke to a sweet transvestite.
6742080	6744080	We were Jessica, myself, Prince Irene.
6744080	6746080	We were all in the audience for that.
6746080	6748080	I was there live and it's like watching it now.
6748080	6751080	I'm like, is this video from the 70s?
6751080	6754080	I'm like, it looks so grainy, but I'm like, nope.
6754080	6755080	It's just worn down over the years.
6755080	6756080	But we were there at Vegas.
6756080	6757080	The heart.
6757080	6761080	It was the Hard Rock Hotel, which I just heard this week is going to no longer.
6761080	6763080	There are no longer going to be Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas.
6763080	6765080	It's going to be the Virgin Hotel.
6765080	6766080	I remember.
6766080	6767080	Now, this is years after that.
6767080	6770080	But Jessica and I were there for DDR freak trip.
6770080	6771080	Yeah.
6771080	6772080	You guys did your random.
6772080	6773080	I was never.
6773080	6776080	And we called Travis and left him a drunk voicemail in honor of you.
6776080	6777080	Yes.
6777080	6778080	Yes.
6778080	6780080	And Tiara met us for the Star Trek experience.
6780080	6781080	Yeah.
6781080	6782080	So that was pretty fun.
6782080	6783080	I miss Star Trek experience.
6783080	6784080	You all don't even know.
6784080	6785080	I mean, that thing's been gone for years.
6785080	6789080	I just liked hanging out in quarks because I really did feel like I was on DS9 for a
6789080	6790080	moment.
6790080	6791080	It was very well done.
6791080	6792080	And hanging out with Klingons.
6792080	6795080	That whole ride and everything was very well done.
6795080	6796080	It was beautiful.
6796080	6798080	Um, you can sort of see it.
6798080	6804080	It is on the, um, I have the Blu-ray collection of all the next generation movies.
6804080	6808080	I bought it when I had swine flu and I was homebound for a week.
6808080	6810080	There is on the extras.
6810080	6811080	I gave you swine flu.
6811080	6812080	You did.
6812080	6813080	Not on purpose.
6813080	6818080	On the extras disc in there, there is a decommissioning of the Star Trek experience.
6818080	6823080	Um, and I actually got a little verklempt watching it, but you actually, it takes you
6823080	6825080	through both rides.
6825080	6828080	So somebody filmed it in Blu-ray quality, like you're going through both rides.
6828080	6831080	So that's the closest thing you can get now because I never did get to do the Borg thing.
6831080	6832080	So that was the only way I was able to do the Borg thing.
6832080	6833080	I didn't do that one either.
6833080	6835080	I did the, um, the Klingon.
6835080	6836080	Yeah, the original.
6836080	6840080	The original, but you could, so you can cut, but nothing compares to being there, especially
6840080	6843080	the tran, the transporter thing is such a great effect.
6843080	6846080	It was just awesome being on the bridge for a bit.
6846080	6847080	For sure.
6847080	6848080	For sure.
6848080	6849080	Anyway, nerd, nerd, nerd.
6849080	6851080	How about the email answer for you, Loki?
6851080	6855080	Uh, the 10 years of gaming that you liked the most, that defines you the most.
6855080	6857080	What was the criteria?
6857080	6862080	Um, I guess it would be what, do you have a favorite period?
6862080	6863080	Okay.
6863080	6864080	So yeah.
6864080	6865080	No, I don't.
6865080	6866080	I don't know.
6866080	6867080	I can't think of anything.
6867080	6870080	I mean, yeah, DDR was fun.
6870080	6874080	I say the next 20, next 10 years would be fun.
6874080	6877080	Uh, a hopeful answer.
6877080	6878080	It's the next 10 years.
6878080	6879080	Yeah.
6879080	6882080	Cause I can imagine with, you know, like how fast VR tech is going.
6882080	6883080	Okay.
6883080	6885080	All the hope has been killed in my heart.
6885080	6889080	I like, I like, that's a very hopeful, positive answer from Loki.
6889080	6892080	And I will be sorely disappointed, but that's all right.
6893080	6897080	Are you saying that the Nintendo, everything since the launch of the Nintendo Switch is
6897080	6898080	your answer?
6898080	6899080	Oh no.
6899080	6902080	They're in their own little country where they're doing their own shit about, you know,
6902080	6906080	not, not really listening to the consumer as far as what we want.
6906080	6910080	Nintendo Switch is virtual console or, you know, Animal Crossing with virtual console
6910080	6911080	games.
6911080	6913080	You're looking forward for Ready Player One to be real.
6913080	6914080	Yes, please.
6914080	6915080	All right.
6915080	6916080	That's what it is.
6916080	6919080	There's more to the email cause Reginator of course gave us his answer.
6919080	6920080	Of course.
6920080	6923080	For me, my favorite period was from 87 to 97.
6923080	6925080	Reasons are several fold really.
6925080	6929080	NES was really becoming popular in 87 and I had received the deluxe set for Christmas
6929080	6930080	that year.
6930080	6934080	We saw the beginnings of gaming becoming mainstream with movies and TV shows like Super Mario
6934080	6939080	Brothers movie, Double Dragon, Super Mario Super Show, Captain N, and countless others.
6939080	6944080	We transitioned from 8-bit generation to the 16-bit generation and saw the whole Sega vs.
6944080	6946080	Nintendo console war take off.
6946080	6950080	There was the multimedia boom of the early nineties where PCs and consoles that could
6950080	6953080	use CDs and thus full motion video became big.
6953080	6957080	There were also a plethora of consoles and handhelds released at this time, most of which
6957080	6960080	flopped in the end of some made impact.
6960080	6964080	Our kids were revitalized with the surge of fighting games like Street Fighter II and
6964080	6965080	Mortal Kombat.
6965080	6967080	He wrote Kombat, not Kombat.
6967080	6971080	Is it like a, like where you do a betting pool against who's going to win the Mortal
6971080	6972080	Kombat?
6972080	6973080	That would be, uh...
6973080	6974080	Mortal Kombat.
6974080	6975080	What is that called?
6975080	6976080	I can't remember.
6976080	6977080	It's, uh...
6977080	6978080	Blood support.
6978080	6979080	Salt.
6979080	6981080	I can't remember what they call that.
6981080	6983080	There is a Twitch thing.
6983080	6984080	Salty bet.
6984080	6985080	Okay.
6985080	6989080	Some political opportunist tasted blood in the water and started attacking gaming.
6989080	6992080	I could go on and on, but this email is already getting too long.
6992080	6996080	This email was brought to you by Old Potatoes.
6996080	6997080	How old?
6997080	6998080	I don't know.
6998080	7001080	Like so old that they started growing vines out of them?
7001080	7003080	But he did the pfft at the end.
7003080	7006080	So, which is what the colon P is.
7006080	7007080	Right.
7007080	7008080	All right.
7008080	7009080	Is that it for emails?
7009080	7010080	Stephanie.
7010080	7014080	Participate at orangelandrater.com if you'd like to email us for a future episode and
7014080	7016080	ask us a question like that one.
7016080	7017080	That was a pretty good question.
7017080	7019080	We have some good answers there.
7019080	7022080	We have some more news stories before we get to a few calls tonight.
7022080	7026080	I do have to, because I do have the movie after the show, I do have to end the show
7026080	7027080	right at a certain time tonight.
7027080	7029080	So sorry, but also not sorry.
7029080	7032080	So first we have some news to get to.
7033080	7037080	So Valve has updated their privacy options.
7037080	7045080	Basically, they're allowing Steam users to choose how their, you know, I guess their
7045080	7047080	activities are being viewed.
7047080	7050080	So, by default, everything is hidden.
7050080	7054080	So your library and other data like that.
7054080	7061080	Unfortunately, along with that, because it relied on those public, the public libraries
7061080	7067080	being scraped and everything, Steam Spy, which is basically a service that kind of helped
7067080	7074080	calculate, you know, game sales as well as how much a game is being played and that type
7074080	7075080	of stuff.
7075080	7078080	Almost like wages to be able to chart sales and everything.
7078080	7088080	It is now broken because everybody's profile is now set to hidden by default.
7088080	7091080	That's unfortunate.
7091080	7093080	And unfortunately, there's not really anything they can do.
7093080	7098080	So until everything's visible by default, there's not going to be able to operate
7098080	7099080	Steam Spy anymore.
7099080	7101080	I wonder why Steam decided to make this change.
7101080	7105080	Were they specifically just trying to get at Steam Spy or is it just maybe it's because
7105080	7108080	of all the privacy stuff going on?
7108080	7111080	I mean, even though I know Facebook and Steam really have nothing to do with each other,
7111080	7115080	besides the fact that you can link the two, everything that Facebook's going through
7115080	7117080	right now with all their bullshit.
7117080	7122080	Like maybe Steam is like, maybe we should need to turn like high privacy on by default.
7122080	7124080	I'm not really sure what the reason was behind it.
7124080	7127080	I don't think it was in on purpose to destroy Steam Spy.
7127080	7129080	I think it was probably other things they were doing.
7129080	7133080	It's probably everything else going on in the world regarding privacy on the internet
7133080	7137080	where they were like, you know what, we need to, we need to err on the caution of privacy
7137080	7141080	and things being private and friends only is the default option, which is really the
7141080	7146080	Yeah, it was really the way things ought to be, but you don't make money that way,
7146080	7147080	I suppose.
7147080	7148080	All right.
7148080	7151080	Well, the BAFTAs happened this past week.
7151080	7153080	That is the, uh, what does BAFTAs stand for?
7153080	7155080	British Academy Film and Television Arts.
7155080	7156080	That's what it stands for.
7156080	7163080	The 14th Annual Game Awards were held this past week and, uh, some winners from this
7163080	7169080	a best performance, uh, Malina Jergens, who is in Hellblade, uh, Suna's Sacrifice, which
7169080	7171080	she was winning that award a lot of places.
7171080	7174080	So, not too, uh, uh, shocked to hear that.
7174080	7177080	Best Original Property, Horizon Zero Dawn.
7177080	7179080	Best Narrative, Night in the Woods.
7179080	7181080	Best Music, Cuphead.
7181080	7182080	That's a good choice.
7182080	7185080	Uh, Best Multiplayer, Divinity Original Sin 2.
7185080	7188080	Best Mobile, Golf Clash.
7188080	7192080	Best Game Innova- Innova- Innovation, The Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild.
7192080	7195080	Best Game Design, Super Mario Odyssey.
7195080	7199080	Gamed Beyond Entertainment, Hellblade Suna's Sacrifice.
7199080	7201080	Best Family Game, Mario Odyssey.
7201080	7203080	Best Evolving Game, Overwatch.
7203080	7207080	Best Debut Game, Gorogora- Gorogoa, excuse me.
7207080	7210080	Uh, Hellblade also got the British Game and Audio Achievement.
7210080	7211080	Best British Game.
7211080	7213080	Artistic Achievement, also Hellblade.
7213080	7217080	But then the Best Game, something that didn't win an award anywhere else.
7217080	7220080	The Best Game, the Game of the Year.
7220080	7224080	What Remains of Edith Finch was the game that they gave Game of the Year to at the BAFTAs.
7224080	7228080	Now, I get it because I thought Edith Finch was amazing.
7228080	7231080	And if you haven't played that game, I think it's a great story.
7231080	7234080	And it's not going to take you a super long time to get through it.
7234080	7236080	It's a few hours, about the length of a long movie.
7236080	7239080	Um, but I thought that was a great gaming experience.
7239080	7245080	And, you know, but then again, I know some people have strong opinions on walking simulators.
7245080	7253080	Now, granted, um, Edith Finch has some more interactive, kind of mini-game-esque sort of things.
7253080	7260080	That, like, unlike Gone Home, which really didn't have a lot of, you know, gamey elements in it.
7260080	7265080	It was more of like a, you know, a story that you played, you participated in.
7265080	7268080	Um, which I still love. That's not a slam on Gone Home. I love Gone Home.
7268080	7271080	I do think Edith Finch had a couple more, at least, gamey elements in it.
7271080	7273080	So, it might satisfy some of those people.
7273080	7276080	I love those games. Like, I think as long as the story is great.
7276080	7279080	You all know I fucking love Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.
7279080	7281080	I think that game is magnificent.
7281080	7282080	I streamed that.
7282080	7285080	It gets shit on unnecessarily all the time.
7285080	7288080	I think Firewatch is fucking great, too.
7288080	7291080	I think it's cool that that game is finally coming out on the Switch.
7291080	7295080	But I'm also kind of like, well, it's been out for forever. You should have played it by now.
7295080	7297080	But I guess Nintendo does have a separate audience.
7297080	7302080	So, I mean, those games, all of them I think are great and worth your time.
7303080	7305080	Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
7305080	7312080	I have, it's kind of just a little, what's the word I'm thinking of, like a personal touch kind of story.
7312080	7313080	Sure.
7313080	7316080	And it's something that just made me feel really happy to see.
7316080	7328080	Because, um, there is a Welsh craft that is creating these balls that you sew into these different patterns.
7329080	7337080	And I may not have brought this up, but my family's ancestry is Welsh, a good number of it.
7337080	7343080	But there is a lady named Karen Royer who is a grandmother who loves to play video games.
7343080	7346080	Especially taken with Assassin's Creed.
7346080	7351080	Her name online is the Assassin.
7351080	7358080	And she, I'm sorry, I was actually using the wrong one.
7358080	7362080	It's the Ukrainian egg art, not the Welsh balls. Although the Welsh balls are also neat.
7362080	7370080	But she and her family had different interests.
7370080	7372080	But she wanted to do egg kits.
7373080	7375080	And she had gotten interested in doing that.
7375080	7380080	They're basically, they're called, I'm going to mispronounce it, Pisanki.
7380080	7384080	Where you poke holes in a raw egg to drain the eggs.
7384080	7386080	And you blow out the egg white and the yolks.
7386080	7390080	And then you cover them with layers of colored wax.
7390080	7395080	And then you use a candle to melt designs over the wax.
7395080	7404080	And so what she's wanting to do is work with professors at, I need to find what WPI stands for.
7404080	7408080	I think it's one of the local schools. Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
7408080	7417080	To create a game that uses basically mathematical patterns.
7417080	7424080	So they're using computer science and computer learning to try to make those eggs in a virtual environment.
7424080	7430080	And so they are working on it as a project to turn it into a full-fledged game.
7430080	7432080	I think that's kind of neat.
7432080	7435080	When you take two things that you love and marry them together.
7435080	7443080	But on top of that, when you're learning something, basically a mathematical process in a virtual environment.
7443080	7446080	Finding something that you love makes it live a lot better.
7446080	7448080	And I just think it's kind of cool.
7448080	7454080	I'd like to see more traditional crafts have a way to live through video games.
7454080	7457080	So I just thought it would be a neat interesting story.
7457080	7460080	And she actually made a game, Loki.
7460080	7464080	She was being graded for it.
7464080	7466080	I had to.
7466080	7471080	And then she's really working in the calculation.
7471080	7475080	But then she's also working on bringing in a new one which is lace eggs.
7475080	7479080	Where you use a drill to make lace like cuts in the eggs.
7479080	7481080	That's cool.
7481080	7483080	So it's like a crafty sort of game.
7483080	7486080	I've seen people use exacto knives to do patterns in eggs.
7486080	7489080	So there's actually back in the day.
7489080	7491080	Now this is getting a little bit into history.
7491080	7495080	But in the Victorian era, it was a popular Easter egg thing.
7495080	7497080	That you would blow out the eggs like that.
7497080	7500080	And use a little bit of wax to seal the bottom of the egg.
7500080	7503080	And make chocolate marbled eggs that way.
7503080	7505080	And you let them harden in the shell.
7505080	7509080	Then they open the shell and there's chocolate inside instead of egg.
7509080	7512080	So I think it's just.
7512080	7514080	Is that where Cadbury eggs come from?
7514080	7516080	Possibly actually. I wouldn't be surprised.
7516080	7518080	I had a Reese's egg.
7518080	7519080	Yummy.
7519080	7521080	It's so good.
7521080	7523080	I would eat a chocolate peanut butter filled egg.
7523080	7525080	You know what though?
7525080	7528080	My favorite eggs always and I'm sorry I haven't been to a touch of Britain lately.
7528080	7530080	Are Mars eggs.
7530080	7533080	If anyone in England wants to send me Mars eggs, please do.
7533080	7535080	Because they're amazing.
7535080	7536080	Okay.
7536080	7537080	Just saying.
7537080	7538080	All right.
7538080	7541080	Oh, you might find them at the not just the touch of Britain.
7541080	7544080	But that store at the lolly and pop or whatever it is that has all the import stuff.
7544080	7545080	The mall.
7545080	7546080	It's expensive though.
7546080	7547080	It's expensive.
7547080	7548080	But they have it.
7548080	7549080	I haven't been there.
7549080	7551080	Touch of Britain would always just sell them for like 75 cents.
7551080	7552080	That's not bad at all.
7552080	7553080	Yeah.
7553080	7555080	But I could also get like rhubarb custard candies.
7555080	7556080	And spotted dick.
7556080	7558080	And spotted dick.
7558080	7559080	All right.
7559080	7562080	Let's just get a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line.
7562080	7563080	Which you can give us a call.
7563080	7564080	Orange Lounge Radio.
7564080	7565080	All one word on Skype.
7565080	7567080	But first, Loki.
7567080	7572080	Sadly, once again, to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of Grand Theft Auto 4.
7572080	7575080	Rockstar has to remove some music from the game.
7575080	7578080	Much like they do with San Andreas and even Vice City.
7578080	7586080	So, apparently on the 26th there's going to be an update that's going to remove quite a few songs from the game.
7586080	7591080	Apparently the rumor is that these are all part of the Russian pop station.
7591080	7597080	Was it Vladivostok FM?
7597080	7598080	I believe that's how you pronounce it.
7598080	7600080	It's been a while since I played the game.
7600080	7602080	Honestly, my favorite station in the whole game.
7602080	7605080	Because it had all the cool electronica music in there.
7605080	7608080	And they had like piano by Eric Prides and stuff like that.
7608080	7611080	That was my jam when I was killing people in the game at least.
7611080	7614080	But they're going to replace it with something.
7614080	7618080	So I guess we'll find out in a couple weeks what exactly they're replacing it with.
7618080	7622080	And if it sucks, there's always mods to put it back in.
7622080	7627080	Or just don't plug in your thing to download the patch.
7627080	7628080	Or if the patch...
7628080	7630080	Eh, it's Steam. It's going to download it anyways.
7630080	7632080	You can stop it from downloading.
7632080	7635080	Eh, I just don't care.
7635080	7637080	That's probably what they're thinking most people do.
7637080	7640080	They probably have to do this because of, again, the licensing.
7640080	7641080	Music licensing, yeah.
7641080	7643080	Exactly. So they have to kind of do their due diligence.
7643080	7645080	But there will be ways around it. You're absolutely right.
7645080	7646080	Modding will put it right back in.
7646080	7647080	Yeah.
7647080	7649080	If not, you know...
7649080	7652080	Or maybe the new songs are going to be badass. Who knows?
7652080	7655080	Alright. Well, you want to be careful when you're surfing around the internet.
7655080	7661080	Because sometimes if you download the wrong thing, too much porn, you might end up with ransomware on your PC.
7661080	7663080	Nah, you never get ransomware from downloading porn.
7663080	7665080	Alright, well, alright. Anyway.
7665080	7668080	We're downloading free games. Piracy. That's how you get it.
7668080	7669080	Eh, yeah.
7669080	7670080	If you're not careful.
7670080	7672080	Anyway, not that you should be doing that.
7672080	7675080	But anyway, this is an interesting new sort of ransomware.
7675080	7678080	And you might be hearing about this around the internet.
7678080	7683080	This is a new malware where your computer is all locked up and all the files are encrypted and stuff.
7683080	7688080	And you can't unlock them until you play Player Unknown Battlegrounds.
7688080	7691080	That's it. They don't want your money. They don't want your Bitcoin.
7691080	7693080	Guess who doesn't have to worry about that?
7693080	7699080	You just have to play Player Unknown Battlegrounds for one hour.
7699080	7702080	The software will make the file inaccessible when you get infected by this.
7702080	7705080	Which usually is, you know, the whole Bitcoin thing.
7705080	7709080	But for this, don't worry. I don't want money. Just play PUBG for one hour.
7709080	7713080	What if I don't have PUBG and then now I have to download it?
7713080	7714080	You're gonna have to buy it, I guess. There it is.
7714080	7716080	Guess who doesn't have to worry about that shit?
7716080	7717080	On the Mac?
7717080	7718080	I love my Mac.
7718080	7720080	Because PUBG won't run on that.
7720080	7722080	But on top of that, viruses also.
7722080	7726080	Nah, you're not immune. You're not immune to viruses on that thing.
7726080	7727080	But.
7727080	7728080	There are less of them.
7728080	7730080	There are a bajillion times easier to remove.
7730080	7735080	So anyway, malware experts have confirmed this is really what it does.
7735080	7737080	It really does lock down the files.
7737080	7741080	But they do say it's pretty easy to get around because it only encrypts the desktop files.
7741080	7746080	And then unlocks them after three minutes in Battlegrounds, not an hour.
7746080	7751080	That's about the amount of time it takes to go into a game, get killed, and that's it.
7751080	7754080	So there's also other workarounds if you want.
7754080	7757080	Maybe you would rather play Fortnite. I don't know.
7757080	7760080	There's an unlock code if you really can't be bothered.
7760080	7762080	I guess that's...
7762080	7765080	There is an unlock code if you really, really can't be bothered.
7765080	7766080	What's the point?
7766080	7768080	That's very good.
7768080	7770080	Actually, one of the malware experts said,
7770080	7776080	it's unsure if this is something you will actually be spread or if it's just being made as a joke.
7776080	7780080	You know, sometimes some programmers up and coming in college,
7780080	7786080	they actually write viruses to learn as part of the programming and the intricate workings of a computer.
7786080	7792080	But they contain things like this that are very easy to shut down so they don't actually pose a real threat.
7792080	7795080	So I wonder if this wasn't just somebody's pet project where it's like,
7795080	7799080	I want to just see if I can do it, but I don't want it to actually hurt people.
7799080	7802080	So, kind of interesting.
7802080	7803080	I don't know.
7803080	7805080	Yeah, Tigerclaw says it could be worse.
7805080	7808080	They could force you to get winner, winner, chicken dinner to unlock your computer.
7808080	7811080	Winner, winner, unlock key.
7811080	7814080	That's alright. Fortnite's what I prefer anyway.
7814080	7815080	No, I'm just kidding. I haven't played either of them.
7815080	7818080	I watch people play Fortnite and I'm like so overwhelmed.
7818080	7823080	Like, how do they build stuff so fast in that game?
7823080	7827080	Well, now they have the whole like in the shelter, like portable shelter thing.
7827080	7830080	Oh, really? That's interesting.
7830080	7832080	One of my friends, by the way, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.
7832080	7835080	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7835080	7837080	Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7837080	7843080	One of my friends that I know through Ingress who's like, he just started doing game streaming.
7843080	7845080	He was playing Fortnite and I was watching his stream.
7845080	7850080	And first off, I was laughing my ass off because he was playing like a team Fortnite game.
7850080	7855080	And he had three other people on his team that were all like nine and ten year olds.
7855080	7860080	And I could hear their voices were like, they were like screaming on top of each other.
7860080	7863080	And I could like hear parents in the background. It was crazy.
7863080	7865080	But I was, I was laughing and having a good time.
7865080	7867080	I would love this. I could play Fortnite.
7867080	7869080	I just don't have a place to do it very quietly.
7869080	7872080	Oh, yeah. You'd have the same thing with screaming kids in the background.
7872080	7874080	Anyway, we got a call coming in. Let's do it.
7874080	7876080	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7876080	7877080	Hey, what's up, everyone? It's Ranma.
7877080	7879080	Hey, Ranma. How you doing, buddy?
7879080	7880080	I'm doing good. How about you?
7880080	7882080	I am super. Thanks for asking.
7882080	7886080	Why am I not surprised you said that?
7886080	7888080	What's on your mind, my friend?
7888080	7892080	There's a lot of stuff on my mind, but I will say that for another time.
7892080	7901080	I just want to say, last week, I saw Ready Player One, motherfucking movie of the year.
7902080	7904080	Is that only the year?
7905080	7908080	I don't care. It's movie of the year. I don't care.
7909080	7915080	I went all out. I saw it in 4DX. I was like, I have to go back and see this movie again.
7915080	7917080	Nice. I'm sure Loki approves.
7917080	7921080	What did you like, without spoiling, what did you like so much about it?
7921080	7925080	I actually like more the aspects of the cameo appearances
7925080	7929080	because I'm one of those who looks for things like the Easter eggs.
7929080	7933080	So I spent half the time pointing out the different characters and stuff like that
7933080	7937080	and just fanboying the poor little nerd that I am.
7939080	7945080	Fair enough. So you're a fan of the Easter egg extravaganza that they do in the game.
7945080	7949080	Yeah, I just wasn't expecting so many. I really enjoyed the storyline.
7949080	7954080	I just enjoyed the movie as a whole and the whole virtual reality experience.
7954080	7958080	And I'm like, if you think about it, we're not too far from that, you know?
7959080	7960080	Oh.
7962080	7966080	I just have to go back and see it again in 3D this time.
7966080	7967080	Alright.
7968080	7970080	Have you seen it yet? I don't remember.
7970080	7972080	I haven't. Loki has. I haven't.
7972080	7975080	Sadly, it is not the movie I'm seeing tonight.
7975080	7979080	I'm seeing Love, Simon tonight because I figure with Avengers coming out,
7979080	7981080	Love, Simon's going to be gone.
7981080	7984080	There's only so much theater space.
7984080	7986080	I totally get that. I totally do.
7986080	7989080	Yeah, but Ready Player One, I still haven't seen it.
7989080	7992080	You have to see Ready Player One in 4D. Seriously.
7992080	7995080	I will. I'm so uncool, Rama. I still haven't seen Black Panther.
7995080	7999080	Neither have I. Do you know I've been raked across the coals for it.
7999080	8001080	Really? Why?
8001080	8006080	I don't want to get political or anything like that.
8006080	8011080	It's just that a lot of people look at me like, well, you're black.
8011080	8013080	You should go see Black Panther.
8013080	8017080	And my response is, I'm not really big on the Marvel movies.
8017080	8022080	Age of Ultron left a sour taste in my mouth and I just have been a big Marvel fan.
8022080	8027080	Even though I need to go see it because two of my friends were in the film as stunt doubles,
8027080	8031080	but I will eventually get around to when it's up to it.
8031080	8035080	It's just that my tastes in movies are different from everybody else's.
8035080	8038080	And like I said, I was more hyped.
8038080	8042080	Honestly, I'm more hyped for Ready Player One and Alita Battle Angel,
8042080	8048080	which just got pushed to December over Black Panther, Infinity War and all of that.
8048080	8051080	It's not my nerdom, you know?
8051080	8053080	That's fair. I mean, I get it.
8053080	8057080	But I don't want to say I see both sides because at the same time it's your money.
8057080	8058080	Spend it how you want.
8058080	8062080	But I do also understand the desire of people to want to elevate Black Panther
8062080	8066080	because we need to show Hollywood that they should be making more movies
8066080	8072080	that star Black people that are not like, you know, maids and gang members
8072080	8074080	and the things that we saw in the 90s.
8074080	8075080	Kids need the representation.
8075080	8077080	Exactly. Representation. So I get it.
8077080	8078080	And I totally get that.
8078080	8079080	Yeah.
8079080	8086080	But I just feel like I shouldn't have to go see it to show the representation like I'm required to.
8086080	8088080	I'd rather go see it of my own volition.
8088080	8093080	There is absolutely hundreds of other types of Black arts you could support.
8093080	8094080	I get it.
8094080	8097080	Yeah. And the movie is so popular.
8097080	8101080	It's just, hell, a couple of times I have work.
8101080	8104080	People are threatening to pull my Black card because I haven't seen it.
8104080	8106080	And I'm like, look.
8106080	8110080	I didn't know there were Black cards, too, because did you know there's gay cards as well?
8110080	8111080	Oh, I believe it.
8111080	8115080	And I've said to people, look, my Black card was pulled about 15 years ago.
8115080	8118080	If you want it here, just get on the line.
8118080	8123080	If I somehow get it again, I will raffle it off so whoever wins the raffle can pull my card.
8123080	8127080	Because I kind of don't want it.
8127080	8128080	All right. All right.
8128080	8130080	Anyway, what else I want to ask you?
8130080	8133080	Oh, anything else you want to share with us tonight?
8133080	8139080	The thing is, I was also reminiscing about the talk about Space Channel 5.
8139080	8141080	And then I heard the talk about DDR.
8141080	8146080	And I'm just reminded about 10 years ago, a bunch of my friends, one of them, Jez,
8146080	8148080	I think you met him at Capsicon once.
8148080	8153080	We actually did a Space Channel 5 versus Dance Dance Revolution skit.
8153080	8155080	Nice. That's awesome.
8155080	8158080	And we were going to go all out.
8158080	8162080	After Team DDR and Team Space Channel 5 battled each other,
8162080	8165080	we were going to have a giant space Michael to come out.
8165080	8168080	We were going to join forces and dance to take him out and all of that.
8168080	8171080	But we did not have enough time to get that done together.
8171080	8174080	Well, you know what? There's always next year.
8175080	8178080	No, no, I'm done.
8179080	8183080	I'm like Danny, when it comes to masquerade skits now,
8183080	8185080	I'm like Danny Glover from Lethal Weapon.
8185080	8187080	I'm getting too old for this shit.
8187080	8194080	I have to prepare my body three months in advance of stretches, calisthenics,
8194080	8196080	training, remembering how to dance.
8196080	8197080	You're missing your calling.
8197080	8200080	You're missing your calling, stage parent.
8201080	8202080	Shh.
8202080	8208080	Honestly, I'd rather sit there, record the masquerade,
8208080	8213080	have my flask, I'd be a snarky ass motherfucker on Twitter about the skits.
8213080	8217080	Oh, I see. Like the old guys who sit up in the balcony on the Muppets.
8217080	8218080	I understand completely.
8218080	8220080	Yes, that was in World War.
8220080	8224080	All right, Rama, I'm going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call.
8224080	8225080	You take care, okay?
8225080	8227080	You stay awesome, my friend.
8227080	8229080	I will always. You stay fabulous yourself.
8229080	8230080	Oh, you know it, honey.
8230080	8231080	All right, bye.
8234080	8237080	Orange Laundry Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to get through.
8237080	8240080	Again, that's Orange Laundry Radio, all one word on Skype.
8240080	8243080	I should check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.
8243080	8244080	No.
8244080	8245080	No?
8245080	8246080	There's nothing.
8246080	8247080	How about you, Dark Soccer?
8247080	8249080	Anything last minute you want to talk about?
8249080	8251080	No, and these are all expensive.
8251080	8252080	What's expensive?
8252080	8256080	The tank tops I'm looking at, and there's one that looks like Cora's outfit.
8256080	8257080	Oh, for your Disney stuff again?
8257080	8262080	But it's a cold shoulder shirt, you know, like her outfit was, but it's going to be in May.
8262080	8263080	I'm going to burn.
8263080	8264080	Oh, yeah.
8264080	8265080	So I'm looking for tank tops.
8265080	8269080	It was crazy hot today just out catching Pokémon, and then it's supposed to rain.
8269080	8271080	I don't know if it rained during the show, but...
8271080	8272080	The clouds were coming in.
8272080	8273080	Jeez.
8273080	8274080	Yeah.
8274080	8275080	It's crazy how weather can change, doesn't it?
8275080	8276080	Weather.
8276080	8278080	It's fascinating.
8278080	8279080	Crazy stuff.
8279080	8283080	All right, well, that's going to do it, I guess, for the Skype line tonight.
8283080	8285080	If you didn't get through, you can always send us an email.
8285080	8289080	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place where you can send us an email,
8289080	8297080	and you can also tweet us at O-L-R, or, of course, join in on the Discord, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
8297080	8302080	But we're going to move around and start to wrap up here tonight for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8302080	8305080	Thank you, guys, as always, for listening to our show.
8305080	8306080	We appreciate all the support.
8306080	8309080	We would really, really appreciate it if you tell a friend or two about the show.
8309080	8312080	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
8312080	8314080	but we need the voices here in order to air them.
8314080	8315080	You know what else is great?
8315080	8318080	It's a nice five-star review on iTunes.
8318080	8321080	In the past year, we've gotten one, so it would be fantastic.
8321080	8325080	I say it every week, so if you guys could please, please leave us a nice review.
8325080	8328080	It would super be appreciated here at Orange Lounge Radio.
8328080	8329080	Thank you so much.
8329080	8333080	I should say one in the U.S. store, because I don't always get a chance to check Canada and U.K.
8333080	8335080	I try to check them once in a while.
8335080	8338080	I think there's some website where you can see them all, but I always forget to do that.
8338080	8342080	So if I'm neglecting an overseas review, I apologize.
8342080	8346080	I tend to focus on the U.S. store, because it is kind of a bitch to hop around all the different markets.
8346080	8351080	But a nice five-star review somewhere else, like Google Play or one of those places would be great, too.
8351080	8353080	Super appreciate that.
8353080	8359080	And yeah, just be here and participate with our show, and we'll keep making them for you.
8359080	8362080	We'll be back next week with Episode 727.
8362080	8367080	But before we wrap it up here tonight, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
8367080	8368080	And I'll start with my final thought.
8368080	8371080	My final thought is movie adventure.
8371080	8372080	Yay, movies.
8372080	8376080	Even though it's a Sunday night and I have a class to teach tomorrow, I'm going to be dead tired.
8376080	8377080	But that's all right.
8377080	8378080	Fun, fun.
8378080	8380080	Loki, your final thought tonight?
8380080	8384080	My final thought is hopefully I'll play more games this week.
8384080	8389080	And hopefully I'll be awake enough to actually work on a game.
8389080	8391080	I've been trying.
8391080	8392080	It's just not been working.
8392080	8394080	My head's been killing me.
8394080	8396080	Or I've been just exhausted at the end of the day.
8396080	8398080	Does your promotion start Monday, or did it start this last week?
8398080	8401080	Well, it technically started last week.
8401080	8404080	But we're still in the transition phase of moving me over to the stuff.
8404080	8406080	So I've been kind of still doing my old job.
8406080	8409080	And so, I mean, I've been sort of doing the new stuff, too.
8409080	8413080	And kind of what I did with my old job is sort of what I do with my new job.
8413080	8415080	I don't know. It's slowly getting there.
8415080	8417080	At least the paycheck's coming up.
8417080	8419080	Oh, the paycheck definitely came.
8419080	8422080	In fact, I think they retroactively paid me for the whole last period.
8422080	8425080	So I got paid for my previous position and the new position.
8425080	8426080	Nice.
8426080	8427080	On top of it.
8427080	8429080	So I may be looking to get a switch soon.
8429080	8430080	Oh, there you go.
8430080	8431080	I want to.
8431080	8432080	But I have to pass that.
8432080	8436080	The wife will not be happy with that because I bought a DDR machine.
8436080	8440080	I was not supposed to get any more anythings for a long time.
8440080	8441080	I'll buy her something she wants.
8441080	8442080	Tiller's research for the show.
8442080	8443080	Yeah, research.
8443080	8445080	No, that'll never fly.
8445080	8446080	Tiller, you won it.
8446080	8447080	All right.
8447080	8450080	Dark Soccer, last but not least, your final thought tonight?
8450080	8453080	It's going to be a long wait for DragCon.
8454080	8455080	It'll be here before you know it.
8455080	8456080	It's like three weeks away.
8456080	8459080	Yeah, but at least this week is this week.
8459080	8461080	I also learned something, Rob.
8461080	8464080	And here's a little tip for people who are poor.
8464080	8467080	If you go out for Mongolian barbecue and they let you take home your leftovers,
8467080	8471080	save it, cook up some rice and make fried rice out of it the next day.
8471080	8473080	It's actually delicious.
8473080	8474080	It tastes like drunk food.
8474080	8476080	I need to have more Mongolian barbecue.
8476080	8477080	Sounds delicious.
8477080	8480080	Anyway, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange L'Antrayo.
8480080	8482080	We'll see you in seven days to do it all again next time.
8482080	8484080	Until then, bye.
8512080	8516080	See you next week.
8542080	8545080	Thank you.
