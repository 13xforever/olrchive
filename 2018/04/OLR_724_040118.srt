00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This week we don't have a script, but we do have a lead. John Cena's gonna kick ass and chew bubblegum. But he's all out of gum.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is just one story on tonight's show. Stay tuned for this, generational upgrades and plenty more news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well hello once again everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Orange Lounge Radio. Not live tonight with episode number 724 for this April the 1st of 2018.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And that is no joke. No joke here at OLR tonight, but it is gonna be a little bit of Orange Lounge Radio unplugged.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll get to that in a minute, but first I have to go around and introduce everybody.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Myself, I'm Rob Roberts or on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joined as always by my co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Orange Dead Radio

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Orange Dead, yes cause we're not live.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Exactly. Dead. I like that.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Dead Lounge Radio.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That would be the Halloween episode or episode 666 which we already did.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We hit the point where we've already passed episode 666.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We're beyond evil.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Beyond good and evil.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What would be the next big episode number?

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
777, the lucky sevens.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I guess so. I guess so. We'll be looking forward to that.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We've already had episode gonanami.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, I know. I know. They've all happened.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Anyway, also here tonight, of course, Techmaster Loki.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hello.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm fine.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Good. Alright, I'm gonna just ask you right at the top because I know somewhere out there, even though we're not live tonight, we don't have our chatters.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We don't have anything going on, which is weird. It's like a piece of us is missing tonight, but that's why it's OLR unplugged.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But I know if we did have the chat room going, Tigerclaw would be lighting it up going, Ready Player One, Ready Player One, Ready Player One.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I saw it. I saw it. Did you see it? Did you see it? So, Loki, I'm sure you had to go see it.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I had to go see it. It was awesome.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You didn't see it, right? Because I didn't see it.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Alright, I didn't think so.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We were gonna go see it, right?

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We can. He wanted to go tomorrow. I'm supposed to play Pokemon Go with Shane tomorrow, but I don't know how into that he is.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm gonna go be a drag nun, so.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Tomorrow? I thought it was Sunday.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm leaving Sunday because I'm staying with JD.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, well tell that kid I said hi.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I will.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Alright, anyway, if he's not listening to this, then hi.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But JD's gonna have to put up with all of that makeup.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The bathroom's gonna be white by the time I'm done.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Girl, like it's the first time. Alright, anyway.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So alright, Ready Player One, the Loki review, and go.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, I mean, I really liked it. I knew I was gonna like it.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Of course you were.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And it didn't let me down. I thought, you know, if we're gonna say, you know, video game movies.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I think it did, um, there was definitely a lot of video game stuff in the movie. That's for sure.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I mean, cameos like crazy of everything.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Just, um, and I think it's just really well done.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I like how they incorporated a lot of even like Street Fighter was in there.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Um, they incorporated some of that stuff.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Um, you know, I like the changes that they made against the book and stuff.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Some people had issues with that. But honestly, if you're gonna do it exactly like the book.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Some of that would have been really boring to watch.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And that would have been something like if you were gonna stretch this out to like three movies or something.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That you could have probably done that.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But I kinda like how they did everything.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's, they have like, the thing that you see in the trailers all the time, like the big brace for the copper key.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Like that sequence right there, it's done with no music whatsoever.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's just all sound effects.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And like, I couldn't stop grinning. It was just so fucking awesome.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Like Tron awesome? Cause that sounds like something out of Tron.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It was just like, just non-stop action.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Just non-stop, just crazy shit going on.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So I know the movie got like overall good on Rotten Tomatoes.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It seems like the feeling I'm getting on social media is kind of like, it's okay.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, it's like the book. It's like the book.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I mean, that's kinda like what it is.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The book was just, I liked the book. I really liked the book.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But some, you know, my wife who's more sophisticated when it comes to reading, didn't really care for it.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Because it's just kind of, it's like trivia about it.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's like, the way I saw it compared to like, hey, you remember this? Hey, you remember that? Hey, you remember this?

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It wasn't so much that in this. I mean, there was some things.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But they really kinda toned that down from the book.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't know, just like, I don't understand why this gets picked apart.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But like something like, Rampage the movie, you know, it's just, they expect it to be shit.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Did Rampage come out?

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes, it's already out.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, I'm...

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, no, no, no, I'm sorry. No, no, you're right. It's not out yet. It's coming out in a few weeks.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I haven't been paying attention.

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Tomb Raider's out.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, Tomb Raider's out. They're putting it out a little bit.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Which didn't suck, but wasn't great.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Same thing. It was okay.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think, I mean, this is just, it's a really excellent thing.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's kind of, they have like, you know, not to get too much into spoilers and stuff,

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
but like the main guy Sorento in this, he wants to take over the Oasis because he wants to monetize it.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's just like the fucking AAA industry.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He wants to mind it.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We're gonna put ads everywhere.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Like, they're talking about like, oh, hey, this is your VR view or whatever.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sorry, I just have to say, even when I'm not live, the Google thing gets in the way. Sorry.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's three weeks in a row, man.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Sorry, guys. God, I can't, I can't escape the Google chat noise sneaking onto the show.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So like they have like, you know, he's like, yeah, we figured out that it's gonna, we can fill up 82% of the viewers,

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
you know, field of view before they start having seizures is what they're gonna do.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And it's kind of like, yeah, that's kind of like where the industry is going.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So I was kind of neat to like tie in a little bit of like some of the, you know, current stuff.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let me ask this real quick, though, like how many, since it is a gaming show, how many like,

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
is there a lot of video game references?

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Like all over the, just all the time, just all over the fucking place.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So as a gamer, you felt very like fulfilled?

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes, it's very fulfilling.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And like, even if you're not so much a gamer, so there's a, there's plenty of references to it.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's not necessarily reference.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I would call them like cameos and like they incorporate a lot of stuff in there that's from different things.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The rendered characters look like they were straight out of a Final Fantasy game, though.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There's, well, I didn't see any Final Fantasy characters.

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And I mean, granted, the last battle, the last battle scene, like you can't see everything.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Like it's just, there's so much going on that you're going to miss a ton of stuff.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But like there was, I remember spawn was in there, which is awesome.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I did see a cameo of Robocop in there at some point.

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Apparently at the end of the, that the last charge you kind of see in the trailer,

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
they do have, you know, like Tracer and stuff from Overwatch, the Battletoads.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And apparently the Power Rangers are in there as well, like charging.

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So I don't know. And then like the last like battle, which is kind of out of the book,

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
it's just, it's like, I don't want to spoil anything, but it's just like, dude, with that combination, you can't.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
An orgy, an orgy of pop culture references.

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And the end of the battle, Mr. Rogers in a bloodstain sweater.

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh God, I hope that would, movie of the decade.

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny. Remember that, right?

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes. Yes.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's what it sounds like.

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's great.

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No, but it's pretty awesome. And like, I like even like Sorrento's like avatar kind of looks like this bulked up evil Superman type guy,

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
which I don't know if he was like supposed to be like that, but he sort of looked like a Superman type guy.

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Every time you say Sorrento, I think of Sargento and what pizza.

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Pasta sauce. Do they make pasta sauce?

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah. Pasta sauce and cheese. They make cheese.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It was a good movie. I liked it. Um, there was, I don't know, there's not really much I could really pick apart about it.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I mean, it was definitely different than the book because they don't really,

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
well, the big part of the book was like you found the key and then you have to find the gate.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And so there was like a challenge to get to the gate as well.

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is more like you found the key. Okay, now here, open the gate. You know, it's like the gate's right there.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And then the gate's just to get a clue for the next thing.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You know, it's so they don't really kind of address that too much.

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Um, but I liked it. I thought it was a great movie. It's definitely worth seeing.

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And I saw it, I saw it in 3D and in the D box with the motion seats and stuff. That was fucking awesome.

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I forget the motion box is the thing cause I haven't seen a single movie and that's just Tron.

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Tron was eight years ago, or like seven and a half. It was, oh my God, I can't believe how like long ago that was.

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Anyway, uh, we do want to get into the rest of the show tonight.

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Um, before we get too far though, let me tell you what's going on in case you have somehow missed this announcement in previous episodes.

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So maybe it's your first Orange Lounge Radio. You never know.

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Uh, there's people that find us through friends or other methods every week, so hi.

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Uh, it's a little different tonight. This is Orange Lounge Radio unplugged because we are not live.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We usually are live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geeks Network.

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
vog.network.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But this week, April 1st, a little bit different because it's also Easter.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And so we all have Easter family plans, actually.

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Even though mine are in the morning, you guys are in the evening and, you know, Jamie's all the way out in San Francisco.

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So it's just not going to gel together on April 1st.

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm going to have a very, very gay Easter.

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's, I'm kind of jealous. Anyway, um, so, uh, but here's the thing.

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Usually we would just take the night off, but we just had last Sunday off because my fault, I was out of town.

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, really Bobby Black Wolf's fault because he had to go and get married.

162
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But I will say, I'm sure-

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's so overrated.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sure this is going to come up on his show because, um, I'm still going to do the call live on Sunday and I'm sure it'll get brought up.

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But I do want to just, you know, again, congratulate Bobby and Jennifer Black Wolf on their, on their wedding.

166
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And, uh, yes, there were lots of great nerdy references in it.

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Uh, walk down the aisle to the theme from Final Fantasy.

168
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Cool.

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Uh, I remember Kingdom Hearts came up too at some point.

170
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Other nerdy things like Star Wars and like Weird Al kicked off the, the dance.

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Although, speaking of the dance, I will say this about Bobby's wedding.

172
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Did he have a polka?

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He, Bobby, no, it wasn't, it was a tacky, you know?

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But anyway, uh, I will say this about Bobby's wedding because this was a nerdy reference.

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So good.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I didn't even catch it until like Jennifer said, did you, did you notice that?

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And I was like, oh my God, you did.

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh my God, you totally did do that.

180
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So they did this whole thing, like when it was time for them to do the first dance and Bobby kind of like said, oh no, no, no, we weren't going to do that.

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Remember?

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Like he's, no, no, no.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And he's walking up to the DJ and I'm thinking like, oh, this is really awkward.

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Right.

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And then all of a sudden, like Jennifer kind of like pulls him in and the song starts and of course he's like super into it and they do this whole choreographed thing.

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They did the fucking scene from Final Fantasy 8, the ballroom dance scene, and they did the whole, where she pulls him in and all.

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So that was, it was all part of it.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And then like, I know there's video of it somewhere cause there was a camera upstairs.

189
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So I kind of go from that whole like, oh no, like, oh dear, something's going on to that whole like this bitch.

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah.

191
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Like when they get into the whole like thing, but it was, it was fantastic.

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I was like, you could probably even see me in the video mouthing to Alan, what a ham.

193
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But it was great.

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It was so good.

195
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And I love that it was a traditional wedding, but very peppered with nerdy references.

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Like Ready Player One.

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It was peppered with nerdy references.

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I was more excited by that Katamari cake though.

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It was, sadly we didn't get to eat it.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I guess the groom's cake is not necessarily something you eat at the wedding.

201
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's dumb.

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's cake.

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Well, I had never heard of the groom's cake tradition before this wedding.

204
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Cause it's a Southern thing apparently.

205
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I had never heard of it, but yeah, he did have a cake and it's on my Instagram.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's on his Twitter, but the cake looked like a giant Katamari, which was very well done.

207
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But the best part about it, it was rolling up things that were like Bobby.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It was like a microphone and a VR headset and like the, and I thought, oh my God, I love that.

209
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I love that.

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So, but we did get to eat like the cake cake.

211
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't think you'd really call it the bride's cake, but the cake cake.

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It was really fucking good.

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It was good.

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And like, I did not realize this is a thing I learned.

215
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You know, Bobby and I, we do have a lot in common.

216
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We're both longtime internet broadcasters, right?

217
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Uh, but one thing I did not realize we have in common, we both love red velvet.

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And so did you just roll your eyes at me?

219
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's just chocolate, but they dye it red.

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No, it's different.

221
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's different.

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
True red velvet cake is, is a very, very chocolate cake that shines red when the sun hits it.

223
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It was, it was good.

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, I mean, the cake was three layers.

225
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So obviously I had the red velvet layer and I'm pretty sure he did too.

226
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And it was fantastic.

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So anyway, congratulations, Bobby.

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But that's why we weren't here last Sunday live because I did take the trip out to Georgia to do it.

229
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You know what, Bobby, I've, God, I would, Bobby I've known because of this show.

230
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And, you know, obviously he led to the partnership that saved us from live through CC5 when they were kind of imploding and then brought us to the all games.

231
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And then obviously we created VOG, you know, together, you know, with, with our buddies.

232
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And so, God, Bobby's somebody I've worked with and gone to expos, E3 packs, all that stuff over for like 10 years, over 10 years.

233
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So I was very honored that he, he shared in a special day with me, but I will stop talking about that.

234
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Since again, I'm sure the folks that are listening on Sunday night are like, we just heard this on Bobby's show, but it was a great night, y'all.

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It was a great night.

236
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Let's just, so this is unplugged.

237
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's also unplugged because we don't have a show roll.

238
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Usually we have a list like Jamie's going to talk about this and then Loki's going to talk about this.

239
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Like we don't script the show, but we have like, we have a flow chart of how the show is going to look, right?

240
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We didn't do that this week.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
PowerPoint presentation.

242
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We don't have our chat room, which means if we get something wrong tonight, we're not going to be instantly corrected.

243
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Deal with it.

244
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah. You'll just have to send us an email to participate.

245
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Anything wrong is an April Fool's joke.

246
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's right. Very good. Very good. Anything wrong is April Fool's.

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It was intentional.

248
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Got you good. All right.

249
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Let's get into our gaming weeks. Why don't we start off talking about that?

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We usually do at the top of the show, talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

251
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Dark Sakura.

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Since I'm better at reading maps than my husband, I've been his navigator in Breath of the Wild again in our quest to get every single shrine.

253
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We were on the last shrine.

254
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Wow.

255
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The one where you use the giant ball in Impa's house.

256
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I haven't played enough of Breath of the Wild to find them all.

257
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Girl.

258
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Girl.

259
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I need to go back and really like play that game thoroughly.

260
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Well, we were on the last one and then I told Dan that our next quest is to get all 900 Koroks. We have 120.

261
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh boy.

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, you only need 400 and something to fill your inventory to get all the inventory slots, but we're going for completion.

263
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We're doing like everything. Poor Zelda's, they're like, bitch, hurry up in that castle.

264
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And then I'm still playing idle pouring. I'm still playing animal crossing. We've got more animals. It's actually really fun.

265
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Are they still updating the mobile?

266
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, they're still updating it like different things to do every month. Different ways to get your money.

267
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't want to say that game flopped because I know it has its fans.

268
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It didn't flop at all.

269
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But well, but it also didn't hit expectations. I know I've seen that.

270
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Well, I'm helping it hit expectations.

271
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But I mean, I was actually going to say a positive, Jamie, if you let me finish.

272
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The positive was going to be, but they're still updating it. They're still doing all these tweaks to it that I'm just I'm just not hearing about because for whatever reason, it just doesn't have the same.

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I just want a full animal crossing on Switch.

274
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I think you and half the Internet.

275
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Right. Yeah.

276
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And so I've been, you know, living my Animal Crossing fantasy vicariously through, you know, the little teensy Animal Crossing.

277
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Sure. But it's been really fun. I'm super enjoying it.

278
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I've started playing Puzzle Bobble again, the phone version, because it's all I have time for anymore.

279
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I haven't touched Wow, which is sad. I probably should. But I need people to play with.

280
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Hey, Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick from Game Buoy, you out there?

281
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
They would be on the server when I am. But.

282
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's a bummer. It is a bummer about the regional stuff, because I bet the girls gone wow team would love to have you.

283
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And it's a it's a bummer about the whole fact that you can't play with UK people.

284
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah, it is.

285
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But I've I've you know, I've been thinking about putting some time into that once I get some of my responsibilities out of the way, because I even tonight after I go to the movies, I'm supposed to work on, you know, graphic stuff.

286
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But that's been the predominant thing is really I've just been like we've all been about Breath of the Wild at my house.

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, and and and and I played a shit ton of World Cup soccer pinball.

288
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Pinball machine. Yeah, I saw your Instagram lighten up because you replaced a part, right?

289
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Well, Dan hosted League Night. There's there's two leagues in Sacramento. There's the Folsom League and the Lodi League.

290
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What's league like like pinball league?

291
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Oh, I know there was a pinball league. That's cool.

292
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And I think that we had the Lodi League at our house on.

293
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Not this past Thursday, but last week, huh? And like 24 people in the house, so I just went and bought clothes.

294
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm down another gene size. Hey, hey, work.

295
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Anyway, so we they broke my goalie on World Cup soccer.

296
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And the goalie is actually a hard plastic that's mounted to a another metal piece and it moves back and forth.

297
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You can still do the metal piece, but the goalie is a little bit bigger.

298
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's just a big hunk of plastic. And they broke my goalie off of the post.

299
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And so Dan ordered me another goalie, but he jury rigged my my old goalie so that we could still play the table.

300
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And he's put all kinds of LEDs in it. And he's finished Creature from the Black Lagoon, which he we sold one once.

301
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And he always wanted another. So he shopped it out. And now we have the getaway, which was high speed to.

302
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah, I remember that. I actually remember that we have like so many Steve Ritchie tables.

303
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's not even funny. High speed was one of the NES games, right? Like everybody knows him.

304
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I think so. They also did high speed. High speed was the one where you play as the cops.

305
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Well, the getaway is where you play as the guy in the Ferrari.

306
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And so it's another Steve Ritchie game, which the Steve Ritchie games, like, for example, there's Black Knight 2000 is a Steve Ritchie game.

307
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You know, the getaway, the new Star Trek pinball is a Steve Ritchie game and the new Star Wars one.

308
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think he did that one, too. But he does really fast ones with like the button in the middle gimmick.

309
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And so I guess we've become Steve Ritchie collectors.

310
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And he's also a super nice guy, just, you know, going very deaf. But he's really, really just a cool guy.

311
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And so we've been doing a lot of pinball lately, just, you know, Dan shopping out.

312
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We might be selling Star Trek maybe because we need room.

313
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That's part of what you got to do. Buy, sell, trade.

314
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And my coworker and buddy Tyler, who changed roommate, went to L.A. and brought me back to new games.

315
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, new-ish, you know, new to me. I have now Puyo Puyo Dreamcast edition, Puyo Puyo 4 for Dreamcast.

316
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And I have Puyo Puyo Sun 64, which I wanted since that fucking game came out.

317
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And now I have it in a very nice box. It's really nice.

318
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Awesome.

319
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And but I'm still working on finding something for Dan.

320
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So if anyone has any leads on a copy of Salamander Deluxe Pack for Sega Saturn for hopefully under 60 bucks, let me know.

321
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
OK.

322
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So that's it.

323
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
All right.

324
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And as the collecting world turns of the vault to Dark Saga's house.

325
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Well, we might be selling off some of the stuff in there, but the Saturn collection.

326
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're still trying to unload that Ninja Gaiden trilogy, huh?

327
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We haven't really put much effort into it, but if someone wants to make me an offer on Ninja Gaiden trilogy, if it's under $300, I'm going to laugh at you.

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
All right.

329
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's in the box with a manual.

330
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
All right. Let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week? What have you been playing?

331
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I've been playing a few things, so I got Far Cry 5 because I was peer pressured by my.

332
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Well, it's not peer pressured, but I like at least to get the PlayStation 4 version.

333
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I was peer pressured because they're like, you just get a PlayStation 4, then maybe we can play.

334
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And I was like, OK, fine.

335
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Because I wasn't decided between PlayStation 4 or PC.

336
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And I like Far Cry games. They're all right.

337
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And I usually get tired of them pretty fast, but the Far Cry arcade was pretty fun.

338
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So that's kind of the level creator that they have in there.

339
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So I've been messing with that a little bit.

340
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's still kind of limited for what I wanted to make, but I could have quite a bit of fun with that.

341
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And then the actual game itself.

342
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
OK, so there's this weird glitch that happened.

343
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So I was playing the game on normal, and then all of a sudden I'm in the tutorial.

344
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I thought of Bobby for a second there.

345
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I was like, I can't pass the tutorial.

346
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I keep getting shot to death.

347
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And I'm doing everything right. Why do I keep dying so fast?

348
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Well, apparently there's a glitch in the game that all of a sudden randomly sets it up to hard mode.

349
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It just ramps it up all the way.

350
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And I was like, what the hell?

351
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And so I put it all back down the easy.

352
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And I was like, OK, that's way better now.

353
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Now I can actually survive.

354
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But I posted on Twitter, and apparently Travis had the same problem.

355
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
He's like, yeah, that happened to me too.

356
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I was like, that's weird.

357
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But yeah, the game is all sorts of glitchy bullshit, which means I love it.

358
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So there's that.

359
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And then I was actually trying to get some actual programming done.

360
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So I've been doing a lot of stuff, though, for work and doing stuff for something I wanted to work on.

361
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But it's more of education still, because I wanted to do a third-person shooter.

362
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But who would have thought it's so much fucking harder than a first-person shooter?

363
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So speaking of work, a little birdie named the Twitter icon told me that you got a promotion.

364
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yes, I did get a promotion.

365
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
A nice 25% raise too.

366
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's special.

367
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You got money.

368
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah, so I've been trying to get into this specific position ever since I got up to where I'm at now,

369
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
because it seemed like it was really cool.

370
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's basically people that it's sort of like an analyst position,

371
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
but it's basically finding efficiencies and implementing that stuff.

372
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh, like business improvement stuff.

373
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah, so workflow stuff.

374
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
A lot of that is tied to training, so I'm very familiar with that.

375
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah, exactly. So workflow stuff.

376
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And that's kind of what I do anyways.

377
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Any position I go to, I kind of master it, and I find shortcuts that do everything faster.

378
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And so that's how I've gotten great reviews the last couple of years, just because of that kind of stuff.

379
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I started teaching myself JavaScript.

380
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Well, first I started off with Visual Basic scripting to do macros and stuff,

381
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and now since I'm moving out of Internet Explorer, because no one should be in Internet Explorer.

382
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But I wanted to move away from that, so now I'm learning JavaScript to develop a Chrome extension

383
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
to work with the stuff I have, because we use a database system, I guess.

384
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
We call it Salesforce. A lot of big companies use it, Microsoft and stuff like that.

385
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Isn't it built on an Oracle?

386
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's something. I don't know what it is. It's basically a database of contacts and stuff.

387
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
They use it for sales.

388
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I know Salesforce very well, and I know other people that know it very, very well.

389
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's very popular in the industry.

390
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes, there's lots of people that use Salesforce.

391
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
What we wanted to do, there's different quality of life things that obviously aren't going to be at the forefront

392
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
for our programs to work on, because we just integrated.

393
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We moved away from a terminal system into Salesforce,

394
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and so I've been using the extension to build those quality of life functions on the client side

395
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
to do all the things that they want to do, since we don't have to bug the programs.

396
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I can just take care of it myself.

397
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's like, oh, I want this button to do this and this and this.

398
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So in a roundabout way, all this programming stuff for the games you've never done

399
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
have actually kind of helped you out.

400
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah, sort of. It helps me learn different languages a lot quicker, so that's good.

401
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
No, but I really do want to get into making games.

402
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I have been inspired, but the third-person shooter stuff, it seems like it's a lot to learn.

403
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I mean, it's just with the animation systems and stuff like that, but it's good to learn it, though,

404
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
because it's an important part of doing all these different things in Unity and stuff.

405
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So it's good to kind of learn that now instead of just going around different ways of doing things.

406
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So I've been kind of in just a learning phase, and it's been fascinating.

407
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So once I kind of get that down, then I'll start working on some other things.

408
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And I don't even know if the third-person shooter thing is what I'm going to end up doing,

409
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
but it's just more of just educating myself, especially since the last time I used Unity

410
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
was kind of getting into the five, and now it's 2017, and a ton of shit has changed.

411
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So it's just kind of figuring out what all the changes are.

412
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
All right, anything else for your gaming week?

413
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
A little bit of Pokémon, because they have that new quest system thing, so that's been fun.

414
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah, that just started the day we're recording, yeah.

415
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Yeah, so I've been playing that a little bit, and then I've been...

416
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
What else? I played a little bit of Burnout Paradise Remastered, and that's all right.

417
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Kind of sad that they just dropped the price $10, like literally a week after it came out.

418
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh wow, I didn't even realize that.

419
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But I... whatever, it's fine.

420
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So I don't know, I'm just going to be playing stuff.

421
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I've kind of settled on the fact that I'm probably not going to buy any new games until the fall.

422
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
But at the same time, I'm thinking, hey, you know, I just got this new job,

423
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
maybe I should reward myself with a Switch, so we'll see.

424
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I bought two games, actually. One of them I haven't played yet, but I just bought it today.

425
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Have you ever heard of Leo's Fortune?

426
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Nope.

427
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's a little platformer where you play as a green, fuzzy, Muppet-looking ball.

428
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But it got good ratings. It's really pretty.

429
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Cool.

430
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And another one called Human Fall Flat.

431
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That I've seen, yeah.

432
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yeah, I got that one, but I haven't, again, played it yet, but it looks really neat, so...

433
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm trying to do more, like, Mac gaming, because someone's gotta.

434
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Someone's gotta be the audience for that.

435
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But both of them are really high-rated, so I decided to give them a try.

436
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm going to do my gaming week then.

437
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I was traveling most of the time, so I don't have as many games, although I did bring my Switch,

438
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and so I did play some Mario Kart 8 while we had some downtime,

439
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
because I noticed Sunday night there was nothing to do, so I played some Mario Kart 8

440
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and some Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 and a few things on Switch there.

441
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But actually, just a little while ago, I was doing some streaming of Ni No Kuni 2.

442
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I started playing Ni No Kuni 2.

443
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
How is it?

444
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's not bad, and it's not tied to the first one.

445
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It does feel like a different game in the same universe,

446
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
because I noticed right off the bat the combat is completely different.

447
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's more like Kingdom Hearts type of combat than it is a normal RPG where it's like fight, attack, run.

448
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You run up, you can dodge, and it's more action-y kind of based.

449
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So I don't think you have to have a knowledge of the first game, really,

450
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
although I did notice some of the location names are the same, so it must be in the same world,

451
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
although I've only played the first chapter.

452
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I've barely scratched the surface, so not all of that's come together yet.

453
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But I was doing some streaming of that earlier on my channel, Rob Roberts, on Twitch,

454
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
so I was encouraged to play more, so I'll definitely play some more.

455
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It is a really good-looking game. It looks really nice.

456
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I bought it on PC, actually.

457
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I know most people are probably doing it on PlayStation 4.

458
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I felt for streaming it would probably be easier on PC,

459
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and then also I knew PC can run it at some higher resolutions than maybe what I can get away with on my TV.

460
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So yeah, I just decided to get it on PC, and I've been enjoying the game so far,

461
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
so I'm hoping to play more in the coming week.

462
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And again, if you want to watch me play, you can over at Twitch TV, Rob Roberts.

463
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Speaking of Twitch, I've been playing with my buddy Delvin.

464
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Shout-out to Delvin, who's one of the hosts of the Video Game Realness podcast,

465
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
which they're still putting out new episodes out of Toronto,

466
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and we were teaming up playing Overwatch together.

467
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So sometimes I will stream it, like we'll both be streaming it,

468
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and sometimes he streams it, and I'm just like,

469
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Delvin, I'm going to join your game. He's like, okay, so I end up on his stream.

470
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So I've been playing a little more Overwatch because of that,

471
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
which is one of those games I haven't been playing a lot of lately.

472
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But there's a little more renewed interest in Overwatch right now

473
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
because they just put out Brigitte, the new character,

474
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
so it's changed the dynamics a little bit.

475
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So that's fun. I haven't really played a lot of her.

476
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I've still been sticking to the characters that I'm decent with.

477
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I play usually Junkrat. I play Pharah. I play Orisa.

478
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
If the group needs a tank, I really enjoy Orisa.

479
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Do you do tongue pops?

480
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
When I do Orisa?

481
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah.

482
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yes. God!

483
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
What's her catchphrase?

484
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So you play Orisa Edwards and Farah Moan.

485
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Cease your resistance!

486
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I messed up the tongue pop.

487
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I couldn't help it.

488
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Let's see. And then what do I do if I need a healer?

489
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm a pretty decent Mercy.

490
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I still play Mercy, even though they keep thwappin' her with the nerf bat,

491
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
but I still enjoy Mercy.

492
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I sometimes play Lucio, but I think I'm just better with Mercy.

493
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So yeah, that's a little Overwatch,

494
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and I guess that's really all I have to say,

495
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
except I will quickly mention the Pokemon Go things since you brought it up.

496
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
The questing is rad.

497
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
If you haven't played Pokemon Go in a while,

498
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
fire it up because it's cool.

499
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Now you have two types of quests, basically.

500
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
One of them are little daily things you get from bogey stops.

501
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The other one is kind of like this set adventure

502
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
that is going to culminate in the ability to capture Mew, basically.

503
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But what's cool about it is that some of the quest rewards

504
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
is not only another way to get XP

505
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and get some of the stuff you would usually get from raids,

506
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
but you can actually get XP as well,

507
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
so people that need more experience, this is a good way to do it.

508
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And it does throttle you.

509
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
You can only do so much in one day,

510
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
but I got an incubator as the reward today for doing quests,

511
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and I was like, okay.

512
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I always complain about how fast you tear through those incubators,

513
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and then it's just like, buy more, buy more,

514
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and you know that's how they're making all their money,

515
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
so I appreciate that there's ways to get free ones now in the game.

516
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
They used to have it, though.

517
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You can sometimes get them from bogey stops.

518
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Around Christmas, I think.

519
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Was it only at Christmas?

520
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I feel like they might have done it twice in the game.

521
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
There was a couple-day period where every day you spun a bogey stop,

522
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
you got one one-using incubator.

523
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yeah, that's what I like.

524
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
They did that for a bit, yeah.

525
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yeah, so I think it was around the holidays.

526
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So anyway, that is pretty much it for my gaming week.

527
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So we will be back live next week, April the 8th,

528
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
so we will see you then,

529
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and then we should have shows pretty consistently

530
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
until the end of June, the week after our 16th anniversary special.

531
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
My God.

532
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
This show will be old enough to drive right into a brick wall,

533
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
as we do every week.

534
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Well, in Mississippi, we were already old enough.

535
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That's right.

536
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You might even be able to get married in certain states.

537
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That's right.

538
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Are we able to legally consent anywhere yet?

539
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Other countries.

540
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
All right, anyway.

541
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I don't know, it would be old enough in Italy.

542
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Let's get to some gaming news.

543
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Again, we're unplugged tonight,

544
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
so I have no idea what we're going to talk about.

545
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Let's start with Jamie.

546
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Throw a story at us, yeah.

547
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm busy updating my Mac, hush.

548
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So it's a game I actually,

549
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I didn't even know that it was out on iOS,

550
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
so I just acquired it today.

551
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But Puzzle Fighter has actually gotten a rating for PS4,

552
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Xbox One, and PC in Europe,

553
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and it is a translation of the iOS and Google Play version.

554
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So from their little...

555
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Well, we don't know that for sure, though, right?

556
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
We just know the game's been rated.

557
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
We don't know if it's...

558
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Well, yeah, but it's likely...

559
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Because it's not super Puzzle Fighter.

560
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Well, yeah, I guess what I mean by that is

561
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
we don't know if it's going to be the free-to-play model

562
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
or if you'll get a bundle all at once.

563
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Well, the free-to-play model that's out right now

564
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
for its basic features is that you can collect characters,

565
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
you can challenge people all over the world in real-time fighting,

566
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
you have all kinds of Capcom characters,

567
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
you get ranking points,

568
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
you can do world leader board PvP,

569
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
and it's basically just Puzzle Fighter,

570
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
which is funny because I knew two of the people

571
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
who did localization for Puzzle Fighter in the U.S.

572
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Oh, cool.

573
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
The original Puzzle Fighter.

574
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
If I am... Well, actually, was it Puzzle...

575
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
No, it was Rival...

576
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I think it was Puzzle Fighter and Rival Schools.

577
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
That was Chris Tang.

578
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Oh.

579
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It was in DDR.

580
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

581
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Cool guy.

582
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Beat the shit out of my husband in Street Fighter.

583
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The thing I remember about Puzzle Fighter,

584
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I didn't play the mobile one very long

585
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
because you know how I feel about playing games

586
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
that I need a controller for on mobile.

587
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And that is one of those games.

588
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So I'm excited to hear I will get to try it

589
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
with a controller with this.

590
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But one thing I liked about it was that it wasn't just

591
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
the Street Fighter and Darkstalkers,

592
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
but they were putting things like Dante

593
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
and like other Capcom...

594
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Frank West, who's in everything.

595
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah, other Capcom classic greats.

596
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
He needs something to do since his series is dead.

597
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Yeah, that's too bad, huh?

598
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I bet you that series comes back.

599
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's dead, rising.

600
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It will rise from its grave.

601
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Rise from your grave.

602
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Rise from your grave.

603
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It will come out again, I'm sure, at some point.

604
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
To register participation for this week's episode

605
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.

606
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Use the passphrase, graphic.

607
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Reboots, that's what we do in entertainment.

608
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Remasters.

609
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Remaster, reboots.

610
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh, a trilogy remaster.

611
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Why the fuck not?

612
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Let's do it.

613
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Everything else is getting a trilogy remaster.

614
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
All right, Loki, we'll bounce back and forth here.

615
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I don't have anything else.

616
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
All right.

617
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I'll just direct traffic.

618
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Let's find something interesting to talk about.

619
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Well, since we were just talking about Capcom,

620
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
we can talk about, I guess,

621
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Edition.

622
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Oh, sure.

623
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So, yeah, that's gonna be pre-ordering on PC,

624
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

625
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And if you pre-order it,

626
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
you get Ultra Street Fighter IV for free.

627
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And then Switch, of course,

628
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
since Ultra Street Fighter IV wasn't on there,

629
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
you get the Super Street Fighter II,

630
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
the tournament battle.

631
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Hmm.

632
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So, it's pretty awesome.

633
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Except for the fact that I already have

634
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
that Ultra Street Fighter IV on PC, but...

635
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
But it has a meaning.

636
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's got Street Fighter, Street Fighter II,

637
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Street Fighter II Championship Edition,

638
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting,

639
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Super Street Fighter II,

640
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Super Street Fighter II Turbo,

641
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Street Fighter Alpha,

642
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Alpha II, Alpha III,

643
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Street Fighter III,

644
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
III Second Impact.

645
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Street Fighter 33 and a third.

646
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Everything up until fourth.

647
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I don't see any of those bootleg ones.

648
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Where's the Black Belt Edition, dammit?

649
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I want to be able to throw rapid-fire fireballs

650
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
and have them wave up and down.

651
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Where's the one that did all the urban legend shit

652
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
where, like, you could stick Vega to the wall

653
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
and you could handcuff somebody to Guile?

654
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
True story.

655
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Arcade that I used to go to in college

656
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
that was actually in the back of a bar

657
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
had all those bootleg modded ones,

658
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
including Immortal Combat

659
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
that started off with the last fight.

660
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Oh, weird.

661
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Yeah, but I've seen some of those,

662
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
like, urban legend editions,

663
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
the ROM hacked ones.

664
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
They're pretty funny.

665
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah, where, like, somebody will be like,

666
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
no, I swear I saw it once.

667
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Guile handcuffs somebody to him.

668
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Like, it's a move you can do.

669
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And it's like, well, because you saw some bootleg

670
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
from another country.

671
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But back then we weren't aware of,

672
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
we were naive to such things.

673
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
We could have the internet.

674
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah, that's right.

675
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
There was no Snopes.

676
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
We barely had the internet.

677
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That's right.

678
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Get off my lawn.

679
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
All right.

680
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Well, that'd be cool.

681
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I mean, we talked a little bit about

682
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
the Street Fighter thing last week

683
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
or the week before, I don't remember,

684
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
about the whole, like, the tournament.

685
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And that must be the thing

686
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
that they're putting on the Switch,

687
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
but that's cool about the pre-order bonuses.

688
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I mean, like, if you somehow missed

689
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Ultra Street Fighter IV,

690
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
which I don't...

691
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Street Fighter IV feels so much like

692
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Street Fighter II to me,

693
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
because, like, all the Street Fighter II characters

694
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
are in Street Fighter IV.

695
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah.

696
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Every single one of them.

697
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The last good one.

698
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Yeah.

699
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So, anyway.

700
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You weren't a fan of Street Fighter V?

701
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Apparently not a lot of people were.

702
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Well, I don't know.

703
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I want to give it a second chance

704
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
of this arcade edition.

705
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
My girl's in it.

706
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Dan played a little bit of it.

707
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It was actually not too bad.

708
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Yeah.

709
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I only care because I can play soccer right now.

710
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I want to give it another look.

711
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Anyway, what do you have for us, Jamie?

712
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Some Dragon Quest stuff.

713
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Because, guess what?

714
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's not 9.

715
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It's 11.

716
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Sorry.

717
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
That was from before the show.

718
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
When it's XI, it's 11.

719
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yes.

720
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's me, Si.

721
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
IX is 9.

722
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yes.

723
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
X.

724
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
But, yeah.

725
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
G.

726
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's Final Fantasy.

727
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Or, not Final Fantasy.

728
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Dragon Quest G.

729
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
G.

730
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Anyway.

731
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
They...

732
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Uh...

733
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Deh.

734
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So, on September 4th,

735
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Dragon Quest XI Echoes of an Elusive Age,

736
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
and also Echoes of an Elusive Game,

737
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
will be coming out on PlayStation 4 and PC on Steam in North America and Europe.

738
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
We will also receive a Switch version, but it will not be finished for a little while.

739
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But, then again, we're also not getting the 3DS version,

740
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
because, apparently, Squeenix wants to avoid dividing its focus.

741
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So, whatever.

742
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,000
But, hey, at least we're getting support for Dragon Quest games, you know, officially now.

743
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's gonna be nice to get Dragon Quest XI, seeing as Dragon Quest X never happened.

744
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Now, I get Dragon Quest X as online, but it would've been nice.

745
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It would've been nice.

746
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It apparently will have all the pomp it's meant to have, so...

747
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Huzzah.

748
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'll definitely be picking that up.

749
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
See America, this face?

750
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Yeah.

751
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It tells you everything you need to know.

752
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Even though this is radio, we cannot see this face.

753
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Dot com.

754
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Alright, Logie.

755
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So, they're making a Carmen Sandiego movie for Netflix.

756
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Yeah.

757
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Who's Carmen Sandiego? That's the most important part.

758
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Jennifer Lopez?

759
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Gina Rodriguez.

760
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
That's not bad.

761
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Who was in Annihilation.

762
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Oh, okay.

763
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I didn't realize they actually cast somebody. Okay.

764
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Sure.

765
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So, that's gonna be a live action movie.

766
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And, then, also, apparently, they're gonna be doing another animated project that's coming out.

767
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
A series that's in 2019.

768
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
She'll be doing the voice of Carmen Sandiego for that as well.

769
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Well, that's cool. They kind of do that to tie it together.

770
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I wonder, is it gonna be geared towards kids then?

771
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Like, even if they're doing a Carmen Sandiego movie, are they gonna kind of gear it towards kids?

772
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I mean, it does say it's gonna be triple X, so, I mean, yes, I assume it's gonna be geared towards kids.

773
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Triple X art core?

774
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Where in my butt is Carmen Sandiego?

775
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
No, I think they're gonna do a kids version.

776
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I wonder if they'll bring characters to the game show.

777
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Like, they'll have the ch- I mean, honestly, obviously, rest in peace, Lin.

778
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Thigpen is not able to be the chief, but maybe they will have, you know, the same style that she did.

779
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
They'll have, like, a chief of police. Maybe they'll bring over some of the stuff.

780
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Maybe the theme song will be that doo-wop, doo-ba-doo-ba-boo-wop.

781
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I doubt it.

782
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It needs to be the ending credits.

783
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I think the big climatic final scene in the Carmen Sandiego movie needs to be somebody putting together a map of, like, what was the heart of Africa?

784
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Or, like, one of those countries or one of those continents where, like, it was really hard.

785
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Like, when the kid got, like, when the kid got, like, the states in America, that was always easy, right?

786
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
They would just breeze right through that.

787
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
But when they got, like, Europe or Africa, it was, like, really hard.

788
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And they couldn't do it in an amount of time.

789
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You thought it was hard?

790
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
No, I didn't say I thought it was hard.

791
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Like, when they had to, like, name places there or something?

792
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
No, like, you remember the big map on the floor?

793
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
That's right, that's right, that's right.

794
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And they have to fill in the map.

795
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But, like, some people, you know, and even- God, if you asked me to do it today, I don't know if I would.

796
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I don't know if I would. I wouldn't be able to do it in two minutes or whatever the time limit is.

797
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I would have to really think it through.

798
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Well, countries today, though, are not what the countries were then.

799
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
True.

800
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And, I mean, it's serious that borders, you know, change.

801
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That is true.

802
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
All the time.

803
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
That is true. But, you know, still.

804
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Okay, if you had to name, like, if you had to point in an empty map of Africa and name every country, would you be able to do it?

805
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Because I don't think I could.

806
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
No.

807
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I'd get South Africa.

808
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I'd get a good chunk. I'd get a pretty good chunk.

809
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Like, I can pretty much name most of the coasts.

810
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yeah.

811
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
That's me, too. I could probably do all the coastal countries. Yeah.

812
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Yeah.

813
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And, like, Northern Africa, I could probably do better because it would be Egypt, Lebanon, all that. Yeah.

814
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
But, no.

815
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Even Europe. Even Europe, I doubt I could do. Or South America. Actually-

816
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Rob, where is Luxembourg?

817
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Germany?

818
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Luxembourg is a country.

819
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I could do-

820
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
So it's not in Germany?

821
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I could do South-

822
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Y'all need education, okay?

823
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I could do South America.

824
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,000
All right. Well, that, what Carmen Sandiego was how I was getting my education and it's gone, Dar Sakura. It's gone.

825
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Well, I didn't do it.

826
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
All right.

827
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Girl.

828
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You did, though.

829
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

830
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
All right, when-

831
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I am innocent.

832
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
When is the release of Carmen Sandiego on Netflix?

833
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
They haven't said yet. Other than the animated series, which is in 2019, they haven't said when the movie's coming out yet, so-

834
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You may get us wait.

835
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I think we need to see a trailer first before-

836
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yes.

837
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Unless they pull, like, you know, hey, here's Carmen Sandiego. But they can't do that because we don't know where Carmen Sandiego is, so, you know, they can't show us that.

838
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You know, I always had this theory when I was playing the games as a kid that Carmen Sandiego was a code name for a big organization, that it wasn't a single person.

839
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I was getting into this conspiracy theory shit when I was eight.

840
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Eight.

841
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
You? You?

842
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Me.

843
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
All right. Anyway, what do you have for us? Another story.

844
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
What, me? Me?

845
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah, you.

846
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Ikaruga.

847
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Mm-hmm.

848
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Which isn't Radiant Silver Gun. I want Radiant Silver Gun.

849
00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Anyway, the German USK has a rated Ikaruga for PlayStation 4 being, of course, developed again by Treshar. Treasure.

850
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And so, I'm trying to get what they said, though, the date on it, because the stupid thing isn't listing the date.

851
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Wait, these are the-

852
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
This says it's rated, so no date on it.

853
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
The German USK?

854
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Yeah.

855
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Is that in Luxembourg?

856
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Fuck off.

857
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I'll show you Luxembourg when I kick you over there.

858
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Fuck off.

859
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But yeah, Ikaruga is once again being released on yet another system, as if you didn't already play Ikaruga on, what was it?

860
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
All of the other systems.

861
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Dreamcast, yeah, it came out in the arcade, then we had Dreamcast, GameCube, Xbox 360, and PC.

862
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
When is someone gonna demake Ikaruga for the 2600?

863
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
That's what we need to plan on.

864
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Would it kill Treasure to do a new shooter? I mean, to be fair-

865
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Would it kill Treasure to do a new silhouette mirage?

866
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And to be fair, to be fair, new shooter games are coming out all the time in Japan, and so few of them make it over here, and I don't follow the genre close enough.

867
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I'm sure I will get tweets like, Rob, there's been all these shooter games you don't even know about, and yeah, because they don't ever seem to come over here.

868
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Like, it's just not- the genre does not-

869
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
For a little while we were getting, like, some of them, like, when we got Death Smiles and-

870
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I would think the-

871
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Mushi Himesama and-

872
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
The Switch would be such a good system for those.

873
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It would.

874
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Because you can flip it vertically, like, in the, um, Pinball FX3, it has a vertical mode, and you can hold-

875
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah.

876
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Yeah, and, like, that would be fucking great for shmups, but for whatever reason we just don't have a lot yet, but maybe soon.

877
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And the Switch is region free, so-

878
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
How very dear they are.

879
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Where is that?

880
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
But, cool, Ikaruga on PlayStation 4, why not? Why not? Let's do it again.

881
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Ikaruga.

882
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Why not? We did Rez again, let's do Ikaruga again.

883
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
How about, just, somebody give me Radiant Silver Gun on Saturn, and I'll shut up about Ikaruga.

884
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Alright. Uh, Logi.

885
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Alright, so, there's this article that was about, um, I guess this Windows Core OS, which is, I guess, the next step for Windows 10, or kind of a tweak to it.

886
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So, what they're going to be doing with this, basically, I guess they're saying, Microsoft Windows Vision, which includes the idea of a gaming mode for playing games with an Xbox controller.

887
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And, um, you know, they're talking about some of the features.

888
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Windows Seashell, it says, with the same kernel, a flexible core, and a unified app platform, the last piece of the shell, or UI, that itself can adapt to the screen.

889
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Taking the idea of continuum to the OS level, Seashell lets devices adjust their UIs for different tasks and experiences.

890
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:39,000
A device running full Windows 10 for desktop would be able to take on a Windows 10 mobile UI to run in phone mode.

891
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Or, for example, a Windows 10 PC could take on the Xbox UI when in gaming mode.

892
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:56,000
This means that we'll see an Xbox UI come to Windows 10, and this means we'll be able to launch Xbox games through this UI.

893
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:07,000
This also means that we'll see third-party Xbox PC consoles, um, if the OEM wants to use the native Windows 32 support or not.

894
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:25,000
An OEM can create an Xbox PC console with S mode enabled, which has native Windows 32 compatibility, and can switch between normal Windows 10, or can be based on Polaris, which has no native Windows 32, and based on the universal Windows platform.

895
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
They're not going to make such happen.

896
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,000
This also means, um, the future, we could see Xbox hardware that comes with a controller and a mouse and keyboard.

897
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Hmm.

898
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So that they're going to turn the Xboxes into PCs, and the PCs into Xboxes.

899
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Interesting.

900
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Um, and being that, you know, with that, there's also the possibility that, um, with this universal Windows platform and this special shell that maybe, since they're going to be running Windows 10, that you can get Steam games for your Windows, or your Xbox console.

901
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So essentially they're just trying to make, like, the Xbox console basically a PC on your television at this point.

902
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Almost.

903
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Steam box, basically.

904
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Yeah.

905
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Interesting.

906
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I haven't heard a lot about Steam boxes.

907
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Interesting.

908
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:19,000
But my thing with this, and like, don't get me wrong, it sounds exciting, but I remember talking with a Microsoft rep back in 2012 about this type of thing, and they were like, oh yeah, it's right around the corner.

909
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So...

910
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Well, the games for Windows thing was like a very, like, Xbox 360 kind of shell around games.

911
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
You know?

912
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And there was stuff, of course...

913
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It was a terrible shell.

914
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I got to pour one out for Game Room, because I'm always going to bring up Game Room, but that was one of those things that, you know, it had that you could play it on both sides, and it would remember who you are, and it had that same type of shell on it, you know?

915
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Was it just ahead of its time, Loki?

916
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Yes, I guess so.

917
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But, I mean, that's a neat idea.

918
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I'd be really interested to hear more about it and see when it's going to be implemented, because right now it's just kind of talk.

919
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I mean, I'm hopeful that they'll do something.

920
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I maybe need to see more Xbox integration, even more reason not to buy an Xbox One.

921
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
It's kind of confusing.

922
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:15,000
But I guess if they're still able to sell Xbox One games on PC, then does it really matter that they're not selling consoles that they don't make anything off of?

923
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Well, I think they're still selling enough Xboxes.

924
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:27,000
The question is, when they do implement this, and we're buying lots of Xbox One games, am I going to have to pay for Xbox One or Xbox Live Gold?

925
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Because they're, oh, well, now you have to.

926
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Whereas, no, we don't.

927
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Who knows?

928
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:44,000
But that's going to be hard to sell on a platform that can, you know, yeah, I could buy this game here, or I could buy the Steam version, which doesn't have to do that.

929
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
We'll see.

930
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Maybe E3 will have some answers, but probably not.

931
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It just really sounded like their whole press release there was full of wind.

932
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Like, oh, we're going to talk about kernels, as if we're Linux.

933
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
No.

934
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
We got one more from you, right, Jamie?

935
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

936
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I'm sorry, I'm just completely unimpressed with Microsoft bullshit.

937
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So, 2018 World Video Game Hall of Fame finalists.

938
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
If there are the finalists listed, you can still vote for them.

939
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Wait, where is this?

940
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Oh, this is the Video Game Hall of Fame.

941
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Yeah, the Strongs World Video Game Hall of Fame.

942
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Yeah, this does come up every year.

943
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Okay.

944
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Yeah, and you can vote for it.

945
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
You have to look for the website.

946
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:37,000
But the voting closes on, well, the inductees will be announced on Thursday, May 3rd, at 1030.

947
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
So, you can vote for the following.

948
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Asteroids, Call of Duty from 2003, Dance Dance Revolution, Final Fantasy VII, Half-Life, John Madden Football,

949
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
King's Quest, Metroid, Minecraft, Ms. Pac-Man, Space War, and Tomb Raider.

950
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And if you don't vote for DDR, I'm disowning you.

951
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I thought they already had Minecraft in there.

952
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Maybe it was just nominated before.

953
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It was a finalist from before.

954
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Here's the thing. I went, and you can actually pull a Wiki article on all this.

955
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It's located in Rochester, New York.

956
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And if you want to vote, worldvideogamehalloffame.org.

957
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Here's the class of 20...

958
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Wait a second. I thought that there was another hall of fame somewhere else in the Midwest.

959
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Are you thinking of the one, the classics in Otumwa or whatever that town is, or all the 80s?

960
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Something like that, where they were saying like, oh, we're the center of video games.

961
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
That's Twin Galaxy's thing.

962
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
No, that wasn't Twin Galaxy's. It was some like...

963
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Are you to say that there is more than one place claiming that they're the hall of fame of video games?

964
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Back in the day, the Metreon had that walk of fame, right?

965
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Well, we're the video game hall of fame now, bitches.

966
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
All right. Anyway, Loki, the one in Rochester, New York.

967
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Okay, so in 2015, they inducted Doom, Pac-Man, Pong, Super Mario Brothers, Tetris, World of Warcraft.

968
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Minecraft was a nominee. It was not inducted.

969
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So that's the difference.

970
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It's like how, what's the band that over and over again never gets into the Music Hall of Fame?

971
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Boston? No, Boston made it.

972
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
There was some band that was getting nominated every fucking year and wasn't getting in.

973
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Was it Black Sabbath?

974
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I bet it was Black Sabbath. I could be wrong, though. Don't quote me on that.

975
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:29,000
2016 had the inductees were the original Legend of Zelda, the Oregon Trail, The Sims, Sonic the Hedgehog, Space Invaders, and Grand Theft Auto 3.

976
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And then in 2017, they inducted Pokemon Red and Green, or Blue, depending on what country you're in.

977
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Street Fighter 2, Donkey Kong, and Halo.

978
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So that's where it is right now.

979
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So now, yes, they have some holdover finalists, but there are some new finalists, which include Dance Dance Revolution.

980
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Although, I gotta be honest, how many do you get to vote for on this list?

981
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Three? Four?

982
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
If I had to vote for four, I would vote for King's Quest, Metroid.

983
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I'm looking at the list. King's Quest, Metroid. Yeah, I'd vote for DDR for me.

984
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
DDR and... I might do Minecraft. I don't know.

985
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But that's my opinion. I'm sure everybody else has theirs.

986
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I'd vote for DDR, DDR, DDR, and Metroid.

987
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Alright.

988
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I don't know, I'd probably give Final Fantasy VII a mention, just because I played a shit ton of that game.

989
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Yeah, because you had to watch Aerith Die over and over.

990
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Well, yeah, that too. But it really was kind of a genre changer. You know, really it was.

991
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:39,000
People, you know, I don't care if you hate or love the game, it has to be admitted that it changed things for RPGs.

992
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
It was a moment.

993
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It was a moment. We were all a little verklempt.

994
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Especially when I watch Aerith Die. I'm happy verklempt.

995
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Let's do one more from Loki and then we'll do the classic game of the week.

996
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Alright. Let's see. How about we talk about Lindsay Lohan?

997
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
How about no?

998
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Is she still in rehab?

999
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I don't know, but Lindsay Lohan...

1000
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
No, she's like the official spokesperson for like Lawyer.com or something now.

1001
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Well, it's a good thing that she is a spokesperson for Lawyer.com, because I'm sure she's utilized them quite a bit.

1002
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
To sue Grand Theft Auto for...

1003
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Again?

1004
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
No, I think it's the same lawsuit. It's been that long. Yes, that's right.

1005
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:29,000
So this lawsuit was basically, for those who don't remember, it was in regards to some of the artwork and characters that were in Grand Theft Auto 5.

1006
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Mainly, I don't remember the name, Lacey Jonas, who was in the game.

1007
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And she was kind of like this, you know, stall...

1008
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:49,000
There's like a Hollywood, you know, young, you know, kind of TMZ trashy celebrity person.

1009
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,000
You know, where she was, you know, had a sex tape and like getting in accidents for being drunk and stuff like that.

1010
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And apparently they're saying, oh, you know, because the artwork has, you know, this blonde chick in a bikini that, you know, Lindsay Lohan has also worn a bikini.

1011
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
But let me guess, parody is acceptable and it's parody.

1012
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Yeah, basically they said that, you know, that her complaint that was, you know, lookalike and it looked exactly like her.

1013
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:31,000
But unfortunately they said that, you know, didn't find that the computer generated images, avatars or NPCs can legally be called portraits.

1014
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And so they said that Jonas wasn't a portrait of Lohan.

1015
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
So apparently, you know, that's been dismissed.

1016
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And yes, she is officially the new spokesperson for Lawyer.com, which makes this whole thing ironic.

1017
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's like Ray.

1018
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
So, I mean, just get over it, dude.

1019
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I mean, like what? That game came out like how many years ago was that?

1020
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
A little bit now.

1021
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
We're getting ready for Grand Theft Auto 6, although we got to get through it.

1022
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's like we got to get through Red Dead 2 first.

1023
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
2010, maybe.

1024
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I think it was a while ago.

1025
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
All right.

1026
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Well, let's let's travel.

1027
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Let's travel back to simpler times, shall we?

1028
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Let's step into the gaming vault and go back to a simpler time when Lindsay Lohan was getting Golden Globe nominations for the parent trap.

1029
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
When she was in Mean Girls.

1030
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
But she was a hot redhead.

1031
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Yeah.

1032
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Well, she was like seven in the parent trap.

1033
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
No, I'm not talking about then.

1034
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I'm talking about later when she was, you know, a hot redhead, not a tiny child.

1035
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Thank you for clarifying.

1036
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
All right.

1037
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's the classic game of the week.

1038
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And once a week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks, hey, Bratz, play this game.

1039
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Put down your Bratz and play this game.

1040
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I'll whip you.

1041
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Whip it good.

1042
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And that's a pun because it ties into this classic game of the week.

1043
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Which pick Dark Soccer?

1044
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I picked Akuma Joe Dracula, as in the version specifically that came out on the Sharp X68000, which was re-released as Castlevania Chronicles.

1045
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:18,000
But this one in particular was notable because the game, well, first of all, the original release date in Japan, which it only came out in Japan, was July 23rd, 1993.

1046
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And the X68000, as I've covered last year in our classic console, the games ran on floppies.

1047
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,000
They were, you know, pretty much Capcom put a lot of games on them because they were pretty much arcade perfect.

1048
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
But it was a really, really good system, good computer system.

1049
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:47,000
So it was based off of the original Castlevania, which in return was also almost simultaneously released as the MSX2's Vampire Killer.

1050
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
So they were all kind of the same game.

1051
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,000
But it had a new engine that was designed to take full advantage of the Sharp X68000 software.

1052
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
It was completely updated and all the stages were re-designed.

1053
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Brand new stages included.

1054
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
All the special items, sub-weapons.

1055
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
A rare item called the Laurel, which fills six health blocks for ten hearts.

1056
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And it also was really fucking hard.

1057
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I've played an emulated version of it. It was pretty hard.

1058
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
You also have the hidden items, the different one-ups, all kinds of stuff in it.

1059
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
It's a Castlevania game.

1060
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,000
But it also did get harder the more you played it too.

1061
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:43,000
It even had, you know, different things going on with it when the later editions came out with the Castlevania Chronicles included more goodies in it.

1062
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
But I'm still focusing on the original.

1063
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
So the musical of the X68000 also had new arrangements for a lot of the music.

1064
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Because one of the advantages that the X68000 had is that you could choose different sound modules.

1065
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:05,000
So you could use the FM synthesizer, a MIDI roll in LA, and you could also use a MIDI roll in GS.

1066
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:12,000
So it also had a hidden general MIDI module that was of course not in the re-release of Castlevania Chronicles.

1067
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And so the instrumentation would vary depending on which of the sound modules that you would use with it.

1068
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:26,000
And I mean, it was just a really great game. Very fucking difficult.

1069
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:34,000
But of course, it did get re-released all over the world later on as Castlevania Chronicles.

1070
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And it did include some other stuff.

1071
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Although in the Japanese version, unlike the English versions, the hardware selection screen would appear automatically when you played in original mode the same way it did on Akuma Joe Dracula for X68000.

1072
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
You have to use a special code to get it on the American ones.

1073
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:06,000
But it was, I mean, I was very happy that the game did get a re-release eventually because the X68000, I mean, it was number one only out in Japan.

1074
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Even getting one of those systems is super expensive.

1075
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And, you know, on top of it, it's just a really awesome game.

1076
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
You know, one that a lot of people missed out on.

1077
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
So is Castlevania Chronicles that different, or is it like, if I play Castlevania Chronicles, I'm pretty much playing?

1078
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Castlevania Chronicles does have the original version in it.

1079
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
It also does have an arranged and updated version.

1080
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Oh, okay.

1081
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And I'm actually really sad because it needed more information for the original release of it, and sadly my normal resource doesn't have everything I needed.

1082
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
But, because the Castlevania Chronicles is actually a full port, but it also did add some other features and an arranged mode.

1083
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:57,000
But it's, just playing the original version of it, you'd get a really strong appreciation for just what a good, solid Castlevania game is.

1084
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And I feel like there's a lot in here too that is influenced back and forth.

1085
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Like the stage two that they're playing now, this looks very similar to a stage in Super Castlevania.

1086
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Like there's, I mean, obviously like every Castlevania game that was a side-scroller kind of has that same first stage with the white walls where you fight the bat at the end.

1087
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
The first going into the castle.

1088
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Yeah, you get a lot of deviation in the games after that.

1089
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:28,000
And like I noticed the stage two, the underground stage, there's a stage very similar to this in, complete with the falling rocks and everything that was in Super Castlevania IV.

1090
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,000
So it's kind of interesting, you see, when Super Castlevania IV would have been around that same era, right?

1091
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Super Nintendo was what, 91, 92?

1092
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Yeah, this is 93.

1093
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Yeah, so clearly there's stuff that influenced each other in it. So just kind of neat.

1094
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I'm checking the Castlevania realm, which is another site they get a lot of Castlevania information from.

1095
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
But this just has the character list on it. We play as Simon Belmont.

1096
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And I'm trying to get the producer and composer information on this one because the remake was produced by Igarashi.

1097
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
But yeah, I'm not finding what I need on this one.

1098
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Sadly, and this is also what I get for thinking of it on the way here, but I mean the game when it came out, you want to know how big the game was?

1099
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
2.4 megabytes.

1100
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Jeez.

1101
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Right?

1102
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:33,000
That's nothing by today's standards, but then again also like Atari 2600 games were 4 kilobytes.

1103
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Here we go. Here's an interview with the developer. And that was Ueda Hideo of Konami was the developer of it.

1104
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And I love the box art for it. The original artwork has like the kind of western style artwork. You know how you got the behind the head view of Simon?

1105
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
This is like the front view with the whip going out.

1106
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So the artwork is really awesome. This is actually a pretty good article. I read it a while back.

1107
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:12,000
But it was talking about how they wanted to take advantage of the new stuff the X68000 could do to put out the game that they originally wanted to make.

1108
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:20,000
And so it's just really awesome. And it also does offer differences for the other versions of the Sharp X systems.

1109
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Like the X68030 has a few other, has smoother animation in it for example.

1110
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So they actually put it out to where it would run fluidly on the multiple Sharp systems. So it's pretty neat.

1111
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Cool. There it is. Your classic game of the week. Akumajo Dracula for the X68000. But most of you probably just know it as Castlevania Chronicles.

1112
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Yeah and if you're playing Castlevania Chronicles you just should play Dracula X anyway.

1113
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Alright. There it is. Your classic game of the week. Thank you Darcy. I can never resist a good Castlevania game.

1114
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
We've had a lot of them as classic games of the week but that's because they're all pretty good.

1115
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Yeah and the other one I picked that we had already done.

1116
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I know you're getting to that point. I'll just say when you sent me the text you said Salamander for the other one.

1117
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I was like did you know? That was episode 350. That means that was over 400 episodes ago that you picked that game.

1118
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
But how are you going to remember that far back? Thank god we have the wiki.

1119
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
And I was picking a game without the wiki to rely on.

1120
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I was quite literally in my car about to leave work and I was like oh here's a game. I don't think I've done this one.

1121
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I know I've done some of the others but I don't think I've done this one.

1122
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
But thankfully they keep putting new ones out.

1123
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I'm just going to start doing classic pinball.

1124
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
With our little 10 year rule more and more games become eligible.

1125
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Yeah I already got one for my next pick that I'm going to do.

1126
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Oh good. I have to think about that.

1127
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Whenever that is.

1128
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Usually it's easy for me because I just picked something from the Commodore 64 because she doesn't have that same attachment that I do.

1129
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
You know what I played the most of on the Commodore 64? Centipede.

1130
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Okay good. Me too.

1131
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I want that fucking C64 Mini. In fact I need to see if they're up.

1132
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I know backers of their little whatever they did to Kickstarter or something.

1133
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
We're getting those because somebody either posted on our Discord.

1134
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Shout out to the VoG Network Discord.

1135
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
VoGnetwork.com slash Discord.

1136
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Somebody either posted there or on my Facebook. I don't remember where.

1137
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
But Ashley is showing that the Mini is going out and it's getting reviews.

1138
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I fucking want one. They're awesome.

1139
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I tried to find you a real one.

1140
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Aww.

1141
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I tried.

1142
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
My dad has one. He's tried to give it to me but it's been out in the garage for I don't know how long. It's not going to work.

1143
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Actually, Dan fixed my ColecoVision.

1144
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Really?

1145
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,000
And he just took it apart, cleaned it up, did some new soldering to it.

1146
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Works great.

1147
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Maybe it will work. We'll see.

1148
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
As long as the CRT works the components can be fixed.

1149
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And you can add your own games to it.

1150
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Yeah, that's true. Well, with the Minis I think you can do that too.

1151
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1152
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
So yeah, the Minis, the nice thing about the Minis is they have HDMI's.

1153
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
So it's easier in that regard.

1154
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I'm still wanting a Vectrex.

1155
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I'd love to add a Vectrex to that.

1156
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Had one, wasn't worth it.

1157
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Alright, let's before we go over to the rest of the news from this week from Loki,

1158
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
why don't we travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1159
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I don't know if you're ready for that, Loki.

1160
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Yeah, I've only got one so it should be easy.

1161
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
So this week we've got a game called Penny Punching Princess on the Nintendo Switch and Vita.

1162
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
That sounds amazing.

1163
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Sounds pretty amazing. What are you doing Penny Punching Princess?

1164
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I have no idea.

1165
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
You punch pennies?

1166
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Or do you punch the princess?

1167
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
That's not okay though.

1168
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
She's a cheapskate.

1169
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Unless she's into that.

1170
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
So that sadly, that's all we've got.

1171
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Wow.

1172
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I've only got two in the UK.

1173
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
April is usually a pretty light month.

1174
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Japan's looking a little slow too.

1175
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I was going to say traveling over to Japan.

1176
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Watch Dogs 2 gets a price reduction on the Playstation 4.

1177
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So there's that.

1178
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And then you go over to the Nintendo Switch.

1179
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
The Phantasy Star Online 2 Cloud.

1180
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
That is out on April 4th.

1181
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
So that's pretty exciting.

1182
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Why do we not have this?

1183
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Don't fucking get me started.

1184
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I'm so pressed about this.

1185
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
You could make a panini.

1186
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I am so pressed.

1187
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
That's really it though.

1188
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Yeah, it's a very big game.

1189
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
But I had to look up this penny punching princess thing.

1190
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And it looks like these little princesses have these big iron fists.

1191
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And they punch monsters and coins fall out.

1192
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Oh, coins.

1193
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Yeah.

1194
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And then there's a calculator involved somehow I would assume.

1195
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
With all the pennies that you're collecting.

1196
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
So there you go.

1197
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Anyway, what about you Dark Soccer with Europe?

1198
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Two things.

1199
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Time Carnage on April 6th and The American Dream on April 6th.

1200
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Which looks like a bunch of violent Americans in the 50s with guns.

1201
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So that's it.

1202
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Alright.

1203
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Let's do a few more.

1204
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
By the way, we're going to roll our mailbag over to next week.

1205
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
So we'll be answering your emails live.

1206
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us an email for next week.

1207
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
But we do have a few more news stories from Loki.

1208
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Yeah, we can talk about some quick stuff.

1209
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
So the PlayStation VR bundle got a price drop this week.

1210
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I saw that.

1211
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
$100 cheaper now.

1212
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I might finally have to jump in on that.

1213
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
So you can get like the camera and everything.

1214
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I already have the camera.

1215
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I think though it's separate though.

1216
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I think you can get it without the camera and stuff and it's like $239.

1217
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
So I don't know.

1218
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I'd have to check.

1219
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
But I still need the move.

1220
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Well I guess you don't need it.

1221
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
You probably want it.

1222
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
They sell them in like two packs though.

1223
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I think you can probably buy them at GameStop and stuff.

1224
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
In fact I was just checking right now to see how much they have like the PlayStation VR listed here.

1225
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
If they got the standalone stuff or not.

1226
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I'm tempted. We'll see. We'll see.

1227
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
But I might be buying some computer parts.

1228
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Like you know I've been looking at the show computer.

1229
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
It's not so much because I've actually been talking to somebody about some upgrades for this.

1230
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
But I'm looking at a complete sound overhaul.

1231
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Standalone suggests the headset itself $199.

1232
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Oh, that's tempting.

1233
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And then if you want like.

1234
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I think that might be.

1235
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Is that like. I can't.

1236
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Is that new.

1237
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
That is new.

1238
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Yeah. Brand new. So $199.

1239
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
OK.

1240
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Then you probably pick up a move for like $50.

1241
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
And then the move. I think the move controllers.

1242
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I think they're like $50 or $60 bucks for two of them.

1243
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
It's really inexpensive.

1244
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
OK. Here we go.

1245
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Just sorry I'm bringing something.

1246
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,000
While I'm doing that while that page is loading though I did want to say also PlayStation Plus.

1247
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
They've announced what the games are going to be for April.

1248
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And it looks pretty awesome.

1249
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
So the one big game that they got Mad Max is going to be free.

1250
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
OK. Which is a pretty awesome game.

1251
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Also Trackmania Turbo if you don't have that yet which unfortunately I do.

1252
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:06,000
And then also looks like I think this is one of the last months that we're going to get PlayStation 3 and Vita games.

1253
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
But in Space we brawl for PS3 Toy Home on PS3.

1254
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Ninety nine VITAs.

1255
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I think it's VITAs.

1256
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
On the Vita.

1257
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And Qbert reloaded on the Vita.

1258
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
It's also it's also cross by with PlayStation.

1259
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
That game is fucking terrible.

1260
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Just so you know.

1261
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
But it's free.

1262
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
It isn't even worth free.

1263
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Mad Max is worth free.

1264
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
So definitely check out Mad Max if you guys get chance.

1265
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
And then let's see.

1266
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
So did this page load.

1267
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
No it didn't.

1268
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Because GameStop's page fucking sucks.

1269
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Whatever.

1270
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
All right. It's fine. It's not a big deal.

1271
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
All right.

1272
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Any more stories.

1273
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Yeah.

1274
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I've got like tons of shit pulled up.

1275
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
So let's.

1276
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
This is something they'll be interested in.

1277
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Luminous Remastered.

1278
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
For Switch.

1279
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Oh yes. Yes I did.

1280
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Thank you for bringing this up.

1281
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I did hear about this because it was part of the Nindies thing that they did.

1282
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Yeah.

1283
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
While we were gone.

1284
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
That was two weeks ago I think.

1285
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
But it's fine.

1286
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Whatever.

1287
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
But we should talk about it.

1288
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Yes.

1289
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
So Luminous Remastered.

1290
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I'm so about.

1291
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Well it's not just on Switch.

1292
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I mean I'll probably get it there.

1293
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Yeah.

1294
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
It's Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

1295
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Yeah.

1296
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
But how would I not get it on Switch.

1297
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Exactly.

1298
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
With the ability to do portable just like the old school one and you know dock it as

1299
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
well.

1300
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Like it's.

1301
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It's.

1302
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
It's hard now.

1303
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
The Switch makes a really compelling argument when it's like the same price.

1304
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And it's portable on that system.

1305
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
You know versus PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1306
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
As much as I love some of my games on those systems.

1307
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
So.

1308
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Yeah.

1309
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
And here's some of the things that they have in there.

1310
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
So they've got you know new skins.

1311
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
They had two new levels.

1312
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
40 skins as well.

1313
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Different modes.

1314
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
HD rumble effects.

1315
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
So you can you know feel different stuff like that.

1316
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And of course trans vibration.

1317
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Yay.

1318
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And you could do it with like up to like 10 Switch controllers or something crazy like

1319
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
that.

1320
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I didn't.

1321
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Yeah.

1322
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I don't see how many.

1323
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
But yeah it's.

1324
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Yeah.

1325
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Like multiple Switch.

1326
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
You could.

1327
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And I was like where would you put all those controllers.

1328
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Don't answer that.

1329
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
What are you talking about.

1330
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Remember dark soccer.

1331
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Ain't as thing as possible.

1332
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I can't even.

1333
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
How old are we.

1334
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
12.

1335
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
All right.

1336
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Almost 16.

1337
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Speaking of games coming to different systems.

1338
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
The game that I don't know if anybody is really asking for this to come to the system but

1339
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
it is anyways.

1340
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
No Man's Sky coming the Xbox One.

1341
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
At least you get it when it's better than it was when it launched.

1342
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
You know.

1343
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I.

1344
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
You know they.

1345
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Bless their hearts for still working on that game.

1346
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And they've still working on the game.

1347
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
This is going to have you know all the features and all the release you know updates that

1348
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
they've done so far.

1349
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:56,000
And they're working on something called next No Man's Sky next which is their next step

1350
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
and they're teasing it hard and they're not really seeing what it is teasing would be

1351
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
excited.

1352
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Yes.

1353
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
They're teasing it.

1354
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
They're going to claim the moon you know but I don't know.

1355
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
It's all right.

1356
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
It's not it's not a terrible game to pick up but at least it's better than what I would

1357
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,000
only buy it on Xbox One depending on the price and depending on I mean if you already have

1358
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,000
it on PC or PlayStation 4 I don't understand why you would want to get it on Xbox One.

1359
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
But I know some people out there are you know exclusively Microsoft in their house you know

1360
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and that's that's fine.

1361
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
So this is a chance for them to get on board.

1362
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,000
But you know again if the game's like twenty nine ninety nine you know like they've done a

1363
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
lot of updates to it.

1364
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
It's not the same game that people wrote off when it first came out.

1365
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
So it's worth a look I think.

1366
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah I mean I don't know what you're into if you're into the Minecraft.

1367
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I think it's that game is more like Minecraft than anything else.

1368
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I mean you don't build so much with the exploration and a lot of that same sensation.

1369
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I don't know at least that's what I get out of it.

1370
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
But you know what if you want something like Minecraft you could play Minecraft.

1371
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
You could.

1372
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I don't know I I think people are really harsh on no man's sky and I understand why but I

1373
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
think a lot's changed in the past couple of years.

1374
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,000
And if you haven't checked it out in a while it's worth looking at again.

1375
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And then to go along with that you know VR discount they just did the VR update for wipeout.

1376
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
That's pretty close.

1377
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Oh yeah it's pretty close.

1378
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
You know if zero that's the closest thing I'll get to have zero.

1379
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
That seems like who that seems like that would almost be like like headache inducing that moving

1380
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
that fast.

1381
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
It would definitely be something.

1382
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Yeah I want to check that out kinda.

1383
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
You're making a case I almost like God.

1384
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I just I need more shit in my living room.

1385
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
It's fun for a while.

1386
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I know I know I know.

1387
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Wipeout is only best with an edgy con.

1388
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Well you can't get that on the PlayStation 4 I'm sorry to say.

1389
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Yeah so the PlayStation 4 is highly inferior.

1390
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:03,000
And then I guess I guess I can talk about one more thing and that's Duke Nukem the movie happening.

1391
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
John Cena is Duke Nukem.

1392
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
OK I would watch it.

1393
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
To see John Cena is Duke Nukem.

1394
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Whatever.

1395
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Whatever.

1396
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
It's my bar for Duke Nukem the movie.

1397
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
So low.

1398
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I mean it just can't get any lower after you know Duke Nukem forever.

1399
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
So there is no way I can be disappointed by John Cena in a Duke Nukem movie.

1400
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
It's impossible.

1401
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I mean who else would you cast right.

1402
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I guess it makes sense.

1403
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
He does look the part.

1404
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
He does have the square head.

1405
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And he has to do the hand in his face so that we know it's John Cena.

1406
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
He's doing that whole pro wrestling to acting thing just like The Rock did.

1407
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
It's hilarious.

1408
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
He's like he's in the woods.

1409
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
It's like there's like OK.

1410
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
He's in that new movie The Cockblockers.

1411
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Yeah exactly.

1412
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
He's so charismatic.

1413
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
That movie Blockers or whatever which is probably a garbage movie.

1414
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I saw John Cena and I'm like I probably would watch that.

1415
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
You know it's like he has got the charisma.

1416
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
It's like what.

1417
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
What are you going to do.

1418
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I mean it's probably an absolute shit movie.

1419
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
But does he have the uniqueness nerve and talent.

1420
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I don't know.

1421
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I think that one sailed.

1422
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I try I try Jamie I tried.

1423
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
All right.

1424
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,000
So is that it for news for tonight.

1425
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Yeah sure why not.

1426
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
All right.

1427
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Well it is a shorter news.

1428
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Oh you got one more.

1429
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
No I've just been reading.

1430
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I finished a World of Warcraft novel.

1431
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Oh one of the Christie Golden books.

1432
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Yeah because I really love her writing.

1433
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:32,000
And I was really pissed because I actually want more newer stuff and there aren't any newer books.

1434
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Which which book.

1435
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I finished war crimes.

1436
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
OK.

1437
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:42,000
And it was honestly because you keep in mind I didn't finish the pandaria stuff.

1438
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
So it was actually kind of cool and I thought it was a really well-written book.

1439
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I really enjoy reading what she writes.

1440
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
So and I want more and I'm kind of pissed off that there wasn't more because I wasn't interested in anything else.

1441
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Because the only book that came out after that was the Illidan novel and it was more of a backtracking.

1442
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
It was a good book.

1443
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Right.

1444
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
But I want more like current stuff.

1445
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
OK. So one quick thing I was going to mention.

1446
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
So they did.

1447
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
There's some news regarding blood stain.

1448
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
So they are talking about that they're never going to be announcing a release window pretty soon.

1449
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
But they did announce their US or the English voice cast for it.

1450
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,000
So let's see they've got Erica Lindbeck for the character Miriam.

1466
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Also we've got Ann Arena Strober who's in Persona and Fire Emblem.

1467
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Who else Christopher Swindle.

1468
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I'm trying to see if there's any other recognizable names I see.

1469
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:56,000
There's only two more here Robbie Belgrade who's in Castlevania Symphony at night as Alucard.

1470
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And he's also the announcer for Tekken so I mean that's kind of cool.

1471
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Oh wow I didn't know that.

1472
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And then finally we've got let's see Jamie Mortell.

1473
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I'm going to butcher his last name.

1474
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Mortellero and he's the director for the voice acting.

1475
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
He did Silent Hill Shattered Memories Halo 4 and EverQuest 2.

1476
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Well I'm excited I'll finally get my Kickstarter pledge to get that free copy of Bloodstained.

1477
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Yeah they said there's going to be a beta backer demo that's going to be available June 2018 and announcing the release of the game.

1478
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
So finally this year it sounds like.

1479
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Maybe.

1480
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Exciting.

1481
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Exciting times.

1482
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Alright well that is about going to do it for another episode of Orange Daunt Radio.

1483
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I know it was short this week but that's because we're a little unplugged a little off the record this week.

1484
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
But we wanted to give you something to hold you over while we're on a little bit of a live break.

1485
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:59,000
But we will be back live April the 8th with the next episode of our show and a full length show with your calls with your emails and with you in our chat at live.vog.net.com.

1486
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,000
But as I do say at the end of every episode if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Daunt Radio please help us spread the word.

1487
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice but only if the voices are here to participate.

1488
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,000
So a nice five star review on iTunes goes a long way or Google Play or wherever it is you found this show.

1489
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And then of course tell a friend or two that all helps that word of mouth is so so important.

1490
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And I think on that note it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1491
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Dark Sakura enjoy the movie tonight.

1492
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
What's your final thought.

1493
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Yeah we're going to go see Pacific Rim 2 just because giant robots and kaiju.

1494
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And John Boyega is in it right.

1495
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Yeah the only thing that makes me a little bit iffy about it is because it's not done by Del Toro.

1496
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
The last movie was so good.

1497
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I really think they should have been the Mako Mori movie but you know whatever.

1498
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,000
I hear it's stupid but I also hear it's really action packed and awesome.

1499
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
It's fun.

1500
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I mean but that was the first one too.

1501
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Get some popcorn.

1502
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
The first one had Ron Perlman in it and I love anything.

1503
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I haven't actually seen the Hellboy movies which I want to.

1504
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
But I love Ron Perlman.

1505
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I want to see the new one with the guy from Stranger Things.

1506
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
He's like eh different guy than Ron Perlman I'm not sure if I can get on board with that.

1507
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And I was like OK I can get on board with that.

1508
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I didn't even know there was a new one but.

1509
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Yeah they're rebooting it.

1510
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Of course they're rebooting every fucking thing.

1511
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Of course.

1512
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Today was the 30th anniversary of Beetlejuice and they're talking about Beetlejuice 2 and.

1513
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
No.

1514
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
No.

1515
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
No.

1516
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
No they are talking about it I'm just saying no.

1517
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
No.

1518
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
But then they also.

1519
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
The only one I'm interested in is Sheetaljuice.

1520
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Because that was Bianca Del Rio.

1521
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Right.

1522
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
All right.

1523
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Let's see my final thought tonight.

1524
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I'm going to do a cheap plug for my other show Shaking and Crying.

Check it out.

1526
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Did you actually do your final thought or were you talking about mine.

1527
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
We haven't got to Loki I was going to do him last.

1528
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
So yeah.

1529

Internally.

1535
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Just thinking about it.

1536
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Internally.

1537
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Loki.

1538
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Last but not least.

1539
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Go see Ready Player One.

1540
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000

1541
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
And hopefully Rob will go see it with me again tomorrow.

1542
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
