This week Microsoft's continued expansion of their avatar system was inadvertently leaked revealing changes allowing a more detailed embodiment of yourself or a person of your own design. That's just one story to come. Join us for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:56.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio prepped for takeoff tonight on episode 727 of our show. For tonight, April the 22nd of 2018, my name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio every week, every single stinking week except the week she doesn't say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Hi, how are you?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I'm alive.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
Good. I'm glad to hear that. You were telling me a little bit about you had a spa day yesterday with one of our lady friends from the DDR days.

01:05.000 --> 01:27.000
Yes. People from those days may know her as DNL Dreams. It was Renee. I met up at her house and we went into San Francisco and went to the Pearl Spa in Japantown. It's a Korean run business and I don't know too much about bathroom rituals for Korea so I don't know if it's the same thing.

01:27.000 --> 01:42.000
But it felt very like a Japanese bath to me where you go and you sit and you clean first and then you can have a hot tub or a cold tub. And so it was really nice. Lots of good soaking. They had a sauna, which I'm not too fond of saunas, and a steam room that was out of order.

01:42.000 --> 01:56.000
But then upstairs they had two other sauna rooms that had like a clay bed that you lay in, like clay balls, red clay balls, and a Himalayan salt room. And they did sheet masks. And I was like, oh, sheet masks. And they gave me two, which I brought for your significant other.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh, there you go.

01:57.000 --> 02:12.000
And because I have a bunch. And then I had like a full body exfoliating scrub. I got over any body shyness I had really quick because you do go in there naked. It's very like that.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Okay. But like women go to the bathroom together, so whatever.

02:15.000 --> 02:29.000
It was scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, all the scrubbing, hot water. And the hot water felt great, but it was surprisingly hot just to have it splashed on me. And like just tons of skin came off. And now I've got baby skin. I keep petting my arm because I don't know who this is anymore.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
And like almost all my calluses are gone. It's amazing.

02:34.000 --> 02:47.000
That actually sounds fun. I would do something like that. Now, not to like give away my home address on air, but a somewhat reasonable distance here from OLR headquarters. There used to be a men's only Korean spa, like not that far from here.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
This was women's only.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
Right. So but this men's only one. I have I am aware that some CD. It is not just.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
It's that kind of bathhouse.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, it's like the one in Berkeley.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
It's not just like massage.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I've learned a lot about bathhouses lately.

03:02.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah. Yeah. So and no, I don't know this firsthand. You pervs. I just I've heard things. There was a bathroom stalls.

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
There was supposed to be a cento like a Japanese style full bath, you know, split men and women's just outside of Sacramento.

03:17.000 --> 03:27.000
And I think it closed down because it was when I was looking for places because it's like, where am I going to find outside of San Francisco or that infamous male bathhouse in Berkeley?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
What's basically hookup bathhouse?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I didn't even tell you the punchline of this whole thing.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
No, it's fine. The the the thing closed. It's gone.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
And in its place is the same name, Burger and Shake.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
So it's like the family must have decided, maybe this business.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
So but now it's going to be Burger and Shake.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
So I can just see one of these days, Loki's going to bring a bill bag, a burger and shakes in this place.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
And maybe like, do you know what used to happen there?

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Oh, it still happens there, too.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
So you get your burger and your shake on.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
Burger and shake wink.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
How are you doing, Techmaster Loki?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
I'm doing fine.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Good, good. Full of breadsticks, I see.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Full of breadsticks.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Good. A very breakfast of champions and dinner, too.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Yep. All three meals, pretty much.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah. How's how's your week been?

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
I saw I saw some pictures on the old book of faces over at Old Town.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
So you must have taken the fam out for a play day.

04:25.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah. The kids wanted to go on the light rail to Old Sacramento, to the railroad museum.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Sadly, we got to light rail station right as the light rail came and we missed it.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
So we just drove down there anyways, which is probably better anyways.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Who wants to sell light rail train for 30 minutes?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Especially with the kids.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
They wanted to because they thought it'd be exciting.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
But we instead we went on like the steam train that they have there.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Oh, that's cool.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
Had dinner and I played lots of Pokemon Go and even on the steam train, which is great because it doesn't go very fast.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I hit all the focus apps along the way.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Brilliant. Brilliant.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
Did you did you see that shop that has the classic arcade games in the back?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
No.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Oh, it's not far from where those trains are.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
There's a little there's a shop and it's like a it's like a kitsch, knickknack type of shop.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
But in the back, they have a bunch of like 80s arcade games.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
They want like 50 cents a play, though, to play shit like Defender and Joust.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
And they have them. There's like the second candy.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
So there's like the candy heaven, which is like there's like four candy barrel stores and there's like two sock stores.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
Like who who gets them? Like who shops for socks?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Alan. Alan loves fun socks. Yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Jamie, I thought this was the thing you'd like to.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I really like socks, but they have to be well-made socks.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
So I won't buy funny socks if they're not well-made.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
I do. I do like I like cute socks and I don't care how they're made.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
J.D., who comes on the show once in a while, he's in our chat now and he'll be here next week.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
He got me this really cute pair of Jigglypuff socks.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
So, you know, for when I play Pokemon Go.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
And when I was at the mall not that long ago, I got Bob Ross socks.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
They're super cute. So, OK, well, apparently everybody's more in the socks than I was aware.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
But anyways, so they used to have like I remember that because we were walking by some of the stores and like,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
oh, yeah, that's where the Nickel Arcade used to be.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
But like I remember that second candy store and I know there's probably dozens of other ones,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
but the second one that's kind of in the corner there,

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
they had like classic arcade games in the back too at the time.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Oh, that's random.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
But they don't anymore and no one's in there because, you know, everyone's at the other candy store, which is way better.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Oh, poor guys. All right.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
I do want to say hello to our chat room where we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network,

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
vog network dot com at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
But a programming note, Bobby, he was here tonight.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
He's going to be gone for the next couple of weeks, but we will still be here.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
We don't have any shows off till the end of June.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
So we'll be here for the next few weeks, again, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
And if you are listening live, you can join us in our chat room at live dot vog network dot com.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
All those chat issues from last week, they were resolved in the middle of the week.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
Essentially, it was explained to me the same way it was explained that the Oculus Rift,

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
remember when their website just kind of stopped because the security certificate was bad?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
That's kind of what happened to our chat last week.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
So there was nothing we could do about it during the show.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
But the issue magically fixed itself in the middle of the week.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
Bobby as a fail safe also put some other like alternative links there if that happens again.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
So sorry about last week, guys, but shit happens.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
So well, but we made it through a show last week.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
It was a fun show last week.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
And it'll be a fun show tonight, too, with more folks in our chat over at live dot vog network dot com.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
And Bobby Black Wolf actually starts us off.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
He sends a link.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
But he said, did somebody say gaming socks and pointed out these are the socks I wore at my wedding?

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
And they're actually Katamari Damacy socks, which to go with the cake that Bobby had at his wedding.

07:50.000 --> 07:57.000
See, see now, Loki, can you see why we like socks when it's things like this, like the king of all cosmos?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I do, though.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
I tell you, I find cute socks at Daiso sometimes and I will buy them because they're pile socks,

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
not just a tweet, you know, to give Daiso some business because Daiso is big and all over the world.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
But their socks are really well made and I ruin socks.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
These I've had for a year and they're still not ruined.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
My stripey socks from Daiso.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Bobby wants to clarify in chat.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
He didn't know about the cake and the socks were a gift from the best man.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So the best man was in on this thing.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Maybe. Or it's all just a wonderful coincidence.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
So it works. It works.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
Sia Tabiri in our chat also points out that socks was the number one Clinton kitty.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
Well, yeah, but socks ended up being given away when they got a dog.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Oh, I forgot about that.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah. And the ladies had socks until until socks died.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
But we need another president with a cat instead of, you know, this anti-Semitic tweeting shithole that we have.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
I should be president if for no other reason than Mr. Smoosh could be first cat.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
I mean, well, I should be president.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Well, you well, I should be president.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Well, I'm actually of legal age to be president.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
So am I. So, yeah, you did.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Yes. Yes. Look, Jamie lies to people.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Why would you vote for her?

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
We should co-preside. We'll just take turns.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
You can be. Well, you're more qualified than the current secretary of education.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
So why don't you try to roll through?

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I actually went to public school.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
All right. Anyway, it's not a politics show. It's a gaming show.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Let's get into some gaming news. Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Oh, boy. Get your tea, because this is going to be a rough patch.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Hey, let's talk about Mass Effect Andromeda, dark soccer.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Why don't we talk a little bit about that and drama.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah. And with it, shall I begin my my bitter tears?

09:46.000 --> 09:56.000
Hold hold them for a minute, because just in case some folks weren't aware, there was a blog that was posted this week by the general manager of Bioware, Casey Hudson, who is the what?

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
He's the on again off again employee over Bioware. He's on right now.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
And he mentioned in this blog post Mass Effect Andromeda wasn't going to be getting DLC.

10:05.000 --> 10:18.000
We already knew that. But he talked about kind of like what went on behind the scenes, that it was kind of like shocking to them, I guess, because they mentioned, you know, we all know the Korean arc was the thing that was going to happen supposedly at one point in the story.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
They're satisfying this through a book or something now, a comic book. I don't know.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I stopped caring because I'm so mad about it.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
But anyway, Casey Hudson in the blog post called this a defining moment for Bioware.

10:28.000 --> 10:37.000
So the moment they found out they weren't going to do DLC that EA, I guess, had pretty much pulled the plug on Mass Effect Andromeda, which was their own fucking fault to begin with.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
But anyway, they decided that they weren't going to do the DLC and Bioware called this a defining moment.

10:44.000 --> 10:53.000
So we need to delight players with new experiences and innovations, says Hudson, but we must stay focused on the importance of our world, character and storytelling elements that players expect from our games.

10:53.000 --> 11:03.000
And our games must be designed to continue delivering new stories and experiences in an ongoing relationship with players within the worlds we're evolving together.

11:03.000 --> 11:11.000
So he mentioned about Anthem, the world, story and character will be available to experience in co-op in an ongoing series of adventures.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
Anthem will be unlike anything you've played, but if we do it right, it will be very distinctively Bioware.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
And I'm at the point where this game can go fuck itself.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
And I hate to say that because I know there are lots of people that are working very hard on this game.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
And this is not about any of those programmers or any of those people that are just trying to make a living and do a job.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
And I feel very, very bad that I'm having to talk so negatively about Anthem.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
The fault is not with you guys. It is very clear it is at the executive level. It always has been.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
And it's at a level where it's EA's fucking fault.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
And I don't care about Anthem.

11:47.000 --> 11:55.000
Bioware, I'm not sure Bioware realizes how badly they've alienated people with this whole debacle.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
And the people that they want to be supporting Anthem, a lot of the people that have supported Dragon Age and Mass Effect.

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
And to be all like, well, since the DLC model or whatever didn't work, we're going to have to go to co-op, co-op, co-op.

12:08.000 --> 12:38.000
Games as a service, herpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderp

13:08.000 --> 13:11.600
violence that's happened in some of the previous series and kind of like some of

13:11.600 --> 13:14.880
the ethical questions about that stuff apparently God of War is kind of this new

13:14.880 --> 13:19.040
ones chewing on it kind of makes me go shit I think I might I think I might pick

13:19.040 --> 13:22.120
this up like I kind of want to play this new God of War game the more and more I

13:22.120 --> 13:26.920
hear about it the more I see about it so don't fucking sit there and tell me EA

13:26.920 --> 13:32.160
Bioware that there's no room for single-player experiences like like

13:32.160 --> 13:36.120
continue to show me that you're continuing to make bad decisions Bioware

13:36.120 --> 13:39.200
Bioware is gonna be gone in the next couple years you're not gonna get a new

13:39.200 --> 13:42.840
dragon yeah they're they're the next company on the chopping block that EA is

13:42.840 --> 13:47.960
gonna absorb in and just destroy I hate I hate saying this I hate being negative

13:47.960 --> 13:51.800
you know I am NOT negative when it comes to games but it's these fucking

13:51.800 --> 13:56.020
decisions that happen at such a high level that made me so angry and I would

13:56.020 --> 13:59.760
guess a lot of the things that make us you know angry gamers and stuff is

13:59.760 --> 14:03.540
usually the fault of some type of executive decision hell a lot of the

14:03.540 --> 14:07.540
stuff that usually even Loki gets on his horse with Nintendo about it's

14:07.540 --> 14:10.140
usually some type of decision at the very very top gotta keep those

14:10.140 --> 14:13.860
shareholders happy we're angry when we love it Jamie I know you want to spill

14:13.860 --> 14:18.020
some tea what was what was your reaction to hearing all this fuck them I've been

14:18.020 --> 14:22.380
fuck them since anthem was announced but why I mean like because remember there's

14:22.380 --> 14:26.540
gonna be people listening to this that are like olr they're just more angry

14:26.540 --> 14:30.460
jaded angry I thought it looked cool I thought anthem look cool but then again

14:30.700 --> 14:37.100
I know it looks cool it's all the bullshit that's in the back end that is

14:37.100 --> 14:41.940
gonna drive me away from it right it's just that I really was into Mass Effect

14:41.940 --> 14:45.780
Andromeda story I really enjoyed it I want to find out what happened to the

14:45.780 --> 14:49.580
quarry ins I want it in without reading a book about I love books mind you and

14:49.580 --> 14:55.200
I'll probably read the book but I wanted more and there was an even now knowing

14:55.200 --> 15:00.420
there was more and they're not giving it to us fuck them all over this fucking

15:00.420 --> 15:05.340
stupid piece of shit game that they don't think they think they know what we

15:05.340 --> 15:09.620
want without fucking asking us what the fuck we want that's bingo that that's it

15:09.620 --> 15:13.700
there's the tea right there they think they know what we want without asking us

15:13.700 --> 15:18.340
what we want so fuck them that's and that's what I fucking need EA to do here

15:18.340 --> 15:24.580
I need EA to come out and take some fucking accountability EA not Bioware

15:24.580 --> 15:29.220
don't fucking send Casey Hudson to do it EA you come out and take some

15:29.220 --> 15:33.460
accountability for why Mass Effect Andromeda flocked it in flock because of

15:33.460 --> 15:37.660
the flop because the fans it flop because of you they never will look at

15:37.660 --> 15:41.780
Star Wars they're never gonna do that it's never ever gonna happen so that's

15:41.780 --> 15:46.560
why anthem can go fuck itself I already why I'm angry I'm ready to start like a

15:46.560 --> 15:52.180
boycott EA hashtag well I mean I'm ready to have been there yeah no offense but

15:52.180 --> 15:55.740
been there done that but it does bring attention to it and if people put in

15:55.740 --> 16:01.580
there why you know or boycott anthem may you maybe instead of using the word

16:01.580 --> 16:06.020
boycott because I don't think that's what this is I'm not boycotting anthem

16:06.020 --> 16:14.100
I'm I don't not buying it I don't pre-order this I I'm trying to think of

16:14.100 --> 16:17.540
something but it's something like I no longer hmm I'm trying to think of

16:17.540 --> 16:22.140
something that's not so like that's more real like we use no it's not even it's

16:22.140 --> 16:27.660
like I I'm done with Bioware because or I or no it's more EA it's not even

16:27.660 --> 16:32.660
about done with EA done with EA yeah that's it I'm starting I did I thought

16:32.660 --> 16:37.500
somebody said in chat yeah done with EA because you know and what this is it's

16:37.500 --> 16:42.700
not a boycott it's just like I'm I'm done I'm done well and I'll be honest I

16:42.700 --> 16:51.540
don't think I've played an EA game in how long a while what was like my first

16:51.580 --> 16:58.740
act as president will be well be here's I mean I don't know anyway going to chat

16:58.740 --> 17:03.860
at live dot vog network comm looking at some of the comments there act Efton

17:03.860 --> 17:08.380
chat says we as a consumer we also don't know what we want I'd be very curious Oh

17:08.380 --> 17:12.260
active says companies think people want battle royale games so we'll be getting

17:12.260 --> 17:16.100
into that later come on no Gus and chat says Rob Roberts has been wanting to

17:16.100 --> 17:20.220
drag them a little bit I didn't really want to discuss this topic but it did

17:20.220 --> 17:23.900
become you know news this week when you know Casey Hudson and Bioware put out

17:23.900 --> 17:29.980
that statement let's see phantasm chat says I'll boycott EA by not going to

17:29.980 --> 17:35.100
their press or at e3 I'm working that day dungeon buster and chat says Sim

17:35.100 --> 17:38.940
City can never be played offline a few months later an offline patch is

17:38.940 --> 17:43.980
introduced Bobby Blackwell says we say we want single-player but our actions

17:43.980 --> 17:48.220
show all multiplayer and battle royale you don't see God of War being the top

17:48.220 --> 17:52.780
game on twitch but as the top game I mean maybe part of the reason people

17:52.780 --> 17:55.500
don't want to watch single-player stuff on twitch all the time is because they

17:55.500 --> 18:00.700
don't want the story spoiled so is twitch rankings really the best way to

18:00.700 --> 18:05.380
evaluate that I mean it should be just sales if this God of War game if

18:05.380 --> 18:09.460
horizon's yield zero dawn are selling millions and millions of copies which I

18:09.460 --> 18:14.740
don't see how I'm sure horizon zero dawn did very well yeah because Sony doesn't

18:14.740 --> 18:18.820
stop talking about it they did the expansion for it good for them but also

18:18.820 --> 18:22.460
we got God of War I'm sure of course this game is gonna do well how does God

18:22.460 --> 18:25.100
of War not end up selling like all the other games that they've been I mean

18:25.100 --> 18:32.420
they had until dawn they had and I know there's more in it got Detroit coming up

18:32.420 --> 18:36.740
Detroit yes which is that's not a Sony it's a Sony exclusive but it's the last

18:36.740 --> 18:42.780
of us okay there you go last of us yeah uncharted I mean they kind of rock the

18:42.780 --> 18:46.580
single-player yeah sure they put some multiplayer in there and then I have no

18:46.580 --> 18:50.780
problem with them putting multiplayer stuff in there in as well Mass Effect

18:50.780 --> 18:55.540
3 was rad which is why and we're gonna get into a layer which is why when I

18:55.540 --> 18:59.420
hear this oh well we're not including a certain portion of the game that makes

18:59.420 --> 19:03.460
me think yeah but you're still asking me to pay $60 for your game so you're

19:03.460 --> 19:07.740
telling me oh we're giving you half a game but pay us the full full money and

19:07.740 --> 19:14.380
then some in a season pass let's see Dungeon Buster and chat kind of following

19:14.380 --> 19:18.260
up on that to be fair some games are great to watch on Twitch others are just

19:18.260 --> 19:21.900
damn boring unless the broadcaster is really entertaining which really isn't a

19:21.900 --> 19:26.820
good judge of what people are playing though really mm-hmm you know cuz it's

19:26.820 --> 19:30.300
just like you said people don't always want to see stories spoiled right you

19:30.300 --> 19:35.420
know and sometimes you know you're in a single-player game and like I'll do

19:35.420 --> 19:39.100
Dragon Age from time to time but I'll stop because I'm into the game you know

19:39.100 --> 19:45.540
right it's just not it's really not a good gauge Bobby Blackwolf and chat says

19:45.540 --> 19:49.140
but you watch my Sierra games and a follow-up to that yeah but I and I know

19:49.140 --> 19:51.900
you're saying that a little tongue-in-cheek but you know for one the

19:51.900 --> 19:55.700
Sierra games are very very very old it's like one of those things where it's like

19:55.700 --> 20:01.020
spoiler alert I'm going to spoil the Star Wars series okay Darth Vader's

20:01.020 --> 20:05.180
Luke's father what like you can't really spoil something that's been out for like

20:05.180 --> 20:12.420
30 years right so the boat sinks at the end of Titanic oh my god you know so

20:12.420 --> 20:18.740
anyway with that whole thing people watch Bobby stream because it's Bobby

20:18.740 --> 20:22.860
it's like it's kind of like you said you only watch me play Ni No Kuni 2 because

20:22.860 --> 20:27.820
it's me I don't think you are as into Ni No Kuni 2 sometimes the personality

20:27.820 --> 20:32.780
carries it a lot further there you go and phantasm chat straight up says I

20:32.780 --> 20:38.100
like to play not watch phantasm out of curiosity if you play through a

20:38.100 --> 20:41.820
single-player game or any game will you maybe watch somebody play it after the

20:41.820 --> 20:45.300
fact because I've done that before like I've played through a single-player game

20:45.300 --> 20:48.280
like let's say Final Fantasy 15 or something and then I've gone back and

20:48.280 --> 20:51.220
watched other people play it just to kind of see like how they're gonna react

20:51.220 --> 20:55.820
to the story I know that was a big thing with Until Dawn I know Shane and I had a

20:55.820 --> 20:59.460
conversation about this once because he was super into that game and he loved to

20:59.460 --> 21:03.540
watch twitch streamers play Until Dawn because he wanted to see how they would

21:03.540 --> 21:08.220
react to all the scares and all the you know multiple branching paths to yeah

21:08.220 --> 21:13.340
that's true too for sure and dungeon buster kind of follows up on that too

21:13.340 --> 21:17.500
says actually I'll admit I do like watching some RPGs that I've played

21:17.500 --> 21:21.820
already just to see the reactions to certain scenes for sure and even

21:21.820 --> 21:26.180
something ironically like Mass Effect sometimes they're gonna make story

21:26.180 --> 21:29.420
choices that were different than what you did and so it's kind of like you get

21:29.420 --> 21:32.060
to see a different side of the game like oh that's what happens if you pick

21:32.060 --> 21:35.820
that option I didn't know because when I played through it it was this option you

21:35.820 --> 21:39.940
know so I don't know there's there's some reasons I like to watch that stuff

21:39.940 --> 21:47.020
but anyway I don't know at this point if EA isn't gonna put out any type of

21:47.020 --> 21:51.500
apology for you know basically or accountability for what they did a Mass

21:51.500 --> 21:57.780
Effect Andromeda which I don't expect them to do I hard pass on anthem or

21:57.780 --> 22:02.980
really any big-budget EA title I'm not really ready to completely maybe write

22:02.980 --> 22:06.020
off everything because I also know there's some indie things that the only

22:06.020 --> 22:09.900
way they kind of get out is through the EA support like what was the unravel

22:09.900 --> 22:15.100
that wasn't was that Ubisoft or was that EA oh yeah so I don't know I don't know

22:15.100 --> 22:20.820
well they also just have that was escape plan I think it was called hmm that was

22:20.820 --> 22:27.340
pretty good but at least as far as anthem specifically pass I'm I'm not

22:27.380 --> 22:31.540
seeing past yet until I see what the game is but I have a feeling it's gonna

22:31.540 --> 22:36.820
be like destiny and I will judge honestly I'm not into the whole concept

22:36.820 --> 22:42.740
of destiny really I've been burned by destiny twice now so yeah I still never

22:42.740 --> 22:51.300
it's pretty I'll give it that yeah destiny 2 is pretty anyway let's move on

22:51.300 --> 22:55.340
well I swear we are positive and stuff here on a well r2 it's just that was

22:55.340 --> 22:58.020
something you get y'all know when a Bioware thing came up you had to you had

22:58.020 --> 23:00.460
to know what Jamie was gonna say about what I was gonna say about it yeah fuck

23:00.460 --> 23:04.220
them all right I'm not going to play anthem I'm not going to look at it I'm

23:04.220 --> 23:08.940
not gonna support anything having to do with anthem I will forget anthem exists

23:08.940 --> 23:14.500
in my internal universe you have had it officially I'm done with EA it's okay

23:14.500 --> 23:17.780
though cuz if you pre-order from GameStop I'm sure you'll get an n7 skin

23:17.780 --> 23:22.340
for your whatever you're calling no that not even that offensive like that's

23:22.340 --> 23:28.500
really offensive it is but you watch they haven't announced anything yet I

23:28.500 --> 23:32.340
know I'm willing to bet that that shit is gonna know thing did lure in the mass

23:32.340 --> 23:38.460
I will say this I did participate in the Bioware clearance sale when since

23:38.460 --> 23:43.220
they're changing their storefronts mm-hmm because I finally replaced like

23:43.220 --> 23:47.660
the shirt that I wore holes in mm-hmm and I did it for five bucks

23:47.660 --> 23:51.700
L more chart in our chat I hope I said that right I think that's a newer name

23:51.700 --> 23:57.020
so hi and welcome it says there are very very few games I'll fork out $60 now

23:57.020 --> 24:01.860
thanks to shenanigans like Andromeda last straw kind of thing oh certainly

24:01.860 --> 24:05.660
when it comes to EA and the $60 price tag you betcha I have reservations about

24:05.660 --> 24:09.860
that but you know other other it other companies it really depends Blizzard

24:09.860 --> 24:13.740
you know if Blizzard were to say we're gonna do an overwatch expansion it's

24:13.740 --> 24:18.700
gonna be you know $49.99 or something I if they go like it's single-player I'll

24:18.700 --> 24:22.460
be like I'm in your PVE or whatever I'll be I'm in you know like certain

24:22.460 --> 24:25.860
companies can kind of get away with it like Blizzard you know I'm willing to

24:25.860 --> 24:29.700
pay a high price tag for their games cuz is there a bad Blizzard game I don't

24:29.700 --> 24:34.420
think there is so there have been some bad expansions there well and there have

24:34.420 --> 24:39.140
been games I don't prefer to other games like Starcraft I don't prefer I'm not a

24:39.140 --> 24:42.820
Starcraft fan and I I want to get my game playing Diablo but I still look at

24:42.820 --> 24:47.180
Starcraft and I go it is a good game it's just not my game yeah it's kind of

24:47.180 --> 24:50.020
like that similar thing I have a God of War and that whole series I never really

24:50.020 --> 24:54.460
got into God of War doesn't mean I don't like it I just you know I am one gamer

24:54.460 --> 24:58.780
with a day job that has nothing to do with OLR you know I can only play

24:58.780 --> 25:01.740
somebody by the time I come home I'll be honest because most of the playing I do

25:01.740 --> 25:06.620
is on my computer mm-hmm I don't want to look at a computer all day for my job

25:06.620 --> 25:12.220
and I don't want to look at another one you know maybe I'll have a stream day

25:12.220 --> 25:16.100
maybe it'll just be me fucking around and Wow I don't know there you go

25:16.100 --> 25:21.620
Mega Man x400 one of my good speaking of streaming one of my streamer pals in

25:21.620 --> 25:25.380
chat says that would be pretty fucking rude if they put an n7 skin and anthem

25:25.380 --> 25:28.700
yes it would I'm glad I'm glad we're not a matter of time and we'll be saying it

25:28.700 --> 25:33.980
told you so but I know I know all right positivity happy experiences good things

25:33.980 --> 25:38.620
games are awesome or we wouldn't do this show it's this is all this other stuff

25:38.620 --> 25:41.900
the video game business is what sucks sometimes but video games themselves

25:41.900 --> 25:45.220
fucking awesome let's talk about some fucking awesome things we played this

25:45.220 --> 25:48.900
week our soccer I'm sorry I was looking my bullet journal that's okay how was

25:48.900 --> 25:53.860
your gaming week oh god I didn't really I guess play a whole lot again it's been

25:53.860 --> 25:57.660
a really crazy week because I'm trying to I've got two weeks now before drag

25:57.660 --> 26:03.180
con and I'm trying to get a lot of my stuff together however I had started

26:03.180 --> 26:07.620
firewatch and finally I just like I'm tired of being at my computer so Dan and

26:07.620 --> 26:10.420
I just watched the rest of the game because honestly it's kind of the same

26:10.420 --> 26:13.700
thing and so I really I really liked firewatch and I'm probably gonna go

26:13.700 --> 26:19.980
finish it maybe I'll stream that other than that it's been Pokemon go it's been

26:19.980 --> 26:27.380
idol pouring it's been actually playing some some puyo puyo because I love my

26:27.380 --> 26:31.500
puyo puyo and I'm kind of in the mood for puyo puyo that is fun to say it's

26:31.500 --> 26:38.300
not puyo it's not a it's not a chicken el puyo loco puyo puyo no it's it's

26:38.300 --> 26:49.780
puyo puyo yes just playing the general stuff like that I've got I've got drag

26:49.780 --> 26:54.620
con to get ready for all right conventions they're hard work yeah well

26:54.620 --> 26:58.740
that and I still haven't decided if I'm doing Shirley Manson styled girl drag

26:58.740 --> 27:02.260
for the 90s huh or if I'm just gonna do sister face the whole time well it

27:02.260 --> 27:05.620
sounds like you've managed to fit in a few games here and there so yeah I mean

27:05.620 --> 27:10.260
I play when I can I'm also finishing up a book okay all right well let's move

27:10.260 --> 27:13.140
over to Loki how was your gaming week how many and play a whole ton of stuff

27:13.140 --> 27:17.860
nothing really on console just because my wife's been watching all of the shows

27:17.860 --> 27:23.260
on TV like literally all of them so I haven't been able to play any consoles

27:23.260 --> 27:27.220
and I've really man when I picked up our cry 5 I really should have gotten it on

27:27.220 --> 27:36.380
PC but I didn't know well whatever um so I played them Pokemon go quite a bit

27:36.380 --> 27:40.020
this weekend just because I was out where there's pokey stops and I was

27:40.020 --> 27:47.700
trying to gear up basically I played a little tiny bit of ingress just in

27:47.700 --> 27:53.260
between waiting for stuff to respond and Pokemon go and a little bit of the

27:53.260 --> 27:57.580
office space game which I don't even know why I still play that fucking thing

27:57.580 --> 28:04.660
I swear to God it's just stupid that's pretty much it sadly um wow I hate to

28:04.660 --> 28:09.500
kind of have a slow gaming week across the board but I didn't play a lot of new

28:09.500 --> 28:14.260
stuff but I still played a lot of the existing stuff still been playing um the

28:14.260 --> 28:21.900
name is gay I can't always say the be mania 2dx but it's not 2dx yes DJ max

28:21.940 --> 28:25.180
respect I've still been playing DJ max respect I'm still trying to clear all

28:25.180 --> 28:28.740
the songs in six button mode so I've been playing that I've been playing a

28:28.740 --> 28:32.460
little bit on Xbox actually because that is now the cons because I moved the

28:32.460 --> 28:36.940
PlayStation 4 to the office so I can do more streaming from it the Xbox one is

28:36.940 --> 28:40.200
now kind of my console that's hooked up to the TV and you know okay I had the

28:40.200 --> 28:44.700
weirdest problem with my Xbox one for the longest time like the fan that it

28:44.700 --> 28:48.420
was hooked up to it would make a lot of noise like it was very like but like

28:48.420 --> 28:54.300
they did some recent update and like that stopped I don't know like can a can

28:54.300 --> 28:58.500
a patch like change the hardware like that like well they could probably maybe

28:58.500 --> 29:02.300
change the firmware kicks on could be a firmware update that's pretty cool that

29:02.300 --> 29:05.820
they finally like change that cuz well my Xbox is quiet and I leave it plugged

29:05.820 --> 29:11.460
in a lot well I mean it actually is your your fans will usually kick on when

29:11.460 --> 29:15.980
you've got you know an excess of heat running on your computer if it changes

29:15.980 --> 29:20.060
the way the heat is detected or the power management system then certainly

29:20.060 --> 29:23.100
the fans wouldn't kick on so much I mean the same thing can happen like I'll use

29:23.100 --> 29:26.620
a Mac for an example you've got your fans running kind of high you can do an

29:26.620 --> 29:30.700
SMC reset and sometimes it will keep the fans from running like they were even

29:30.700 --> 29:33.860
when my Xbox one was powered off you would still hear the power brick going

29:33.860 --> 29:39.580
oh yeah it has to cool down yeah so it was it was so they fixed it somehow so

29:39.580 --> 29:45.300
cool with that but let's see so stuff I've been playing though so I did

29:45.340 --> 29:48.100
actually okay so here's the crazy thing you guys are gonna think this is so

29:48.100 --> 29:53.060
weird I did get super I've probably played like for four hours this week one

29:53.060 --> 29:56.860
game that I haven't played in a long time you ready for this especially you

29:56.860 --> 30:02.300
Loki you ready I played a lot of minecraft this week why did you say

30:02.300 --> 30:06.700
anything I would have totally played with you yeah no and it's not like it's

30:06.700 --> 30:11.580
the windows 10 minecraft yeah I didn't I did not realize they've changed so much

30:11.580 --> 30:18.220
yes so much is changing but doesn't it run so good it runs so good and plus

30:18.220 --> 30:22.900
like when did they make it so that like the PC version doesn't have the manual

30:22.900 --> 30:26.540
crafting anymore you just go into that big recipe book and it's just like

30:26.540 --> 30:29.980
anything you want to make and you can see exactly what you need to make it not

30:29.980 --> 30:35.060
too long ago they still have that what quality of life awesome shit is this so

30:35.060 --> 30:38.140
like it kind of made me excited about minecraft again so I just started

30:38.140 --> 30:43.540
playing now I don't think I have the best world because you know you can put

30:43.540 --> 30:47.020
in a seed and you can get whatever world you want so of course the seed that I

30:47.020 --> 30:52.580
used was Miss Vangie and that's the seed I used to do this world but spoiler

30:52.580 --> 30:56.100
alert Miss Vangie's world kind of starts you in the middle of all these sand

30:56.100 --> 31:00.740
dunes which isn't the most exciting place to start at least if I roll a

31:00.740 --> 31:04.400
world named Miss Vangie and you roll a world name is all the same it's all the

31:04.400 --> 31:08.400
same but you have to do like I did with a capital M capital V right if you did

31:08.400 --> 31:11.060
lowercase and lowercase V to you to completely it would be completely okay

31:11.060 --> 31:14.400
so maybe if you and I decide to play together we'll start on a different

31:14.400 --> 31:18.040
world that's like just just Vangie or something we'll do something like that

31:18.040 --> 31:22.560
yeah all right there you go you could just do Vanessa Vangie Mateo and what

31:22.560 --> 31:27.960
you get or as in our chat suggest JD suggests Miss Vangie with five A's Miss

31:28.600 --> 31:36.640
Vangie exactly okay so anyway um so yeah spoiler alert the Miss Vangie world not

31:36.640 --> 31:40.240
so great so although it does seem like there's a lot of other biomes nearby

31:40.240 --> 31:44.000
we're trying to get that achievement but and lots of there's lots of wildlife in

31:44.000 --> 31:47.600
the starting area like finding the sheep to get the wool that was really easy

31:47.600 --> 31:52.180
because I forgot like man trying to make a bed really sucks and like the thing

31:52.180 --> 31:55.640
that's like the toughest thing about Minecraft I think is like try well

31:55.640 --> 31:59.960
because I play in survival mode I play easy survival yeah because I want there

31:59.960 --> 32:04.760
to be a point and although don't get me wrong like I love the shit I see in

32:04.760 --> 32:08.120
creative mode I love how people basically use minecraft as like virtual

32:08.120 --> 32:14.120
Legos I love that stuff but like that's not for I'm not as artistic so that mode

32:14.120 --> 32:17.600
doesn't speak to me as much as like survival mode where it's like there is a

32:17.600 --> 32:22.080
game the game is to survive and not get killed by creepers and stuff I get more

32:22.080 --> 32:26.560
thrill out of that so but the hardest part is that you have to build a house

32:26.560 --> 32:32.000
in the first like ten minutes because if you don't then when the monsters come

32:32.000 --> 32:35.720
out like they're gonna be skeletons and spiders and creepers and shit that spawn

32:35.720 --> 32:39.880
right by your house but like trying to get a bed for your house that's hard

32:39.880 --> 32:43.180
because you've got to find like what three pieces of wool which means you

32:43.180 --> 32:46.080
have to basically kill sheep because you're not gonna get shears that fast

32:46.080 --> 32:50.080
which when did they put shears in Minecraft that was something I was like

32:50.080 --> 32:55.040
that's been in the since the Xbox 360 really yeah I missed the boat on that

32:55.040 --> 32:58.920
somehow so anyway it's just faster just to kill them so it doesn't matter I

32:58.920 --> 33:03.000
guess I guess so anyway without going on and on about a game that's years and

33:03.000 --> 33:06.280
years old I've been rediscovering minecraft so if you haven't played

33:06.280 --> 33:11.140
minecraft in like two years I would say fire it up and see what's changed cuz

33:11.140 --> 33:14.920
you know it felt like kind of a new game to me in many ways so that was really

33:14.920 --> 33:19.600
cool so anyway so yeah we need to we need to do a multiplayer that would be

33:19.600 --> 33:23.560
really fun cuz I you it's all through the realms thing now right well realms

33:23.560 --> 33:27.400
are like the servers so if you keep a serve you want like a server to keep

33:27.400 --> 33:32.240
going huh you pay for realms and then people can log into that but it's like

33:32.240 --> 33:38.280
very limited the amount of people can connect at a time but you can just do

33:38.280 --> 33:43.960
multiplayer also okay that's cool now with the realms can I play on PC and

33:43.960 --> 33:53.720
somebody on Xbox one can yep thing Oh Xbox one the switch phone VR oh that's

33:53.720 --> 33:57.680
something we didn't have before when we had the vog server before it was all PC

33:57.680 --> 34:02.320
yeah oh you making me think maybe we need to need to check out a realm for 30

34:02.320 --> 34:06.640
days and see what happens okay all right all right I think I think that might be

34:06.640 --> 34:10.800
a thing we do and then we play in the official vog network but I'm still using

34:10.800 --> 34:15.520
Vangie as a seed well realm yeah I mean you could just do it like survival

34:15.520 --> 34:20.600
okay create creative was fun but like I don't know it like it almost it like

34:20.600 --> 34:23.520
defeats the point and it was fun like with mods and stuff on there but you

34:23.520 --> 34:30.200
can't really do that so much anymore you can pay for like they have like skins I

34:30.200 --> 34:33.280
guess you can pay for like they kind of skin up everything and change a little

34:33.280 --> 34:37.640
bit of this stuff but I don't know okay Bobby and chat says wait till I get back

34:37.760 --> 34:41.440
so maybe that's gonna be a thing all right in a couple weeks so all right

34:41.440 --> 34:44.880
sounds good and that that gives our listeners time to prepare themselves and

34:44.880 --> 34:52.000
go rediscover minecraft so we'll be we'll be working on that all right Bobby

34:52.000 --> 34:55.320
Blackwell says I have the Xbox one version which has parity with Windows

34:55.320 --> 34:59.280
10 see I had I I knew that they had like the crossplay but I didn't really I kind

34:59.280 --> 35:02.400
of thought like I wonder if the realms is how they title that together so that

35:02.400 --> 35:07.400
you don't have to yeah real realers anymore realms are just one of that

35:07.800 --> 35:11.360
servers paying for realms basically or that you were paying for servers

35:11.360 --> 35:15.000
Microsoft one of them well it's also to make it easier because you know setting

35:15.000 --> 35:20.320
up a server right server is kind of it can be a little bit of a pain and they

35:20.320 --> 35:24.000
still have like the PC PC version if you want to do that you know the Java

35:24.000 --> 35:28.320
version if you want to still run the servers and everything but they do have

35:28.320 --> 35:31.280
realms now they're a little bit better so the only people excluded are

35:31.280 --> 35:36.720
PlayStation 4 and Vita from that but that's Sony's fault that's not yeah okay

35:37.040 --> 35:41.360
all right well and probably the X you know obviously the older systems ps3 and

35:41.360 --> 35:46.000
360 right because those haven't updated but like switch I think is gonna be

35:46.000 --> 35:50.120
getting it soon I don't have their update yet but then there we talked about

35:50.120 --> 35:53.820
last week the new updates gonna have the Xbox actually last week talking about it

35:53.820 --> 35:57.840
and then seeing it on the Nintendo switch store I almost bought it on the

35:57.840 --> 36:02.320
switch and I was like it's 30 bucks I was like you know I have it on PC hello

36:02.320 --> 36:06.280
let me go let me go revisit it on PC so I did and that's when I started

36:06.280 --> 36:09.520
discovering like when the fuck did they change all this so there's a lot I've

36:09.520 --> 36:13.320
been played in months so it's like every time I go back I'm like what is all this

36:13.320 --> 36:18.960
shit right it's all new anyway so I could dust off mine all right okay I've

36:18.960 --> 36:23.320
also though I actually every so often like if I'm bored at work during my

36:23.320 --> 36:27.160
lunch or something I'll play on my Mac okay I'll never call it out for my

36:27.160 --> 36:31.800
gaming time but okay I play on a Mac all right I don't know if the Mac versions

36:31.800 --> 36:35.760
the same as like the Windows 10 I don't care I just play creative anyway because

36:35.760 --> 36:41.280
I dig holes all right anyway I didn't mean to turn my entire segment into a

36:41.280 --> 36:44.200
Minecraft thing but hey it is it is probably the game I played more than

36:44.200 --> 36:48.200
anything else this week so but I think I think I might start over on a better

36:48.200 --> 36:53.000
seed just because yeah the Miss Vangie didn't work out so well as to see I

36:53.000 --> 36:55.480
don't know if you guys if you guys you know maybe we can make it the Vangie

36:55.480 --> 37:02.240
challenge if you want to play on Miss Vangie as a seed and tell me where the

37:02.240 --> 37:08.760
fucking redstone is cuz I can barely find iron okay so it's just like getting

37:08.760 --> 37:11.600
into the mines like I mean I could just dig a hole in the floor and get in the

37:11.600 --> 37:14.320
mines that way but we all know that's not safe because you could dig a hole in

37:14.320 --> 37:19.160
the floor and then you fall through your death right right well okay yeah you

37:19.160 --> 37:22.440
could there you do it you do a gradual standing then of course now they have

37:22.440 --> 37:25.160
also you know you still have the silverfish that end up in there and

37:25.160 --> 37:29.600
that's a pain in the ass yeah Elmore chart in our chat says digging holes in

37:29.600 --> 37:33.840
Minecraft is oddly satisfying that's that's the reward I get from it too like

37:33.840 --> 37:37.800
all I've really done on Miss Vangie world right now is I've built like just

37:37.800 --> 37:40.920
I did find a place to go underground that I kind of like and I've just built

37:40.920 --> 37:45.520
this tunnel in wonder it's just a giant tunnel because I'm like at some point

37:45.520 --> 37:49.680
I'm gonna tunnel into something good well you know what yet to happen you

37:49.680 --> 37:54.440
know what my homes are like the house I had back on the old server it was this

37:54.440 --> 37:58.200
underground network of tunnels like a big maze yeah and I knew how to get

37:58.200 --> 38:02.760
through it but like the opening was like a glass shrine I the door I also

38:02.760 --> 38:06.400
always forget like there is nothing wrong with setting up your home

38:06.400 --> 38:10.560
underground you can set up an easy base underground you just have to dig

38:10.560 --> 38:13.320
yourself the tiniest little hole with the door to bed and you can keep

38:13.320 --> 38:16.800
yourself safe I like I tend to when I'm starting off just into the side of a

38:16.800 --> 38:22.000
mountain because then oh that's smart to see I need to play smarter and do

38:22.000 --> 38:25.600
something like that where I just build or if all else fails like the very

38:25.640 --> 38:28.840
first times we used to play if all else fails you just run out of time you just

38:28.840 --> 38:36.200
build a tower straight up and just wait it out I like that that's good not go go

38:36.200 --> 38:40.480
underground be the dwarves were the dwarves knew something all right anyway

38:40.480 --> 38:45.200
that's it for my gaming week let's get into some gaming news oh I'll quickly

38:45.200 --> 38:49.000
say of course as always follow us on twitter twitter.com slash olr we're also

38:49.000 --> 38:54.200
on facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and anything else I need to

38:54.200 --> 38:57.280
shout out I don't think so I think we were ready to get into some news so

38:57.280 --> 39:04.480
let's do it Loki start us off all right so as I kind of alluded to earlier do

39:04.480 --> 39:08.120
you know a lot of these games are going this whole battle royale route because

39:08.120 --> 39:11.800
of course that's the hot new thing right now so which two people are gonna jump

39:11.800 --> 39:15.720
on the bandwagon first why of course it's gonna be the two big FPS

39:15.720 --> 39:22.200
franchises Call of Duty in battlefield so Call of Duty the official announcement

39:22.200 --> 39:27.600
hasn't come out yet they're gonna be teasing that I guess on May 17th but

39:27.600 --> 39:33.520
from apparently people that are in the known different sources that people had

39:33.520 --> 39:39.240
are saying that the game is not gonna have a single-player campaign like the

39:39.240 --> 39:42.120
other games they said that there's basically gonna be focused on

39:42.120 --> 39:46.120
multiplayer but they will have like some sort of zombies thing that's gonna

39:46.120 --> 39:50.560
happen for the single-player portion and that kind of weird too because when you

39:50.560 --> 39:54.920
hear that the other rumor that was out there was that modern warfare 2

39:54.920 --> 40:02.800
remastered is not gonna have multiplayer it's like but why are you why I know why

40:02.800 --> 40:08.160
because they're gonna sell that shit fucking separate later and that's still

40:08.160 --> 40:11.420
you know head scratching but that's something that they're probably gonna do

40:11.420 --> 40:16.160
I'm saying with battlefield battlefield is something that they're looking at

40:16.160 --> 40:24.640
possibly doing like a battle royale type 4 as well so I forgot I left a game

40:24.640 --> 40:27.160
out of my gaming week do you know what else I played this week

40:27.160 --> 40:31.280
fortnight for night yeah I was I wasn't gonna detract from your story for no

40:31.280 --> 40:35.400
reason the battle royale talk made me think I tried fortnight this week do you

40:35.400 --> 40:38.340
want to hear about my experience with fortnight how's that okay so I don't

40:38.340 --> 40:42.960
know I've watched people play fortnight I've watched people play pub G so I was

40:42.960 --> 40:46.040
like alright well I have for tonight it's installed on my PC I think I

40:46.040 --> 40:49.680
installed it I may have done a stream like early early early on or something I

40:49.680 --> 40:53.040
don't remember I don't remember any of it so I was like alright I'm gonna fire

40:53.040 --> 40:57.720
up fortnight let's do it and so I I set it up and I'm like where's the tutorial

40:57.720 --> 41:01.280
how do I learn how to play and I'm like alright well I'm just gonna start maybe

41:01.280 --> 41:05.320
it sets you in an intro level before you know I went right into a game that was

41:05.320 --> 41:10.600
you know one versus 98 I'm assuming two people didn't make it so I get in there

41:10.600 --> 41:13.800
and I'm like alright well I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing it's like

41:13.800 --> 41:18.520
get out of the bus and I'm like how we get on man and then I'm falling slowly

41:18.520 --> 41:21.560
and I'm like why are all these other people falling faster than me and oh oh

41:21.560 --> 41:25.000
you have to you have to like steer it so I finally figured it out and I landed on

41:25.000 --> 41:28.640
the ground and I was like in this open field and I'm like oh fuck this is a

41:28.640 --> 41:31.640
terrible place to be so I'm like run to a house run to a house so I found a

41:31.640 --> 41:35.600
house I found a barn or something I found a gun and then I was like oh oh

41:35.600 --> 41:38.440
there's a gun up there I want I want I can't get it I'm like wait you can build

41:38.440 --> 41:42.560
stairs right and so I built stairs to get the gun and I'm like okay I did it

41:42.560 --> 41:45.680
I did it and then like oh shit I hear somebody okay here's the main nearby oh

41:45.680 --> 41:48.400
they went in the house they went in the house I ran over the house I opened the

41:48.400 --> 41:52.320
door to the house and I instantly got shotgun to death and I came in 53rd

41:52.320 --> 41:58.240
place and I was like well that was a fortnight Bob what didn't you ever watch

41:58.240 --> 42:02.840
battle royale of course I watched battle royale you don't run to the house you'd

42:02.840 --> 42:06.560
let them come to you and that's exactly what this person did they knew I was

42:06.560 --> 42:10.600
there and they waited for my stupid ass to open the door now this is fortnight

42:10.600 --> 42:13.680
what you do is you build a giant platform in the sky and you snipe

42:13.680 --> 42:17.400
everybody from the sky but then you're you're sitting there with your ass out

42:17.400 --> 42:23.400
in the sky build you build like walls around it and stuff you gotcha fine

42:23.400 --> 42:27.880
phantasm chat says newbie I didn't know what I was doing like fortnight well

42:27.880 --> 42:31.320
technically yes that is the definition because he was a newbie to the game yes

42:31.320 --> 42:35.720
and fortnight doesn't exactly tell you here is how you play fortnight and I was

42:35.720 --> 42:40.760
like alright so trial by fucking fire I'm still happy I came in 53rd but that

42:40.760 --> 42:43.920
must mean like a bunch of people probably plunged well no you know what

42:43.920 --> 42:48.200
it was I stayed alive running around going how do I build this staircase to

42:48.200 --> 42:53.200
this gut is it this button is this so as I'm sitting there being a dumbass other

42:53.200 --> 42:56.120
people are getting picked off because I'm sure there's got to be areas where

42:56.120 --> 42:59.000
like tons of people try to swarm it right that's got to be what happens in

42:59.000 --> 43:07.160
for tonight just remember in every race someone comes in last place to register

43:07.160 --> 43:11.160
participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at fog network calm

43:11.160 --> 43:18.140
use the passphrase English I also watched a stream of fortnight because

43:18.140 --> 43:21.520
one of my buddies from ingress is getting more and more into like game

43:21.520 --> 43:25.600
streaming so he was playing fortnight from his PlayStation 4 so I watched him

43:25.880 --> 43:32.320
and he was laughing so fucking hard because he was playing fortnight on

43:32.320 --> 43:35.640
PlayStation 4 and he was in team mode I guess there's a team yeah you can do

43:35.640 --> 43:40.680
teams his entire team was like 10 year old dudes and like you could hear

43:40.680 --> 43:48.360
parents in the background all this stuff and they're and I'm like I'm like

43:48.360 --> 43:52.240
sitting there with my mouth ajar going like where what what where is your

43:52.240 --> 43:56.960
babysitter where and like and like did the whole time my friend Chris is just

43:56.960 --> 43:59.720
sitting there like trying to be like super calm like you guys need to come

43:59.720 --> 44:01.720
over to the house where are you guys right now because you're gonna get

44:01.720 --> 44:04.560
sniped off it's like trying to be cool and calm and collected I'm like I would

44:04.560 --> 44:09.880
not be able to handle this I would be like hilarious where it made for a

44:09.880 --> 44:13.560
really funny stream which I think and this is why twitch is popular yeah

44:13.560 --> 44:18.280
because it's because there is not as many screaming crazy people you know in

44:18.280 --> 44:24.640
single-player RPGs you haven't seen me play RPGs then we need to see what

44:24.640 --> 44:28.640
happens when you play fortnight dark saga that may not happen it doesn't

44:28.640 --> 44:31.200
sound like something I'd enjoy it's not first-person though for what it's it's

44:31.200 --> 44:38.160
free though it is free free if you hate it who cares you lose anything time time

44:38.160 --> 44:42.760
is a precious commodity that no one will ever get back time is valuable god damn

44:42.760 --> 44:49.800
it anyway uh let's see Bobby Blackwell says it's usually me who's last place in

44:49.800 --> 44:54.320
the race see Mario Kart 8 Bobby I bet if you tried fortnight all you'd have to do

44:54.320 --> 44:57.440
is hide like a little bitch and you'd come in like all right Bobby somewhere

44:57.440 --> 45:02.360
someday I'll get a switch and then maybe you won't be last place or maybe it will

45:02.360 --> 45:05.640
I don't know you know it would make me play a game like that if it was branded

45:05.640 --> 45:11.120
hunter Hunger Games well I'm sure you had like all of the things in the

45:11.120 --> 45:14.400
Hunger Games let's go back to Loki's story I'm sure it's coming because

45:14.400 --> 45:19.120
everybody's battle royale-ing all the things now like I said I would represent

45:19.120 --> 45:22.640
my district I saw this really funny meme because you know now it's the time of

45:22.640 --> 45:26.360
year where everybody's doing e3 leaks e3 leaks so somebody put this meme online

45:26.360 --> 45:31.080
that was like check out this awesome e3 leak it was a slide where everything had

45:31.080 --> 45:35.320
like a battle royale mode right yeah this war like 100 yeah I was like Sims

45:35.320 --> 45:38.400
battle royale but then the one that made me laugh really hard was that had Yoshi's

45:38.440 --> 45:42.640
murder island in the corner and I was like I think I replied and I put if

45:42.640 --> 45:47.100
Yoshi's murder island was a real game I would throw my Sony and Microsoft

45:47.100 --> 45:51.360
systems in the garbage like there would be no need for them anymore I would play

45:51.360 --> 45:55.520
nothing but Yoshi's murder island would you would you dark cycle would you play

45:55.520 --> 46:02.640
Yoshi's murder island maybe see Nintendo 100 Yoshi's one survives I'm like Kirby

46:02.640 --> 46:09.600
battle royale where your goal is just to eat the other curbies what were you

46:09.600 --> 46:14.640
saying I was just gonna say you know if Nintendo was under new management you

46:14.640 --> 46:19.760
know this one a really adult route I'd be down anything's possible but right

46:19.760 --> 46:23.080
now it's all about labo which I know we talked a little bit about God of War at

46:23.080 --> 46:26.520
the top of the show we didn't really address labo came out and there's

46:26.520 --> 46:30.120
another thing that's big on twitch right now is people making their cardboard

46:30.120 --> 46:35.800
stuff I I didn't get labo because I am still sitting here going 60 bucks for

46:35.800 --> 46:40.640
what a cardboard piano I mean yes it looks cool but it's technically $60 it's

46:40.640 --> 46:46.920
yeah 16 and $80 for a robot yeah like and again I'm not hating on labo like if

46:46.920 --> 46:52.360
I had kids I would be buying this for my kids it's awesome but I don't I have mr.

46:52.360 --> 46:55.940
smoosh and mr. smoosh would just claw at the car he would chew it yeah well

46:55.940 --> 46:59.660
Midna choose cardboard would try to live in it Midna likes to eat boxes so

46:59.660 --> 47:05.740
well you can make a house out of like the variety set yeah he can go squish

47:05.740 --> 47:08.740
himself in the house yeah I think the only one of those I'd be interested in

47:08.740 --> 47:12.420
it well the piano one is cool but I'd want to do the rock-em-sock-em robots

47:12.420 --> 47:16.620
one because that game actually kind of looks fun yeah I mean I'm gonna wait and

47:16.620 --> 47:19.160
see what happens with this whole labo thing I'm sure they'll be you know

47:19.160 --> 47:22.060
especially if they start having more like third parties get in on it and it's

47:22.060 --> 47:24.780
like oh we're making all these peripherals out of cardboard because the

47:24.780 --> 47:28.540
little controllers are awesome and do all these things I'll be very curious

47:28.540 --> 47:32.260
to see what happens with that in the future anyway let's talk about another

47:32.260 --> 47:37.500
story that has to do with puzzle fighter you know there's a puzzle fighter iOS

47:37.500 --> 47:40.260
game and I think dark soccer you've mentioned this before I know I checked

47:40.260 --> 47:44.340
it out briefly I didn't really yeah I didn't really care for it it just again

47:44.340 --> 47:48.940
you can't control on the phone the same way you can with a tangible controller

47:48.940 --> 47:52.580
and that's what does it for me well apparently puzzle fighter not having a

47:52.580 --> 47:57.220
lot of success anywhere because Capcom has announced the server will be shutting

47:57.220 --> 48:02.860
down for the game July 31st 2018 the game will be removed from the app stores

48:02.860 --> 48:11.340
on July 1st this game just fucking came out like not even a year ago so the

48:11.340 --> 48:16.360
shelf life of a what do they call these games games mobile service games as a

48:16.360 --> 48:20.840
service now is eight months long and eight eight months service and you guys

48:20.840 --> 48:25.720
thought me Tomo was bad is me Tomo officially dead now no I'm still going

48:25.720 --> 48:29.200
on and I think through me okay I've actually been kind of enjoying me Tomo

48:29.200 --> 48:35.280
now that I have all this money no right yeah so but yeah puzzle fighter coming

48:35.280 --> 48:39.000
to an end before it even really got started what made this puzzle fighter

48:39.000 --> 48:44.180
different it had other Capcom characters in it not just Street Fighter and dark

48:44.180 --> 48:47.980
stalkers like the original 90s puzzle fighter did which was awesome so make it

48:47.980 --> 48:52.500
a free-to-play game put it out on a console didn't we have a story on the

48:52.500 --> 48:56.620
show like two weeks ago that was like puzzle fighter got rated for switch and

48:56.620 --> 49:00.580
stuff so is that just where they're gonna go with it maybe cuz it would make

49:00.580 --> 49:04.260
a lot more sense but still if I had spent money on this game oh my god after

49:04.260 --> 49:07.380
eight months they're gonna pull the plug when you spent money on it like I'd be

49:07.380 --> 49:12.780
kind of pissed Oh Eames as a service no one ever said the service had to be good

49:13.020 --> 49:18.660
and that's again when I hear stuff about like anthem and stuff I'm like well you

49:18.660 --> 49:21.460
know now eight months is the new precedent for the minimum amount well

49:21.460 --> 49:26.260
we look yeah look at like it was a destiny one and you know destiny to

49:26.260 --> 49:31.340
eventually gonna go down to I mean it's only a matter of time with these online

49:31.340 --> 49:35.100
games that don't have a single player is like what's the point they're gonna be

49:35.100 --> 49:40.100
complete garbage it's gonna be as good as an AOL CD at some point do we need

49:40.180 --> 49:45.420
game companies to start saying like I almost kind of want and you know Apple

49:45.420 --> 49:48.820
could Apple could really push this if they wanted to because they did it with

49:48.820 --> 49:52.140
a loot box thing remember they started saying if you're gonna put something

49:52.140 --> 49:55.500
with loot boxes in our store you have to disclose that they started doing that

49:55.500 --> 49:59.900
when the whole battlefront thing happened couldn't Apple say like you

49:59.900 --> 50:05.000
need to start putting a guarantee through date a service is good through

50:05.080 --> 50:08.880
XYZ date on it well this is a free-to-play game so I don't really think

50:08.880 --> 50:14.480
that um usually though there are things about limited price limited sale on the

50:14.480 --> 50:18.320
App Store so I think that at least anything that you'd acquire through the

50:18.320 --> 50:21.280
App Store is gonna have some kind of disclaimer on it but aren't we at the

50:21.280 --> 50:24.920
point where like you know game companies maybe need to start calling out oh well

50:24.920 --> 50:28.160
if you're gonna drop real money or stuff on this we're gonna guarantee our

50:28.160 --> 50:32.460
services are gonna be good through XYZ day I mean the only reason we all know

50:32.460 --> 50:36.460
we keep playing Pokemon go and spending money on Pokemon go as we know that

50:36.460 --> 50:40.420
game is done phenomenally well it continues to do well no matter what you

50:40.420 --> 50:43.880
know you know keyboard blogger people that don't actually play the game are

50:43.880 --> 50:47.100
telling you because this community day still do very well that game is gonna be

50:47.100 --> 50:51.780
running for a very long time you know we know that but I'm starting to distrust

50:51.780 --> 50:54.860
some of these other upcoming games what we have what we're gonna have a

50:54.860 --> 50:59.180
Ghostbusters AR game coming out right I'll check it out that sounds fun though

50:59.180 --> 51:04.220
but how long do we know it's gonna be you know like Ghostbusters if the last

51:04.220 --> 51:08.380
Ghostbusters movie did not come out I might be all down for like anything

51:08.380 --> 51:12.380
Ghostbusters but like it feels like Sony's just trying to milk that cow to

51:12.380 --> 51:17.060
death and I just don't I don't want to touch anything Ghostbusters brand

51:17.060 --> 51:22.020
anymore it's like it's ruined it for me not because of the movie the movie which

51:22.020 --> 51:26.420
is kind of it seemed like they didn't put much effort into it's just a cop

51:26.420 --> 51:30.860
reboot copy of the first one just gender swapping everything the cast

51:30.860 --> 51:34.300
which I don't really care it's just no effort into it but like all the other

51:34.300 --> 51:38.900
games associated with it have been shit that they've had a VR game that was not

51:38.900 --> 51:44.540
good they had a non VR game that was not good so the ghost so the Ghostbusters

51:44.540 --> 51:48.420
gaming franchise hasn't been good since the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 days

51:48.420 --> 51:51.340
because those games were fucking fire like those games were awesome the

51:51.340 --> 51:55.940
original Ghostbusters game they had also there's a game that was as I forget what

51:55.940 --> 51:59.580
the title of the game was but there's a game that came out not it was a few

51:59.580 --> 52:04.140
years ago which was basically the equivalent of a Ghostbusters 3 because

52:04.140 --> 52:08.620
they had all the original cast so there was that I think that's the one dungeon

52:08.620 --> 52:12.900
Buster's referring to 2009 Ghostbusters yeah so that one was good but like

52:12.900 --> 52:17.140
everything else that's come after it is not so great I'll check it out because

52:17.140 --> 52:22.780
it's probably gonna be free but yeah I don't know everybody wants a piece of

52:22.780 --> 52:28.100
that Pokemon go money yeah much like Pokemon go battle royale there we go

52:28.100 --> 52:33.300
I've struck it rich now but like an AR game battle royale real world like I

52:33.300 --> 52:38.620
would be super into that like like I ingress is an intense game because it's

52:38.620 --> 52:46.860
PvP but it's also like not actually like PvP like I can't fucking lay traps in

52:46.860 --> 52:51.580
ingress or like do things to really like directly disable the other players like

52:51.580 --> 52:55.180
it's not really like intensely PvP like that directly to say well we're talking

52:55.180 --> 52:58.860
like a Tonya Harding situation oh no no because that would be unacceptable in

52:58.860 --> 53:01.620
the real world but you know what I mean like what if what if there was an item

53:01.620 --> 53:04.340
that you could like let's say a mine that you lay on the ground and if

53:04.340 --> 53:08.940
another player walks over that mine they are they can't fire bursters for 30

53:08.940 --> 53:14.380
minutes or something there's nothing turrets everywhere yeah so cuz you know

53:14.380 --> 53:20.340
I'd be like oh yeah I know you know I wouldn't do it to my stuff I would put

53:20.340 --> 53:23.860
it on their stuff like I'd be like I know you're at this portal every single

53:23.860 --> 53:27.940
day so I'm gonna just put a bunch of crap we're aware of where your place of

53:27.940 --> 53:33.020
employment is just feel free to like scatter that shit around all right

53:33.020 --> 53:36.900
anyway let's move on to some more stories dark soccer you got a pretty big

53:36.900 --> 53:41.100
deal story lots of people were talking about this week yeah given that I brought

53:41.100 --> 53:46.060
up fire watch during my class not my classic game but the the games that I

53:46.060 --> 53:51.540
was playing this one kind of actually hit me they basically the developer

53:51.540 --> 53:59.380
campo Santo was acquired by valve it's 12 employees and the quote is they

53:59.380 --> 54:04.260
agreed to join valve and maintain our jobs as video game developers and

54:04.260 --> 54:10.540
continue product on our current project in the valley of the gods so yeah valve

54:10.540 --> 54:14.660
acquired them so now we can't see valve isn't making games anymore because

54:14.660 --> 54:18.020
they've just acquired people who are making games and in the valley of the

54:18.020 --> 54:23.500
gods is going to be a first-person adventure set 1920s Egypt and they're

54:23.500 --> 54:28.220
still supporting fire watch so it's pretty interesting it's actually made

54:28.220 --> 54:36.260
from the company was developers from clay and telltale so I guess it's

54:36.260 --> 54:44.020
something you know maybe we'll get a half-life 3 by them I don't know no no

54:44.060 --> 54:49.500
probably not but still I mean it's good to know that I mean valve you know at

54:49.500 --> 54:53.980
least sees talent in them and sees that these would be good people to add on to

54:53.980 --> 54:58.700
their staff I mean I just hope that they'll be able to keep performing like

54:58.700 --> 55:03.420
that be able to keep doing good games well I think the good news is that maybe

55:03.420 --> 55:08.060
with this valve you know oversight will get a fire watch too but you will never

55:08.060 --> 55:12.340
ever ever get a fire watch 3 so don't get your hopes up well you know if they

55:12.340 --> 55:15.740
do it a fire watch 2 they should actually put a lot more animation into

55:15.740 --> 55:19.500
their scenery instead of it having me so static but other than that for it being

55:19.500 --> 55:24.380
a group of 12 people making the game it wasn't bad and did you did you play it

55:24.380 --> 55:31.940
no I didn't I thought it was really good Rob says he loved it from the other room

55:31.940 --> 55:38.700
but I don't know if it was an acquisition or if it was more like a

55:38.740 --> 55:44.820
full merger it seems to me like more like it's coming off as a a adoption and

55:44.820 --> 55:49.140
less of a full acquisition since you brought up Kirby battle royale earlier

55:49.140 --> 55:54.620
this sounds like a curbing basically valve is inhaled them and absorb their

55:54.620 --> 55:58.820
powers yes that is what's if they've been their rogue they've been correct

55:58.820 --> 56:01.540
they're like they're at rogue can we can we use that for now on when a game

56:01.540 --> 56:05.300
company gets curbied they're getting curbied okay they're sucked up and and

56:05.460 --> 56:11.780
sometimes they could get spit out as a as you know a projectile so yeah that's

56:11.780 --> 56:17.780
EA EA inhales them and then spits them out in a useless form well maybe but

56:17.780 --> 56:22.140
projectiles are useful attacks in Kirby so yes if they were spit out in a

56:22.140 --> 56:29.700
useless form it would just be like an egg like Yoshi pooping an egg no it'd

56:29.700 --> 56:35.540
just be a shit it's just it's just a monster dump that's all anyway moving on

56:35.540 --> 56:39.540
all right well you know this happens sometimes smaller studios get absorbed

56:39.540 --> 56:43.100
by bigger ones it's just interesting that it's valve I think in this case you

56:43.100 --> 56:48.060
know we just haven't heard of valve acquiring a lot of companies lately so

56:48.060 --> 56:56.100
yay to valve making games again I guess by proxy all right moving on so since

56:56.100 --> 56:58.980
we were talking about Minecraft a little bit earlier there is a situation where

56:58.980 --> 57:01.980
apparently since one of the things you probably noticed Rob when you went into

57:01.980 --> 57:06.660
the store or into Minecraft is there's a store now you can buy skins and

57:06.660 --> 57:10.220
everything that people make and you can actually sell them and make some money

57:10.220 --> 57:15.700
off of it as well I did notice that because I was like where is all the 4k

57:15.700 --> 57:20.580
stuff that Microsoft was talking about at the last e3 I don't think that's ever

57:20.580 --> 57:23.820
come out it never yeah it still is not came out they have that it's like the

57:23.820 --> 57:27.540
super awesome super duper graphics pack or whatever is supposed to be concurrent

57:27.540 --> 57:32.140
with the 4k and it kept getting pushed back and it I think the latest updates

57:32.140 --> 57:35.380
was may where they were looking at so yeah all that stuff is still not out

57:35.380 --> 57:39.820
because the 4k I think is a free update but they're anticipating a lot of people

57:39.820 --> 57:44.220
are gonna buy this well I just want the nicer graphics just even not necessarily

57:44.220 --> 57:48.740
4k because I don't have a 4k monitor on my laptop but I'll take the super duper

57:48.740 --> 57:52.700
take whatever I can get yeah which is it's so funny to be sitting here going

57:52.700 --> 57:58.180
minecraft 4k super duper but it is especially you know in the windows 10

57:58.180 --> 58:01.340
where you have such an awesome like distance draw and everything it is it is

58:01.340 --> 58:05.780
really impressive you know for what it is for what it is so apparently anyways

58:05.780 --> 58:09.660
since people can't upload their own skins that they make to the store and

58:09.660 --> 58:13.780
try to sell them some people are uploading some malicious skins to the

58:13.780 --> 58:19.020
storefront that were basically PNG files that had malicious code inside of them

58:19.020 --> 58:23.820
that would cause malware to appear on this on any system that they're run on

58:23.820 --> 58:29.700
so there was three skins that they identified they were affected by it and

58:29.700 --> 58:35.020
looks like there's like a yellow diving suit some blue hoodie thing and some

58:35.020 --> 58:42.020
guides I don't know covered in colors for some reason anyways so they've

58:42.020 --> 58:48.740
caught this and remove them and my ground is basically said that the

58:48.740 --> 58:52.700
minecraft players that upload skin you know as a PNG file they can contain

58:52.700 --> 58:56.700
malicious code this code would not be run or read by the game itself while

58:56.700 --> 59:00.700
your antivirus software might detect this code and alert you to its presence

59:00.700 --> 59:04.380
the code would not be able to run by itself but they're saying that the

59:04.380 --> 59:11.260
people 50,000 users got infected by this of the apparently 74 million players and

59:11.300 --> 59:15.180
with that you know they received messages and their minecraft accounts

59:15.180 --> 59:19.980
saying you know your ass got glued you have maxed out your internet usage for a

59:19.980 --> 59:25.620
lifetime and you're nailed but a new computer this is a piece of shit

59:25.620 --> 59:31.700
Wow it seems like I told them kitty thing to do it so just be careful or

59:31.700 --> 59:36.300
maybe just hold off on buying skins you don't really know now I'm sitting here

59:36.300 --> 59:39.820
going why haven't we made a vog skin like try to try to make a little side

59:39.900 --> 59:45.460
coin for vog maybe we need to get on that a little like a little pack that

59:45.460 --> 59:49.460
has like a vog shirt and a maybe a bobby shirt I'm assuming he'd be down for this

59:49.460 --> 59:54.260
a bobby black wolf logo shirt maybe something for olr sir ferret first mr.

59:54.260 --> 59:58.420
smoocher I'll sell smooches likeness why not also also I will sell out mr. smoosh

59:58.420 --> 01:00:03.460
to the highest bidder just there's not the cat himself I would never anyway

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:09.100
alright moving on let's talk about again another story about fortnight but this

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:13.540
one's a little bit different because it involves cliff B who is no longer with

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:16.620
epic games he was probably most well-known when he was at epic games

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:21.660
but he actually left epic in 2012 to do a new company that is called boss key

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:27.060
boss key made a game called law breakers that I think kind of came and went in it

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:32.140
yeah they've got their that's a game now radical heights is that new game their

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:35.940
own type of battle royale game that's very like I just looked at it and I was

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:41.380
like oh this is a Loki game no not really I did it doesn't look that great

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:44.740
I don't know really cuz it's all like neon I love that they have like a little

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:48.660
arcade machine in the screen yeah you like taco time you get money you pay for

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:52.020
stuff in like vending machines and I don't know I kind of thought it looked

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:55.700
cool although fantastic our chat said oh god radical heights what a joke all

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:59.920
right maybe I need to look into it a little more but anyway apparently cliff

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.900
went on Twitter and fired some shots at epic the company he used to work for

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:08.940
epic of course ended up making fortnight but cliff said in a tweet hey

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:14.460
at epic games could you please stop trying to hire away my team we just

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:19.420
launched radical heights on ue4 and are really happy with how it's going we have

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:22.220
plenty of ways to make it our own but they may never see the light of day if

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:26.520
they keep doing this apparently this move to attract boss key developers over

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:31.900
to fortnight is a little bit more of a recent thing hmm and also it's worth

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:35.500
noting both of these games are battle royale games that are that are bright

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.820
colorful they don't quite look like pub G pub G's a little more of the gritty

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:45.860
realistic kind of look these other games are very cartoony so apparently Bosque

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:50.880
has lost more than one employee to epic games recently former programmer William

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.820
McCarroll goes over to epic and replied to the tweet by saying it's presumptuous

01:01:54.820 --> 01:02:00.100
to suggest that epic is poaching employees with all due respect assuming

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:04.100
that epic is the one starting contact poaching is a bit presumptuous we've all

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:08.940
had our own reasons for making the choice to leave BK P Bosque for epic and

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:14.340
to act like we are commodities being stolen is a bit hurtful we are people

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:21.180
first and forenote most oh shit some drama is going down in the battle royale

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:27.380
world but anyway just kind of interesting I mean something we kind of

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:31.660
forget you know again there's a lot of people hard-working people to go beyond

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:35.980
making behind making these games and sometimes they leave for greener grass

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:40.500
somewhere else in the industry that sucks but like when it's funny those not

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:44.020
even necessarily this situation but you know how like blue holes kind of pissed

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:47.940
off it you know they said Fortnite copied their formula wait till all the

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:53.660
other ones come out wait till how pissed they are then I hope they're working on

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:58.580
pub g2 or something else to really you know or some other type of like you know

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:02.460
to keep themselves hey hey don't forget about us don't forget about us cuz yeah

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:05.860
I think you're right like they're just gonna get more and more upset as this

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:10.780
pool gets more and more diluted which is gonna be a theme at this year's e3

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:15.900
absolutely I mean I know that picture that was going around on Twitter was

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:21.060
just a joke but there's some truth in that you can't chase you can't chase

01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:24.900
what's popular you got to be the trendsetter I mean that's think of

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:28.860
something unique yeah what's a new spin you can put on by the because that's

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:33.340
kind of what it is like you you have the game that comes out and if it's pretty

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:37.820
unique and stuff granted pub G wasn't the first battle battle royale game but

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:41.740
you know then Fortnite comes out and kind of did it better and so now they're

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:45.820
the pop more popular one well some would argue if it's really better pub G still

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:50.540
has many many fans true I think the free-to-play aspect of it though is

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:54.260
better because at least you know there's not much to invest there that's

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:59.420
true but I think that everybody's gonna try to get a piece of that pie now and

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:02.420
it's just are they gonna be really innovating on this or is it just gonna

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:09.580
be kind of like me too me too yeah yeah yeah maybe what the pub G folks was

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:13.720
her name blue blue hole what they need to do is team up with Nintendo and make

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:17.580
a game called Yoshi's murder island and then blue hole will be at the top of

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:21.700
their game so I think that's what needs to happen in that meanwhile dark soccer

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:26.260
would be up for us in the news well I'm excited and waiting for Deadpool 2 and

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:32.100
I'm going to be super happy to watch it but the director is adapting a video

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:38.140
game and I don't know the last dead both I guess the Deadpool game that came out

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:44.100
was hilarious but not great it controlled really crap I don't know I

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:46.940
watched the cutscenes on that game I didn't actually play the game and I was

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:50.860
fucking laughing my ass off I was on the first mission and it was just impossibly

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:56.060
hard to control although I loved going around this house that was funny I just

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.780
remembered there was a scene though where he had a sentinels foot it was a

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:04.420
foot or a hand and he was flying around in it with a dog and he ended up killing

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:08.900
one of the bad guys that's how he just like the big bad guys all zoom just

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:15.420
slammed it down on him and it was hilarious but at any rate the director

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:25.020
David leech is going to be directing the video game adoption so he also is

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:32.740
directing the division that's based off of one of the Tom Clancy games so who

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:37.860
knows what'll happen but I hope that it controls better than the Deadpool game

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:44.540
did but has all the same hilariousness in it so apparently he's also doing

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:53.420
another fast and furious spin-off with the rock okay he's a busy busy guy well

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:58.100
when you make a movie like Deadpool you're probably pretty in demand I would

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:02.340
reckon so all right just a few more stories for you guys in the classic game

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:07.620
of the week so SNK is celebrating their 40th anniversary and so when a game

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.980
company celebrates its 40th anniversary what's that mean it's got to put out

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:14.700
another mini console obviously because that's the new thing that's the new

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:20.260
hotness so um it wasn't that long ago actually SNK kind of re-released the

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:24.580
Neo Geo they did like the little mini system with some games in there as well

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:29.940
but now they're planning on doing it kind of teasing it right now a new

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:36.740
compilation system perhaps basically says a new game machine and they have a

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:42.540
picture of something underneath like a looks like a cloak or something that

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:46.740
says Neo Geo so could we see like a Neo Geo mini with a bunch of Neo Geo games

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:52.420
in it I hope so and I hope it doesn't cost a Neo Geo price that's right that's

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.100
about it yeah I would so get a Neo Geo mini are you kidding that would be

01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:00.620
awesome be careful the other ones had really shitty emulation in them okay

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:04.380
assuming it is a quality product especially if they come with like

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:08.020
actual like fighter stick type controllers or you can use like if you

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:12.020
had the real thing if you could use them on it yes that would be rad so yeah I

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:16.420
would so be down like and I would even pay like you know a slightly increased

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:20.260
price if those controllers are fucking bomb the controls are good and the

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:24.340
emulation is good then yeah for sure oh my god just as long as fatal fury

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:29.300
special isn't it I'm good and not real about a half fatal fury special not real

01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:33.780
about real that wasn't bad I didn't like real about but fatal very special I

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:37.780
think I have fatal either a fatal fury to or fatal fury special on Neo Geo well

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:42.220
I mean they're not that different very specials just all the one characters and

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:47.940
fatal very to basically yeah as my favorite he has my old Neo Geo system oh

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:54.340
really well cuz I had a MVS that was in my arcade cabin I bought that with a

01:07:54.380 --> 01:08:00.380
totally legit 68 and one cart that has all these different games in it and I

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:05.300
think I sent it to him with what they call that oh is that when all the

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:09.180
systems fried in the storm well no it was it was with a because I have a bunch

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:15.900
of these very column basically a way to hook up arcade hardware to TVs he says

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:19.720
a super gun super gun thank you I couldn't remember the name so I sent it

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:26.840
to him with a super gun to nice run all right cool cool all right well I would

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.640
so be down for like an SNK mini as long as you know again the quality is good

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.920
because you know they put out a ton of those games on PlayStation 4 and switch

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.440
and stuff those arcade archives but like the pools getting a little diluted it

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.920
would just be nice to have like one collection with everything in one place

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.240
but again the price has got to be right you know I don't want to pay like $500

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:48.440
unless I mean if it's a nice fucking cabinet would like like if it looks

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:52.040
like your little VPD cabinet but it's like a neo geo official thing like then

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.040
maybe I'd pay several hundred dollars for it but I'm assuming they're gonna

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.620
try to make something that maybe just plugs into an existing you know that has

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:01.760
neo geo games on it that's true that is true I have to have you figure out what

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:08.640
I am plugged on that okay that hasn't been on in a long time so anyway anyway

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:12.280
moving on we got one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:16.280
of the week and this one has to do with Sonic Mania Sonic Mania apparently got a

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:23.600
patch recently that is adding some new things they have done some animations to

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:27.280
transition stages because that was the feature in the old Sonic games was kind

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:31.000
of missing in Sonic Mania so now they have some new transitions that help out

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.040
the story this patch by the way it showed up on PlayStation 4 and I think

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.640
it was put out a little early but I'm assuming it'll be coming out for the

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.040
other systems very soon there's some other small features as well cutscenes

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.280
can be skipped menus have been changed additional moves from past games like

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:53.440
the insta shield the super peel out from Sonic CD and knuckles mode can be used

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.500
in save files and not just non save play you can also disable the time limit

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:02.200
which is pretty neat and you can do multiplayer without the stretch to

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:06.040
visuals so they've done a lot of little changes there to Sonic Mania to keep

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:10.920
that game exciting I thought Sonic Mania was a great little follow-up in the

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.440
Sonic franchise I'm excited to see it still getting some love all right

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:20.360
speaking of old games getting love every week here at Orange Laundry do we like

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.760
to jump into the gaming vault and dark soccer will find a game that she thinks

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:29.320
hey you should be checking this game out this is kind of a yeah I was gonna say

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:35.480
this is a very obscure game in a very obscure but in a popular series it's not

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:40.680
even that obscure it had a US release not on the system but it had it on

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.320
Gameboy on the Gameboy all right well let's get to it what is the classic

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:52.480
game of the week Rockman and Forte Mirei Mirei Kara no Chosha Chosensha and which

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:59.160
is Rockman and Forte challenger from the future it is developed by Capcom and

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:04.880
published by Bandai for the WonderSwan this particular one was only released

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:09.920
in Japan on the WonderSwan not even the WonderSwan color this is old school

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:16.200
and in this game of course it takes place in the year 20XX a group of robots

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:24.920
from the future called the dimensions attack Symphony City and there is one

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:30.440
robot Rockman who is trying to take care of everything called Rockman shadow and

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:35.520
he seems obsessed with destruction but the real Rockman is like this is fucked

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:44.120
up and tries to do something so anyway Wily sends Forte who we call base

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:50.760
over here to investigate as well so you can play as one or the other so in this

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:55.280
game there is some different control and actually my apologies it was the

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.280
original Rockman and Forte that came out on the Gameboy Advance as Mega Man and

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:06.240
base this one come out not this one yeah but basically Rockman plays you

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:13.560
know or Mega Man plays like he normally does but Forte has a rapid-fire standard

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:20.240
gun but it can't be fired while moving and he has a dash and a double jump

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:28.480
there's also another gameplay change from the earlier games the the robot

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:32.480
masters don't have a period of invincibility after being damaged you

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.400
can just keep pounding and pounding pounding and since the WonderSwan has a

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:41.120
third set of controls that are located above the traditional directional

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:47.720
controls you can play vertically so for example if you are playing on air con

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:51.240
man you are required to change how you hold it so that you can play the level

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:56.280
vertically a lot of that was in some of their puzzle games as well as the

01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:02.120
Klonoa game so you also have the bolt systems you can collect these bolts so

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:07.280
that you can buy different items and they are universal you know like extra

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:12.520
lives or exclusive items like Rockman being able to get Rush, Eddie, Tango and

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:18.960
Beat and Forte can get gospel who is known as trouble over here and reggae

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.320
that's a bird robot that was the last time it was seen was in a 1983 Famicom

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:28.240
game called wily and right no rock board that's paradise and maybe I'll

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:33.440
cover that at some point some people don't really like it some people super

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:39.560
like it I thought it was a pretty fun little game so that's it it is again

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:45.240
called Rockman and Forte Mirai Kata no Chosensha thank you for pronouncing it

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.840
one more time so I don't have to I will say I'm not familiar with this game I

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.640
mean I remember the Gameboy Advance you know I played your old roommate's copy

01:13:53.640 --> 01:14:00.200
of this Oh drama central room I'm a central roommate his class I blast from

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:04.400
the past that is how I played this game oh boy all right yeah I was gonna say

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:09.200
like I have a WonderSwan but just not this game but I gotta say I mean I

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:13.120
realized we don't always highlight the best games in classic games the week

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.520
just games you should be paying attention to and I think most people

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.960
probably don't even know this one exists unless you really pay a close attention

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:22.640
to Japanese gaming it's probably not the best looking Mega Man game it wasn't

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.240
really ranked as one of the best playing games either but but it's better

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:32.160
than that Mega Man PC game and it's really not a bad game I enjoyed it I

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:38.200
thought it was a fun game yeah but um it but mostly I when I played the game so I

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:44.000
could play through his forte so yeah not a bad game all right there it is your

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.660
classic a game of the week one more time Darzaga I just closed it Mirai Kata no

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:55.540
Chosensha yes that make a man on the WonderSwan yeah all right all right

01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:58.900

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:33.060
727 of our show it is April the 22nd of 2018 and our show is already in progress

01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:37.900
we've got to get to some rapid-fire news here so let's do it

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:42.360
Loki why don't you start us off some rapid-fire news yes so apparently the

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:47.200
lineup for next month's free games with gold has kind of leaked out there was an

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:53.040
unlisted video on the Xbox YouTube channel that showed basically what the

01:15:53.040 --> 01:16:00.160
lineup was so what we've got coming for May for me for the Xbox one May 1st to

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:06.520
the 31st we've got super mega baseball 2 and from May 16th to June 15th

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:12.880
Metal Gear Solid 5 the phantom pain that's a pretty awesome free game the

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.400
Xbox 360 games that are compatible with Xbox one we have streets of rage from

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:24.960
May 1st to the 15th and vanquish from the 16th of the 31st so not bad at all

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:30.040
yeah those are some really good picks yeah Mel yourself five she's yeah

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.920
pretty awesome wish I know a lot of people are really into as well so this

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:38.800
is uh it was a good day yeah speaking of Konami Konami is making a new

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.320
Castlevania game for iOS so they have a game called Castlevania grimoire of

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:50.320
souls that's in closed beta right now in Japan and apparently the game is set you

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.400
know like most other castle games in a world which Dracula has been completely

01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:01.800
erased but someone decides to resurrect him as always as always what's gonna be

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:08.400
kind of unique though so this is a to 2d game but it also supports co-op play for

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:13.120
up to four players so that's kind of cool yeah but it's on the phone how am I

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.400
gonna control it appropriately right yeah I get your point there really I

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:21.560
don't know I just like I get excited when I hear new Castlevania and then

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:26.160
it's oh but it's that I mean the game sounds good in theory but again how am I

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:29.600
supposed to control it on the phone well like a lot of companies they're very

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:33.120
lazy importing their stuff over I guess we'll see this come to the switch and

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:38.000
other platforms just the port of the iOS games well I mean if it's good then

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:42.400
fine that would be great yeah all right well speaking of the switch and games

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:46.040
that will be coming out on the switch the official Nintendo magazine actually

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:48.840
there's oh no there is an official Nintendo magazine I was like wait what I

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:52.440
thought they got rid of that no I think there is a in another in another country

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:56.080
there's another Nintendo magazine but anyways the Spanish edition of the

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:59.880
Nintendo magazine and there is a section on Pokemon for the switch it does

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:05.000
confirm that the eighth generation of Pokemon will be in this new switch game

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.320
so it is not like a reboot of gen 1 as some people have been speculating or

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:13.960
anything like that the article also mentions the game will be in 2018 or

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:19.040
later so it's not guaranteeing that it's gonna make this year but we'll see we'll

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:23.040
see you know they got to get it right also they are rethinking that there will

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:29.120
be new mechanics in this game so don't expect necessarily the same formula that

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:34.520
we saw before so anyway also one other thing that maybe goes with this a little

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.720
bit is that the company game freak has actually trademarked the term in Japan

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:46.320
anyway ultra shiny great as if the shiny addiction wasn't bad enough now we may

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.800
have ultra shinies we don't know what that means or anything like that but

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:53.360
maybe that's gonna be one of these new game mechanics and yes I'll be sure to

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:57.020
ask Shane all about it next time I see him although we just really don't know a

01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:00.400
lot right now outside of this term do you guys like hunting shinies and

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:05.640
Pokemon go no I never get them I never get me the order the hair days only

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:09.200
during the community and even during the community days like last time I got what

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:15.080
to I got one shiny all together oh and the egg event a lot of people actually

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.980
are really upset at me because I've actually hatched two shiny toga peas

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.960
both during that event so I have a shiny toga pea and a shiny toy get tick or

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:26.760
whatever it's called evolution which a lot of the local players are like you're

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:32.600
fucking lucky I've never seen a shiny Toby so I have one Toby I'll take it

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:38.000
and a pillow I'll take it JD and chat says I got a shiny mile today as part of

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:45.560
a raid lucky we show anyone hmm all right anyway also moving on some

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:48.680
information that you heard about in the intro to tonight's show it has to do

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:54.640
with a leaked video oh boy another leak from Microsoft and this shows what the

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:59.720
new Xbox Live avatars are gonna look like Microsoft needs depends they're

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:04.800
quite leaky anyway these characters we know they've been under redesigned for a

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.760
while we've seen some glimpses of what's gonna be but apparently now thanks to

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:12.320
this video we know there's gonna be dozens of eye shapes hairstyles costumes

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:17.000
moods meaning animations for your characters that's gonna be a new thing

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.840
this ties into some earlier rumors that there was gonna be like a career system

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:25.800
not achievements but like a career system that kind of runs side-by-side

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:31.760
with that for your profile and that this career system may actually unlock

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:39.280
customization items through loot boxes everybody's favorite but whatever they're

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:43.200
just avatars I mean who sounds like it's just loot boxes for gay achievements

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:48.120
which I'm fine I mean I have an Xbox Live avatar but my little picture is

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:53.960
still the olr logo that was for a short time on the 360 as part of like one of

01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:57.480
those like gamerscore blog packs we were very lucky enough during our time with

01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.960
all games we're actually in one of those pack you can't get it anymore though

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:04.040
sadly they delisted it from the store several years ago probably whatever we

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:09.340
sign was only gonna be valid for a few years so yeah if you don't have the olr

01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:13.320
icon sadly you'll never get it unless I don't know you take a picture or

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:20.040
something but I see a few I still have the PNG file for it yeah I put malicious

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.280
code in there so that you know when you run it in your system it puts all the

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.480
malware Bobby Blackwell says you can still get it I thought they delisted

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:31.840
them oh you just need to know someone with the pack on a USB stick okay so you

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:36.560
have to kind of do it that way you have to basically log in as somebody else and

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:39.640
download it or some of that or Bobby says you have it on a new I have it on a

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:43.640
USB stick so you can move it to a new 360 well that's good to know maybe

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:49.480
that's something we need to give away to listeners a USB stick with all the old

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:57.480
icons anyway how many of the shows in that pack are still on the air some of

01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:00.680
the all games should did dead pixel life have a picture in that because I know

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:04.680
they're still around but I don't know how many in that pack are still actually

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:09.600
on the air probably not a lot Oh video game outsiders was probably in that pack

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.920
too because they were with all games for a while so they were probably in it

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:17.480
too and I know they're still going so hmm interesting anyway um what else I

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:21.000
want to say about this oh no word on when the new avatars will launch but

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.800
everybody's probably guessing e3 would be a really good bet for that I'll be a

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:29.760
really really good bet as something they could say is going live right now is all

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.080
this avatar stuff at e3 dark saga we have for us before we get to releases

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:42.040
has some stuff well it looks like night trap is going to be coming on to the

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:50.220
switch thanks to limited run games so yay night trap isn't that good I know

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:54.760
it's like it was funny like the first 5,000 times we've heard that night

01:22:54.760 --> 01:23:01.080
Travis really joke now it's like okay it wasn't that good we're over it I heard

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:07.000
the funny part is though I heard it's rated T for teen I have no idea how they

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.320
pull that off with all the outrage that fucking game got back in the day it's T

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:16.440
for teen like how how about s for stupid

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:22.080
well anyway other news Kingdom hearts 3 is gonna have some minigames in it that

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:27.240
look like little Game & Watch games although when I was looking at it the

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:32.640
style of Mickey and Sora and many and all that look like the 30s era Mickey

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.120
but you've got like a little Game & Watch child screen that you're playing

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:41.560
them on so that's pretty funny but the little minigames are there's the barnyard

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:46.680
battle the carnival kid giant land and musical farmer I wish this article used

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:51.520
an Oxford comma so that I would know that giant land and musical farmer were

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:57.320
two different games but it looks kind of neat I mean I think it'll be fun it

01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:00.960
doesn't say anything about how it's accessed it's just in the trailer but it

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:04.920
looks cute I mean it'd be kind of neat if they did like some of these is like a

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:08.840
little Oh see it looks like he's actually playing a handheld system in

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:13.320
the game so maybe it's how you build up like more points or something you know

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:17.520
what else would be neat a release date well there's that although they did

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:22.720
confirm 2018 right so we know this is squares eventually where Enix is a big

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.280
release for this year yeah so don't expect that thought fancy seven thing

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:30.600
till next year it is what it is yeah I thought they did didn't what didn't like

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:35.160
Japan have a d23 type of thing and they confirmed it's this year yeah it was a

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:41.600
recent thing yes so I guess I guess we'll see with the next release anyway

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:46.080
um or with e3 I'm sure they'll talk about when that will be out anyway

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.640
because they announce the date does it mean they have to stick to that day

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.160

send your email stark Sakura what you got this first one was titled pinball so

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:59.120
I instantly wanted to read it once farsight studios irons out the licensing

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:03.720
for the pinball arcade for the switch I assume we won't be seeing an exclusive

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:08.480
translation of the got live Super Mario Brothers table that comes from Robert M

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:13.000
I'd love to see it yeah but it was terrible it wasn't wasn't there am I

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.400
wrong wasn't there two tables wasn't there a smaller kids table and then

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.800
there was like a big full-size I think that it was the same one but the kids

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:25.600
yeah huh I think it just really had to do with it just it was a short body

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:33.420
table anyway oh yeah not I think as far as as I know the only one was the you

01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:38.360
know the the short kid table was the pipe came out and shot the ball out yeah

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:43.640
yeah tables just weren't very good do any of these collections have the

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:49.160
return from Mars in there actually yes I know I've played that table in one of

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:54.040
these collections shit I don't remember which one it was it was revenge from

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.960
ours or whatever I don't remember because it was attacked from ours and

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.460
then the pinball 2000 was revenge from ours yes revenge from I thought the

01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:03.900
pinball 2000 version was in one of those packs but maybe I am confusing it with

01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:08.100
the old one yeah there weren't really too many of those pinball 2000 tables

01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:11.620
anyway maybe in our chat somebody knows over at live.vognetwork.com wasn't there

01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:17.940
only one other game they did the there was one other episode one oh that's

01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:20.980
right there was there's a Phantom Menace table in that same yeah I was

01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:24.420
that's right I mean it was a fun table if that movie hadn't been annoying as

01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:30.200
shit and you got to thwack Jar Jar Binks to the ball so that's always fun yes but

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:38.960
the next email here hey OLR crew AZHP here I've been behind on or is it as HP

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:46.200
I should ask I've just never bothered we always said AZHP okay or is it as it's

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:49.760
like that the cupid sound really I've been behind on the podcast for a few

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:53.520
months and as such haven't written in a while since my responses wouldn't be

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:57.280
very timely however one thing has cropped up fairly frequently in the past

01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:01.680
few months on your show that I had to address every time the subject of pub G

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:04.840
versus fortnight comes up many of the hosts are quick to say something to the

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:08.560
effect of pub G tried to pursue legal action against fortnight because

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:12.760
fortnight is doing better than pub G the reason pub G pursued legal action

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:16.640
against epic regarding fortnight is a little more nuanced than this

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:19.840
fortnight's marketing reference pub G directly when they announced their

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:26.440
battle royale mode this coupled with the fact that epic the makers of the unreal

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:30.760
engine which pub G runs on was releasing a free mode in their floundering game

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:35.840
and what was clearly a reactionary move to pub G success could be construed as a

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:39.560
conflict of interest as they could theoretically hold back engine

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:43.320
improvements to pub G in order to give their own game a competitive advantage

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:47.520
in the marketplace that being said if what you reported two weeks ago is true

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:51.040
in pub G is now pursuing legal action against other games for copying aspects

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:54.520
of their game that's a lot less defensible as Robin look you rightly

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:59.160
pointed out look and feel of the video game cannot be trademarked as proven in

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:03.000
the street fighter versus fighters history legal battle of the 1990s now

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.720
I'm not asking you guys to stop bagging on pub G if that's what you feel like

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:10.920
doing but I thought that I should chime in with extra information that you may

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:13.920
not have known about so you can all have the facts before choosing to criticize

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:19.240
them yours truly is HP for the record I haven't said shit about it well and to

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:23.960
be fair I'm not bagging on pub G I'm bagging on the executives and the things

01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:28.320
that they do and say and yes kind of goes in line with that I know pub G has

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:33.200
his fans I'm not gonna disrespect that you know just like we hardly ever talk

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:36.280
about sports games on the show but I recognize those games have their fans

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:39.400
and like you know they're super into it and that's cool but here's the other

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:44.520
thing like I understand the nuance with the engine specifically is I think the

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:49.840
thing that kind of differentiates this however to use other games in your games

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:53.200
marketing I don't think that is particularly anything new because I kind

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:57.320
of there was a legal case about that in the past well and I go I go back my head

01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:00.280
just goes back to you know again I'm dating myself here gonna I go back to

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:04.160
the old magazines with the Genesis does wouldn't intend don't you know that

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:09.440
whole thing right and then you know like I know those neo geo ads used to call

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.800
the shit out of the other game makers because their thing was so beefy

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:17.240
powerful and $1,000 but that's you know that was one thing these do so there'd

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:22.040
been a legal case on it in the past to where it was said that you can use

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:27.560
another game from another system as a point of comparison to advertise your

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:32.400
product right right but I I do realize where things get a little dicey now when

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.240
it comes to the engine and just kind of like you know where and I hell yeah

01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:40.040
fortnight this battle royale thing they added was like a last-ditch thing to

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:45.360
save their game it worked though mm-hmm like I mean we kind of have to be mad

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:50.320
because you didn't think about it well but the problem is they did think about

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:58.040
it but they didn't think about doing it for free okay so for tonight found a way

01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:02.520
to make it free and probably for that reason is why it's doing so more six

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:06.920
like I only checked it out cuz it was free if PUBG was free I probably would

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:13.080
have checked that out so not not to mention that there's been complaints

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:19.720
about you know there still being some kinks in the game in PUBG so dark to see

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:23.920
and Chad says didn't they do things like brand X in the 50s for that so they

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:28.400
still do that or like competitor brand or yeah because sometimes they just

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.200
simply don't want to name the other brand you know love competitor brand

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:35.760
competitors but then you also though now have like for example your cell phone

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:40.840
companies compared to X Network you know and they'll name them by name sure and

01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:44.600
like Coke and Pepsi always call each other out don't they mm-hmm yeah but

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.760
you're right I know what you're talking about with the brand X thing cuz

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:50.040
sometimes when it comes to like this makes me think of Batman I remember like

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:54.120
a catch-up thing where it's like this ketchup is better than nine out of ten

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:58.280
people prefer this ketchup to brand X oh it just makes me think of the the the

01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:03.240
scene in the 90s Batman with Jack Nicholson he's like they're using brand

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:09.560
X fantastic with a very fair counterpoint in our chat PUBG mobile is

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:14.120
free that's right it is free it's but it's mobile and you all know how I feel

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:18.440
about controlling something mobile but if it's free I should I did download it

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:22.240
and I launched it and that's as far as I got because I was like I wasn't on Wi-Fi

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:25.760
that's what it was I wasn't on Wi-Fi when I launched it I was like wait a

01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:31.200
minute this is not a game you want to play on on mobile data so I'll check

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:36.200
that out later though so last email that came in actually quite literally before

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:41.560
I loaded from when it opened the first mail to open the second so like in

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:48.200
before the buzzer right okay this comes from smash og through the website so

01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.000
people are still using that sup olr this is the first time I've been able to

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.320
listen live due to my work hours so that's pretty cool well thank you for

01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:00.280
listening like yeah thanks for being here anyway I think you have been over

01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.480
this topic before but refresh my memory what game releases this year are you

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:08.800
almost excited about for me it's Red Dead Redemption 2 for sure the first Red

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.640
Dead was one of the few games that I could actually play all the way through

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:18.720
was like binge watching a good TV series anyway how about you good question I'm

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:24.240
even if we and look let's be real in 727 episodes of olr we repeat stuff

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:27.760
sometimes it happens like fuck there's things where it's like did we just talk

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.000
about this four weeks ago but you know I don't know I don't remember last week

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.960
sometimes when you get together with the same group of people every time

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:40.960
sometimes the same topics come up it just happens so what games are you

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:44.320
looking forward to well Red Dead Redemption 2 has got to be on your list

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:52.280
as well yeah yeah of course anything else besides that one I was I was

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:58.040
looking forward to black ops 4 yeah that was until all the rumored news right now

01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:04.400
so I'm not looking forward to it now and I don't even know if I'd buy it even if

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:09.600
it was okay coming out cuz like I thought about I got like what was the

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:13.880
last game I think it advanced warfare and I was like oh yeah I'm gonna buy the

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:18.560
season pass and play online with all my friends and that was just all money

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:22.040
thrown away cuz I didn't end up playing it very much I played through the

01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:26.960
campaign campaign was fun but that's kind of all I play through those

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:32.880
nowadays is the campaign I mean I'll wait until e3 to hear what else is

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:36.080
coming out because I think a lot of that stuff I don't know what's in the

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:39.960
pipeline yeah that's the thing I kind of feel like you should ask this question

01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:44.680
again in June because we there's a lot of things that are probably coming out

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:49.640
this year that we don't know about yet so that'd be that for me though okay I

01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:52.800
got I got one more okay so crackdown three would be the other one okay

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:58.600
assuming it comes out ever I'm sure it will it's gotta be it's gotta be 2017 or

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:07.200
18 or 19 or 20 for me Kingdom Hearts 3 absolutely assuming they mean that 2018

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:11.760
date I would say Metroid Prime 4 if that was the thing that Nintendo was teasing

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:15.000
for this year that's kind of where we need e3 because I would also kind of put

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.040
Pokemon Gen 8 on that list for the switch I really want to see how Pokemon

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:21.880
goes to the switch so that would be on my list as well I'm gonna go to the

01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:26.200
mobile phone round two I am super curious about Harry Potter wizards unite

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:31.480
yes because that is of course you know it's Niantic isn't making the game I

01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:35.440
think it's port key games who's doing the other Harry Potter mobile game is

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:40.400
working with Niantic probably borrowing Niantic's portal network basically to

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:44.800
make the Harry Potter wizards unite game so I'm super curious about that and I

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:49.560
imagine that's gonna be a 2018 game I'm curious about the Mario Kart mobile game

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:54.920
oh I forgot it was a thing Jamie shit we probably Animal Crossing oh you you're

01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:57.960

dark Sakura and don't fuck it up alright let's get to some more news before we

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:32.240
get to the skype line Loki alright so there's a game called halo online that

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:40.680
was announced back in I think 2015 so the farthest it went was actually it did

01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:47.080
a beta test in Russia in 2015 but it didn't really get much further than that

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:53.320
but apparently there's been a mod project going on called El Dorado and

01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:58.280
they've been working on basic El Dorado like those cities of gold and all that

01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:03.440
somebody say Doritos it was it's L do Rito so it's weird

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:10.600
el de wr ito it is it's do Mountain Dew and Doritos get it that's what they're

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:15.320
doing I got it you made a joke I got it all right you got that

01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:21.640
reference so basically this has been worked on since 2016 and two they're

01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:25.840
trying to take this game that was kind of partially made and bring it up to

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:30.760
like a full game and so now they have the 0.6 update which brings the game

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:36.200
even closer to halo 3 they've developed its upgraded graphics new maps they have

01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:42.200
their own Forge map editor it looks pretty awesome so they have actually

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:48.680
like a trailer you can check out and everything but yeah I mean it's pretty

01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:55.880
awesome looking size you doing chat says isn't a halo already online what dumb

01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:59.840
asses well I think this is supposed to be like a free-to-play game type of

01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:04.080
thing I think was it supposed to be more like MMO II to I don't say well it's MMO

01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:07.920
it was a battle royale yeah I think it was more along the lines of like they

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:11.680
have like a Call of Duty online that was like in China it's basically a free to

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:15.520
play game and they have like maps that appeared in the console versions of the

01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:18.720
game but you know there's all the free-to-play mechanics in there as well

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:24.000
like you know I guess loop well I say free-to-play mechanics nowadays but now

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.680
that I think of it it's actually more of just mechanics now that are in games you

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:34.520
know where you can purchase skins and stuff like that so far they have not

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:38.720
received the cease-or-desist or any further takedown actions yet they said

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:42.120
they're taking careful steps and distribution of 0.6 to make sure that

01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:49.880
doesn't happen yeah so interesting though that this is a thing that's been

01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:54.560
worked on but yeah it looks really polished is so far even yeah interesting

01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:59.000
how a modders are gonna finish that up when Microsoft wouldn't or bungee or

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.080
whoever was doing it at that time it was three four three games yeah oh yeah

01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:05.000
because this would have been after the transition right yeah okay it was

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:12.000
apparently this was announced I guess right around the time of halo 5 so kai's

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.960
judo and chat says they need to do a halo battle royale game be careful what

01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:23.640
you wish for because I you know Microsoft Microsoft wants people to buy

01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:27.400
Xbox ones and wants people to be jazzed about their exclusives everybody's

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:31.280
talking about God of War this week but Microsoft's like hey sea of thieves

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:36.400
hello they want people to remember they got exclusives too so I think a halo

01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:40.120
battle royale that's it's gonna happen battle royale like you know what like

01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:43.480
even they go back to Minecraft I remember one of the like more popular

01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.640
mods that was that round was the hunger game mods yeah so they were basically

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:51.360
just cribbing that but like it would be nice to have like an official game oh

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:54.400
that was like no maybe not call it hunger games you can call battle royale

01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:57.960
or something like that where is played very similarly where you you don't have

01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:00.640
to have like a mod or something to set it up you know that would be compatible

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:08.200
with the console versions would be nice all right let's talk about twitch

01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:13.120
because twitch got banned in an entire country this week that's not pleasant

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:17.480
news twitch got banned in Russia what okay well here's the thing it didn't

01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:21.880
actually get banned they got blocked and it was inadvertent and it's because

01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:26.800
Russia is kind of putting some smackdown on some IPs owned by Amazon and Google

01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:31.840
the reason why this all goes back to the messaging app telegram you guys ever use

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:35.800
telegram no I've used it for ingress related things it's basically just a

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:39.200
chat app okay it's a chat app but the thing about it is you can actually

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:43.520
encrypt your messages in telegram so you can send messages that are encrypted so

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:48.800
that way the government can't watch you okay and Russia and the security people

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:54.000
there don't like that because they want to be able to access data messages so

01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:59.040
Russia is trying to ban telegram telegram relies on Amazon and Google's

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:04.720
cloud services so the communications regulator in Russia has bulk banned a

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:08.760
significant number of IP addresses and IP gates that are owned by the companies

01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:14.240
so Amazon being that they own twitch basically twitch is getting caught in

01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:18.280
the crossfire of all this so it has nothing to do a twitch it's telegram a

01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:24.760
messaging app how about that so there you go so so far anyway it doesn't seem

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:27.720
like twitch can still be accessed in Russia and of course that has some

01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:35.600
people kind of irritated about it so anyway some folks are using VPN and tor

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.440
to get around it and actually write messages on the actual twitch website

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:43.800
and that was according to one I think broadcaster over on reddit that was

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:50.640
talking about how to get around that ban so there you go going to our chat

01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:55.880
over at live dot vog network comm some comments on telegram JD says furries use

01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:00.960
telegram heavily I did not know that Sia Tabiri says telegram has some great

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:06.400
emoji though that is true there is a very large sticker database of emoji

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:12.400
available in telegram so that's kind of neat let's see also over at chat live

01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:16.320
dot vog network comm s 200 Matt says everyone is getting VPNs over there then

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:21.120
yeah I think that's probably something's becoming more and more popular so

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:26.480
dungeon buster points out the great firewall of Russia hmm see the berry

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:32.160
says Putin's just upset he can't get more viewers than buzzer does he have a

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:35.840
twitch channel I don't know about that I know there are some Russian broadcasters

01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:41.120
would it be like Putin plays yeah Putin plays I don't know maybe maybe which are

01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:44.160
there any political leaders who you would watch if they had a twitch channel

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:49.280
maybe Justin Trudeau what I would watch Justin Trudeau play retro games

01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:56.440
absolutely probably not all right um let's move on Loki why don't we go to

01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:02.120
your next story all right so some well the Netherlands has deemed some loot

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:10.560
boxes that are in popular games are considered gambling so they did a study

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:15.240
looking into ten different games with loot boxes and declared that at least

01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:20.280
four of them were in violation of vetting and Gaming Act and then

01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:26.160
apparently I thought was a total six from what I saw the biggest reason for

01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:29.960
the decision they said that these four games allowed the the sale and trade of

01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:37.120
items externally through websites giving the items a market value six other games

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:40.800
that were studied which were not in violation of laws but we're still

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:49.560
heavily criticized for their addictive qualities they didn't state which games

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:56.080
were studied although with the speaking with the broadcast company nos they said

01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:03.520
that they brought a Dota 2 rocket League pub gene FIFA 18 as examples of loot

01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:09.280
boxes breaking the law and said offering these type of gameplay chances

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:16.000
to Dutch players without a license is prohibited so interesting and also

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.280
something to keep in mind is that the US is not the only country that's gonna

01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:22.320
have something to say on these loot box issues and certainly we've referenced

01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:25.680
many times that China kind of put out those odds laws where they had to

01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:28.800
publish the odds there it's going to be interesting as these other companies

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:31.880
weigh in on how they want loot boxes handled because many of these games are

01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:37.280
sold in many places besides just the US and you know Canada and stuff yeah so

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:42.360
that'll be interesting alright one story I want to talk to you guys about is

01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:47.880
about a game a fan game that's coming out called the 13th doll the 13th doll

01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:53.960
is going to be referencing old-school CD-ROM games like FMV full motion video

01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:59.320
type games it's actually a seventh guest fan game so the 13th doll is trying to

01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:03.840
recapture the I just say that very much for seventh gas yeah it is it's at the

01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:08.800
13th all a fan game of the seventh guest so anyway it is going to return to the

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:13.840
mansion of the toy maker Henry stuff and we'll follow tad the seventh guest from

01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:18.000
the previous journey and these left with scarred and racked with guilt from the

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.520
experience so he will be going back to the mansion to hopefully free the

01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:27.240
victims anyway there's a new doctor that gets in there as well 26 unique puzzles

01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:30.360
throughout the mansion and so on and so on they are looking to release this on

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:34.920
Halloween 2018 so I'm sure fans of the seventh guest will be excited about that

01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:38.880
so they are clearly saying it's a fan game they're not trying to make it

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:45.680
official cannon but that is kind of neat I'm surprised legally it's okay but maybe

01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:48.880
they got some type of permission for the original makers I doubt they're going

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:53.040
anywhere with it they still try to put out like seventh guest stuff on like I

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:56.520
know there's like a version on mobile phones and stuff yeah they've still been

01:51:56.520 --> 01:52:01.960
trying to milk that franchise all these years later it does not age well no it

01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:05.320
doesn't it really doesn't so it'd be interesting to see how a fan game kind

01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:09.160
of brings a lot of that in because now it'll all be in high definition I think

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:14.920
yes that is definitely in low definition nowadays yes yeah it doesn't those old

01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:20.280
CD-ROM games really didn't age well but they know what I'm sad that one CD-ROM

01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:24.920
game I have not seen brought the steam that I used to play the shit out of was

01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:31.520
mega race I'm surprised that they don't have a mega race game coming back I want

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:37.280
a mega race game yeah are there any um are there any 90s games that should be

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:40.760
coming back well mega race I want that uh-huh

01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:46.760
besides that sorry besides that CD I'm thinking CD based maybe I'm always

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:51.560
Sierra adventures but those are really FMV is he said phantasmagoria yeah that

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:54.840
of course is kind of alleged I thought that I can't that was already I've been

01:52:54.840 --> 01:53:02.800
released um I think so let's see Bobby Blackwell says sewer shark dungeon buster

01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:06.400
says ripper with more Christopher Walken how about Gabriel Knight with more Tim

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:11.160
Curry although that wasn't really an FMV game either was it oh he just voiced a

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:15.920
character in that game how about the old making the video stuff from Sega CD oh

01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:21.720
god the crisscross and you know what music factory I have the marky mark one

01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:26.840
and the crisscross one you need to eat the CNC music factory one wasn't there a

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:31.040
CNC one I think there was another one that was like the last one yeah someone

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:34.600
wants to send me the CNC one so my collection will be complete whoopty shit

01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:38.920
but you know yeah all right anyway before we get to your calls at orange

01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:42.600
lounge radio all one word on Skype we've got one more story for you guys tonight

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:47.680
drama and it has to do with the never-ending soap opera of 80s video

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:52.080
game playing I should find the you know you need to find me I need the intro to

01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:57.160
like sands and the hourglass so are the days of our lives

01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:01.960
see I could do that you can let me see how about uh something like that

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:07.520
hopefully there's no see but they always buy this by the ads of our by this thing

01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:12.000
all right hold on let's let's get to it

01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:20.480
like sands through the hourglass so are the days of our lives so are the drama

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:26.960
of our twin galaxies oh gosh see a Billy Mitchell is fighting back against twin

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:32.840
galaxies yeah they removed all of his stuff and he's like well fuck you but

01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:39.920
probably nicer you know with some hot sauce added to it he is taking experts

01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:45.680
under to his home to show them his Donkey Kong loading screens so they can

01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:49.400
see that they are the real arcade loading screens and not emulator he's

01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:56.120
inviting strangers into his home to inspect his Donkey Kong girl and he also

01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:03.240
wants to find witnesses for his high score the one million sixty two thousand

01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:08.160
eight hundred points that was at the boomers in Diana Beach so or sorry

01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:14.560
Dania Beach so um good luck I mean if he can do it that's great I don't see how

01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:18.440
showing them what his system looks like now because they can compare loading

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:23.640
screens with the ones he sent in I get that but like it's been several years he

01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:27.560
could have replaced the hardware in that cabinet since then I mean that's by no

01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:32.600
means a definitive oh well he didn't cheat I guess this video is just lying

01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:38.720
to us Elmore chart in our chat room says Billy Mitchell will win through the

01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:43.520
sheer power of luxurious hair let's not fool ourselves it's a weave it is a it

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:49.800
is a Billy Mitchell's a little bit older that ain't his real hair it could be I

01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:59.640
don't think it is it's just emulated let's see JD in our chat over at live

01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:03.900
dog hugged over dot-com says I've had strangers inspect my Dixie Diddy funky

01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:12.780
and lanky that reminds me I've had a strangers inspect my inky and binky and

01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:19.760
pinky and sue we've been binging the oh that one nevermind fuck off I'm sorry

01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:25.280
look I said that reminds me we've been binging the match game lately it's good

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:30.960
yes the best scene they had in there was like they were talking about like

01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:35.560
something about like food or something I don't remember like how they would get

01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:42.440
how they would you know attract ladies to the ladies night thing in a bar or

01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:45.680
something like that and for summary of singles night how they would track

01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:49.720
ladies at singles night and for some reason the dude that was answering the

01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:54.560
question and I don't know why thought he said seagulls night and so he's like

01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:58.920
fish they just like they lost it it was just hilarious

01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:11.840
lounge radio all one word on Skype I love this oh my god this parody is so

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:15.160
like high concept I love it do you understand this reference here in our

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:20.560
chat see it to bury in chat says my name is dark Sakura my journey is

01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:24.980
continuing a journey that I hope will open the doors of life to me and link my

01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:29.680
past with my future a journey that will bring me to a strange and dark place to

01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:34.720
the edge of the sea high atop n7 studios a house called Robin Allen's place a

01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:39.120
world I've never known with people I've never met people who tonight are still

01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:46.120
only shadows in my mind but who will soon fill the days and nights of my do

01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:51.000
you get the reference I know I've heard it before opening to dark shadows right

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:56.400
right right aim is Victoria Winters yes did I mean you know what dark shadows I

01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:01.120
never saw I never did see the Burton movie that he did a couple years ago did

01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:04.760
did they start it off the same way with that I didn't see it actually I watched

01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:11.640
the redo but mom was telling me she mom was totally into the the redo because

01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:16.080
she watched dark shadows as a kid I yeah I love the dark shadows 90 reboot that's

01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:20.200
like the only one I've seen start to finish and boy is it a cliffhanger

01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:24.860
finish like that was some bullshit but the the dark shadows remake on in the

01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:28.760
90s again if you want to take us back to games orange launch radio all one word

01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:33.920
on Skype the dark shadows reboot in the 90s that aired like while the Gulf War

01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:37.520
started you remember that and that was all happening nice so it wasn't really

01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:40.280
able to find its audience because it kept getting bumped and moved around and

01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:44.000
stuff because of ongoing Gulf War coverage so that show kind of got

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:54.640
screwed did you know that I think it was the CW or was it before they they merged

01:58:54.640 --> 01:59:01.200
into the new net wait wait it what was it called wb the WB so I think the WB

01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:05.360
back when it was that wanted to do a dark shadows reboot and they made a

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:09.220
pilot and everything but they didn't pick it up to series but you know like

01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:13.100
the bread and butter of CW is a lot of those like the Vampire Diaries no like

01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:16.920
the DC comic show yes now that yeah there's tons of that so good they took

01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:20.420
Supergirl they've got arrow I mean the all that stuff I would think dark

01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:23.680
shadows would fit in really well with that type of lineup so I'm just I'm

01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:30.000
really surprised they didn't end up making a show about a QPN no UPN well I

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:36.660
mean that was I mean UPN and WB merged and became CW except UPN had like no

01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:40.680
shows left by the time they said they had they got top model for a few years

01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:45.760
and what else from UPN like everything that was good on UPN went away like

01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:50.040
Buffy moved to UPN for the last few seasons right and then of course Voyager

01:59:50.040 --> 01:59:54.960
but those shows were done before that merger happened so I don't know anyway

01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:59.040
see a Tiberian chat says the Burton movie is interesting but it's basically

01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:04.600
a loving parody hmm anyway act F wants to know is the Skype line open yes

02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:09.080
Orange Lounge radio all one word Bobby wasn't getting any calls either so could

02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:15.040
it be Skype is no cuz he was able to call us it's weird anyway Kossett in

02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:21.980
chat says was Voyager and deep space 9 on UPN not DC's 9 deep space 9 and next

02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:27.840
generation were in syndication so a lot of your TV networks that became UPN kind

02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:33.080
of picked that stuff up cuz I know here those are all on Fox 40 back in the day

02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:36.560
but they were like Saturdays in the afternoon was when those those shows

02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:42.300
aired like back-to-back but but that was before Fox had football when they really

02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:49.500
took off as a network so it was the early years I guess Elmo chart in our

02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:54.760
chat says I was a bit a bit of a goth in the 90s my mom was like let me tell you

02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:58.160
about this thing I watch called dark shadows and my little mind was blown

02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:02.400
yeah I mean dark I mean even the original soap opera was really kind of

02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:07.640
rad for its time you know it was made in what the 70s right did it start in the

02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:11.040
late 60s or did it start in the mid 70s I want to think it was the 60s but I'll

02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:14.920
find out give me a sec yeah so and then you know it's about its dark shadows is

02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:19.400
basically vampires and magic and all this stuff but like in a soap opera I

02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:26.800
don't think anything ever really matched it until my 1960s 1966 through 1971 okay

02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:31.360
my fave soap opera ever and yes I watched the soap opera for quite some

02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:36.360
time this soap opera was fucking amazing do you know what it is star Sakura you

02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:44.760
got to know what it is it was on NBC the late 90s really over the top holy crap

02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:51.400
because that was when mom was still it had Haley Mills sister in it fuck

02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:59.560
passions oh yeah that show was so fucking great because it was just like

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:05.280
it was straight-up badly it was parody it was so bad it was good it was so good

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:09.640
good job chatters kaijuto casa and see it to bury all light up there with

02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:14.480
passions yes with Tabitha and Timmy I distinctly remember an episode where

02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:22.840
Tabitha tied somebody to the train tracks and that was the drama that show

02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:26.200
is so fucking good I wish they bring it back they need to make a movie out of

02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:29.880
passions that's what I need to do anyway we got a call let's go to it hi you're

02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:32.920
on orange lounge radio who's this

02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:40.040
hello it's orange lounge radio and you are you might be muted good caller now

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:48.600
would be the time to unmute yourself I feel like I hear chatting I hear typing

02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:56.520
but the person isn't talking okay sorry hi is this act F'd yeah it's

02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:02.480
exact F'd surprise how are you don't know what happened there but anyways

02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:05.440
that's all right you had an out-of-body experience for a moment what's on your

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:11.360
mind buddy yeah anyways I could talk to us about so many stuff that you probably

02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:16.720
talked to tonight but I was so distracted with another thing I want to

02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:22.360
talk about Pokemon go we touched on Pokemon go but what's what's your

02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:26.160
experience what do you want to talk about with it especially about the

02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:32.880
missions they have right now with with with the mythical missions and also the

02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:39.000
field research mission I'm still working on that goddamn meal I got the stupid

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:46.640
ditto I evolved the Magikarp thanks to the the Kanto event we just had I was

02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:51.560
able to get enough Magikarp candy that wasn't so hard now I am stuck on the 10

02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:58.320
raids and that's actually pretty easy to do you can't cheese it anymore you can't

02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:04.000
no you have because now it doesn't it counts the raid when you feed your raid

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.640
pass it doesn't count the raid when you fail the raid over and over and over

02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:14.400
again I didn't know that yeah so I actually have to do 10 raids so which is

02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:18.560
fine I bought one of the boxes that had like 16 raid passes in it but it's like

02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:22.160
I'm not gonna go out of my way to do raids I don't want to do just to get

02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:26.820
this stupid achievement does that make sense oh yeah that at least that's like

02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:33.260
the easy part in that in those missions because yeah the Magikarp one was

02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:39.020
probably the hardest one finding the ditto was the hardest for me yeah without

02:04:39.020 --> 02:04:43.300
counting the ditto one though oh although for me it was kinda easy

02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:49.460
because I did it pretty much instantly yeah obviously it was luck but still

02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:53.700
I'm not in a rush for Mew because real chat even though Mew is an awesome

02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:57.060
Pokemon and has a good story behind it and the fact that you know especially

02:04:57.060 --> 02:05:01.260
with the first movie and everything and its status is a mythical Pokemon it's

02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:05.900
actually not a good Pokemon in the game like it's not a very powerful Pokemon

02:05:05.900 --> 02:05:08.940
it's not one you're gonna use I don't even think you can put it in gyms or

02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:15.180
anything so I'm not really in a rush until they say like Celebi's coming or

02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:20.100
Mew is end dated or something like that then I will rush to finish it but right

02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:25.660
now I'm just kind of taking my sweet ass time yeah I also took my time with it

02:05:25.660 --> 02:05:31.340
although I already had it but it's the what I want to talk about about the

02:05:31.340 --> 02:05:37.100
missions especially it's the the fact that it brings a lot of new life to the

02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:43.900
game I didn't stop playing Pokemon go any time since it launched back in 2016

02:05:43.900 --> 02:05:49.660
so right now I'm still playing it every day but trying to do the missions it's

02:05:49.660 --> 02:05:55.340
like a new incentive to play it's something that it needed the the game

02:05:55.340 --> 02:06:01.120
needed a long time ago oh yeah no it's definitely put more into the game

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:04.700
breathe more life in it like I really try to get those daily stamps done

02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:09.180
although man sometimes those quests you get are ridiculous like oh yeah spin

02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:12.780
three pokey stops you haven't spun before like I get I get what they're

02:06:12.780 --> 02:06:17.700
doing with that but like I've I've hit a lot of because of Ingress and stuff I've

02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:21.420
hit a lot of pokey stops in this town like there's very little I haven't done

02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:28.140
unless I actually just got a new portal accepted in OPR in Ingress like three

02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:35.280
days ago and it is now a pokey stop at a park not far from my work so that I was

02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:38.540
able to spin that as a new pokey stop great I got to do that three times so

02:06:38.540 --> 02:06:42.420
like that's hard to do and then I hate the one that's a three Oddish or Bell

02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:46.060
Sprout because I never see those things anyway I mean the Kanto event was one

02:06:46.060 --> 02:06:50.180
thing they were everywhere the Oddish I had one that was three like Trico's or

02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:56.180
like something else it was like that one tree oh and market so with those like I

02:06:56.180 --> 02:07:00.860
just throw them away and go to another pokey stop but you know it's like the

02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:04.660
battle in a raid or throw two nice throws in a row or what I have one right

02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:09.160
now I have two I have two instances of catch three insects so I'm earning them

02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:13.420
both at the same time okay there you go yeah

02:07:13.420 --> 02:07:19.140
seriously I also have that one too that the bug one and I also have one to hatch

02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:25.620
three eggs and I already hatched one so that's gonna be eventually done but yeah

02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:29.660
that's the good thing about the the field missions that you can just throw

02:07:29.660 --> 02:07:33.340
them away if you don't want to do them or can't do them because there's also

02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:40.660
one I have gotten to that's catch one dragon and well like really really

02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:47.020
Niantic if you can you can do that if you're gonna do a latios raid because

02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:53.060
that is a dragon yeah yeah but still it's like since I don't have too much

02:07:53.060 --> 02:07:58.700
time to play during the day because of work I barely can do any rates like in

02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:04.380
at least in the weekdays only on weekend so I prefer to yes throw them away and

02:08:04.380 --> 02:08:07.820
and do another mission yeah that's fair yeah I've been really like I'll just

02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:11.420
throw it away to get something I know I can do because I I have gotten my stamp

02:08:11.420 --> 02:08:15.060
every single day since the start of this and every single moltres that's come

02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:20.780
with it my assumption is they'll rotate it out next month I have a feeling it is

02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:24.380
on a monthly rotation because didn't this whole thing start though this whole

02:08:24.380 --> 02:08:27.860
thing started right at the end of March right like wasn't like the first week

02:08:27.860 --> 02:08:32.300
March 28 March 29 so here's the thing I bet the way they did it I bet Articuno

02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:37.900
was March's reward but because you couldn't finish it in March it went

02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:41.140
right into the next reward which is moltres because this is the same order

02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:44.900
the legendaries rolled out in the game with the exception of Lugea but they

02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:49.060
just brought Lugea back to raids not that long ago so I bet next month this

02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:53.500
might be get guests we're gonna get Zapdos next month they'll realize the

02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:57.340
fuck up they made and then do Articuno at that point again and then it'll move

02:08:57.340 --> 02:09:01.940
into the Lions and this is how people in areas where they complain they can't

02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:05.220
raid all the time this is how they're gonna get their legendaries because they

02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:09.340
did make it the raid legendaries are still better especially if you can get

02:09:09.340 --> 02:09:13.500
weather boosted because you're gonna get either a level 20 or if you can do a

02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:17.860
weather booster to 25 from a raid the ones you get from these catch sequences

02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:22.740
are only level 15 but it's better to have a level 15 Pokemon than none at all

02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:29.540
oh definitely yeah and I'm waiting for Zapdos because it's the only one of the

02:09:29.540 --> 02:09:35.300
birds yes the only one I don't have so I really want to complete my pokey decks

02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:41.060
at least without the regionals so yeah it's I'm really waiting for that and

02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:46.300
also I've been doing my missions every day and I have that in yeah also every

02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:50.940
single moltres even though they don't they kind of suck with IVs and all that

02:09:50.940 --> 02:09:55.620
stuff but yeah I really don't care that much but let's still yeah it's more

02:09:55.620 --> 02:09:58.900
about the pokey decks than it is necessarily having the strongest Pokemon

02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:03.020
I'm totally with you like I would love to see them put the regionals like I

02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:06.780
would love to see you know as they're expanding into gen 3 for you know at

02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:10.140
some point they're gonna put more region lock stuff in those gens so you know

02:10:10.140 --> 02:10:14.820
what it's time to go back to gen 1 and do some quest rewards that give us mr.

02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:18.600
mime and Kangaskhan and the things we don't have yet you know let the other

02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:21.900
countries get taro's and so forth it would be that would be great I'd love

02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:27.860
that yeah me too don't know if you have heard about the earth date thing they

02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:32.120
did oh yeah I heard that was that was happening did did the results come in

02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:37.300
for that I don't know actually I was gonna ask you if you know if you knew

02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:42.860
anything about it because it was rumored that if the goal was reached we could

02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:48.700
have maybe got get Kangaskhan or maybe mr. mime for for unlock oh like maybe

02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:52.860
that's gonna be the incentive or whatever is doing the earth day stuff I

02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:56.420
don't know I'm checking the still road read it and I haven't seen anything

02:10:56.420 --> 02:11:00.020
about it yet so I imagine they'll make they'll make it now so we earth day

02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:03.740
progress is there any way to track the progress of the earth day goals haven't

02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:07.780
heard anything on their website every single event is full so realistically

02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:11.600
they have to unlock the top set of rewards within 48 of hours of the event

02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:16.740
ending so some places didn't have anything organized when the trainers got

02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:24.580
there oh so who knows we'll see I guess we'll find out maybe tomorrow when the

02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:31.140
workday starts Niantic will put out a tweet now hopefully yeah all right

02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:33.740
awesome well if there's nothing else act-deaf I think I'll go ahead and let

02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:38.860
you go anything else you want to talk about no that was it all right sounds

02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:42.460
good buddy I'm gonna let you go have a good day okay you too all right bye

02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:46.660
orange launch radio all one word on Skype if you want to get in anybody else

02:11:46.660 --> 02:11:50.180
with last-minute stories or anything they want to talk about I'm having the

02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:59.260
worst time in the universe finding a Tron shirt a Tron shirt yep is there a

02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:03.500
way you could get one from Shanghai Disney because they have the Tron ride

02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:06.940
there so I imagine they've got merch to go with it I'm looking for something to

02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:13.060
Disney bound and I found the Hurley dress I'm being resold but it's not Tron

02:12:13.060 --> 02:12:18.900
enough yeah so I bet I was thinking I mean the whole reason this comes up is

02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:23.220
because I have been on a Tron kick kind of to the point where I'm thinking about

02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:30.460
playing Tron evolution again why not the Tron 360 game is or the 360 Tron is a

02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:36.340
playable on Xbox one and don't have one well but they had it on ps3 and was it

02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:42.100
on computer I think it was on PC at some point I don't know all right let's see

02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:45.780

you know I managed to get my hands on the smartphone no thanks to well thick

02:13:24.180 --> 02:13:31.300

02:13:31.300 --> 02:13:37.100
of those Android Samsung phones I forget the near the particular model but that

02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:43.380

02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:51.660
music surf the internet yada yada yada okay no oh no what is the question you

02:13:51.660 --> 02:14:00.220
want to ask us say not talk tight here sorry what games outside of that Pokemon

02:14:00.220 --> 02:14:08.140
you know go game can you recommend no for a small throne is concerned it's

02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:13.020
Android beast ingress and go on the green team but you will have to go

02:14:13.020 --> 02:14:17.340
outside a lot for that game but that was designed for older phones other like

02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:21.780
serious answers for rage I am kind of serious that answer though but other

02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:27.700
suggestions for raging air for like what about your clicker games don't you love

02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:32.180
your clicker games I played the office space one but it's just it's so blatant

02:14:32.180 --> 02:14:35.700
with they're trying to get you to spend money type stuff I don't really know

02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:40.460
like I used to play the card of Mario one a good suggestion from our chat over

02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:44.740
at live dog network calm act F suggests Super Mario run which is free to try

02:14:44.740 --> 02:14:48.500
super hexagon I think that's a very good suggestion I think you have to pay for

02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:53.580
that one but it's like not even a dollar I think for that one let's see as far as

02:14:53.580 --> 02:14:58.260
the mobile phone games go I know like there's a lot of ports of especially

02:14:58.260 --> 02:15:01.460
like Square Enix stuff a lot of the old Final Fantasy games are available which

02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:08.100
I think is pretty cool if you like music based games what like re raves plus is

02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:16.900
available so is why is the name escape me in the moment the the other god damn

02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:21.940
it the other neon FM that's the one try anything on neon FM you can get puzzle

02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:24.740
fighter why you still can even though they're taking that offline pretty soon

02:15:24.740 --> 02:15:31.660
I know a very popular one is bejeweled in the various jeweled blitz and stuff

02:15:31.660 --> 02:15:34.700
that they have there I don't know if this is on Android but if it is you

02:15:34.700 --> 02:15:37.980
should get trap adventure that's one of those games that will drive you fucking

02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:41.540
crazy let's see going to chat over at live dot

02:15:41.540 --> 02:15:46.060
fog network calm JD suggest there's a whole bunch of p-cross games Oh act F

02:15:46.060 --> 02:15:49.660
suggests hearthstone that's a really good suggestion to you like magic the

02:15:49.660 --> 02:15:53.980
gathering I think I think the best suggestion so far is hearthstone

02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:57.980
pop culture says injustice to that on mobile I guess it is on mobile phones

02:15:57.980 --> 02:16:02.300
isn't I do remember seeing something about that and pop culture says there is

02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:07.260
a vogue league on injustice to that's pretty cool JD suggest Pokemon shuffle

02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:13.220
which is a match three type of game so lots of suggestions anything else here

02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:21.460

later than others because I know some what was in 2001 no but where there's a

02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:21.500
picture of an actor somewhere that somebody took where the actor was still

02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:25.020
using a flip phone was it Daniel Day-Lewis always it was somebody got a

02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:27.980
picture like Daniel Day-Lewis on the subway and he was still using a flip

02:17:27.980 --> 02:17:31.220
phone and that was like that that's why the tweet went viral because like oh my

02:17:31.220 --> 02:17:37.700

02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:42.340

your computer you're on out of here one foot out the door what's your final

02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:03.300
thought tonight my final thought is hopefully I'm awake enough this week to

02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:07.020
actually play some games cuz I've been just like brain dead I haven't able to

02:19:07.020 --> 02:19:12.000
do anything and so it's like I'd rather just go to sleep my final thought is I

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:15.460
was gonna do a I was think I was having a hard time figuring out what to do for

02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:19.020
a post-show stream tonight I was like oh maybe I'll do retro games I'll get my
