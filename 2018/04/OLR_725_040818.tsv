14000	20000	This week, amidst the upper-overport pixel smoothing, Square Enix announces that graphic style will soon become a choice for Chrono Trigger.
20000	27000	This is just one story in a night full of news. Welcome back to a regularly scheduled and live episode of the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	39000	We are live once again, and welcome back to another episode of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight.
39000	49000	Episode number 725 for this, April the 8th of 2018. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter as Skie, S-K-I-E.
49000	54000	And I'm joined, as always, to talk about video games with the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
54000	56000	Mr. Smush made the best noise.
57000	64000	Mr. Smush is the resident cat, by the way, if you didn't know. He's my son. He's my three-year-old baby.
64000	70000	He makes little noises like a piggy because he has the smush face. That's actually not why he's called Mr. Smush, it helps.
70000	80000	But I called him Mr. Smush because, okay, Sanrio, our old cat who passed, when you would like pet her and she really loved you, she would lick. She'd lick, lick, lick. She'd lick your fingers.
80000	85000	Mr. Smush, what he does, if he loves you and you put your hand out, he'll just ram his whole face into your hand.
85000	86000	He also does that, too.
86000	89000	Yeah, so I was like, oh, he's a smushing kitty, so I called him Mr. Smush.
89000	92000	You know, every cat, though, that my friends have, I give a nickname, too.
92000	93000	Do you?
93000	94000	He's Smushy.
94000	96000	Smushy? It's derivative.
96000	101000	My friend Susan's cat, Pantera, not after the band, but because it means panther.
101000	103000	Okay, I still like Pantera after the band.
103000	106000	Her nickname is Miss Pants.
106000	107000	Okay.
107000	109000	Sanrio, I called Sanchan, or old lady.
109000	111000	Old lady. That was a good one.
111000	120000	But anyway, I want to say what was hilarious about it is right when this show music starts, Mr. Smush comes in here and plops up on the guest, which is usually our guest chair, this very old chair I've had in my family for a long time.
120000	124000	He plops up on the chair. All he needs is a microphone. I guess we could give him one.
124000	125000	Should I give Mr. Smush a microphone?
125000	127000	I was just thinking it was his regal throne.
127000	131000	Would you all be bothered by random cat noises if I give Mr. Smush a microphone?
131000	132000	Here we go.
132000	133000	I wouldn't be.
133000	135000	Mr. Smush, if you have anything to say, you just say it right into that microphone.
135000	137000	Unless he pulls, you know, cat assholeness and knocks it down.
137000	140000	Yeah, he's going to knock it down. When do you guys hear that big thud later on?
140000	141000	That's Mr. Smush.
141000	142000	That's Mr. Smush peacing out.
142000	143000	That's his opinion.
143000	144000	All right.
144000	147000	Hey, speaking of opinions, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
147000	148000	Hello.
148000	149000	How are you? How are you?
149000	151000	I'm good. I'm having spicy salsa.
151000	152000	I'm sorry.
152000	153000	So my tongue's on fire.
153000	154000	What do you need to drink?
154000	156000	But it's so much better than the Pico, so.
156000	157000	All right, you need to drink.
157000	159000	Better to have your tongue on fire than your ass on fire.
159000	161000	This is true.
161000	163000	I felt like you were trying to get a thought out there.
163000	164000	Oh, hey.
164000	165000	I hopped over to Loki.
165000	170000	Random observation. I noticed that you have taken your arcade cabinets out of the Roxas.
170000	171000	Okay, yes. Let's talk about that.
171000	182000	So my little arcade cabinet collection, which really is Jamie's, like, helped me build this significantly because she found these little, they're called arcade minis and they're available, but they're only available.
182000	183000	Playing Dan.
183000	186000	They're only available at Wal-Mart and I think Amazon.
186000	187000	Wal-Mart.
187000	191000	But Jamie saw them all at Wal-Mart, so she texted me like, do you want them? I'm like, heck yeah.
191000	194000	So she got me five of these seven machines that are up here.
194000	203000	And so I have these tiny little mini arcade cabinets with Pac-Man, Centipede, Rampage, Joust, Qbert, Frogger and Asteroids.
203000	205000	So there's a story behind this, though.
205000	206000	Yeah, go for it.
206000	210000	Dan took me to four different Wal-Marts looking for these fuckers.
210000	213000	I was like, I don't want to go to Wal-Mart. I don't want to go to Wal-Mart.
213000	220000	So as I'm driving home, there's a Wal-Mart that Dan hasn't been to because he doesn't really have a reason to, so I just stopped randomly.
220000	224000	Because you can buy fabric and I was looking at the crafty stuff, but they had them.
224000	229000	So that's when I texted you and I told Dan that they had them, so I bought the first two of the LCD screens.
229000	231000	I didn't get the crappy screens.
231000	235000	Which I want to say was Qbert and Centipede.
235000	237000	Yeah, I think those were the first two you got me, yeah.
237000	239000	Which is funny because we've kind of been on a Qbert kick.
239000	240000	Yeah.
240000	241000	And then...
241000	244000	And honestly, of those machines, here's the thing.
244000	248000	Even though they're all in the same collection or whatever, like there's...
248000	249000	They're all emulated.
249000	255000	Well, sort of. See, here's the thing. The early, early Pac-Man and Space Invaders were the first two in the collection.
255000	257000	They're not that great. They're basically game and watches.
257000	258000	Yeah.
258000	260000	Meaning they have the burned-in, you know...
260000	261000	LED.
261000	262000	Yeah, LED thing. Or LCD.
262000	263000	LCD.
263000	267000	LCD. Where it's already like burned in and stuff. So it's like Mr. Game and Watch.
267000	268000	Yeah.
268000	270000	Okay, that's what it looks like. And they're not very good.
270000	274000	And then the new Pac-Man and Asteroids, kind of the same thing.
274000	276000	Just a color version of them.
276000	278000	Just a color version of Pac-Man. So they're also not very good.
278000	281000	But the other ones... I only got those for completion's sake.
281000	289000	The other ones like Joust and Qbert and Rampage, they all use like little emulated like either like ColecoVision or Atari. I don't know what versions.
289000	296000	The version of Qbert actually, if I am correct, it is a modified version of the ColecoVision version.
296000	301000	I want to see if the noise will actually come through on the mic. I don't know how well this will be.
306000	307000	Barely.
307000	309000	It's loading, loading, loading.
311000	314000	It doesn't really have the music, which is the crappy part.
316000	317000	Yeah.
317000	323000	That was him cursing because I got hit. Anyway, there you go. A little taste of Qbert. Sorry, I thought that had music in it. I guess not.
323000	325000	So it must be an old version.
325000	329000	Yeah, if I remember... Well, I mean, believe it or not, I still have my ColecoVision.
329000	333000	And we've played Qbert on it a couple of times. And it has like a little bit of the...
334000	338000	You know, so it does have a little bit of music, but that's why I think that this one's a modified version.
338000	341000	Because Qbert actually looks right. He doesn't have the vacant eyes.
341000	347000	Right. And Dr. Suya says, I want to see Qbert as Konami's NES version. No, the NES version had that little introduction at the level.
347000	352000	I did not care for the... And actually, if you want to see a really good comparison, though, for versions of Qbert.
352000	358000	One of my favorite channels is... I think it's like Retro Wave, but he does Battle of the Ports.
358000	362000	And he did every home release and arcade release of Qbert.
362000	367000	Side by side. And it's a really good comparison. I really enjoyed this guy's commentary.
367000	371000	SHJ100Matt says, I saw these things and was considering getting one.
371000	374000	Honestly, they're not bad. I mean, they're kind of hard to play.
374000	377000	I think if I was like younger, if I was a younger kid, I would be super...
377000	380000	Like your kids, Loki, I would think would be super into this.
380000	382000	Because the little joystick for the little hands.
382000	383000	Like anything like that.
383000	385000	Yeah. But for me, they're really hard to play.
385000	390000	And I don't think the Pac-Man and Asteroids are very good, like I said a minute ago.
390000	394000	But the others are... I mean, because they are like little tiny displays.
394000	396000	Little mini, mini color TVs. They work good.
396000	399000	Well, I did hook up the arcade cabinet again this week.
399000	405000	Because I moved it to the other side of the garage, plugged it in, and hooked the computer back up to it.
405000	407000	Problem is, I get no display on it now.
407000	410000	Which I'm not surprised, because the way they built it...
410000	419000	Basically, since it is an arcade machine, normally you have the boards screwed down to an actual piece of wood that slides in and out of the cabinet.
419000	421000	So it's easy to kind of put it in there.
422000	427000	But the graphics card that I have is just kind of... There's nothing really holding it into the board.
427000	429000	It just kind of wobbles around in there.
429000	433000	So I did try to brace it up with some brackets, but it never was in there very well.
433000	436000	And I think something broke there.
436000	439000	And it's a really old graphics card too that may have broken.
439000	444000	So I have to test it on another monitor first to make sure it's actually working.
445000	450000	And it may just be simply replacing the graphics card, which I have dozens of them in my garage.
450000	452000	That won't be a problem.
452000	455000	And I can actually replace it with a better graphics card.
457000	460000	I was hoping I wouldn't have to do that, because everything was already set up and nice.
460000	462000	It's just, you know, whatever.
462000	465000	Anyway, I'm looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
465000	470000	Ragenator says, if I recall correctly, the first arcade game that I ever played was Popeye.
470000	472000	That's a great throwback game.
472000	474000	People forget about Popeye, I think, from the 80s.
474000	477000	Nintendo did the arcade cabs for that too, if I remember right.
477000	478000	I had the Coleco version.
478000	482000	Yeah, that was a great little 80s platformer that kind of disappeared with time.
482000	484000	Probably because of the license.
484000	488000	With contemporaries though, I still preferred Kangaroo over Popeye.
488000	492000	I was still a Popeye fan, but that's because of my Commodore 64 connection,
492000	495000	because that's one of the earliest things I remember playing on Commodore 64 was Popeye.
495000	498000	It was a Parker Brothers C64 cartridge.
498000	500000	They had a very unique shape.
500000	503000	My first arcade game I want to say was Pac-Man,
503000	509000	because I have a vague memory of being three and being held up by my mom's boyfriend to play it.
509000	512000	I want to say I have these two conflicting memories.
512000	514000	I'm not sure which one was first.
514000	515000	My mic wasn't on, I think.
515000	516000	No, you were fine.
516000	517000	Okay.
517000	519000	It was either Tempest at a young age.
519000	523000	I remember playing Tempest at a very young age with the little dial that spins.
523000	526000	And then also another unique controller.
526000	530000	I have a distinct remember of being at a Chuck E. Cheese in the 80s when my sister got married.
530000	533000	I would have been like four or five years old, and I remember playing Crystal Castles.
533000	536000	So I remember that being one of the earliest games that I played in the arcade.
536000	540000	Actually, I like that we're bringing up old arcade games.
540000	542000	And by the way, a proper shout out to our chat room,
542000	547000	because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of the Geeks network of vogganetwork.com,
547000	550000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
550000	555000	And let me just say, it is great to be back tonight after essentially three weeks,
555000	558000	because we were gone two weeks ago because I was out at Bobby Black Wolf's wedding.
558000	561000	And then last week was Easter, which I hope you guys had a great day off.
561000	562000	We got a little sunburned.
562000	563000	Yeah, I heard.
563000	565000	But we raised a lot of money for a charity.
565000	566000	Congrats.
566000	568000	And I got to meet all kinds of sisters.
568000	569000	Good.
569000	571000	Including one of my inspirations, Sister Berenze.
571000	573000	Oh, I know Sister Berenze.
573000	574000	You met Roma, right?
574000	575000	Oh, yeah.
575000	578000	I love Sister Roma because of the Facebook campaign.
578000	580000	I thanked her for that one.
580000	584000	Sister Roma is actually the first sister I ever met in 2006 at the Castro Street Fair.
584000	586000	And for those that don't know, just a quick background.
586000	589000	Jamie's part of this organization, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.
589000	593000	Honestly, the easiest way I could explain it to the broad audience that listens to this show.
593000	594000	What's that?
594000	595000	Drag nun.
595000	599000	Yeah, basically, if you've ever seen dudes dressed as nuns, although not only dudes, right, Narsara?
599000	602000	If you've seen dudes dressed as nuns, it was probably them.
602000	603000	Yeah, been around since the 70s.
603000	604000	So, cool.
604000	609000	And Sister Roma is one of the most famous because of the Facebook campaign where, you know,
609000	612000	you should not have to use your real name.
612000	615000	Which I don't use my real name on Facebook and I shouldn't have to.
615000	621000	But if you go look on the World of Wonder YouTube channel, you can find Sister Roma
621000	624000	and Sister Berenze doing besties for cash.
624000	628000	How else will they be able to get accurate information for all their analytics that they're
628000	629000	leaking to the world?
629000	630000	I know, right?
630000	632000	Right about now, I'm real happy I used a fake name.
632000	633000	Thanks.
633000	634000	But anyway, not to distract.
634000	637000	What were you going to mention before the Easter thing?
637000	640000	Do you remember?
640000	641000	I guess not.
641000	645000	And it was something that would have been important, but I forgot.
645000	648000	Let me quickly read a couple more memories from our chat room.
648000	650000	Let's see.
650000	653000	Ragenator says, I never played the NES version.
653000	658000	It wasn't until I had a PS3 when I finally played a home version of Qbert.
658000	659000	Oh, sorry.
659000	662000	Dartesuja says, I vaguely remember my first arcade game.
662000	665000	I remember going to Bullwinkles and that was still a thing.
665000	667000	I love Bullwinkles.
667000	670000	Like, I remember a Noah's Ark game randomly, though.
670000	671000	There was a Noah's Ark game.
671000	673000	I remember the mineshaft here had it locally.
673000	675000	That place was awesome when it was...
675000	676000	I love Bullwinkles.
676000	677000	Probably better than Chuck E. Cheese.
677000	678000	I don't think I ever went to Bullwinkles.
678000	680000	We never had one where I lived.
680000	681000	Bullwinkles is a Bay Area thing, right?
681000	682000	He was.
682000	683000	Yeah.
683000	686000	But I did remember, and this is, and to this day I still suck at Frogger if I'm not wearing
686000	692000	roller skates, but I would go to the Babalu in Dothan, Alabama when I was there to visit
692000	694000	my daddy and my granny.
694000	698000	And the Babalu was owned by a man named Bob and his wife, Lou.
698000	703000	But Bob taught skating with my granddaddy, so he knew who I was and would always play
703000	705000	the songs I'd ask.
705000	711000	But I would play a ton of Frogger and early pinball on roller skates.
711000	715000	It was the only way I could play certain things is on roller skates to this day.
715000	716000	So, just saying.
716000	717000	Good time.
717000	719000	I remember playing Spy Hunter on roller skates.
719000	720000	Anyway.
720000	723000	Well, since we're talking about old games, that actually leads into a little bit of the
723000	724000	kickoff topic I want to talk about tonight.
724000	727000	I do want to give a shout out, though, to PAX East.
727000	731000	I was hoping to maybe get somebody on the show who'd been to PAX East this weekend,
731000	733000	but my Twitter calls went unanswered.
733000	737000	But to be fair, I didn't think of it until the last minute, and a lot of people are probably
737000	739000	traveling back from PAX East right now.
739000	742000	But if you didn't go to PAX East, I hope you had a great time.
742000	745000	I haven't been in, what was the last time I went?
745000	746000	2014, I think?
746000	748000	My years start to blur together.
748000	751000	Whatever year the snowmageddon was, like, two weeks before PAX East.
751000	752000	That was the last year I went.
752000	756000	And, you know, it's getting to be a real crowded show, but it was always a good time.
756000	759000	So, you know, hope people that went had a good time.
759000	761000	So I just want to get that out there.
761000	765000	But what I do want to talk about here at the top of the show, I want to talk a little bit about old school.
765000	769000	And I want to talk about homebrew developments for old school consoles.
769000	773000	And when I say old school, how about the Mattel Intellivision?
773000	775000	Y'all remember the Intellivision?
775000	779000	Because they keep milking the Intellivision later on for retro collections and all that, right?
780000	782000	With the Intellivision Lives was a game at one point.
782000	785000	They had the Flashback console.
785000	787000	In fact, I think I actually own that one, the Intellivision Flashback.
787000	794000	Well, the reason why I bring back up the Intellivision is that just recently there was a new game released for the Intellivision.
794000	796000	That's right, Princess Lydie.
796000	798000	I hope I'm saying that right.
798000	806000	But Princess Lydie is kind of like a Snow Brothers, a Bubble Bobble-esque type of game that was released for the Intellivision.
806000	810000	And yeah, so you can check that out. The game is freely available.
810000	814000	But of course, you know, the developer would always appreciate a little bit of support if you do like that.
814000	819000	The game was created with Inti Basic, which is a basic interpreter for the Mattel Intellivision.
819000	824000	You can actually see, here's a little gif here in studio of the game in motion there.
824000	825000	So you can check that out.
825000	828000	There's more information over at the Atari Age forums.
828000	830000	Atariage.com.
830000	832000	And Bobby's asking for a spelling of that, so you can Google it.
832000	836000	Absolutely. It's Princess L-Y-D-I-E.
836000	840000	Princess Lydie? How about Lydie? Because it has die in it.
840000	842000	So, L-Y-D-I-E.
842000	844000	Maybe it's Lydie.
844000	848000	Lydie? I mean, I almost said Lydia, but Lydie? Oh well.
848000	851000	Anyway, there you go. You can check out that old game.
851000	856000	And why I thought I'd bring that up is kind of a two-part question here is that
857000	863000	Why do you think these old, old consoles still thrive with new releases and new games?
863000	868000	What do you think possesses people to make games for the Intellivision when
868000	871000	I would say very few people have those hooked up to their TVs anymore?
871000	874000	It's the big N-word. Nostalgia.
874000	878000	Nostalgia? Nintendo? Nintendo Nostalgia?
878000	880000	Just Nostalgia.
880000	881000	Nostalgia. Something about that.
881000	886000	Jamie, do you play any of these remakes, or I guess demakes if you will?
886000	889000	Or old, old games on systems?
889000	891000	Like Halo 2600. Did you give that a try?
891000	893000	No. No.
893000	896000	What do you think about the fact that new games still come out?
896000	899000	I had the Bayonetta down make.
899000	900000	Oh yeah, that was cool.
900000	901000	That was pretty fun. That was very cool.
901000	904000	Fantaz says, make a new Grand Theft Auto for Atari 2600.
904000	908000	Funny enough, that's actually how Retro City Rampage started.
908000	911000	It was a Grand Theft Auto game for the NES, a demake.
911000	914000	And then it just kind of blew up from there.
914000	920000	I would love for them to do the, I guess, emulator that they did for building Breath of the Wild.
920000	922000	Oh yeah.
922000	923000	Wouldn't that be nice?
923000	924000	Yeah.
924000	925000	I'd play the shit out of it.
925000	927000	That'll never see the light of day, but you never know.
927000	931000	Well let me ask, and speaking of, okay, let's talk about demakes.
931000	934000	Because remakes are all the rage, right?
934000	936000	We had Crash Bandicoot just got a remaster.
936000	939000	There's another one I'm sure you all are thinking of that we'll talk about a little later on tonight.
939000	945000	Heck, even the Halo trilogy got re-released on the Xbox One, right?
945000	947000	Actually, I think it was four Halo games that were re-released on Xbox One.
947000	954000	So anyway, all that aside, what game do you think should be demade?
954000	959000	What game do you think they need to revisit and do an old version of for an old console?
959000	961000	And I open this to the chatters as well.
961000	963000	Halo 2600 would be an example of this.
964000	967000	The Bayonetta demake that they did to promote Bayonetta on stream.
967000	969000	That's also another great example of that.
969000	972000	What game do you think should be demade?
972000	977000	Final Fantasy VII for the NES as an example, says Bobby Blackwolf.
977000	981000	Maybe do Final Fantasy VII as a text adventure a la Gemstone.
981000	983000	Oh, a text adventure game, like Zork.
983000	985000	Yeah, like Zork.
985000	987000	Okay, I like that.
987000	988000	What about other...
988000	990000	I think they should do a...
990000	994000	I don't know why, but my mind goes to what's all the rage right now in gaming.
994000	996000	I say 1 versus 100.
996000	999000	The player-verse, and I don't mean the game show, sadly.
999000	1001000	But the Player Unknown Battlegrounds and Fortnite.
1001000	1003000	That shit's all the rage right now.
1003000	1008000	So I would like to see a 100 versus 1 type of game, unlike the NES.
1008000	1010000	Like a party game.
1010000	1012000	You have to have a lot of multi-depths.
1012000	1014000	So what was that like?
1014000	1016000	Hide and go seek.
1016000	1018000	It was something... I remember the name now.
1018000	1020000	It was like Xeno... Xenophobe?
1020000	1022000	Was it Xenophobe?
1022000	1024000	There was one that had a top and a bottom screen,
1024000	1027000	and you could see different things going on.
1027000	1029000	Yeah, okay, so there was a game called Xenophobe,
1029000	1032000	and it was actually three layers in the arcade,
1032000	1035000	because it was a three-player game, and it was a side-scroller.
1035000	1038000	And the thing that made that game very novel
1038000	1042000	was that all three people were in the spaceport somewhere,
1042000	1044000	and all kind of like... I guess, yeah.
1044000	1045000	So it was kind of like fighting.
1045000	1047000	You know what game also that draws to mind?
1047000	1049000	You know what game Xenophobe was a lot like?
1049000	1051000	Spy versus Spy.
1051000	1052000	Remember that one?
1052000	1054000	And that was just two people,
1054000	1056000	but that was very much like a split-screen thing,
1056000	1058000	and you would try to hide the booby traps.
1058000	1059000	So okay, go with that.
1059000	1061000	So Spy versus Spy, but like 100 people.
1061000	1063000	That would be fun.
1063000	1064000	Yeah.
1064000	1065000	There you go.
1065000	1066000	Let's see.
1066000	1069000	Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
1069000	1073000	Alan Alchemy suggests BeatMania 2DX 2600.
1073000	1075000	Played with the paddle.
1075000	1078000	Get it? Because it's a turntable and a button.
1078000	1080000	I like that. That's a good idea.
1080000	1082000	DJ Hero has been demade.
1082000	1084000	Well, DJ Hero was.
1084000	1086000	DJ Hero was? For what system?
1086000	1089000	PC. It looked like a NES version.
1089000	1091000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. You're right.
1091000	1093000	They did like a promo thing for that.
1093000	1095000	Jamie, were you about to say something?
1095000	1096000	Parappa.
1096000	1098000	Parappa the Rapper?
1098000	1100000	The reason why I'm thinking about it is because
1100000	1102000	there was the scene where he goes into the cartridge,
1102000	1106000	and the worse you do, the worse the graphics get.
1106000	1109000	You know, it degrades by 8 bits each time.
1109000	1111000	And I was going to say, demade BeatMania.
1111000	1113000	That's basically the Game Boy Color version of the game.
1113000	1114000	Ah.
1115000	1117000	WonderSwan version.
1117000	1120000	Dr. Buster says, I'd play Final Fantasy 13 again
1120000	1123000	if it was turned into a 16-bit Super Nintendo game,
1123000	1125000	like their Lightning Returns trailer.
1125000	1127000	You know, they did a little joke with Final Fantasy 14
1127000	1129000	and that as well, where they had a group fighting Titan,
1129000	1131000	and it was really funny because the Dragoon
1131000	1133000	fell off the stage because it's kind of poking fun
1133000	1135000	at Dragoons being bad.
1135000	1138000	Fine, and I want Final Fantasy 14 done like
1138000	1140000	Fantasy Star Online.
1140000	1142000	So like, maybe the Dreamcast.
1142000	1145000	Sia Tabiri in chat says, Tiger,
1145000	1148000	I don't know if that's a throwback at the old LCD games,
1148000	1150000	Five Nights at Freddy's.
1150000	1153000	That's pretty good. I like that.
1153000	1156000	And that would work, like just the little hallways
1156000	1158000	being on the LCD screen.
1158000	1161000	On the game.com. I'm sorry, game.com.
1161000	1163000	I like that Five Nights at Freddy's is a great choice
1163000	1166000	because so many sequences in that game are already retro,
1166000	1167000	like some of the storytelling.
1167000	1170000	Have you seen the trailer for Outlast for the Switch?
1170000	1171000	No.
1171000	1173000	So they did like a trailer and there's like this dude
1173000	1175000	sitting in the cafe, all of a sudden there's like a jump scare
1175000	1177000	and he's like, ah!
1177000	1180000	Looking around like everyone's like, the fuck, dude?
1180000	1181000	Nice.
1182000	1185000	Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says there was also Guitar Hero 2
1185000	1187000	that's played more like Audio Surf.
1187000	1189000	Yeah, so that's, okay.
1189000	1191000	So, any other demakes you guys want to get out there
1191000	1193000	before we move on with the game?
1193000	1195000	I'm trying to think of other stuff that's really big right now.
1195000	1197000	It's funny because I keep thinking of Minecraft,
1197000	1200000	but Minecraft already has that look of an old game,
1200000	1202000	although it's 3D, so it's not old.
1202000	1206000	What if Minecraft was done kind of like Doom style?
1206000	1211000	Where it was all pixel done in 3D?
1211000	1214000	I was like, that's kind of how it looks already.
1214000	1218000	But it is actually 3D, like all of your characters are just 2D flat.
1218000	1220000	Oh, okay, I see what you mean.
1220000	1222000	And your extra assets are 2D flat.
1222000	1224000	It's Terraria.
1224000	1227000	But Terraria is like side view.
1227000	1230000	Wolfenstein 3D is a good example because that was a 2D game
1230000	1231000	in three dimensions.
1231000	1233000	Right, or like Hexen or Heretic.
1233000	1234000	Okay, I see where you're going.
1234000	1237000	You know, all those id software games.
1237000	1239000	MXC brings up a good point.
1239000	1243000	Brazil has a lot of demakes due to the continued popularity
1243000	1244000	of Sega Genesis.
1244000	1246000	And Sega Master System is the big thing.
1246000	1248000	I think they finally moved on to Genesis.
1248000	1252000	But a lot of games that came out on Genesis and later systems
1252000	1254000	actually have Master System ports.
1254000	1256000	You can only get them in Brazil.
1256000	1260000	You know, and sometimes we forget being that we're in the US
1260000	1262000	and so we're one of the countries that tends to get stuff
1262000	1263000	right when they come out.
1263000	1265000	There's a whole globe here,
1265000	1267000	and a lot of these countries in South America
1267000	1269000	and other parts of the world too,
1269000	1271000	they don't necessarily get stuff.
1271000	1273000	Like, you know, the PlayStation 4.
1273000	1275000	Did Mr. Smoosh finally knock the mic over?
1275000	1276000	Mr. Smoosh knocked it over.
1276000	1277000	He had it.
1277000	1280000	All right, anyway, so a lot of these other countries
1280000	1283000	don't have stuff right away.
1283000	1285000	So they have to kind of...
1285000	1287000	I bet there's a big, like, secondhand market too.
1287000	1290000	Like, I bet like GameStop, like the overage shit they can't sell,
1290000	1292000	they probably send to other countries
1292000	1295000	or they, you know, sell it to places in these other countries.
1295000	1298000	Well, and the other thing too is that the cost of import
1298000	1300000	for some of the newer systems is so great
1300000	1302000	that it ended up being more cost effective
1302000	1304000	to downgrade some of the games.
1304000	1309000	I mean, like, there's, I think, two iterations of Sonic the Hedgehog
1309000	1311000	other than the Game Gear one
1311000	1314000	that came out on Master System only in Brazil.
1314000	1316000	You know, we've got...
1316000	1317000	We emulated a few of them.
1317000	1321000	I mean, they're pretty fun, but still.
1321000	1322000	Yeah.
1322000	1323000	Fantasm Chat says,
1323000	1325000	I know people from Brazil.
1325000	1327000	Everything is so expensive there, it's ridiculous.
1327000	1329000	A hundred plus dollars for a game.
1329000	1331000	Yeah, I'm sure with all the importing, you know, fees
1331000	1333000	and then people want a cut of that and so forth,
1333000	1337000	I'm sure it's, you know, if the company doesn't officially exist there,
1337000	1340000	then you're basically paying import surcharges on everything,
1340000	1342000	so I'm sure it gets crazy.
1342000	1343000	All right, anyway.
1343000	1345000	Okay, that was a fun little conversation
1345000	1348000	since I know remakes are all the rage right now to talk about remakes.
1348000	1351000	Actually, speaking of Halo 2600, I did watch the making of that.
1351000	1353000	Like, there was, like, someone did a documentary on it
1353000	1357000	about how it was a guy at Rare, or not Rare, at Bungie
1357000	1359000	that basically, like, I just want to mess around
1359000	1361000	with making a game for the 2600.
1361000	1362000	It doesn't matter what it is,
1362000	1364000	and then you end up just drawing Master Chief.
1364000	1366000	Showed it to somebody, like, dude, you got to make that.
1366000	1367000	You got to make the whole game.
1367000	1369000	And so eventually, you know, you worked on it with some other people
1369000	1372000	to help, you know, build the sprites and everything.
1372000	1375000	You know, going back to the earlier question on why demakes,
1375000	1377000	I bet the challenge is it for a lot of people.
1377000	1378000	Yeah.
1378000	1380000	Because, you know, programming an Atari 2600 game,
1380000	1383000	like, you really have to, you can't write bloated code.
1383000	1385000	I hope he knows how to write assembly.
1385000	1386000	Yeah, right.
1386000	1389000	You really, I mean, that's maybe a good way to, like, practice and stuff.
1389000	1390000	I would have no idea how to do that stuff.
1390000	1392000	Yeah, it's extremely challenging.
1392000	1394000	And, like, I think it took the guy, like, a few years just to make it.
1394000	1395000	Wow.
1395000	1397000	It was just, it was more of just, like,
1397000	1399000	I want to challenge myself to be able to do this.
1399000	1400000	But some people do it for the thrill.
1400000	1401000	Yeah.
1401000	1403000	I'm not one of those people that will ever do that for the thrill.
1403000	1406000	Somebody in chat was saying very tongue-in-cheek
1406000	1408000	that you should demake It's Time to Car,
1408000	1410000	except you'd have to actually make it first.
1410000	1412000	Oh, it's already demade.
1413000	1415000	It's already in the trash compactor.
1415000	1416000	All right.
1416000	1419000	Let's talk a little more about some modern games.
1419000	1422000	Maybe, as we travel around our gaming weeks
1422000	1425000	and the types of video games that we've been playing this week,
1425000	1426000	and I say maybe because, I don't know,
1426000	1428000	maybe Dar Sacra went on a retro binge.
1428000	1429000	She does that sometimes.
1429000	1431000	How was your gaming week, Dar Sacra?
1431000	1433000	I bought more than I played.
1433000	1435000	I bought that.
1435000	1437000	That's just a Monday.
1437000	1439000	I bought Valhalla, finally.
1439000	1445000	Or the VA11, whatever, how it's spelled.
1445000	1454000	I also got Res HD, or whatever the remake was on Steam,
1454000	1456000	but I haven't played it yet.
1456000	1462000	I went to the thrift store, found just a stack as tall as I am,
1462000	1467000	practically, of Xbox 360 games in really great condition.
1467000	1470000	Ask me later which Goodwill I went to.
1470000	1472000	And a bunch of PS3 games.
1472000	1474000	So I picked up Ni No Kuni for PS3,
1474000	1479000	and I picked up an unwrapped copy of Titanfall for Xbox 360.
1479000	1482000	It was obviously some bro's collection
1482000	1485000	because there were a lot of Gears of War and all that in there.
1485000	1489000	I played some Pokemon Go.
1489000	1492000	I played a lot of Animal Crossing.
1493000	1496000	We, finally, I think, are done with Zelda.
1496000	1499000	We loaned Julie in our Wii U so he can finally play it.
1499000	1500000	Oh, that's cute.
1500000	1501000	Yeah.
1501000	1504000	And I played a bunch of Pinball
1504000	1510000	because we played a four-person versus game on Medieval Madness.
1510000	1513000	And that was really fun.
1513000	1517000	And played some World Cup Soccer and played some Black Knight 2000.
1517000	1519000	My Star Trek is broken.
1519000	1520000	Oh, no.
1520000	1521000	Upset.
1521000	1523000	But we might actually sell it.
1523000	1529000	I mean, it'd give us like $8,000 back in our bank, so that'd be nice.
1531000	1534000	Oh, no, I didn't really play much else, I think,
1534000	1538000	because I had a Passover Seder to get ready for.
1538000	1540000	So it was crazy.
1540000	1541000	I heard it was successful, so congrats.
1541000	1542000	It was.
1542000	1544000	There were 13 people apart from myself.
1544000	1545000	Nice.
1545000	1546000	That's a party.
1546000	1547000	As a party.
1547000	1548000	That is a party.
1548000	1550000	There was so many people stuffed into my kitchen.
1550000	1553000	All right, let me move on to Loki and your gaming week.
1553000	1555000	So I saw Ready Player One again.
1555000	1556000	Of course you did.
1556000	1557000	And no one surprised.
1557000	1558000	Yes.
1558000	1559000	I just thought about myself.
1559000	1562000	And Jamie and I are talking about going this week and Loki's like,
1562000	1563000	Ooh, win.
1563000	1564000	Like, of course you can come, Loki.
1564000	1566000	Let's figure it out.
1566000	1567000	So I did that.
1567000	1571000	And then I did play Far Cry 4 or 5.
1571000	1572000	I thought 5 was the new one.
1572000	1573000	Okay.
1573000	1574000	Yeah, Far Cry 5.
1574000	1576000	Does it have like a huge map or something?
1576000	1577000	It's a pretty big map,
1577000	1579000	but I haven't actually been playing too much of Far Cry 5.
1579000	1581000	I've been playing the Far Cry arcade stuff.
1581000	1584000	So I've been doing that.
1584000	1586000	And I've been doing this arcade hero mode,
1586000	1589000	which is basically, hey, play these maps that no one plays so you can rate them.
1589000	1591000	And they've all been terrible.
1591000	1593000	But it's been just fun just going through the terrible maps
1593000	1594000	because you also earn double experience.
1594000	1598000	And the experience you earn in that and the perk points and stuff
1598000	1599000	go into the main game too.
1599000	1602000	So like if I, it's an easy way to just earn,
1602000	1604000	like because the aim's kind of hard right now.
1604000	1607000	And so I just grinded that for a while.
1607000	1609000	And then, oh, hey, look at all these perks I unlocked.
1609000	1612000	And it makes the game easier when I actually go back and play Far Cry 5.
1612000	1615000	But I did actually play some Far Cry 5 as well
1615000	1620000	because I was trying to get to this one way point on there, like this prison.
1620000	1624000	And so I had to drive through all this area with a bunch of bad guys and stuff.
1624000	1629000	And so there was this hunter, this hunting spot that you can go to.
1629000	1632000	And so I went up to the hunter or whatever,
1632000	1634000	and then she gets attacked by a mountain lion.
1634000	1636000	And so then I waited for the mountain lion to kill her,
1636000	1637000	and then I killed the mountain lion.
1637000	1640000	And I got to loot both of them. So win-win.
1640000	1644000	And then of course more DDR. What was it?
1644000	1646000	I'm down 16 pounds now.
1646000	1648000	And I've been playing...
1648000	1649000	Congrats, by the way.
1649000	1651000	I've been playing doubles again.
1651000	1654000	So I'm playing mostly doubles and doing non-stops of doubles.
1654000	1657000	I've been finding that doing random caprice every time,
1657000	1660000	which is that kind of it's like you can see which songs they are,
1660000	1662000	but it's different every time you play it.
1662000	1664000	That's been all right.
1664000	1668000	Anytime I try to do random all, you know, it's just like,
1668000	1672000	Oh, hey, let's throw in Trip Machine Survivor.
1672000	1673000	Okay, that's cool. You passed that.
1673000	1675000	Now let's throw Legend of Max in there.
1675000	1678000	It's like, what the fuck? I mean, seriously.
1678000	1684000	Can you just mix it up a bit instead of boss song, boss song, boss song?
1684000	1687000	So it's just, I don't know.
1687000	1690000	And then like I said, I was setting up my arcade cabinet.
1690000	1696000	And unfortunately the something with the graphics card I think is broken.
1696000	1698000	So I get no image on the screen.
1698000	1700000	Hopefully it's not the actual screen that's broken.
1700000	1701000	I don't think so.
1701000	1703000	I'd be more likely to believe it's the PC
1703000	1706000	because that graphics card is like wiggling all around in there.
1706000	1712000	So I would not be surprised in the least that something's broken there.
1712000	1716000	So I had to kind of play around, hook it up to some different monitors
1716000	1719000	to see if I can actually see an image and try to troubleshoot that.
1719000	1723000	But I just thought I would set that up since it's just been sitting in a corner gathering dust.
1723000	1726000	And eventually I'll probably sell it.
1726000	1729000	Because I did promise I would do that when I got the DDR machine.
1729000	1733000	So I'll have to do that because I haven't been playing it.
1733000	1735000	And that's pretty much it.
1735000	1738000	Okay. Let me talk about my gaming week.
1738000	1740000	Still some old favorites.
1740000	1741000	Been playing Pokemon Go.
1741000	1744000	Finally caught a Latios at one of the raids over the weekend.
1744000	1745000	So that was good.
1745000	1748000	Let's see, also still playing Overwatch.
1748000	1750000	Having fun with that.
1750000	1752000	Been playing a lot of Mystery Heroes.
1752000	1754000	Kind of getting back into that.
1754000	1756000	I feel like I'm just doing better.
1756000	1757000	Knock on wood.
1757000	1759000	But I feel like I'm just getting some good matches.
1759000	1760000	And I'm winning as much as I'm losing.
1760000	1761000	And that feels nice.
1761000	1764000	That's where I want to be is an even win-loss ratio.
1764000	1768000	And continuing to play some Heroes of the Storm and Final Fantasy XIV.
1768000	1772000	And some of the newer things that I've continued on recently.
1772000	1774000	Ni No Kuni 2 I'm still playing.
1774000	1776000	I have been streaming all of my gameplay.
1776000	1778000	I'm up to about eight and a half hours in.
1778000	1780000	And all of it's been streamed over on my Twitch stream.
1780000	1782000	Cheap plug, Rob Roberts.
1782000	1784000	But I'm really enjoying Ni No Kuni 2.
1784000	1787000	It's different from the first game.
1787000	1789000	Like the battle system is completely different.
1789000	1795000	And there's this whole kingdom management system thing that kind of feels like a mobile phone game.
1795000	1800000	But it's also not because the things you do to grow your kingdom are not necessarily paying 99 cents.
1800000	1803000	There's no money transactions in the game like that.
1803000	1805000	But it's actually go do this quest.
1805000	1807000	And then you'll get another person to join your kingdom.
1807000	1809000	And I kind of like that.
1809000	1811000	It's like Actraiser.
1811000	1813000	Kind of in that regard.
1813000	1815000	A lot of people comparing it to Suikoden.
1815000	1817000	Where you try to get all the people to convince them to join your kingdom.
1817000	1819000	A lot of people comparing it to that.
1819000	1822000	But yeah, I'm enjoying that and all the side questing.
1822000	1825000	So I'm going to continue to stream that. Play more of that.
1825000	1827000	I'm having a lot of fun with that game.
1827000	1829000	And I did not beat the first game.
1829000	1832000	And I do not feel like my experience on Ni No Kuni 2 is diminished.
1833000	1835000	I think it's very much like Final Fantasy.
1835000	1840000	Where it's just, you know, they are similar in their art style and some of the location names.
1840000	1842000	But otherwise, probably not connected.
1842000	1844000	So, there you go.
1844000	1846000	Let's see.
1846000	1849000	And other newer stuff I've been playing this week.
1849000	1853000	I was trying to think. There's one other game I want to talk about.
1853000	1855000	Oh, I lost my train of thought.
1855000	1857000	What else did I play this week?
1857000	1859000	There was a new...
1859000	1861000	Oh, I want to talk about DJ Max.
1861000	1864000	Because I was just playing that earlier today actually before the show.
1864000	1869000	Because DJ Max Respect actually had some new DLC released for it.
1869000	1872000	So now they have the Classic Y edition.
1872000	1874000	You can get all those songs, which is great.
1874000	1876000	They have a Technica expansion pack.
1876000	1878000	So yeah, I'm loving that.
1878000	1880000	Because all those songs are really good.
1880000	1882000	Especially the Classic Y pack.
1882000	1885000	Like if you have DJ Max, you want to get the Classic Y pack.
1885000	1890000	It almost actually makes me want to go back and alter maybe what I said a little bit a couple weeks ago on OLR.
1890000	1895000	About how DJ Max... I didn't really care for the music as much as I did in BeatMania 2DX.
1895000	1899000	Because these expansion packs and these DLC music packs are really good.
1899000	1901000	Like the songs are really good in the DLC packs.
1901000	1904000	Even though they're not necessarily licensed things.
1904000	1909000	I hear that the developers are not super happy with the performance of the game in the West.
1909000	1913000	I think you need to strongly consider...
1913000	1916000	I mean, they're probably having to pay a license fee for some of these DLC.
1916000	1919000	So you might want to consider bundling some of it in.
1919000	1922000	Or you might want to consider really dropping the cost on the base game.
1922000	1926000	I think if the base game came down to $20, probably more people would pick it up.
1926000	1929000	And then you could probably make some more money off these DLC expansions.
1929000	1931000	That would be my advice to the developers.
1931000	1933000	$50, digitally only.
1933000	1937000	It's a lot to ask for what is essentially kind of an itch thing.
1937000	1939000	I paid it because I like music games.
1939000	1942000	And I realize it's a very well-rounded game.
1942000	1946000	But it might be a hard sell on a greater scale otherwise.
1947000	1950000	Yeah, that's I guess about it for my gaming week.
1950000	1952000	So, cool.
1952000	1954000	You can follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
1954000	1957000	We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
1957000	1961000	As far as any housekeeping, we should be having shows pretty solid over the next couple months.
1961000	1963000	We took a nice little two-week break there.
1963000	1968000	So we should be having shows right up at least through our 16th anniversary show in mid-June.
1968000	1971000	So, just kind of a random train of thought here.
1971000	1973000	I know we're in April right now.
1974000	1979000	When is the indie arcade? Isn't that like right around this time?
1979000	1982000	I'm not sure they're doing it this year, actually.
1982000	1984000	I have not seen any of the promotion for it. You're right.
1984000	1986000	It would have been around this weekend.
1986000	1989000	I do know that Bree actually had a baby.
1989000	1990000	Oh, yeah.
1990000	1995000	Yeah, so I think just probably, you know, I know she worked really hard to put all that together.
1995000	1998000	Certainly Gabe did stuff too, but he actually released his game and so forth.
1998000	2002000	So, I think they probably just put it on pause for this year.
2002000	2004000	As far as saying no, I haven't heard anything official.
2004000	2007000	Yeah, that's definitely fine. I was like, oh shit, did I forget about it?
2007000	2009000	It would have been around this time, yeah.
2009000	2011000	So, I think it didn't happen this year.
2011000	2012000	So, we'll just hope it comes back this year.
2012000	2014000	It gives me more time to work on a game.
2014000	2015000	That's right.
2015000	2016000	There you go.
2016000	2019000	That's right. You can plan for next year. Absolutely right.
2019000	2026000	Also, I know they had the collaborative office space that they had here.
2026000	2027000	Yeah, yeah.
2027000	2028000	It actually closed.
2028000	2029000	Oh, that's sad.
2029000	2031000	So, yeah, you know.
2031000	2033000	Those collab office spaces are kind of hard.
2033000	2034000	It can be.
2034000	2035000	It can be.
2035000	2037000	Well, I know the hacker lab downtown does really, really well.
2037000	2040000	So, maybe there just wasn't enough demand for the second thing.
2040000	2043000	Well, they're also sponsored by my company as well.
2043000	2045000	That probably works.
2045000	2050000	Our development innovation lab is literally across the street.
2050000	2055000	But we will be keeping our eyes on the Sacramento Indie Gamer Collective.
2055000	2060000	And anything comes up that we need to let you all know about, we will bring it up right here on OLR.
2060000	2061000	So, cool.
2061000	2064000	Alright, well, let's get into some gaming news then for the night.
2064000	2065000	And we'll start with you, Loki.
2065000	2066000	Alright.
2066000	2068000	So, Final Fantasy XV.
2068000	2073000	The game that I have, and I literally stared at the title card a couple days ago.
2073000	2075000	I'm like, I should go back and play that.
2075000	2077000	Because I've only played like ten minutes of it.
2077000	2079000	And I really should play it.
2079000	2081000	And then I went to play Far Cry 5 instead.
2081000	2082000	So, you know.
2082000	2089000	But Final Fantasy XV, you know, they were very dedicated to putting out DLC for the game.
2089000	2092000	And that doesn't look like it's going to quit anytime soon.
2092000	2098000	In fact, they even outlined some new episodes that are going to be coming out over the next year for Final Fantasy.
2098000	2105000	So, four new episodes are scheduled, including some that focus on Ardyn, Lunafreya, Noctis.
2105000	2111000	And they said that a shorter side story episode as well for Arania Highwind.
2111000	2117000	And they didn't really say what exactly, you know, any details on that.
2117000	2123000	But also, I guess, maybe some other multiplayer focused stuff as well.
2123000	2125000	Some comrades expansions.
2125000	2128000	So, lots of stuff coming out next year.
2128000	2132000	Well, I like that they're doing a DLC side story for Arania.
2132000	2139000	Because, you know, she was a really strong character that seems like she kind of got cut short in a lot of the corners they cut to get the game out in a reasonable time.
2140000	2147000	And that's, I don't know, that's kind of what bugs me about this whole fact that they've got these continuing, developing things through 2019.
2147000	2148000	Is I just feel like...
2148000	2150000	So, when's the game of the year edition going to come?
2150000	2152000	Or when's the game going to be finished?
2152000	2155000	So I can play through the story and get the story as it was intended.
2155000	2161000	But I've been reading these hot takes on Twitter that are like, well, that's a very, you know, it's a very...
2161000	2163000	I don't even know what word to use.
2163000	2170000	It's a very spoiled perspective because the developers are continuing to support the game all this time after development.
2170000	2174000	And we should be thankful that more developers are pouring into their game and all this stuff.
2174000	2176000	And I'm just like, come on.
2176000	2184000	Like, I fucking hate it when these types of hot takes are meant, are written in a way to make the other side, like, feel bad.
2184000	2187000	Like, you should feel bad for your opinion that you are hating on this stuff.
2187000	2190000	Look, I bought Final Fantasy XV when it came out.
2190000	2194000	The developers got my money, so I can bitch and moan all I want on my Twitter.
2194000	2196000	If you don't want me to feel bad, you should be less of a cunt.
2196000	2200000	It's one of those things where I'm just like, okay.
2200000	2206000	But I'm frustrated because I went and I played through this whole game and then it's like, oh, we're going to go back and change chapter 13.
2206000	2208000	It's just, it's a problem nowadays.
2208000	2209000	Oh, we're going to go back and change this.
2209000	2214000	It's like, could you let me know when the game is just fucking done so I can play the game that's intended?
2214000	2216000	And that is a problem.
2216000	2223000	I think with a lot of these big publishers out there, it's like, okay, you get this incentive if you release the game now.
2223000	2227000	Or, hey, we're forcing the releases now to avoid any penalties.
2227000	2232000	And then, or you could finish it and release it later.
2232000	2235000	It's like, well, we'll just release it now. We'll patch it later.
2235000	2237000	It seems to be the mentality of it.
2237000	2238000	It's the new normal.
2238000	2242000	And it's sad that it's normal because it wasn't like that before.
2242000	2246000	You had one chance to get it right and it had to be right.
2246000	2247000	And that was it.
2247000	2250000	But now it's like, ah, fuck it, whatever.
2250000	2254000	We'll just, we'll just fix the bugs as we go along.
2254000	2259000	Or it's the other extreme like Mass Effect Andromeda where it's like, oh, it didn't do well.
2259000	2260000	Drop it like a hot potato.
2260000	2263000	The DLC that was expected, not canceled.
2263000	2264000	We'll just write a book about it.
2264000	2271000	And it's like, okay, well, that's a little, see, I feel a little differently about like DLC and the additional like DLC and that stuff.
2271000	2276000	Because with a lot of DLC, it's usually like an extra episode.
2276000	2277000	It's a continuation.
2277000	2279000	It's a separation, especially in Mass Effect.
2279000	2283000	I thought Mass Effect did this very well, especially the last one they did for Mass Effect 3.
2283000	2284000	What was that?
2284000	2286000	Citadel? Was the name of that very last one they did for Mass Effect 3?
2286000	2288000	The Citadel was fan service, the DLC.
2288000	2296000	It was, but I loved it because it really felt like this separate experience from the game that, you know, enhanced the main game.
2296000	2298000	And some of this in 15 they're doing.
2298000	2300000	And I don't, you know, that's cool.
2300000	2301000	And I'm okay with that stuff.
2301000	2306000	But it's like the fact that they're going back and continuing to enhance things that are like in the main game.
2306000	2311000	That's the stuff that kind of bothers me is it's like, well, then, so you're not done with the main game.
2311000	2315000	And it just kind of goes back to this whole like, you know, the game took years and years and years to develop.
2315000	2318000	But we all know the real development didn't happen to the last two years.
2318000	2320000	And then it was fucking confusing.
2320000	2324000	Oh, by the way, you need to watch this short film in order to finally grasp everything.
2324000	2325000	You don't. I didn't watch the short film.
2325000	2327000	You don't need to watch it.
2327000	2328000	Why even release it?
2328000	2330000	Some of it's like an extra thing, I guess.
2330000	2333000	Some of it's incorporated into the game itself, I think.
2333000	2335000	So, there you go.
2335000	2337000	Dungeonbuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
2337000	2345000	speaking of Final Fantasy 15, watched some Tekken gameplay with Noctis and it's like he totally belongs there.
2345000	2347000	I'm not surprised to hear that.
2347000	2348000	In Tekken?
2348000	2349000	Yeah.
2349000	2350000	Noctis is in Tekken?
2350000	2351000	Yeah, yeah. Remember that?
2351000	2353000	He's announced as a DLC character for Tekken 7.
2353000	2354000	Yeah.
2354000	2355000	I mean, that's cool.
2355000	2356000	Yeah, no, it's cool.
2356000	2358000	I wouldn't doubt that he probably belongs there.
2358000	2368000	So, anybody still in, or I guess now that, was it, Dissidia came out, anybody even give a shit about that?
2368000	2371000	I tried the demo and I could not get into it.
2371000	2374000	Or, I shouldn't say demo, the open beta or whatever it was they had.
2374000	2376000	I could not get into it.
2376000	2382000	Like, it was kind of complicated for a fighting game, which is fine, and I kind of like could have stuck with that,
2382000	2386000	but it's just, I was thinking that Dissidia would be like a Tekken type of game with Final Fantasy characters.
2386000	2388000	It's really not that at all.
2388000	2389000	Yeah.
2389000	2391000	Yeah, so, I don't know, I just wasn't into it.
2391000	2393000	Is it too late to hold out host for an Urgats 2?
2393000	2394000	I mean, because...
2394000	2395000	Yes.
2395000	2396000	Oh, damn it.
2396000	2398000	I'm not sure that Dissidia is selling very well.
2398000	2403000	I could be wrong, but I'm not sure it's doing very well, so I'm not sure Square is going to continue this fighting game thing.
2403000	2404000	So, we'll see.
2404000	2407000	You know where they should really throw in their efforts, though?
2407000	2415000	And I would be shocked if they don't try this, at least after Mario Kart comes out for iOS and Android.
2415000	2417000	New Chocobo Racing game.
2417000	2419000	Oh, man, that I would be on board for, heck yeah.
2419000	2421000	And I could see them doing that.
2421000	2422000	Hey, Chocobo Racing.
2422000	2423000	Put it on mobile.
2423000	2424000	Hell yeah.
2424000	2428000	I mean, eh, but you know, hey, if that's what we got to do to get a new one.
2428000	2429000	Right.
2429000	2430000	Still, eh, but you know.
2430000	2432000	No, I get you, I get you.
2432000	2433000	So, alright.
2433000	2435000	Well, let's move on to something else.
2435000	2442000	Although, I got to say, it's hard because when I do see people playing Final Fantasy XV on stream, I'm always like, oh, I should go and play this again.
2442000	2443000	Or they can at least make it.
2443000	2446000	And then they see a story like this and I'm like, oh, yeah, it's not done.
2446000	2450000	Make like a decent VR thing because that fishing thing is stupid.
2450000	2451000	Correct.
2451000	2455000	Alright, anyway, let's talk about Spyro.
2455000	2458000	That's right, Spyro the Dragon is making a comeback.
2458000	2459000	That's pretty exciting.
2460000	2462000	Just in time for the 20th anniversary of Spyro.
2462000	2466000	Spyro is going to be coming back in the Spyro Reignited Trilogy.
2466000	2468000	The Skylander developers Toys for Bob.
2468000	2471000	This is what they're doing now because I don't think Skylanders.
2471000	2472000	Yeah, it's done.
2472000	2475000	So, Spyro, which makes sense because Spyro was in Skylanders, right?
2475000	2476000	I think that did happen.
2476000	2480000	Yeah, it was Spyro in the Skylanders or something like that.
2480000	2483000	It was Skylanders, Spyro, something or other.
2483000	2485000	He was in the very first title.
2485000	2486000	Yeah.
2486000	2488000	And then it was like, oh, he's not the focus anymore.
2488000	2489000	Yeah.
2489000	2495000	So, anyway, Spyro the Dragon, Spyro 2, Ripto's Rage, and Spyro Year of the Dragon are all going to be in this.
2495000	2500000	New remastered graphics and music and all that available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
2500000	2503000	The release date, September 21st.
2503000	2510000	$39.99 if you want to pre-order it and I'm sure any store is happy to take your money right now for that.
2510000	2515000	Interesting to note, these original games were actually originally developed by Insomniac Games,
2515000	2520000	who are now doing that big Spider-Man game that also got a release date this week, if I'm not mistaken.
2520000	2521000	Also in September.
2521000	2524000	I think that's coming up later in the show. I might be spoiling that a little bit.
2524000	2528000	But anyway, yeah, so that's something else to look forward to.
2528000	2530000	So, what do you guys think about Spyro coming back?
2530000	2533000	I'm more excited about this than Crash Bandicoot, actually.
2533000	2534000	I've never played a Spyro game.
2534000	2535000	Really?
2535000	2536000	Really?
2536000	2537000	I was never into it.
2537000	2539000	I played the first two, I think.
2539000	2542000	They were solid platformers.
2542000	2547000	The first one was one of the first games I bought on the original PlayStation and I think that's why I'm excited to try this.
2547000	2549000	3D cutting-edge graphics for the time, yeah.
2549000	2550000	For the time, yeah.
2550000	2555000	And that 3D platformer, it was kind of the closest thing PlayStation had to Mario 64, but it was different.
2555000	2558000	I don't want to compare Spyro to Mario 64, but it was different.
2558000	2559000	It was a good game.
2559000	2560000	Yeah.
2560000	2565000	It's one of those games now that a lot of PlayStation games, man, you go back to them and it's like,
2565000	2568000	yeah, this didn't hold up that well.
2568000	2570000	It's a pretty good game.
2570000	2574000	But do you think with the remaster and the graphics and everything, it'll hold up a lot better?
2574000	2575000	Yeah, I think it'll hold up a lot better.
2575000	2577000	I'm not buying it, but it'll hold up a lot better.
2577000	2578000	I think I will.
2578000	2579000	I'll buy it.
2579000	2581000	Why not?
2581000	2582000	Is it coming out on PC, though?
2582000	2583000	They didn't say PC.
2583000	2585000	They didn't say PC, but it probably will.
2585000	2586000	It's too bad.
2586000	2588000	Did the Crash Collection come out on PC?
2588000	2590000	I don't know if it ever did.
2590000	2591000	It might.
2591000	2592000	There's another series I haven't played.
2592000	2593000	Really?
2593000	2594000	You haven't played Crash Bandicoot either?
2594000	2595000	I was never into it.
2595000	2596000	I thought it looked ridiculous.
2596000	2598000	And so the listeners might be thinking, watch this.
2598000	2603000	But you were very much a Sega girl, too, if these games weren't on Dreamcast.
2603000	2604000	Really?
2604000	2606000	Growing up, I had a Super Nintendo.
2606000	2608000	No, but this was after Super Nintendo.
2608000	2610000	This would have been like your college years.
2610000	2614000	Well, no, I never had a PlayStation when they came out.
2614000	2619000	I didn't have access to a PlayStation until I lived with Candace.
2619000	2623000	And I only bought one game, and that was Final Fantasy VII.
2623000	2625000	But you did have a Dreamcast right when it came out, right?
2625000	2627000	Well, we had a Japanese Dreamcast, and then we had...
2627000	2628000	And you had a 32X, right?
2628000	2630000	Well, Dan did when I moved right here.
2630000	2635000	The only remaster collection I'm interested in right now is whenever they announce a Ridge
2635000	2637000	Racer remaster collection.
2637000	2638000	Give me a new R4.
2638000	2639000	New R4.
2639000	2641000	I'm on board with that.
2641000	2643000	R4 had the best soundtrack.
2643000	2648000	Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, JD suggests, hold out for Switch.
2648000	2652000	You know, there's a lot of people that are asking, where's the Switch edition of this?
2652000	2653000	It's probably gonna...
2653000	2656000	I think maybe they just didn't announce it, but it's...
2656000	2657000	You think it's...
2657000	2658000	I think it's a guarantee.
2658000	2659000	I think it's something it'll probably happen to.
2659000	2660000	Okay, I have to say this now.
2660000	2663000	If anyone hears burping noises in the background, it's me.
2663000	2664000	It's you.
2664000	2665000	It's the cat.
2665000	2666000	It's Mr. Smooshin.
2666000	2668000	No, it's because of my stupid digestion problems.
2668000	2670000	So, I'm gonna burp, sorry.
2670000	2671000	It's...
2671000	2673000	Burp like a lady.
2673000	2674000	Girl.
2674000	2677000	So, whatever.
2677000	2680000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Ridge Racer.
2680000	2682000	Oh, that joke will never die.
2682000	2683000	Let's see.
2683000	2687000	Dartusia says, I thought I heard it got rated somewhere for a Switch version, but it wasn't
2687000	2688000	officially announced yet.
2688000	2690000	Yes, I do believe that was out there.
2690000	2691000	Was it this week?
2691000	2692000	I think it was...
2692000	2693000	Was it the guy from...
2693000	2696000	I'm trying to remember which company.
2696000	2697000	There was somebody.
2697000	2701000	I remember, because now we're talking about Ridge Racer and stuff, and that made me think
2701000	2708000	of CEO Kazurai, and someone was actually following him and thought he was the actual CEO of Sony.
2708000	2711000	And I never realized that that was a parody account or something.
2711000	2712000	Oh my god, that's funny.
2712000	2713000	It was funny.
2713000	2714000	I wanna say...
2714000	2715000	It took him this long to figure it out?
2715000	2716000	I don't remember.
2716000	2718000	I think it was someone at Take-Two or 2K or something like that.
2718000	2720000	I don't remember, but it was hilarious.
2720000	2721000	That's pretty funny.
2721000	2724000	At least they weren't DMing secrets or anything like that.
2724000	2725000	That's good.
2725000	2726000	All right.
2726000	2728000	Well, anyway, let's move on past Spyro.
2728000	2730000	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
2730000	2732000	Oh, those shenanigans.
2732000	2734000	Shenanigans.
2734000	2742000	So, we now have a new fighter entering this brawl over the net neutrality repeal, and
2742000	2744000	that is the ESA.
2744000	2753000	So, they have jumped on in, and they are joining the lawsuit against the FCC over the repeal
2753000	2754000	of net neutrality.
2754000	2758000	I need to write whoever wrote this fucking article that appeal and repeal are not the
2758000	2761000	same fucking thing.
2761000	2763000	Just saying.
2763000	2768000	But they applied to join in, and their whole thing on that...
2768000	2773000	And I'll just read the statement, going into the important part.
2773000	2777000	In particular, broadband providers are now permitted to engage in practices that degrade
2777000	2778000	consumers' traffic.
2778000	2783000	That, in turn, could have significant consequences for the enjoyment of multiplayer online games
2783000	2788000	and cloud-based gameplay services, both of which require low-latency connections to support
2788000	2791000	rapid and continuous interactivity.
2791000	2797000	And that's assuming that the intent is to throttle and have different paid tiers, which
2797000	2801000	we haven't had anything lead to that yet.
2801000	2809000	But, I will say this, any industry left unregulated is going to take advantage of whatever they
2809000	2811000	can to make the bottom line.
2811000	2815000	We have seen this over and over in history.
2815000	2820000	Do not trust capitalist, you know, do not trust a capitalist society.
2820000	2822000	They're going to fuck you for the money.
2822000	2824000	That's just how it works.
2824000	2828000	Not that I want to say I'm for...
2828000	2831000	Not that I want to say I'm against net neutrality, because that's definitely not where my head
2831000	2832000	is at.
2832000	2836000	But this is more coming from my whole, my brain is preparing for the worst, that this
2836000	2839000	is the reality that we're going to have to accept that they're going to get their way
2839000	2842000	and that net neutrality is going to be gone.
2842000	2845000	Is it going to be as bad as people think it is?
2845000	2851000	Because there's a part of me that says that the consumers getting to regulate the market
2851000	2856000	in some of the markets where there is competition, not here, unfortunately, we have one choice,
2856000	2857000	that's it.
2857000	2861000	But in some of the more competitive places, I would think that consumers aren't going
2861000	2867000	to let these companies get away with charging $10 for a Netflix bundle and all this other
2867000	2868000	shit.
2868000	2869000	I don't think it's going to get nickel to dime that way.
2869000	2875000	Except the thing is that the people who are part of the lawmaking process don't listen
2875000	2876000	to their constituents.
2876000	2878000	They listen to the money that goes into their pockets.
2878000	2879000	I know, I know.
2879000	2882000	But that's why I'm like, I'm just preparing for that this is going to be the way it is
2882000	2884000	because...
2884000	2888000	I'm not looking, I'm not speculating anything about the future.
2888000	2890000	I'm looking at the past.
2890000	2893000	And those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.
2893000	2897000	And we've seen what unregulated industry does.
2897000	2902000	We've seen, I mean, again, I brought it up before, but the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory
2902000	2905000	Fire, where they locked women inside to make them work.
2905000	2907000	Child labor.
2907000	2912000	An unregulated industry is going to do whatever it can to make the bottom line as cheap as
2912000	2913000	possible.
2913000	2919000	Or like we should even remember, the same goddamn industry, not just several years,
2919000	2921000	or a couple decades ago.
2921000	2922000	Remember Ma Bell?
2922000	2926000	Remember when they had to break up the Bell companies because it was just this giant fucking
2926000	2928000	monopoly from phone service?
2928000	2929000	Yeah.
2929000	2930000	Remember that?
2930000	2932000	How is Comcast not at that same point?
2932000	2934000	It's the same goddamn thing.
2934000	2938000	Comcast's acquisitions haven't been as big as the whole Spectrum Time Warner.
2938000	2940000	Comcast owns a fucking network.
2940000	2942000	They own NBC.
2942000	2946000	But the other ones you're looking at in terms of just internet?
2946000	2950000	You've got that whole series of acquisitions done by AT&T.
2950000	2951000	Yeah.
2951000	2953000	You've got that whole series of acquisitions.
2953000	2958000	Now Time Warner and Spectrum have merged, and they bought Roadrunner, they bought all
2958000	2961000	kinds of local ISPs.
2961000	2963000	Here's what's going to happen with the net neutrality thing.
2963000	2967000	And I'm building a little bit on what Bobby Blackwell said, so I want to give credit to
2967000	2969000	him and his show because he talked a little bit about this.
2969000	2973000	I kind of think the data caps are going to be what comes into play with this, but in
2973000	2975000	a little bit of a different way than what Bobby said.
2975000	2980000	Because as 4K gets more and more adopted, we're going to use more and more bandwidth.
2980000	2986000	Comcast, which is the big provider out there, upped all those bandwidth tiers to 1 terabyte,
2986000	2987000	1,000 gigabytes.
2987000	2988000	That's where we're at now.
2988000	2993000	Well, as 4K becomes more and more the standard, and as the internet gets faster and faster
2993000	2997000	enough to deliver 4K on demand, which is where we're going to be in five years.
2997000	3002000	Well, yeah, and the internet has to get faster because my service speed hasn't gone up.
3002000	3004000	But those data caps, they may not bulge.
3004000	3009000	But here's where net neutrality and that whole thing, if it does not come back, here's where
3009000	3010000	that whole thing is going to get you.
3010000	3011000	This is what Comcast is going to do.
3011000	3014000	I don't think it's going to happen quite the same way that Bobby was saying on his show,
3014000	3016000	but I think they will do.
3016000	3024000	They're going to say, oh, but through Xfinity and our movies and our phone service and the
3024000	3030000	things that are through Comcast, we're not going to put towards your data caps.
3030000	3036000	So if you use your 4K movies through Xfinity, what do they call the Comcast TV thing?
3036000	3037000	Is that what it is?
3037000	3038000	I don't know.
3038000	3039000	X1 or whatever.
3039000	3040000	X1.
3040000	3045000	If you do it through that, it won't count towards the data cap because they kind of
3045000	3046000	did that before.
3046000	3047000	AT&T did that before.
3047000	3050000	I think T-Mobile does that right now or Verizon.
3050000	3051000	Somebody does that with theirs.
3051000	3052000	Oh, yeah.
3052000	3056000	So that's, and that whole thing is that it's like, oh, if you stay in our ecosystem and
3056000	3062000	you are buying your movies on demand through us and not through Apple TV or something like
3062000	3064000	that, then it won't count towards data cap.
3064000	3068000	But if you go out to Apple TV or you go out to Amazon Prime and you buy it there, oh,
3068000	3071000	that's going to count towards data cap.
3071000	3075000	I don't think, because I don't think the market is going to let, I mean, I totally
3075000	3077000	respect your perspective and everything.
3077000	3080000	And again, I want to reemphasize, I want net neutrality to come back.
3080000	3082000	I'm trying to deal with what is the future going to look like.
3082000	3085000	Well, even if it doesn't come back, I'm hopeful with this.
3085000	3091000	It seems like a lot of states are pushing for their own utilities for this stuff, which
3091000	3092000	it really should be.
3092000	3093000	You know something like that's going to pass here.
3093000	3098000	Yeah, it really should be something that's like a utility that basically, you know, put
3098000	3101000	it through the power system or something like that.
3101000	3105000	You know, they have the whole new internet over power type stuff.
3105000	3109000	Azet in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, get rid of pie.
3109000	3111000	Yes, that smug motherfucker.
3111000	3113000	I fucking hate that guy.
3113000	3119000	The one guy that won't fucking leave Washington.
3119000	3122000	Well, he's in trouble right now for the whole Sinclair stuff.
3122000	3125000	That's a whole other ball of shit.
3125000	3128000	I'm just going to put it this way.
3128000	3132000	We have elections this year.
3132000	3136000	There's another series of elections, of course, in 2020.
3136000	3142000	And there are enough people who hate those motherfuckers right now that we're going to see a big change.
3142000	3144000	Make it happen, people.
3144000	3146000	You need to vote.
3146000	3149000	If you live in this country, you need to vote.
3149000	3154000	I'm not going to tell you how to vote, but you need to, and not just vote for whoever has a cool name.
3154000	3161000	You need to go vote for, although, like, you know, if somebody, you know, named like Rob Roberts was actually running for office, I probably would do that.
3161000	3169000	But anyway, no, seriously, you need to do your research and know, like, what are these candidates and, you know, know where they stand and know that they are like four things you want.
3169000	3178000	Because when people don't vote, then people get a say that you may not want to have the say, but they have the say because they voted.
3178000	3185000	So the other the other thing, too, is, I mean, we definitely because I think this is a big part of it.
3185000	3191000	That's the only reason I'm bringing it up. But we need to have caps on lobbying as well.
3191000	3201000	You know, lobbying needs to be on equal terms without there being because that's how we get, you know, I would I would be what with 100 percent certainty.
3201000	3208000	The whole reason that neutrality repealed is because the ISPs are paying lobbyists to make them think that this is right.
3208000	3213000	They're getting a lot there. They're being legally bribed is what it is.
3213000	3216000	And in chat, there's talk about the whole Oprah for president.
3216000	3221000	She won't do it. No, no more celebrities in government.
3221000	3226000	No more like seriously. When was the last good celebrity in government?
3226000	3230000	There was. OK, maybe Jesse Ventura.
3230000	3238000	Depending on where you are politically. I would even give and look, as as somebody who does lean left, I would not usually name Ronald Reagan, but I will give you that.
3238000	3242000	I realize a lot of fucked up the economy. I realize a lot of people are fans.
3242000	3248000	I will give you that. But that was in the 80s. Reagan fucked up our economy. Maybe Sonny Bono.
3248000	3256000	OK, I was going to say and I can't. Al Franken. Well, until what happened is that he was completely terrible to women.
3256000	3261000	But we need to just throw out the scope of terrible the women thing, though.
3261000	3267000	I mean, it's definitely. Well, whatever. There's a whole nother layer of the onion.
3267000	3274000	I don't think we should be peeling back right now. But the the the big thing is that fuck this drain the swamp bullshit.
3274000	3280000	The swamp is in Washington. You need to throw out the garbage. He was just repeating stuff that he thought people would like to see.
3280000	3288000	Throw out the fucking garbage. Anyway, I totally appreciate that. J.D. in chat says, Rob, run in your local district.
3288000	3294000	I heart that you think that. And believe me, I've given it thought because and I've told the story on OLR before.
3294000	3303000	But if you are not aware, my ex before I was with Alan, who if you go way, way, way back on this show, you can probably hear on this show at some point.
3303000	3311000	What you may not have known at the time is that my ex was a candidate for state assembly here in California and he damn near won.
3311000	3316000	And we should all be thankful he didn't. In retrospect, I'm going to see this now.
3316000	3323000	He didn't strike me as very smart. But the one thing I learned from that experience, I'm not going to sit here to shade my ex to know.
3323000	3326000	I'll shade him. We go for it. But the one thing not very smart.
3326000	3341000	The one thing I learned from that whole experience, you guys, if this guy can run for office and get more votes than anyone in his party had ever gotten in that district, if that guy can run for office, any fucking idiot can run for office.
3341000	3343000	Just look at the president.
3343000	3353000	Three words that you wouldn't think go together. All two of them could go together. Gay, Asian, Republican.
3353000	3361000	I didn't want to talk about it. All right. Anyway, what else do I want to say about that whole thing? Before, not the ex.
3361000	3368000	Oh, me running for office and why that won't happen. Because, unfortunately, there is too much of my life that's been recorded.
3368000	3375000	Somebody will go back to early episodes of Orange Lounge Radio where we said stupid things because we weren't educated better.
3375000	3378000	Well, that's why we just have to erase it from the internet.
3378000	3382000	Somebody just put you doing Rocky.
3382000	3391000	Yeah, they'll take shit out of context. But the thing is, also with Rocky, I'm not embarrassed about any of that. Rocky gave an outlet to a lot of people, you know?
3391000	3397000	Yeah, but I mean, I'm just saying that it would be something that someone would try to use against you.
3397000	3405000	Somebody will find an early, early, early episode of this show or under station live or something where maybe I said the R word or I said granny chaser, but with a different word.
3405000	3412000	And now I know that that is not okay. Like, you know, I've been educated and that was a long time ago.
3412000	3416000	But that's the disgustingness of politics is that people will dig up old shit.
3416000	3426000	This is the reason why I like the activism that I do. Because the activism that I do, I can be as loud and fucking obnoxious as I need to be.
3426000	3435000	Although I try not to be loud and fucking obnoxious. I try to do things the right way. Activism is just as big a part as running for office.
3435000	3440000	Because you need to get out there and make your voice be heard by the masses.
3440000	3448000	And I don't care if people don't like, oh, this is not gaming. This is political. This all affects your life.
3449000	3458000	And as we can see now, it's going to affect your ability to game, you know, as what we see, you know, potentially happening with this whole net neutrality thing.
3458000	3468000	It's going to be a thing. You've got to, I hate the term woke, but you've got to wake yourself up. You have to go out and be a part of life.
3468000	3472000	I do love these comments in chat. There's a great discussion going on in chat.
3472000	3479000	J.D. says millennials will vote for a Rocky Horror person. That honestly is probably true. You know, that part honestly probably couldn't be held against me as much.
3479000	3482000	I would vote as long as you went into office in a corset.
3482000	3493000	Only with the theme playing. And let's see, Bobby Blackwell points out there was a guy running for office in Florida that got destroyed by the opposition because of the in-character post he made when he was in a vampire LARP.
3493000	3503000	But see, I would look at somebody like that and go like, that person gets me in a way that, you know, curmudgeon-y frumple bump that's running against them doesn't.
3503000	3505000	I'm going to officially change my name to that.
3506000	3508000	I just found Loki's drag name.
3510000	3511000	It fits.
3517000	3518000	Rob's red now.
3518000	3525000	I just pulled that name out of thin air, but it works. It's a perfect drag name for Loki. Curmudgeon-y frumple bump. Is that what I said?
3525000	3526000	Curmudgeon-y frumple bump.
3528000	3529000	Anyway.
3531000	3532000	Rob.
3532000	3534000	I can't. I can't. Alright.
3534000	3536000	Rob had to lean against the wall.
3536000	3545000	I do want to say a Zets comment because it's really good. The thing is you have to own it. Hiding your skeletons is what gets you into trouble. Absolutely. Absolutely.
3545000	3556000	And that's why I say right here, maybe I will run for office someday. If somebody tries to use that old shit against me, I learn every day and I learn to do better every day.
3556000	3560000	And so, yes, you will find stupid shit I said, but it was in 2004.
3560000	3565000	Raginator said Rob Robert's campaign slogan, in just seven days he'll make your district respectable.
3567000	3568000	I like that.
3569000	3573000	Wait, hold on. Hold on, you guys. Did Raginator actually say something funny?
3573000	3574000	Yes.
3575000	3580000	Could we get that in the OLR Wiki, please? It was Sunday, April 8th at 7.05 Pacific.
3580000	3582000	Get to it, dark, dark.
3582000	3588000	It was Sunday, April 8th. Raginator said something funny. Actually funny. Give him a round of applause, everybody.
3594000	3595000	I'm such an asshole.
3595000	3598000	S2100mattinchat says Rob owns all his skeletons.
3598000	3600000	But Rob, are you a bleached asshole?
3600000	3601000	Stop it.
3601000	3607000	S2100mattinchat says Rob owns his skeletons all the time. He says Super Metroid is the best game of all time over Chrono Trigger.
3607000	3610000	You're right, I own it. I said what I said.
3610000	3611000	Everyone can be wrong.
3613000	3615000	All right, anyway, let's move on.
3615000	3618000	Or as the phrase goes, even the clock is correct twice a day.
3618000	3621000	Loki, get us to another story.
3621000	3623000	Comradesome Frumblebump, get us to another story.
3623000	3624000	All right, sounds good.
3624000	3627000	So let's talk a little bit about PUBG.
3627000	3637000	So PUBG and, of course, the company that makes it are going after some of these clones that are online.
3637000	3644000	So one of these, I guess, PUBG Corp is citing, I guess, NetEase because they're using...
3644000	3652000	It's not even necessarily that they're outright copying PUBG, like putting it up there, you know, just changing the name or something like that.
3652000	3659000	But basically because they use the word chicken dinner in their marketing and they have their similarities in...
3659000	3661000	Are they gonna sue KFC?
3663000	3669000	And they have similarities in... They have buildings and landscapes and vehicles and weapons and clothes and stuff like that.
3669000	3675000	And then also they were going after another company because they used a frying pan as a weapon in there.
3676000	3677000	Dude.
3677000	3680000	Wasn't a frying pan a weapon in Final Fantasy IV?
3680000	3687000	Well, a frying pan was a weapon in Left 4 Dead 2. I think one of the Silent Hill games had a frying pan as a weapon.
3687000	3689000	Frying pans have a history of being used as weapons.
3689000	3692000	Exactly. And should we go back to like...
3692000	3693000	Dragonlance books.
3693000	3697000	Like movies and stuff like that have used frying pans as weapons.
3697000	3702000	So basically, I remember PUBG Corp was also one to like,
3702000	3705000	Why don't we share that Fortnite's doing better than our game?
3705000	3707000	They're copiers.
3707000	3709000	Okay, Waluigi.
3709000	3712000	Seriously, they just bitch in moments.
3712000	3718000	It seems like they don't have much of an argument.
3718000	3724000	They need to get out of the mindset of a patent troll.
3724000	3726000	They need to get out of the patent troll mindset.
3726000	3730000	Well, you can't trademark aspects of a game like this.
3730000	3732000	You can't trademark frying pan.
3732000	3735000	You can't trademark a frying pan because a frying pan is a fucking frying pan.
3735000	3737000	Our chat room is lighting up.
3737000	3740000	JD says Princess Peach uses a frying pan as a weapon.
3740000	3743000	Sia Tabiri asks, are they going to sue Trixie Mattel?
3743000	3746000	Winner, winner. Chicken dinner.
3746000	3749000	That phrase has been around for fucking ever.
3749000	3752000	I know it certainly is in Fortnite.
3752000	3755000	I remember reading the Dragonlance books ages ago,
3755000	3759000	and one of the characters, her primary weapons were a pot lid and a frying pan.
3759000	3762000	Tigerclaw in chat says, why not a steak dinner?
3762000	3764000	Steak dinner is better than chicken dinner.
3764000	3767000	I actually agree with Tigerclaw a lot on this.
3767000	3769000	Steak dinner is better than a chicken dinner.
3769000	3773000	Winner, winner. Ruth Chris gift card.
3773000	3775000	That's the game I play.
3775000	3778000	That doesn't rhyme.
3778000	3781000	Brad from Pop Culture says they're going to sue Cooking Mama.
3781000	3784000	You guys are on fire with the jokes tonight. What's up with this?
3784000	3786000	We've got some sassy bitches in the chat.
3786000	3789000	Y'all drank a load of sass before tonight's show.
3789000	3792000	You should think of new catchphrases they could use
3792000	3795000	in place of winner, winner, chicken dinner.
3795000	3797000	Oh, maybe that should be a list list.
3797000	3802000	Oh, here I know. We could just say, I want my baby back, Rizzer.
3802000	3805000	Or, I feel like chicken tonight, or I don't know.
3805000	3806000	Loser, loser.
3806000	3808000	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
3808000	3811000	Loser, loser. You starve.
3811000	3815000	It was shake and bake, and I helped.
3815000	3818000	It's stupid. It's dumb.
3818000	3822000	It screams of desperation because, I don't know,
3822000	3827000	because they're blaming everybody but themselves for the game,
3827000	3830000	not doing as well as their competition.
3830000	3834000	Honestly, their competition, they took the formula that they have,
3834000	3836000	which is almost like a genre now,
3836000	3839000	and just kind of made it different and better.
3839000	3843000	Sorry, you can cry about it all you want,
3843000	3846000	but I don't think you have really the leg to stand on,
3846000	3848000	the legal leg to stand on for suing these people,
3848000	3851000	or trying to file a lawsuit against them.
3851000	3852000	Sorry.
3852000	3853000	Good luck with that.
3853000	3855000	I'm laughing because the chat room, Sia Tabiri goes,
3855000	3858000	where's the beef?
3858000	3865000	It's my favorite one so far for a replacement wine.
3865000	3867000	Pardon me, do you have any grape upon?
3867000	3869000	Jesus, you guys are on fire tonight.
3869000	3871000	SSG100Matt says, you know what?
3871000	3873000	Competition keeps people from resting on their laurels.
3873000	3876000	They should embrace it and keep one-upping each other with innovation.
3876000	3877000	This.
3877000	3878000	Exactly.
3878000	3880000	They put out some more maps for the game
3880000	3882000	that just haven't really been released everywhere yet,
3882000	3887000	so I know they've got some new maps that are supposed to get things more interesting,
3887000	3892000	but yeah, you can't just, don't be like king, okay?
3892000	3897000	Don't be like king and start suing people for using the word candy or saga.
3897000	3899000	It's ridiculous.
3899000	3902000	I can't believe nobody for a jingle for winning one of these one versus 100 games
3902000	3907000	has said, a Mr. Bucket, a Mr. Bucket.
3907000	3909000	All right, anyway.
3909000	3912000	Let's move on to another story that talks about,
3912000	3915000	can you play PUBG on Linux?
3915000	3916000	Does that game exist on Linux?
3916000	3917000	What about Fortnite?
3917000	3918000	Are these games on Linux?
3918000	3921000	I don't know because maybe.
3921000	3924000	I mean, they have the mobile versions run on Android and stuff,
3924000	3926000	so maybe they have a Linux version.
3926000	3930000	From Ragenator, Wiener Wiener, Oscar Mayer dinner.
3930000	3931000	That's pretty good.
3931000	3932000	That's pretty good.
3932000	3934000	Anyway, so here's the thing.
3934000	3936000	I want to talk a little bit about steam machines
3936000	3941000	because if you weren't aware, steam machines kind of came and went.
3941000	3943000	Like, well, they're not gone, but.
3943000	3944000	But they weren't popular?
3944000	3946000	Yeah, they just, they didn't really get adopted,
3946000	3950000	and this was noted that, oh, Valve is no longer highlighting these steam machine hardwares
3950000	3952000	on the front page of the Steam store,
3952000	3954000	and this is saying, oh, this is the end.
3954000	3955000	They're gone.
3955000	3958000	Although, Valve employee Pierre Lou Griffiths,
3958000	3959000	because nobody has a title there,
3959000	3961000	so I'm sorry if I butchered this guy's name,
3961000	3964000	but he said in a post to a steam community that the steam machine link
3964000	3968000	on the Steam store front page was removed based on user traffic.
3968000	3971000	He did acknowledge, steam machines aren't exactly flying off the shelves,
3971000	3975000	but our reasons for striving towards a competitive and open gaming platform
3975000	3977000	haven't significantly changed.
3977000	3980000	Valve learned quite a bit about the state of the Linux ecosystem
3980000	3982000	for real world game developers out there.
3982000	3984000	We've taken a lot of feedback and have been heads down
3984000	3986000	on addressing the shortcomings we've observed,
3986000	3989000	and also went on to highlight that Valve is continuing to work
3989000	3992000	on the Vulkan graphics standard.
3992000	3994000	That does support Mac and Linux,
3994000	3996000	and that's all in part to the company's effort.
3996000	3998000	We have other Linux initiatives in the pipe
3998000	4000000	that we're not quite ready to talk about.
4000000	4003000	SteamOS will continue to be our medium to deliver these improvements to our customers,
4003000	4006000	and we think they will ultimately benefit the Linux ecosystem at large.
4006000	4008000	When are they going to put out a new source engine?
4008000	4011000	When are they going to put out a game?
4011000	4012000	Anything.
4012000	4013000	Anything.
4014000	4016000	What was the last game?
4016000	4017000	Dota 2.
4017000	4019000	Actually, probably VR games.
4019000	4021000	Now I think HTC Vive.
4021000	4023000	Didn't they have a card game or something?
4023000	4025000	Dota had a card game, yes.
4025000	4026000	Yeah, the Dota card game.
4026000	4030000	But I think to be fair, some of the HTC Vive experiences
4030000	4032000	were where some of the resources was going lately.
4032000	4038000	So I just, like many of you, would just like to see Valve do literally anything.
4038000	4040000	I just miss the old Valve, where they put out games.
4040000	4041000	Yes.
4042000	4043000	Semi-regularly.
4043000	4046000	Bobby Blackwell, I knew he would be on top of his VR stuff.
4046000	4049000	Bobby Blackwell says the Lab was the last Valve game.
4049000	4051000	That was more of a minigame.
4051000	4053000	Maybe a couple years ago.
4053000	4057000	In gaming terms, it was ages ago, yes.
4057000	4061000	So, Steam Machines didn't quite take off.
4061000	4063000	Does this surprise you guys, or no?
4063000	4064000	Why?
4064000	4067000	No, it doesn't surprise me, because small form factor PCs,
4067000	4072000	they're just hard to, it's hard to make a really small form factor.
4072000	4076000	And honestly, I think if you're going to game on a TV or something like that,
4076000	4080000	it doesn't have to be that small of a case, just make it look nice.
4080000	4082000	I mean, that's really it.
4082000	4085000	They have cases that are fucking huge, but it's all about thermals and shit.
4085000	4088000	And also something like that, you want to be able to make sure that it's upgradeable,
4088000	4090000	because it is a PC after all.
4090000	4094000	It was hard, I think what it was is they were trying to compete with consoles.
4094000	4099000	And the cost of consoles is so low now, it's hard to make a PC that, you know,
4099000	4102000	is going to be competitive price-wise.
4102000	4106000	DarkSagro, do you have an opinion on the Steam Boxes or Steam Machines
4106000	4109000	and why they didn't do so well?
4109000	4110000	Not really.
4110000	4116000	I mean, people, if they want a console, they'll get a console.
4116000	4118000	You know, I just...
4118000	4120000	Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at with this too.
4120000	4125000	I don't think Valve ever really said, not that it's said,
4125000	4127000	but I don't think Valve found the audience for this.
4127000	4131000	Like, Valve never really figured out who's the audience for these boxes,
4131000	4135000	because I feel like most people that want to do PC gaming have a PC.
4135000	4138000	Most people that want to play on their TV have a console.
4138000	4141000	So where does this fit in? Is it supposed to compete with consoles?
4141000	4144000	Well, I would assume Microsoft and a lot of stuff that they're doing
4144000	4146000	kind of cock-blocked them in that regard,
4146000	4150000	because Microsoft's kind of been pushing with their console and the PC space
4150000	4153000	and trying to unify that, and I think this is a case where maybe
4153000	4156000	Microsoft kind of has pulled that off a little better than Steam.
4156000	4158000	I was only using my Steam Link.
4158000	4160000	Yeah, I have a Steam Link and I haven't used it yet.
4160000	4163000	I mean, we used our old one once and then returned it,
4163000	4166000	and I actually needed to ask you how you had your setup
4166000	4168000	that you don't get any latency, so...
4168000	4172000	Because it's wired. I use that gigantic wire and I plug it into the Steam Link.
4172000	4173000	That's how I don't get latency.
4173000	4174000	Okay.
4174000	4175000	Yep.
4176000	4180000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
4180000	4184000	at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, battery.
4184000	4186000	Bobby Blackwell says,
4186000	4188000	Steam Link is better for playing PC games on a TV
4188000	4191000	than getting a Steam machine, or rather, cheaper.
4191000	4194000	And yeah, they are, man, I paid like 50 bucks for one,
4194000	4198000	and Fantaz says, I bought a Steam Link for four bucks on Black Friday.
4198000	4200000	Got it for a dollar.
4200000	4202000	Yeah, that's how I got mine.
4202000	4205000	A lot of them, they're giving them away with different game purchases,
4205000	4207000	so keep an eye out for those wonderful sales.
4207000	4210000	Man, that makes me mad. Alright, let's move on.
4210000	4212000	Another subject, Dark Sakura.
4212000	4217000	Well, there are games that are now, again, banned in China,
4217000	4219000	but they're taking it a step further.
4219000	4227000	So basically, what happened is that there was a scene in,
4227000	4229000	I think it was Call of Duty Black Ops 2,
4229000	4231000	where you could drop a bomb in Tiananmen Square,
4231000	4236000	and so the Chinese government pretty much, you know,
4236000	4243000	did this big crackdown so that they would, I guess, ban the game again,
4243000	4247000	but they're also now putting in surveillance in Internet cafes
4247000	4251000	to keep people from buying them and from playing the games.
4251000	4255000	They're actually trying to stop all playing of banned games.
4255000	4259000	Some of the other ones were Red Alert 2,
4259000	4264000	Glory of the Republic, where you could fight against the People's Liberation Army.
4264000	4270000	There's just a big list of games, but there's more than 5,000 Internet cafes
4270000	4275000	now have to have a government surveillance system on all the computers.
4275000	4280000	So one of the players is saying is that every time they play,
4280000	4283000	there's this message that pops up to warn them
4283000	4287000	and that it's really just removed a lot of the fun from playing, of course.
4287000	4291000	But anyway, the way it's going to work is that any official will be notified
4291000	4294000	if users are playing banned games in the cafes.
4298000	4302000	I guess there could always be worse laws than leaving net neutrality behind,
4302000	4306000	but I'm kind of not surprised to hear that particular topic,
4306000	4310000	the Tiananmen Square thing, is a very sensitive thing to the Chinese government
4310000	4316000	for obvious reasons, things that they're not exactly wanting their people to really know about.
4316000	4318000	We're heading that way, though.
4318000	4323000	Well, we need to embrace and remember that in this country.
4323000	4328000	We're able to share these types of things openly, at least the way things are now.
4328000	4333000	I don't really think some of those fundamental American things are really ever going to go away,
4333000	4336000	but that we're able to have that freedom of speech to be able to talk about it.
4336000	4339000	To have this fucking show, honestly, and say whatever we want,
4339000	4343000	we have to be thankful that we have that ability because not everybody in the world does.
4343000	4350000	As pissed off as we get sometimes, the way things are, there are some pretty rad things about being an American.
4350000	4354000	And the right to get pissed off about it is one of them.
4354000	4359000	Anyway, let's move on. Loki, just a couple more stories before we get to the Classic Game of the Week.
4359000	4365000	This is kind of cool news. There was an announcement about Jackbox Party Pack 5,
4365000	4370000	and one of the games that's going to be among that is You Don't Know Jack.
4370000	4376000	They have this fictional company, I guess, that's kind of like the overlay for the whole thing,
4376000	4381000	this binge pipe or something like that, and it's this kind of...
4381000	4382000	Buzzfeed type of thing.
4382000	4388000	Yeah, a parody of all the streaming services out there and content and social media and stuff like that.
4388000	4393000	So it's interesting. I don't know what other games are supposed to be in there as well.
4393000	4396000	They haven't announced those yet. They'll trickle that out over the coming months.
4397000	4401000	But that sounds cool that there's going to be a whole new You Don't Know Jack games.
4401000	4404000	Yeah, I forgot to mention in my gaming league. That was the game I was trying to think of that I forgot.
4404000	4412000	But on Friday, I actually did a Jackbox stream. I guessed it on CI Live's Con Improv, which our old friend of the show,
4412000	4415000	he used to go by DMN. He doesn't go by that anymore, but that's what he was back in the day.
4415000	4421000	But Jon works a lot with this group, the Con Improv group, and so they had me on their stream on Friday night doing
4421000	4424000	Sorry, not You Don't Know Jack, but the Jackbox Party Pack.
4424000	4429000	And that was fun because somehow some of those games I just had never gotten around to playing.
4429000	4433000	Although I have all the Jackbox Party Packs, I guess I just never really had the people to play some of them.
4433000	4437000	So we played that bracketeering, and we actually had 16 people in the game, and that was a lot of fun.
4437000	4440000	And I actually won one of them.
4440000	4444000	The bracket was, because it just keeps going like these against these against these.
4444000	4446000	You just keep kind of voting on answers.
4446000	4454000	And the bracket was Best Name for a CPR Dummy, and I said Dummy McDummy Face, and I won.
4456000	4458000	So there you go. But anyway.
4458000	4460000	So yeah, the Jackbox games are fun.
4460000	4464000	And they've always been, they've come on the show a couple times here at ORR.
4464000	4466000	I think we know people over there that actually listen to the show.
4466000	4470000	So hi guys, and good luck with You Don't Know Jack and Jackbox Party Pack 5.
4470000	4474000	I'm sure tons of people are gonna buy it because these games are great party games.
4474000	4477000	They're great, like, you know, let's come together and do this.
4477000	4483000	One thing I do want to call out though, you know, in the interest of fairness, even though I'm big fans of Jackbox.
4483000	4488000	They have made this whole, like, You Don't Know Jack is going to use mobile phones.
4488000	4490000	And they've really stood by that.
4490000	4496000	Because one place where the last version of You Don't Know Jack, I think in the first Party Pack, if I remember right, first or second, I think the first one.
4496000	4503000	Where that one got a little bit of, you know, kind of criticism was that because people were using their phones to buzz in,
4503000	4505000	it wasn't exactly accurate.
4505000	4510000	And you couldn't really use a controller, like you couldn't plug in a bunch of controllers and have people buzz in on the controller.
4510000	4517000	Like when You Don't Know Jack was, you know, on the PC and stuff where you had something more tangible and wired to buzz in on.
4517000	4521000	And so I thought it was interesting in some of the, you know, FAQs on this.
4521000	4526000	They basically said, yeah, we've heard that feedback and we're basically not going to implement it.
4526000	4534000	But to be fair to them, they have said that they are building this one with the mobile phone stuff in mind.
4534000	4537000	So this is being built for the mobile phones.
4537000	4544000	So I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt because, you know, especially I kind of thought we weren't going to see You Don't Know Jack again.
4544000	4549000	Because I kind of thought Trivia Murder Party was their new, like, You Don't Know Jack.
4549000	4551000	And that game does work very well.
4551000	4552000	It is pretty awesome.
4552000	4554000	And that game was built for mobile phones from the ground up.
4554000	4559000	So with that in mind, knowing that Trivia Murder Party worked out really well.
4559000	4565000	That's why I'm kind of having an open mind with letting them do You Don't Know Jack again even though they're not going to go back to a tangible controller for it.
4565000	4567000	So we'll see what happens. I'm very curious.
4567000	4570000	So let's see.
4570000	4577000	Bobby said, oh, it was in the VOG Network review because he wrote it because he didn't have them on his show.
4577000	4585000	And said, you need a controller support, but then agrees that my friends only want to play Trivia Murder Party.
4585000	4592000	Well, too bad they couldn't, like, come up with a better way to, like, basically capture when someone buzzes in, like, you know, grabbing.
4592000	4599000	I know it's hard to grab server time sometimes, but maybe just grabbing the server time every so often and then calculating it also with your phone time.
4599000	4600000	Right.
4600000	4605000	So you kind of get a timestamp and then that way any latency that's in there, just reading timestamps.
4605000	4613000	So that way you shouldn't latency shouldn't be a problem. It's just me taking a sec for it to clue that you're, you know, say that you buzzed in.
4613000	4620000	I honestly wonder if in the new You Don't Know Jack game, they're just going to get rid of buzzing in because that's what they did in Trivia Murder Party.
4620000	4622000	You don't buzz in. Everybody answers the question.
4622000	4627000	And those who get it wrong basically, you know, go to the death game or whatever, that whole thing.
4627000	4628000	Right.
4628000	4636000	So, I mean, what if that's their solution is that the new You Don't Know Jack game, they're just going to get rid of buzzing in.
4636000	4641000	It'll be interesting, but again, because I like Trivia Murder Party so much and the other Jackbox games, too.
4641000	4645000	I know I keep talking about that one, but that one's the most adjacent to You Don't Know Jack and what it does.
4645000	4647000	I think the new You Don't Know Jack will turn out just fine.
4647000	4649000	So we'll see.
4649000	4650000	Good luck to those guys.
4650000	4651000	Look forward to it.
4651000	4655000	And hey, if you want to come on to OLR and talk about it, maybe drop an exclusive or two.
4655000	4656000	Love to have you.
4656000	4659000	All right, one more story before we get to the classic game of the week.
4659000	4662000	And this has to do with, this is really cool.
4662000	4664000	Actually, this is a classic all in its own.
4664000	4668000	And a lot of the games that will be included in this could very well be classic games of the week.
4668000	4677000	SNK has revealed at PAX East in a panel that they are releasing a 40th anniversary collection for the Nintendo Switch.
4677000	4680000	And this is going to include games that are upscaled to 1080p.
4680000	4685000	Now, even though this is SNK, this is not Neo Geo stuff.
4685000	4688000	This is stuff that they made before Neo Geo was a thing.
4688000	4693000	So this compilation includes games that will be released on the Nintendo Switch in Fall 2018.
4693000	4698000	It includes things like Athena, both arcade and home versions.
4698000	4701000	Alpha Mission, home and arcade versions.
4701000	4702000	Akari Warriors.
4702000	4703000	Fuck yes.
4703000	4704000	Akari Warriors 3.
4704000	4707000	What was the name of the second Akari Warriors game?
4707000	4708000	It's in there too.
4708000	4714000	Gorilla War, P.O.W., Psycho Soldier, Street Smart, T.N.K.3, Vanguard.
4714000	4716000	Oh, Victory Road. That was Akari Warriors 2.
4716000	4721000	Psycho Soldier and, last but not least, Crystallis.
4721000	4724000	Which is an amazing NES RPG.
4724000	4726000	I can't believe there was never a second one.
4726000	4728000	Or was there? Am I missing something in our soccer?
4728000	4730000	Did they try to do like a second Crystallis on Neo Geo or something?
4730000	4731000	I don't remember.
4731000	4732000	I don't think they did. I think Crystallis...
4732000	4735000	I know there was a Game Boy release at some point, but that was just the original game.
4736000	4740000	So I think, yeah, they just didn't ever visit that series again.
4740000	4744000	Oh yeah, Crystallis was remade for Game Boy Color with a bonus boss. That was it.
4744000	4745000	I do remember that.
4745000	4753000	Anyway, with this collection, there will be a limited edition version of this with a book and a soundtrack CD.
4753000	4755000	So that's all coming out Fall 2018.
4755000	4757000	That's awesome. I'm definitely going to pick that up.
4757000	4759000	Shit, for Crystallis alone, probably.
4759000	4761000	But all those other games are really good too.
4761000	4765000	I actually, I remember playing Athena on the NES and I didn't hate it as much as everyone else did.
4765000	4767000	Although it was a little bit wonky.
4767000	4769000	But Ikaria Warriors, all those games are great.
4769000	4771000	This does beg the question though.
4771000	4775000	Why wouldn't they just release these on Virtual Console?
4775000	4779000	Now, yes, I know, LOL, Nintendo Virtual Console.
4779000	4783000	But surely, they would have just kept these in the hopper to release.
4783000	4787000	Like Crystallis, they would have just released on Virtual Console at some point, right?
4787000	4790000	Or what's going on there?
4791000	4793000	We won't know until September.
4793000	4794000	I suppose.
4794000	4796000	If it ends up being September.
4796000	4802000	I did notice though, like I bought, because I mentioned one of my friends, their daughter had a birthday.
4802000	4805000	So I don't know how to shop for girls.
4805000	4808000	So I know they had a Nintendo Switch, so I bought her a Switch game.
4808000	4812000	Bought her Scribblenauts, the new one.
4812000	4814000	I don't remember what it is.
4814000	4816000	Some party game, Scribblenauts party game.
4816000	4820000	Anyways, but it did mention something on the back.
4820000	4824000	That there may be a fee for online service or something like that.
4824000	4826000	So they have that already in play.
4826000	4829000	That they're going to charge something for it later on.
4829000	4832000	Just when that later on is going to be.
4833000	4839000	Alright, well, maybe finally we'll have some Virtual Console answers at E3 this year.
4839000	4843000	But I'm really at the point where I'm like, I'm just not going to hold my breath anymore.
4843000	4844000	It'll happen when it happens.
4844000	4845000	Maybe never.
4845000	4848000	It's disappointing. I think it's money left on the table for them.
4848000	4851000	I do too, but it's their choice.
4851000	4853000	Because they seem to be making a lot of money anyway.
4853000	4855000	Anyway, let's take a trip down memory lane.
4855000	4859000	Every week Dark Sakura opens the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
4859000	4862000	Hey, you brats, you should be paying attention to this.
4862000	4866000	But, in a twist for the year 2018, once a month she says,
4866000	4870000	Hey, why don't you use this peripheral to play a game?
4870000	4873000	It's Dark Sakura's classic peripheral of the month.
4873000	4874000	Or, what?
4874000	4876000	Say it with me. Peripheral.
4876000	4878000	Peripheral. I just...
4878000	4879000	It's your piscetti.
4879000	4883000	You learn to say things one way and it's tomato, tomato, it's ingrained in your brain.
4883000	4886000	Anyway, or as my dad always said, ammons.
4886000	4887000	And that's the one that messes with me.
4887000	4888000	Ew.
4888000	4889000	Yeah, I know, right? Anyway.
4889000	4892000	But in this case it's peripherals of the month.
4892000	4894000	Yes, well, because they're technically the same thing.
4894000	4895000	Alright, so here it is.
4895000	4897000	For the same reason.
4897000	4898000	What did you pick, Dark Sakura?
4898000	4900000	I picked the twin sticks.
4901000	4905000	Specifically starting with the Saturn twin stick and then the Dreamcast twin stick.
4905000	4909000	Which were both released simply for one game each.
4909000	4916000	The Saturn twin stick was a peripheral designed to be used on Cybertroopers Virtual On.
4916000	4923000	So it is two joysticks that have fewer buttons but each of them have a button on top.
4923000	4931000	And it's set up, at least the Saturn twin stick is meant to look like the same style as a Virtual On panel.
4931000	4936000	It was only sold with the pack that contained Virtual On.
4936000	4940000	Although the twin sticks did have it's own product code.
4940000	4949000	It was released only in Japan even though there was an English and European manual.
4949000	4954000	And it led to then the creation of the Dreamcast twin stick.
4954000	4959000	In Japan it was released on November 29th, 1996.
4959000	4965000	And retailed for 5,800 yen, so roughly 50 something bucks.
4965000	4970000	I sadly do not have a whole lot about the specifics of this.
4970000	4974000	But I can tell you that they're fucking fun to play with.
4974000	4980000	Now this goes on, I'm actually to this day still wanting a pair of Saturn twin sticks.
4980000	4984000	But now I'll go to something that I do own, the Dreamcast twin stick.
4984000	4989000	Which was released to be used with Cybertroopers Virtual On or Atario Tangrum.
4989000	4997000	And it is exactly just like the Saturn twin stick except it's that plain grey and white Dreamcast with orange buttons on it.
4997000	5001000	It does have a VMU slot and it only released in Japan.
5001000	5004000	It's release date was December 9th, 1999.
5004000	5012000	And it also, even though it came out years later, it also retailed for the same price, 5,800 yen.
5015000	5019000	You can play Virtual On with a controller.
5019000	5026000	But there's just something different about playing it with the twin sticks that make the game so much more immersive and so much more fun to play.
5026000	5030000	And we had a lot of time spent on Atario Tangrum.
5030000	5036000	Rob, do you remember Game Masters that used to be on Greenback?
5036000	5037000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5037000	5039000	That's where we got our twin sticks from.
5039000	5040000	Oh, funny.
5040000	5042000	That's where we got our Japanese Dreamcast.
5042000	5047000	So, we just had so much fun with Virtual On and I love fucking Virtual On.
5047000	5049000	Which I've done for Classic Game before.
5049000	5052000	You can't mention Virtual On without eventually bringing up the twin sticks.
5052000	5057000	So, I've never played on any game other than Virtual On.
5057000	5059000	So, I do not know if it's compatible.
5059000	5064000	But, hey, it's fucking fun and it's my peripheral of the week.
5064000	5066000	Alright, there you go.
5066000	5068000	The twin sticks.
5068000	5070000	Twins, because there's two of them.
5070000	5074000	And plus, that music in the background is the best music in Virtual On.
5074000	5077000	It was really just an excuse for you to play Virtual On music here on the show, wasn't it?
5077000	5078000	Kind of, sort of.
5078000	5080000	That's alright, I totally support that.
5080000	5082000	Anyway, we are going to take a quick break.
5082000	5084000	We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5084000	5086000	Including your calls, Orange Lounge Radio.
5086000	5089000	All one word on Skype if you want to give us a call a little later.
5089000	5092000	And we're going to get as well some rapid fire news and some more stories.
5092000	5094000	Sadly, no mailbag tonight it looks like though.
5094000	5096000	At least when I looked before the show there wasn't anything there.
5096000	5097000	So, I don't know.
5097000	5098000	I haven't checked yet.
5098000	5100000	Yeah, but just don't forget to send us emails in the future.
5100000	5102000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5102000	5106000	So, we've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come when we come back.
5111000	5114000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5114000	5119000	We're back live tonight with episode number 725 of our show, already in progress.
5119000	5124000	And thank you guys, of course, as always for tuning in and spending your Sunday nights with us.
5124000	5128000	Or, whatever time throughout the week you're setting aside to listen to this podcast.
5128000	5130000	We do really appreciate it, of course.
5130000	5135000	Before we get into some rapid fire news tonight, I have some late breaking news.
5135000	5143000	And, unfortunately, this is another one of those, like, Lord Face Palm type of stories.
5143000	5146000	Overwatch League just suspended another player.
5146000	5153000	This time the Boston Uprising has suspended Dream Casper, was the name of the guy, following.
5153000	5162000	He's 21 and this follows allegations he pursued a romantic and potentially sexual relationship with someone believed to be a 14 or 15 year old girl.
5163000	5165000	In a tweet, the Boston Uprising said,
5165000	5173000	We take all allegations of this nature very seriously and as a result, Dream Casper has been suspended from the Boston Uprising indefinitely.
5173000	5178000	The Overwatch League also putting out a tweet that they are aware of the situation as well.
5178000	5187000	Dream Casper, one of the best Western DPS players in the league, who was unknown prior to the league debut and will no doubt slip right back into obscurity after this.
5187000	5194000	That, by the way, for those keeping score at home, is the sixth player suspended by the Overwatch League for some sort of shitty behavior since it's begun.
5194000	5199000	Look, I've talked a lot at length about the Overwatch League here on the program.
5199000	5205000	I like that at least little baby steps, you know, they finally got a woman on the league, which is one.
5205000	5208000	We got a token, but we can do a little bit better in that regard.
5208000	5215000	And I think, you know, as we're starting to see the Overwatch League really kind of push esports to the next level.
5215000	5218000	Like, you know, ESPN ran this story I just read to you guys.
5218000	5221000	So, you know, esports is becoming more and more mainstream.
5221000	5227000	I just, I have a feeling, you know, I'm not going to try to blame Overwatch League for the shitty behavior.
5227000	5233000	You know, shitty people are going to do shitty things and I'm not sure Overwatch League, I'm not sure what they could have done to prevent it.
5233000	5238000	It's just, you know, their response is swift and mighty and that's what they have to do.
5238000	5244000	But my whole thing is just like, we're going to really see, you know, as the spotlight gets put on some of these people,
5244000	5249000	we're going to really see some behaviors just kind of like, you know, I guess it's like Jamie has said before, taking out the trash.
5249000	5253000	And unfortunately Overwatch League's had a little bit of it.
5253000	5263000	But hopefully they will, hopefully they will just do better in some of their recruitment so far for Season 2.
5263000	5269000	Alan Alchemy in chat, in all caps, mind you, says,
5269000	5275000	These dudes get paid thousands between Patreons, Twitch partnerships, and gaming equipment sponsorships to play video games.
5275000	5282000	Literally all that is asked of them is to not be racist, homophobic, or date rape, and they can't do it.
5284000	5289000	JD in chat says, Here's the thing, a lot of professional athletes have a problem being decent people.
5290000	5296000	Whatever, congratulations gaming, you've arrived. Your athletes are just as overpaid to be awful people as mainstream culture.
5296000	5301000	Azet in chat says, But I'm famous and popular and can do anything. What are consequences?
5301000	5309000	So that's why I said, you know, I will give Overwatch League credit for bringing down the Swift hammer of justice swiftly.
5309000	5317000	Anyhow, let's move on to something a little more positive and some rapid fire news and some things to look forward to in gaming. Loki.
5317000	5326000	Alright, so Chrono Trigger, we talked about the PC port, that was kind of meh, not great.
5326000	5335000	People didn't like what they kind of did to the graphics of the game. However, with that, they've been, apparently Square Enix has been working to address issues.
5335000	5341000	And one of the patches that they will be releasing will be a patch that includes the original graphics for the game.
5341000	5349000	So at least that's something. No word on when that is exactly going to, you know, make it there.
5349000	5351000	So you can turn the filter on and off.
5351000	5352000	Yes.
5352000	5359000	Or what they're doing is they're quickly making another, but they're not going to tell you it's another filter, it's just the regular graphics.
5359000	5360000	Probably.
5360000	5361000	Yeah. Anyway.
5361000	5368000	So. And then this was something that I saw kind of in my feeds because I do follow Angry Joe a bit.
5368000	5380000	But if you're not aware, he worked on this along with some other people to do a Street Fighter tabletop strategy game, it looks like.
5380000	5384000	And so basically it's got a miniatures game, I guess would be the best way to describe it.
5384000	5389000	So it's a Street Fighter miniatures game and the miniatures look pretty fucking awesome.
5390000	5393000	It was on Kickstarter, got funded in a day.
5393000	5397000	But if you are interested in it, you can check it out on Kickstarter.
5397000	5400000	So just look for Street Fighter, the miniatures game.
5400000	5402000	And yeah, it's pretty awesome looking.
5402000	5406000	I mean, just these would totally be awesome amiibos.
5406000	5408000	I mean, I don't know.
5408000	5410000	I'm not really interested in a ton of miniatures games.
5410000	5414000	It's been a while since I was in the miniatures scene, but it looks cool.
5414000	5418000	Fantasmchat says Angry Joe was at PAX, which doesn't surprise me.
5418000	5420000	PAX is a pretty strong board game community.
5420000	5424000	Didn't they do the PAX Unplugged? Didn't that happen this year in Pennsylvania somewhere?
5424000	5425000	I don't remember.
5425000	5426000	Philly or something. Anyway.
5426000	5432000	I remember being a kid though and having like the Street Fighter RPG game that I think was done by White Wolf.
5432000	5435000	Yes, funny enough, Bobby Black Wolf. I was just about to read that. You're right.
5435000	5438000	There was a pen and paper Street Fighter game in the 90s.
5438000	5441000	It was by the same people who made Vampire, Werewolf, and Mage games.
5441000	5444000	I interviewed the dude who designed it, so you can see that on a previous episode.
5444000	5447000	I didn't even look in the chat, but I had it.
5447000	5449000	Yeah, I remember that too actually.
5449000	5451000	Some of the cool stuff they have in there.
5451000	5454000	So they have like destructible environment pieces and stuff.
5454000	5459000	And each of the play mats or whatever you can do like different stages from the games.
5459000	5464000	So they have like Guile's stage and I know they have like the dojo and stuff.
5464000	5466000	Hopefully you can play music.
5466000	5468000	But can you say, oh my car?
5469000	5471000	I don't know.
5471000	5476000	But yeah, with the game I know that they have like six core miniatures that come with it.
5476000	5481000	So Ryuken, Chun-Li, Zangief, Vega, and Sagat.
5481000	5484000	And then they're going to have an expansion with Bison and Akuma.
5484000	5491000	And then I know some of the stretch goals were different characters from other games.
5491000	5494000	So like the Alpha series and that kind of stuff.
5494000	5497000	So yeah, I mean, it looks cool.
5497000	5501000	It looks pretty high quality. Hope it works out and gets released.
5501000	5505000	So Kickstarter is always very wary.
5505000	5507000	I understand.
5507000	5510000	Alright, well let's talk about original Xbox.
5510000	5515000	Not the 360, not the Xbox One, but I mean like the Xbox First.
5515000	5517000	Direct Xbox, going way back.
5517000	5520000	Some news for the original Xbox.
5520000	5525000	Targeted to come out April 10th at 3.30 Pacific, 6.30 Eastern.
5525000	5527000	So maybe by the time some of you have heard this.
5527000	5532000	And it's going to be a backwards compatibility for these games on the Xbox One.
5532000	5534000	Now there already has been a little bit.
5534000	5538000	But we're going to hear about the next wave of this on the next Inside Xbox.
5538000	5541000	Because right now there's only 13 games that are supported by the service.
5541000	5545000	So Microsoft said in a recent Xbox news post,
5545000	5549000	one of our most common requests is for original Xbox backward compatibility news.
5549000	5553000	And we'll be starting off the show with a big update on just that.
5553000	5557000	What? People want backwards compatibility?
5557000	5559000	That's totally news to Sony.
5559000	5563000	Make sure more people watch that than have watched anything before.
5563000	5567000	Because that's apparently the only way that Sony is going to get some of the information.
5567000	5570000	I've lost hope in Sony, let's be honest.
5570000	5573000	Yeah. Anyway, shoot, this next website is not loading for me.
5573000	5575000	I don't know if this is something that you can pull up.
5575000	5577000	Oh my god, the backwards compatibility is not working on the website.
5577000	5581000	I know. Gosh. But anyway, I do remember it was something to do with the SNK heroines.
5581000	5587000	The tag team frenzy is coming out on the Switch on September 7th in North America and Europe.
5587000	5591000	And I thought this was cool. They're adding Shermie as a character in the game.
5591000	5593000	And it made me think of Dark Sakura's former kitty.
5593000	5595000	Is that where the name came from?
5595000	5598000	That is indeed where my cat's name came from.
5598000	5600000	When I saw that I instantly thought of you.
5600000	5604000	It did work on mine because my PC is beyond Windows XP.
5604000	5606000	It's not on Windows XP.
5606000	5611000	It is coming out digitally on PlayStation 4 September 7th in Europe as well.
5611000	5613000	In North America and Europe.
5613000	5616000	And they're going to have Shermie as a playable character.
5616000	5619000	And she debuted in Kingdom Fighters 97.
5619000	5621000	And it looks neat.
5621000	5625000	Alright, thank you for the pinch hitting there with the correction on the platforms it's coming out for.
5625000	5627000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
5628000	5636000	Well, Konami has purchased a domain name recently for Goemon.
5636000	5638000	So Goemon.com has been purchased.
5638000	5642000	They haven't done anything with it yet.
5642000	5648000	But maybe there will be a new Goemon game on Switch? Maybe? We'll see.
5648000	5653000	Well, the Bomberman revitalization did very well for them.
5653000	5659000	So, you know, Goemon. I don't think it's a game people know as well here on this side of the ocean.
5659000	5662000	I don't know. I used to play tons of Legend of the Mystical Ninja.
5662000	5664000	Yeah, Legend of the Mystical Ninja was badass though.
5664000	5668000	That's one of those, like, if you haven't played this Super Nintendo game, you should check that one out.
5668000	5673000	Because it used a lot of the Mode 7 tricks and some of the retro shit.
5673000	5678000	Like, you can play the first stage of Gradius in that game. Which is cool.
5679000	5687000	And then in other news, there have been some other speedruns announced for Summer Games Done Quick 2018.
5687000	5693000	Including Cuphead, Metroid Samus Returns, Super Mario Odyssey.
5693000	5697000	And it's going to be happening on June 24th through July 1st.
5697000	5702000	And hopefully, well, I'll get a chance to watch it.
5702000	5708000	One of them actually I'm interested in is a Final Fantasy 6 speedrun that's glitchless.
5708000	5712000	Yeah, it was all espers too. That looked cool.
5712000	5713000	Ooh, that would be cool.
5713000	5719000	I was going to say, the first thing I did when I heard that they announced their lineup, immediately looked for P.T.
5719000	5720000	Very disappointing.
5720000	5722000	To see if it was there and why is the clock over there.
5722000	5725000	Because they'd have to know the triggers.
5725000	5726000	I know, I know.
5726000	5730000	But other games listed are A Hat in Time, Celeste, which I almost picked up.
5731000	5736000	Divinity Original Sin 2, Eichen Class, and a good bunch of others.
5736000	5742000	Though, I don't know, they always need to end with Super Metroid and last year's didn't.
5742000	5744000	Are they going to end with it this year?
5744000	5745000	I don't think so.
5745000	5746000	Wow.
5746000	5753000	But they also have a good backup list, I guess, for if they get extra time or make tiers or whatnot.
5753000	5758000	I always like races. Whenever they do races, it's awesome.
5758000	5760000	Yeah, the Super Metroid race was really fun.
5761000	5762000	Yeah.
5762000	5766000	Like two people just like died right away.
5766000	5769000	How about a P.T. race? I'd be in for that.
5770000	5771000	Alright.
5771000	5772000	You'd have to know your triggers.
5772000	5777000	Or the swordless, I like the swordless randomized items, Legends, all the...
5777000	5778000	Those are fun.
5778000	5780000	Those are great, yeah.
5780000	5785000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out what speed games might be ran this week.
5785000	5788000	New in retail and digitally.
5788000	5792000	There's actually some things coming out this week, so that's kind of nice.
5792000	5795000	We have a game called Dark Rose Valkyrie on PC.
5795000	5799000	A game called Extinction on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
5799000	5803000	Owlboy is making its console debut on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5803000	5808000	A game called Project Nimbus Code Marae on PlayStation 4.
5808000	5814000	We have a game called Regalia of Men and Monarchs, Rail Edition on PlayStation 4.
5815000	5820000	Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice on Xbox One.
5820000	5822000	Maelstrom on PC.
5822000	5826000	Robocraft Infinity on Xbox One.
5826000	5829000	Ys Origins on Xbox One.
5829000	5834000	Then we've got Death and Request on PlayStation 4.
5834000	5836000	Also coming out a little bit later in the week,
5836000	5840000	Regalia of Men and Monarchs, Royal Edition on the Switch and Xbox One.
5840000	5843000	And then, that's it.
5845000	5853000	Okay, let's travel over to Japan, where that same Death and Request game comes out in a regular and Death and box in Japan on April the 12th.
5853000	5858000	Cities Skylines gets its PlayStation 4 edition in Japan also on the 12th.
5858000	5865000	And a new release of Darkest Dungeon with Chinese subs comes out for the greater Asian region also on April the 12th.
5866000	5870000	Checking the Vita, believe it or not, nothing this week, because the Vita is still supported in Japan.
5870000	5873000	They have a release next week on the 19th, just not this week.
5873000	5875000	Then looking quickly at the Switch and the DS.
5875000	5880000	Looks like The Snack World trays Jarere's Gold.
5880000	5883000	I don't know if I'm saying that right, but that's a level 5 game.
5883000	5885000	So, I mean, there's got to be something to that.
5885000	5887000	Maybe that's something that will come out over here eventually.
5887000	5891000	I don't know, but Snack World, maybe that's going to be their next Yokai watch, who knows.
5891000	5895000	But that is going to be out on the Switch, so that will probably be a pretty big release being that that's a level 5 game.
5895000	5899000	3DS doesn't really have anything this week, so otherwise it is pretty quiet over in Japan.
5899000	5901000	How about Europe, DarkSakura?
5901000	5913000	A few things. We have, let's see, on the 10th we have Extinction on PlayStation and Xbox, the new ones.
5913000	5916000	Darkest Dungeon Crimson Edition for Switch.
5916000	5919000	Steam World Dig 2 for Switch, that's on April 12th.
5919000	5926000	On April 13th we have Rick and Morty Virtual Rick-ality, and that's it.
5926000	5927000	Alright.
5927000	5933000	So, this, maybe because I was looking ahead in the month, in a couple weeks from now, of course, we have the Nintendo Labo stuff.
5933000	5938000	Let's see someone speedrun that, and that includes building the peripherals that they need to do the game.
5938000	5943000	That would actually be a really funny speedrun to submit, a Nintendo Labo building.
5943000	5944000	You have to build it and then play it.
5944000	5947000	That sounds like something out of Odyssey of the Mind.
5947000	5954000	Nintendo Labo Robot Kit, I want to see the speedrun of that, including building the whole robot armor that you have to wear.
5954000	5958000	Alright, usually this part of the show we would do the mailbag.
5958000	5959000	What mailbag?
5959000	5965000	The one that we have that's always open 24-7. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5965000	5968000	But DarkSakura opened it, and there was nothing there.
5968000	5970000	There were some moths.
5970000	5972000	The moths ate all the mail.
5972000	5975000	That's right, the moths ate all the mail, so there it is.
5975000	5976000	And then the dust bunnies ate the moths.
5976000	5979000	Alright, we didn't have anything that we didn't read.
5979000	5981000	I thought we had something we didn't read on the other show.
5981000	5982000	I hope we didn't miss something.
5982000	5984000	If we did, I'm sorry, re-forward it. We'll get to it next week.
5984000	5987000	But participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5987000	5989000	So then we'll get back into some news. Loki.
5989000	5997000	Alright, so apparently there's this study that is done with Take Two games.
5998000	6000000	Rockstar North, I should say.
6000000	6007000	There's been quite a pay inequality issue with genders at the company.
6007000	6015000	So they're saying that apparently women are paid 64% lower than men,
6015000	6020000	while the median is 34% lower.
6020000	6030000	So they're saying that on average the female employee makes 0.36 euro for every 1 euro made by a man.
6030000	6032000	So that's terrible.
6032000	6036000	Why is it so fucking hard to not pay women and men the same?
6036000	6039000	Why is this so hard? Why is this a challenge?
6039000	6043000	Now I realize that you said euros, so this is a problem that goes beyond.
6043000	6047000	We talk about it here in this country, but clearly this is a problem in a lot of other places too.
6047000	6050000	Yeah, it's worldwide. But what I want to know, and don't get me wrong,
6050000	6055000	I think that there is a problem with pay scale and making sure everyone's paid fairly,
6055000	6061000	but we're talking female programmers and male programmers, same job?
6061000	6067000	Or are we just talking overall in the company maybe women don't hold the same positions as men there?
6067000	6069000	And that could be a whole other issue altogether.
6069000	6071000	Exactly. My brain went there too.
6071000	6076000	Maybe they're averaging everything and you don't have as many women in leadership positions,
6076000	6079000	which, don't get me wrong, is a whole other problem.
6079000	6082000	But we need to get into, well, what is the root of this problem?
6082000	6087000	Are these numbers because women are not in these higher positions?
6087000	6091000	Yeah, and trust me, with Rockstar North, they make fucking Grand Theft Auto and shit.
6091000	6096000	They should be paid handsomely. Everybody should be paid handsomely for that game.
6096000	6097000	Alan Alchemy in chat says,
6097000	6101000	People are told it's rude to discuss money so co-workers don't compare notes.
6101000	6104000	Also, there is a fear they will be resented if they make more,
6104000	6109000	when in reality the underpaid person is far more likely to resent their superior.
6109000	6111000	And this, again, this is another country we're talking about.
6111000	6114000	This isn't, but, I mean, not to, I'm not trying to deny it doesn't happen here,
6114000	6117000	because obviously it does, but I'm just saying this, again,
6117000	6121000	is a problem in the industry, period.
6121000	6126000	Well, on top of that, too, I've seen it happen in many places of employment,
6126000	6130000	but, you know, when you get a raise or when, you know, you get your hiring salary,
6130000	6133000	they tell you not to tell anybody.
6133000	6136000	And I think that that lack of transparency for people,
6136000	6140000	now, I understand in some cases you get, like, a higher merit.
6140000	6143000	For example, if you have a higher level of education,
6143000	6149000	sometimes you'll get paid more than someone who may not have, like, say, gone to college.
6149000	6151000	And it can also be your experience, too.
6151000	6154000	Like, if you're coming from a job, you know, that has a higher,
6154000	6156000	you already have a higher salary in one place, you know,
6157000	6162000	you might get hired on for more of a salary than you would if you didn't have a job with a higher salary,
6162000	6167000	if they're looking at salary history or something, or how well you negotiate for your pay.
6167000	6170000	But there still should not be such a heavy disparity.
6170000	6171000	Right. Right.
6171000	6172000	It's disgusting.
6172000	6175000	I wonder if, with the whole experience and everything,
6175000	6181000	we're not paying now in this industry for a problem that's existed in the industry since the 80s and 90s,
6181000	6185000	where women were, like, straight up excluded from a lot of elements.
6185000	6189000	I mean, granted, there was a lot of women that did very important things in this industry, right?
6189000	6192000	Like, Roberta Williams is one of the first that comes to mind, like, one of the all-times greats.
6192000	6196000	But anyway, my point is, is that clearly you didn't have as many women in the industry then,
6196000	6198000	so you don't have as many experienced people.
6198000	6201000	Now, again, I'm not saying that makes it right.
6201000	6202000	Please don't mishear me with this.
6202000	6206000	But, you know, I just, I wonder if, you know, in trying to look for,
6206000	6209000	how did we get here and how do we make it better, if maybe that's a cause,
6209000	6213000	is that we're paying for problems of 20 years ago, which just goes to show,
6213000	6215000	you can't expect the future to fix everything.
6215000	6217000	You've got to fix things now because it's going to impact the future.
6217000	6220000	Yeah, and I can't imagine, like, even just in the gaming industry,
6220000	6224000	I can't imagine, like, a position that would be better, a female or a male would be better at.
6224000	6228000	I mean, it's just, honestly, I don't even really think about that when it comes to, like,
6228000	6231000	games and programming and artists and stuff like that.
6231000	6235000	It's just, like, your talent is your talent regardless of what your gender is.
6235000	6237000	It's just, I don't know.
6237000	6242000	I don't know how this kind of problem still exists in the world these days.
6242000	6248000	But one note they did mention, though, they said part of the reason that Rockstar North is such an outlier
6248000	6251000	is due to the lack of women in higher paying roles at the company.
6251000	6258000	According to the database, only 8% of Rockstar North employees are in the top quartile of hourly pay at the company,
6258000	6265000	are women, and most of the women in the company work in lower roles at the lower end of the pay scale.
6267000	6271000	All right. Well, I don't know if this is a problem we can solve near an Orange Lounge radio.
6272000	6274000	But, A, it shouldn't be this hard.
6274000	6279000	B, you know, we have to put these issues out there and highlight them and point and say that is a problem
6279000	6281000	in order for something to get done about it.
6281000	6286000	Correct. And not to say that everybody should just jump ship from a company or something like that,
6286000	6291000	but, like, a lot of people, and it doesn't necessarily have to be with discrepancy in pay,
6291000	6297000	it could be just they don't like the, you know, not the ethics,
6297000	6303000	but, like, the environment of a big AAA publisher or they're looking to be creative on their own or something like that,
6303000	6306000	and a lot of people are spinning off in their own indie studios and being successful,
6306000	6310000	so that might be an option as well. I mean, I don't know.
6310000	6313000	But, then again, it's Rockstar, and Rockstar's fucking Rockstar, so, you know.
6313000	6318000	Well, you know who has to be willing to bring up that there's an issue with how women get paid?
6319000	6320000	Men.
6321000	6323000	Which is also stupid.
6324000	6325000	It just goes back...
6325000	6327000	Would you say that's true, though, what I just said?
6327000	6329000	Well, yes. I mean, they...
6329000	6338000	But the thing is that that goes back to remember that thing where the male co-worker and female co-worker traded their signatures,
6339000	6343000	and suddenly all the things that she had been complaining about he saw happening,
6343000	6347000	and, like, oh, well, this is really happening, and no one believed it until a man said it,
6347000	6350000	where we've been saying this shit for years.
6350000	6353000	You should have fucking listened in the first place.
6354000	6355000	Stupid.
6355000	6359000	All right, well, let's move on to a story to hopefully make us feel a little better,
6359000	6363000	because this story involves, you know what, throwing it up and going outside.
6363000	6368000	It's a story about Pokemon Go, which, you know, all of us here at OLR play in some capacity,
6368000	6370000	some of us a little more than others.
6370000	6375000	But, anyway, Pokemon Go trying to do some good things in the real world here with an Earth Day celebration.
6375000	6381000	They're encouraging folks to actually help clean up the world on April 22nd, which is Earth Day.
6381000	6387000	Niantic is in a partnership with Mission Blue, PlayMob, and local nonprofits to encourage Pokemon Go players
6387000	6391000	to go to select places and pick up trash and clean up the environment.
6391000	6396000	If so many players do this, and they are watching, like, how many people actually contribute to this,
6396000	6403000	then globally players will earn boosts to stardust when catching ground, water, and grass-type Pokemon,
6403000	6407000	you know, earthy things, depending on how many registered players are in the area.
6407000	6409000	So that's pretty cool.
6409000	6411000	You know, they did something like this in Ingress as well.
6411000	6415000	They did the Mission Days, and I can't remember, oh, God, they had a special name to them.
6415000	6417000	Maybe a Zet knows, because I don't remember what they were called.
6417000	6420000	But Operation Clear Blue, that was it, right?
6420000	6426000	But Ingress did something similar where, you know, they encouraged these public service type of days, too.
6426000	6431000	So Niantic has a little bit of experience with this.
6431000	6435000	Also, speaking of Niantic and things that they're doing involving Pokemon Go,
6435000	6440000	you may or may not remember, there's a class-action lawsuit that was filed about Pokemon Go Fest,
6440000	6446000	and this was because people paid money to travel, fly into, stay in hotels at the Pokemon Go Fest,
6446000	6448000	only to have the game not fucking work.
6448000	6454000	Now, people were already given, what, the cost of their ticket back and, like, $100 in Pokemon Go currency.
6454000	6464000	Well, Niantic just settled a class-action lawsuit over the festival, $1.57 million to settle this.
6464000	6472000	There's going to be an official website that will open by May 25th, and this payout will help cover hotel and transportation costs.
6472000	6475000	You have to read the fine print, though, if you were affected by this.
6475000	6477000	You will need evidence that you were there.
6477000	6482000	You have to have checked into the festival on Pokemon Go, meaning you didn't sell your ticket to somebody else.
6482000	6486000	You have to show receipts if there were more than $107 in expenses,
6486000	6490000	so be prepared to contact the hotel and get your folio and all that stuff.
6491000	6494000	And this may not, you may not get reimbursed dollar for dollar,
6494000	6497000	because lawyer fees are going to be impacted here and all this other stuff, too,
6497000	6502000	but you may at least be able to get some of it back, which I guess is better than nothing.
6502000	6508000	So, a little bad news there on Pokemon Go, and I really just don't see them trying to do something of this scale again.
6508000	6511000	They've been having a lot more success with the local community days, I think,
6511000	6514000	which we have a Mareep event coming up this Sunday.
6514000	6518000	Well, it's good, too, because, like, I hate, I wouldn't want to have to fly all the way to Chicago
6518000	6522000	to play, like, an event like that. I like that it's anywhere.
6523000	6528000	Well, at least with Ingress, they kind of travel around to a lot of different cities,
6528000	6534000	although they seem to keep skipping Sacramento again and again, but that's another conversation.
6534000	6537000	At least we had one in San Francisco, which is a reasonably close distance,
6537000	6541000	and, like, they're doing one in San Diego, Las Vegas, Portland.
6541000	6545000	So, you know, there's cities that we can get to in a reasonable amount of time and so forth,
6545000	6550000	so, by driving or whatever, so at least they're kind of doing these sorts of events.
6550000	6554000	But Ingress just doesn't have nearly as many people as Pokemon Go has,
6554000	6556000	which is kind of how they can get away with it,
6556000	6559000	and probably why they thought Pokemon Go Fest would not be any big deal,
6559000	6565000	because, remember, I missed an episode of OLR a couple years ago
6565000	6570000	because I went to Chicago to participate in a Niantic event, and it was fine.
6570000	6573000	It was Ingress, not Pokemon Go, but it went off fine.
6573000	6574000	Our phones worked.
6574000	6581000	The only difficulty we ran into was that some dummy decided it would be a good idea to have a shard,
6581000	6584000	which is one of the things you're trying to control, at Trump Tower.
6584000	6585000	I said, tump.
6585000	6588000	At Trump Tower, they actually had a shard spawn there,
6588000	6591000	and this was, like, two days after those massive protests.
6591000	6593000	You remember when there were all those protests after election day?
6593000	6594000	Yeah.
6594000	6596000	Yeah, there were all these protests going on, so the police were out.
6596000	6601000	We couldn't get to this shard, so we had to sneak in a dunk of donuts across the street and do it there,
6601000	6602000	and we got donuts.
6602000	6603000	Donuts and a shard.
6603000	6604000	That's right, donuts and a shard.
6604000	6605000	It's win-win.
6605000	6608000	Actually, we lost the shard to the other team, because they had way more-
6608000	6609000	They also wanted donuts.
6609000	6613000	Well, they saw what we were doing, too, so they figured it out,
6613000	6616000	but they also had way more fucking people than we did.
6616000	6620000	I remember my little team of, like, nine people, and we'd be standing there like,
6620000	6623000	yeah, we're defending this portal, woo, and then it was a nighttime anomaly, right?
6623000	6627000	So you'd see all these blue, which is the opposition color for me in the game,
6627000	6630000	you'd see all these blue glow sticks and blue lights down the street,
6630000	6633000	slowly moving your direction as you were just sitting there going, ah, fuck.
6633000	6635000	There's nothing we're going to be able to do.
6635000	6637000	We're not going to be able to hold it against that many people.
6637000	6640000	But we had fun trying, and that's the important part.
6640000	6641000	All right, let's move on.
6641000	6642000	Dark Sakura.
6642000	6651000	Well, last but not least for me, there may be potentially another Nier game.
6652000	6662000	The creator of Nier Automata, that's Yoko Taro, and Yosuke Saito is the producer,
6662000	6667000	and Keiichi Okabe, who is the composer, actually answered some questions,
6667000	6670000	and of course the game came up quite a bit.
6670000	6674000	And so while there weren't a few leaks out there,
6674000	6679000	there was a point where Saito spoke possibly about returning to the series.
6679000	6683000	So then of course it made everybody super happy,
6683000	6689000	but the quote is, I do think that we might be able to open the door in the Nier universe.
6689000	6694000	I don't know how long it might take, but I do want you guys to look forward to that.
6694000	6702000	So they did say that they weren't super happy with the idea of making a sequel,
6702000	6704000	but maybe something in the same universe.
6704000	6706000	So there you go.
6707000	6712000	I know a lot of people really want to see that series continue in one way or another,
6712000	6714000	so this will be good news, I guess.
6714000	6717000	Yeah, I think it would be hopefully pretty neat.
6717000	6719000	So, I mean, it'd be nice.
6719000	6722000	I had the game on my wish list for a long time,
6722000	6728000	but maybe now, especially if they're going to do more with it, I'll be interested in playing it.
6729000	6733000	All right, just a few more stories before we get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,
6733000	6734000	all one word on Skype.
6734000	6735000	But first, Loki.
6735000	6744000	So, you may remember that there was, well, last year kind of started this whole really terrible loot box thing
6744000	6747000	where companies were kind of interjecting loot boxes in the games
6747000	6749000	where it really didn't have any place to be.
6749000	6756000	One of those, of course, that can seem to be kind of ruined by this was Middle-Earth Shadow of War.
6757000	6765000	So now, fast forward to this week, we get a comment from developers of the game,
6765000	6770000	or I should say the publisher of Warner Brothers, talking about what they're going to do to fix that.
6770000	6775000	And so they have decided that they're going to remove the loot boxes from the game.
6775000	6776000	They stated,
6776000	6782000	The core promise of the Nemesis system is the ability to build relationships with your personal allies and enemies
6782000	6784000	in a dynamic, open world.
6784000	6789000	While purchasing Orcs in the market is more immediate and provides additional player options,
6789000	6796000	we have come to realize that providing this choice risks undermining the heart of our game, the Nemesis system.
6796000	6801000	It allows you to miss out on awesome player stories you have otherwise created
6801000	6806000	and compromises those same stories if you don't buy anything.
6806000	6811000	And simply being aware that they are available for the purchase reduces the immersion in the world
6811000	6815000	and takes away from the challenge of building your personal army and your fortresses.
6815000	6819000	In order to fully restore the core promise of the Nemesis system,
6819000	6824000	we will be permanently removing gold, war chests, and the market from Shadow of War.
6824000	6827000	Removing it on July 17th, of course.
6827000	6830000	That's almost a year after the game came out.
6830000	6838000	So really, all this is to is try to save some face now that this stuff isn't selling as well as it used to.
6838000	6844000	Because, don't give me this shit that they didn't fucking know this ruined this from the get-go.
6844000	6848000	Because people were fucking telling them every single day that it was.
6850000	6851000	So don't be fooled.
6851000	6855000	It is nice, I guess, to see a lot of these companies are starting to go,
6855000	6858000	whoops, we maybe need to do a swift turnaround on this stuff.
6858000	6860000	No, it's just the same face. They didn't feel bad for it.
6860000	6862000	If they felt bad for it, they would have made ac...
6862000	6863000	They would have...
6863000	6864000	Oh no, I'm not saying they felt bad.
6864000	6867000	I'm just saying the reality is they realized they have to do this.
6869000	6870000	Alright.
6870000	6871000	I just, I don't forgive them.
6871000	6873000	I didn't buy the game, so, you know.
6873000	6874000	Me neither.
6874000	6875000	No skin off my back, so.
6875000	6876000	Alright.
6876000	6879000	Now I got one more story for you guys, and I saved the best for last.
6879000	6882000	Although, you have to file this in the category of rumors.
6882000	6886000	Jamie, I want you to try to not get too excited at what I'm about to say, okay?
6886000	6887000	Try me.
6887000	6892000	But apparently, Nintendo has recently been revamping the Animal Crossing site.
6892000	6896000	And in the revamp of this site, there's a lot of placeholders.
6896000	6900000	Placeholders in places like the news page and the video page.
6900000	6903000	So there are placeholders all over the place.
6903000	6909000	In fact, the Twitter account Leak Review did a very detailed analysis about what this could all mean,
6909000	6913000	and how all these pages with Lauren Ipsum all over it and stuff,
6913000	6918000	where there's soon to be more copy for possibly some type of unannounced game.
6918000	6922000	So Dark Sakura, you know what they might announce at E3.
6922000	6925000	Amiibo Festival 2.
6925000	6928000	Hey, you know what? I also wouldn't be unhappy by that.
6928000	6931000	Oh really? Oh yeah, sorry, you're like the one person I know that liked that game.
6931000	6933000	You know, they have those Amiibos marked down a lot.
6933000	6934000	They're like two bucks.
6934000	6935000	I already own them all.
6935000	6936000	Yeah, I know.
6936000	6938000	Well, you can own second copies.
6938000	6940000	Buy me some. No, I'm just kidding.
6940000	6942000	So, again, it's a stretch.
6942000	6945000	We're reading the tea leaves the way we want to read them.
6945000	6949000	But, you know, it seems like wild hopes.
6949000	6953000	Perhaps, perhaps they're not bringing back Virtual Console
6953000	6957000	because they're going to include Virtual Console games within Animal Crossing.
6957000	6958000	Stop fucking with my emotions.
6958000	6961000	Well, you know about Amazon France had Animal Crossing 3D
6961000	6964000	as a placeholder for September 28th release.
6964000	6965000	Huh.
6965000	6966000	Yeah.
6966000	6968000	3D, like another, oh god.
6968000	6970000	They listed Animal Crossing 3D.
6970000	6974000	If they do another 3DS game, so help me god.
6974000	6976000	I actually wouldn't be mad at it.
6976000	6977000	I would.
6977000	6978000	I would.
6978000	6980000	It is time for a fucking Switch game.
6980000	6983000	But, you know, it could just be a placeholder,
6983000	6987000	but it was something on there, so.
6987000	6988000	All right.
6988000	6992000	Well, everybody brace yourselves to the upcoming Nintendo Direct.
6992000	6994000	JD says, stop hating on the 3DS.
6994000	6996000	I am not hating on the 3DS.
6996000	7002000	The 3DS is a great console from the years 2006 to 2016,
7002000	7004000	but it's time to move on.
7004000	7006000	The Switch is here, yo.
7006000	7007000	All right.
7007000	7008000	We'll see.
7008000	7009000	We'll see.
7009000	7010000	We'll see.
7010000	7012000	Anyway, if you want to give us a call and yell about Animal Crossing
7012000	7014000	or anything that's on your mind,
7014000	7018000	the Skype line is open now over at Orange Lounge Radio,
7018000	7020000	all one word on Skype if you want to get through.
7020000	7023000	Again, that is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7023000	7026000	JD says Nintendo is releasing stuff through 2019.
7026000	7028000	Yes, I know.
7028000	7030000	The Luigi's Mansion remake no one asked for.
7030000	7033000	My Switch can't fit in my pocket like my 3DS can.
7033000	7035000	Well, you just need bigger pockets.
7035000	7038000	No, you know, JD, here's the thing.
7038000	7040000	Fuck gender roles.
7040000	7042000	You get to carry a purse now.
7042000	7043000	It's a fanny pack.
7043000	7044000	You get to carry a purse.
7044000	7045000	No, not a fanny pack.
7045000	7048000	You are going to carry a man purse with you,
7048000	7052000	and you keep your Switch in your purse.
7052000	7055000	JD says I would lose it.
7055000	7057000	Have you ever lost your purse, Dark Sakura?
7057000	7058000	They're pretty, I guess.
7058000	7059000	Never.
7059000	7061000	Yeah, I guess if you, I guess it could be,
7061000	7064000	I could see like leaving, you know, I lost my little gotcha,
7064000	7066000	the little Pokemon Go auto-catching thing.
7066000	7070000	I lost that gotcha in a fucking lift in Atlanta
7070000	7071000	when I was there.
7071000	7072000	I had to buy a new one.
7072000	7073000	Isn't that depressing?
7073000	7074000	I know I'm depressed.
7074000	7076000	I'm depressed.
7076000	7077000	All right, let's get to a call.
7077000	7078000	We have a call on the line.
7078000	7079000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7079000	7080000	Who's this?
7080000	7082000	Hi, this is Ray Jeter.
7082000	7083000	Hey, Ray Jeter.
7083000	7084000	What's on your mind?
7084000	7085000	Not a whole lot.
7085000	7088000	You know, as you were mentioning,
7088000	7090000	towards the beginning of the show, you know,
7091000	7095000	for Episcopal Knights, you had been streaming Nino Kundi 2.
7095000	7097000	Yes, been streaming Nino Kundi 2, yep.
7097000	7099000	Yeah, in fact, I had caught the streams
7099000	7102000	and we were chatting about RPGs.
7102000	7105000	Now, all that being said,
7105000	7109000	I'm going to make this call really to RPGs.
7109000	7116000	Yeah, I would like to pose this to the three of you
7116000	7120000	and if Chad wants the answer too, by all means, answer.
7120000	7121000	Okay, what's that?
7121000	7126000	At least you specifically are known to love RPGs.
7126000	7129000	Now, case in point, Mass Effect 3,
7129000	7131000	you bought that god damn sound many times.
7131000	7141000	That being said, what game drew you into the RPG genre first
7141000	7145000	and why are you such a fan of this genre?
7146000	7148000	What game, and I'm going to open this to all our hosts
7148000	7150000	because I know you all like RPGs,
7150000	7152000	what game got you into the RPG genre
7152000	7154000	and what was it about that game that you enjoyed the most?
7154000	7158000	For me, it was honestly probably the original Dragon Warrior
7158000	7160000	because that's what they called it here on the NES.
7160000	7162000	I mean, that's the first one I remember playing
7162000	7165000	that had the whole strategy guide that came with it and everything
7165000	7167000	because I could go further back to the 2600
7167000	7169000	and stuff like Adventure and things like that,
7169000	7173000	but I mean, those were more kind of like action-based games.
7173000	7175000	I don't think you really got the roleplay in that same sense
7175000	7178000	until we really got to the NES and some of those early games,
7178000	7180000	so that was kind of the early one for me.
7180000	7182000	What did I like about those games?
7182000	7185000	Probably the fact that they were a little more story-driven,
7185000	7188000	that it was an open world, even though when you kind of look back,
7188000	7190000	a lot of those early RPGs,
7190000	7192000	especially the original Final Fantasy and stuff,
7192000	7194000	they weren't as open as you think.
7194000	7196000	You could go around one little part of the world
7196000	7199000	and then it was like, oh, but to get to this world,
7199000	7200000	you're going to need a boat,
7200000	7202000	and to get to this thing, you're going to need an airship,
7202000	7205000	and to this thing, everything is kind of tunneled in that sense,
7205000	7209000	even in the earliest RPGs, but it did feel open,
7209000	7212000	and what I liked about it is that if you were kind of struggling
7212000	7214000	and having problems getting past a certain point,
7214000	7216000	you could kind of level up your character
7216000	7219000	and you could get past that point by just kind of like
7219000	7221000	persistence pays off.
7221000	7224000	And that's true of other genres of games, too.
7224000	7227000	If you want to do good in a game like a platforming game
7227000	7229000	like, I don't know, Spyro, like we talked about earlier,
7229000	7230000	if you have a difficult level,
7230000	7231000	you got to keep practicing and practicing and practicing,
7231000	7233000	and again, eventually that persistence pays off.
7233000	7237000	And I think in an RPG, especially those old JRPGs,
7237000	7240000	you really felt that, which is why I'm really harsh
7240000	7242000	on Final Fantasy VIII sometimes,
7242000	7244000	because that is one of the first games I remember playing
7244000	7246000	where persistence didn't pay off,
7246000	7248000	because the enemies would level as you did
7248000	7250000	and there was this whole other system in it and stuff,
7250000	7252000	and so that's why, and again, I'm not trying to open up
7252000	7254000	this whole thing for debate again.
7254000	7257000	It's not up for debate. How I feel is not up for debate.
7257000	7260000	But I respect that there are people that enjoy Final Fantasy VIII,
7260000	7263000	but for me, I just have a lot of negative connotations with it
7263000	7265000	because that is when I remember feeling like,
7265000	7269000	oh, this is an RPG that kind of doesn't have
7269000	7272000	a lot of what I've enjoyed in other games and so forth.
7272000	7274000	But again, as far as Final Fantasy VIII goes,
7274000	7276000	the story is good if you're willing to put up
7276000	7277000	with the game mechanics to get there.
7277000	7279000	So my problem was never the story.
7279000	7282000	And as RPGs kind of continued on, I think stories,
7282000	7284000	especially in games like Final Fantasy,
7284000	7287000	when we got to VII, but even VI,
7287000	7289000	I mean, or when it was on the Super Nintendo
7289000	7292000	here in America when I was a teen, it was Final Fantasy III, right?
7292000	7296000	Anybody my age that played Final Fantasy III in the US
7296000	7299000	at that age remembers that fucking opera scene.
7299000	7303000	And that's like the earliest version of a Final Fantasy cut scene
7303000	7306000	was the opera scene, and it was fantastic.
7306000	7309000	Anyway, I've blabbed long enough. How about my co-host?
7309000	7313000	Loki, your first RPG, and what made you enjoy RPGs?
7313000	7317000	Probably Dragon Warrior as well.
7317000	7321000	I don't know. I don't remember a whole ton of what I played.
7321000	7324000	Early stuff. Like, I can't think of a particular RPG.
7324000	7327000	I just know, like, I used to play a lot of the Final Fantasy games.
7327000	7333000	I remember Final Fantasy III or VI was, you know, really good.
7333000	7335000	But I mean, I don't know.
7335000	7337000	I know one of the first games I played I know was on the NES,
7337000	7340000	and that was Dragon Warrior.
7340000	7341000	How about Dark Sakura?
7341000	7343000	I don't even fucking remember.
7343000	7345000	I just always played them.
7345000	7347000	It's always been part of your...
7347000	7350000	I mean, if you want to really go for it, I could probably say
7350000	7353000	Quest for the Rings. You know, the...
7353000	7355000	Oh, shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7355000	7356000	On the Odyssey 2.
7356000	7357000	On the Odyssey, yeah.
7357000	7358000	We played a shitload of that game.
7358000	7361000	So maybe you don't have that same recollection
7361000	7364000	because you played D&D so much and paper-based games.
7364000	7366000	I didn't play D&D until I was older.
7366000	7367000	I meant paper games, though.
7367000	7369000	Yeah, but I didn't play those until I was older.
7369000	7371000	Oh, really? I thought you'd been playing those all the time.
7371000	7374000	No, I'd been playing the video game ones when I was a kid.
7374000	7375000	Interesting.
7375000	7377000	I mean, I guess if I was going to pick one,
7377000	7379000	I guess the Legend of the Rings would be...
7379000	7384000	or Quest for the Rings would be the closest thing to my first RPG ever.
7384000	7388000	You know, and I did a lot of text-based RPGs,
7388000	7393000	and, you know, I really can't put my finger on it, you know.
7393000	7398000	It could just be because I'm, you know, heading toward my elderly years.
7398000	7400000	Since my birthday's in two weeks.
7400000	7401000	Phantasm Chat says,
7401000	7403000	I don't even fucking remember.
7403000	7404000	Y'all crack me up.
7404000	7405000	Hey, you know what?
7405000	7409000	We can only give you truth here at Orange Lounge Radio,
7409000	7412000	and sometimes our brains don't fucking remember.
7412000	7413000	That's how it goes.
7413000	7417000	No, I'm getting on in years.
7417000	7418000	Shake my cane.
7418000	7420000	Some other random answers in chat.
7420000	7421000	Bobby Black Wolf says,
7421000	7424000	I had the A, D, and D games on Intellivision,
7424000	7425000	but I also didn't get them.
7425000	7429000	You know, it may have been a little much for that age at the time.
7429000	7430000	Let's see.
7430000	7431000	Sia Tabiri says,
7431000	7436000	the big one that got me into RPGs was probably Popolacross on PSP,
7436000	7437000	or Lunar for GBA.
7437000	7438000	I love Popolacross.
7438000	7439000	Let's see.
7439000	7440000	Kossen says,
7440000	7441000	I played Final Fantasy 1,
7441000	7445000	and I was very glad to have the Nintendo Power issue dedicated to the game.
7445000	7447000	Kossen also says,
7447000	7448000	Crystalis.
7448000	7449000	The thing about,
7449000	7450000	Crystalis is like kind of RPG,
7450000	7453000	but there's this weird kind of like action element
7453000	7456000	where it's kind of in a similar bucket to like the original Zelda to me,
7456000	7458000	but certainly those games were just like gateway games,
7458000	7459000	you know, in a way.
7459000	7462000	Like would I have enjoyed the original Zelda as much
7462000	7464000	if I didn't have Nintendo Power?
7464000	7465000	I don't know.
7465000	7467000	Like it would have been really hard.
7467000	7469000	I'm not sure I would have ever gotten through the second quest
7469000	7470000	without Nintendo Power.
7470000	7471000	I don't know.
7471000	7473000	I don't remember how I got through the first quest.
7473000	7474000	I know, right?
7474000	7475000	Like we were just smarter then.
7475000	7476000	I don't know how it is.
7476000	7477000	All right.
7477000	7478000	Before I let you go, Spaznator,
7478000	7479000	or excuse me,
7479000	7480000	I always say your Skype name.
7480000	7481000	Sorry, Raginator,
7481000	7482000	but when I look at the screen,
7482000	7483000	it says something different.
7483000	7484000	Raginator,
7484000	7485000	what about you?
7485000	7486000	I'm flipping this question on you.
7486000	7488000	What's the first RPG you remember playing,
7488000	7490000	and why did you keep playing it?
7490000	7492000	It's weird for me.
7492000	7494000	You know,
7494000	7497000	I had both Final Fantasy 1
7497000	7500000	and Dragon Warrior for the NES,
7500000	7502000	but bear in mind,
7502000	7503000	back in those days,
7503000	7505000	my parents did all the game buying,
7505000	7507000	and you know,
7507000	7510000	a lot of times my father would buy games
7510000	7512000	with himself in mind,
7512000	7514000	so I just ended up playing it.
7514000	7519000	And I thought those two games I just listed were all right,
7519000	7522000	but I truly didn't get into RPGs
7522000	7527000	until I got my PS1 back in 97.
7527000	7531000	I happened to go up to my local Toys R Us,
7531000	7535000	and they had a kiosking place for PS1,
7535000	7540000	and they had a trailer for Wild Arms playing.
7540000	7541000	Oh, yeah.
7541000	7544000	Yeah, which included the opening cutscene.
7544000	7549000	It's a side for anyone that has not played it.
7549000	7552000	The opening cutscene was fully rendered,
7552000	7557000	FMV anime,
7557000	7560000	and I was just blown away by that.
7560000	7562000	I ended up buying the game,
7562000	7564000	and once I got the game,
7564000	7565000	I found out,
7565000	7566000	hey, you know,
7566000	7568000	there's actually a good game behind this,
7569000	7571000	not just a nice cutscene.
7571000	7573000	It's more than just a pretty face.
7573000	7576000	Yeah, my second one,
7576000	7578000	which I got shortly after,
7578000	7580000	was Vandal Hearts,
7580000	7582000	which was put out by Konami.
7582000	7583000	Oh, I remember Vandal Hearts.
7583000	7584000	I played that too, yeah.
7584000	7586000	Yeah, really great story,
7586000	7589000	turn-based, kind of like Final Fantasy Tactics,
7589000	7592000	and then what really blew me away,
7592000	7593000	even more so,
7593000	7595000	Final Fantasy VII.
7595000	7596000	It was so cinematic,
7596000	7598000	sweeping story, all that.
7598000	7599000	Oh, yeah.
7599000	7601000	Yeah, and once I played that game,
7601000	7605000	if I wasn't sold on the RPGs
7605000	7607000	based on the prior two games,
7607000	7609000	I was definitely sold then.
7609000	7611000	I'd start buying RPGs left and right.
7611000	7614000	The only thing that pissed me off about Final Fantasy VII,
7614000	7616000	when I first played Final Fantasy VII,
7616000	7617000	and I played a lot of that game.
7617000	7620000	I missed a lot of college just playing Final Fantasy VII.
7620000	7621000	When I first played through that game,
7621000	7622000	the only thing that pissed me off
7622000	7624000	is that through the whole beginning of the game,
7624000	7626000	Aeris was part of my core party.
7626000	7627000	It was like Cloud Aeris,
7627000	7628000	and I think I was using Barret.
7628000	7629000	So I leveled her up a lot,
7629000	7630000	I used her a lot,
7630000	7632000	and then all of a sudden,
7632000	7634000	she was removed from my party.
7634000	7635000	So I was like,
7635000	7636000	Really? Really?
7636000	7638000	All that weight? Really?
7638000	7640000	Yeah, yeah.
7640000	7643000	When I saw the one moment that you're referring to,
7643000	7648000	I practically did a Darth Vader Revenge of the Sith moment.
7648000	7649000	No!
7649000	7650000	Yeah, right?
7650000	7652000	Whereas Dark Sakura was over there going,
7652000	7653000	Yes!
7653000	7655000	Chad Michael's on Drag Race
7655000	7658000	when hearing that both queens would be saved that week.
7658000	7660000	Yes! Yes!
7660000	7662000	That was Dark Sakura.
7662000	7663000	That was me.
7663000	7664000	All right.
7664000	7665000	Anyway, Rage Nator,
7665000	7667000	I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls,
7667000	7668000	but thanks for the question.
7668000	7669000	I appreciate that.
7669000	7671000	Have a nice night, old potato.
7671000	7673000	Killing, killing, killing, killing.
7673000	7675000	You know you got busted for that.
7675000	7677000	I'm hanging up on you for it now. Bye.
7677000	7679000	All right, so the joke behind that is
7679000	7681000	there was this character in Ni No Kuni II,
7681000	7683000	and I called her an old potato.
7683000	7685000	She dressed fierce, but she looked like an old potato.
7685000	7686000	And I was like,
7686000	7688000	first person to tell me I'm that character or something
7688000	7689000	is gonna get a ban.
7689000	7691000	And so, of course, Rage Nator says something,
7691000	7693000	so I actually clicked the button that timed him out.
7693000	7695000	I thought it would only be like a two-minute timeout
7695000	7697000	or something where it would just shut him up for like two minutes.
7697000	7699000	No, it was a ten-minute timeout.
7699000	7702000	At least it wasn't a ban.
7702000	7704000	But I made good on my promise.
7704000	7706000	Anyway, lots of love I'm seeing right now.
7706000	7708000	Dungeon Buster talking a lot about Phantasy Star
7708000	7710000	in the chat as well.
7710000	7712000	It's a game that we kind of missed
7712000	7714000	in mentioning our favorite RPGs.
7714000	7716000	By the way, if you want to give us a call,
7716000	7717000	RPGs or anything else,
7717000	7719000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7719000	7721000	You know, my first memory with Phantasy Star though,
7721000	7723000	besides like seeing it in a magazine
7723000	7724000	and wanting to play it,
7724000	7727000	because I basically was told as a kid
7727000	7730000	it was Sega's version of Final Fantasy, right,
7730000	7732000	which we all know is a real oversimplification.
7732000	7734000	But that's, you know, what it was as a kid.
7734000	7736000	Okay, I wanted to play it for that reason.
7736000	7738000	But honestly, my first introduction to Phantasy Star
7738000	7739000	was Phantasy Star Online.
7739000	7741000	And that game blew my fucking mind
7741000	7743000	like when I played that on the Dreamcast.
7743000	7744000	Like that was the reason.
7744000	7745000	It was pretty awesome.
7745000	7747000	And I didn't play it enough.
7747000	7749000	Yeah, and that was only a couple years before 11.
7749000	7752000	I had to go to the ER while playing the Xbox One.
7752000	7754000	God, I wonder where that game is.
7754000	7755000	Oh, because you played too much.
7755000	7758000	No, no, no, because I ended up having
7758000	7760000	cramps that almost made me pass out.
7760000	7761000	Oh my gosh.
7761000	7763000	And I thought I might have had something else going on.
7763000	7764000	I wonder where that went.
7764000	7766000	I had that game because it was one of the games I got,
7766000	7767000	because I actually won.
7767000	7768000	It's funny.
7768000	7770000	I went to Accuse Our All-Nighter,
7770000	7772000	and they had a raffle there.
7772000	7775000	And I entered the raffle, and I won a Dreamcast.
7775000	7776000	I was like, oh, okay, cool.
7776000	7777000	I have a Dreamcast now,
7777000	7780000	because I wasn't totally expecting to win anything.
7780000	7781000	So then I remember buying a bunch of games,
7781000	7783000	and one of those was Phantasy Star Online.
7783000	7785000	But I don't remember where it is now.
7785000	7787000	I have a lot of my other games I found Tony Hawk.
7787000	7790000	Well, we wouldn't be able to play it online anymore anyway.
7790000	7792000	Well, I don't care about playing it online.
7792000	7795000	I was playing it offline anyways, because dial-up.
7795000	7797000	I'm not going to do dial-up.
7798000	7799000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
7799000	7800000	I had it on Dreamcast,
7800000	7803000	but it was the voice chat of the Xbox version that got me.
7803000	7806000	Oh yeah, that was magic.
7806000	7808000	When you could suddenly, like thanks to fast internet,
7808000	7809000	you could use voice chat.
7809000	7811000	It's like playing telephone all the time.
7811000	7813000	You should just bring it back.
7813000	7814000	Bring it back as backwards compatible,
7814000	7816000	and then add the voice chat in there.
7817000	7818000	Don't.
7818000	7819000	Don't.
7819000	7820000	Do.
7820000	7821000	Not.
7821000	7822000	Not.
7823000	7825000	Especially after we just had that story
7825000	7827000	about the Xbox backwards compatibility.
7827000	7829000	Do not play with my emotions like that,
7829000	7831000	because I will cry if that happens.
7831000	7832000	I'm sure the next thing they'll bring back after that
7832000	7833000	is going to be Game Room.
7833000	7834000	Oh my God.
7834000	7836000	Okay, now you're just making shit up.
7836000	7837000	All right.
7837000	7839000	One more shout out for our Skype line,
7839000	7842000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word,
7842000	7843000	and you can give us a call.
7843000	7844000	Do we have any last minute stories
7844000	7846000	before we wrap up shop tonight?
7846000	7848000	No, it's been a slow week.
7848000	7849000	Yeah, compared to other weeks,
7849000	7850000	it has been a little slower.
7850000	7851000	It has been a little slower, probably.
7851000	7854000	One of the wrestlers in WrestleMania today
7854000	7856000	dressed up as Sub-Zero.
7856000	7858000	Oh yeah, that was all today, wasn't it?
7858000	7859000	Yeah.
7859000	7861000	Oh yeah, I wondered why it seemed like
7861000	7863000	there were just a few less people than usual.
7863000	7866000	I haven't watched any actual wrestling in an age, so.
7866000	7868000	Why would they dress up like Sub-Zero?
7868000	7871000	What did Sami Zayn do during wrestling?
7871000	7873000	That's the only one that I have to keep tabs on,
7873000	7875000	because I'm apparently his twin.
7876000	7878000	I just have to learn to dance like he does.
7881000	7884000	Anyway, DC Nate in our chat room says,
7884000	7885000	what a disappointment.
7885000	7887000	I don't know if that's about WrestleMania or what,
7887000	7890000	but yeah, anyway.
7890000	7892000	All right, well, I don't see our Skype lighting up,
7892000	7894000	so I guess that means we're gonna wrap it up
7894000	7896000	here at Orange Lounge Radio.
7896000	7899000	Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show tonight
7899000	7900000	and participating with us.
7900000	7903000	We appreciate all the feedback that we get from you guys
7903000	7904000	in our mailbag.
7904000	7906000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,
7906000	7909000	and we also appreciate five star reviews
7909000	7911000	on a place like iTunes or Google Play
7911000	7913000	or wherever it is you heard about this show.
7913000	7915000	Those go a long way,
7915000	7917000	and we really appreciate those reviews as well.
7917000	7918000	We don't ask for your money.
7918000	7920000	We just ask, hey, tell a friend about the show.
7920000	7921000	Help us spread the word,
7921000	7923000	because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
7923000	7926000	but only if the voices are here to actually air them out.
7926000	7929000	So, anyway, that's gonna do it for the show.
7929000	7932000	I guess now we will go around and give everybody's final thought.
7932000	7934000	Loki, you got the mic right there.
7934000	7935000	I'll start with you.
7935000	7941000	My final thought is I'm hopefully gonna work on my game this week.
7941000	7942000	I don't know.
7942000	7944000	It's been like it's however brain dead I am
7944000	7946000	after exercising and work in a whole day
7946000	7949000	and being that I'm starting my new job tomorrow.
7949000	7950000	Congrats.
7950000	7952000	We'll see how that goes
7952000	7955000	as far as what mental capacity I have left at the end of the day
7955000	7957000	to learn more about programming.
7957000	7961000	My final thought is, hopefully,
7961000	7963000	my eating noises have not been coming through on the microphone,
7963000	7966000	but I've been chewing on some popcorn throughout this movie,
7966000	7968000	or throughout the movie, throughout the show,
7968000	7971000	and I need to stop eating these popcorn kernels
7971000	7972000	because it's dangerous.
7972000	7973000	It's so terrible for your teeth.
7973000	7974000	But you know what is the best?
7974000	7976000	You know what's even better than popcorn
7976000	7978000	is those kernels that are like half popped.
7978000	7979000	Those are the best.
7979000	7982000	Somebody should figure out how to sell that.
7982000	7983000	You know what's the worst?
7983000	7984000	Half pop popcorn.
7984000	7985000	You know what's the worst?
7985000	7987000	Whenever I eat popcorn for some stupid reason,
7987000	7988000	you get one of those kernels
7988000	7991000	that just likes to get right in between your gums.
7991000	7992000	Oh, I have the solution for that.
7992000	7995000	I bought this thing for my teeth called a water pick,
7995000	7998000	and it was a good 60, 70 bucks on Amazon,
7998000	8000000	but you don't have to floss ever again
8000000	8002000	because that's what this thing is, is a floss thing.
8002000	8003000	You know what?
8003000	8004000	So you fill it up with water,
8004000	8005000	and it's like a water gun.
8005000	8007000	It's basically what your dentist will use on you,
8007000	8008000	like a lower version of that.
8008000	8010000	And so if I get popcorn stuck in my teeth,
8010000	8012000	I just go in the bathroom and just spread the word.
8012000	8013000	Well, that works if you're at home
8013000	8015000	when I'm stumbling eating popcorn at work.
8015000	8016000	I'm like, ah, current.
8016000	8017000	You know what?
8017000	8018000	I have something even cheaper than that.
8018000	8019000	It's a metal pick.
8019000	8021000	There you go.
8021000	8024000	Like a dentist pick, a real dentist pick.
8026000	8027000	All right.
8027000	8028000	And that fits in my purse.
8028000	8029000	Yeah, Causton says,
8029000	8032000	have you guys tried using those plastic brush picks?
8032000	8034000	Yeah, I used to use the little...
8034000	8035000	Things are a fucking waste of money.
8035000	8037000	The flossy pick things.
8037000	8038000	I used them.
8038000	8040000	But if I had a purse, I would put those in them.
8040000	8044000	You can get a legit narrow metal dentist pick.
8044000	8045000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8045000	8047000	And use that instead of floss.
8047000	8048000	Yeah.
8048000	8050000	And you pay two bucks for it.
8050000	8053000	And you can sterilize it and keep it with you.
8053000	8054000	As long as you sterilize it.
8054000	8056000	And you don't have to fucking pay for anything else.
8056000	8058000	Those things can get nasty if you don't sterilize it.
8058000	8061000	Well, yeah, but that's, again, why you sterilize.
8061000	8062000	It's boiling water.
8062000	8065000	In an emergency, you can gouge someone's eye out with it.
8065000	8066000	All right.
8066000	8067000	Anyway, Dark Sakura,
8067000	8069000	I don't want to leave without getting your final thought.
8069000	8071000	What is your final thought tonight?
8071000	8073000	Fuck it.
8073000	8074000	I like that.
8074000	8075000	We'll see you next week.
8075000	8078000	We will be back in seven days to do it all over again.
