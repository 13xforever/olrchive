0	2000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	12000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
13000	20000	This week we don't have a script, but we do have a lead. John Cena's gonna kick ass and chew bubblegum. But he's all out of gum.
20000	27000	This is just one story on tonight's show. Stay tuned for this, generational upgrades and plenty more news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Well hello once again everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	Orange Lounge Radio. Not live tonight with episode number 724 for this April the 1st of 2018.
45000	52000	And that is no joke. No joke here at OLR tonight, but it is gonna be a little bit of Orange Lounge Radio unplugged.
52000	56000	I'll get to that in a minute, but first I have to go around and introduce everybody.
56000	64000	Myself, I'm Rob Roberts or on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joined as always by my co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
64000	66000	Orange Dead Radio
66000	68000	Orange Dead, yes cause we're not live.
68000	70000	Exactly. Dead. I like that.
70000	71000	Dead Lounge Radio.
71000	74000	That would be the Halloween episode or episode 666 which we already did.
74000	76000	Yeah.
76000	78000	We hit the point where we've already passed episode 666.
78000	80000	We're beyond evil.
80000	82000	Beyond good and evil.
82000	85000	What would be the next big episode number?
85000	87000	777, the lucky sevens.
87000	89000	I guess so. I guess so. We'll be looking forward to that.
89000	91000	We've already had episode gonanami.
91000	94000	Yeah, I know. I know. They've all happened.
94000	97000	Anyway, also here tonight, of course, Techmaster Loki.
97000	99000	Hello.
99000	100000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
100000	101000	I'm fine.
101000	106000	Good. Alright, I'm gonna just ask you right at the top because I know somewhere out there, even though we're not live tonight, we don't have our chatters.
106000	112000	We don't have anything going on, which is weird. It's like a piece of us is missing tonight, but that's why it's OLR unplugged.
112000	118000	But I know if we did have the chat room going, Tigerclaw would be lighting it up going, Ready Player One, Ready Player One, Ready Player One.
118000	123000	I saw it. I saw it. Did you see it? Did you see it? So, Loki, I'm sure you had to go see it.
123000	125000	I had to go see it. It was awesome.
125000	127000	You didn't see it, right? Because I didn't see it.
127000	128000	No.
128000	129000	Alright, I didn't think so.
129000	130000	We were gonna go see it, right?
130000	137000	We can. He wanted to go tomorrow. I'm supposed to play Pokemon Go with Shane tomorrow, but I don't know how into that he is.
137000	139000	I'm gonna go be a drag nun, so.
139000	140000	Tomorrow? I thought it was Sunday.
140000	142000	I'm leaving Sunday because I'm staying with JD.
142000	144000	Oh, well tell that kid I said hi.
144000	145000	I will.
145000	147000	Alright, anyway, if he's not listening to this, then hi.
147000	149000	But JD's gonna have to put up with all of that makeup.
149000	152000	The bathroom's gonna be white by the time I'm done.
152000	155000	Girl, like it's the first time. Alright, anyway.
155000	159000	So alright, Ready Player One, the Loki review, and go.
159000	162000	Well, I mean, I really liked it. I knew I was gonna like it.
162000	163000	Of course you were.
163000	167000	And it didn't let me down. I thought, you know, if we're gonna say, you know, video game movies.
167000	175000	I think it did, um, there was definitely a lot of video game stuff in the movie. That's for sure.
175000	178000	I mean, cameos like crazy of everything.
178000	182000	Just, um, and I think it's just really well done.
182000	186000	I like how they incorporated a lot of even like Street Fighter was in there.
186000	188000	Um, they incorporated some of that stuff.
188000	193000	Um, you know, I like the changes that they made against the book and stuff.
193000	197000	Some people had issues with that. But honestly, if you're gonna do it exactly like the book.
197000	200000	Some of that would have been really boring to watch.
200000	204000	And that would have been something like if you were gonna stretch this out to like three movies or something.
204000	205000	That you could have probably done that.
205000	207000	But I kinda like how they did everything.
207000	212000	Let's, they have like, the thing that you see in the trailers all the time, like the big brace for the copper key.
212000	217000	Like that sequence right there, it's done with no music whatsoever.
217000	219000	It's just all sound effects.
219000	223000	And like, I couldn't stop grinning. It was just so fucking awesome.
223000	225000	Like Tron awesome? Cause that sounds like something out of Tron.
225000	229000	It was just like, just non-stop action.
229000	233000	Just non-stop, just crazy shit going on.
233000	237000	So I know the movie got like overall good on Rotten Tomatoes.
237000	241000	It seems like the feeling I'm getting on social media is kind of like, it's okay.
241000	244000	Yeah, it's like the book. It's like the book.
244000	245000	I mean, that's kinda like what it is.
245000	248000	The book was just, I liked the book. I really liked the book.
248000	255000	But some, you know, my wife who's more sophisticated when it comes to reading, didn't really care for it.
255000	257000	Because it's just kind of, it's like trivia about it.
257000	263000	It's like, the way I saw it compared to like, hey, you remember this? Hey, you remember that? Hey, you remember this?
263000	268000	It wasn't so much that in this. I mean, there was some things.
268000	272000	But they really kinda toned that down from the book.
273000	277000	I don't know, just like, I don't understand why this gets picked apart.
277000	284000	But like something like, Rampage the movie, you know, it's just, they expect it to be shit.
284000	285000	Did Rampage come out?
285000	286000	Yes, it's already out.
286000	287000	Oh, I'm...
287000	292000	No, no, no, no, I'm sorry. No, no, you're right. It's not out yet. It's coming out in a few weeks.
292000	294000	I haven't been paying attention.
294000	295000	Tomb Raider's out.
295000	297000	Yeah, Tomb Raider's out. They're putting it out a little bit.
297000	298000	Which didn't suck, but wasn't great.
298000	300000	Same thing. It was okay.
300000	303000	I think, I mean, this is just, it's a really excellent thing.
303000	307000	It's kind of, they have like, you know, not to get too much into spoilers and stuff,
307000	313000	but like the main guy Sorento in this, he wants to take over the Oasis because he wants to monetize it.
313000	315000	It's just like the fucking AAA industry.
315000	316000	He wants to mind it.
316000	317000	We're gonna put ads everywhere.
317000	320000	Like, they're talking about like, oh, hey, this is your VR view or whatever.
320000	325000	Sorry, I just have to say, even when I'm not live, the Google thing gets in the way. Sorry.
325000	326000	That's three weeks in a row, man.
326000	332000	Sorry, guys. God, I can't, I can't escape the Google chat noise sneaking onto the show.
332000	341000	So like they have like, you know, he's like, yeah, we figured out that it's gonna, we can fill up 82% of the viewers,
341000	346000	you know, field of view before they start having seizures is what they're gonna do.
346000	349000	And it's kind of like, yeah, that's kind of like where the industry is going.
349000	354000	So I was kind of neat to like tie in a little bit of like some of the, you know, current stuff.
354000	357000	Let me ask this real quick, though, like how many, since it is a gaming show, how many like,
357000	359000	is there a lot of video game references?
359000	363000	Like all over the, just all the time, just all over the fucking place.
363000	365000	So as a gamer, you felt very like fulfilled?
365000	366000	Yes, it's very fulfilling.
366000	371000	And like, even if you're not so much a gamer, so there's a, there's plenty of references to it.
371000	372000	It's not necessarily reference.
372000	377000	I would call them like cameos and like they incorporate a lot of stuff in there that's from different things.
377000	380000	The rendered characters look like they were straight out of a Final Fantasy game, though.
380000	383000	There's, well, I didn't see any Final Fantasy characters.
383000	390000	And I mean, granted, the last battle, the last battle scene, like you can't see everything.
390000	395000	Like it's just, there's so much going on that you're going to miss a ton of stuff.
395000	399000	But like there was, I remember spawn was in there, which is awesome.
399000	402000	I did see a cameo of Robocop in there at some point.
402000	407000	Apparently at the end of the, that the last charge you kind of see in the trailer,
407000	412000	they do have, you know, like Tracer and stuff from Overwatch, the Battletoads.
412000	415000	And apparently the Power Rangers are in there as well, like charging.
415000	421000	So I don't know. And then like the last like battle, which is kind of out of the book,
421000	428000	it's just, it's like, I don't want to spoil anything, but it's just like, dude, with that combination, you can't.
428000	431000	An orgy, an orgy of pop culture references.
431000	434000	And the end of the battle, Mr. Rogers in a bloodstain sweater.
434000	436000	Oh God, I hope that would, movie of the decade.
436000	439000	The ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny. Remember that, right?
439000	440000	Yes. Yes.
440000	441000	That's what it sounds like.
441000	442000	It's great.
442000	452000	No, but it's pretty awesome. And like, I like even like Sorrento's like avatar kind of looks like this bulked up evil Superman type guy,
452000	457000	which I don't know if he was like supposed to be like that, but he sort of looked like a Superman type guy.
457000	460000	Every time you say Sorrento, I think of Sargento and what pizza.
461000	463000	Pasta sauce. Do they make pasta sauce?
463000	465000	Yeah. Pasta sauce and cheese. They make cheese.
465000	472000	It was a good movie. I liked it. Um, there was, I don't know, there's not really much I could really pick apart about it.
472000	476000	I mean, it was definitely different than the book because they don't really,
476000	480000	well, the big part of the book was like you found the key and then you have to find the gate.
480000	483000	And so there was like a challenge to get to the gate as well.
483000	487000	This is more like you found the key. Okay, now here, open the gate. You know, it's like the gate's right there.
487000	490000	And then the gate's just to get a clue for the next thing.
490000	494000	You know, it's so they don't really kind of address that too much.
494000	498000	Um, but I liked it. I thought it was a great movie. It's definitely worth seeing.
498000	503000	And I saw it, I saw it in 3D and in the D box with the motion seats and stuff. That was fucking awesome.
503000	507000	I forget the motion box is the thing cause I haven't seen a single movie and that's just Tron.
507000	513000	Tron was eight years ago, or like seven and a half. It was, oh my God, I can't believe how like long ago that was.
513000	515000	Anyway, uh, we do want to get into the rest of the show tonight.
515000	522000	Um, before we get too far though, let me tell you what's going on in case you have somehow missed this announcement in previous episodes.
522000	524000	So maybe it's your first Orange Lounge Radio. You never know.
524000	528000	Uh, there's people that find us through friends or other methods every week, so hi.
528000	533000	Uh, it's a little different tonight. This is Orange Lounge Radio unplugged because we are not live.
533000	538000	We usually are live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geeks Network.
538000	541000	vog.network.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
541000	546000	But this week, April 1st, a little bit different because it's also Easter.
546000	549000	And so we all have Easter family plans, actually.
549000	553000	Even though mine are in the morning, you guys are in the evening and, you know, Jamie's all the way out in San Francisco.
553000	556000	So it's just not going to gel together on April 1st.
556000	558000	I'm going to have a very, very gay Easter.
558000	563000	That's, I'm kind of jealous. Anyway, um, so, uh, but here's the thing.
563000	568000	Usually we would just take the night off, but we just had last Sunday off because my fault, I was out of town.
568000	572000	Well, really Bobby Black Wolf's fault because he had to go and get married.
572000	574000	But I will say, I'm sure-
574000	575000	It's so overrated.
575000	581000	I'm sure this is going to come up on his show because, um, I'm still going to do the call live on Sunday and I'm sure it'll get brought up.
581000	585000	But I do want to just, you know, again, congratulate Bobby and Jennifer Black Wolf on their, on their wedding.
585000	589000	And, uh, yes, there were lots of great nerdy references in it.
589000	592000	Uh, walk down the aisle to the theme from Final Fantasy.
592000	593000	Cool.
593000	595000	Uh, I remember Kingdom Hearts came up too at some point.
595000	600000	Other nerdy things like Star Wars and like Weird Al kicked off the, the dance.
600000	602000	Although, speaking of the dance, I will say this about Bobby's wedding.
602000	603000	Did he have a polka?
603000	606000	He, Bobby, no, it wasn't, it was a tacky, you know?
606000	607000	Yeah.
607000	610000	But anyway, uh, I will say this about Bobby's wedding because this was a nerdy reference.
610000	611000	So good.
611000	614000	I didn't even catch it until like Jennifer said, did you, did you notice that?
614000	616000	And I was like, oh my God, you did.
616000	618000	Oh my God, you totally did do that.
618000	625000	So they did this whole thing, like when it was time for them to do the first dance and Bobby kind of like said, oh no, no, no, we weren't going to do that.
625000	626000	Remember?
626000	627000	Like he's, no, no, no.
627000	630000	And he's walking up to the DJ and I'm thinking like, oh, this is really awkward.
630000	631000	Right.
631000	637000	And then all of a sudden, like Jennifer kind of like pulls him in and the song starts and of course he's like super into it and they do this whole choreographed thing.
637000	644000	They did the fucking scene from Final Fantasy 8, the ballroom dance scene, and they did the whole, where she pulls him in and all.
644000	646000	So that was, it was all part of it.
646000	649000	And then like, I know there's video of it somewhere cause there was a camera upstairs.
649000	656000	So I kind of go from that whole like, oh no, like, oh dear, something's going on to that whole like this bitch.
656000	657000	Yeah.
657000	660000	Like when they get into the whole like thing, but it was, it was fantastic.
660000	666000	I was like, you could probably even see me in the video mouthing to Alan, what a ham.
666000	667000	But it was great.
667000	668000	It was so good.
668000	673000	And I love that it was a traditional wedding, but very peppered with nerdy references.
673000	674000	Like Ready Player One.
674000	675000	It was peppered with nerdy references.
675000	678000	I was more excited by that Katamari cake though.
678000	680000	It was, sadly we didn't get to eat it.
680000	683000	I guess the groom's cake is not necessarily something you eat at the wedding.
683000	684000	That's dumb.
684000	685000	It's cake.
685000	688000	Well, I had never heard of the groom's cake tradition before this wedding.
688000	690000	Cause it's a Southern thing apparently.
690000	693000	I had never heard of it, but yeah, he did have a cake and it's on my Instagram.
693000	698000	It's on his Twitter, but the cake looked like a giant Katamari, which was very well done.
698000	702000	But the best part about it, it was rolling up things that were like Bobby.
702000	707000	It was like a microphone and a VR headset and like the, and I thought, oh my God, I love that.
707000	708000	I love that.
708000	711000	So, but we did get to eat like the cake cake.
711000	714000	I don't think you'd really call it the bride's cake, but the cake cake.
714000	715000	It was really fucking good.
715000	717000	It was good.
717000	719000	And like, I did not realize this is a thing I learned.
719000	721000	You know, Bobby and I, we do have a lot in common.
721000	723000	We're both longtime internet broadcasters, right?
723000	727000	Uh, but one thing I did not realize we have in common, we both love red velvet.
727000	730000	And so did you just roll your eyes at me?
730000	733000	It's just chocolate, but they dye it red.
733000	734000	No, it's different.
734000	735000	It's different.
735000	740000	True red velvet cake is, is a very, very chocolate cake that shines red when the sun hits it.
740000	742000	It was, it was good.
742000	744000	Well, I mean, the cake was three layers.
744000	747000	So obviously I had the red velvet layer and I'm pretty sure he did too.
747000	748000	And it was fantastic.
748000	750000	So anyway, congratulations, Bobby.
750000	753000	But that's why we weren't here last Sunday live because I did take the trip out to Georgia to do it.
753000	759000	You know what, Bobby, I've, God, I would, Bobby I've known because of this show.
759000	766000	And, you know, obviously he led to the partnership that saved us from live through CC5 when they were kind of imploding and then brought us to the all games.
766000	771000	And then obviously we created VOG, you know, together, you know, with, with our buddies.
771000	778000	And so, God, Bobby's somebody I've worked with and gone to expos, E3 packs, all that stuff over for like 10 years, over 10 years.
778000	785000	So I was very honored that he, he shared in a special day with me, but I will stop talking about that.
785000	790000	Since again, I'm sure the folks that are listening on Sunday night are like, we just heard this on Bobby's show, but it was a great night, y'all.
790000	791000	It was a great night.
791000	793000	Let's just, so this is unplugged.
793000	796000	It's also unplugged because we don't have a show roll.
796000	800000	Usually we have a list like Jamie's going to talk about this and then Loki's going to talk about this.
800000	804000	Like we don't script the show, but we have like, we have a flow chart of how the show is going to look, right?
804000	806000	We didn't do that this week.
806000	807000	PowerPoint presentation.
807000	812000	We don't have our chat room, which means if we get something wrong tonight, we're not going to be instantly corrected.
812000	813000	Deal with it.
813000	815000	Yeah. You'll just have to send us an email to participate.
815000	817000	Anything wrong is an April Fool's joke.
817000	820000	That's right. Very good. Very good. Anything wrong is April Fool's.
820000	821000	It was intentional.
821000	823000	Got you good. All right.
823000	827000	Let's get into our gaming weeks. Why don't we start off talking about that?
827000	830000	We usually do at the top of the show, talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
830000	831000	Dark Sakura.
831000	839000	Since I'm better at reading maps than my husband, I've been his navigator in Breath of the Wild again in our quest to get every single shrine.
839000	840000	We were on the last shrine.
840000	841000	Wow.
841000	844000	The one where you use the giant ball in Impa's house.
844000	848000	I haven't played enough of Breath of the Wild to find them all.
848000	849000	Girl.
849000	850000	Girl.
850000	853000	I need to go back and really like play that game thoroughly.
853000	861000	Well, we were on the last one and then I told Dan that our next quest is to get all 900 Koroks. We have 120.
861000	862000	Oh boy.
862000	870000	Well, you only need 400 and something to fill your inventory to get all the inventory slots, but we're going for completion.
870000	875000	We're doing like everything. Poor Zelda's, they're like, bitch, hurry up in that castle.
876000	890000	And then I'm still playing idle pouring. I'm still playing animal crossing. We've got more animals. It's actually really fun.
890000	891000	Are they still updating the mobile?
891000	899000	Yeah, they're still updating it like different things to do every month. Different ways to get your money.
899000	902000	I don't want to say that game flopped because I know it has its fans.
902000	903000	It didn't flop at all.
903000	906000	But well, but it also didn't hit expectations. I know I've seen that.
906000	908000	Well, I'm helping it hit expectations.
908000	912000	But I mean, I was actually going to say a positive, Jamie, if you let me finish.
912000	920000	The positive was going to be, but they're still updating it. They're still doing all these tweaks to it that I'm just I'm just not hearing about because for whatever reason, it just doesn't have the same.
920000	923000	I just want a full animal crossing on Switch.
923000	925000	I think you and half the Internet.
925000	926000	Right. Yeah.
926000	933000	And so I've been, you know, living my Animal Crossing fantasy vicariously through, you know, the little teensy Animal Crossing.
933000	937000	Sure. But it's been really fun. I'm super enjoying it.
937000	943000	I've started playing Puzzle Bobble again, the phone version, because it's all I have time for anymore.
943000	951000	I haven't touched Wow, which is sad. I probably should. But I need people to play with.
951000	956000	Hey, Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick from Game Buoy, you out there?
956000	961000	They would be on the server when I am. But.
961000	967000	It's a bummer. It is a bummer about the regional stuff, because I bet the girls gone wow team would love to have you.
967000	972000	And it's a it's a bummer about the whole fact that you can't play with UK people.
972000	973000	Yeah, it is.
973000	987000	But I've I've you know, I've been thinking about putting some time into that once I get some of my responsibilities out of the way, because I even tonight after I go to the movies, I'm supposed to work on, you know, graphic stuff.
987000	993000	But that's been the predominant thing is really I've just been like we've all been about Breath of the Wild at my house.
993000	998000	Oh, and and and and I played a shit ton of World Cup soccer pinball.
998000	1002000	Pinball machine. Yeah, I saw your Instagram lighten up because you replaced a part, right?
1002000	1009000	Well, Dan hosted League Night. There's there's two leagues in Sacramento. There's the Folsom League and the Lodi League.
1009000	1011000	What's league like like pinball league?
1011000	1013000	Oh, I know there was a pinball league. That's cool.
1013000	1020000	And I think that we had the Lodi League at our house on.
1020000	1027000	Not this past Thursday, but last week, huh? And like 24 people in the house, so I just went and bought clothes.
1027000	1030000	I'm down another gene size. Hey, hey, work.
1030000	1037000	Anyway, so we they broke my goalie on World Cup soccer.
1037000	1045000	And the goalie is actually a hard plastic that's mounted to a another metal piece and it moves back and forth.
1045000	1048000	You can still do the metal piece, but the goalie is a little bit bigger.
1048000	1052000	It's just a big hunk of plastic. And they broke my goalie off of the post.
1052000	1059000	And so Dan ordered me another goalie, but he jury rigged my my old goalie so that we could still play the table.
1059000	1065000	And he's put all kinds of LEDs in it. And he's finished Creature from the Black Lagoon, which he we sold one once.
1065000	1071000	And he always wanted another. So he shopped it out. And now we have the getaway, which was high speed to.
1071000	1075000	Yeah, I remember that. I actually remember that we have like so many Steve Ritchie tables.
1075000	1079000	It's not even funny. High speed was one of the NES games, right? Like everybody knows him.
1079000	1083000	I think so. They also did high speed. High speed was the one where you play as the cops.
1083000	1087000	Well, the getaway is where you play as the guy in the Ferrari.
1087000	1096000	And so it's another Steve Ritchie game, which the Steve Ritchie games, like, for example, there's Black Knight 2000 is a Steve Ritchie game.
1096000	1102000	You know, the getaway, the new Star Trek pinball is a Steve Ritchie game and the new Star Wars one.
1102000	1107000	I think he did that one, too. But he does really fast ones with like the button in the middle gimmick.
1107000	1111000	And so I guess we've become Steve Ritchie collectors.
1111000	1118000	And he's also a super nice guy, just, you know, going very deaf. But he's really, really just a cool guy.
1118000	1124000	And so we've been doing a lot of pinball lately, just, you know, Dan shopping out.
1124000	1128000	We might be selling Star Trek maybe because we need room.
1128000	1131000	That's part of what you got to do. Buy, sell, trade.
1131000	1140000	And my coworker and buddy Tyler, who changed roommate, went to L.A. and brought me back to new games.
1140000	1149000	Well, new-ish, you know, new to me. I have now Puyo Puyo Dreamcast edition, Puyo Puyo 4 for Dreamcast.
1149000	1153000	And I have Puyo Puyo Sun 64, which I wanted since that fucking game came out.
1153000	1157000	And now I have it in a very nice box. It's really nice.
1157000	1158000	Awesome.
1158000	1161000	And but I'm still working on finding something for Dan.
1161000	1169000	So if anyone has any leads on a copy of Salamander Deluxe Pack for Sega Saturn for hopefully under 60 bucks, let me know.
1169000	1170000	OK.
1170000	1171000	So that's it.
1171000	1172000	All right.
1172000	1176000	And as the collecting world turns of the vault to Dark Saga's house.
1176000	1179000	Well, we might be selling off some of the stuff in there, but the Saturn collection.
1179000	1182000	You're still trying to unload that Ninja Gaiden trilogy, huh?
1182000	1189000	We haven't really put much effort into it, but if someone wants to make me an offer on Ninja Gaiden trilogy, if it's under $300, I'm going to laugh at you.
1189000	1190000	All right.
1190000	1192000	It's in the box with a manual.
1192000	1196000	All right. Let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week? What have you been playing?
1196000	1201000	I've been playing a few things, so I got Far Cry 5 because I was peer pressured by my.
1201000	1205000	Well, it's not peer pressured, but I like at least to get the PlayStation 4 version.
1205000	1210000	I was peer pressured because they're like, you just get a PlayStation 4, then maybe we can play.
1210000	1212000	And I was like, OK, fine.
1212000	1215000	Because I wasn't decided between PlayStation 4 or PC.
1215000	1217000	And I like Far Cry games. They're all right.
1217000	1220000	And I usually get tired of them pretty fast, but the Far Cry arcade was pretty fun.
1220000	1223000	So that's kind of the level creator that they have in there.
1223000	1224000	So I've been messing with that a little bit.
1224000	1229000	It's still kind of limited for what I wanted to make, but I could have quite a bit of fun with that.
1229000	1232000	And then the actual game itself.
1232000	1235000	OK, so there's this weird glitch that happened.
1235000	1241000	So I was playing the game on normal, and then all of a sudden I'm in the tutorial.
1241000	1243000	I thought of Bobby for a second there.
1243000	1245000	I was like, I can't pass the tutorial.
1245000	1247000	I keep getting shot to death.
1247000	1250000	And I'm doing everything right. Why do I keep dying so fast?
1250000	1256000	Well, apparently there's a glitch in the game that all of a sudden randomly sets it up to hard mode.
1256000	1259000	It just ramps it up all the way.
1259000	1261000	And I was like, what the hell?
1261000	1263000	And so I put it all back down the easy.
1263000	1265000	And I was like, OK, that's way better now.
1265000	1267000	Now I can actually survive.
1267000	1272000	But I posted on Twitter, and apparently Travis had the same problem.
1272000	1274000	He's like, yeah, that happened to me too.
1274000	1275000	I was like, that's weird.
1275000	1279000	But yeah, the game is all sorts of glitchy bullshit, which means I love it.
1280000	1282000	So there's that.
1282000	1286000	And then I was actually trying to get some actual programming done.
1286000	1293000	So I've been doing a lot of stuff, though, for work and doing stuff for something I wanted to work on.
1293000	1298000	But it's more of education still, because I wanted to do a third-person shooter.
1298000	1303000	But who would have thought it's so much fucking harder than a first-person shooter?
1304000	1309000	So speaking of work, a little birdie named the Twitter icon told me that you got a promotion.
1309000	1311000	Yes, I did get a promotion.
1311000	1314000	A nice 25% raise too.
1314000	1315000	That's special.
1315000	1316000	You got money.
1316000	1325000	Yeah, so I've been trying to get into this specific position ever since I got up to where I'm at now,
1325000	1327000	because it seemed like it was really cool.
1327000	1330000	It's basically people that it's sort of like an analyst position,
1330000	1334000	but it's basically finding efficiencies and implementing that stuff.
1334000	1336000	Oh, like business improvement stuff.
1336000	1338000	Yeah, so workflow stuff.
1338000	1340000	A lot of that is tied to training, so I'm very familiar with that.
1340000	1342000	Yeah, exactly. So workflow stuff.
1342000	1344000	And that's kind of what I do anyways.
1344000	1349000	Any position I go to, I kind of master it, and I find shortcuts that do everything faster.
1349000	1355000	And so that's how I've gotten great reviews the last couple of years, just because of that kind of stuff.
1356000	1359000	I started teaching myself JavaScript.
1359000	1363000	Well, first I started off with Visual Basic scripting to do macros and stuff,
1363000	1368000	and now since I'm moving out of Internet Explorer, because no one should be in Internet Explorer.
1368000	1376000	But I wanted to move away from that, so now I'm learning JavaScript to develop a Chrome extension
1376000	1383000	to work with the stuff I have, because we use a database system, I guess.
1383000	1387000	We call it Salesforce. A lot of big companies use it, Microsoft and stuff like that.
1387000	1389000	Isn't it built on an Oracle?
1389000	1396000	It's something. I don't know what it is. It's basically a database of contacts and stuff.
1396000	1398000	They use it for sales.
1398000	1402000	I know Salesforce very well, and I know other people that know it very, very well.
1402000	1405000	It's very popular in the industry.
1405000	1408000	Yes, there's lots of people that use Salesforce.
1409000	1415000	What we wanted to do, there's different quality of life things that obviously aren't going to be at the forefront
1415000	1418000	for our programs to work on, because we just integrated.
1418000	1421000	We moved away from a terminal system into Salesforce,
1421000	1427000	and so I've been using the extension to build those quality of life functions on the client side
1427000	1431000	to do all the things that they want to do, since we don't have to bug the programs.
1431000	1433000	I can just take care of it myself.
1433000	1435000	It's like, oh, I want this button to do this and this and this.
1435000	1440000	So in a roundabout way, all this programming stuff for the games you've never done
1440000	1442000	have actually kind of helped you out.
1442000	1446000	Yeah, sort of. It helps me learn different languages a lot quicker, so that's good.
1446000	1449000	No, but I really do want to get into making games.
1449000	1455000	I have been inspired, but the third-person shooter stuff, it seems like it's a lot to learn.
1455000	1460000	I mean, it's just with the animation systems and stuff like that, but it's good to learn it, though,
1460000	1465000	because it's an important part of doing all these different things in Unity and stuff.
1465000	1471000	So it's good to kind of learn that now instead of just going around different ways of doing things.
1471000	1475000	So I've been kind of in just a learning phase, and it's been fascinating.
1475000	1479000	So once I kind of get that down, then I'll start working on some other things.
1479000	1482000	And I don't even know if the third-person shooter thing is what I'm going to end up doing,
1482000	1486000	but it's just more of just educating myself, especially since the last time I used Unity
1486000	1490000	was kind of getting into the five, and now it's 2017, and a ton of shit has changed.
1490000	1494000	So it's just kind of figuring out what all the changes are.
1494000	1496000	All right, anything else for your gaming week?
1496000	1502000	A little bit of Pokémon, because they have that new quest system thing, so that's been fun.
1502000	1504000	Yeah, that just started the day we're recording, yeah.
1504000	1511000	Yeah, so I've been playing that a little bit, and then I've been...
1511000	1516000	What else? I played a little bit of Burnout Paradise Remastered, and that's all right.
1516000	1522000	Kind of sad that they just dropped the price $10, like literally a week after it came out.
1522000	1524000	Oh wow, I didn't even realize that.
1524000	1527000	But I... whatever, it's fine.
1527000	1530000	So I don't know, I'm just going to be playing stuff.
1530000	1537000	I've kind of settled on the fact that I'm probably not going to buy any new games until the fall.
1537000	1541000	But at the same time, I'm thinking, hey, you know, I just got this new job,
1541000	1544000	maybe I should reward myself with a Switch, so we'll see.
1544000	1550000	I bought two games, actually. One of them I haven't played yet, but I just bought it today.
1550000	1552000	Have you ever heard of Leo's Fortune?
1552000	1553000	Nope.
1553000	1557000	It's a little platformer where you play as a green, fuzzy, Muppet-looking ball.
1557000	1560000	But it got good ratings. It's really pretty.
1560000	1561000	Cool.
1561000	1565000	And another one called Human Fall Flat.
1565000	1567000	That I've seen, yeah.
1567000	1571000	Yeah, I got that one, but I haven't, again, played it yet, but it looks really neat, so...
1571000	1576000	I'm trying to do more, like, Mac gaming, because someone's gotta.
1576000	1580000	Someone's gotta be the audience for that.
1580000	1584000	But both of them are really high-rated, so I decided to give them a try.
1584000	1586000	I'm going to do my gaming week then.
1586000	1592000	I was traveling most of the time, so I don't have as many games, although I did bring my Switch,
1592000	1595000	and so I did play some Mario Kart 8 while we had some downtime,
1595000	1600000	because I noticed Sunday night there was nothing to do, so I played some Mario Kart 8
1600000	1604000	and some Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 and a few things on Switch there.
1604000	1609000	But actually, just a little while ago, I was doing some streaming of Ni No Kuni 2.
1609000	1611000	I started playing Ni No Kuni 2.
1611000	1612000	How is it?
1612000	1614000	It's not bad, and it's not tied to the first one.
1614000	1617000	It does feel like a different game in the same universe,
1617000	1620000	because I noticed right off the bat the combat is completely different.
1620000	1627000	It's more like Kingdom Hearts type of combat than it is a normal RPG where it's like fight, attack, run.
1627000	1631000	You run up, you can dodge, and it's more action-y kind of based.
1631000	1635000	So I don't think you have to have a knowledge of the first game, really,
1635000	1641000	although I did notice some of the location names are the same, so it must be in the same world,
1641000	1643000	although I've only played the first chapter.
1643000	1646000	I've barely scratched the surface, so not all of that's come together yet.
1646000	1649000	But I was doing some streaming of that earlier on my channel, Rob Roberts, on Twitch,
1649000	1653000	so I was encouraged to play more, so I'll definitely play some more.
1653000	1656000	It is a really good-looking game. It looks really nice.
1656000	1658000	I bought it on PC, actually.
1658000	1660000	I know most people are probably doing it on PlayStation 4.
1660000	1663000	I felt for streaming it would probably be easier on PC,
1663000	1670000	and then also I knew PC can run it at some higher resolutions than maybe what I can get away with on my TV.
1670000	1674000	So yeah, I just decided to get it on PC, and I've been enjoying the game so far,
1674000	1676000	so I'm hoping to play more in the coming week.
1676000	1680000	And again, if you want to watch me play, you can over at Twitch TV, Rob Roberts.
1680000	1684000	Speaking of Twitch, I've been playing with my buddy Delvin.
1684000	1688000	Shout-out to Delvin, who's one of the hosts of the Video Game Realness podcast,
1688000	1692000	which they're still putting out new episodes out of Toronto,
1692000	1696000	and we were teaming up playing Overwatch together.
1696000	1700000	So sometimes I will stream it, like we'll both be streaming it,
1700000	1702000	and sometimes he streams it, and I'm just like,
1702000	1705000	Delvin, I'm going to join your game. He's like, okay, so I end up on his stream.
1705000	1708000	So I've been playing a little more Overwatch because of that,
1708000	1711000	which is one of those games I haven't been playing a lot of lately.
1711000	1714000	But there's a little more renewed interest in Overwatch right now
1714000	1716000	because they just put out Brigitte, the new character,
1716000	1718000	so it's changed the dynamics a little bit.
1718000	1721000	So that's fun. I haven't really played a lot of her.
1721000	1724000	I've still been sticking to the characters that I'm decent with.
1724000	1729000	I play usually Junkrat. I play Pharah. I play Orisa.
1729000	1731000	If the group needs a tank, I really enjoy Orisa.
1731000	1733000	Do you do tongue pops?
1735000	1736000	When I do Orisa?
1736000	1737000	Yeah.
1737000	1738000	Yes. God!
1740000	1741000	What's her catchphrase?
1741000	1747000	So you play Orisa Edwards and Farah Moan.
1747000	1749000	Cease your resistance!
1750000	1752000	I messed up the tongue pop.
1752000	1753000	I couldn't help it.
1753000	1756000	Let's see. And then what do I do if I need a healer?
1756000	1758000	I'm a pretty decent Mercy.
1758000	1761000	I still play Mercy, even though they keep thwappin' her with the nerf bat,
1761000	1762000	but I still enjoy Mercy.
1762000	1765000	I sometimes play Lucio, but I think I'm just better with Mercy.
1765000	1768000	So yeah, that's a little Overwatch,
1768000	1770000	and I guess that's really all I have to say,
1770000	1773000	except I will quickly mention the Pokemon Go things since you brought it up.
1773000	1775000	The questing is rad.
1775000	1777000	If you haven't played Pokemon Go in a while,
1777000	1780000	fire it up because it's cool.
1780000	1783000	Now you have two types of quests, basically.
1783000	1786000	One of them are little daily things you get from bogey stops.
1786000	1788000	The other one is kind of like this set adventure
1788000	1792000	that is going to culminate in the ability to capture Mew, basically.
1792000	1795000	But what's cool about it is that some of the quest rewards
1795000	1797000	is not only another way to get XP
1797000	1800000	and get some of the stuff you would usually get from raids,
1800000	1802000	but you can actually get XP as well,
1802000	1805000	so people that need more experience, this is a good way to do it.
1805000	1807000	And it does throttle you.
1807000	1809000	You can only do so much in one day,
1809000	1812000	but I got an incubator as the reward today for doing quests,
1812000	1814000	and I was like, okay.
1814000	1817000	I always complain about how fast you tear through those incubators,
1817000	1819000	and then it's just like, buy more, buy more,
1819000	1821000	and you know that's how they're making all their money,
1821000	1824000	so I appreciate that there's ways to get free ones now in the game.
1824000	1826000	They used to have it, though.
1826000	1829000	You can sometimes get them from bogey stops.
1829000	1831000	Around Christmas, I think.
1831000	1833000	Was it only at Christmas?
1833000	1835000	I feel like they might have done it twice in the game.
1835000	1838000	There was a couple-day period where every day you spun a bogey stop,
1838000	1841000	you got one one-using incubator.
1841000	1842000	Yeah, that's what I like.
1842000	1843000	They did that for a bit, yeah.
1843000	1845000	Yeah, so I think it was around the holidays.
1845000	1849000	So anyway, that is pretty much it for my gaming week.
1849000	1853000	So we will be back live next week, April the 8th,
1853000	1854000	so we will see you then,
1854000	1856000	and then we should have shows pretty consistently
1856000	1862000	until the end of June, the week after our 16th anniversary special.
1862000	1863000	My God.
1863000	1868000	This show will be old enough to drive right into a brick wall,
1868000	1869000	as we do every week.
1869000	1871000	Well, in Mississippi, we were already old enough.
1871000	1872000	That's right.
1872000	1875000	You might even be able to get married in certain states.
1875000	1876000	That's right.
1876000	1880000	Are we able to legally consent anywhere yet?
1880000	1881000	Other countries.
1881000	1882000	All right, anyway.
1882000	1884000	I don't know, it would be old enough in Italy.
1884000	1886000	Let's get to some gaming news.
1886000	1887000	Again, we're unplugged tonight,
1887000	1889000	so I have no idea what we're going to talk about.
1889000	1890000	Let's start with Jamie.
1890000	1892000	Throw a story at us, yeah.
1892000	1895000	I'm busy updating my Mac, hush.
1895000	1897000	So it's a game I actually,
1897000	1899000	I didn't even know that it was out on iOS,
1899000	1901000	so I just acquired it today.
1901000	1906000	But Puzzle Fighter has actually gotten a rating for PS4,
1906000	1908000	Xbox One, and PC in Europe,
1908000	1913000	and it is a translation of the iOS and Google Play version.
1913000	1916000	So from their little...
1916000	1918000	Well, we don't know that for sure, though, right?
1918000	1919000	We just know the game's been rated.
1919000	1920000	We don't know if it's...
1920000	1921000	Well, yeah, but it's likely...
1921000	1923000	Because it's not super Puzzle Fighter.
1923000	1925000	Well, yeah, I guess what I mean by that is
1925000	1927000	we don't know if it's going to be the free-to-play model
1927000	1930000	or if you'll get a bundle all at once.
1930000	1932000	Well, the free-to-play model that's out right now
1932000	1935000	for its basic features is that you can collect characters,
1935000	1938000	you can challenge people all over the world in real-time fighting,
1938000	1940000	you have all kinds of Capcom characters,
1940000	1942000	you get ranking points,
1942000	1945000	you can do world leader board PvP,
1945000	1948000	and it's basically just Puzzle Fighter,
1948000	1951000	which is funny because I knew two of the people
1951000	1955000	who did localization for Puzzle Fighter in the U.S.
1955000	1956000	Oh, cool.
1956000	1957000	The original Puzzle Fighter.
1957000	1960000	If I am... Well, actually, was it Puzzle...
1960000	1961000	No, it was Rival...
1961000	1963000	I think it was Puzzle Fighter and Rival Schools.
1963000	1964000	That was Chris Tang.
1964000	1965000	Oh.
1965000	1966000	It was in DDR.
1966000	1967000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1967000	1968000	Cool guy.
1968000	1971000	Beat the shit out of my husband in Street Fighter.
1971000	1973000	The thing I remember about Puzzle Fighter,
1973000	1975000	I didn't play the mobile one very long
1975000	1978000	because you know how I feel about playing games
1978000	1980000	that I need a controller for on mobile.
1980000	1982000	And that is one of those games.
1982000	1984000	So I'm excited to hear I will get to try it
1984000	1985000	with a controller with this.
1985000	1987000	But one thing I liked about it was that it wasn't just
1987000	1989000	the Street Fighter and Darkstalkers,
1989000	1991000	but they were putting things like Dante
1991000	1992000	and like other Capcom...
1992000	1993000	Frank West, who's in everything.
1993000	1995000	Yeah, other Capcom classic greats.
1995000	1997000	He needs something to do since his series is dead.
1997000	1999000	Yeah, that's too bad, huh?
1999000	2000000	I bet you that series comes back.
2000000	2002000	It's dead, rising.
2002000	2005000	It will rise from its grave.
2005000	2006000	Rise from your grave.
2006000	2007000	Rise from your grave.
2007000	2010000	It will come out again, I'm sure, at some point.
2011000	2014000	To register participation for this week's episode
2014000	2017000	of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.
2017000	2019000	Use the passphrase, graphic.
2020000	2022000	Reboots, that's what we do in entertainment.
2022000	2023000	Remasters.
2023000	2024000	Remaster, reboots.
2024000	2026000	Oh, a trilogy remaster.
2026000	2027000	Why the fuck not?
2027000	2028000	Let's do it.
2028000	2030000	Everything else is getting a trilogy remaster.
2030000	2033000	All right, Loki, we'll bounce back and forth here.
2033000	2035000	I don't have anything else.
2035000	2036000	All right.
2036000	2037000	I'll just direct traffic.
2037000	2039000	Let's find something interesting to talk about.
2039000	2041000	Well, since we were just talking about Capcom,
2041000	2042000	we can talk about, I guess,
2042000	2043000	the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Edition.
2043000	2044000	Oh, sure.
2044000	2046000	So, yeah, that's gonna be pre-ordering on PC,
2046000	2048000	PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
2048000	2049000	And if you pre-order it,
2049000	2052000	you get Ultra Street Fighter IV for free.
2052000	2054000	And then Switch, of course,
2054000	2056000	since Ultra Street Fighter IV wasn't on there,
2056000	2058000	you get the Super Street Fighter II,
2058000	2060000	the tournament battle.
2060000	2061000	Hmm.
2061000	2063000	So, it's pretty awesome.
2064000	2065000	Except for the fact that I already have
2065000	2067000	that Ultra Street Fighter IV on PC, but...
2067000	2069000	But it has a meaning.
2069000	2071000	It's got Street Fighter, Street Fighter II,
2071000	2072000	Street Fighter II Championship Edition,
2072000	2074000	Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting,
2074000	2075000	Super Street Fighter II,
2075000	2076000	Super Street Fighter II Turbo,
2076000	2077000	Street Fighter Alpha,
2077000	2079000	Alpha II, Alpha III,
2079000	2080000	Street Fighter III,
2080000	2082000	III Second Impact.
2082000	2084000	Street Fighter 33 and a third.
2084000	2085000	Everything up until fourth.
2085000	2087000	I don't see any of those bootleg ones.
2087000	2089000	Where's the Black Belt Edition, dammit?
2089000	2091000	I want to be able to throw rapid-fire fireballs
2091000	2093000	and have them wave up and down.
2093000	2095000	Where's the one that did all the urban legend shit
2095000	2098000	where, like, you could stick Vega to the wall
2098000	2100000	and you could handcuff somebody to Guile?
2100000	2102000	True story.
2102000	2104000	Arcade that I used to go to in college
2104000	2106000	that was actually in the back of a bar
2106000	2111000	had all those bootleg modded ones,
2111000	2112000	including Immortal Combat
2112000	2114000	that started off with the last fight.
2114000	2115000	Oh, weird.
2115000	2117000	Yeah, but I've seen some of those,
2117000	2119000	like, urban legend editions,
2119000	2120000	the ROM hacked ones.
2120000	2122000	They're pretty funny.
2122000	2123000	Yeah, where, like, somebody will be like,
2123000	2125000	no, I swear I saw it once.
2125000	2127000	Guile handcuffs somebody to him.
2127000	2128000	Like, it's a move you can do.
2128000	2130000	And it's like, well, because you saw some bootleg
2130000	2131000	from another country.
2131000	2133000	But back then we weren't aware of,
2133000	2134000	we were naive to such things.
2134000	2135000	We could have the internet.
2135000	2136000	Yeah, that's right.
2136000	2137000	There was no Snopes.
2137000	2138000	We barely had the internet.
2138000	2139000	That's right.
2139000	2140000	Get off my lawn.
2140000	2141000	All right.
2141000	2142000	Well, that'd be cool.
2142000	2143000	I mean, we talked a little bit about
2143000	2144000	the Street Fighter thing last week
2144000	2145000	or the week before, I don't remember,
2145000	2147000	about the whole, like, the tournament.
2147000	2148000	And that must be the thing
2148000	2149000	that they're putting on the Switch,
2149000	2151000	but that's cool about the pre-order bonuses.
2151000	2153000	I mean, like, if you somehow missed
2153000	2154000	Ultra Street Fighter IV,
2154000	2155000	which I don't...
2155000	2157000	Street Fighter IV feels so much like
2157000	2158000	Street Fighter II to me,
2158000	2160000	because, like, all the Street Fighter II characters
2160000	2161000	are in Street Fighter IV.
2161000	2162000	Yeah.
2162000	2163000	Every single one of them.
2163000	2164000	The last good one.
2164000	2165000	Yeah.
2165000	2166000	So, anyway.
2166000	2168000	You weren't a fan of Street Fighter V?
2168000	2170000	Apparently not a lot of people were.
2170000	2171000	Well, I don't know.
2171000	2173000	I want to give it a second chance
2173000	2174000	of this arcade edition.
2174000	2176000	My girl's in it.
2176000	2177000	Dan played a little bit of it.
2177000	2178000	It was actually not too bad.
2178000	2179000	Yeah.
2179000	2181000	I only care because I can play soccer right now.
2181000	2182000	I want to give it another look.
2182000	2184000	Anyway, what do you have for us, Jamie?
2184000	2186000	Some Dragon Quest stuff.
2186000	2187000	Because, guess what?
2187000	2188000	It's not 9.
2188000	2189000	It's 11.
2189000	2190000	Sorry.
2190000	2191000	That was from before the show.
2191000	2192000	When it's XI, it's 11.
2192000	2193000	Yes.
2193000	2194000	It's me, Si.
2194000	2195000	IX is 9.
2195000	2196000	Yes.
2196000	2197000	X.
2197000	2198000	But, yeah.
2198000	2199000	G.
2199000	2200000	It's Final Fantasy.
2200000	2201000	Or, not Final Fantasy.
2201000	2202000	Dragon Quest G.
2202000	2203000	G.
2203000	2204000	Anyway.
2204000	2205000	They...
2205000	2206000	Uh...
2206000	2207000	Deh.
2207000	2208000	So, on September 4th,
2208000	2211000	Dragon Quest XI Echoes of an Elusive Age,
2211000	2213000	and also Echoes of an Elusive Game,
2213000	2218000	will be coming out on PlayStation 4 and PC on Steam in North America and Europe.
2218000	2224000	We will also receive a Switch version, but it will not be finished for a little while.
2224000	2228000	But, then again, we're also not getting the 3DS version,
2228000	2233000	because, apparently, Squeenix wants to avoid dividing its focus.
2233000	2235000	So, whatever.
2235000	2242000	But, hey, at least we're getting support for Dragon Quest games, you know, officially now.
2242000	2247000	It's gonna be nice to get Dragon Quest XI, seeing as Dragon Quest X never happened.
2247000	2250000	Now, I get Dragon Quest X as online, but it would've been nice.
2250000	2251000	It would've been nice.
2251000	2254000	It apparently will have all the pomp it's meant to have, so...
2254000	2255000	Huzzah.
2255000	2258000	I'll definitely be picking that up.
2258000	2259000	See America, this face?
2259000	2260000	Yeah.
2260000	2261000	It tells you everything you need to know.
2261000	2264000	Even though this is radio, we cannot see this face.
2264000	2266000	Dot com.
2266000	2268000	Alright, Logie.
2268000	2272000	So, they're making a Carmen Sandiego movie for Netflix.
2272000	2273000	Yeah.
2273000	2275000	Who's Carmen Sandiego? That's the most important part.
2275000	2276000	Jennifer Lopez?
2276000	2277000	Gina Rodriguez.
2277000	2278000	That's not bad.
2278000	2279000	Who was in Annihilation.
2279000	2280000	Oh, okay.
2280000	2282000	I didn't realize they actually cast somebody. Okay.
2282000	2283000	Sure.
2283000	2287000	So, that's gonna be a live action movie.
2287000	2292000	And, then, also, apparently, they're gonna be doing another animated project that's coming out.
2292000	2294000	A series that's in 2019.
2294000	2297000	She'll be doing the voice of Carmen Sandiego for that as well.
2297000	2299000	Well, that's cool. They kind of do that to tie it together.
2299000	2301000	I wonder, is it gonna be geared towards kids then?
2301000	2305000	Like, even if they're doing a Carmen Sandiego movie, are they gonna kind of gear it towards kids?
2305000	2311000	I mean, it does say it's gonna be triple X, so, I mean, yes, I assume it's gonna be geared towards kids.
2311000	2313000	Triple X art core?
2313000	2318000	Where in my butt is Carmen Sandiego?
2318000	2321000	No, I think they're gonna do a kids version.
2321000	2322000	I wonder if they'll bring characters to the game show.
2322000	2326000	Like, they'll have the ch- I mean, honestly, obviously, rest in peace, Lin.
2326000	2331000	Thigpen is not able to be the chief, but maybe they will have, you know, the same style that she did.
2331000	2334000	They'll have, like, a chief of police. Maybe they'll bring over some of the stuff.
2334000	2338000	Maybe the theme song will be that doo-wop, doo-ba-doo-ba-boo-wop.
2338000	2339000	I doubt it.
2339000	2340000	It needs to be the ending credits.
2340000	2349000	I think the big climatic final scene in the Carmen Sandiego movie needs to be somebody putting together a map of, like, what was the heart of Africa?
2349000	2353000	Or, like, one of those countries or one of those continents where, like, it was really hard.
2353000	2359000	Like, when the kid got, like, when the kid got, like, the states in America, that was always easy, right?
2359000	2360000	They would just breeze right through that.
2360000	2364000	But when they got, like, Europe or Africa, it was, like, really hard.
2364000	2366000	And they couldn't do it in an amount of time.
2366000	2367000	You thought it was hard?
2367000	2370000	No, I didn't say I thought it was hard.
2370000	2372000	Like, when they had to, like, name places there or something?
2372000	2375000	No, like, you remember the big map on the floor?
2375000	2376000	That's right, that's right, that's right.
2376000	2377000	And they have to fill in the map.
2377000	2381000	But, like, some people, you know, and even- God, if you asked me to do it today, I don't know if I would.
2381000	2384000	I don't know if I would. I wouldn't be able to do it in two minutes or whatever the time limit is.
2384000	2386000	I would have to really think it through.
2386000	2388000	Well, countries today, though, are not what the countries were then.
2388000	2389000	True.
2389000	2391000	And, I mean, it's serious that borders, you know, change.
2391000	2392000	That is true.
2392000	2393000	All the time.
2393000	2394000	That is true. But, you know, still.
2394000	2399000	Okay, if you had to name, like, if you had to point in an empty map of Africa and name every country, would you be able to do it?
2399000	2400000	Because I don't think I could.
2400000	2401000	No.
2401000	2402000	I'd get South Africa.
2402000	2406000	I'd get a good chunk. I'd get a pretty good chunk.
2406000	2409000	Like, I can pretty much name most of the coasts.
2409000	2410000	Yeah.
2410000	2413000	That's me, too. I could probably do all the coastal countries. Yeah.
2413000	2414000	Yeah.
2414000	2420000	And, like, Northern Africa, I could probably do better because it would be Egypt, Lebanon, all that. Yeah.
2420000	2421000	But, no.
2421000	2425000	Even Europe. Even Europe, I doubt I could do. Or South America. Actually-
2425000	2427000	Rob, where is Luxembourg?
2427000	2429000	Germany?
2429000	2431000	Luxembourg is a country.
2431000	2433000	I could do-
2433000	2435000	So it's not in Germany?
2435000	2437000	I could do South-
2437000	2439000	Y'all need education, okay?
2439000	2441000	I could do South America.
2441000	2448000	All right. Well, that, what Carmen Sandiego was how I was getting my education and it's gone, Dar Sakura. It's gone.
2448000	2449000	Well, I didn't do it.
2449000	2450000	All right.
2450000	2451000	Girl.
2451000	2452000	You did, though.
2452000	2454000	I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
2454000	2455000	All right, when-
2455000	2457000	I am innocent.
2457000	2460000	When is the release of Carmen Sandiego on Netflix?
2460000	2466000	They haven't said yet. Other than the animated series, which is in 2019, they haven't said when the movie's coming out yet, so-
2466000	2467000	You may get us wait.
2467000	2469000	I think we need to see a trailer first before-
2469000	2470000	Yes.
2470000	2481000	Unless they pull, like, you know, hey, here's Carmen Sandiego. But they can't do that because we don't know where Carmen Sandiego is, so, you know, they can't show us that.
2481000	2491000	You know, I always had this theory when I was playing the games as a kid that Carmen Sandiego was a code name for a big organization, that it wasn't a single person.
2491000	2495000	I was getting into this conspiracy theory shit when I was eight.
2495000	2496000	Eight.
2496000	2497000	You? You?
2497000	2498000	Me.
2498000	2501000	All right. Anyway, what do you have for us? Another story.
2501000	2503000	What, me? Me?
2503000	2504000	Yeah, you.
2504000	2505000	Ikaruga.
2505000	2506000	Mm-hmm.
2506000	2511000	Which isn't Radiant Silver Gun. I want Radiant Silver Gun.
2511000	2522000	Anyway, the German USK has a rated Ikaruga for PlayStation 4 being, of course, developed again by Treshar. Treasure.
2522000	2528000	And so, I'm trying to get what they said, though, the date on it, because the stupid thing isn't listing the date.
2528000	2529000	Wait, these are the-
2529000	2530000	This says it's rated, so no date on it.
2530000	2532000	The German USK?
2532000	2533000	Yeah.
2533000	2534000	Is that in Luxembourg?
2536000	2537000	Fuck off.
2537000	2539000	I'll show you Luxembourg when I kick you over there.
2539000	2540000	Fuck off.
2540000	2549000	But yeah, Ikaruga is once again being released on yet another system, as if you didn't already play Ikaruga on, what was it?
2549000	2550000	All of the other systems.
2550000	2556000	Dreamcast, yeah, it came out in the arcade, then we had Dreamcast, GameCube, Xbox 360, and PC.
2556000	2559000	When is someone gonna demake Ikaruga for the 2600?
2559000	2561000	That's what we need to plan on.
2561000	2564000	Would it kill Treasure to do a new shooter? I mean, to be fair-
2564000	2568000	Would it kill Treasure to do a new silhouette mirage?
2568000	2576000	And to be fair, to be fair, new shooter games are coming out all the time in Japan, and so few of them make it over here, and I don't follow the genre close enough.
2576000	2582000	I'm sure I will get tweets like, Rob, there's been all these shooter games you don't even know about, and yeah, because they don't ever seem to come over here.
2582000	2584000	Like, it's just not- the genre does not-
2584000	2588000	For a little while we were getting, like, some of them, like, when we got Death Smiles and-
2588000	2589000	I would think the-
2589000	2590000	Mushi Himesama and-
2590000	2592000	The Switch would be such a good system for those.
2592000	2593000	It would.
2593000	2599000	Because you can flip it vertically, like, in the, um, Pinball FX3, it has a vertical mode, and you can hold-
2599000	2600000	Yeah.
2600000	2606000	Yeah, and, like, that would be fucking great for shmups, but for whatever reason we just don't have a lot yet, but maybe soon.
2607000	2609000	And the Switch is region free, so-
2609000	2610000	How very dear they are.
2610000	2611000	Where is that?
2611000	2615000	But, cool, Ikaruga on PlayStation 4, why not? Why not? Let's do it again.
2615000	2616000	Ikaruga.
2616000	2618000	Why not? We did Rez again, let's do Ikaruga again.
2618000	2623000	How about, just, somebody give me Radiant Silver Gun on Saturn, and I'll shut up about Ikaruga.
2623000	2626000	Alright. Uh, Logi.
2626000	2638000	Alright, so, there's this article that was about, um, I guess this Windows Core OS, which is, I guess, the next step for Windows 10, or kind of a tweak to it.
2638000	2649000	So, what they're going to be doing with this, basically, I guess they're saying, Microsoft Windows Vision, which includes the idea of a gaming mode for playing games with an Xbox controller.
2649000	2653000	And, um, you know, they're talking about some of the features.
2653000	2662000	Windows Seashell, it says, with the same kernel, a flexible core, and a unified app platform, the last piece of the shell, or UI, that itself can adapt to the screen.
2662000	2671000	Taking the idea of continuum to the OS level, Seashell lets devices adjust their UIs for different tasks and experiences.
2671000	2679000	A device running full Windows 10 for desktop would be able to take on a Windows 10 mobile UI to run in phone mode.
2679000	2686000	Or, for example, a Windows 10 PC could take on the Xbox UI when in gaming mode.
2686000	2696000	This means that we'll see an Xbox UI come to Windows 10, and this means we'll be able to launch Xbox games through this UI.
2696000	2707000	This also means that we'll see third-party Xbox PC consoles, um, if the OEM wants to use the native Windows 32 support or not.
2707000	2725000	An OEM can create an Xbox PC console with S mode enabled, which has native Windows 32 compatibility, and can switch between normal Windows 10, or can be based on Polaris, which has no native Windows 32, and based on the universal Windows platform.
2725000	2726000	They're not going to make such happen.
2726000	2733000	This also means, um, the future, we could see Xbox hardware that comes with a controller and a mouse and keyboard.
2733000	2734000	Hmm.
2734000	2739000	So that they're going to turn the Xboxes into PCs, and the PCs into Xboxes.
2739000	2740000	Interesting.
2740000	2757000	Um, and being that, you know, with that, there's also the possibility that, um, with this universal Windows platform and this special shell that maybe, since they're going to be running Windows 10, that you can get Steam games for your Windows, or your Xbox console.
2757000	2761000	So essentially they're just trying to make, like, the Xbox console basically a PC on your television at this point.
2761000	2762000	Almost.
2762000	2763000	Steam box, basically.
2763000	2764000	Yeah.
2764000	2765000	Interesting.
2765000	2766000	I haven't heard a lot about Steam boxes.
2766000	2767000	Interesting.
2767000	2779000	But my thing with this, and like, don't get me wrong, it sounds exciting, but I remember talking with a Microsoft rep back in 2012 about this type of thing, and they were like, oh yeah, it's right around the corner.
2779000	2780000	So...
2780000	2786000	Well, the games for Windows thing was like a very, like, Xbox 360 kind of shell around games.
2786000	2787000	You know?
2787000	2788000	And there was stuff, of course...
2788000	2789000	It was a terrible shell.
2790000	2800000	I got to pour one out for Game Room, because I'm always going to bring up Game Room, but that was one of those things that, you know, it had that you could play it on both sides, and it would remember who you are, and it had that same type of shell on it, you know?
2800000	2802000	Was it just ahead of its time, Loki?
2802000	2804000	Yes, I guess so.
2804000	2806000	But, I mean, that's a neat idea.
2807000	2814000	I'd be really interested to hear more about it and see when it's going to be implemented, because right now it's just kind of talk.
2814000	2818000	I mean, I'm hopeful that they'll do something.
2818000	2825000	I maybe need to see more Xbox integration, even more reason not to buy an Xbox One.
2825000	2826000	It's kind of confusing.
2826000	2835000	But I guess if they're still able to sell Xbox One games on PC, then does it really matter that they're not selling consoles that they don't make anything off of?
2836000	2839000	Well, I think they're still selling enough Xboxes.
2839000	2847000	The question is, when they do implement this, and we're buying lots of Xbox One games, am I going to have to pay for Xbox One or Xbox Live Gold?
2847000	2851000	Because they're, oh, well, now you have to.
2851000	2852000	Whereas, no, we don't.
2852000	2853000	Who knows?
2853000	2864000	But that's going to be hard to sell on a platform that can, you know, yeah, I could buy this game here, or I could buy the Steam version, which doesn't have to do that.
2864000	2865000	We'll see.
2865000	2868000	Maybe E3 will have some answers, but probably not.
2868000	2872000	It just really sounded like their whole press release there was full of wind.
2872000	2877000	Like, oh, we're going to talk about kernels, as if we're Linux.
2877000	2878000	No.
2878000	2880000	We got one more from you, right, Jamie?
2880000	2882000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2882000	2887000	I'm sorry, I'm just completely unimpressed with Microsoft bullshit.
2887000	2893000	So, 2018 World Video Game Hall of Fame finalists.
2893000	2897000	If there are the finalists listed, you can still vote for them.
2897000	2898000	Wait, where is this?
2898000	2900000	Oh, this is the Video Game Hall of Fame.
2900000	2903000	Yeah, the Strongs World Video Game Hall of Fame.
2903000	2904000	Yeah, this does come up every year.
2904000	2905000	Okay.
2905000	2907000	Yeah, and you can vote for it.
2907000	2909000	You have to look for the website.
2909000	2917000	But the voting closes on, well, the inductees will be announced on Thursday, May 3rd, at 1030.
2917000	2919000	So, you can vote for the following.
2919000	2928000	Asteroids, Call of Duty from 2003, Dance Dance Revolution, Final Fantasy VII, Half-Life, John Madden Football,
2928000	2934000	King's Quest, Metroid, Minecraft, Ms. Pac-Man, Space War, and Tomb Raider.
2934000	2936000	And if you don't vote for DDR, I'm disowning you.
2936000	2938000	I thought they already had Minecraft in there.
2938000	2940000	Maybe it was just nominated before.
2940000	2943000	It was a finalist from before.
2944000	2948000	Here's the thing. I went, and you can actually pull a Wiki article on all this.
2948000	2950000	It's located in Rochester, New York.
2950000	2953000	And if you want to vote, worldvideogamehalloffame.org.
2953000	2954000	Here's the class of 20...
2954000	2959000	Wait a second. I thought that there was another hall of fame somewhere else in the Midwest.
2959000	2965000	Are you thinking of the one, the classics in Otumwa or whatever that town is, or all the 80s?
2965000	2969000	Something like that, where they were saying like, oh, we're the center of video games.
2969000	2971000	That's Twin Galaxy's thing.
2971000	2974000	No, that wasn't Twin Galaxy's. It was some like...
2974000	2979000	Are you to say that there is more than one place claiming that they're the hall of fame of video games?
2979000	2983000	Back in the day, the Metreon had that walk of fame, right?
2983000	2986000	Well, we're the video game hall of fame now, bitches.
2986000	2989000	All right. Anyway, Loki, the one in Rochester, New York.
2989000	2996000	Okay, so in 2015, they inducted Doom, Pac-Man, Pong, Super Mario Brothers, Tetris, World of Warcraft.
2996000	2999000	Minecraft was a nominee. It was not inducted.
2999000	3000000	So that's the difference.
3000000	3006000	It's like how, what's the band that over and over again never gets into the Music Hall of Fame?
3006000	3008000	Boston? No, Boston made it.
3008000	3012000	There was some band that was getting nominated every fucking year and wasn't getting in.
3012000	3015000	Was it Black Sabbath?
3015000	3018000	I bet it was Black Sabbath. I could be wrong, though. Don't quote me on that.
3018000	3029000	2016 had the inductees were the original Legend of Zelda, the Oregon Trail, The Sims, Sonic the Hedgehog, Space Invaders, and Grand Theft Auto 3.
3029000	3036000	And then in 2017, they inducted Pokemon Red and Green, or Blue, depending on what country you're in.
3036000	3039000	Street Fighter 2, Donkey Kong, and Halo.
3039000	3040000	So that's where it is right now.
3040000	3047000	So now, yes, they have some holdover finalists, but there are some new finalists, which include Dance Dance Revolution.
3047000	3050000	Although, I gotta be honest, how many do you get to vote for on this list?
3050000	3051000	Three? Four?
3052000	3058000	If I had to vote for four, I would vote for King's Quest, Metroid.
3060000	3064000	I'm looking at the list. King's Quest, Metroid. Yeah, I'd vote for DDR for me.
3064000	3069000	DDR and... I might do Minecraft. I don't know.
3070000	3072000	But that's my opinion. I'm sure everybody else has theirs.
3072000	3075000	I'd vote for DDR, DDR, DDR, and Metroid.
3076000	3077000	Alright.
3077000	3082000	I don't know, I'd probably give Final Fantasy VII a mention, just because I played a shit ton of that game.
3082000	3084000	Yeah, because you had to watch Aerith Die over and over.
3084000	3089000	Well, yeah, that too. But it really was kind of a genre changer. You know, really it was.
3089000	3099000	People, you know, I don't care if you hate or love the game, it has to be admitted that it changed things for RPGs.
3099000	3100000	It was a moment.
3100000	3104000	It was a moment. We were all a little verklempt.
3104000	3108000	Especially when I watch Aerith Die. I'm happy verklempt.
3108000	3111000	Let's do one more from Loki and then we'll do the classic game of the week.
3111000	3116000	Alright. Let's see. How about we talk about Lindsay Lohan?
3116000	3117000	How about no?
3117000	3118000	Is she still in rehab?
3118000	3120000	I don't know, but Lindsay Lohan...
3120000	3124000	No, she's like the official spokesperson for like Lawyer.com or something now.
3124000	3130000	Well, it's a good thing that she is a spokesperson for Lawyer.com, because I'm sure she's utilized them quite a bit.
3130000	3133000	To sue Grand Theft Auto for...
3133000	3134000	Again?
3134000	3139000	No, I think it's the same lawsuit. It's been that long. Yes, that's right.
3139000	3149000	So this lawsuit was basically, for those who don't remember, it was in regards to some of the artwork and characters that were in Grand Theft Auto 5.
3149000	3154000	Mainly, I don't remember the name, Lacey Jonas, who was in the game.
3154000	3159000	And she was kind of like this, you know, stall...
3159000	3169000	There's like a Hollywood, you know, young, you know, kind of TMZ trashy celebrity person.
3169000	3175000	You know, where she was, you know, had a sex tape and like getting in accidents for being drunk and stuff like that.
3175000	3188000	And apparently they're saying, oh, you know, because the artwork has, you know, this blonde chick in a bikini that, you know, Lindsay Lohan has also worn a bikini.
3188000	3192000	But let me guess, parody is acceptable and it's parody.
3192000	3201000	Yeah, basically they said that, you know, that her complaint that was, you know, lookalike and it looked exactly like her.
3201000	3211000	But unfortunately they said that, you know, didn't find that the computer generated images, avatars or NPCs can legally be called portraits.
3211000	3216000	And so they said that Jonas wasn't a portrait of Lohan.
3216000	3222000	So apparently, you know, that's been dismissed.
3222000	3230000	And yes, she is officially the new spokesperson for Lawyer.com, which makes this whole thing ironic.
3231000	3232000	It's like Ray.
3232000	3234000	So, I mean, just get over it, dude.
3234000	3239000	I mean, like what? That game came out like how many years ago was that?
3239000	3240000	A little bit now.
3240000	3243000	We're getting ready for Grand Theft Auto 6, although we got to get through it.
3243000	3245000	It's like we got to get through Red Dead 2 first.
3245000	3246000	2010, maybe.
3246000	3248000	I think it was a while ago.
3248000	3249000	All right.
3249000	3251000	Well, let's let's travel.
3251000	3253000	Let's travel back to simpler times, shall we?
3253000	3261000	Let's step into the gaming vault and go back to a simpler time when Lindsay Lohan was getting Golden Globe nominations for the parent trap.
3261000	3262000	When she was in Mean Girls.
3262000	3264000	But she was a hot redhead.
3264000	3265000	Yeah.
3265000	3267000	Well, she was like seven in the parent trap.
3267000	3269000	No, I'm not talking about then.
3269000	3273000	I'm talking about later when she was, you know, a hot redhead, not a tiny child.
3273000	3274000	Thank you for clarifying.
3274000	3275000	All right.
3275000	3277000	It's the classic game of the week.
3277000	3284000	And once a week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks, hey, Bratz, play this game.
3284000	3286000	Put down your Bratz and play this game.
3286000	3287000	I'll whip you.
3287000	3289000	Whip it good.
3289000	3292000	And that's a pun because it ties into this classic game of the week.
3292000	3293000	Which pick Dark Soccer?
3293000	3306000	I picked Akuma Joe Dracula, as in the version specifically that came out on the Sharp X68000, which was re-released as Castlevania Chronicles.
3306000	3318000	But this one in particular was notable because the game, well, first of all, the original release date in Japan, which it only came out in Japan, was July 23rd, 1993.
3319000	3328000	And the X68000, as I've covered last year in our classic console, the games ran on floppies.
3328000	3334000	They were, you know, pretty much Capcom put a lot of games on them because they were pretty much arcade perfect.
3334000	3338000	But it was a really, really good system, good computer system.
3338000	3347000	So it was based off of the original Castlevania, which in return was also almost simultaneously released as the MSX2's Vampire Killer.
3347000	3350000	So they were all kind of the same game.
3350000	3356000	But it had a new engine that was designed to take full advantage of the Sharp X68000 software.
3356000	3360000	It was completely updated and all the stages were re-designed.
3360000	3362000	Brand new stages included.
3362000	3364000	All the special items, sub-weapons.
3364000	3370000	A rare item called the Laurel, which fills six health blocks for ten hearts.
3370000	3374000	And it also was really fucking hard.
3374000	3380000	I've played an emulated version of it. It was pretty hard.
3380000	3384000	You also have the hidden items, the different one-ups, all kinds of stuff in it.
3384000	3386000	It's a Castlevania game.
3386000	3392000	But it also did get harder the more you played it too.
3392000	3403000	It even had, you know, different things going on with it when the later editions came out with the Castlevania Chronicles included more goodies in it.
3403000	3405000	But I'm still focusing on the original.
3405000	3410000	So the musical of the X68000 also had new arrangements for a lot of the music.
3410000	3418000	Because one of the advantages that the X68000 had is that you could choose different sound modules.
3418000	3425000	So you could use the FM synthesizer, a MIDI roll in LA, and you could also use a MIDI roll in GS.
3425000	3432000	So it also had a hidden general MIDI module that was of course not in the re-release of Castlevania Chronicles.
3432000	3439000	And so the instrumentation would vary depending on which of the sound modules that you would use with it.
3439000	3446000	And I mean, it was just a really great game. Very fucking difficult.
3446000	3454000	But of course, it did get re-released all over the world later on as Castlevania Chronicles.
3454000	3456000	And it did include some other stuff.
3456000	3472000	Although in the Japanese version, unlike the English versions, the hardware selection screen would appear automatically when you played in original mode the same way it did on Akuma Joe Dracula for X68000.
3472000	3475000	You have to use a special code to get it on the American ones.
3475000	3486000	But it was, I mean, I was very happy that the game did get a re-release eventually because the X68000, I mean, it was number one only out in Japan.
3486000	3489000	Even getting one of those systems is super expensive.
3489000	3496000	And, you know, on top of it, it's just a really awesome game.
3496000	3498000	You know, one that a lot of people missed out on.
3498000	3503000	So is Castlevania Chronicles that different, or is it like, if I play Castlevania Chronicles, I'm pretty much playing?
3503000	3506000	Castlevania Chronicles does have the original version in it.
3506000	3509000	It also does have an arranged and updated version.
3509000	3510000	Oh, okay.
3510000	3519000	And I'm actually really sad because it needed more information for the original release of it, and sadly my normal resource doesn't have everything I needed.
3519000	3526000	But, because the Castlevania Chronicles is actually a full port, but it also did add some other features and an arranged mode.
3527000	3537000	But it's, just playing the original version of it, you'd get a really strong appreciation for just what a good, solid Castlevania game is.
3537000	3541000	And I feel like there's a lot in here too that is influenced back and forth.
3541000	3546000	Like the stage two that they're playing now, this looks very similar to a stage in Super Castlevania.
3546000	3554000	Like there's, I mean, obviously like every Castlevania game that was a side-scroller kind of has that same first stage with the white walls where you fight the bat at the end.
3555000	3557000	The first going into the castle.
3557000	3560000	Yeah, you get a lot of deviation in the games after that.
3560000	3568000	And like I noticed the stage two, the underground stage, there's a stage very similar to this in, complete with the falling rocks and everything that was in Super Castlevania IV.
3568000	3574000	So it's kind of interesting, you see, when Super Castlevania IV would have been around that same era, right?
3574000	3576000	Super Nintendo was what, 91, 92?
3576000	3577000	Yeah, this is 93.
3577000	3582000	Yeah, so clearly there's stuff that influenced each other in it. So just kind of neat.
3582000	3587000	I'm checking the Castlevania realm, which is another site they get a lot of Castlevania information from.
3587000	3593000	But this just has the character list on it. We play as Simon Belmont.
3593000	3606000	And I'm trying to get the producer and composer information on this one because the remake was produced by Igarashi.
3606000	3609000	But yeah, I'm not finding what I need on this one.
3609000	3623000	Sadly, and this is also what I get for thinking of it on the way here, but I mean the game when it came out, you want to know how big the game was?
3623000	3625000	2.4 megabytes.
3625000	3626000	Jeez.
3626000	3627000	Right?
3627000	3633000	That's nothing by today's standards, but then again also like Atari 2600 games were 4 kilobytes.
3634000	3643000	Here we go. Here's an interview with the developer. And that was Ueda Hideo of Konami was the developer of it.
3643000	3653000	And I love the box art for it. The original artwork has like the kind of western style artwork. You know how you got the behind the head view of Simon?
3653000	3656000	This is like the front view with the whip going out.
3657000	3664000	So the artwork is really awesome. This is actually a pretty good article. I read it a while back.
3664000	3672000	But it was talking about how they wanted to take advantage of the new stuff the X68000 could do to put out the game that they originally wanted to make.
3672000	3680000	And so it's just really awesome. And it also does offer differences for the other versions of the Sharp X systems.
3680000	3687000	Like the X68030 has a few other, has smoother animation in it for example.
3687000	3697000	So they actually put it out to where it would run fluidly on the multiple Sharp systems. So it's pretty neat.
3698000	3706000	Cool. There it is. Your classic game of the week. Akumajo Dracula for the X68000. But most of you probably just know it as Castlevania Chronicles.
3706000	3709000	Yeah and if you're playing Castlevania Chronicles you just should play Dracula X anyway.
3709000	3716000	Alright. There it is. Your classic game of the week. Thank you Darcy. I can never resist a good Castlevania game.
3716000	3720000	We've had a lot of them as classic games of the week but that's because they're all pretty good.
3720000	3722000	Yeah and the other one I picked that we had already done.
3723000	3729000	I know you're getting to that point. I'll just say when you sent me the text you said Salamander for the other one.
3729000	3736000	I was like did you know? That was episode 350. That means that was over 400 episodes ago that you picked that game.
3736000	3740000	But how are you going to remember that far back? Thank god we have the wiki.
3740000	3745000	And I was picking a game without the wiki to rely on.
3746000	3753000	I was quite literally in my car about to leave work and I was like oh here's a game. I don't think I've done this one.
3753000	3755000	I know I've done some of the others but I don't think I've done this one.
3757000	3759000	But thankfully they keep putting new ones out.
3759000	3761000	I'm just going to start doing classic pinball.
3761000	3764000	With our little 10 year rule more and more games become eligible.
3764000	3767000	Yeah I already got one for my next pick that I'm going to do.
3767000	3768000	Oh good. I have to think about that.
3768000	3769000	Whenever that is.
3769000	3774000	Usually it's easy for me because I just picked something from the Commodore 64 because she doesn't have that same attachment that I do.
3775000	3778000	You know what I played the most of on the Commodore 64? Centipede.
3778000	3780000	Okay good. Me too.
3780000	3784000	I want that fucking C64 Mini. In fact I need to see if they're up.
3784000	3788000	I know backers of their little whatever they did to Kickstarter or something.
3788000	3791000	We're getting those because somebody either posted on our Discord.
3791000	3793000	Shout out to the VoG Network Discord.
3793000	3794000	VoGnetwork.com slash Discord.
3794000	3797000	Somebody either posted there or on my Facebook. I don't remember where.
3797000	3800000	But Ashley is showing that the Mini is going out and it's getting reviews.
3800000	3803000	I fucking want one. They're awesome.
3803000	3805000	I tried to find you a real one.
3805000	3806000	Aww.
3806000	3807000	I tried.
3807000	3812000	My dad has one. He's tried to give it to me but it's been out in the garage for I don't know how long. It's not going to work.
3812000	3817000	Actually, Dan fixed my ColecoVision.
3817000	3818000	Really?
3818000	3823000	And he just took it apart, cleaned it up, did some new soldering to it.
3823000	3824000	Works great.
3824000	3825000	Maybe it will work. We'll see.
3825000	3829000	As long as the CRT works the components can be fixed.
3829000	3831000	And you can add your own games to it.
3831000	3834000	Yeah, that's true. Well, with the Minis I think you can do that too.
3834000	3835000	Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
3835000	3838000	So yeah, the Minis, the nice thing about the Minis is they have HDMI's.
3838000	3841000	So it's easier in that regard.
3841000	3843000	I'm still wanting a Vectrex.
3843000	3844000	I'd love to add a Vectrex to that.
3844000	3846000	Had one, wasn't worth it.
3846000	3851000	Alright, let's before we go over to the rest of the news from this week from Loki,
3851000	3854000	why don't we travel around the world and check out some release dates.
3854000	3856000	I don't know if you're ready for that, Loki.
3856000	3859000	Yeah, I've only got one so it should be easy.
3860000	3865000	So this week we've got a game called Penny Punching Princess on the Nintendo Switch and Vita.
3865000	3866000	That sounds amazing.
3866000	3868000	Sounds pretty amazing. What are you doing Penny Punching Princess?
3868000	3869000	I have no idea.
3869000	3870000	You punch pennies?
3870000	3872000	Or do you punch the princess?
3872000	3873000	That's not okay though.
3873000	3874000	She's a cheapskate.
3874000	3876000	Unless she's into that.
3876000	3881000	So that sadly, that's all we've got.
3881000	3882000	Wow.
3882000	3884000	I've only got two in the UK.
3884000	3886000	April is usually a pretty light month.
3886000	3888000	Japan's looking a little slow too.
3888000	3890000	I was going to say traveling over to Japan.
3890000	3893000	Watch Dogs 2 gets a price reduction on the Playstation 4.
3893000	3894000	So there's that.
3894000	3897000	And then you go over to the Nintendo Switch.
3897000	3900000	The Phantasy Star Online 2 Cloud.
3900000	3902000	That is out on April 4th.
3902000	3903000	So that's pretty exciting.
3903000	3905000	Why do we not have this?
3905000	3907000	Don't fucking get me started.
3907000	3909000	I'm so pressed about this.
3909000	3910000	You could make a panini.
3910000	3912000	I am so pressed.
3912000	3913000	That's really it though.
3913000	3914000	Yeah, it's a very big game.
3914000	3916000	But I had to look up this penny punching princess thing.
3916000	3920000	And it looks like these little princesses have these big iron fists.
3920000	3924000	And they punch monsters and coins fall out.
3924000	3926000	Oh, coins.
3926000	3927000	Yeah.
3927000	3929000	And then there's a calculator involved somehow I would assume.
3929000	3932000	With all the pennies that you're collecting.
3932000	3933000	So there you go.
3933000	3935000	Anyway, what about you Dark Soccer with Europe?
3935000	3938000	Two things.
3938000	3943000	Time Carnage on April 6th and The American Dream on April 6th.
3943000	3948000	Which looks like a bunch of violent Americans in the 50s with guns.
3948000	3950000	So that's it.
3950000	3951000	Alright.
3951000	3953000	Let's do a few more.
3953000	3955000	By the way, we're going to roll our mailbag over to next week.
3955000	3957000	So we'll be answering your emails live.
3957000	3962000	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us an email for next week.
3962000	3965000	But we do have a few more news stories from Loki.
3965000	3967000	Yeah, we can talk about some quick stuff.
3967000	3971000	So the PlayStation VR bundle got a price drop this week.
3971000	3972000	I saw that.
3972000	3973000	$100 cheaper now.
3973000	3976000	I might finally have to jump in on that.
3976000	3979000	So you can get like the camera and everything.
3979000	3981000	I already have the camera.
3981000	3983000	I think though it's separate though.
3983000	3987000	I think you can get it without the camera and stuff and it's like $239.
3987000	3989000	So I don't know.
3989000	3990000	I'd have to check.
3990000	3992000	But I still need the move.
3992000	3994000	Well I guess you don't need it.
3994000	3996000	You probably want it.
3996000	3998000	They sell them in like two packs though.
3998000	4001000	I think you can probably buy them at GameStop and stuff.
4001000	4006000	In fact I was just checking right now to see how much they have like the PlayStation VR listed here.
4006000	4010000	If they got the standalone stuff or not.
4010000	4012000	I'm tempted. We'll see. We'll see.
4012000	4014000	But I might be buying some computer parts.
4014000	4017000	Like you know I've been looking at the show computer.
4017000	4022000	It's not so much because I've actually been talking to somebody about some upgrades for this.
4022000	4024000	But I'm looking at a complete sound overhaul.
4024000	4028000	Standalone suggests the headset itself $199.
4028000	4030000	Oh, that's tempting.
4030000	4032000	And then if you want like.
4032000	4034000	I think that might be.
4034000	4036000	Is that like. I can't.
4036000	4037000	Is that new.
4037000	4039000	That is new.
4039000	4041000	Yeah. Brand new. So $199.
4041000	4042000	OK.
4042000	4044000	Then you probably pick up a move for like $50.
4044000	4047000	And then the move. I think the move controllers.
4047000	4051000	I think they're like $50 or $60 bucks for two of them.
4051000	4053000	It's really inexpensive.
4053000	4054000	OK. Here we go.
4054000	4056000	Just sorry I'm bringing something.
4056000	4061000	While I'm doing that while that page is loading though I did want to say also PlayStation Plus.
4061000	4064000	They've announced what the games are going to be for April.
4064000	4066000	And it looks pretty awesome.
4066000	4071000	So the one big game that they got Mad Max is going to be free.
4071000	4073000	OK. Which is a pretty awesome game.
4073000	4078000	Also Trackmania Turbo if you don't have that yet which unfortunately I do.
4079000	4086000	And then also looks like I think this is one of the last months that we're going to get PlayStation 3 and Vita games.
4086000	4091000	But in Space we brawl for PS3 Toy Home on PS3.
4091000	4093000	Ninety nine VITAs.
4093000	4095000	I think it's VITAs.
4095000	4097000	On the Vita.
4097000	4099000	And Qbert reloaded on the Vita.
4099000	4101000	It's also it's also cross by with PlayStation.
4101000	4103000	That game is fucking terrible.
4103000	4104000	Just so you know.
4104000	4106000	But it's free.
4106000	4107000	It isn't even worth free.
4108000	4109000	Mad Max is worth free.
4109000	4112000	So definitely check out Mad Max if you guys get chance.
4112000	4114000	And then let's see.
4114000	4115000	So did this page load.
4115000	4116000	No it didn't.
4116000	4119000	Because GameStop's page fucking sucks.
4121000	4122000	Whatever.
4122000	4124000	All right. It's fine. It's not a big deal.
4124000	4125000	All right.
4125000	4126000	Any more stories.
4126000	4127000	Yeah.
4127000	4129000	I've got like tons of shit pulled up.
4129000	4130000	So let's.
4130000	4132000	This is something they'll be interested in.
4132000	4133000	Luminous Remastered.
4134000	4135000	For Switch.
4135000	4136000	Oh yes. Yes I did.
4136000	4137000	Thank you for bringing this up.
4137000	4140000	I did hear about this because it was part of the Nindies thing that they did.
4140000	4141000	Yeah.
4141000	4142000	While we were gone.
4142000	4143000	That was two weeks ago I think.
4143000	4144000	But it's fine.
4144000	4145000	Whatever.
4145000	4146000	But we should talk about it.
4146000	4147000	Yes.
4147000	4148000	So Luminous Remastered.
4148000	4149000	I'm so about.
4149000	4150000	Well it's not just on Switch.
4150000	4151000	I mean I'll probably get it there.
4151000	4152000	Yeah.
4152000	4153000	It's Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
4153000	4154000	Yeah.
4154000	4155000	But how would I not get it on Switch.
4155000	4156000	Exactly.
4156000	4159000	With the ability to do portable just like the old school one and you know dock it as
4159000	4160000	well.
4160000	4161000	Like it's.
4161000	4162000	It's.
4162000	4163000	It's hard now.
4163000	4165000	The Switch makes a really compelling argument when it's like the same price.
4165000	4167000	And it's portable on that system.
4167000	4169000	You know versus PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4169000	4172000	As much as I love some of my games on those systems.
4172000	4173000	So.
4173000	4174000	Yeah.
4174000	4175000	And here's some of the things that they have in there.
4175000	4177000	So they've got you know new skins.
4177000	4179000	They had two new levels.
4179000	4181000	40 skins as well.
4181000	4182000	Different modes.
4182000	4184000	HD rumble effects.
4184000	4186000	So you can you know feel different stuff like that.
4186000	4189000	And of course trans vibration.
4189000	4190000	Yay.
4190000	4194000	And you could do it with like up to like 10 Switch controllers or something crazy like
4194000	4195000	that.
4195000	4196000	I didn't.
4196000	4197000	Yeah.
4197000	4198000	I don't see how many.
4198000	4199000	But yeah it's.
4199000	4200000	Yeah.
4200000	4201000	Like multiple Switch.
4201000	4202000	You could.
4202000	4203000	And I was like where would you put all those controllers.
4203000	4204000	Don't answer that.
4204000	4208000	What are you talking about.
4208000	4209000	Remember dark soccer.
4209000	4212000	Ain't as thing as possible.
4212000	4217000	I can't even.
4217000	4218000	How old are we.
4218000	4219000	12.
4219000	4220000	All right.
4220000	4222000	Almost 16.
4222000	4225000	Speaking of games coming to different systems.
4225000	4229000	The game that I don't know if anybody is really asking for this to come to the system but
4229000	4231000	it is anyways.
4231000	4234000	No Man's Sky coming the Xbox One.
4234000	4238000	At least you get it when it's better than it was when it launched.
4238000	4239000	You know.
4239000	4240000	I.
4240000	4241000	You know they.
4241000	4243000	Bless their hearts for still working on that game.
4243000	4245000	And they've still working on the game.
4245000	4249000	This is going to have you know all the features and all the release you know updates that
4249000	4250000	they've done so far.
4250000	4256000	And they're working on something called next No Man's Sky next which is their next step
4256000	4261000	and they're teasing it hard and they're not really seeing what it is teasing would be
4261000	4262000	excited.
4262000	4263000	Yes.
4263000	4264000	They're teasing it.
4264000	4267000	They're going to claim the moon you know but I don't know.
4267000	4268000	It's all right.
4268000	4272000	It's not it's not a terrible game to pick up but at least it's better than what I would
4272000	4277000	only buy it on Xbox One depending on the price and depending on I mean if you already have
4277000	4282000	it on PC or PlayStation 4 I don't understand why you would want to get it on Xbox One.
4282000	4286000	But I know some people out there are you know exclusively Microsoft in their house you know
4286000	4288000	and that's that's fine.
4288000	4290000	So this is a chance for them to get on board.
4290000	4296000	But you know again if the game's like twenty nine ninety nine you know like they've done a
4296000	4297000	lot of updates to it.
4297000	4301000	It's not the same game that people wrote off when it first came out.
4301000	4305000	So it's worth a look I think.
4305000	4309000	Yeah I mean I don't know what you're into if you're into the Minecraft.
4309000	4312000	I think it's that game is more like Minecraft than anything else.
4312000	4316000	I mean you don't build so much with the exploration and a lot of that same sensation.
4316000	4318000	I don't know at least that's what I get out of it.
4318000	4322000	But you know what if you want something like Minecraft you could play Minecraft.
4322000	4324000	You could.
4324000	4328000	I don't know I I think people are really harsh on no man's sky and I understand why but I
4328000	4331000	think a lot's changed in the past couple of years.
4331000	4336000	And if you haven't checked it out in a while it's worth looking at again.
4336000	4343000	And then to go along with that you know VR discount they just did the VR update for wipeout.
4343000	4344000	That's pretty close.
4344000	4346000	Oh yeah it's pretty close.
4346000	4348000	You know if zero that's the closest thing I'll get to have zero.
4348000	4353000	That seems like who that seems like that would almost be like like headache inducing that moving
4353000	4355000	that fast.
4355000	4357000	It would definitely be something.
4357000	4360000	Yeah I want to check that out kinda.
4360000	4362000	You're making a case I almost like God.
4362000	4365000	I just I need more shit in my living room.
4365000	4367000	It's fun for a while.
4367000	4368000	I know I know I know.
4368000	4371000	Wipeout is only best with an edgy con.
4371000	4373000	Well you can't get that on the PlayStation 4 I'm sorry to say.
4373000	4376000	Yeah so the PlayStation 4 is highly inferior.
4376000	4383000	And then I guess I guess I can talk about one more thing and that's Duke Nukem the movie happening.
4383000	4385000	John Cena is Duke Nukem.
4385000	4387000	OK I would watch it.
4387000	4389000	To see John Cena is Duke Nukem.
4389000	4390000	Whatever.
4390000	4391000	Whatever.
4391000	4394000	It's my bar for Duke Nukem the movie.
4394000	4395000	So low.
4395000	4399000	I mean it just can't get any lower after you know Duke Nukem forever.
4399000	4404000	So there is no way I can be disappointed by John Cena in a Duke Nukem movie.
4404000	4405000	It's impossible.
4405000	4407000	I mean who else would you cast right.
4407000	4408000	I guess it makes sense.
4408000	4410000	He does look the part.
4410000	4412000	He does have the square head.
4412000	4414000	And he has to do the hand in his face so that we know it's John Cena.
4414000	4418000	He's doing that whole pro wrestling to acting thing just like The Rock did.
4418000	4419000	It's hilarious.
4419000	4420000	He's like he's in the woods.
4420000	4421000	It's like there's like OK.
4421000	4423000	He's in that new movie The Cockblockers.
4423000	4424000	Yeah exactly.
4424000	4425000	He's so charismatic.
4425000	4428000	That movie Blockers or whatever which is probably a garbage movie.
4428000	4432000	I saw John Cena and I'm like I probably would watch that.
4432000	4435000	You know it's like he has got the charisma.
4435000	4436000	It's like what.
4436000	4437000	What are you going to do.
4437000	4439000	I mean it's probably an absolute shit movie.
4439000	4443000	But does he have the uniqueness nerve and talent.
4443000	4444000	I don't know.
4444000	4447000	I think that one sailed.
4447000	4449000	I try I try Jamie I tried.
4449000	4450000	All right.
4450000	4455000	So is that it for news for tonight.
4455000	4456000	Yeah sure why not.
4456000	4457000	All right.
4457000	4459000	Well it is a shorter news.
4459000	4460000	Oh you got one more.
4460000	4461000	No I've just been reading.
4461000	4464000	I finished a World of Warcraft novel.
4464000	4465000	Oh one of the Christie Golden books.
4465000	4467000	Yeah because I really love her writing.
4467000	4472000	And I was really pissed because I actually want more newer stuff and there aren't any newer books.
4472000	4473000	Which which book.
4473000	4475000	I finished war crimes.
4475000	4476000	OK.
4476000	4482000	And it was honestly because you keep in mind I didn't finish the pandaria stuff.
4482000	4485000	So it was actually kind of cool and I thought it was a really well-written book.
4485000	4487000	I really enjoy reading what she writes.
4487000	4493000	So and I want more and I'm kind of pissed off that there wasn't more because I wasn't interested in anything else.
4493000	4498000	Because the only book that came out after that was the Illidan novel and it was more of a backtracking.
4498000	4499000	It was a good book.
4499000	4500000	Right.
4500000	4503000	But I want more like current stuff.
4503000	4506000	OK. So one quick thing I was going to mention.
4506000	4508000	So they did.
4508000	4512000	There's some news regarding blood stain.
4512000	4517000	So they are talking about that they're never going to be announcing a release window pretty soon.
4517000	4522000	But they did announce their US or the English voice cast for it.
4522000	4528000	So let's see they've got Erica Lindbeck for the character Miriam.
4528000	4533000	And she was like persona five League of Legends Street Fighter five.
4533000	4539000	This guy you might recognize his name as the character Zangetsu David Hayter.
4539000	4541000	Hey.
4541000	4545000	Then you've got Ray Chase who does Gebel I guess.
4545000	4552000	And he was in Final Fantasy 15 as Noctis and Nier Automata.
4552000	4555000	Also looks like Ben Diskin who's that Jonas.
4555000	4561000	He was in looks like Halo 4 as Jared Miller and some of the Naruto games.
4561000	4563000	The coach man Fred.
4563000	4568000	Tap this gory and he's a soldier 76 in Overwatch.
4568000	4573000	Also a sarin artists in Mass Effect I guess.
4573000	4576000	Sirens are as my friend calls them saran wrap.
4576000	4578000	Freda Wolf who's Dominique.
4578000	4584000	She's in Mass Effect Andromeda Sarah Ryder and I didn't know there were this many characters in blood stain.
4584000	4589000	Yeah Gremory Carrie Walgreen.
4589000	4594000	She was in No More Heroes.
4594000	4600000	Also we've got Ann Arena Strober who's in Persona and Fire Emblem.
4600000	4604000	Who else Christopher Swindle.
4604000	4609000	I'm trying to see if there's any other recognizable names I see.
4610000	4616000	There's only two more here Robbie Belgrade who's in Castlevania Symphony at night as Alucard.
4616000	4620000	And he's also the announcer for Tekken so I mean that's kind of cool.
4620000	4621000	Oh wow I didn't know that.
4621000	4627000	And then finally we've got let's see Jamie Mortell.
4627000	4629000	I'm going to butcher his last name.
4629000	4634000	Mortellero and he's the director for the voice acting.
4634000	4638000	He did Silent Hill Shattered Memories Halo 4 and EverQuest 2.
4638000	4644000	Well I'm excited I'll finally get my Kickstarter pledge to get that free copy of Bloodstained.
4644000	4652000	Yeah they said there's going to be a beta backer demo that's going to be available June 2018 and announcing the release of the game.
4652000	4654000	So finally this year it sounds like.
4654000	4655000	Maybe.
4655000	4656000	Exciting.
4656000	4657000	Exciting times.
4657000	4659000	Alright well that is about going to do it for another episode of Orange Daunt Radio.
4659000	4663000	I know it was short this week but that's because we're a little unplugged a little off the record this week.
4663000	4667000	But we wanted to give you something to hold you over while we're on a little bit of a live break.
4667000	4679000	But we will be back live April the 8th with the next episode of our show and a full length show with your calls with your emails and with you in our chat at live.vog.net.com.
4679000	4684000	But as I do say at the end of every episode if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Daunt Radio please help us spread the word.
4684000	4688000	We are the show where every gamer has a voice but only if the voices are here to participate.
4688000	4693000	So a nice five star review on iTunes goes a long way or Google Play or wherever it is you found this show.
4693000	4698000	And then of course tell a friend or two that all helps that word of mouth is so so important.
4698000	4702000	And I think on that note it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
4702000	4703000	Dark Sakura enjoy the movie tonight.
4703000	4704000	What's your final thought.
4704000	4709000	Yeah we're going to go see Pacific Rim 2 just because giant robots and kaiju.
4709000	4710000	And John Boyega is in it right.
4710000	4715000	Yeah the only thing that makes me a little bit iffy about it is because it's not done by Del Toro.
4715000	4716000	The last movie was so good.
4716000	4719000	I really think they should have been the Mako Mori movie but you know whatever.
4719000	4723000	I hear it's stupid but I also hear it's really action packed and awesome.
4723000	4724000	It's fun.
4724000	4726000	I mean but that was the first one too.
4726000	4727000	Get some popcorn.
4727000	4731000	The first one had Ron Perlman in it and I love anything.
4731000	4733000	I haven't actually seen the Hellboy movies which I want to.
4733000	4734000	But I love Ron Perlman.
4734000	4737000	I want to see the new one with the guy from Stranger Things.
4737000	4741000	He's like eh different guy than Ron Perlman I'm not sure if I can get on board with that.
4741000	4743000	And I was like OK I can get on board with that.
4743000	4745000	I didn't even know there was a new one but.
4745000	4747000	Yeah they're rebooting it.
4747000	4750000	Of course they're rebooting every fucking thing.
4750000	4751000	Of course.
4751000	4755000	Today was the 30th anniversary of Beetlejuice and they're talking about Beetlejuice 2 and.
4755000	4756000	No.
4756000	4757000	No.
4757000	4758000	No.
4758000	4759000	No they are talking about it I'm just saying no.
4759000	4760000	No.
4760000	4761000	But then they also.
4761000	4763000	The only one I'm interested in is Sheetaljuice.
