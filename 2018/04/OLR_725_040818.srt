Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This week, amidst the upper-overport pixel smoothing, Square Enix announces that graphic style will soon become a choice for Chrono Trigger.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is just one story in a night full of news. Welcome back to a regularly scheduled and live episode of the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are live once again, and welcome back to another episode of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Episode number 725 for this, April the 8th of 2018. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter as Skie, S-K-I-E.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And I'm joined, as always, to talk about video games with the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Mr. Smush made the best noise.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Mr. Smush is the resident cat, by the way, if you didn't know. He's my son. He's my three-year-old baby.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He makes little noises like a piggy because he has the smush face. That's actually not why he's called Mr. Smush, it helps.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But I called him Mr. Smush because, okay, Sanrio, our old cat who passed, when you would like pet her and she really loved you, she would lick. She'd lick, lick, lick. She'd lick your fingers.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Mr. Smush, what he does, if he loves you and you put your hand out, he'll just ram his whole face into your hand.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He also does that, too.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, so I was like, oh, he's a smushing kitty, so I called him Mr. Smush.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You know, every cat, though, that my friends have, I give a nickname, too.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Do you?

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He's Smushy.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Smushy? It's derivative.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
My friend Susan's cat, Pantera, not after the band, but because it means panther.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay, I still like Pantera after the band.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Her nickname is Miss Pants.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Sanrio, I called Sanchan, or old lady.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Old lady. That was a good one.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But anyway, I want to say what was hilarious about it is right when this show music starts, Mr. Smush comes in here and plops up on the guest, which is usually our guest chair, this very old chair I've had in my family for a long time.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He plops up on the chair. All he needs is a microphone. I guess we could give him one.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Should I give Mr. Smush a microphone?

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I was just thinking it was his regal throne.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Would you all be bothered by random cat noises if I give Mr. Smush a microphone?

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Here we go.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I wouldn't be.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Mr. Smush, if you have anything to say, you just say it right into that microphone.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Unless he pulls, you know, cat assholeness and knocks it down.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, he's going to knock it down. When do you guys hear that big thud later on?

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's Mr. Smush.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's Mr. Smush peacing out.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's his opinion.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
All right.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hey, speaking of opinions, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hello.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How are you? How are you?

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm good. I'm having spicy salsa.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So my tongue's on fire.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What do you need to drink?

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But it's so much better than the Pico, so.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
All right, you need to drink.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Better to have your tongue on fire than your ass on fire.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is true.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I felt like you were trying to get a thought out there.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, hey.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I hopped over to Loki.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Random observation. I noticed that you have taken your arcade cabinets out of the Roxas.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, yes. Let's talk about that.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So my little arcade cabinet collection, which really is Jamie's, like, helped me build this significantly because she found these little, they're called arcade minis and they're available, but they're only available.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Playing Dan.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They're only available at Wal-Mart and I think Amazon.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Wal-Mart.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But Jamie saw them all at Wal-Mart, so she texted me like, do you want them? I'm like, heck yeah.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So she got me five of these seven machines that are up here.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And so I have these tiny little mini arcade cabinets with Pac-Man, Centipede, Rampage, Joust, Qbert, Frogger and Asteroids.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So there's a story behind this, though.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, go for it.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Dan took me to four different Wal-Marts looking for these fuckers.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I was like, I don't want to go to Wal-Mart. I don't want to go to Wal-Mart.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So as I'm driving home, there's a Wal-Mart that Dan hasn't been to because he doesn't really have a reason to, so I just stopped randomly.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Because you can buy fabric and I was looking at the crafty stuff, but they had them.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So that's when I texted you and I told Dan that they had them, so I bought the first two of the LCD screens.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I didn't get the crappy screens.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Which I want to say was Qbert and Centipede.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, I think those were the first two you got me, yeah.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Which is funny because we've kind of been on a Qbert kick.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And then...

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And honestly, of those machines, here's the thing.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Even though they're all in the same collection or whatever, like there's...

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They're all emulated.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, sort of. See, here's the thing. The early, early Pac-Man and Space Invaders were the first two in the collection.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They're not that great. They're basically game and watches.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Meaning they have the burned-in, you know...

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
LED.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah, LED thing. Or LCD.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
LCD.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
LCD. Where it's already like burned in and stuff. So it's like Mr. Game and Watch.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, that's what it looks like. And they're not very good.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And then the new Pac-Man and Asteroids, kind of the same thing.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Just a color version of them.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Just a color version of Pac-Man. So they're also not very good.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But the other ones... I only got those for completion's sake.

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The other ones like Joust and Qbert and Rampage, they all use like little emulated like either like ColecoVision or Atari. I don't know what versions.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The version of Qbert actually, if I am correct, it is a modified version of the ColecoVision version.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I want to see if the noise will actually come through on the mic. I don't know how well this will be.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Barely.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's loading, loading, loading.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It doesn't really have the music, which is the crappy part.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That was him cursing because I got hit. Anyway, there you go. A little taste of Qbert. Sorry, I thought that had music in it. I guess not.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So it must be an old version.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, if I remember... Well, I mean, believe it or not, I still have my ColecoVision.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And we've played Qbert on it a couple of times. And it has like a little bit of the...

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You know, so it does have a little bit of music, but that's why I think that this one's a modified version.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Because Qbert actually looks right. He doesn't have the vacant eyes.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Right. And Dr. Suya says, I want to see Qbert as Konami's NES version. No, the NES version had that little introduction at the level.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I did not care for the... And actually, if you want to see a really good comparison, though, for versions of Qbert.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
One of my favorite channels is... I think it's like Retro Wave, but he does Battle of the Ports.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And he did every home release and arcade release of Qbert.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Side by side. And it's a really good comparison. I really enjoyed this guy's commentary.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
SHJ100Matt says, I saw these things and was considering getting one.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Honestly, they're not bad. I mean, they're kind of hard to play.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I think if I was like younger, if I was a younger kid, I would be super...

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Like your kids, Loki, I would think would be super into this.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Because the little joystick for the little hands.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Like anything like that.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah. But for me, they're really hard to play.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And I don't think the Pac-Man and Asteroids are very good, like I said a minute ago.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But the others are... I mean, because they are like little tiny displays.

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Little mini, mini color TVs. They work good.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, I did hook up the arcade cabinet again this week.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because I moved it to the other side of the garage, plugged it in, and hooked the computer back up to it.

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Problem is, I get no display on it now.

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Which I'm not surprised, because the way they built it...

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Basically, since it is an arcade machine, normally you have the boards screwed down to an actual piece of wood that slides in and out of the cabinet.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So it's easy to kind of put it in there.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But the graphics card that I have is just kind of... There's nothing really holding it into the board.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It just kind of wobbles around in there.

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I did try to brace it up with some brackets, but it never was in there very well.

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And I think something broke there.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And it's a really old graphics card too that may have broken.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So I have to test it on another monitor first to make sure it's actually working.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And it may just be simply replacing the graphics card, which I have dozens of them in my garage.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That won't be a problem.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And I can actually replace it with a better graphics card.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I was hoping I wouldn't have to do that, because everything was already set up and nice.

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's just, you know, whatever.

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Anyway, I'm looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Ragenator says, if I recall correctly, the first arcade game that I ever played was Popeye.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's a great throwback game.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
People forget about Popeye, I think, from the 80s.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Nintendo did the arcade cabs for that too, if I remember right.

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I had the Coleco version.

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, that was a great little 80s platformer that kind of disappeared with time.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Probably because of the license.

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
With contemporaries though, I still preferred Kangaroo over Popeye.

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I was still a Popeye fan, but that's because of my Commodore 64 connection,

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
because that's one of the earliest things I remember playing on Commodore 64 was Popeye.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It was a Parker Brothers C64 cartridge.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
They had a very unique shape.

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
My first arcade game I want to say was Pac-Man,

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
because I have a vague memory of being three and being held up by my mom's boyfriend to play it.

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I want to say I have these two conflicting memories.

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm not sure which one was first.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
My mic wasn't on, I think.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No, you were fine.

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It was either Tempest at a young age.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I remember playing Tempest at a very young age with the little dial that spins.

160
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And then also another unique controller.

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I have a distinct remember of being at a Chuck E. Cheese in the 80s when my sister got married.

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I would have been like four or five years old, and I remember playing Crystal Castles.

163
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I remember that being one of the earliest games that I played in the arcade.

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Actually, I like that we're bringing up old arcade games.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And by the way, a proper shout out to our chat room,

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of the Geeks network of vogganetwork.com,

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And let me just say, it is great to be back tonight after essentially three weeks,

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
because we were gone two weeks ago because I was out at Bobby Black Wolf's wedding.

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And then last week was Easter, which I hope you guys had a great day off.

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We got a little sunburned.

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah, I heard.

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But we raised a lot of money for a charity.

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Congrats.

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And I got to meet all kinds of sisters.

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Good.

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Including one of my inspirations, Sister Berenze.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, I know Sister Berenze.

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You met Roma, right?

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, yeah.

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I love Sister Roma because of the Facebook campaign.

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I thanked her for that one.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Sister Roma is actually the first sister I ever met in 2006 at the Castro Street Fair.

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And for those that don't know, just a quick background.

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Jamie's part of this organization, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Honestly, the easiest way I could explain it to the broad audience that listens to this show.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What's that?

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Drag nun.

189
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah, basically, if you've ever seen dudes dressed as nuns, although not only dudes, right, Narsara?

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If you've seen dudes dressed as nuns, it was probably them.

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah, been around since the 70s.

192
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So, cool.

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And Sister Roma is one of the most famous because of the Facebook campaign where, you know,

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
you should not have to use your real name.

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Which I don't use my real name on Facebook and I shouldn't have to.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But if you go look on the World of Wonder YouTube channel, you can find Sister Roma

197
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and Sister Berenze doing besties for cash.

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
How else will they be able to get accurate information for all their analytics that they're

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
leaking to the world?

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I know, right?

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Right about now, I'm real happy I used a fake name.

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Thanks.

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But anyway, not to distract.

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What were you going to mention before the Easter thing?

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Do you remember?

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I guess not.

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And it was something that would have been important, but I forgot.

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let me quickly read a couple more memories from our chat room.

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let's see.

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Ragenator says, I never played the NES version.

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It wasn't until I had a PS3 when I finally played a home version of Qbert.

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, sorry.

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Dartesuja says, I vaguely remember my first arcade game.

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I remember going to Bullwinkles and that was still a thing.

215
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I love Bullwinkles.

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Like, I remember a Noah's Ark game randomly, though.

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
There was a Noah's Ark game.

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I remember the mineshaft here had it locally.

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That place was awesome when it was...

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I love Bullwinkles.

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Probably better than Chuck E. Cheese.

222
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't think I ever went to Bullwinkles.

223
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We never had one where I lived.

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Bullwinkles is a Bay Area thing, right?

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He was.

226
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah.

227
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But I did remember, and this is, and to this day I still suck at Frogger if I'm not wearing

228
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
roller skates, but I would go to the Babalu in Dothan, Alabama when I was there to visit

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
my daddy and my granny.

230
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And the Babalu was owned by a man named Bob and his wife, Lou.

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But Bob taught skating with my granddaddy, so he knew who I was and would always play

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
the songs I'd ask.

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But I would play a ton of Frogger and early pinball on roller skates.

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It was the only way I could play certain things is on roller skates to this day.

235
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So, just saying.

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Good time.

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I remember playing Spy Hunter on roller skates.

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Anyway.

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Well, since we're talking about old games, that actually leads into a little bit of the

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
kickoff topic I want to talk about tonight.

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I do want to give a shout out, though, to PAX East.

242
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I was hoping to maybe get somebody on the show who'd been to PAX East this weekend,

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
but my Twitter calls went unanswered.

244
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But to be fair, I didn't think of it until the last minute, and a lot of people are probably

245
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
traveling back from PAX East right now.

246
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But if you didn't go to PAX East, I hope you had a great time.

247
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I haven't been in, what was the last time I went?

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
2014, I think?

249
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
My years start to blur together.

250
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Whatever year the snowmageddon was, like, two weeks before PAX East.

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That was the last year I went.

252
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And, you know, it's getting to be a real crowded show, but it was always a good time.

253
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So, you know, hope people that went had a good time.

254
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So I just want to get that out there.

255
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But what I do want to talk about here at the top of the show, I want to talk a little bit about old school.

256
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And I want to talk about homebrew developments for old school consoles.

257
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And when I say old school, how about the Mattel Intellivision?

258
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Y'all remember the Intellivision?

259
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Because they keep milking the Intellivision later on for retro collections and all that, right?

260
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
With the Intellivision Lives was a game at one point.

261
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They had the Flashback console.

262
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
In fact, I think I actually own that one, the Intellivision Flashback.

263
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, the reason why I bring back up the Intellivision is that just recently there was a new game released for the Intellivision.

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's right, Princess Lydie.

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I hope I'm saying that right.

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But Princess Lydie is kind of like a Snow Brothers, a Bubble Bobble-esque type of game that was released for the Intellivision.

267
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And yeah, so you can check that out. The game is freely available.

268
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But of course, you know, the developer would always appreciate a little bit of support if you do like that.

269
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The game was created with Inti Basic, which is a basic interpreter for the Mattel Intellivision.

270
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You can actually see, here's a little gif here in studio of the game in motion there.

271
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So you can check that out.

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There's more information over at the Atari Age forums.

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Atariage.com.

274
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And Bobby's asking for a spelling of that, so you can Google it.

275
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Absolutely. It's Princess L-Y-D-I-E.

276
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Princess Lydie? How about Lydie? Because it has die in it.

277
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So, L-Y-D-I-E.

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Maybe it's Lydie.

279
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Lydie? I mean, I almost said Lydia, but Lydie? Oh well.

280
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Anyway, there you go. You can check out that old game.

281
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And why I thought I'd bring that up is kind of a two-part question here is that

282
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Why do you think these old, old consoles still thrive with new releases and new games?

283
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What do you think possesses people to make games for the Intellivision when

284
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I would say very few people have those hooked up to their TVs anymore?

285
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's the big N-word. Nostalgia.

286
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Nostalgia? Nintendo? Nintendo Nostalgia?

287
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Just Nostalgia.

288
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Nostalgia. Something about that.

289
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Jamie, do you play any of these remakes, or I guess demakes if you will?

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Or old, old games on systems?

291
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Like Halo 2600. Did you give that a try?

292
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No. No.

293
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What do you think about the fact that new games still come out?

294
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I had the Bayonetta down make.

295
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh yeah, that was cool.

296
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That was pretty fun. That was very cool.

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Fantaz says, make a new Grand Theft Auto for Atari 2600.

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Funny enough, that's actually how Retro City Rampage started.

299
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It was a Grand Theft Auto game for the NES, a demake.

300
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And then it just kind of blew up from there.

301
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I would love for them to do the, I guess, emulator that they did for building Breath of the Wild.

302
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh yeah.

303
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Wouldn't that be nice?

304
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah.

305
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'd play the shit out of it.

306
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That'll never see the light of day, but you never know.

307
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Well let me ask, and speaking of, okay, let's talk about demakes.

308
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Because remakes are all the rage, right?

309
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
We had Crash Bandicoot just got a remaster.

310
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There's another one I'm sure you all are thinking of that we'll talk about a little later on tonight.

311
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Heck, even the Halo trilogy got re-released on the Xbox One, right?

312
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Actually, I think it was four Halo games that were re-released on Xbox One.

313
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So anyway, all that aside, what game do you think should be demade?

314
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What game do you think they need to revisit and do an old version of for an old console?

315
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And I open this to the chatters as well.

316
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Halo 2600 would be an example of this.

317
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The Bayonetta demake that they did to promote Bayonetta on stream.

318
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's also another great example of that.

319
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What game do you think should be demade?

320
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Final Fantasy VII for the NES as an example, says Bobby Blackwolf.

321
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Maybe do Final Fantasy VII as a text adventure a la Gemstone.

322
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, a text adventure game, like Zork.

323
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, like Zork.

324
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay, I like that.

325
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What about other...

326
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I think they should do a...

327
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't know why, but my mind goes to what's all the rage right now in gaming.

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I say 1 versus 100.

329
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The player-verse, and I don't mean the game show, sadly.

330
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But the Player Unknown Battlegrounds and Fortnite.

331
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That shit's all the rage right now.

332
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So I would like to see a 100 versus 1 type of game, unlike the NES.

333
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Like a party game.

334
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You have to have a lot of multi-depths.

335
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So what was that like?

336
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Hide and go seek.

337
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It was something... I remember the name now.

338
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It was like Xeno... Xenophobe?

339
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Was it Xenophobe?

340
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
There was one that had a top and a bottom screen,

341
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and you could see different things going on.

342
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, okay, so there was a game called Xenophobe,

343
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and it was actually three layers in the arcade,

344
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
because it was a three-player game, and it was a side-scroller.

345
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And the thing that made that game very novel

346
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
was that all three people were in the spaceport somewhere,

347
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and all kind of like... I guess, yeah.

348
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So it was kind of like fighting.

349
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You know what game also that draws to mind?

350
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You know what game Xenophobe was a lot like?

351
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Spy versus Spy.

352
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Remember that one?

353
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And that was just two people,

354
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
but that was very much like a split-screen thing,

355
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and you would try to hide the booby traps.

356
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So okay, go with that.

357
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So Spy versus Spy, but like 100 people.

358
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That would be fun.

359
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah.

360
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
There you go.

361
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Let's see.

362
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

363
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Alan Alchemy suggests BeatMania 2DX 2600.

364
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Played with the paddle.

365
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Get it? Because it's a turntable and a button.

366
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I like that. That's a good idea.

367
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
DJ Hero has been demade.

368
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Well, DJ Hero was.

369
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
DJ Hero was? For what system?

370
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
PC. It looked like a NES version.

371
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. You're right.

372
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
They did like a promo thing for that.

373
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Jamie, were you about to say something?

374
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Parappa.

375
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Parappa the Rapper?

376
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The reason why I'm thinking about it is because

377
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
there was the scene where he goes into the cartridge,

378
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and the worse you do, the worse the graphics get.

379
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You know, it degrades by 8 bits each time.

380
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And I was going to say, demade BeatMania.

381
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That's basically the Game Boy Color version of the game.

382
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Ah.

383
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
WonderSwan version.

384
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Dr. Buster says, I'd play Final Fantasy 13 again

385
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
if it was turned into a 16-bit Super Nintendo game,

386
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
like their Lightning Returns trailer.

387
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You know, they did a little joke with Final Fantasy 14

388
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and that as well, where they had a group fighting Titan,

389
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and it was really funny because the Dragoon

390
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
fell off the stage because it's kind of poking fun

391
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
at Dragoons being bad.

392
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Fine, and I want Final Fantasy 14 done like

393
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Fantasy Star Online.

394
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So like, maybe the Dreamcast.

395
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Sia Tabiri in chat says, Tiger,

396
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't know if that's a throwback at the old LCD games,

397
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Five Nights at Freddy's.

398
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That's pretty good. I like that.

399
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And that would work, like just the little hallways

400
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
being on the LCD screen.

401
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
On the game.com. I'm sorry, game.com.

402
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I like that Five Nights at Freddy's is a great choice

403
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
because so many sequences in that game are already retro,

404
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
like some of the storytelling.

405
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Have you seen the trailer for Outlast for the Switch?

406
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
No.

407
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So they did like a trailer and there's like this dude

408
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
sitting in the cafe, all of a sudden there's like a jump scare

409
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
and he's like, ah!

410
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Looking around like everyone's like, the fuck, dude?

411
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Nice.

412
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says there was also Guitar Hero 2

413
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
that's played more like Audio Surf.

414
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah, so that's, okay.

415
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So, any other demakes you guys want to get out there

416
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
before we move on with the game?

417
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm trying to think of other stuff that's really big right now.

418
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's funny because I keep thinking of Minecraft,

419
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
but Minecraft already has that look of an old game,

420
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
although it's 3D, so it's not old.

421
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What if Minecraft was done kind of like Doom style?

422
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Where it was all pixel done in 3D?

423
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I was like, that's kind of how it looks already.

424
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But it is actually 3D, like all of your characters are just 2D flat.

425
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh, okay, I see what you mean.

426
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And your extra assets are 2D flat.

427
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's Terraria.

428
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But Terraria is like side view.

429
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Wolfenstein 3D is a good example because that was a 2D game

430
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
in three dimensions.

431
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Right, or like Hexen or Heretic.

432
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Okay, I see where you're going.

433
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You know, all those id software games.

434
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
MXC brings up a good point.

435
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Brazil has a lot of demakes due to the continued popularity

436
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
of Sega Genesis.

437
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And Sega Master System is the big thing.

438
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I think they finally moved on to Genesis.

439
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But a lot of games that came out on Genesis and later systems

440
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
actually have Master System ports.

441
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You can only get them in Brazil.

442
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You know, and sometimes we forget being that we're in the US

443
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and so we're one of the countries that tends to get stuff

444
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
right when they come out.

445
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
There's a whole globe here,

446
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and a lot of these countries in South America

447
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and other parts of the world too,

448
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
they don't necessarily get stuff.

449
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Like, you know, the PlayStation 4.

450
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Did Mr. Smoosh finally knock the mic over?

451
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Mr. Smoosh knocked it over.

452
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He had it.

453
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
All right, anyway, so a lot of these other countries

454
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
don't have stuff right away.

455
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So they have to kind of...

456
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I bet there's a big, like, secondhand market too.

457
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Like, I bet like GameStop, like the overage shit they can't sell,

458
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
they probably send to other countries

459
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
or they, you know, sell it to places in these other countries.

460
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Well, and the other thing too is that the cost of import

461
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
for some of the newer systems is so great

462
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
that it ended up being more cost effective

463
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
to downgrade some of the games.

464
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I mean, like, there's, I think, two iterations of Sonic the Hedgehog

465
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
other than the Game Gear one

466
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
that came out on Master System only in Brazil.

467
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You know, we've got...

468
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We emulated a few of them.

469
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I mean, they're pretty fun, but still.

470
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah.

471
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Fantasm Chat says,

472
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I know people from Brazil.

473
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Everything is so expensive there, it's ridiculous.

474
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
A hundred plus dollars for a game.

475
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah, I'm sure with all the importing, you know, fees

476
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and then people want a cut of that and so forth,

477
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm sure it's, you know, if the company doesn't officially exist there,

478
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
then you're basically paying import surcharges on everything,

479
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
so I'm sure it gets crazy.

480
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
All right, anyway.

481
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay, that was a fun little conversation

482
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
since I know remakes are all the rage right now to talk about remakes.

483
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Actually, speaking of Halo 2600, I did watch the making of that.

484
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Like, there was, like, someone did a documentary on it

485
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
about how it was a guy at Rare, or not Rare, at Bungie

486
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
that basically, like, I just want to mess around

487
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
with making a game for the 2600.

488
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It doesn't matter what it is,

489
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and then you end up just drawing Master Chief.

490
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Showed it to somebody, like, dude, you got to make that.

491
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You got to make the whole game.

492
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And so eventually, you know, you worked on it with some other people

493
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
to help, you know, build the sprites and everything.

494
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You know, going back to the earlier question on why demakes,

495
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I bet the challenge is it for a lot of people.

496
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah.

497
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Because, you know, programming an Atari 2600 game,

498
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
like, you really have to, you can't write bloated code.

499
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I hope he knows how to write assembly.

500
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah, right.

501
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You really, I mean, that's maybe a good way to, like, practice and stuff.

502
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I would have no idea how to do that stuff.

503
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yeah, it's extremely challenging.

504
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And, like, I think it took the guy, like, a few years just to make it.

505
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Wow.

506
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It was just, it was more of just, like,

507
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I want to challenge myself to be able to do this.

508
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But some people do it for the thrill.

509
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yeah.

510
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm not one of those people that will ever do that for the thrill.

511
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Somebody in chat was saying very tongue-in-cheek

512
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
that you should demake It's Time to Car,

513
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
except you'd have to actually make it first.

514
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh, it's already demade.

515
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's already in the trash compactor.

516
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
All right.

517
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Let's talk a little more about some modern games.

518
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Maybe, as we travel around our gaming weeks

519
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and the types of video games that we've been playing this week,

520
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and I say maybe because, I don't know,

521
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
maybe Dar Sacra went on a retro binge.

522
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
She does that sometimes.

523
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
How was your gaming week, Dar Sacra?

524
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I bought more than I played.

525
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I bought that.

526
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That's just a Monday.

527
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I bought Valhalla, finally.

528
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Or the VA11, whatever, how it's spelled.

529
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I also got Res HD, or whatever the remake was on Steam,

530
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
but I haven't played it yet.

531
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I went to the thrift store, found just a stack as tall as I am,

532
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
practically, of Xbox 360 games in really great condition.

533
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Ask me later which Goodwill I went to.

534
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And a bunch of PS3 games.

535
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So I picked up Ni No Kuni for PS3,

536
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and I picked up an unwrapped copy of Titanfall for Xbox 360.

537
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It was obviously some bro's collection

538
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
because there were a lot of Gears of War and all that in there.

539
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I played some Pokemon Go.

540
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I played a lot of Animal Crossing.

541
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
We, finally, I think, are done with Zelda.

542
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
We loaned Julie in our Wii U so he can finally play it.

543
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh, that's cute.

544
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah.

545
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And I played a bunch of Pinball

546
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
because we played a four-person versus game on Medieval Madness.

547
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And that was really fun.

548
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And played some World Cup Soccer and played some Black Knight 2000.

549
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
My Star Trek is broken.

550
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Oh, no.

551
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Upset.

552
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
But we might actually sell it.

553
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I mean, it'd give us like $8,000 back in our bank, so that'd be nice.

554
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Oh, no, I didn't really play much else, I think,

555
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
because I had a Passover Seder to get ready for.

556
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So it was crazy.

557
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I heard it was successful, so congrats.

558
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It was.

559
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
There were 13 people apart from myself.

560
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Nice.

561
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
That's a party.

562
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
As a party.

563
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That is a party.

564
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
There was so many people stuffed into my kitchen.

565
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
All right, let me move on to Loki and your gaming week.

566
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So I saw Ready Player One again.

567
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Of course you did.

568
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And no one surprised.

569
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yes.

570
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I just thought about myself.

571
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And Jamie and I are talking about going this week and Loki's like,

572
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Ooh, win.

573
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Like, of course you can come, Loki.

574
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Let's figure it out.

575
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So I did that.

576
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And then I did play Far Cry 4 or 5.

577
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I thought 5 was the new one.

578
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Okay.

579
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah, Far Cry 5.

580
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Does it have like a huge map or something?

581
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's a pretty big map,

582
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
but I haven't actually been playing too much of Far Cry 5.

583
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I've been playing the Far Cry arcade stuff.

584
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So I've been doing that.

585
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And I've been doing this arcade hero mode,

586
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
which is basically, hey, play these maps that no one plays so you can rate them.

587
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And they've all been terrible.

588
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
But it's been just fun just going through the terrible maps

589
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
because you also earn double experience.

590
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And the experience you earn in that and the perk points and stuff

591
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
go into the main game too.

592
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So like if I, it's an easy way to just earn,

593
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
like because the aim's kind of hard right now.

594
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And so I just grinded that for a while.

595
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And then, oh, hey, look at all these perks I unlocked.

596
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And it makes the game easier when I actually go back and play Far Cry 5.

597
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But I did actually play some Far Cry 5 as well

598
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
because I was trying to get to this one way point on there, like this prison.

599
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And so I had to drive through all this area with a bunch of bad guys and stuff.

600
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And so there was this hunter, this hunting spot that you can go to.

601
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And so I went up to the hunter or whatever,

602
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and then she gets attacked by a mountain lion.

603
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And so then I waited for the mountain lion to kill her,

604
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and then I killed the mountain lion.

605
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And I got to loot both of them. So win-win.

606
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And then of course more DDR. What was it?

607
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm down 16 pounds now.

608
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And I've been playing...

609
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Congrats, by the way.

610
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I've been playing doubles again.

611
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So I'm playing mostly doubles and doing non-stops of doubles.

612
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I've been finding that doing random caprice every time,

613
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
which is that kind of it's like you can see which songs they are,

614
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
but it's different every time you play it.

615
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That's been all right.

616
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Anytime I try to do random all, you know, it's just like,

617
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Oh, hey, let's throw in Trip Machine Survivor.

618
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Okay, that's cool. You passed that.

619
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Now let's throw Legend of Max in there.

620
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's like, what the fuck? I mean, seriously.

621
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Can you just mix it up a bit instead of boss song, boss song, boss song?

622
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So it's just, I don't know.

623
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And then like I said, I was setting up my arcade cabinet.

624
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And unfortunately the something with the graphics card I think is broken.

625
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So I get no image on the screen.

626
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Hopefully it's not the actual screen that's broken.

627
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I don't think so.

628
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'd be more likely to believe it's the PC

629
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
because that graphics card is like wiggling all around in there.

630
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So I would not be surprised in the least that something's broken there.

631
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So I had to kind of play around, hook it up to some different monitors

632
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
to see if I can actually see an image and try to troubleshoot that.

633
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But I just thought I would set that up since it's just been sitting in a corner gathering dust.

634
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And eventually I'll probably sell it.

635
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Because I did promise I would do that when I got the DDR machine.

636
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So I'll have to do that because I haven't been playing it.

637
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And that's pretty much it.

638
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Okay. Let me talk about my gaming week.

639
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Still some old favorites.

640
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Been playing Pokemon Go.

641
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Finally caught a Latios at one of the raids over the weekend.

642
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So that was good.

643
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Let's see, also still playing Overwatch.

644
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Having fun with that.

645
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Been playing a lot of Mystery Heroes.

646
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Kind of getting back into that.

647
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I feel like I'm just doing better.

648
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Knock on wood.

649
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But I feel like I'm just getting some good matches.

650
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And I'm winning as much as I'm losing.

651
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And that feels nice.

652
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That's where I want to be is an even win-loss ratio.

653
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And continuing to play some Heroes of the Storm and Final Fantasy XIV.

654
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And some of the newer things that I've continued on recently.

655
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Ni No Kuni 2 I'm still playing.

656
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I have been streaming all of my gameplay.

657
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm up to about eight and a half hours in.

658
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And all of it's been streamed over on my Twitch stream.

659
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Cheap plug, Rob Roberts.

660
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But I'm really enjoying Ni No Kuni 2.

661
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It's different from the first game.

662
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Like the battle system is completely different.

663
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And there's this whole kingdom management system thing that kind of feels like a mobile phone game.

664
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But it's also not because the things you do to grow your kingdom are not necessarily paying 99 cents.

665
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
There's no money transactions in the game like that.

666
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But it's actually go do this quest.

667
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And then you'll get another person to join your kingdom.

668
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And I kind of like that.

669
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It's like Actraiser.

670
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Kind of in that regard.

671
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
A lot of people comparing it to Suikoden.

672
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Where you try to get all the people to convince them to join your kingdom.

673
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
A lot of people comparing it to that.

674
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
But yeah, I'm enjoying that and all the side questing.

675
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So I'm going to continue to stream that. Play more of that.

676
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm having a lot of fun with that game.

677
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And I did not beat the first game.

678
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And I do not feel like my experience on Ni No Kuni 2 is diminished.

679
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I think it's very much like Final Fantasy.

680
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Where it's just, you know, they are similar in their art style and some of the location names.

681
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But otherwise, probably not connected.

682
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So, there you go.

683
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Let's see.

684
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And other newer stuff I've been playing this week.

685
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I was trying to think. There's one other game I want to talk about.

686
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Oh, I lost my train of thought.

687
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
What else did I play this week?

688
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
There was a new...

689
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Oh, I want to talk about DJ Max.

690
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Because I was just playing that earlier today actually before the show.

691
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Because DJ Max Respect actually had some new DLC released for it.

692
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So now they have the Classic Y edition.

693
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You can get all those songs, which is great.

694
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
They have a Technica expansion pack.

695
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So yeah, I'm loving that.

696
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Because all those songs are really good.

697
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Especially the Classic Y pack.

698
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Like if you have DJ Max, you want to get the Classic Y pack.

699
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It almost actually makes me want to go back and alter maybe what I said a little bit a couple weeks ago on OLR.

700
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
About how DJ Max... I didn't really care for the music as much as I did in BeatMania 2DX.

701
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Because these expansion packs and these DLC music packs are really good.

702
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Like the songs are really good in the DLC packs.

703
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Even though they're not necessarily licensed things.

704
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I hear that the developers are not super happy with the performance of the game in the West.

705
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I think you need to strongly consider...

706
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I mean, they're probably having to pay a license fee for some of these DLC.

707
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So you might want to consider bundling some of it in.

708
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Or you might want to consider really dropping the cost on the base game.

709
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I think if the base game came down to $20, probably more people would pick it up.

710
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And then you could probably make some more money off these DLC expansions.

711
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That would be my advice to the developers.

712
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
$50, digitally only.

713
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's a lot to ask for what is essentially kind of an itch thing.

714
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I paid it because I like music games.

715
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And I realize it's a very well-rounded game.

716
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But it might be a hard sell on a greater scale otherwise.

717
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah, that's I guess about it for my gaming week.

718
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So, cool.

719
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You can follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

720
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

721
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
As far as any housekeeping, we should be having shows pretty solid over the next couple months.

722
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
We took a nice little two-week break there.

723
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So we should be having shows right up at least through our 16th anniversary show in mid-June.

724
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So, just kind of a random train of thought here.

725
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I know we're in April right now.

726
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
When is the indie arcade? Isn't that like right around this time?

727
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm not sure they're doing it this year, actually.

728
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I have not seen any of the promotion for it. You're right.

729
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It would have been around this weekend.

730
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I do know that Bree actually had a baby.

731
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh, yeah.

732
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah, so I think just probably, you know, I know she worked really hard to put all that together.

733
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Certainly Gabe did stuff too, but he actually released his game and so forth.

734
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So, I think they probably just put it on pause for this year.

735
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
As far as saying no, I haven't heard anything official.

736
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Yeah, that's definitely fine. I was like, oh shit, did I forget about it?

737
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It would have been around this time, yeah.

738
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So, I think it didn't happen this year.

739
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So, we'll just hope it comes back this year.

740
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It gives me more time to work on a game.

741
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That's right.

742
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
There you go.

743
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
That's right. You can plan for next year. Absolutely right.

744
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Also, I know they had the collaborative office space that they had here.

745
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Yeah, yeah.

746
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It actually closed.

747
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Oh, that's sad.

748
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So, yeah, you know.

749
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Those collab office spaces are kind of hard.

750
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It can be.

751
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It can be.

752
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Well, I know the hacker lab downtown does really, really well.

753
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So, maybe there just wasn't enough demand for the second thing.

754
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Well, they're also sponsored by my company as well.

755
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
That probably works.

756
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Our development innovation lab is literally across the street.

757
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
But we will be keeping our eyes on the Sacramento Indie Gamer Collective.

758
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And anything comes up that we need to let you all know about, we will bring it up right here on OLR.

759
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So, cool.

760
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Alright, well, let's get into some gaming news then for the night.

761
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And we'll start with you, Loki.

762
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Alright.

763
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So, Final Fantasy XV.

764
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
The game that I have, and I literally stared at the title card a couple days ago.

765
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm like, I should go back and play that.

766
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Because I've only played like ten minutes of it.

767
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And I really should play it.

768
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And then I went to play Far Cry 5 instead.

769
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So, you know.

770
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But Final Fantasy XV, you know, they were very dedicated to putting out DLC for the game.

771
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And that doesn't look like it's going to quit anytime soon.

772
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
In fact, they even outlined some new episodes that are going to be coming out over the next year for Final Fantasy.

773
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So, four new episodes are scheduled, including some that focus on Ardyn, Lunafreya, Noctis.

774
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And they said that a shorter side story episode as well for Arania Highwind.

775
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And they didn't really say what exactly, you know, any details on that.

776
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But also, I guess, maybe some other multiplayer focused stuff as well.

777
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Some comrades expansions.

778
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So, lots of stuff coming out next year.

779
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Well, I like that they're doing a DLC side story for Arania.

780
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Because, you know, she was a really strong character that seems like she kind of got cut short in a lot of the corners they cut to get the game out in a reasonable time.

781
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And that's, I don't know, that's kind of what bugs me about this whole fact that they've got these continuing, developing things through 2019.

782
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Is I just feel like...

783
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So, when's the game of the year edition going to come?

784
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Or when's the game going to be finished?

785
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So I can play through the story and get the story as it was intended.

786
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But I've been reading these hot takes on Twitter that are like, well, that's a very, you know, it's a very...

787
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I don't even know what word to use.

788
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's a very spoiled perspective because the developers are continuing to support the game all this time after development.

789
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And we should be thankful that more developers are pouring into their game and all this stuff.

790
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And I'm just like, come on.

791
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Like, I fucking hate it when these types of hot takes are meant, are written in a way to make the other side, like, feel bad.

792
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Like, you should feel bad for your opinion that you are hating on this stuff.

793
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Look, I bought Final Fantasy XV when it came out.

794
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
The developers got my money, so I can bitch and moan all I want on my Twitter.

795
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
If you don't want me to feel bad, you should be less of a cunt.

796
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's one of those things where I'm just like, okay.

797
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But I'm frustrated because I went and I played through this whole game and then it's like, oh, we're going to go back and change chapter 13.

798
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's just, it's a problem nowadays.

799
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh, we're going to go back and change this.

800
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's like, could you let me know when the game is just fucking done so I can play the game that's intended?

801
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And that is a problem.

802
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I think with a lot of these big publishers out there, it's like, okay, you get this incentive if you release the game now.

803
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Or, hey, we're forcing the releases now to avoid any penalties.

804
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And then, or you could finish it and release it later.

805
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's like, well, we'll just release it now. We'll patch it later.

806
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It seems to be the mentality of it.

807
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's the new normal.

808
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And it's sad that it's normal because it wasn't like that before.

809
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You had one chance to get it right and it had to be right.

810
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And that was it.

811
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But now it's like, ah, fuck it, whatever.

812
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
We'll just, we'll just fix the bugs as we go along.

813
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Or it's the other extreme like Mass Effect Andromeda where it's like, oh, it didn't do well.

814
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Drop it like a hot potato.

815
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The DLC that was expected, not canceled.

816
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
We'll just write a book about it.

817
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And it's like, okay, well, that's a little, see, I feel a little differently about like DLC and the additional like DLC and that stuff.

818
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Because with a lot of DLC, it's usually like an extra episode.

819
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's a continuation.

820
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It's a separation, especially in Mass Effect.

821
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I thought Mass Effect did this very well, especially the last one they did for Mass Effect 3.

822
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
What was that?

823
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Citadel? Was the name of that very last one they did for Mass Effect 3?

824
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The Citadel was fan service, the DLC.

825
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It was, but I loved it because it really felt like this separate experience from the game that, you know, enhanced the main game.

826
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And some of this in 15 they're doing.

827
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And I don't, you know, that's cool.

828
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And I'm okay with that stuff.

829
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
But it's like the fact that they're going back and continuing to enhance things that are like in the main game.

830
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
That's the stuff that kind of bothers me is it's like, well, then, so you're not done with the main game.

831
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And it just kind of goes back to this whole like, you know, the game took years and years and years to develop.

832
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But we all know the real development didn't happen to the last two years.

833
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And then it was fucking confusing.

834
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh, by the way, you need to watch this short film in order to finally grasp everything.

835
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You don't. I didn't watch the short film.

836
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You don't need to watch it.

837
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Why even release it?

838
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Some of it's like an extra thing, I guess.

839
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Some of it's incorporated into the game itself, I think.

840
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So, there you go.

841
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Dungeonbuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

842
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:05,000
speaking of Final Fantasy 15, watched some Tekken gameplay with Noctis and it's like he totally belongs there.

843
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm not surprised to hear that.

844
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
In Tekken?

845
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Yeah.

846
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Noctis is in Tekken?

847
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah, yeah. Remember that?

848
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
He's announced as a DLC character for Tekken 7.

849
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah.

850
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I mean, that's cool.

851
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah, no, it's cool.

852
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I wouldn't doubt that he probably belongs there.

853
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So, anybody still in, or I guess now that, was it, Dissidia came out, anybody even give a shit about that?

854
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I tried the demo and I could not get into it.

855
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Or, I shouldn't say demo, the open beta or whatever it was they had.

856
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I could not get into it.

857
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Like, it was kind of complicated for a fighting game, which is fine, and I kind of like could have stuck with that,

858
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
but it's just, I was thinking that Dissidia would be like a Tekken type of game with Final Fantasy characters.

859
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's really not that at all.

860
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Yeah.

861
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Yeah, so, I don't know, I just wasn't into it.

862
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Is it too late to hold out host for an Urgats 2?

863
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I mean, because...

864
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Yes.

865
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Oh, damn it.

866
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm not sure that Dissidia is selling very well.

867
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I could be wrong, but I'm not sure it's doing very well, so I'm not sure Square is going to continue this fighting game thing.

868
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So, we'll see.

869
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You know where they should really throw in their efforts, though?

870
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And I would be shocked if they don't try this, at least after Mario Kart comes out for iOS and Android.

871
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
New Chocobo Racing game.

872
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh, man, that I would be on board for, heck yeah.

873
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And I could see them doing that.

874
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Hey, Chocobo Racing.

875
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Put it on mobile.

876
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Hell yeah.

877
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I mean, eh, but you know, hey, if that's what we got to do to get a new one.

878
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Right.

879
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Still, eh, but you know.

880
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
No, I get you, I get you.

881
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So, alright.

882
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Well, let's move on to something else.

883
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Although, I got to say, it's hard because when I do see people playing Final Fantasy XV on stream, I'm always like, oh, I should go and play this again.

884
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Or they can at least make it.

885
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And then they see a story like this and I'm like, oh, yeah, it's not done.

886
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Make like a decent VR thing because that fishing thing is stupid.

887
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Correct.

888
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Alright, anyway, let's talk about Spyro.

889
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That's right, Spyro the Dragon is making a comeback.

890
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
That's pretty exciting.

891
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Just in time for the 20th anniversary of Spyro.

892
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Spyro is going to be coming back in the Spyro Reignited Trilogy.

893
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The Skylander developers Toys for Bob.

894
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
This is what they're doing now because I don't think Skylanders.

895
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Yeah, it's done.

896
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So, Spyro, which makes sense because Spyro was in Skylanders, right?

897
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I think that did happen.

898
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah, it was Spyro in the Skylanders or something like that.

899
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It was Skylanders, Spyro, something or other.

900
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
He was in the very first title.

901
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah.

902
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And then it was like, oh, he's not the focus anymore.

903
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Yeah.

904
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So, anyway, Spyro the Dragon, Spyro 2, Ripto's Rage, and Spyro Year of the Dragon are all going to be in this.

905
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
New remastered graphics and music and all that available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

906
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
The release date, September 21st.

907
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
$39.99 if you want to pre-order it and I'm sure any store is happy to take your money right now for that.

908
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Interesting to note, these original games were actually originally developed by Insomniac Games,

909
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
who are now doing that big Spider-Man game that also got a release date this week, if I'm not mistaken.

910
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Also in September.

911
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I think that's coming up later in the show. I might be spoiling that a little bit.

912
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
But anyway, yeah, so that's something else to look forward to.

913
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So, what do you guys think about Spyro coming back?

914
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I'm more excited about this than Crash Bandicoot, actually.

915
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I've never played a Spyro game.

916
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Really?

917
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Really?

918
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I was never into it.

919
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I played the first two, I think.

920
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
They were solid platformers.

921
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
The first one was one of the first games I bought on the original PlayStation and I think that's why I'm excited to try this.

922
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
3D cutting-edge graphics for the time, yeah.

923
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
For the time, yeah.

924
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And that 3D platformer, it was kind of the closest thing PlayStation had to Mario 64, but it was different.

925
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I don't want to compare Spyro to Mario 64, but it was different.

926
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It was a good game.

927
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Yeah.

928
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It's one of those games now that a lot of PlayStation games, man, you go back to them and it's like,

929
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
yeah, this didn't hold up that well.

930
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's a pretty good game.

931
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
But do you think with the remaster and the graphics and everything, it'll hold up a lot better?

932
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Yeah, I think it'll hold up a lot better.

933
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I'm not buying it, but it'll hold up a lot better.

934
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I think I will.

935
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'll buy it.

936
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Why not?

937
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Is it coming out on PC, though?

938
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
They didn't say PC.

939
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
They didn't say PC, but it probably will.

940
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It's too bad.

941
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Did the Crash Collection come out on PC?

942
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I don't know if it ever did.

943
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
It might.

944
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
There's another series I haven't played.

945
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Really?

946
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You haven't played Crash Bandicoot either?

947
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I was never into it.

948
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I thought it looked ridiculous.

949
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And so the listeners might be thinking, watch this.

950
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
But you were very much a Sega girl, too, if these games weren't on Dreamcast.

951
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Really?

952
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Growing up, I had a Super Nintendo.

953
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
No, but this was after Super Nintendo.

954
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
This would have been like your college years.

955
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Well, no, I never had a PlayStation when they came out.

956
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I didn't have access to a PlayStation until I lived with Candace.

957
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And I only bought one game, and that was Final Fantasy VII.

958
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But you did have a Dreamcast right when it came out, right?

959
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Well, we had a Japanese Dreamcast, and then we had...

960
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And you had a 32X, right?

961
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Well, Dan did when I moved right here.

962
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
The only remaster collection I'm interested in right now is whenever they announce a Ridge

963
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Racer remaster collection.

964
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Give me a new R4.

965
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
New R4.

966
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I'm on board with that.

967
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
R4 had the best soundtrack.

968
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, JD suggests, hold out for Switch.

969
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You know, there's a lot of people that are asking, where's the Switch edition of this?

970
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's probably gonna...

971
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I think maybe they just didn't announce it, but it's...

972
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
You think it's...

973
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I think it's a guarantee.

974
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I think it's something it'll probably happen to.

975
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Okay, I have to say this now.

976
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
If anyone hears burping noises in the background, it's me.

977
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
It's you.

978
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's the cat.

979
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It's Mr. Smooshin.

980
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
No, it's because of my stupid digestion problems.

981
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So, I'm gonna burp, sorry.

982
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It's...

983
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Burp like a lady.

984
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Girl.

985
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So, whatever.

986
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Ridge Racer.

987
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Oh, that joke will never die.

988
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Let's see.

989
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Dartusia says, I thought I heard it got rated somewhere for a Switch version, but it wasn't

990
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
officially announced yet.

991
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yes, I do believe that was out there.

992
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Was it this week?

993
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I think it was...

994
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Was it the guy from...

995
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I'm trying to remember which company.

996
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
There was somebody.

997
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I remember, because now we're talking about Ridge Racer and stuff, and that made me think

998
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:08,000
of CEO Kazurai, and someone was actually following him and thought he was the actual CEO of Sony.

999
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And I never realized that that was a parody account or something.

1000
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Oh my god, that's funny.

1001
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It was funny.

1002
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I wanna say...

1003
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It took him this long to figure it out?

1004
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I don't remember.

1005
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I think it was someone at Take-Two or 2K or something like that.

1006
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I don't remember, but it was hilarious.

1007
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
That's pretty funny.

1008
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
At least they weren't DMing secrets or anything like that.

1009
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
That's good.

1010
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
All right.

1011
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Well, anyway, let's move on past Spyro.

1012
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1013
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Oh, those shenanigans.

1014
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Shenanigans.

1015
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So, we now have a new fighter entering this brawl over the net neutrality repeal, and

1016
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
that is the ESA.

1017
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So, they have jumped on in, and they are joining the lawsuit against the FCC over the repeal

1018
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
of net neutrality.

1019
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I need to write whoever wrote this fucking article that appeal and repeal are not the

1020
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
same fucking thing.

1021
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Just saying.

1022
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
But they applied to join in, and their whole thing on that...

1023
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And I'll just read the statement, going into the important part.

1024
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
In particular, broadband providers are now permitted to engage in practices that degrade

1025
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
consumers' traffic.

1026
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
That, in turn, could have significant consequences for the enjoyment of multiplayer online games

1027
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and cloud-based gameplay services, both of which require low-latency connections to support

1028
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
rapid and continuous interactivity.

1029
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And that's assuming that the intent is to throttle and have different paid tiers, which

1030
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
we haven't had anything lead to that yet.

1031
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But, I will say this, any industry left unregulated is going to take advantage of whatever they

1032
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
can to make the bottom line.

1033
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
We have seen this over and over in history.

1034
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Do not trust capitalist, you know, do not trust a capitalist society.

1035
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
They're going to fuck you for the money.

1036
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
That's just how it works.

1037
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Not that I want to say I'm for...

1038
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Not that I want to say I'm against net neutrality, because that's definitely not where my head

1039
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
is at.

1040
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
But this is more coming from my whole, my brain is preparing for the worst, that this

1041
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
is the reality that we're going to have to accept that they're going to get their way

1042
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
and that net neutrality is going to be gone.

1043
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Is it going to be as bad as people think it is?

1044
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Because there's a part of me that says that the consumers getting to regulate the market

1045
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
in some of the markets where there is competition, not here, unfortunately, we have one choice,

1046
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
that's it.

1047
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
But in some of the more competitive places, I would think that consumers aren't going

1048
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
to let these companies get away with charging $10 for a Netflix bundle and all this other

1049
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
shit.

1050
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I don't think it's going to get nickel to dime that way.

1051
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Except the thing is that the people who are part of the lawmaking process don't listen

1052
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
to their constituents.

1053
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
They listen to the money that goes into their pockets.

1054
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I know, I know.

1055
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But that's why I'm like, I'm just preparing for that this is going to be the way it is

1056
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
because...

1057
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm not looking, I'm not speculating anything about the future.

1058
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I'm looking at the past.

1059
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.

1060
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And we've seen what unregulated industry does.

1061
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
We've seen, I mean, again, I brought it up before, but the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory

1062
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Fire, where they locked women inside to make them work.

1063
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Child labor.

1064
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
An unregulated industry is going to do whatever it can to make the bottom line as cheap as

1065
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
possible.

1066
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Or like we should even remember, the same goddamn industry, not just several years,

1067
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
or a couple decades ago.

1068
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Remember Ma Bell?

1069
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Remember when they had to break up the Bell companies because it was just this giant fucking

1070
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
monopoly from phone service?

1071
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Yeah.

1072
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Remember that?

1073
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
How is Comcast not at that same point?

1074
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It's the same goddamn thing.

1075
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Comcast's acquisitions haven't been as big as the whole Spectrum Time Warner.

1076
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Comcast owns a fucking network.

1077
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
They own NBC.

1078
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
But the other ones you're looking at in terms of just internet?

1079
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
You've got that whole series of acquisitions done by AT&T.

1080
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Yeah.

1081
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You've got that whole series of acquisitions.

1082
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Now Time Warner and Spectrum have merged, and they bought Roadrunner, they bought all

1083
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
kinds of local ISPs.

1084
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Here's what's going to happen with the net neutrality thing.

1085
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And I'm building a little bit on what Bobby Blackwell said, so I want to give credit to

1086
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
him and his show because he talked a little bit about this.

1087
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I kind of think the data caps are going to be what comes into play with this, but in

1088
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
a little bit of a different way than what Bobby said.

1089
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Because as 4K gets more and more adopted, we're going to use more and more bandwidth.

1090
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Comcast, which is the big provider out there, upped all those bandwidth tiers to 1 terabyte,

1091
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
1,000 gigabytes.

1092
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
That's where we're at now.

1093
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Well, as 4K becomes more and more the standard, and as the internet gets faster and faster

1094
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
enough to deliver 4K on demand, which is where we're going to be in five years.

1095
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Well, yeah, and the internet has to get faster because my service speed hasn't gone up.

1096
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
But those data caps, they may not bulge.

1097
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
But here's where net neutrality and that whole thing, if it does not come back, here's where

1098
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
that whole thing is going to get you.

1099
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
This is what Comcast is going to do.

1100
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I don't think it's going to happen quite the same way that Bobby was saying on his show,

1101
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
but I think they will do.

1102
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:24,000
They're going to say, oh, but through Xfinity and our movies and our phone service and the

1103
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,000
things that are through Comcast, we're not going to put towards your data caps.

1104
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So if you use your 4K movies through Xfinity, what do they call the Comcast TV thing?

1105
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Is that what it is?

1106
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I don't know.

1107
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
X1 or whatever.

1108
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
X1.

1109
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
If you do it through that, it won't count towards the data cap because they kind of

1110
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
did that before.

1111
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
AT&T did that before.

1112
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I think T-Mobile does that right now or Verizon.

1113
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Somebody does that with theirs.

1114
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Oh, yeah.

1115
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
So that's, and that whole thing is that it's like, oh, if you stay in our ecosystem and

1116
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
you are buying your movies on demand through us and not through Apple TV or something like

1117
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
that, then it won't count towards data cap.

1118
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
But if you go out to Apple TV or you go out to Amazon Prime and you buy it there, oh,

1119
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
that's going to count towards data cap.

1120
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I don't think, because I don't think the market is going to let, I mean, I totally

1121
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
respect your perspective and everything.

1122
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And again, I want to reemphasize, I want net neutrality to come back.

1123
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I'm trying to deal with what is the future going to look like.

1124
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Well, even if it doesn't come back, I'm hopeful with this.

1125
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It seems like a lot of states are pushing for their own utilities for this stuff, which

1126
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
it really should be.

1127
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
You know something like that's going to pass here.

1128
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah, it really should be something that's like a utility that basically, you know, put

1129
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
it through the power system or something like that.

1130
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
You know, they have the whole new internet over power type stuff.

1131
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Azet in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, get rid of pie.

1132
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Yes, that smug motherfucker.

1133
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I fucking hate that guy.

1134
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,000
The one guy that won't fucking leave Washington.

1135
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Well, he's in trouble right now for the whole Sinclair stuff.

1136
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
That's a whole other ball of shit.

1137
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm just going to put it this way.

1138
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
We have elections this year.

1139
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
There's another series of elections, of course, in 2020.

1140
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And there are enough people who hate those motherfuckers right now that we're going to see a big change.

1141
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Make it happen, people.

1142
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You need to vote.

1143
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
If you live in this country, you need to vote.

1144
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I'm not going to tell you how to vote, but you need to, and not just vote for whoever has a cool name.

1145
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:41,000
You need to go vote for, although, like, you know, if somebody, you know, named like Rob Roberts was actually running for office, I probably would do that.

1146
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:49,000
But anyway, no, seriously, you need to do your research and know, like, what are these candidates and, you know, know where they stand and know that they are like four things you want.

1147
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Because when people don't vote, then people get a say that you may not want to have the say, but they have the say because they voted.

1148
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So the other the other thing, too, is, I mean, we definitely because I think this is a big part of it.

1149
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
That's the only reason I'm bringing it up. But we need to have caps on lobbying as well.

1150
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:21,000
You know, lobbying needs to be on equal terms without there being because that's how we get, you know, I would I would be what with 100 percent certainty.

1151
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:28,000
The whole reason that neutrality repealed is because the ISPs are paying lobbyists to make them think that this is right.

1152
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
They're getting a lot there. They're being legally bribed is what it is.

1153
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And in chat, there's talk about the whole Oprah for president.

1154
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
She won't do it. No, no more celebrities in government.

1155
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
No more like seriously. When was the last good celebrity in government?

1156
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
There was. OK, maybe Jesse Ventura.

1157
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Depending on where you are politically. I would even give and look, as as somebody who does lean left, I would not usually name Ronald Reagan, but I will give you that.

1158
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I realize a lot of fucked up the economy. I realize a lot of people are fans.

1159
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I will give you that. But that was in the 80s. Reagan fucked up our economy. Maybe Sonny Bono.

1160
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:16,000
OK, I was going to say and I can't. Al Franken. Well, until what happened is that he was completely terrible to women.

1161
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
But we need to just throw out the scope of terrible the women thing, though.

1162
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I mean, it's definitely. Well, whatever. There's a whole nother layer of the onion.

1163
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I don't think we should be peeling back right now. But the the the big thing is that fuck this drain the swamp bullshit.

1164
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,000
The swamp is in Washington. You need to throw out the garbage. He was just repeating stuff that he thought people would like to see.

1165
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Throw out the fucking garbage. Anyway, I totally appreciate that. J.D. in chat says, Rob, run in your local district.

1166
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I heart that you think that. And believe me, I've given it thought because and I've told the story on OLR before.

1167
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:03,000
But if you are not aware, my ex before I was with Alan, who if you go way, way, way back on this show, you can probably hear on this show at some point.

1168
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:11,000
What you may not have known at the time is that my ex was a candidate for state assembly here in California and he damn near won.

1169
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And we should all be thankful he didn't. In retrospect, I'm going to see this now.

1170
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:23,000
He didn't strike me as very smart. But the one thing I learned from that experience, I'm not going to sit here to shade my ex to know.

1171
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I'll shade him. We go for it. But the one thing not very smart.

1172
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:41,000
The one thing I learned from that whole experience, you guys, if this guy can run for office and get more votes than anyone in his party had ever gotten in that district, if that guy can run for office, any fucking idiot can run for office.

1173
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Just look at the president.

1174
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Three words that you wouldn't think go together. All two of them could go together. Gay, Asian, Republican.

1175
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I didn't want to talk about it. All right. Anyway, what else do I want to say about that whole thing? Before, not the ex.

1176
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Oh, me running for office and why that won't happen. Because, unfortunately, there is too much of my life that's been recorded.

1177
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Somebody will go back to early episodes of Orange Lounge Radio where we said stupid things because we weren't educated better.

1178
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Well, that's why we just have to erase it from the internet.

1179
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Somebody just put you doing Rocky.

1180
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Yeah, they'll take shit out of context. But the thing is, also with Rocky, I'm not embarrassed about any of that. Rocky gave an outlet to a lot of people, you know?

1181
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Yeah, but I mean, I'm just saying that it would be something that someone would try to use against you.

1182
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Somebody will find an early, early, early episode of this show or under station live or something where maybe I said the R word or I said granny chaser, but with a different word.

1183
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And now I know that that is not okay. Like, you know, I've been educated and that was a long time ago.

1184
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
But that's the disgustingness of politics is that people will dig up old shit.

1185
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:06,000
This is the reason why I like the activism that I do. Because the activism that I do, I can be as loud and fucking obnoxious as I need to be.

1186
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Although I try not to be loud and fucking obnoxious. I try to do things the right way. Activism is just as big a part as running for office.

1187
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Because you need to get out there and make your voice be heard by the masses.

1188
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And I don't care if people don't like, oh, this is not gaming. This is political. This all affects your life.

1189
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And as we can see now, it's going to affect your ability to game, you know, as what we see, you know, potentially happening with this whole net neutrality thing.

1190
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:48,000
It's going to be a thing. You've got to, I hate the term woke, but you've got to wake yourself up. You have to go out and be a part of life.

1191
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I do love these comments in chat. There's a great discussion going on in chat.

1192
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:59,000
J.D. says millennials will vote for a Rocky Horror person. That honestly is probably true. You know, that part honestly probably couldn't be held against me as much.

1193
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I would vote as long as you went into office in a corset.

1194
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Only with the theme playing. And let's see, Bobby Blackwell points out there was a guy running for office in Florida that got destroyed by the opposition because of the in-character post he made when he was in a vampire LARP.

1195
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:23,000
But see, I would look at somebody like that and go like, that person gets me in a way that, you know, curmudgeon-y frumple bump that's running against them doesn't.

1196
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I'm going to officially change my name to that.

1197
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I just found Loki's drag name.

1198
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It fits.

1199
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Rob's red now.

1200
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I just pulled that name out of thin air, but it works. It's a perfect drag name for Loki. Curmudgeon-y frumple bump. Is that what I said?

1201
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Curmudgeon-y frumple bump.

1202
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Anyway.

1203
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Rob.

1204
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I can't. I can't. Alright.

1205
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Rob had to lean against the wall.

1206
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I do want to say a Zets comment because it's really good. The thing is you have to own it. Hiding your skeletons is what gets you into trouble. Absolutely. Absolutely.

1207
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:16,000
And that's why I say right here, maybe I will run for office someday. If somebody tries to use that old shit against me, I learn every day and I learn to do better every day.

1208
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And so, yes, you will find stupid shit I said, but it was in 2004.

1209
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Raginator said Rob Robert's campaign slogan, in just seven days he'll make your district respectable.

1210
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I like that.

1211
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Wait, hold on. Hold on, you guys. Did Raginator actually say something funny?

1212
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Yes.

1213
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Could we get that in the OLR Wiki, please? It was Sunday, April 8th at 7.05 Pacific.

1214
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Get to it, dark, dark.

1215
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
It was Sunday, April 8th. Raginator said something funny. Actually funny. Give him a round of applause, everybody.

1216
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I'm such an asshole.

1217
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
S2100mattinchat says Rob owns all his skeletons.

1218
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
But Rob, are you a bleached asshole?

1219
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Stop it.

1220
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
S2100mattinchat says Rob owns his skeletons all the time. He says Super Metroid is the best game of all time over Chrono Trigger.

1221
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
You're right, I own it. I said what I said.

1222
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Everyone can be wrong.

1223
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
All right, anyway, let's move on.

1224
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Or as the phrase goes, even the clock is correct twice a day.

1225
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Loki, get us to another story.

1226
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Comradesome Frumblebump, get us to another story.

1227
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
All right, sounds good.

1228
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
So let's talk a little bit about PUBG.

1229
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:37,000
So PUBG and, of course, the company that makes it are going after some of these clones that are online.

1230
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:44,000
So one of these, I guess, PUBG Corp is citing, I guess, NetEase because they're using...

1231
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:52,000
It's not even necessarily that they're outright copying PUBG, like putting it up there, you know, just changing the name or something like that.

1232
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,000
But basically because they use the word chicken dinner in their marketing and they have their similarities in...

1233
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Are they gonna sue KFC?

1234
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:09,000
And they have similarities in... They have buildings and landscapes and vehicles and weapons and clothes and stuff like that.

1235
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And then also they were going after another company because they used a frying pan as a weapon in there.

1236
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Dude.

1237
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Wasn't a frying pan a weapon in Final Fantasy IV?

1238
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Well, a frying pan was a weapon in Left 4 Dead 2. I think one of the Silent Hill games had a frying pan as a weapon.

1239
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Frying pans have a history of being used as weapons.

1240
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Exactly. And should we go back to like...

1241
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Dragonlance books.

1242
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Like movies and stuff like that have used frying pans as weapons.

1243
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,000
So basically, I remember PUBG Corp was also one to like,

1244
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Why don't we share that Fortnite's doing better than our game?

1245
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
They're copiers.

1246
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Okay, Waluigi.

1247
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Seriously, they just bitch in moments.

1248
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
It seems like they don't have much of an argument.

1249
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,000
They need to get out of the mindset of a patent troll.

1250
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
They need to get out of the patent troll mindset.

1251
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Well, you can't trademark aspects of a game like this.

1252
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
You can't trademark frying pan.

1253
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
You can't trademark a frying pan because a frying pan is a fucking frying pan.

1254
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Our chat room is lighting up.

1255
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
JD says Princess Peach uses a frying pan as a weapon.

1256
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Sia Tabiri asks, are they going to sue Trixie Mattel?

1257
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Winner, winner. Chicken dinner.

1258
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
That phrase has been around for fucking ever.

1259
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I know it certainly is in Fortnite.

1260
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I remember reading the Dragonlance books ages ago,

1261
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
and one of the characters, her primary weapons were a pot lid and a frying pan.

1262
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, why not a steak dinner?

1263
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Steak dinner is better than chicken dinner.

1264
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I actually agree with Tigerclaw a lot on this.

1265
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Steak dinner is better than a chicken dinner.

1266
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Winner, winner. Ruth Chris gift card.

1267
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
That's the game I play.

1268
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
That doesn't rhyme.

1269
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Brad from Pop Culture says they're going to sue Cooking Mama.

1270
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
You guys are on fire with the jokes tonight. What's up with this?

1271
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
We've got some sassy bitches in the chat.

1272
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Y'all drank a load of sass before tonight's show.

1273
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You should think of new catchphrases they could use

1274
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
in place of winner, winner, chicken dinner.

1275
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Oh, maybe that should be a list list.

1276
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Oh, here I know. We could just say, I want my baby back, Rizzer.

1277
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Or, I feel like chicken tonight, or I don't know.

1278
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Loser, loser.

1279
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

1280
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Loser, loser. You starve.

1281
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
It was shake and bake, and I helped.

1282
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
It's stupid. It's dumb.

1283
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It screams of desperation because, I don't know,

1284
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,000
because they're blaming everybody but themselves for the game,

1285
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
not doing as well as their competition.

1286
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Honestly, their competition, they took the formula that they have,

1287
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
which is almost like a genre now,

1288
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
and just kind of made it different and better.

1289
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Sorry, you can cry about it all you want,

1290
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
but I don't think you have really the leg to stand on,

1291
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
the legal leg to stand on for suing these people,

1292
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
or trying to file a lawsuit against them.

1293
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Sorry.

1294
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Good luck with that.

1295
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I'm laughing because the chat room, Sia Tabiri goes,

1296
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
where's the beef?

1297
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:25,000
It's my favorite one so far for a replacement wine.

1298
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Pardon me, do you have any grape upon?

1299
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Jesus, you guys are on fire tonight.

1300
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
SSG100Matt says, you know what?

1301
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Competition keeps people from resting on their laurels.

1302
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
They should embrace it and keep one-upping each other with innovation.

1303
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
This.

1304
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Exactly.

1305
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
They put out some more maps for the game

1306
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
that just haven't really been released everywhere yet,

1307
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,000
so I know they've got some new maps that are supposed to get things more interesting,

1308
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,000
but yeah, you can't just, don't be like king, okay?

1309
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Don't be like king and start suing people for using the word candy or saga.

1310
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
It's ridiculous.

1311
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I can't believe nobody for a jingle for winning one of these one versus 100 games

1312
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
has said, a Mr. Bucket, a Mr. Bucket.

1313
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
All right, anyway.

1314
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Let's move on to another story that talks about,

1315
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
can you play PUBG on Linux?

1316
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Does that game exist on Linux?

1317
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
What about Fortnite?

1318
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Are these games on Linux?

1319
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I don't know because maybe.

1320
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I mean, they have the mobile versions run on Android and stuff,

1321
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
so maybe they have a Linux version.

1322
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
From Ragenator, Wiener Wiener, Oscar Mayer dinner.

1323
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
That's pretty good.

1324
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
That's pretty good.

1325
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Anyway, so here's the thing.

1326
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I want to talk a little bit about steam machines

1327
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
because if you weren't aware, steam machines kind of came and went.

1328
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Like, well, they're not gone, but.

1329
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
But they weren't popular?

1330
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Yeah, they just, they didn't really get adopted,

1331
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
and this was noted that, oh, Valve is no longer highlighting these steam machine hardwares

1332
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
on the front page of the Steam store,

1333
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
and this is saying, oh, this is the end.

1334
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
They're gone.

1335
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Although, Valve employee Pierre Lou Griffiths,

1336
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
because nobody has a title there,

1337
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
so I'm sorry if I butchered this guy's name,

1338
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
but he said in a post to a steam community that the steam machine link

1339
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
on the Steam store front page was removed based on user traffic.

1340
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
He did acknowledge, steam machines aren't exactly flying off the shelves,

1341
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
but our reasons for striving towards a competitive and open gaming platform

1342
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
haven't significantly changed.

1343
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Valve learned quite a bit about the state of the Linux ecosystem

1344
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
for real world game developers out there.

1345
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
We've taken a lot of feedback and have been heads down

1346
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
on addressing the shortcomings we've observed,

1347
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
and also went on to highlight that Valve is continuing to work

1348
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
on the Vulkan graphics standard.

1349
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
That does support Mac and Linux,

1350
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
and that's all in part to the company's effort.

1351
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
We have other Linux initiatives in the pipe

1352
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
that we're not quite ready to talk about.

1353
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
SteamOS will continue to be our medium to deliver these improvements to our customers,

1354
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
and we think they will ultimately benefit the Linux ecosystem at large.

1355
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
When are they going to put out a new source engine?

1356
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
When are they going to put out a game?

1357
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Anything.

1358
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Anything.

1359
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
What was the last game?

1360
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Dota 2.

1361
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Actually, probably VR games.

1362
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Now I think HTC Vive.

1363
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Didn't they have a card game or something?

1364
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Dota had a card game, yes.

1365
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Yeah, the Dota card game.

1366
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
But I think to be fair, some of the HTC Vive experiences

1367
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
were where some of the resources was going lately.

1368
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:18,000
So I just, like many of you, would just like to see Valve do literally anything.

1369
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I just miss the old Valve, where they put out games.

1370
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Yes.

1371
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Semi-regularly.

1372
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Bobby Blackwell, I knew he would be on top of his VR stuff.

1373
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Bobby Blackwell says the Lab was the last Valve game.

1374
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
That was more of a minigame.

1375
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Maybe a couple years ago.

1376
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,000
In gaming terms, it was ages ago, yes.

1377
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
So, Steam Machines didn't quite take off.

1378
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Does this surprise you guys, or no?

1379
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Why?

1380
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
No, it doesn't surprise me, because small form factor PCs,

1381
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
they're just hard to, it's hard to make a really small form factor.

1382
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
And honestly, I think if you're going to game on a TV or something like that,

1383
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
it doesn't have to be that small of a case, just make it look nice.

1384
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I mean, that's really it.

1385
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
They have cases that are fucking huge, but it's all about thermals and shit.

1386
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And also something like that, you want to be able to make sure that it's upgradeable,

1387
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
because it is a PC after all.

1388
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It was hard, I think what it was is they were trying to compete with consoles.

1389
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And the cost of consoles is so low now, it's hard to make a PC that, you know,

1390
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
is going to be competitive price-wise.

1391
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
DarkSagro, do you have an opinion on the Steam Boxes or Steam Machines

1392
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
and why they didn't do so well?

1393
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Not really.

1394
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I mean, people, if they want a console, they'll get a console.

1395
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
You know, I just...

1396
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at with this too.

1397
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I don't think Valve ever really said, not that it's said,

1398
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
but I don't think Valve found the audience for this.

1399
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Like, Valve never really figured out who's the audience for these boxes,

1400
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
because I feel like most people that want to do PC gaming have a PC.

1401
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Most people that want to play on their TV have a console.

1402
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
So where does this fit in? Is it supposed to compete with consoles?

1403
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Well, I would assume Microsoft and a lot of stuff that they're doing

1404
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
kind of cock-blocked them in that regard,

1405
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
because Microsoft's kind of been pushing with their console and the PC space

1406
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
and trying to unify that, and I think this is a case where maybe

1407
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Microsoft kind of has pulled that off a little better than Steam.

1408
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I was only using my Steam Link.

1409
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Yeah, I have a Steam Link and I haven't used it yet.

1410
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I mean, we used our old one once and then returned it,

1411
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
and I actually needed to ask you how you had your setup

1412
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
that you don't get any latency, so...

1413
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Because it's wired. I use that gigantic wire and I plug it into the Steam Link.

1414
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
That's how I don't get latency.

1415
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Okay.

1416
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Yep.

1417
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

1418
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, battery.

1419
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Bobby Blackwell says,

1420
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Steam Link is better for playing PC games on a TV

1421
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
than getting a Steam machine, or rather, cheaper.

1422
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And yeah, they are, man, I paid like 50 bucks for one,

1423
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
and Fantaz says, I bought a Steam Link for four bucks on Black Friday.

1424
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Got it for a dollar.

1425
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Yeah, that's how I got mine.

1426
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
A lot of them, they're giving them away with different game purchases,

1427
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
so keep an eye out for those wonderful sales.

1428
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Man, that makes me mad. Alright, let's move on.

1429
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Another subject, Dark Sakura.

1430
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Well, there are games that are now, again, banned in China,

1431
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
but they're taking it a step further.

1432
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:27,000
So basically, what happened is that there was a scene in,

1433
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I think it was Call of Duty Black Ops 2,

1434
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
where you could drop a bomb in Tiananmen Square,

1435
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,000
and so the Chinese government pretty much, you know,

1436
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:43,000
did this big crackdown so that they would, I guess, ban the game again,

1437
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
but they're also now putting in surveillance in Internet cafes

1438
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
to keep people from buying them and from playing the games.

1439
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
They're actually trying to stop all playing of banned games.

1440
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Some of the other ones were Red Alert 2,

1441
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Glory of the Republic, where you could fight against the People's Liberation Army.

1442
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,000
There's just a big list of games, but there's more than 5,000 Internet cafes

1443
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
now have to have a government surveillance system on all the computers.

1444
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So one of the players is saying is that every time they play,

1445
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
there's this message that pops up to warn them

1446
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
and that it's really just removed a lot of the fun from playing, of course.

1447
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
But anyway, the way it's going to work is that any official will be notified

1448
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
if users are playing banned games in the cafes.

1449
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I guess there could always be worse laws than leaving net neutrality behind,

1450
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
but I'm kind of not surprised to hear that particular topic,

1451
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
the Tiananmen Square thing, is a very sensitive thing to the Chinese government

1452
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:56,000
for obvious reasons, things that they're not exactly wanting their people to really know about.

1453
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
We're heading that way, though.

1454
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Well, we need to embrace and remember that in this country.

1455
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
We're able to share these types of things openly, at least the way things are now.

1456
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I don't really think some of those fundamental American things are really ever going to go away,

1457
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
but that we're able to have that freedom of speech to be able to talk about it.

1458
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
To have this fucking show, honestly, and say whatever we want,

1459
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
we have to be thankful that we have that ability because not everybody in the world does.

1460
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:30,000
As pissed off as we get sometimes, the way things are, there are some pretty rad things about being an American.

1461
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
And the right to get pissed off about it is one of them.

1462
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Anyway, let's move on. Loki, just a couple more stories before we get to the Classic Game of the Week.

1463
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:45,000
This is kind of cool news. There was an announcement about Jackbox Party Pack 5,

1464
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
and one of the games that's going to be among that is You Don't Know Jack.

1465
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:56,000
They have this fictional company, I guess, that's kind of like the overlay for the whole thing,

1466
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
this binge pipe or something like that, and it's this kind of...

1467
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Buzzfeed type of thing.

1468
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Yeah, a parody of all the streaming services out there and content and social media and stuff like that.

1469
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
So it's interesting. I don't know what other games are supposed to be in there as well.

1470
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
They haven't announced those yet. They'll trickle that out over the coming months.

1471
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
But that sounds cool that there's going to be a whole new You Don't Know Jack games.

1472
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Yeah, I forgot to mention in my gaming league. That was the game I was trying to think of that I forgot.

1473
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:32,000
But on Friday, I actually did a Jackbox stream. I guessed it on CI Live's Con Improv, which our old friend of the show,

1474
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
he used to go by DMN. He doesn't go by that anymore, but that's what he was back in the day.

1475
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:41,000
But Jon works a lot with this group, the Con Improv group, and so they had me on their stream on Friday night doing

1476
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Sorry, not You Don't Know Jack, but the Jackbox Party Pack.

1477
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,000
And that was fun because somehow some of those games I just had never gotten around to playing.

1478
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Although I have all the Jackbox Party Packs, I guess I just never really had the people to play some of them.

1479
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
So we played that bracketeering, and we actually had 16 people in the game, and that was a lot of fun.

1480
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And I actually won one of them.

1481
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
The bracket was, because it just keeps going like these against these against these.

1482
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
You just keep kind of voting on answers.

1483
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:14,000
And the bracket was Best Name for a CPR Dummy, and I said Dummy McDummy Face, and I won.

1484
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
So there you go. But anyway.

1485
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
So yeah, the Jackbox games are fun.

1486
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
And they've always been, they've come on the show a couple times here at ORR.

1487
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I think we know people over there that actually listen to the show.

1488
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
So hi guys, and good luck with You Don't Know Jack and Jackbox Party Pack 5.

1489
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I'm sure tons of people are gonna buy it because these games are great party games.

1490
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
They're great, like, you know, let's come together and do this.

1491
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:43,000
One thing I do want to call out though, you know, in the interest of fairness, even though I'm big fans of Jackbox.

1492
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:48,000
They have made this whole, like, You Don't Know Jack is going to use mobile phones.

1493
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
And they've really stood by that.

1494
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Because one place where the last version of You Don't Know Jack, I think in the first Party Pack, if I remember right, first or second, I think the first one.

1495
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Where that one got a little bit of, you know, kind of criticism was that because people were using their phones to buzz in,

1496
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
it wasn't exactly accurate.

1497
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
And you couldn't really use a controller, like you couldn't plug in a bunch of controllers and have people buzz in on the controller.

1498
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Like when You Don't Know Jack was, you know, on the PC and stuff where you had something more tangible and wired to buzz in on.

1499
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
And so I thought it was interesting in some of the, you know, FAQs on this.

1500
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
They basically said, yeah, we've heard that feedback and we're basically not going to implement it.

1501
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:34,000
But to be fair to them, they have said that they are building this one with the mobile phone stuff in mind.

1502
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
So this is being built for the mobile phones.

1503
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:44,000
So I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt because, you know, especially I kind of thought we weren't going to see You Don't Know Jack again.

1504
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Because I kind of thought Trivia Murder Party was their new, like, You Don't Know Jack.

1505
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And that game does work very well.

1506
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It is pretty awesome.

1507
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
And that game was built for mobile phones from the ground up.

1508
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:59,000
So with that in mind, knowing that Trivia Murder Party worked out really well.

1509
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:05,000
That's why I'm kind of having an open mind with letting them do You Don't Know Jack again even though they're not going to go back to a tangible controller for it.

1510
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
So we'll see what happens. I'm very curious.

1511
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
So let's see.

1512
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Bobby said, oh, it was in the VOG Network review because he wrote it because he didn't have them on his show.

1513
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:25,000
And said, you need a controller support, but then agrees that my friends only want to play Trivia Murder Party.

1514
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Well, too bad they couldn't, like, come up with a better way to, like, basically capture when someone buzzes in, like, you know, grabbing.

1515
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I know it's hard to grab server time sometimes, but maybe just grabbing the server time every so often and then calculating it also with your phone time.

1516
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Right.

1517
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,000
So you kind of get a timestamp and then that way any latency that's in there, just reading timestamps.

1518
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So that way you shouldn't latency shouldn't be a problem. It's just me taking a sec for it to clue that you're, you know, say that you buzzed in.

1519
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I honestly wonder if in the new You Don't Know Jack game, they're just going to get rid of buzzing in because that's what they did in Trivia Murder Party.

1520
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
You don't buzz in. Everybody answers the question.

1521
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And those who get it wrong basically, you know, go to the death game or whatever, that whole thing.

1522
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Right.

1523
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:16,000
So, I mean, what if that's their solution is that the new You Don't Know Jack game, they're just going to get rid of buzzing in.

1524
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,000
It'll be interesting, but again, because I like Trivia Murder Party so much and the other Jackbox games, too.

1525
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I know I keep talking about that one, but that one's the most adjacent to You Don't Know Jack and what it does.

1526
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I think the new You Don't Know Jack will turn out just fine.

1527
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
So we'll see.

1528
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Good luck to those guys.

1529
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Look forward to it.

1530
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
And hey, if you want to come on to OLR and talk about it, maybe drop an exclusive or two.

1531
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Love to have you.

1532
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
All right, one more story before we get to the classic game of the week.

1533
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And this has to do with, this is really cool.

1534
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Actually, this is a classic all in its own.

1535
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
And a lot of the games that will be included in this could very well be classic games of the week.

1536
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:57,000
SNK has revealed at PAX East in a panel that they are releasing a 40th anniversary collection for the Nintendo Switch.

1537
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
And this is going to include games that are upscaled to 1080p.

1538
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Now, even though this is SNK, this is not Neo Geo stuff.

1539
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
This is stuff that they made before Neo Geo was a thing.

1540
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,000
So this compilation includes games that will be released on the Nintendo Switch in Fall 2018.

1541
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
It includes things like Athena, both arcade and home versions.

1542
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Alpha Mission, home and arcade versions.

1543
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Akari Warriors.

1544
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Fuck yes.

1545
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Akari Warriors 3.

1546
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
What was the name of the second Akari Warriors game?

1547
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
It's in there too.

1548
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Gorilla War, P.O.W., Psycho Soldier, Street Smart, T.N.K.3, Vanguard.

1549
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Oh, Victory Road. That was Akari Warriors 2.

1550
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Psycho Soldier and, last but not least, Crystallis.

1551
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Which is an amazing NES RPG.

1552
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I can't believe there was never a second one.

1553
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Or was there? Am I missing something in our soccer?

1554
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Did they try to do like a second Crystallis on Neo Geo or something?

1555
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I don't remember.

1556
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
I don't think they did. I think Crystallis...

1557
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I know there was a Game Boy release at some point, but that was just the original game.

1558
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
So I think, yeah, they just didn't ever visit that series again.

1559
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Oh yeah, Crystallis was remade for Game Boy Color with a bonus boss. That was it.

1560
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I do remember that.

1561
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Anyway, with this collection, there will be a limited edition version of this with a book and a soundtrack CD.

1562
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
So that's all coming out Fall 2018.

1563
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
That's awesome. I'm definitely going to pick that up.

1564
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Shit, for Crystallis alone, probably.

1565
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
But all those other games are really good too.

1566
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I actually, I remember playing Athena on the NES and I didn't hate it as much as everyone else did.

1567
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Although it was a little bit wonky.

1568
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
But Ikaria Warriors, all those games are great.

1569
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
This does beg the question though.

1570
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Why wouldn't they just release these on Virtual Console?

1571
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Now, yes, I know, LOL, Nintendo Virtual Console.

1572
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
But surely, they would have just kept these in the hopper to release.

1573
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Like Crystallis, they would have just released on Virtual Console at some point, right?

1574
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Or what's going on there?

1575
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
We won't know until September.

1576
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I suppose.

1577
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
If it ends up being September.

1578
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I did notice though, like I bought, because I mentioned one of my friends, their daughter had a birthday.

1579
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
So I don't know how to shop for girls.

1580
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
So I know they had a Nintendo Switch, so I bought her a Switch game.

1581
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Bought her Scribblenauts, the new one.

1582
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I don't remember what it is.

1583
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Some party game, Scribblenauts party game.

1584
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Anyways, but it did mention something on the back.

1585
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
That there may be a fee for online service or something like that.

1586
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
So they have that already in play.

1587
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
That they're going to charge something for it later on.

1588
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Just when that later on is going to be.

1589
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Alright, well, maybe finally we'll have some Virtual Console answers at E3 this year.

1590
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
But I'm really at the point where I'm like, I'm just not going to hold my breath anymore.

1591
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
It'll happen when it happens.

1592
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Maybe never.

1593
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
It's disappointing. I think it's money left on the table for them.

1594
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I do too, but it's their choice.

1595
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Because they seem to be making a lot of money anyway.

1596
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Anyway, let's take a trip down memory lane.

1597
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Every week Dark Sakura opens the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

1598
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Hey, you brats, you should be paying attention to this.

1599
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
But, in a twist for the year 2018, once a month she says,

1600
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Hey, why don't you use this peripheral to play a game?

1601
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
It's Dark Sakura's classic peripheral of the month.

1602
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Or, what?

1603
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Say it with me. Peripheral.

1604
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Peripheral. I just...

1605
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
It's your piscetti.

1606
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
You learn to say things one way and it's tomato, tomato, it's ingrained in your brain.

1607
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Anyway, or as my dad always said, ammons.

1608
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
And that's the one that messes with me.

1609
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Ew.

1610
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Yeah, I know, right? Anyway.

1611
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
But in this case it's peripherals of the month.

1612
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Yes, well, because they're technically the same thing.

1613
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Alright, so here it is.

1614
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
For the same reason.

1615
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
What did you pick, Dark Sakura?

1616
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I picked the twin sticks.

1617
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Specifically starting with the Saturn twin stick and then the Dreamcast twin stick.

1618
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Which were both released simply for one game each.

1619
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:56,000
The Saturn twin stick was a peripheral designed to be used on Cybertroopers Virtual On.

1620
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:03,000
So it is two joysticks that have fewer buttons but each of them have a button on top.

1621
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:11,000
And it's set up, at least the Saturn twin stick is meant to look like the same style as a Virtual On panel.

1622
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:16,000
It was only sold with the pack that contained Virtual On.

1623
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Although the twin sticks did have it's own product code.

1624
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:29,000
It was released only in Japan even though there was an English and European manual.

1625
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,000
And it led to then the creation of the Dreamcast twin stick.

1626
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,000
In Japan it was released on November 29th, 1996.

1627
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:45,000
And retailed for 5,800 yen, so roughly 50 something bucks.

1628
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I sadly do not have a whole lot about the specifics of this.

1629
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
But I can tell you that they're fucking fun to play with.

1630
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Now this goes on, I'm actually to this day still wanting a pair of Saturn twin sticks.

1631
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
But now I'll go to something that I do own, the Dreamcast twin stick.

1632
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Which was released to be used with Cybertroopers Virtual On or Atario Tangrum.

1633
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:17,000
And it is exactly just like the Saturn twin stick except it's that plain grey and white Dreamcast with orange buttons on it.

1634
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
It does have a VMU slot and it only released in Japan.

1635
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
It's release date was December 9th, 1999.

1636
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:32,000
And it also, even though it came out years later, it also retailed for the same price, 5,800 yen.

1637
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
You can play Virtual On with a controller.

1638
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:46,000
But there's just something different about playing it with the twin sticks that make the game so much more immersive and so much more fun to play.

1639
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
And we had a lot of time spent on Atario Tangrum.

1640
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Rob, do you remember Game Masters that used to be on Greenback?

1641
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1642
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
That's where we got our twin sticks from.

1643
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Oh, funny.

1644
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
That's where we got our Japanese Dreamcast.

1645
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,000
So, we just had so much fun with Virtual On and I love fucking Virtual On.

1646
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Which I've done for Classic Game before.

1647
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
You can't mention Virtual On without eventually bringing up the twin sticks.

1648
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,000
So, I've never played on any game other than Virtual On.

1649
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
So, I do not know if it's compatible.

1650
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,000
But, hey, it's fucking fun and it's my peripheral of the week.

1651
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Alright, there you go.

1652
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
The twin sticks.

1653
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Twins, because there's two of them.

1654
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
And plus, that music in the background is the best music in Virtual On.

1655
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
It was really just an excuse for you to play Virtual On music here on the show, wasn't it?

1656
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Kind of, sort of.

1657
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
That's alright, I totally support that.

1658
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Anyway, we are going to take a quick break.

1659
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1660
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Including your calls, Orange Lounge Radio.

1661
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
All one word on Skype if you want to give us a call a little later.

1662
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
And we're going to get as well some rapid fire news and some more stories.

1663
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Sadly, no mailbag tonight it looks like though.

1664
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
At least when I looked before the show there wasn't anything there.

1665
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
So, I don't know.

1666
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I haven't checked yet.

1667
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Yeah, but just don't forget to send us emails in the future.

1668
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1669
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
So, we've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come when we come back.

1670
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1671
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
We're back live tonight with episode number 725 of our show, already in progress.

1672
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,000
And thank you guys, of course, as always for tuning in and spending your Sunday nights with us.

1673
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Or, whatever time throughout the week you're setting aside to listen to this podcast.

1674
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
We do really appreciate it, of course.

1675
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Before we get into some rapid fire news tonight, I have some late breaking news.

1676
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:43,000
And, unfortunately, this is another one of those, like, Lord Face Palm type of stories.

1677
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Overwatch League just suspended another player.

1678
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:53,000
This time the Boston Uprising has suspended Dream Casper, was the name of the guy, following.

1679
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:02,000
He's 21 and this follows allegations he pursued a romantic and potentially sexual relationship with someone believed to be a 14 or 15 year old girl.

1680
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
In a tweet, the Boston Uprising said,

1681
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:13,000
We take all allegations of this nature very seriously and as a result, Dream Casper has been suspended from the Boston Uprising indefinitely.

1682
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,000
The Overwatch League also putting out a tweet that they are aware of the situation as well.

1683
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Dream Casper, one of the best Western DPS players in the league, who was unknown prior to the league debut and will no doubt slip right back into obscurity after this.

1684
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:34,000
That, by the way, for those keeping score at home, is the sixth player suspended by the Overwatch League for some sort of shitty behavior since it's begun.

1685
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Look, I've talked a lot at length about the Overwatch League here on the program.

1686
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I like that at least little baby steps, you know, they finally got a woman on the league, which is one.

1687
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
We got a token, but we can do a little bit better in that regard.

1688
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:55,000
And I think, you know, as we're starting to see the Overwatch League really kind of push esports to the next level.

1689
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Like, you know, ESPN ran this story I just read to you guys.

1690
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
So, you know, esports is becoming more and more mainstream.

1691
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I just, I have a feeling, you know, I'm not going to try to blame Overwatch League for the shitty behavior.

1692
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:13,000
You know, shitty people are going to do shitty things and I'm not sure Overwatch League, I'm not sure what they could have done to prevent it.

1693
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,000
It's just, you know, their response is swift and mighty and that's what they have to do.

1694
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,000
But my whole thing is just like, we're going to really see, you know, as the spotlight gets put on some of these people,

1695
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:29,000
we're going to really see some behaviors just kind of like, you know, I guess it's like Jamie has said before, taking out the trash.

1696
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
And unfortunately Overwatch League's had a little bit of it.

1697
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:43,000
But hopefully they will, hopefully they will just do better in some of their recruitment so far for Season 2.

1698
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Alan Alchemy in chat, in all caps, mind you, says,

1699
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:55,000
These dudes get paid thousands between Patreons, Twitch partnerships, and gaming equipment sponsorships to play video games.

1700
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Literally all that is asked of them is to not be racist, homophobic, or date rape, and they can't do it.

1701
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,000
JD in chat says, Here's the thing, a lot of professional athletes have a problem being decent people.

1702
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Whatever, congratulations gaming, you've arrived. Your athletes are just as overpaid to be awful people as mainstream culture.

1703
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Azet in chat says, But I'm famous and popular and can do anything. What are consequences?

1704
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:29,000
So that's why I said, you know, I will give Overwatch League credit for bringing down the Swift hammer of justice swiftly.

1705
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Anyhow, let's move on to something a little more positive and some rapid fire news and some things to look forward to in gaming. Loki.

1706
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Alright, so Chrono Trigger, we talked about the PC port, that was kind of meh, not great.

1707
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:55,000
People didn't like what they kind of did to the graphics of the game. However, with that, they've been, apparently Square Enix has been working to address issues.

1708
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And one of the patches that they will be releasing will be a patch that includes the original graphics for the game.

1709
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:09,000
So at least that's something. No word on when that is exactly going to, you know, make it there.

1710
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
So you can turn the filter on and off.

1711
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Yes.

1712
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Or what they're doing is they're quickly making another, but they're not going to tell you it's another filter, it's just the regular graphics.

1713
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Probably.

1714
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Yeah. Anyway.

1715
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:28,000
So. And then this was something that I saw kind of in my feeds because I do follow Angry Joe a bit.

1716
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:40,000
But if you're not aware, he worked on this along with some other people to do a Street Fighter tabletop strategy game, it looks like.

1717
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And so basically it's got a miniatures game, I guess would be the best way to describe it.

1718
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:49,000
So it's a Street Fighter miniatures game and the miniatures look pretty fucking awesome.

1719
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
It was on Kickstarter, got funded in a day.

1720
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,000
But if you are interested in it, you can check it out on Kickstarter.

1721
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
So just look for Street Fighter, the miniatures game.

1722
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
And yeah, it's pretty awesome looking.

1723
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I mean, just these would totally be awesome amiibos.

1724
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I mean, I don't know.

1725
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I'm not really interested in a ton of miniatures games.

1726
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
It's been a while since I was in the miniatures scene, but it looks cool.

1727
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Fantasmchat says Angry Joe was at PAX, which doesn't surprise me.

1728
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
PAX is a pretty strong board game community.

1729
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Didn't they do the PAX Unplugged? Didn't that happen this year in Pennsylvania somewhere?

1730
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
I don't remember.

1731
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Philly or something. Anyway.

1732
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I remember being a kid though and having like the Street Fighter RPG game that I think was done by White Wolf.

1733
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Yes, funny enough, Bobby Black Wolf. I was just about to read that. You're right.

1734
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
There was a pen and paper Street Fighter game in the 90s.

1735
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
It was by the same people who made Vampire, Werewolf, and Mage games.

1736
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I interviewed the dude who designed it, so you can see that on a previous episode.

1737
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I didn't even look in the chat, but I had it.

1738
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Yeah, I remember that too actually.

1739
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Some of the cool stuff they have in there.

1740
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
So they have like destructible environment pieces and stuff.

1741
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,000
And each of the play mats or whatever you can do like different stages from the games.

1742
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
So they have like Guile's stage and I know they have like the dojo and stuff.

1743
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Hopefully you can play music.

1744
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
But can you say, oh my car?

1745
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I don't know.

1746
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,000
But yeah, with the game I know that they have like six core miniatures that come with it.

1747
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,000
So Ryuken, Chun-Li, Zangief, Vega, and Sagat.

1748
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
And then they're going to have an expansion with Bison and Akuma.

1749
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:31,000
And then I know some of the stretch goals were different characters from other games.

1750
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
So like the Alpha series and that kind of stuff.

1751
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
So yeah, I mean, it looks cool.

1752
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
It looks pretty high quality. Hope it works out and gets released.

1753
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
So Kickstarter is always very wary.

1754
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I understand.

1755
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Alright, well let's talk about original Xbox.

1756
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Not the 360, not the Xbox One, but I mean like the Xbox First.

1757
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Direct Xbox, going way back.

1758
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Some news for the original Xbox.

1759
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Targeted to come out April 10th at 3.30 Pacific, 6.30 Eastern.

1760
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
So maybe by the time some of you have heard this.

1761
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:12,000
And it's going to be a backwards compatibility for these games on the Xbox One.

1762
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Now there already has been a little bit.

1763
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
But we're going to hear about the next wave of this on the next Inside Xbox.

1764
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Because right now there's only 13 games that are supported by the service.

1765
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
So Microsoft said in a recent Xbox news post,

1766
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,000
one of our most common requests is for original Xbox backward compatibility news.

1767
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,000
And we'll be starting off the show with a big update on just that.

1768
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
What? People want backwards compatibility?

1769
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
That's totally news to Sony.

1770
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Make sure more people watch that than have watched anything before.

1771
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Because that's apparently the only way that Sony is going to get some of the information.

1772
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I've lost hope in Sony, let's be honest.

1773
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Yeah. Anyway, shoot, this next website is not loading for me.

1774
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I don't know if this is something that you can pull up.

1775
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Oh my god, the backwards compatibility is not working on the website.

1776
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,000
I know. Gosh. But anyway, I do remember it was something to do with the SNK heroines.

1777
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:07,000
The tag team frenzy is coming out on the Switch on September 7th in North America and Europe.

1778
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
And I thought this was cool. They're adding Shermie as a character in the game.

1779
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
And it made me think of Dark Sakura's former kitty.

1780
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Is that where the name came from?

1781
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
That is indeed where my cat's name came from.

1782
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
When I saw that I instantly thought of you.

1783
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
It did work on mine because my PC is beyond Windows XP.

1784
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
It's not on Windows XP.

1785
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:31,000
It is coming out digitally on PlayStation 4 September 7th in Europe as well.

1786
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
In North America and Europe.

1787
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
And they're going to have Shermie as a playable character.

1788
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
And she debuted in Kingdom Fighters 97.

1789
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
And it looks neat.

1790
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Alright, thank you for the pinch hitting there with the correction on the platforms it's coming out for.

1791
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1792
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Well, Konami has purchased a domain name recently for Goemon.

1793
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
So Goemon.com has been purchased.

1794
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,000
They haven't done anything with it yet.

1795
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:08,000
But maybe there will be a new Goemon game on Switch? Maybe? We'll see.

1796
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Well, the Bomberman revitalization did very well for them.

1797
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:19,000
So, you know, Goemon. I don't think it's a game people know as well here on this side of the ocean.

1798
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I don't know. I used to play tons of Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

1799
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Yeah, Legend of the Mystical Ninja was badass though.

1800
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
That's one of those, like, if you haven't played this Super Nintendo game, you should check that one out.

1801
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Because it used a lot of the Mode 7 tricks and some of the retro shit.

1802
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Like, you can play the first stage of Gradius in that game. Which is cool.

1803
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:47,000
And then in other news, there have been some other speedruns announced for Summer Games Done Quick 2018.

1804
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Including Cuphead, Metroid Samus Returns, Super Mario Odyssey.

1805
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
And it's going to be happening on June 24th through July 1st.

1806
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,000
And hopefully, well, I'll get a chance to watch it.

1807
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:08,000
One of them actually I'm interested in is a Final Fantasy 6 speedrun that's glitchless.

1808
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Yeah, it was all espers too. That looked cool.

1809
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Ooh, that would be cool.

1810
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:19,000
I was going to say, the first thing I did when I heard that they announced their lineup, immediately looked for P.T.

1811
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Very disappointing.

1812
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
To see if it was there and why is the clock over there.

1813
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Because they'd have to know the triggers.

1814
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I know, I know.

1815
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,000
But other games listed are A Hat in Time, Celeste, which I almost picked up.

1816
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Divinity Original Sin 2, Eichen Class, and a good bunch of others.

1817
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Though, I don't know, they always need to end with Super Metroid and last year's didn't.

1818
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Are they going to end with it this year?

1819
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I don't think so.

1820
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Wow.

1821
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:53,000
But they also have a good backup list, I guess, for if they get extra time or make tiers or whatnot.

1822
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I always like races. Whenever they do races, it's awesome.

1823
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Yeah, the Super Metroid race was really fun.

1824
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Yeah.

1825
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Like two people just like died right away.

1826
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
How about a P.T. race? I'd be in for that.

1827
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Alright.

1828
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
You'd have to know your triggers.

1829
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Or the swordless, I like the swordless randomized items, Legends, all the...

1830
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Those are fun.

1831
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Those are great, yeah.

1832
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out what speed games might be ran this week.

1833
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
New in retail and digitally.

1834
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
There's actually some things coming out this week, so that's kind of nice.

1835
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
We have a game called Dark Rose Valkyrie on PC.

1836
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
A game called Extinction on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

1837
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Owlboy is making its console debut on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1838
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:48,000
A game called Project Nimbus Code Marae on PlayStation 4.

1839
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:54,000
We have a game called Regalia of Men and Monarchs, Rail Edition on PlayStation 4.

1840
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice on Xbox One.

1841
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Maelstrom on PC.

1842
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Robocraft Infinity on Xbox One.

1843
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Ys Origins on Xbox One.

1844
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Then we've got Death and Request on PlayStation 4.

1845
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Also coming out a little bit later in the week,

1846
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Regalia of Men and Monarchs, Royal Edition on the Switch and Xbox One.

1847
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
And then, that's it.

1848
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Okay, let's travel over to Japan, where that same Death and Request game comes out in a regular and Death and box in Japan on April the 12th.

1849
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Cities Skylines gets its PlayStation 4 edition in Japan also on the 12th.

1850
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:45,000
And a new release of Darkest Dungeon with Chinese subs comes out for the greater Asian region also on April the 12th.

1851
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Checking the Vita, believe it or not, nothing this week, because the Vita is still supported in Japan.

1852
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
They have a release next week on the 19th, just not this week.

1853
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Then looking quickly at the Switch and the DS.

1854
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Looks like The Snack World trays Jarere's Gold.

1855
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I don't know if I'm saying that right, but that's a level 5 game.

1856
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
So, I mean, there's got to be something to that.

1857
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Maybe that's something that will come out over here eventually.

1858
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I don't know, but Snack World, maybe that's going to be their next Yokai watch, who knows.

1859
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
But that is going to be out on the Switch, so that will probably be a pretty big release being that that's a level 5 game.

1860
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,000
3DS doesn't really have anything this week, so otherwise it is pretty quiet over in Japan.

1861
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
How about Europe, DarkSakura?

1862
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:33,000
A few things. We have, let's see, on the 10th we have Extinction on PlayStation and Xbox, the new ones.

1863
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Darkest Dungeon Crimson Edition for Switch.

1864
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Steam World Dig 2 for Switch, that's on April 12th.

1865
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:46,000
On April 13th we have Rick and Morty Virtual Rick-ality, and that's it.

1866
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Alright.

1867
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:53,000
So, this, maybe because I was looking ahead in the month, in a couple weeks from now, of course, we have the Nintendo Labo stuff.

1868
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Let's see someone speedrun that, and that includes building the peripherals that they need to do the game.

1869
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,000
That would actually be a really funny speedrun to submit, a Nintendo Labo building.

1870
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
You have to build it and then play it.

1871
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
That sounds like something out of Odyssey of the Mind.

1872
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Nintendo Labo Robot Kit, I want to see the speedrun of that, including building the whole robot armor that you have to wear.

1873
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Alright, usually this part of the show we would do the mailbag.

1874
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
What mailbag?

1875
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:25,000
The one that we have that's always open 24-7. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1876
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,000
But DarkSakura opened it, and there was nothing there.

1877
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
There were some moths.

1878
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
The moths ate all the mail.

1879
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
That's right, the moths ate all the mail, so there it is.

1880
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
And then the dust bunnies ate the moths.

1881
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Alright, we didn't have anything that we didn't read.

1882
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I thought we had something we didn't read on the other show.

1883
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I hope we didn't miss something.

1884
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
If we did, I'm sorry, re-forward it. We'll get to it next week.

1885
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
But participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1886
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
So then we'll get back into some news. Loki.

1887
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Alright, so apparently there's this study that is done with Take Two games.

1888
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Rockstar North, I should say.

1889
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:07,000
There's been quite a pay inequality issue with genders at the company.

1890
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:15,000
So they're saying that apparently women are paid 64% lower than men,

1891
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:20,000
while the median is 34% lower.

1892
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:30,000
So they're saying that on average the female employee makes 0.36 euro for every 1 euro made by a man.

1893
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
So that's terrible.

1894
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Why is it so fucking hard to not pay women and men the same?

1895
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Why is this so hard? Why is this a challenge?

1896
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Now I realize that you said euros, so this is a problem that goes beyond.

1897
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
We talk about it here in this country, but clearly this is a problem in a lot of other places too.

1898
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Yeah, it's worldwide. But what I want to know, and don't get me wrong,

1899
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I think that there is a problem with pay scale and making sure everyone's paid fairly,

1900
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:01,000
but we're talking female programmers and male programmers, same job?

1901
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Or are we just talking overall in the company maybe women don't hold the same positions as men there?

1902
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
And that could be a whole other issue altogether.

1903
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Exactly. My brain went there too.

1904
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Maybe they're averaging everything and you don't have as many women in leadership positions,

1905
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
which, don't get me wrong, is a whole other problem.

1906
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
But we need to get into, well, what is the root of this problem?

1907
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Are these numbers because women are not in these higher positions?

1908
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Yeah, and trust me, with Rockstar North, they make fucking Grand Theft Auto and shit.

1909
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:36,000
They should be paid handsomely. Everybody should be paid handsomely for that game.

1910
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says,

1911
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,000
People are told it's rude to discuss money so co-workers don't compare notes.

1912
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Also, there is a fear they will be resented if they make more,

1913
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:49,000
when in reality the underpaid person is far more likely to resent their superior.

1914
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
And this, again, this is another country we're talking about.

1915
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
This isn't, but, I mean, not to, I'm not trying to deny it doesn't happen here,

1916
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
because obviously it does, but I'm just saying this, again,

1917
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
is a problem in the industry, period.

1918
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Well, on top of that, too, I've seen it happen in many places of employment,

1919
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
but, you know, when you get a raise or when, you know, you get your hiring salary,

1920
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
they tell you not to tell anybody.

1921
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
And I think that that lack of transparency for people,

1922
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
now, I understand in some cases you get, like, a higher merit.

1923
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
For example, if you have a higher level of education,

1924
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:29,000
sometimes you'll get paid more than someone who may not have, like, say, gone to college.

1925
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
And it can also be your experience, too.

1926
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Like, if you're coming from a job, you know, that has a higher,

1927
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
you already have a higher salary in one place, you know,

1928
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
you might get hired on for more of a salary than you would if you didn't have a job with a higher salary,

1929
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,000
if they're looking at salary history or something, or how well you negotiate for your pay.

1930
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
But there still should not be such a heavy disparity.

1931
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Right. Right.

1932
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
It's disgusting.

1933
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
I wonder if, with the whole experience and everything,

1934
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:01,000
we're not paying now in this industry for a problem that's existed in the industry since the 80s and 90s,

1935
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
where women were, like, straight up excluded from a lot of elements.

1936
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I mean, granted, there was a lot of women that did very important things in this industry, right?

1937
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Like, Roberta Williams is one of the first that comes to mind, like, one of the all-times greats.

1938
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,000
But anyway, my point is, is that clearly you didn't have as many women in the industry then,

1939
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
so you don't have as many experienced people.

1940
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Now, again, I'm not saying that makes it right.

1941
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Please don't mishear me with this.

1942
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,000
But, you know, I just, I wonder if, you know, in trying to look for,

1943
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
how did we get here and how do we make it better, if maybe that's a cause,

1944
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,000
is that we're paying for problems of 20 years ago, which just goes to show,

1945
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
you can't expect the future to fix everything.

1946
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
You've got to fix things now because it's going to impact the future.

1947
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Yeah, and I can't imagine, like, even just in the gaming industry,

1948
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I can't imagine, like, a position that would be better, a female or a male would be better at.

1949
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I mean, it's just, honestly, I don't even really think about that when it comes to, like,

1950
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,000
games and programming and artists and stuff like that.

1951
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:55,000
It's just, like, your talent is your talent regardless of what your gender is.

1952
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
It's just, I don't know.

1953
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:02,000
I don't know how this kind of problem still exists in the world these days.

1954
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:08,000
But one note they did mention, though, they said part of the reason that Rockstar North is such an outlier

1955
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
is due to the lack of women in higher paying roles at the company.

1956
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:18,000
According to the database, only 8% of Rockstar North employees are in the top quartile of hourly pay at the company,

1957
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:25,000
are women, and most of the women in the company work in lower roles at the lower end of the pay scale.

1958
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
All right. Well, I don't know if this is a problem we can solve near an Orange Lounge radio.

1959
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
But, A, it shouldn't be this hard.

1960
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,000
B, you know, we have to put these issues out there and highlight them and point and say that is a problem

1961
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
in order for something to get done about it.

1962
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Correct. And not to say that everybody should just jump ship from a company or something like that,

1963
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:51,000
but, like, a lot of people, and it doesn't necessarily have to be with discrepancy in pay,

1964
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:57,000
it could be just they don't like the, you know, not the ethics,

1965
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:03,000
but, like, the environment of a big AAA publisher or they're looking to be creative on their own or something like that,

1966
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,000
and a lot of people are spinning off in their own indie studios and being successful,

1967
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,000
so that might be an option as well. I mean, I don't know.

1968
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,000
But, then again, it's Rockstar, and Rockstar's fucking Rockstar, so, you know.

1969
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Well, you know who has to be willing to bring up that there's an issue with how women get paid?

1970
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Men.

1971
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Which is also stupid.

1972
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
It just goes back...

1973
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Would you say that's true, though, what I just said?

1974
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Well, yes. I mean, they...

1975
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:38,000
But the thing is that that goes back to remember that thing where the male co-worker and female co-worker traded their signatures,

1976
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
and suddenly all the things that she had been complaining about he saw happening,

1977
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:47,000
and, like, oh, well, this is really happening, and no one believed it until a man said it,

1978
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
where we've been saying this shit for years.

1979
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
You should have fucking listened in the first place.

1980
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Stupid.

1981
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:59,000
All right, well, let's move on to a story to hopefully make us feel a little better,

1982
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:03,000
because this story involves, you know what, throwing it up and going outside.

1983
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:08,000
It's a story about Pokemon Go, which, you know, all of us here at OLR play in some capacity,

1984
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
some of us a little more than others.

1985
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:15,000
But, anyway, Pokemon Go trying to do some good things in the real world here with an Earth Day celebration.

1986
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:21,000
They're encouraging folks to actually help clean up the world on April 22nd, which is Earth Day.

1987
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Niantic is in a partnership with Mission Blue, PlayMob, and local nonprofits to encourage Pokemon Go players

1988
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:31,000
to go to select places and pick up trash and clean up the environment.

1989
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:36,000
If so many players do this, and they are watching, like, how many people actually contribute to this,

1990
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:43,000
then globally players will earn boosts to stardust when catching ground, water, and grass-type Pokemon,

1991
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:47,000
you know, earthy things, depending on how many registered players are in the area.

1992
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
So that's pretty cool.

1993
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
You know, they did something like this in Ingress as well.

1994
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,000
They did the Mission Days, and I can't remember, oh, God, they had a special name to them.

1995
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Maybe a Zet knows, because I don't remember what they were called.

1996
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
But Operation Clear Blue, that was it, right?

1997
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:06,000
But Ingress did something similar where, you know, they encouraged these public service type of days, too.

1998
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:11,000
So Niantic has a little bit of experience with this.

1999
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Also, speaking of Niantic and things that they're doing involving Pokemon Go,

2000
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:20,000
you may or may not remember, there's a class-action lawsuit that was filed about Pokemon Go Fest,

2001
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:26,000
and this was because people paid money to travel, fly into, stay in hotels at the Pokemon Go Fest,

2002
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
only to have the game not fucking work.

2003
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Now, people were already given, what, the cost of their ticket back and, like, $100 in Pokemon Go currency.

2004
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Well, Niantic just settled a class-action lawsuit over the festival, $1.57 million to settle this.

2005
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:52,000
There's going to be an official website that will open by May 25th, and this payout will help cover hotel and transportation costs.

2006
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
You have to read the fine print, though, if you were affected by this.

2007
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
You will need evidence that you were there.

2008
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:02,000
You have to have checked into the festival on Pokemon Go, meaning you didn't sell your ticket to somebody else.

2009
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
You have to show receipts if there were more than $107 in expenses,

2010
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,000
so be prepared to contact the hotel and get your folio and all that stuff.

2011
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
And this may not, you may not get reimbursed dollar for dollar,

2012
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
because lawyer fees are going to be impacted here and all this other stuff, too,

2013
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:22,000
but you may at least be able to get some of it back, which I guess is better than nothing.

2014
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:28,000
So, a little bad news there on Pokemon Go, and I really just don't see them trying to do something of this scale again.

2015
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
They've been having a lot more success with the local community days, I think,

2016
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
which we have a Mareep event coming up this Sunday.

2017
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Well, it's good, too, because, like, I hate, I wouldn't want to have to fly all the way to Chicago

2018
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,000
to play, like, an event like that. I like that it's anywhere.

2019
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Well, at least with Ingress, they kind of travel around to a lot of different cities,

2020
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:54,000
although they seem to keep skipping Sacramento again and again, but that's another conversation.

2021
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
At least we had one in San Francisco, which is a reasonably close distance,

2022
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:01,000
and, like, they're doing one in San Diego, Las Vegas, Portland.

2023
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,000
So, you know, there's cities that we can get to in a reasonable amount of time and so forth,

2024
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,000
so, by driving or whatever, so at least they're kind of doing these sorts of events.

2025
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,000
But Ingress just doesn't have nearly as many people as Pokemon Go has,

2026
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
which is kind of how they can get away with it,

2027
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
and probably why they thought Pokemon Go Fest would not be any big deal,

2028
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:25,000
because, remember, I missed an episode of OLR a couple years ago

2029
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
because I went to Chicago to participate in a Niantic event, and it was fine.

2030
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
It was Ingress, not Pokemon Go, but it went off fine.

2031
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Our phones worked.

2032
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:41,000
The only difficulty we ran into was that some dummy decided it would be a good idea to have a shard,

2033
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
which is one of the things you're trying to control, at Trump Tower.

2034
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
I said, tump.

2035
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,000
At Trump Tower, they actually had a shard spawn there,

2036
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
and this was, like, two days after those massive protests.

2037
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
You remember when there were all those protests after election day?

2038
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Yeah.

2039
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Yeah, there were all these protests going on, so the police were out.

2040
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,000
We couldn't get to this shard, so we had to sneak in a dunk of donuts across the street and do it there,

2041
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
and we got donuts.

2042
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Donuts and a shard.

2043
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
That's right, donuts and a shard.

2044
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
It's win-win.

2045
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Actually, we lost the shard to the other team, because they had way more-

2046
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
They also wanted donuts.

2047
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Well, they saw what we were doing, too, so they figured it out,

2048
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
but they also had way more fucking people than we did.

2049
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,000
I remember my little team of, like, nine people, and we'd be standing there like,

2050
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
yeah, we're defending this portal, woo, and then it was a nighttime anomaly, right?

2051
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:27,000
So you'd see all these blue, which is the opposition color for me in the game,

2052
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
you'd see all these blue glow sticks and blue lights down the street,

2053
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
slowly moving your direction as you were just sitting there going, ah, fuck.

2054
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
There's nothing we're going to be able to do.

2055
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
We're not going to be able to hold it against that many people.

2056
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:40,000
But we had fun trying, and that's the important part.

2057
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
All right, let's move on.

2058
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Dark Sakura.

2059
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Well, last but not least for me, there may be potentially another Nier game.

2060
01:50:52,000 --> 01:51:02,000
The creator of Nier Automata, that's Yoko Taro, and Yosuke Saito is the producer,

2061
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,000
and Keiichi Okabe, who is the composer, actually answered some questions,

2062
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,000
and of course the game came up quite a bit.

2063
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,000
And so while there weren't a few leaks out there,

2064
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:19,000
there was a point where Saito spoke possibly about returning to the series.

2065
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,000
So then of course it made everybody super happy,

2066
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:29,000
but the quote is, I do think that we might be able to open the door in the Nier universe.

2067
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I don't know how long it might take, but I do want you guys to look forward to that.

2068
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:42,000
So they did say that they weren't super happy with the idea of making a sequel,

2069
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
but maybe something in the same universe.

2070
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
So there you go.

2071
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:52,000
I know a lot of people really want to see that series continue in one way or another,

2072
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
so this will be good news, I guess.

2073
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Yeah, I think it would be hopefully pretty neat.

2074
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
So, I mean, it'd be nice.

2075
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I had the game on my wish list for a long time,

2076
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:08,000
but maybe now, especially if they're going to do more with it, I'll be interested in playing it.

2077
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,000
All right, just a few more stories before we get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

2078
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
all one word on Skype.

2079
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
But first, Loki.

2080
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:24,000
So, you may remember that there was, well, last year kind of started this whole really terrible loot box thing

2081
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
where companies were kind of interjecting loot boxes in the games

2082
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
where it really didn't have any place to be.

2083
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:36,000
One of those, of course, that can seem to be kind of ruined by this was Middle-Earth Shadow of War.

2084
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:45,000
So now, fast forward to this week, we get a comment from developers of the game,

2085
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:50,000
or I should say the publisher of Warner Brothers, talking about what they're going to do to fix that.

2086
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,000
And so they have decided that they're going to remove the loot boxes from the game.

2087
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
They stated,

2088
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:02,000
The core promise of the Nemesis system is the ability to build relationships with your personal allies and enemies

2089
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
in a dynamic, open world.

2090
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,000
While purchasing Orcs in the market is more immediate and provides additional player options,

2091
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:16,000
we have come to realize that providing this choice risks undermining the heart of our game, the Nemesis system.

2092
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:21,000
It allows you to miss out on awesome player stories you have otherwise created

2093
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:26,000
and compromises those same stories if you don't buy anything.

2094
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:31,000
And simply being aware that they are available for the purchase reduces the immersion in the world

2095
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:35,000
and takes away from the challenge of building your personal army and your fortresses.

2096
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
In order to fully restore the core promise of the Nemesis system,

2097
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:44,000
we will be permanently removing gold, war chests, and the market from Shadow of War.

2098
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Removing it on July 17th, of course.

2099
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,000
That's almost a year after the game came out.

2100
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:58,000
So really, all this is to is try to save some face now that this stuff isn't selling as well as it used to.

2101
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Because, don't give me this shit that they didn't fucking know this ruined this from the get-go.

2102
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Because people were fucking telling them every single day that it was.

2103
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
So don't be fooled.

2104
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:15,000
It is nice, I guess, to see a lot of these companies are starting to go,

2105
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
whoops, we maybe need to do a swift turnaround on this stuff.

2106
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
No, it's just the same face. They didn't feel bad for it.

2107
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
If they felt bad for it, they would have made ac...

2108
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
They would have...

2109
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Oh no, I'm not saying they felt bad.

2110
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
I'm just saying the reality is they realized they have to do this.

2111
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Alright.

2112
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
I just, I don't forgive them.

2113
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I didn't buy the game, so, you know.

2114
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Me neither.

2115
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
No skin off my back, so.

2116
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Alright.

2117
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Now I got one more story for you guys, and I saved the best for last.

2118
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Although, you have to file this in the category of rumors.

2119
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Jamie, I want you to try to not get too excited at what I'm about to say, okay?

2120
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Try me.

2121
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:52,000
But apparently, Nintendo has recently been revamping the Animal Crossing site.

2122
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
And in the revamp of this site, there's a lot of placeholders.

2123
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Placeholders in places like the news page and the video page.

2124
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
So there are placeholders all over the place.

2125
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:09,000
In fact, the Twitter account Leak Review did a very detailed analysis about what this could all mean,

2126
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,000
and how all these pages with Lauren Ipsum all over it and stuff,

2127
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:18,000
where there's soon to be more copy for possibly some type of unannounced game.

2128
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,000
So Dark Sakura, you know what they might announce at E3.

2129
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Amiibo Festival 2.

2130
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Hey, you know what? I also wouldn't be unhappy by that.

2131
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Oh really? Oh yeah, sorry, you're like the one person I know that liked that game.

2132
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
You know, they have those Amiibos marked down a lot.

2133
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
They're like two bucks.

2134
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
I already own them all.

2135
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Yeah, I know.

2136
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Well, you can own second copies.

2137
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Buy me some. No, I'm just kidding.

2138
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
So, again, it's a stretch.

2139
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
We're reading the tea leaves the way we want to read them.

2140
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,000
But, you know, it seems like wild hopes.

2141
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Perhaps, perhaps they're not bringing back Virtual Console

2142
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:57,000
because they're going to include Virtual Console games within Animal Crossing.

2143
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Stop fucking with my emotions.

2144
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Well, you know about Amazon France had Animal Crossing 3D

2145
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,000
as a placeholder for September 28th release.

2146
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Huh.

2147
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Yeah.

2148
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
3D, like another, oh god.

2149
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
They listed Animal Crossing 3D.

2150
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,000
If they do another 3DS game, so help me god.

2151
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
I actually wouldn't be mad at it.

2152
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
I would.

2153
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
I would.

2154
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
It is time for a fucking Switch game.

2155
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,000
But, you know, it could just be a placeholder,

2156
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
but it was something on there, so.

2157
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
All right.

2158
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Well, everybody brace yourselves to the upcoming Nintendo Direct.

2159
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
JD says, stop hating on the 3DS.

2160
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I am not hating on the 3DS.

2161
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:42,000
The 3DS is a great console from the years 2006 to 2016,

2162
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
but it's time to move on.

2163
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
The Switch is here, yo.

2164
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
All right.

2165
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
We'll see.

2166
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
We'll see.

2167
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
We'll see.

2168
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Anyway, if you want to give us a call and yell about Animal Crossing

2169
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
or anything that's on your mind,

2170
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,000
the Skype line is open now over at Orange Lounge Radio,

2171
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
all one word on Skype if you want to get through.

2172
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Again, that is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2173
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,000
JD says Nintendo is releasing stuff through 2019.

2174
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Yes, I know.

2175
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
The Luigi's Mansion remake no one asked for.

2176
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,000
My Switch can't fit in my pocket like my 3DS can.

2177
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Well, you just need bigger pockets.

2178
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
No, you know, JD, here's the thing.

2179
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Fuck gender roles.

2180
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
You get to carry a purse now.

2181
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
It's a fanny pack.

2182
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
You get to carry a purse.

2183
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
No, not a fanny pack.

2184
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,000
You are going to carry a man purse with you,

2185
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,000
and you keep your Switch in your purse.

2186
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:35,000
JD says I would lose it.

2187
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Have you ever lost your purse, Dark Sakura?

2188
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
They're pretty, I guess.

2189
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Never.

2190
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Yeah, I guess if you, I guess it could be,

2191
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I could see like leaving, you know, I lost my little gotcha,

2192
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
the little Pokemon Go auto-catching thing.

2193
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I lost that gotcha in a fucking lift in Atlanta

2194
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
when I was there.

2195
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
I had to buy a new one.

2196
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Isn't that depressing?

2197
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I know I'm depressed.

2198
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I'm depressed.

2199
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
All right, let's get to a call.

2200
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,000
We have a call on the line.

2201
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2202
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Who's this?

2203
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Hi, this is Ray Jeter.

2204
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Hey, Ray Jeter.

2205
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
What's on your mind?

2206
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Not a whole lot.

2207
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,000
You know, as you were mentioning,

2208
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
towards the beginning of the show, you know,

2209
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:15,000
for Episcopal Knights, you had been streaming Nino Kundi 2.

2210
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Yes, been streaming Nino Kundi 2, yep.

2211
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Yeah, in fact, I had caught the streams

2212
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
and we were chatting about RPGs.

2213
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Now, all that being said,

2214
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I'm going to make this call really to RPGs.

2215
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Yeah, I would like to pose this to the three of you

2216
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,000
and if Chad wants the answer too, by all means, answer.

2217
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Okay, what's that?

2218
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:46,000
At least you specifically are known to love RPGs.

2219
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Now, case in point, Mass Effect 3,

2220
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
you bought that god damn sound many times.

2221
01:58:51,000 --> 01:59:01,000
That being said, what game drew you into the RPG genre first

2222
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:05,000
and why are you such a fan of this genre?

2223
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
What game, and I'm going to open this to all our hosts

2224
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
because I know you all like RPGs,

2225
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
what game got you into the RPG genre

2226
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
and what was it about that game that you enjoyed the most?

2227
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:18,000
For me, it was honestly probably the original Dragon Warrior

2228
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
because that's what they called it here on the NES.

2229
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I mean, that's the first one I remember playing

2230
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,000
that had the whole strategy guide that came with it and everything

2231
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
because I could go further back to the 2600

2232
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
and stuff like Adventure and things like that,

2233
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:33,000
but I mean, those were more kind of like action-based games.

2234
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I don't think you really got the roleplay in that same sense

2235
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
until we really got to the NES and some of those early games,

2236
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
so that was kind of the early one for me.

2237
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
What did I like about those games?

2238
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Probably the fact that they were a little more story-driven,

2239
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
that it was an open world, even though when you kind of look back,

2240
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
a lot of those early RPGs,

2241
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
especially the original Final Fantasy and stuff,

2242
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
they weren't as open as you think.

2243
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
You could go around one little part of the world

2244
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,000
and then it was like, oh, but to get to this world,

2245
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
you're going to need a boat,

2246
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
and to get to this thing, you're going to need an airship,

2247
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
and to this thing, everything is kind of tunneled in that sense,

2248
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,000
even in the earliest RPGs, but it did feel open,

2249
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,000
and what I liked about it is that if you were kind of struggling

2250
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
and having problems getting past a certain point,

2251
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
you could kind of level up your character

2252
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
and you could get past that point by just kind of like

2253
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
persistence pays off.

2254
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,000
And that's true of other genres of games, too.

2255
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,000
If you want to do good in a game like a platforming game

2256
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
like, I don't know, Spyro, like we talked about earlier,

2257
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
if you have a difficult level,

2258
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
you got to keep practicing and practicing and practicing,

2259
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
and again, eventually that persistence pays off.

2260
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:37,000
And I think in an RPG, especially those old JRPGs,

2261
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,000
you really felt that, which is why I'm really harsh

2262
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
on Final Fantasy VIII sometimes,

2263
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
because that is one of the first games I remember playing

2264
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
where persistence didn't pay off,

2265
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
because the enemies would level as you did

2266
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
and there was this whole other system in it and stuff,

2267
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
and so that's why, and again, I'm not trying to open up

2268
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
this whole thing for debate again.

2269
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,000
It's not up for debate. How I feel is not up for debate.

2270
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
But I respect that there are people that enjoy Final Fantasy VIII,

2271
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,000
but for me, I just have a lot of negative connotations with it

2272
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
because that is when I remember feeling like,

2273
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:09,000
oh, this is an RPG that kind of doesn't have

2274
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
a lot of what I've enjoyed in other games and so forth.

2275
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
But again, as far as Final Fantasy VIII goes,

2276
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
the story is good if you're willing to put up

2277
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,000
with the game mechanics to get there.

2278
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
So my problem was never the story.

2279
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
And as RPGs kind of continued on, I think stories,

2280
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
especially in games like Final Fantasy,

2281
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
when we got to VII, but even VI,

2282
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
I mean, or when it was on the Super Nintendo

2283
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
here in America when I was a teen, it was Final Fantasy III, right?

2284
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Anybody my age that played Final Fantasy III in the US

2285
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
at that age remembers that fucking opera scene.

2286
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
And that's like the earliest version of a Final Fantasy cut scene

2287
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,000
was the opera scene, and it was fantastic.

2288
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Anyway, I've blabbed long enough. How about my co-host?

2289
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Loki, your first RPG, and what made you enjoy RPGs?

2290
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Probably Dragon Warrior as well.

2291
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I don't know. I don't remember a whole ton of what I played.

2292
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Early stuff. Like, I can't think of a particular RPG.

2293
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,000
I just know, like, I used to play a lot of the Final Fantasy games.

2294
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:13,000
I remember Final Fantasy III or VI was, you know, really good.

2295
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
But I mean, I don't know.

2296
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
I know one of the first games I played I know was on the NES,

2297
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,000
and that was Dragon Warrior.

2298
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,000
How about Dark Sakura?

2299
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I don't even fucking remember.

2300
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
I just always played them.

2301
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
It's always been part of your...

2302
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
I mean, if you want to really go for it, I could probably say

2303
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Quest for the Rings. You know, the...

2304
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Oh, shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2305
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,000
On the Odyssey 2.

2306
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,000
On the Odyssey, yeah.

2307
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
We played a shitload of that game.

2308
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,000
So maybe you don't have that same recollection

2309
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:44,000
because you played D&D so much and paper-based games.

2310
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
I didn't play D&D until I was older.

2311
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,000
I meant paper games, though.

2312
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Yeah, but I didn't play those until I was older.

2313
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Oh, really? I thought you'd been playing those all the time.

2314
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
No, I'd been playing the video game ones when I was a kid.

2315
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Interesting.

2316
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
I mean, I guess if I was going to pick one,

2317
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I guess the Legend of the Rings would be...

2318
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:04,000
or Quest for the Rings would be the closest thing to my first RPG ever.

2319
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,000
You know, and I did a lot of text-based RPGs,

2320
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:13,000
and, you know, I really can't put my finger on it, you know.

2321
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:18,000
It could just be because I'm, you know, heading toward my elderly years.

2322
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Since my birthday's in two weeks.

2323
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Phantasm Chat says,

2324
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
I don't even fucking remember.

2325
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Y'all crack me up.

2326
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Hey, you know what?

2327
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:29,000
We can only give you truth here at Orange Lounge Radio,

2328
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,000
and sometimes our brains don't fucking remember.

2329
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,000
That's how it goes.

2330
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:37,000
No, I'm getting on in years.

2331
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Shake my cane.

2332
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Some other random answers in chat.

2333
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Bobby Black Wolf says,

2334
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I had the A, D, and D games on Intellivision,

2335
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
but I also didn't get them.

2336
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,000
You know, it may have been a little much for that age at the time.

2337
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Let's see.

2338
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Sia Tabiri says,

2339
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:56,000
the big one that got me into RPGs was probably Popolacross on PSP,

2340
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000
or Lunar for GBA.

2341
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
I love Popolacross.

2342
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Let's see.

2343
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Kossen says,

2344
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
I played Final Fantasy 1,

2345
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:05,000
and I was very glad to have the Nintendo Power issue dedicated to the game.

2346
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Kossen also says,

2347
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Crystalis.

2348
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
The thing about,

2349
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Crystalis is like kind of RPG,

2350
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,000
but there's this weird kind of like action element

2351
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
where it's kind of in a similar bucket to like the original Zelda to me,

2352
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
but certainly those games were just like gateway games,

2353
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
you know, in a way.

2354
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Like would I have enjoyed the original Zelda as much

2355
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
if I didn't have Nintendo Power?

2356
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
I don't know.

2357
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Like it would have been really hard.

2358
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
I'm not sure I would have ever gotten through the second quest

2359
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
without Nintendo Power.

2360
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,000
I don't know.

2361
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
I don't remember how I got through the first quest.

2362
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,000
I know, right?

2363
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Like we were just smarter then.

2364
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:36,000
I don't know how it is.

2365
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
All right.

2366
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Before I let you go, Spaznator,

2367
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
or excuse me,

2368
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
I always say your Skype name.

2369
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Sorry, Raginator,

2370
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
but when I look at the screen,

2371
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
it says something different.

2372
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Raginator,

2373
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
what about you?

2374
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
I'm flipping this question on you.

2375
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
What's the first RPG you remember playing,

2376
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
and why did you keep playing it?

2377
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
It's weird for me.

2378
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
You know,

2379
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,000
I had both Final Fantasy 1

2380
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,000
and Dragon Warrior for the NES,

2381
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
but bear in mind,

2382
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,000
back in those days,

2383
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
my parents did all the game buying,

2384
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
and you know,

2385
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:10,000
a lot of times my father would buy games

2386
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
with himself in mind,

2387
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
so I just ended up playing it.

2388
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:19,000
And I thought those two games I just listed were all right,

2389
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,000
but I truly didn't get into RPGs

2390
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:27,000
until I got my PS1 back in 97.

2391
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:31,000
I happened to go up to my local Toys R Us,

2392
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:35,000
and they had a kiosking place for PS1,

2393
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:40,000
and they had a trailer for Wild Arms playing.

2394
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Oh, yeah.

2395
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Yeah, which included the opening cutscene.

2396
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:49,000
It's a side for anyone that has not played it.

2397
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:52,000
The opening cutscene was fully rendered,

2398
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:57,000
FMV anime,

2399
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,000
and I was just blown away by that.

2400
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I ended up buying the game,

2401
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
and once I got the game,

2402
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
I found out,

2403
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
hey, you know,

2404
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
there's actually a good game behind this,

2405
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
not just a nice cutscene.

2406
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
It's more than just a pretty face.

2407
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Yeah, my second one,

2408
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
which I got shortly after,

2409
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
was Vandal Hearts,

2410
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
which was put out by Konami.

2411
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Oh, I remember Vandal Hearts.

2412
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I played that too, yeah.

2413
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Yeah, really great story,

2414
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,000
turn-based, kind of like Final Fantasy Tactics,

2415
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:32,000
and then what really blew me away,

2416
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
even more so,

2417
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Final Fantasy VII.

2418
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
It was so cinematic,

2419
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
sweeping story, all that.

2420
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Oh, yeah.

2421
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Yeah, and once I played that game,

2422
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
if I wasn't sold on the RPGs

2423
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
based on the prior two games,

2424
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
I was definitely sold then.

2425
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I'd start buying RPGs left and right.

2426
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,000
The only thing that pissed me off about Final Fantasy VII,

2427
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
when I first played Final Fantasy VII,

2428
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
and I played a lot of that game.

2429
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I missed a lot of college just playing Final Fantasy VII.

2430
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,000
When I first played through that game,

2431
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,000
the only thing that pissed me off

2432
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
is that through the whole beginning of the game,

2433
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Aeris was part of my core party.

2434
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
It was like Cloud Aeris,

2435
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
and I think I was using Barret.

2436
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,000
So I leveled her up a lot,

2437
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I used her a lot,

2438
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
and then all of a sudden,

2439
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
she was removed from my party.

2440
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,000
So I was like,

2441
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Really? Really?

2442
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
All that weight? Really?

2443
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

2444
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,000
When I saw the one moment that you're referring to,

2445
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:28,000
I practically did a Darth Vader Revenge of the Sith moment.

2446
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,000
No!

2447
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Yeah, right?

2448
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Whereas Dark Sakura was over there going,

2449
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Yes!

2450
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Chad Michael's on Drag Race

2451
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,000
when hearing that both queens would be saved that week.

2452
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Yes! Yes!

2453
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
That was Dark Sakura.

2454
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
That was me.

2455
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
All right.

2456
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Anyway, Rage Nator,

2457
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls,

2458
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,000
but thanks for the question.

2459
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
I appreciate that.

2460
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Have a nice night, old potato.

2461
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Killing, killing, killing, killing.

2462
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
You know you got busted for that.

2463
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I'm hanging up on you for it now. Bye.

2464
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
All right, so the joke behind that is

2465
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
there was this character in Ni No Kuni II,

2466
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
and I called her an old potato.

2467
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
She dressed fierce, but she looked like an old potato.

2468
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
And I was like,

2469
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
first person to tell me I'm that character or something

2470
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
is gonna get a ban.

2471
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
And so, of course, Rage Nator says something,

2472
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
so I actually clicked the button that timed him out.

2473
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
I thought it would only be like a two-minute timeout

2474
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
or something where it would just shut him up for like two minutes.

2475
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
No, it was a ten-minute timeout.

2476
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,000
At least it wasn't a ban.

2477
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
But I made good on my promise.

2478
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Anyway, lots of love I'm seeing right now.

2479
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Dungeon Buster talking a lot about Phantasy Star

2480
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
in the chat as well.

2481
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
It's a game that we kind of missed

2482
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
in mentioning our favorite RPGs.

2483
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
By the way, if you want to give us a call,

2484
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
RPGs or anything else,

2485
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2486
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
You know, my first memory with Phantasy Star though,

2487
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
besides like seeing it in a magazine

2488
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
and wanting to play it,

2489
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,000
because I basically was told as a kid

2490
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:50,000
it was Sega's version of Final Fantasy, right,

2491
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
which we all know is a real oversimplification.

2492
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
But that's, you know, what it was as a kid.

2493
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Okay, I wanted to play it for that reason.

2494
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
But honestly, my first introduction to Phantasy Star

2495
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
was Phantasy Star Online.

2496
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
And that game blew my fucking mind

2497
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
like when I played that on the Dreamcast.

2498
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Like that was the reason.

2499
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
It was pretty awesome.

2500
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
And I didn't play it enough.

2501
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Yeah, and that was only a couple years before 11.

2502
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I had to go to the ER while playing the Xbox One.

2503
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
God, I wonder where that game is.

2504
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Oh, because you played too much.

2505
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,000
No, no, no, because I ended up having

2506
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
cramps that almost made me pass out.

2507
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Oh my gosh.

2508
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
And I thought I might have had something else going on.

2509
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,000
I wonder where that went.

2510
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
I had that game because it was one of the games I got,

2511
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,000
because I actually won.

2512
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
It's funny.

2513
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I went to Accuse Our All-Nighter,

2514
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
and they had a raffle there.

2515
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,000
And I entered the raffle, and I won a Dreamcast.

2516
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
I was like, oh, okay, cool.

2517
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
I have a Dreamcast now,

2518
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:40,000
because I wasn't totally expecting to win anything.

2519
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
So then I remember buying a bunch of games,

2520
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
and one of those was Phantasy Star Online.

2521
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
But I don't remember where it is now.

2522
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
I have a lot of my other games I found Tony Hawk.

2523
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Well, we wouldn't be able to play it online anymore anyway.

2524
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Well, I don't care about playing it online.

2525
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,000
I was playing it offline anyways, because dial-up.

2526
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
I'm not going to do dial-up.

2527
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

2528
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
I had it on Dreamcast,

2529
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,000
but it was the voice chat of the Xbox version that got me.

2530
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Oh yeah, that was magic.

2531
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
When you could suddenly, like thanks to fast internet,

2532
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
you could use voice chat.

2533
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
It's like playing telephone all the time.

2534
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
You should just bring it back.

2535
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Bring it back as backwards compatible,

2536
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
and then add the voice chat in there.

2537
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Don't.

2538
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Don't.

2539
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Do.

2540
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Not.

2541
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Not.

2542
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Especially after we just had that story

2543
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
about the Xbox backwards compatibility.

2544
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Do not play with my emotions like that,

2545
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
because I will cry if that happens.

2546
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,000
I'm sure the next thing they'll bring back after that

2547
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
is going to be Game Room.

2548
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Oh my God.

2549
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Okay, now you're just making shit up.

2550
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,000
All right.

2551
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
One more shout out for our Skype line,

2552
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word,

2553
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
and you can give us a call.

2554
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Do we have any last minute stories

2555
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
before we wrap up shop tonight?

2556
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
No, it's been a slow week.

2557
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Yeah, compared to other weeks,

2558
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,000
it has been a little slower.

2559
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,000
It has been a little slower, probably.

2560
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,000
One of the wrestlers in WrestleMania today

2561
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
dressed up as Sub-Zero.

2562
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Oh yeah, that was all today, wasn't it?

2563
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Yeah.

2564
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Oh yeah, I wondered why it seemed like

2565
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
there were just a few less people than usual.

2566
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I haven't watched any actual wrestling in an age, so.

2567
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Why would they dress up like Sub-Zero?

2568
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:11,000
What did Sami Zayn do during wrestling?

2569
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
That's the only one that I have to keep tabs on,

2570
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
because I'm apparently his twin.

2571
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
I just have to learn to dance like he does.

2572
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Anyway, DC Nate in our chat room says,

2573
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,000
what a disappointment.

2574
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
I don't know if that's about WrestleMania or what,

2575
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,000
but yeah, anyway.

2576
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
All right, well, I don't see our Skype lighting up,

2577
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
so I guess that means we're gonna wrap it up

2578
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2579
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show tonight

2580
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,000
and participating with us.

2581
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,000
We appreciate all the feedback that we get from you guys

2582
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,000

2583
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,

2584
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:49,000
and we also appreciate five star reviews

2585
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
on a place like iTunes or Google Play

2586
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
or wherever it is you heard about this show.

2587
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Those go a long way,

2588
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
and we really appreciate those reviews as well.

2589
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
We don't ask for your money.

2590
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
We just ask, hey, tell a friend about the show.

2591
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Help us spread the word,

2592
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2593
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:06,000
but only if the voices are here to actually air them out.

2594
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:09,000
So, anyway, that's gonna do it for the show.

2595
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,000
I guess now we will go around and give everybody's final thought.

2596
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Loki, you got the mic right there.

2597
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,000
I'll start with you.

2598
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:21,000
My final thought is I'm hopefully gonna work on my game this week.

2599
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,000
I don't know.

2600
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
It's been like it's however brain dead I am

2601
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
after exercising and work in a whole day

2602
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,000
and being that I'm starting my new job tomorrow.

2603
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Congrats.

2604
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
We'll see how that goes

2605
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:35,000
as far as what mental capacity I have left at the end of the day

2606
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
to learn more about programming.

2607
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:41,000
My final thought is, hopefully,

2608
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
my eating noises have not been coming through on the microphone,

2609
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:46,000
but I've been chewing on some popcorn throughout this movie,

2610
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
or throughout the movie, throughout the show,

2611
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:51,000
and I need to stop eating these popcorn kernels

2612
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
because it's dangerous.

2613
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
It's so terrible for your teeth.

2614
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
But you know what is the best?

2615
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
You know what's even better than popcorn

2616
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
is those kernels that are like half popped.

2617
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Those are the best.

2618
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Somebody should figure out how to sell that.

2619
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,000
You know what's the worst?

2620
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Half pop popcorn.

2621
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
You know what's the worst?

2622
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Whenever I eat popcorn for some stupid reason,

2623
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
you get one of those kernels

2624
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
that just likes to get right in between your gums.

2625
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Oh, I have the solution for that.

2626
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,000
I bought this thing for my teeth called a water pick,

2627
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
and it was a good 60, 70 bucks on Amazon,

2628
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
but you don't have to floss ever again

2629
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
because that's what this thing is, is a floss thing.

2630
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
You know what?

2631
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:24,000
So you fill it up with water,

2632
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,000
and it's like a water gun.

2633
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
It's basically what your dentist will use on you,

2634
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,000
like a lower version of that.

2635
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
And so if I get popcorn stuck in my teeth,

2636
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I just go in the bathroom and just spread the word.

2637
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Well, that works if you're at home

2638
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
when I'm stumbling eating popcorn at work.

2639
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
I'm like, ah, current.

2640
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,000
You know what?

2641
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I have something even cheaper than that.

2642
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,000
It's a metal pick.

2643
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
There you go.

2644
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Like a dentist pick, a real dentist pick.

2645
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
All right.

2646
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
And that fits in my purse.

2647
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Yeah, Causton says,

2648
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,000
have you guys tried using those plastic brush picks?

2649
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Yeah, I used to use the little...

2650
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Things are a fucking waste of money.

2651
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
The flossy pick things.

2652
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,000
I used them.

2653
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
But if I had a purse, I would put those in them.

2654
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,000
You can get a legit narrow metal dentist pick.

2655
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2656
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
And use that instead of floss.

2657
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Yeah.

2658
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
And you pay two bucks for it.

2659
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,000
And you can sterilize it and keep it with you.

2660
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
As long as you sterilize it.

2661
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
And you don't have to fucking pay for anything else.

2662
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Those things can get nasty if you don't sterilize it.

2663
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Well, yeah, but that's, again, why you sterilize.

2664
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,000
It's boiling water.

2665
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:25,000
In an emergency, you can gouge someone's eye out with it.

2666
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,000
All right.

2667
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Anyway, Dark Sakura,

2668
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
I don't want to leave without getting your final thought.

2669
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
What is your final thought tonight?

2670
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Fuck it.

2671
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I like that.

2672
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
We'll see you next week.

2673
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:38,000
We will be back in seven days to do it all over again.

2674
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,000
So hey, thanks for joining us.

2675
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Back here live or on our podcast feed.

2676
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Either way you did it.

We appreciate you being here and we'll be back.

2678

2679
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
