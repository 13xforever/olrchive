00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
This week we don't have a script, but we do have a lead. John Cena's gonna kick ass and chew bubblegum. But he's all out of gum.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
This is just one story on tonight's show. Stay tuned for this, generational upgrades and plenty more news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Well hello once again everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
Orange Lounge Radio. Not live tonight with episode number 724 for this April the 1st of 2018.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
And that is no joke. No joke here at OLR tonight, but it is gonna be a little bit of Orange Lounge Radio unplugged.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
I'll get to that in a minute, but first I have to go around and introduce everybody.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
Myself, I'm Rob Roberts or on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joined as always by my co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Orange Dead Radio

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Orange Dead, yes cause we're not live.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Exactly. Dead. I like that.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Dead Lounge Radio.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
That would be the Halloween episode or episode 666 which we already did.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Yeah.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
We hit the point where we've already passed episode 666.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
We're beyond evil.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Beyond good and evil.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
What would be the next big episode number?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
777, the lucky sevens.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I guess so. I guess so. We'll be looking forward to that.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
We've already had episode gonanami.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah, I know. I know. They've all happened.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Anyway, also here tonight, of course, Techmaster Loki.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Hello.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
I'm fine.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Good. Alright, I'm gonna just ask you right at the top because I know somewhere out there, even though we're not live tonight, we don't have our chatters.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
We don't have anything going on, which is weird. It's like a piece of us is missing tonight, but that's why it's OLR unplugged.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
But I know if we did have the chat room going, Tigerclaw would be lighting it up going, Ready Player One, Ready Player One, Ready Player One.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
I saw it. I saw it. Did you see it? Did you see it? So, Loki, I'm sure you had to go see it.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I had to go see it. It was awesome.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
You didn't see it, right? Because I didn't see it.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
No.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Alright, I didn't think so.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
We were gonna go see it, right?

02:10.000 --> 02:17.000
We can. He wanted to go tomorrow. I'm supposed to play Pokemon Go with Shane tomorrow, but I don't know how into that he is.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I'm gonna go be a drag nun, so.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Tomorrow? I thought it was Sunday.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm leaving Sunday because I'm staying with JD.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh, well tell that kid I said hi.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I will.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Alright, anyway, if he's not listening to this, then hi.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
But JD's gonna have to put up with all of that makeup.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
The bathroom's gonna be white by the time I'm done.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Girl, like it's the first time. Alright, anyway.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
So alright, Ready Player One, the Loki review, and go.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Well, I mean, I really liked it. I knew I was gonna like it.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Of course you were.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
And it didn't let me down. I thought, you know, if we're gonna say, you know, video game movies.

02:47.000 --> 02:55.000
I think it did, um, there was definitely a lot of video game stuff in the movie. That's for sure.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
I mean, cameos like crazy of everything.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Just, um, and I think it's just really well done.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
I like how they incorporated a lot of even like Street Fighter was in there.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Um, they incorporated some of that stuff.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
Um, you know, I like the changes that they made against the book and stuff.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Some people had issues with that. But honestly, if you're gonna do it exactly like the book.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Some of that would have been really boring to watch.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
And that would have been something like if you were gonna stretch this out to like three movies or something.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
That you could have probably done that.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
But I kinda like how they did everything.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Let's, they have like, the thing that you see in the trailers all the time, like the big brace for the copper key.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
Like that sequence right there, it's done with no music whatsoever.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
It's just all sound effects.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
And like, I couldn't stop grinning. It was just so fucking awesome.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Like Tron awesome? Cause that sounds like something out of Tron.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
It was just like, just non-stop action.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Just non-stop, just crazy shit going on.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
So I know the movie got like overall good on Rotten Tomatoes.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
It seems like the feeling I'm getting on social media is kind of like, it's okay.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah, it's like the book. It's like the book.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
I mean, that's kinda like what it is.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
The book was just, I liked the book. I really liked the book.

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
But some, you know, my wife who's more sophisticated when it comes to reading, didn't really care for it.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Because it's just kind of, it's like trivia about it.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
It's like, the way I saw it compared to like, hey, you remember this? Hey, you remember that? Hey, you remember this?

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
It wasn't so much that in this. I mean, there was some things.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
But they really kinda toned that down from the book.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
I don't know, just like, I don't understand why this gets picked apart.

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
But like something like, Rampage the movie, you know, it's just, they expect it to be shit.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Did Rampage come out?

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yes, it's already out.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Oh, I'm...

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
No, no, no, no, I'm sorry. No, no, you're right. It's not out yet. It's coming out in a few weeks.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I haven't been paying attention.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Tomb Raider's out.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah, Tomb Raider's out. They're putting it out a little bit.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Which didn't suck, but wasn't great.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Same thing. It was okay.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
I think, I mean, this is just, it's a really excellent thing.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
It's kind of, they have like, you know, not to get too much into spoilers and stuff,

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
but like the main guy Sorento in this, he wants to take over the Oasis because he wants to monetize it.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
It's just like the fucking AAA industry.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
He wants to mind it.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
We're gonna put ads everywhere.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Like, they're talking about like, oh, hey, this is your VR view or whatever.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
Sorry, I just have to say, even when I'm not live, the Google thing gets in the way. Sorry.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
That's three weeks in a row, man.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
Sorry, guys. God, I can't, I can't escape the Google chat noise sneaking onto the show.

05:32.000 --> 05:41.000
So like they have like, you know, he's like, yeah, we figured out that it's gonna, we can fill up 82% of the viewers,

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
you know, field of view before they start having seizures is what they're gonna do.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
And it's kind of like, yeah, that's kind of like where the industry is going.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
So I was kind of neat to like tie in a little bit of like some of the, you know, current stuff.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Let me ask this real quick, though, like how many, since it is a gaming show, how many like,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
is there a lot of video game references?

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
Like all over the, just all the time, just all over the fucking place.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
So as a gamer, you felt very like fulfilled?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Yes, it's very fulfilling.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
And like, even if you're not so much a gamer, so there's a, there's plenty of references to it.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
It's not necessarily reference.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
I would call them like cameos and like they incorporate a lot of stuff in there that's from different things.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
The rendered characters look like they were straight out of a Final Fantasy game, though.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
There's, well, I didn't see any Final Fantasy characters.

06:23.000 --> 06:30.000
And I mean, granted, the last battle, the last battle scene, like you can't see everything.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Like it's just, there's so much going on that you're going to miss a ton of stuff.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
But like there was, I remember spawn was in there, which is awesome.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
I did see a cameo of Robocop in there at some point.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
Apparently at the end of the, that the last charge you kind of see in the trailer,

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
they do have, you know, like Tracer and stuff from Overwatch, the Battletoads.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
And apparently the Power Rangers are in there as well, like charging.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
So I don't know. And then like the last like battle, which is kind of out of the book,

07:01.000 --> 07:08.000
it's just, it's like, I don't want to spoil anything, but it's just like, dude, with that combination, you can't.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
An orgy, an orgy of pop culture references.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
And the end of the battle, Mr. Rogers in a bloodstain sweater.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Oh God, I hope that would, movie of the decade.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
The ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny. Remember that, right?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yes. Yes.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
That's what it sounds like.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
It's great.

07:22.000 --> 07:32.000
No, but it's pretty awesome. And like, I like even like Sorrento's like avatar kind of looks like this bulked up evil Superman type guy,

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
which I don't know if he was like supposed to be like that, but he sort of looked like a Superman type guy.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Every time you say Sorrento, I think of Sargento and what pizza.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Pasta sauce. Do they make pasta sauce?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah. Pasta sauce and cheese. They make cheese.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
It was a good movie. I liked it. Um, there was, I don't know, there's not really much I could really pick apart about it.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
I mean, it was definitely different than the book because they don't really,

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
well, the big part of the book was like you found the key and then you have to find the gate.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
And so there was like a challenge to get to the gate as well.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
This is more like you found the key. Okay, now here, open the gate. You know, it's like the gate's right there.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
And then the gate's just to get a clue for the next thing.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
You know, it's so they don't really kind of address that too much.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
Um, but I liked it. I thought it was a great movie. It's definitely worth seeing.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
And I saw it, I saw it in 3D and in the D box with the motion seats and stuff. That was fucking awesome.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
I forget the motion box is the thing cause I haven't seen a single movie and that's just Tron.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
Tron was eight years ago, or like seven and a half. It was, oh my God, I can't believe how like long ago that was.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Anyway, uh, we do want to get into the rest of the show tonight.

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
Um, before we get too far though, let me tell you what's going on in case you have somehow missed this announcement in previous episodes.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
So maybe it's your first Orange Lounge Radio. You never know.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Uh, there's people that find us through friends or other methods every week, so hi.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
Uh, it's a little different tonight. This is Orange Lounge Radio unplugged because we are not live.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
We usually are live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geeks Network.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
vog.network.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
But this week, April 1st, a little bit different because it's also Easter.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
And so we all have Easter family plans, actually.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
Even though mine are in the morning, you guys are in the evening and, you know, Jamie's all the way out in San Francisco.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
So it's just not going to gel together on April 1st.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I'm going to have a very, very gay Easter.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
That's, I'm kind of jealous. Anyway, um, so, uh, but here's the thing.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
Usually we would just take the night off, but we just had last Sunday off because my fault, I was out of town.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Well, really Bobby Black Wolf's fault because he had to go and get married.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
But I will say, I'm sure-

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
It's so overrated.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
I'm sure this is going to come up on his show because, um, I'm still going to do the call live on Sunday and I'm sure it'll get brought up.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
But I do want to just, you know, again, congratulate Bobby and Jennifer Black Wolf on their, on their wedding.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
And, uh, yes, there were lots of great nerdy references in it.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Uh, walk down the aisle to the theme from Final Fantasy.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Cool.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Uh, I remember Kingdom Hearts came up too at some point.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
Other nerdy things like Star Wars and like Weird Al kicked off the, the dance.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Although, speaking of the dance, I will say this about Bobby's wedding.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Did he have a polka?

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
He, Bobby, no, it wasn't, it was a tacky, you know?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Yeah.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
But anyway, uh, I will say this about Bobby's wedding because this was a nerdy reference.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
So good.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
I didn't even catch it until like Jennifer said, did you, did you notice that?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And I was like, oh my God, you did.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Oh my God, you totally did do that.

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
So they did this whole thing, like when it was time for them to do the first dance and Bobby kind of like said, oh no, no, no, we weren't going to do that.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Remember?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Like he's, no, no, no.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
And he's walking up to the DJ and I'm thinking like, oh, this is really awkward.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Right.

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
And then all of a sudden, like Jennifer kind of like pulls him in and the song starts and of course he's like super into it and they do this whole choreographed thing.

10:37.000 --> 10:44.000
They did the fucking scene from Final Fantasy 8, the ballroom dance scene, and they did the whole, where she pulls him in and all.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
So that was, it was all part of it.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
And then like, I know there's video of it somewhere cause there was a camera upstairs.

10:49.000 --> 10:56.000
So I kind of go from that whole like, oh no, like, oh dear, something's going on to that whole like this bitch.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Like when they get into the whole like thing, but it was, it was fantastic.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
I was like, you could probably even see me in the video mouthing to Alan, what a ham.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
But it was great.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
It was so good.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
And I love that it was a traditional wedding, but very peppered with nerdy references.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Like Ready Player One.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
It was peppered with nerdy references.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
I was more excited by that Katamari cake though.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
It was, sadly we didn't get to eat it.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
I guess the groom's cake is not necessarily something you eat at the wedding.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
That's dumb.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
It's cake.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
Well, I had never heard of the groom's cake tradition before this wedding.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Cause it's a Southern thing apparently.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
I had never heard of it, but yeah, he did have a cake and it's on my Instagram.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
It's on his Twitter, but the cake looked like a giant Katamari, which was very well done.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
But the best part about it, it was rolling up things that were like Bobby.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
It was like a microphone and a VR headset and like the, and I thought, oh my God, I love that.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
I love that.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
So, but we did get to eat like the cake cake.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
I don't think you'd really call it the bride's cake, but the cake cake.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
It was really fucking good.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
It was good.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
And like, I did not realize this is a thing I learned.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
You know, Bobby and I, we do have a lot in common.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
We're both longtime internet broadcasters, right?

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
Uh, but one thing I did not realize we have in common, we both love red velvet.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
And so did you just roll your eyes at me?

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
It's just chocolate, but they dye it red.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
No, it's different.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
It's different.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
True red velvet cake is, is a very, very chocolate cake that shines red when the sun hits it.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
It was, it was good.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Well, I mean, the cake was three layers.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
So obviously I had the red velvet layer and I'm pretty sure he did too.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
And it was fantastic.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
So anyway, congratulations, Bobby.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
But that's why we weren't here last Sunday live because I did take the trip out to Georgia to do it.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
You know what, Bobby, I've, God, I would, Bobby I've known because of this show.

12:39.000 --> 12:46.000
And, you know, obviously he led to the partnership that saved us from live through CC5 when they were kind of imploding and then brought us to the all games.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
And then obviously we created VOG, you know, together, you know, with, with our buddies.

12:51.000 --> 12:58.000
And so, God, Bobby's somebody I've worked with and gone to expos, E3 packs, all that stuff over for like 10 years, over 10 years.

12:58.000 --> 13:05.000
So I was very honored that he, he shared in a special day with me, but I will stop talking about that.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
Since again, I'm sure the folks that are listening on Sunday night are like, we just heard this on Bobby's show, but it was a great night, y'all.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
It was a great night.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Let's just, so this is unplugged.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
It's also unplugged because we don't have a show roll.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
Usually we have a list like Jamie's going to talk about this and then Loki's going to talk about this.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
Like we don't script the show, but we have like, we have a flow chart of how the show is going to look, right?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
We didn't do that this week.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
PowerPoint presentation.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
We don't have our chat room, which means if we get something wrong tonight, we're not going to be instantly corrected.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Deal with it.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah. You'll just have to send us an email to participate.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Anything wrong is an April Fool's joke.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
That's right. Very good. Very good. Anything wrong is April Fool's.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
It was intentional.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Got you good. All right.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
Let's get into our gaming weeks. Why don't we start off talking about that?

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
We usually do at the top of the show, talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Dark Sakura.

13:51.000 --> 13:59.000
Since I'm better at reading maps than my husband, I've been his navigator in Breath of the Wild again in our quest to get every single shrine.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
We were on the last shrine.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Wow.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
The one where you use the giant ball in Impa's house.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
I haven't played enough of Breath of the Wild to find them all.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Girl.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Girl.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
I need to go back and really like play that game thoroughly.

14:13.000 --> 14:21.000
Well, we were on the last one and then I told Dan that our next quest is to get all 900 Koroks. We have 120.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Oh boy.

14:22.000 --> 14:30.000
Well, you only need 400 and something to fill your inventory to get all the inventory slots, but we're going for completion.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
We're doing like everything. Poor Zelda's, they're like, bitch, hurry up in that castle.

14:36.000 --> 14:50.000
And then I'm still playing idle pouring. I'm still playing animal crossing. We've got more animals. It's actually really fun.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Are they still updating the mobile?

14:51.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah, they're still updating it like different things to do every month. Different ways to get your money.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
I don't want to say that game flopped because I know it has its fans.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
It didn't flop at all.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
But well, but it also didn't hit expectations. I know I've seen that.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Well, I'm helping it hit expectations.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
But I mean, I was actually going to say a positive, Jamie, if you let me finish.

15:12.000 --> 15:20.000
The positive was going to be, but they're still updating it. They're still doing all these tweaks to it that I'm just I'm just not hearing about because for whatever reason, it just doesn't have the same.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
I just want a full animal crossing on Switch.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I think you and half the Internet.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Right. Yeah.

15:26.000 --> 15:33.000
And so I've been, you know, living my Animal Crossing fantasy vicariously through, you know, the little teensy Animal Crossing.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
Sure. But it's been really fun. I'm super enjoying it.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
I've started playing Puzzle Bobble again, the phone version, because it's all I have time for anymore.

15:43.000 --> 15:51.000
I haven't touched Wow, which is sad. I probably should. But I need people to play with.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
Hey, Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick from Game Buoy, you out there?

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
They would be on the server when I am. But.

16:01.000 --> 16:07.000
It's a bummer. It is a bummer about the regional stuff, because I bet the girls gone wow team would love to have you.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
And it's a it's a bummer about the whole fact that you can't play with UK people.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah, it is.

16:13.000 --> 16:27.000
But I've I've you know, I've been thinking about putting some time into that once I get some of my responsibilities out of the way, because I even tonight after I go to the movies, I'm supposed to work on, you know, graphic stuff.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
But that's been the predominant thing is really I've just been like we've all been about Breath of the Wild at my house.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
Oh, and and and and I played a shit ton of World Cup soccer pinball.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
Pinball machine. Yeah, I saw your Instagram lighten up because you replaced a part, right?

16:42.000 --> 16:49.000
Well, Dan hosted League Night. There's there's two leagues in Sacramento. There's the Folsom League and the Lodi League.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
What's league like like pinball league?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Oh, I know there was a pinball league. That's cool.

16:53.000 --> 17:00.000
And I think that we had the Lodi League at our house on.

17:00.000 --> 17:07.000
Not this past Thursday, but last week, huh? And like 24 people in the house, so I just went and bought clothes.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
I'm down another gene size. Hey, hey, work.

17:10.000 --> 17:17.000
Anyway, so we they broke my goalie on World Cup soccer.

17:17.000 --> 17:25.000
And the goalie is actually a hard plastic that's mounted to a another metal piece and it moves back and forth.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
You can still do the metal piece, but the goalie is a little bit bigger.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
It's just a big hunk of plastic. And they broke my goalie off of the post.

17:32.000 --> 17:39.000
And so Dan ordered me another goalie, but he jury rigged my my old goalie so that we could still play the table.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
And he's put all kinds of LEDs in it. And he's finished Creature from the Black Lagoon, which he we sold one once.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
And he always wanted another. So he shopped it out. And now we have the getaway, which was high speed to.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
Yeah, I remember that. I actually remember that we have like so many Steve Ritchie tables.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
It's not even funny. High speed was one of the NES games, right? Like everybody knows him.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
I think so. They also did high speed. High speed was the one where you play as the cops.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
Well, the getaway is where you play as the guy in the Ferrari.

18:07.000 --> 18:16.000
And so it's another Steve Ritchie game, which the Steve Ritchie games, like, for example, there's Black Knight 2000 is a Steve Ritchie game.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
You know, the getaway, the new Star Trek pinball is a Steve Ritchie game and the new Star Wars one.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
I think he did that one, too. But he does really fast ones with like the button in the middle gimmick.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
And so I guess we've become Steve Ritchie collectors.

18:31.000 --> 18:38.000
And he's also a super nice guy, just, you know, going very deaf. But he's really, really just a cool guy.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
And so we've been doing a lot of pinball lately, just, you know, Dan shopping out.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
We might be selling Star Trek maybe because we need room.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
That's part of what you got to do. Buy, sell, trade.

18:51.000 --> 19:00.000
And my coworker and buddy Tyler, who changed roommate, went to L.A. and brought me back to new games.

19:00.000 --> 19:09.000
Well, new-ish, you know, new to me. I have now Puyo Puyo Dreamcast edition, Puyo Puyo 4 for Dreamcast.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
And I have Puyo Puyo Sun 64, which I wanted since that fucking game came out.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
And now I have it in a very nice box. It's really nice.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Awesome.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
And but I'm still working on finding something for Dan.

19:21.000 --> 19:29.000
So if anyone has any leads on a copy of Salamander Deluxe Pack for Sega Saturn for hopefully under 60 bucks, let me know.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
OK.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
So that's it.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
All right.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
And as the collecting world turns of the vault to Dark Saga's house.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
Well, we might be selling off some of the stuff in there, but the Saturn collection.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
You're still trying to unload that Ninja Gaiden trilogy, huh?

19:42.000 --> 19:49.000
We haven't really put much effort into it, but if someone wants to make me an offer on Ninja Gaiden trilogy, if it's under $300, I'm going to laugh at you.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
All right.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
It's in the box with a manual.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
All right. Let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week? What have you been playing?

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
I've been playing a few things, so I got Far Cry 5 because I was peer pressured by my.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
Well, it's not peer pressured, but I like at least to get the PlayStation 4 version.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
I was peer pressured because they're like, you just get a PlayStation 4, then maybe we can play.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
And I was like, OK, fine.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Because I wasn't decided between PlayStation 4 or PC.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
And I like Far Cry games. They're all right.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
And I usually get tired of them pretty fast, but the Far Cry arcade was pretty fun.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
So that's kind of the level creator that they have in there.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
So I've been messing with that a little bit.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
It's still kind of limited for what I wanted to make, but I could have quite a bit of fun with that.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
And then the actual game itself.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
OK, so there's this weird glitch that happened.

20:35.000 --> 20:41.000
So I was playing the game on normal, and then all of a sudden I'm in the tutorial.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I thought of Bobby for a second there.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
I was like, I can't pass the tutorial.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I keep getting shot to death.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
And I'm doing everything right. Why do I keep dying so fast?

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
Well, apparently there's a glitch in the game that all of a sudden randomly sets it up to hard mode.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
It just ramps it up all the way.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
And I was like, what the hell?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
And so I put it all back down the easy.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
And I was like, OK, that's way better now.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Now I can actually survive.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
But I posted on Twitter, and apparently Travis had the same problem.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
He's like, yeah, that happened to me too.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
I was like, that's weird.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
But yeah, the game is all sorts of glitchy bullshit, which means I love it.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
So there's that.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
And then I was actually trying to get some actual programming done.

21:26.000 --> 21:33.000
So I've been doing a lot of stuff, though, for work and doing stuff for something I wanted to work on.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
But it's more of education still, because I wanted to do a third-person shooter.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
But who would have thought it's so much fucking harder than a first-person shooter?

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
So speaking of work, a little birdie named the Twitter icon told me that you got a promotion.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Yes, I did get a promotion.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
A nice 25% raise too.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
That's special.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
You got money.

21:56.000 --> 22:05.000
Yeah, so I've been trying to get into this specific position ever since I got up to where I'm at now,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
because it seemed like it was really cool.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
It's basically people that it's sort of like an analyst position,

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
but it's basically finding efficiencies and implementing that stuff.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Oh, like business improvement stuff.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Yeah, so workflow stuff.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
A lot of that is tied to training, so I'm very familiar with that.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Yeah, exactly. So workflow stuff.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
And that's kind of what I do anyways.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
Any position I go to, I kind of master it, and I find shortcuts that do everything faster.

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
And so that's how I've gotten great reviews the last couple of years, just because of that kind of stuff.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
I started teaching myself JavaScript.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
Well, first I started off with Visual Basic scripting to do macros and stuff,

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
and now since I'm moving out of Internet Explorer, because no one should be in Internet Explorer.

22:48.000 --> 22:56.000
But I wanted to move away from that, so now I'm learning JavaScript to develop a Chrome extension

22:56.000 --> 23:03.000
to work with the stuff I have, because we use a database system, I guess.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
We call it Salesforce. A lot of big companies use it, Microsoft and stuff like that.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Isn't it built on an Oracle?

23:09.000 --> 23:16.000
It's something. I don't know what it is. It's basically a database of contacts and stuff.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
They use it for sales.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
I know Salesforce very well, and I know other people that know it very, very well.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
It's very popular in the industry.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Yes, there's lots of people that use Salesforce.

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
What we wanted to do, there's different quality of life things that obviously aren't going to be at the forefront

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
for our programs to work on, because we just integrated.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
We moved away from a terminal system into Salesforce,

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
and so I've been using the extension to build those quality of life functions on the client side

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
to do all the things that they want to do, since we don't have to bug the programs.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
I can just take care of it myself.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
It's like, oh, I want this button to do this and this and this.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
So in a roundabout way, all this programming stuff for the games you've never done

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
have actually kind of helped you out.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
Yeah, sort of. It helps me learn different languages a lot quicker, so that's good.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
No, but I really do want to get into making games.

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
I have been inspired, but the third-person shooter stuff, it seems like it's a lot to learn.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
I mean, it's just with the animation systems and stuff like that, but it's good to learn it, though,

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
because it's an important part of doing all these different things in Unity and stuff.

24:25.000 --> 24:31.000
So it's good to kind of learn that now instead of just going around different ways of doing things.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
So I've been kind of in just a learning phase, and it's been fascinating.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
So once I kind of get that down, then I'll start working on some other things.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
And I don't even know if the third-person shooter thing is what I'm going to end up doing,

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
but it's just more of just educating myself, especially since the last time I used Unity

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
was kind of getting into the five, and now it's 2017, and a ton of shit has changed.

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
So it's just kind of figuring out what all the changes are.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
All right, anything else for your gaming week?

24:56.000 --> 25:02.000
A little bit of Pokémon, because they have that new quest system thing, so that's been fun.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Yeah, that just started the day we're recording, yeah.

25:04.000 --> 25:11.000
Yeah, so I've been playing that a little bit, and then I've been...

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
What else? I played a little bit of Burnout Paradise Remastered, and that's all right.

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
Kind of sad that they just dropped the price $10, like literally a week after it came out.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Oh wow, I didn't even realize that.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
But I... whatever, it's fine.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
So I don't know, I'm just going to be playing stuff.

25:30.000 --> 25:37.000
I've kind of settled on the fact that I'm probably not going to buy any new games until the fall.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
But at the same time, I'm thinking, hey, you know, I just got this new job,

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
maybe I should reward myself with a Switch, so we'll see.

25:44.000 --> 25:50.000
I bought two games, actually. One of them I haven't played yet, but I just bought it today.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Have you ever heard of Leo's Fortune?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Nope.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
It's a little platformer where you play as a green, fuzzy, Muppet-looking ball.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
But it got good ratings. It's really pretty.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Cool.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
And another one called Human Fall Flat.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
That I've seen, yeah.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
Yeah, I got that one, but I haven't, again, played it yet, but it looks really neat, so...

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
I'm trying to do more, like, Mac gaming, because someone's gotta.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
Someone's gotta be the audience for that.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
But both of them are really high-rated, so I decided to give them a try.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I'm going to do my gaming week then.

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
I was traveling most of the time, so I don't have as many games, although I did bring my Switch,

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
and so I did play some Mario Kart 8 while we had some downtime,

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
because I noticed Sunday night there was nothing to do, so I played some Mario Kart 8

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
and some Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 and a few things on Switch there.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
But actually, just a little while ago, I was doing some streaming of Ni No Kuni 2.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
I started playing Ni No Kuni 2.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
How is it?

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
It's not bad, and it's not tied to the first one.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
It does feel like a different game in the same universe,

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
because I noticed right off the bat the combat is completely different.

27:00.000 --> 27:07.000
It's more like Kingdom Hearts type of combat than it is a normal RPG where it's like fight, attack, run.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
You run up, you can dodge, and it's more action-y kind of based.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
So I don't think you have to have a knowledge of the first game, really,

27:15.000 --> 27:21.000
although I did notice some of the location names are the same, so it must be in the same world,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
although I've only played the first chapter.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
I've barely scratched the surface, so not all of that's come together yet.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
But I was doing some streaming of that earlier on my channel, Rob Roberts, on Twitch,

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
so I was encouraged to play more, so I'll definitely play some more.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
It is a really good-looking game. It looks really nice.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I bought it on PC, actually.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I know most people are probably doing it on PlayStation 4.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
I felt for streaming it would probably be easier on PC,

27:43.000 --> 27:50.000
and then also I knew PC can run it at some higher resolutions than maybe what I can get away with on my TV.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
So yeah, I just decided to get it on PC, and I've been enjoying the game so far,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
so I'm hoping to play more in the coming week.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
And again, if you want to watch me play, you can over at Twitch TV, Rob Roberts.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
Speaking of Twitch, I've been playing with my buddy Delvin.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
Shout-out to Delvin, who's one of the hosts of the Video Game Realness podcast,

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
which they're still putting out new episodes out of Toronto,

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
and we were teaming up playing Overwatch together.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
So sometimes I will stream it, like we'll both be streaming it,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
and sometimes he streams it, and I'm just like,

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
Delvin, I'm going to join your game. He's like, okay, so I end up on his stream.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
So I've been playing a little more Overwatch because of that,

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
which is one of those games I haven't been playing a lot of lately.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
But there's a little more renewed interest in Overwatch right now

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
because they just put out Brigitte, the new character,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
so it's changed the dynamics a little bit.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
So that's fun. I haven't really played a lot of her.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
I've still been sticking to the characters that I'm decent with.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
I play usually Junkrat. I play Pharah. I play Orisa.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
If the group needs a tank, I really enjoy Orisa.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Do you do tongue pops?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
When I do Orisa?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Yeah.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Yes. God!

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
What's her catchphrase?

29:01.000 --> 29:07.000
So you play Orisa Edwards and Farah Moan.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Cease your resistance!

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I messed up the tongue pop.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
I couldn't help it.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
Let's see. And then what do I do if I need a healer?

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I'm a pretty decent Mercy.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
I still play Mercy, even though they keep thwappin' her with the nerf bat,

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
but I still enjoy Mercy.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
I sometimes play Lucio, but I think I'm just better with Mercy.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
So yeah, that's a little Overwatch,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
and I guess that's really all I have to say,

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
except I will quickly mention the Pokemon Go things since you brought it up.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
The questing is rad.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
If you haven't played Pokemon Go in a while,

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
fire it up because it's cool.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
Now you have two types of quests, basically.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
One of them are little daily things you get from bogey stops.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
The other one is kind of like this set adventure

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
that is going to culminate in the ability to capture Mew, basically.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
But what's cool about it is that some of the quest rewards

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
is not only another way to get XP

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
and get some of the stuff you would usually get from raids,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
but you can actually get XP as well,

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
so people that need more experience, this is a good way to do it.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
And it does throttle you.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
You can only do so much in one day,

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
but I got an incubator as the reward today for doing quests,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
and I was like, okay.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
I always complain about how fast you tear through those incubators,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
and then it's just like, buy more, buy more,

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
and you know that's how they're making all their money,

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
so I appreciate that there's ways to get free ones now in the game.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
They used to have it, though.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
You can sometimes get them from bogey stops.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Around Christmas, I think.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Was it only at Christmas?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I feel like they might have done it twice in the game.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
There was a couple-day period where every day you spun a bogey stop,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
you got one one-using incubator.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Yeah, that's what I like.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
They did that for a bit, yeah.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Yeah, so I think it was around the holidays.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
So anyway, that is pretty much it for my gaming week.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
So we will be back live next week, April the 8th,

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
so we will see you then,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
and then we should have shows pretty consistently

30:56.000 --> 31:02.000
until the end of June, the week after our 16th anniversary special.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
My God.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
This show will be old enough to drive right into a brick wall,

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
as we do every week.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Well, in Mississippi, we were already old enough.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
That's right.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
You might even be able to get married in certain states.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
That's right.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
Are we able to legally consent anywhere yet?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Other countries.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
All right, anyway.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I don't know, it would be old enough in Italy.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Let's get to some gaming news.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Again, we're unplugged tonight,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
so I have no idea what we're going to talk about.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Let's start with Jamie.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Throw a story at us, yeah.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
I'm busy updating my Mac, hush.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
So it's a game I actually,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
I didn't even know that it was out on iOS,

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
so I just acquired it today.

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
But Puzzle Fighter has actually gotten a rating for PS4,

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Xbox One, and PC in Europe,

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
and it is a translation of the iOS and Google Play version.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
So from their little...

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Well, we don't know that for sure, though, right?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
We just know the game's been rated.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
We don't know if it's...

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Well, yeah, but it's likely...

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Because it's not super Puzzle Fighter.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Well, yeah, I guess what I mean by that is

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
we don't know if it's going to be the free-to-play model

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
or if you'll get a bundle all at once.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Well, the free-to-play model that's out right now

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
for its basic features is that you can collect characters,

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
you can challenge people all over the world in real-time fighting,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
you have all kinds of Capcom characters,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
you get ranking points,

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
you can do world leader board PvP,

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
and it's basically just Puzzle Fighter,

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
which is funny because I knew two of the people

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
who did localization for Puzzle Fighter in the U.S.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Oh, cool.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
The original Puzzle Fighter.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
If I am... Well, actually, was it Puzzle...

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
No, it was Rival...

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
I think it was Puzzle Fighter and Rival Schools.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
That was Chris Tang.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Oh.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
It was in DDR.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Cool guy.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
Beat the shit out of my husband in Street Fighter.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
The thing I remember about Puzzle Fighter,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
I didn't play the mobile one very long

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
because you know how I feel about playing games

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
that I need a controller for on mobile.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
And that is one of those games.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
So I'm excited to hear I will get to try it

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
with a controller with this.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
But one thing I liked about it was that it wasn't just

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
the Street Fighter and Darkstalkers,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
but they were putting things like Dante

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
and like other Capcom...

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Frank West, who's in everything.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Yeah, other Capcom classic greats.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
He needs something to do since his series is dead.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Yeah, that's too bad, huh?

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
I bet you that series comes back.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
It's dead, rising.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
It will rise from its grave.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Rise from your grave.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Rise from your grave.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
It will come out again, I'm sure, at some point.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
To register participation for this week's episode

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Use the passphrase, graphic.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Reboots, that's what we do in entertainment.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Remasters.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Remaster, reboots.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Oh, a trilogy remaster.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Why the fuck not?

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Let's do it.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Everything else is getting a trilogy remaster.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
All right, Loki, we'll bounce back and forth here.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
I don't have anything else.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
All right.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
I'll just direct traffic.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Let's find something interesting to talk about.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Well, since we were just talking about Capcom,

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
we can talk about, I guess,

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Edition.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Oh, sure.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
So, yeah, that's gonna be pre-ordering on PC,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
And if you pre-order it,

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
you get Ultra Street Fighter IV for free.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
And then Switch, of course,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
since Ultra Street Fighter IV wasn't on there,

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
you get the Super Street Fighter II,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
the tournament battle.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Hmm.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
So, it's pretty awesome.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Except for the fact that I already have

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
that Ultra Street Fighter IV on PC, but...

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
But it has a meaning.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
It's got Street Fighter, Street Fighter II,

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Street Fighter II Championship Edition,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting,

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Super Street Fighter II,

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Super Street Fighter II Turbo,

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Street Fighter Alpha,

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Alpha II, Alpha III,

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Street Fighter III,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
III Second Impact.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Street Fighter 33 and a third.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Everything up until fourth.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
I don't see any of those bootleg ones.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Where's the Black Belt Edition, dammit?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
I want to be able to throw rapid-fire fireballs

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
and have them wave up and down.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Where's the one that did all the urban legend shit

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
where, like, you could stick Vega to the wall

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
and you could handcuff somebody to Guile?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
True story.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Arcade that I used to go to in college

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
that was actually in the back of a bar

35:06.000 --> 35:11.000
had all those bootleg modded ones,

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
including Immortal Combat

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
that started off with the last fight.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Oh, weird.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Yeah, but I've seen some of those,

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
like, urban legend editions,

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
the ROM hacked ones.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
They're pretty funny.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Yeah, where, like, somebody will be like,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
no, I swear I saw it once.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Guile handcuffs somebody to him.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Like, it's a move you can do.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
And it's like, well, because you saw some bootleg

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
from another country.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
But back then we weren't aware of,

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
we were naive to such things.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
We could have the internet.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Yeah, that's right.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
There was no Snopes.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
We barely had the internet.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
That's right.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Get off my lawn.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
All right.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Well, that'd be cool.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
I mean, we talked a little bit about

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
the Street Fighter thing last week

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
or the week before, I don't remember,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
about the whole, like, the tournament.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
And that must be the thing

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
that they're putting on the Switch,

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
but that's cool about the pre-order bonuses.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I mean, like, if you somehow missed

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Ultra Street Fighter IV,

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
which I don't...

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Street Fighter IV feels so much like

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Street Fighter II to me,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
because, like, all the Street Fighter II characters

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
are in Street Fighter IV.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Yeah.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Every single one of them.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
The last good one.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Yeah.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
So, anyway.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
You weren't a fan of Street Fighter V?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Apparently not a lot of people were.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Well, I don't know.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I want to give it a second chance

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
of this arcade edition.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
My girl's in it.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
Dan played a little bit of it.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
It was actually not too bad.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Yeah.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
I only care because I can play soccer right now.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
I want to give it another look.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Anyway, what do you have for us, Jamie?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Some Dragon Quest stuff.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Because, guess what?

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
It's not 9.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
It's 11.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Sorry.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
That was from before the show.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
When it's XI, it's 11.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Yes.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
It's me, Si.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
IX is 9.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Yes.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
X.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
But, yeah.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
G.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
It's Final Fantasy.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Or, not Final Fantasy.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Dragon Quest G.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
G.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Anyway.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
They...

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Uh...

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Deh.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
So, on September 4th,

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
Dragon Quest XI Echoes of an Elusive Age,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
and also Echoes of an Elusive Game,

36:53.000 --> 36:58.000
will be coming out on PlayStation 4 and PC on Steam in North America and Europe.

36:58.000 --> 37:04.000
We will also receive a Switch version, but it will not be finished for a little while.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
But, then again, we're also not getting the 3DS version,

37:08.000 --> 37:13.000
because, apparently, Squeenix wants to avoid dividing its focus.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
So, whatever.

37:15.000 --> 37:22.000
But, hey, at least we're getting support for Dragon Quest games, you know, officially now.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
It's gonna be nice to get Dragon Quest XI, seeing as Dragon Quest X never happened.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Now, I get Dragon Quest X as online, but it would've been nice.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
It would've been nice.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
It apparently will have all the pomp it's meant to have, so...

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Huzzah.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
I'll definitely be picking that up.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
See America, this face?

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Yeah.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
It tells you everything you need to know.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
Even though this is radio, we cannot see this face.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Dot com.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Alright, Logie.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
So, they're making a Carmen Sandiego movie for Netflix.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Yeah.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Who's Carmen Sandiego? That's the most important part.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Jennifer Lopez?

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Gina Rodriguez.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
That's not bad.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Who was in Annihilation.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Oh, okay.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I didn't realize they actually cast somebody. Okay.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Sure.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
So, that's gonna be a live action movie.

38:07.000 --> 38:12.000
And, then, also, apparently, they're gonna be doing another animated project that's coming out.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
A series that's in 2019.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
She'll be doing the voice of Carmen Sandiego for that as well.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Well, that's cool. They kind of do that to tie it together.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
I wonder, is it gonna be geared towards kids then?

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
Like, even if they're doing a Carmen Sandiego movie, are they gonna kind of gear it towards kids?

38:25.000 --> 38:31.000
I mean, it does say it's gonna be triple X, so, I mean, yes, I assume it's gonna be geared towards kids.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Triple X art core?

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
Where in my butt is Carmen Sandiego?

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
No, I think they're gonna do a kids version.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
I wonder if they'll bring characters to the game show.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
Like, they'll have the ch- I mean, honestly, obviously, rest in peace, Lin.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
Thigpen is not able to be the chief, but maybe they will have, you know, the same style that she did.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
They'll have, like, a chief of police. Maybe they'll bring over some of the stuff.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
Maybe the theme song will be that doo-wop, doo-ba-doo-ba-boo-wop.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
I doubt it.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
It needs to be the ending credits.

39:00.000 --> 39:09.000
I think the big climatic final scene in the Carmen Sandiego movie needs to be somebody putting together a map of, like, what was the heart of Africa?

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
Or, like, one of those countries or one of those continents where, like, it was really hard.

39:13.000 --> 39:19.000
Like, when the kid got, like, when the kid got, like, the states in America, that was always easy, right?

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
They would just breeze right through that.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
But when they got, like, Europe or Africa, it was, like, really hard.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
And they couldn't do it in an amount of time.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
You thought it was hard?

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
No, I didn't say I thought it was hard.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Like, when they had to, like, name places there or something?

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
No, like, you remember the big map on the floor?

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
That's right, that's right, that's right.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
And they have to fill in the map.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
But, like, some people, you know, and even- God, if you asked me to do it today, I don't know if I would.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
I don't know if I would. I wouldn't be able to do it in two minutes or whatever the time limit is.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
I would have to really think it through.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Well, countries today, though, are not what the countries were then.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
True.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
And, I mean, it's serious that borders, you know, change.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
That is true.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
All the time.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
That is true. But, you know, still.

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
Okay, if you had to name, like, if you had to point in an empty map of Africa and name every country, would you be able to do it?

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Because I don't think I could.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
No.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
I'd get South Africa.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
I'd get a good chunk. I'd get a pretty good chunk.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
Like, I can pretty much name most of the coasts.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Yeah.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
That's me, too. I could probably do all the coastal countries. Yeah.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Yeah.

40:14.000 --> 40:20.000
And, like, Northern Africa, I could probably do better because it would be Egypt, Lebanon, all that. Yeah.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
But, no.

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
Even Europe. Even Europe, I doubt I could do. Or South America. Actually-

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Rob, where is Luxembourg?

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Germany?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Luxembourg is a country.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I could do-

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
So it's not in Germany?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
I could do South-

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Y'all need education, okay?

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I could do South America.

40:41.000 --> 40:48.000
All right. Well, that, what Carmen Sandiego was how I was getting my education and it's gone, Dar Sakura. It's gone.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Well, I didn't do it.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
All right.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Girl.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
You did, though.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
All right, when-

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
I am innocent.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
When is the release of Carmen Sandiego on Netflix?

41:00.000 --> 41:06.000
They haven't said yet. Other than the animated series, which is in 2019, they haven't said when the movie's coming out yet, so-

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
You may get us wait.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
I think we need to see a trailer first before-

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Yes.

41:10.000 --> 41:21.000
Unless they pull, like, you know, hey, here's Carmen Sandiego. But they can't do that because we don't know where Carmen Sandiego is, so, you know, they can't show us that.

41:21.000 --> 41:31.000
You know, I always had this theory when I was playing the games as a kid that Carmen Sandiego was a code name for a big organization, that it wasn't a single person.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
I was getting into this conspiracy theory shit when I was eight.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Eight.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
You? You?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Me.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
All right. Anyway, what do you have for us? Another story.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
What, me? Me?

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Yeah, you.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Ikaruga.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Mm-hmm.

41:46.000 --> 41:51.000
Which isn't Radiant Silver Gun. I want Radiant Silver Gun.

41:51.000 --> 42:02.000
Anyway, the German USK has a rated Ikaruga for PlayStation 4 being, of course, developed again by Treshar. Treasure.

42:02.000 --> 42:08.000
And so, I'm trying to get what they said, though, the date on it, because the stupid thing isn't listing the date.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Wait, these are the-

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
This says it's rated, so no date on it.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
The German USK?

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
Yeah.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Is that in Luxembourg?

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
Fuck off.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
I'll show you Luxembourg when I kick you over there.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Fuck off.

42:20.000 --> 42:29.000
But yeah, Ikaruga is once again being released on yet another system, as if you didn't already play Ikaruga on, what was it?

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
All of the other systems.

42:30.000 --> 42:36.000
Dreamcast, yeah, it came out in the arcade, then we had Dreamcast, GameCube, Xbox 360, and PC.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
When is someone gonna demake Ikaruga for the 2600?

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
That's what we need to plan on.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
Would it kill Treasure to do a new shooter? I mean, to be fair-

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
Would it kill Treasure to do a new silhouette mirage?

42:48.000 --> 42:56.000
And to be fair, to be fair, new shooter games are coming out all the time in Japan, and so few of them make it over here, and I don't follow the genre close enough.

42:56.000 --> 43:02.000
I'm sure I will get tweets like, Rob, there's been all these shooter games you don't even know about, and yeah, because they don't ever seem to come over here.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Like, it's just not- the genre does not-

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
For a little while we were getting, like, some of them, like, when we got Death Smiles and-

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
I would think the-

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Mushi Himesama and-

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
The Switch would be such a good system for those.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
It would.

43:13.000 --> 43:19.000
Because you can flip it vertically, like, in the, um, Pinball FX3, it has a vertical mode, and you can hold-

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Yeah.

43:20.000 --> 43:26.000
Yeah, and, like, that would be fucking great for shmups, but for whatever reason we just don't have a lot yet, but maybe soon.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
And the Switch is region free, so-

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
How very dear they are.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Where is that?

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
But, cool, Ikaruga on PlayStation 4, why not? Why not? Let's do it again.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Ikaruga.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Why not? We did Rez again, let's do Ikaruga again.

43:38.000 --> 43:43.000
How about, just, somebody give me Radiant Silver Gun on Saturn, and I'll shut up about Ikaruga.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
Alright. Uh, Logi.

43:46.000 --> 43:58.000
Alright, so, there's this article that was about, um, I guess this Windows Core OS, which is, I guess, the next step for Windows 10, or kind of a tweak to it.

43:58.000 --> 44:09.000
So, what they're going to be doing with this, basically, I guess they're saying, Microsoft Windows Vision, which includes the idea of a gaming mode for playing games with an Xbox controller.

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
And, um, you know, they're talking about some of the features.

44:13.000 --> 44:22.000
Windows Seashell, it says, with the same kernel, a flexible core, and a unified app platform, the last piece of the shell, or UI, that itself can adapt to the screen.

44:22.000 --> 44:31.000
Taking the idea of continuum to the OS level, Seashell lets devices adjust their UIs for different tasks and experiences.

44:31.000 --> 44:39.000
A device running full Windows 10 for desktop would be able to take on a Windows 10 mobile UI to run in phone mode.

44:39.000 --> 44:46.000
Or, for example, a Windows 10 PC could take on the Xbox UI when in gaming mode.

44:46.000 --> 44:56.000
This means that we'll see an Xbox UI come to Windows 10, and this means we'll be able to launch Xbox games through this UI.

44:56.000 --> 45:07.000
This also means that we'll see third-party Xbox PC consoles, um, if the OEM wants to use the native Windows 32 support or not.

45:07.000 --> 45:25.000
An OEM can create an Xbox PC console with S mode enabled, which has native Windows 32 compatibility, and can switch between normal Windows 10, or can be based on Polaris, which has no native Windows 32, and based on the universal Windows platform.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
They're not going to make such happen.

45:26.000 --> 45:33.000
This also means, um, the future, we could see Xbox hardware that comes with a controller and a mouse and keyboard.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Hmm.

45:34.000 --> 45:39.000
So that they're going to turn the Xboxes into PCs, and the PCs into Xboxes.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Interesting.

45:40.000 --> 45:57.000
Um, and being that, you know, with that, there's also the possibility that, um, with this universal Windows platform and this special shell that maybe, since they're going to be running Windows 10, that you can get Steam games for your Windows, or your Xbox console.

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
So essentially they're just trying to make, like, the Xbox console basically a PC on your television at this point.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Almost.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Steam box, basically.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
Yeah.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
Interesting.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
I haven't heard a lot about Steam boxes.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
Interesting.

46:07.000 --> 46:19.000
But my thing with this, and like, don't get me wrong, it sounds exciting, but I remember talking with a Microsoft rep back in 2012 about this type of thing, and they were like, oh yeah, it's right around the corner.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
So...

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
Well, the games for Windows thing was like a very, like, Xbox 360 kind of shell around games.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
You know?

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
And there was stuff, of course...

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
It was a terrible shell.

46:30.000 --> 46:40.000
I got to pour one out for Game Room, because I'm always going to bring up Game Room, but that was one of those things that, you know, it had that you could play it on both sides, and it would remember who you are, and it had that same type of shell on it, you know?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Was it just ahead of its time, Loki?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Yes, I guess so.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
But, I mean, that's a neat idea.

46:47.000 --> 46:54.000
I'd be really interested to hear more about it and see when it's going to be implemented, because right now it's just kind of talk.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
I mean, I'm hopeful that they'll do something.

46:58.000 --> 47:05.000
I maybe need to see more Xbox integration, even more reason not to buy an Xbox One.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
It's kind of confusing.

47:06.000 --> 47:15.000
But I guess if they're still able to sell Xbox One games on PC, then does it really matter that they're not selling consoles that they don't make anything off of?

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
Well, I think they're still selling enough Xboxes.

47:19.000 --> 47:27.000
The question is, when they do implement this, and we're buying lots of Xbox One games, am I going to have to pay for Xbox One or Xbox Live Gold?

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
Because they're, oh, well, now you have to.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Whereas, no, we don't.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Who knows?

47:33.000 --> 47:44.000
But that's going to be hard to sell on a platform that can, you know, yeah, I could buy this game here, or I could buy the Steam version, which doesn't have to do that.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
We'll see.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
Maybe E3 will have some answers, but probably not.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
It just really sounded like their whole press release there was full of wind.

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
Like, oh, we're going to talk about kernels, as if we're Linux.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
No.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
We got one more from you, right, Jamie?

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
I'm sorry, I'm just completely unimpressed with Microsoft bullshit.

48:07.000 --> 48:13.000
So, 2018 World Video Game Hall of Fame finalists.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
If there are the finalists listed, you can still vote for them.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Wait, where is this?

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Oh, this is the Video Game Hall of Fame.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
Yeah, the Strongs World Video Game Hall of Fame.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Yeah, this does come up every year.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Okay.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Yeah, and you can vote for it.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
You have to look for the website.

48:29.000 --> 48:37.000
But the voting closes on, well, the inductees will be announced on Thursday, May 3rd, at 1030.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
So, you can vote for the following.

48:39.000 --> 48:48.000
Asteroids, Call of Duty from 2003, Dance Dance Revolution, Final Fantasy VII, Half-Life, John Madden Football,

48:48.000 --> 48:54.000
King's Quest, Metroid, Minecraft, Ms. Pac-Man, Space War, and Tomb Raider.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
And if you don't vote for DDR, I'm disowning you.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
I thought they already had Minecraft in there.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Maybe it was just nominated before.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
It was a finalist from before.

49:04.000 --> 49:08.000
Here's the thing. I went, and you can actually pull a Wiki article on all this.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
It's located in Rochester, New York.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
And if you want to vote, worldvideogamehalloffame.org.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Here's the class of 20...

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
Wait a second. I thought that there was another hall of fame somewhere else in the Midwest.

49:19.000 --> 49:25.000
Are you thinking of the one, the classics in Otumwa or whatever that town is, or all the 80s?

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
Something like that, where they were saying like, oh, we're the center of video games.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
That's Twin Galaxy's thing.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
No, that wasn't Twin Galaxy's. It was some like...

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
Are you to say that there is more than one place claiming that they're the hall of fame of video games?

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
Back in the day, the Metreon had that walk of fame, right?

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
Well, we're the video game hall of fame now, bitches.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
All right. Anyway, Loki, the one in Rochester, New York.

49:49.000 --> 49:56.000
Okay, so in 2015, they inducted Doom, Pac-Man, Pong, Super Mario Brothers, Tetris, World of Warcraft.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
Minecraft was a nominee. It was not inducted.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
So that's the difference.

50:00.000 --> 50:06.000
It's like how, what's the band that over and over again never gets into the Music Hall of Fame?

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Boston? No, Boston made it.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
There was some band that was getting nominated every fucking year and wasn't getting in.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
Was it Black Sabbath?

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
I bet it was Black Sabbath. I could be wrong, though. Don't quote me on that.

50:18.000 --> 50:29.000
2016 had the inductees were the original Legend of Zelda, the Oregon Trail, The Sims, Sonic the Hedgehog, Space Invaders, and Grand Theft Auto 3.

50:29.000 --> 50:36.000
And then in 2017, they inducted Pokemon Red and Green, or Blue, depending on what country you're in.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
Street Fighter 2, Donkey Kong, and Halo.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
So that's where it is right now.

50:40.000 --> 50:47.000
So now, yes, they have some holdover finalists, but there are some new finalists, which include Dance Dance Revolution.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
Although, I gotta be honest, how many do you get to vote for on this list?

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Three? Four?

50:52.000 --> 50:58.000
If I had to vote for four, I would vote for King's Quest, Metroid.

51:00.000 --> 51:04.000
I'm looking at the list. King's Quest, Metroid. Yeah, I'd vote for DDR for me.

51:04.000 --> 51:09.000
DDR and... I might do Minecraft. I don't know.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
But that's my opinion. I'm sure everybody else has theirs.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
I'd vote for DDR, DDR, DDR, and Metroid.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
Alright.

51:17.000 --> 51:22.000
I don't know, I'd probably give Final Fantasy VII a mention, just because I played a shit ton of that game.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Yeah, because you had to watch Aerith Die over and over.

51:24.000 --> 51:29.000
Well, yeah, that too. But it really was kind of a genre changer. You know, really it was.

51:29.000 --> 51:39.000
People, you know, I don't care if you hate or love the game, it has to be admitted that it changed things for RPGs.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
It was a moment.

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
It was a moment. We were all a little verklempt.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
Especially when I watch Aerith Die. I'm happy verklempt.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Let's do one more from Loki and then we'll do the classic game of the week.

51:51.000 --> 51:56.000
Alright. Let's see. How about we talk about Lindsay Lohan?

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
How about no?

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
Is she still in rehab?

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
I don't know, but Lindsay Lohan...

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
No, she's like the official spokesperson for like Lawyer.com or something now.

52:04.000 --> 52:10.000
Well, it's a good thing that she is a spokesperson for Lawyer.com, because I'm sure she's utilized them quite a bit.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
To sue Grand Theft Auto for...

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Again?

52:14.000 --> 52:19.000
No, I think it's the same lawsuit. It's been that long. Yes, that's right.

52:19.000 --> 52:29.000
So this lawsuit was basically, for those who don't remember, it was in regards to some of the artwork and characters that were in Grand Theft Auto 5.

52:29.000 --> 52:34.000
Mainly, I don't remember the name, Lacey Jonas, who was in the game.

52:34.000 --> 52:39.000
And she was kind of like this, you know, stall...

52:39.000 --> 52:49.000
There's like a Hollywood, you know, young, you know, kind of TMZ trashy celebrity person.

52:49.000 --> 52:55.000
You know, where she was, you know, had a sex tape and like getting in accidents for being drunk and stuff like that.

52:55.000 --> 53:08.000
And apparently they're saying, oh, you know, because the artwork has, you know, this blonde chick in a bikini that, you know, Lindsay Lohan has also worn a bikini.

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
But let me guess, parody is acceptable and it's parody.

53:12.000 --> 53:21.000
Yeah, basically they said that, you know, that her complaint that was, you know, lookalike and it looked exactly like her.

53:21.000 --> 53:31.000
But unfortunately they said that, you know, didn't find that the computer generated images, avatars or NPCs can legally be called portraits.

53:31.000 --> 53:36.000
And so they said that Jonas wasn't a portrait of Lohan.

53:36.000 --> 53:42.000
So apparently, you know, that's been dismissed.

53:42.000 --> 53:50.000
And yes, she is officially the new spokesperson for Lawyer.com, which makes this whole thing ironic.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
It's like Ray.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
So, I mean, just get over it, dude.

53:54.000 --> 53:59.000
I mean, like what? That game came out like how many years ago was that?

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
A little bit now.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
We're getting ready for Grand Theft Auto 6, although we got to get through it.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
It's like we got to get through Red Dead 2 first.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
2010, maybe.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
I think it was a while ago.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
All right.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Well, let's let's travel.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Let's travel back to simpler times, shall we?

54:13.000 --> 54:21.000
Let's step into the gaming vault and go back to a simpler time when Lindsay Lohan was getting Golden Globe nominations for the parent trap.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
When she was in Mean Girls.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
But she was a hot redhead.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Yeah.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Well, she was like seven in the parent trap.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
No, I'm not talking about then.

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
I'm talking about later when she was, you know, a hot redhead, not a tiny child.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Thank you for clarifying.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
All right.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
It's the classic game of the week.

54:37.000 --> 54:44.000
And once a week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks, hey, Bratz, play this game.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Put down your Bratz and play this game.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
I'll whip you.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Whip it good.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
And that's a pun because it ties into this classic game of the week.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Which pick Dark Soccer?

54:53.000 --> 55:06.000
I picked Akuma Joe Dracula, as in the version specifically that came out on the Sharp X68000, which was re-released as Castlevania Chronicles.

55:06.000 --> 55:18.000
But this one in particular was notable because the game, well, first of all, the original release date in Japan, which it only came out in Japan, was July 23rd, 1993.

55:19.000 --> 55:28.000
And the X68000, as I've covered last year in our classic console, the games ran on floppies.

55:28.000 --> 55:34.000
They were, you know, pretty much Capcom put a lot of games on them because they were pretty much arcade perfect.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
But it was a really, really good system, good computer system.

55:38.000 --> 55:47.000
So it was based off of the original Castlevania, which in return was also almost simultaneously released as the MSX2's Vampire Killer.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
So they were all kind of the same game.

55:50.000 --> 55:56.000
But it had a new engine that was designed to take full advantage of the Sharp X68000 software.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
It was completely updated and all the stages were re-designed.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Brand new stages included.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
All the special items, sub-weapons.

56:04.000 --> 56:10.000
A rare item called the Laurel, which fills six health blocks for ten hearts.

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
And it also was really fucking hard.

56:14.000 --> 56:20.000
I've played an emulated version of it. It was pretty hard.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
You also have the hidden items, the different one-ups, all kinds of stuff in it.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
It's a Castlevania game.

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
But it also did get harder the more you played it too.

56:32.000 --> 56:43.000
It even had, you know, different things going on with it when the later editions came out with the Castlevania Chronicles included more goodies in it.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
But I'm still focusing on the original.

56:45.000 --> 56:50.000
So the musical of the X68000 also had new arrangements for a lot of the music.

56:50.000 --> 56:58.000
Because one of the advantages that the X68000 had is that you could choose different sound modules.

56:58.000 --> 57:05.000
So you could use the FM synthesizer, a MIDI roll in LA, and you could also use a MIDI roll in GS.

57:05.000 --> 57:12.000
So it also had a hidden general MIDI module that was of course not in the re-release of Castlevania Chronicles.

57:12.000 --> 57:19.000
And so the instrumentation would vary depending on which of the sound modules that you would use with it.

57:19.000 --> 57:26.000
And I mean, it was just a really great game. Very fucking difficult.

57:26.000 --> 57:34.000
But of course, it did get re-released all over the world later on as Castlevania Chronicles.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
And it did include some other stuff.

57:36.000 --> 57:52.000
Although in the Japanese version, unlike the English versions, the hardware selection screen would appear automatically when you played in original mode the same way it did on Akuma Joe Dracula for X68000.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
You have to use a special code to get it on the American ones.

57:55.000 --> 58:06.000
But it was, I mean, I was very happy that the game did get a re-release eventually because the X68000, I mean, it was number one only out in Japan.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
Even getting one of those systems is super expensive.

58:09.000 --> 58:16.000
And, you know, on top of it, it's just a really awesome game.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
You know, one that a lot of people missed out on.

58:18.000 --> 58:23.000
So is Castlevania Chronicles that different, or is it like, if I play Castlevania Chronicles, I'm pretty much playing?

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
Castlevania Chronicles does have the original version in it.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
It also does have an arranged and updated version.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
Oh, okay.

58:30.000 --> 58:39.000
And I'm actually really sad because it needed more information for the original release of it, and sadly my normal resource doesn't have everything I needed.

58:39.000 --> 58:46.000
But, because the Castlevania Chronicles is actually a full port, but it also did add some other features and an arranged mode.

58:47.000 --> 58:57.000
But it's, just playing the original version of it, you'd get a really strong appreciation for just what a good, solid Castlevania game is.

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
And I feel like there's a lot in here too that is influenced back and forth.

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
Like the stage two that they're playing now, this looks very similar to a stage in Super Castlevania.

59:06.000 --> 59:14.000
Like there's, I mean, obviously like every Castlevania game that was a side-scroller kind of has that same first stage with the white walls where you fight the bat at the end.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
The first going into the castle.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
Yeah, you get a lot of deviation in the games after that.

59:20.000 --> 59:28.000
And like I noticed the stage two, the underground stage, there's a stage very similar to this in, complete with the falling rocks and everything that was in Super Castlevania IV.

59:28.000 --> 59:34.000
So it's kind of interesting, you see, when Super Castlevania IV would have been around that same era, right?

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Super Nintendo was what, 91, 92?

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Yeah, this is 93.

59:37.000 --> 59:42.000
Yeah, so clearly there's stuff that influenced each other in it. So just kind of neat.

59:42.000 --> 59:47.000
I'm checking the Castlevania realm, which is another site they get a lot of Castlevania information from.

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
But this just has the character list on it. We play as Simon Belmont.

59:53.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And I'm trying to get the producer and composer information on this one because the remake was produced by Igarashi.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
But yeah, I'm not finding what I need on this one.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Sadly, and this is also what I get for thinking of it on the way here, but I mean the game when it came out, you want to know how big the game was?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
2.4 megabytes.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Jeez.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Right?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000
That's nothing by today's standards, but then again also like Atari 2600 games were 4 kilobytes.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Here we go. Here's an interview with the developer. And that was Ueda Hideo of Konami was the developer of it.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And I love the box art for it. The original artwork has like the kind of western style artwork. You know how you got the behind the head view of Simon?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
This is like the front view with the whip going out.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:04.000
So the artwork is really awesome. This is actually a pretty good article. I read it a while back.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:12.000
But it was talking about how they wanted to take advantage of the new stuff the X68000 could do to put out the game that they originally wanted to make.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And so it's just really awesome. And it also does offer differences for the other versions of the Sharp X systems.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Like the X68030 has a few other, has smoother animation in it for example.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:37.000
So they actually put it out to where it would run fluidly on the multiple Sharp systems. So it's pretty neat.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Cool. There it is. Your classic game of the week. Akumajo Dracula for the X68000. But most of you probably just know it as Castlevania Chronicles.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Yeah and if you're playing Castlevania Chronicles you just should play Dracula X anyway.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Alright. There it is. Your classic game of the week. Thank you Darcy. I can never resist a good Castlevania game.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
We've had a lot of them as classic games of the week but that's because they're all pretty good.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Yeah and the other one I picked that we had already done.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I know you're getting to that point. I'll just say when you sent me the text you said Salamander for the other one.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I was like did you know? That was episode 350. That means that was over 400 episodes ago that you picked that game.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
But how are you going to remember that far back? Thank god we have the wiki.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And I was picking a game without the wiki to rely on.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I was quite literally in my car about to leave work and I was like oh here's a game. I don't think I've done this one.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I know I've done some of the others but I don't think I've done this one.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
But thankfully they keep putting new ones out.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I'm just going to start doing classic pinball.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
With our little 10 year rule more and more games become eligible.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Yeah I already got one for my next pick that I'm going to do.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Oh good. I have to think about that.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Whenever that is.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Usually it's easy for me because I just picked something from the Commodore 64 because she doesn't have that same attachment that I do.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
You know what I played the most of on the Commodore 64? Centipede.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Okay good. Me too.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I want that fucking C64 Mini. In fact I need to see if they're up.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I know backers of their little whatever they did to Kickstarter or something.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
We're getting those because somebody either posted on our Discord.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Shout out to the VoG Network Discord.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
VoGnetwork.com slash Discord.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Somebody either posted there or on my Facebook. I don't remember where.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
But Ashley is showing that the Mini is going out and it's getting reviews.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I fucking want one. They're awesome.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I tried to find you a real one.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Aww.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I tried.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
My dad has one. He's tried to give it to me but it's been out in the garage for I don't know how long. It's not going to work.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Actually, Dan fixed my ColecoVision.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Really?

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000
And he just took it apart, cleaned it up, did some new soldering to it.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Works great.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Maybe it will work. We'll see.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
As long as the CRT works the components can be fixed.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And you can add your own games to it.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Yeah, that's true. Well, with the Minis I think you can do that too.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
So yeah, the Minis, the nice thing about the Minis is they have HDMI's.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
So it's easier in that regard.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I'm still wanting a Vectrex.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I'd love to add a Vectrex to that.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Had one, wasn't worth it.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Alright, let's before we go over to the rest of the news from this week from Loki,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
why don't we travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I don't know if you're ready for that, Loki.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Yeah, I've only got one so it should be easy.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
So this week we've got a game called Penny Punching Princess on the Nintendo Switch and Vita.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
That sounds amazing.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Sounds pretty amazing. What are you doing Penny Punching Princess?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I have no idea.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
You punch pennies?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Or do you punch the princess?

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
That's not okay though.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
She's a cheapskate.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Unless she's into that.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
So that sadly, that's all we've got.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Wow.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I've only got two in the UK.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
April is usually a pretty light month.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Japan's looking a little slow too.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I was going to say traveling over to Japan.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Watch Dogs 2 gets a price reduction on the Playstation 4.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
So there's that.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
And then you go over to the Nintendo Switch.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
The Phantasy Star Online 2 Cloud.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
That is out on April 4th.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
So that's pretty exciting.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Why do we not have this?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Don't fucking get me started.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I'm so pressed about this.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
You could make a panini.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I am so pressed.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
That's really it though.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Yeah, it's a very big game.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
But I had to look up this penny punching princess thing.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
And it looks like these little princesses have these big iron fists.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And they punch monsters and coins fall out.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Oh, coins.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Yeah.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
And then there's a calculator involved somehow I would assume.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
With all the pennies that you're collecting.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
So there you go.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Anyway, what about you Dark Soccer with Europe?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Two things.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Time Carnage on April 6th and The American Dream on April 6th.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Which looks like a bunch of violent Americans in the 50s with guns.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
So that's it.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Alright.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Let's do a few more.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
By the way, we're going to roll our mailbag over to next week.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
So we'll be answering your emails live.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us an email for next week.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
But we do have a few more news stories from Loki.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Yeah, we can talk about some quick stuff.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000
So the PlayStation VR bundle got a price drop this week.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I saw that.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
$100 cheaper now.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I might finally have to jump in on that.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
So you can get like the camera and everything.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I already have the camera.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I think though it's separate though.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I think you can get it without the camera and stuff and it's like $239.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
So I don't know.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I'd have to check.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
But I still need the move.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Well I guess you don't need it.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
You probably want it.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
They sell them in like two packs though.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I think you can probably buy them at GameStop and stuff.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000
In fact I was just checking right now to see how much they have like the PlayStation VR listed here.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
If they got the standalone stuff or not.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I'm tempted. We'll see. We'll see.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
But I might be buying some computer parts.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Like you know I've been looking at the show computer.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000
It's not so much because I've actually been talking to somebody about some upgrades for this.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
But I'm looking at a complete sound overhaul.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Standalone suggests the headset itself $199.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Oh, that's tempting.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
And then if you want like.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I think that might be.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Is that like. I can't.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Is that new.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
That is new.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Yeah. Brand new. So $199.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
OK.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Then you probably pick up a move for like $50.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And then the move. I think the move controllers.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I think they're like $50 or $60 bucks for two of them.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
It's really inexpensive.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
OK. Here we go.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Just sorry I'm bringing something.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.000
While I'm doing that while that page is loading though I did want to say also PlayStation Plus.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
They've announced what the games are going to be for April.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
And it looks pretty awesome.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
So the one big game that they got Mad Max is going to be free.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
OK. Which is a pretty awesome game.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Also Trackmania Turbo if you don't have that yet which unfortunately I do.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:06.000
And then also looks like I think this is one of the last months that we're going to get PlayStation 3 and Vita games.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
But in Space we brawl for PS3 Toy Home on PS3.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Ninety nine VITAs.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I think it's VITAs.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
On the Vita.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And Qbert reloaded on the Vita.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
It's also it's also cross by with PlayStation.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
That game is fucking terrible.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Just so you know.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
But it's free.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
It isn't even worth free.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Mad Max is worth free.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So definitely check out Mad Max if you guys get chance.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And then let's see.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
So did this page load.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
No it didn't.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Because GameStop's page fucking sucks.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Whatever.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
All right. It's fine. It's not a big deal.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
All right.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Any more stories.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Yeah.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I've got like tons of shit pulled up.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
So let's.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
This is something they'll be interested in.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Luminous Remastered.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
For Switch.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Oh yes. Yes I did.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Thank you for bringing this up.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I did hear about this because it was part of the Nindies thing that they did.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Yeah.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
While we were gone.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
That was two weeks ago I think.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
But it's fine.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Whatever.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
But we should talk about it.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Yes.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
So Luminous Remastered.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I'm so about.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Well it's not just on Switch.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I mean I'll probably get it there.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Yeah.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
It's Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Yeah.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
But how would I not get it on Switch.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Exactly.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
With the ability to do portable just like the old school one and you know dock it as

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
well.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Like it's.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
It's.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
It's hard now.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
The Switch makes a really compelling argument when it's like the same price.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
And it's portable on that system.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
You know versus PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
As much as I love some of my games on those systems.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
So.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Yeah.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And here's some of the things that they have in there.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
So they've got you know new skins.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
They had two new levels.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
40 skins as well.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Different modes.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
HD rumble effects.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
So you can you know feel different stuff like that.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And of course trans vibration.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Yay.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And you could do it with like up to like 10 Switch controllers or something crazy like

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
that.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I didn't.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Yeah.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I don't see how many.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
But yeah it's.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Yeah.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Like multiple Switch.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
You could.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
And I was like where would you put all those controllers.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Don't answer that.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
What are you talking about.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Remember dark soccer.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Ain't as thing as possible.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I can't even.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
How old are we.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
12.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
All right.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Almost 16.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Speaking of games coming to different systems.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
The game that I don't know if anybody is really asking for this to come to the system but

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
it is anyways.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
No Man's Sky coming the Xbox One.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
At least you get it when it's better than it was when it launched.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
You know.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
You know they.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Bless their hearts for still working on that game.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And they've still working on the game.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
This is going to have you know all the features and all the release you know updates that

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
they've done so far.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000
And they're working on something called next No Man's Sky next which is their next step

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
and they're teasing it hard and they're not really seeing what it is teasing would be

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
excited.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Yes.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
They're teasing it.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
They're going to claim the moon you know but I don't know.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
It's all right.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
It's not it's not a terrible game to pick up but at least it's better than what I would

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000
only buy it on Xbox One depending on the price and depending on I mean if you already have

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
it on PC or PlayStation 4 I don't understand why you would want to get it on Xbox One.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
But I know some people out there are you know exclusively Microsoft in their house you know

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
and that's that's fine.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
So this is a chance for them to get on board.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000
But you know again if the game's like twenty nine ninety nine you know like they've done a

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
lot of updates to it.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
It's not the same game that people wrote off when it first came out.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
So it's worth a look I think.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Yeah I mean I don't know what you're into if you're into the Minecraft.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I think it's that game is more like Minecraft than anything else.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I mean you don't build so much with the exploration and a lot of that same sensation.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I don't know at least that's what I get out of it.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
But you know what if you want something like Minecraft you could play Minecraft.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
You could.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I don't know I I think people are really harsh on no man's sky and I understand why but I

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
think a lot's changed in the past couple of years.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.000
And if you haven't checked it out in a while it's worth looking at again.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And then to go along with that you know VR discount they just did the VR update for wipeout.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
That's pretty close.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Oh yeah it's pretty close.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
You know if zero that's the closest thing I'll get to have zero.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
That seems like who that seems like that would almost be like like headache inducing that moving

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
that fast.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
It would definitely be something.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Yeah I want to check that out kinda.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
You're making a case I almost like God.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I just I need more shit in my living room.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
It's fun for a while.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I know I know I know.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Wipeout is only best with an edgy con.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Well you can't get that on the PlayStation 4 I'm sorry to say.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Yeah so the PlayStation 4 is highly inferior.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.000
And then I guess I guess I can talk about one more thing and that's Duke Nukem the movie happening.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
John Cena is Duke Nukem.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
OK I would watch it.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
To see John Cena is Duke Nukem.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Whatever.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Whatever.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
It's my bar for Duke Nukem the movie.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
So low.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I mean it just can't get any lower after you know Duke Nukem forever.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.000
So there is no way I can be disappointed by John Cena in a Duke Nukem movie.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
It's impossible.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I mean who else would you cast right.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I guess it makes sense.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
He does look the part.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
He does have the square head.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And he has to do the hand in his face so that we know it's John Cena.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
He's doing that whole pro wrestling to acting thing just like The Rock did.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
It's hilarious.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
He's like he's in the woods.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
It's like there's like OK.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
He's in that new movie The Cockblockers.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Yeah exactly.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
He's so charismatic.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
That movie Blockers or whatever which is probably a garbage movie.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I saw John Cena and I'm like I probably would watch that.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
You know it's like he has got the charisma.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
It's like what.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
What are you going to do.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I mean it's probably an absolute shit movie.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
But does he have the uniqueness nerve and talent.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I don't know.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I think that one sailed.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
I try I try Jamie I tried.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
All right.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
So is that it for news for tonight.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Yeah sure why not.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
All right.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Well it is a shorter news.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Oh you got one more.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
No I've just been reading.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I finished a World of Warcraft novel.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Oh one of the Christie Golden books.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Yeah because I really love her writing.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And I was really pissed because I actually want more newer stuff and there aren't any newer books.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Which which book.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I finished war crimes.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
OK.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:42.000
And it was honestly because you keep in mind I didn't finish the pandaria stuff.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
So it was actually kind of cool and I thought it was a really well-written book.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I really enjoy reading what she writes.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:53.000
So and I want more and I'm kind of pissed off that there wasn't more because I wasn't interested in anything else.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Because the only book that came out after that was the Illidan novel and it was more of a backtracking.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
It was a good book.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Right.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
But I want more like current stuff.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
OK. So one quick thing I was going to mention.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
So they did.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
There's some news regarding blood stain.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000
So they are talking about that they're never going to be announcing a release window pretty soon.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000
But they did announce their US or the English voice cast for it.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.000
So let's see they've got Erica Lindbeck for the character Miriam.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000
And she was like persona five League of Legends Street Fighter five.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000
This guy you might recognize his name as the character Zangetsu David Hayter.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Hey.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Then you've got Ray Chase who does Gebel I guess.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And he was in Final Fantasy 15 as Noctis and Nier Automata.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Also looks like Ben Diskin who's that Jonas.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:01.000
He was in looks like Halo 4 as Jared Miller and some of the Naruto games.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
The coach man Fred.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Tap this gory and he's a soldier 76 in Overwatch.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Also a sarin artists in Mass Effect I guess.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Sirens are as my friend calls them saran wrap.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Freda Wolf who's Dominique.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000
She's in Mass Effect Andromeda Sarah Ryder and I didn't know there were this many characters in blood stain.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Yeah Gremory Carrie Walgreen.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000
She was in No More Heroes.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Also we've got Ann Arena Strober who's in Persona and Fire Emblem.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Who else Christopher Swindle.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I'm trying to see if there's any other recognizable names I see.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.000
There's only two more here Robbie Belgrade who's in Castlevania Symphony at night as Alucard.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
And he's also the announcer for Tekken so I mean that's kind of cool.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Oh wow I didn't know that.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And then finally we've got let's see Jamie Mortell.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I'm going to butcher his last name.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Mortellero and he's the director for the voice acting.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
He did Silent Hill Shattered Memories Halo 4 and EverQuest 2.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Well I'm excited I'll finally get my Kickstarter pledge to get that free copy of Bloodstained.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Yeah they said there's going to be a beta backer demo that's going to be available June 2018 and announcing the release of the game.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
So finally this year it sounds like.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Maybe.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Exciting.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Exciting times.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Alright well that is about going to do it for another episode of Orange Daunt Radio.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I know it was short this week but that's because we're a little unplugged a little off the record this week.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
But we wanted to give you something to hold you over while we're on a little bit of a live break.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:59.000
But we will be back live April the 8th with the next episode of our show and a full length show with your calls with your emails and with you in our chat at live.vog.net.com.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.000
But as I do say at the end of every episode if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Daunt Radio please help us spread the word.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice but only if the voices are here to participate.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
So a nice five star review on iTunes goes a long way or Google Play or wherever it is you found this show.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And then of course tell a friend or two that all helps that word of mouth is so so important.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
And I think on that note it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Dark Sakura enjoy the movie tonight.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
What's your final thought.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Yeah we're going to go see Pacific Rim 2 just because giant robots and kaiju.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
And John Boyega is in it right.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Yeah the only thing that makes me a little bit iffy about it is because it's not done by Del Toro.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
The last movie was so good.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I really think they should have been the Mako Mori movie but you know whatever.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I hear it's stupid but I also hear it's really action packed and awesome.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
It's fun.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I mean but that was the first one too.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Get some popcorn.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
The first one had Ron Perlman in it and I love anything.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I haven't actually seen the Hellboy movies which I want to.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
But I love Ron Perlman.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I want to see the new one with the guy from Stranger Things.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000
He's like eh different guy than Ron Perlman I'm not sure if I can get on board with that.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
And I was like OK I can get on board with that.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I didn't even know there was a new one but.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Yeah they're rebooting it.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Of course they're rebooting every fucking thing.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Of course.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Today was the 30th anniversary of Beetlejuice and they're talking about Beetlejuice 2 and.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
No.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
No.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
No.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
No they are talking about it I'm just saying no.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
No.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
But then they also.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
The only one I'm interested in is Sheetaljuice.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Because that was Bianca Del Rio.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Right.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
All right.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000

Double digits.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Just thinking about it.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Internally.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Loki.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Last but not least.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Go see Ready Player One.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
