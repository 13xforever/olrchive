This week Microsoft's continued expansion of their avatar system was inadvertently leaked revealing changes allowing a more detailed embodiment of yourself or a person of your own design. That's just one story to come. Join us for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio prepped for takeoff tonight on episode 727 of our show. For tonight, April the 22nd of 2018, my name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio every week, every single stinking week except the week she doesn't say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hi, how are you?

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm alive.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Good. I'm glad to hear that. You were telling me a little bit about you had a spa day yesterday with one of our lady friends from the DDR days.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes. People from those days may know her as DNL Dreams. It was Renee. I met up at her house and we went into San Francisco and went to the Pearl Spa in Japantown. It's a Korean run business and I don't know too much about bathroom rituals for Korea so I don't know if it's the same thing.

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But it felt very like a Japanese bath to me where you go and you sit and you clean first and then you can have a hot tub or a cold tub. And so it was really nice. Lots of good soaking. They had a sauna, which I'm not too fond of saunas, and a steam room that was out of order.

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But then upstairs they had two other sauna rooms that had like a clay bed that you lay in, like clay balls, red clay balls, and a Himalayan salt room. And they did sheet masks. And I was like, oh, sheet masks. And they gave me two, which I brought for your significant other.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, there you go.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And because I have a bunch. And then I had like a full body exfoliating scrub. I got over any body shyness I had really quick because you do go in there naked. It's very like that.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay. But like women go to the bathroom together, so whatever.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It was scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, all the scrubbing, hot water. And the hot water felt great, but it was surprisingly hot just to have it splashed on me. And like just tons of skin came off. And now I've got baby skin. I keep petting my arm because I don't know who this is anymore.

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And like almost all my calluses are gone. It's amazing.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That actually sounds fun. I would do something like that. Now, not to like give away my home address on air, but a somewhat reasonable distance here from OLR headquarters. There used to be a men's only Korean spa, like not that far from here.

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This was women's only.

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Right. So but this men's only one. I have I am aware that some CD. It is not just.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's that kind of bathhouse.

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, it's like the one in Berkeley.

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's not just like massage.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I've learned a lot about bathhouses lately.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah. Yeah. So and no, I don't know this firsthand. You pervs. I just I've heard things. There was a bathroom stalls.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
There was supposed to be a cento like a Japanese style full bath, you know, split men and women's just outside of Sacramento.

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And I think it closed down because it was when I was looking for places because it's like, where am I going to find outside of San Francisco or that infamous male bathhouse in Berkeley?

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's basically hookup bathhouse?

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I didn't even tell you the punchline of this whole thing.

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No, it's fine. The the the thing closed. It's gone.

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And in its place is the same name, Burger and Shake.

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So it's like the family must have decided, maybe this business.

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So but now it's going to be Burger and Shake.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So I can just see one of these days, Loki's going to bring a bill bag, a burger and shakes in this place.

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And maybe like, do you know what used to happen there?

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, it still happens there, too.

34
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So you get your burger and your shake on.

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Burger and shake wink.

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How are you doing, Techmaster Loki?

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm doing fine.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Good, good. Full of breadsticks, I see.

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Full of breadsticks.

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Good. A very breakfast of champions and dinner, too.

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yep. All three meals, pretty much.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah. How's how's your week been?

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I saw I saw some pictures on the old book of faces over at Old Town.

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So you must have taken the fam out for a play day.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah. The kids wanted to go on the light rail to Old Sacramento, to the railroad museum.

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Sadly, we got to light rail station right as the light rail came and we missed it.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So we just drove down there anyways, which is probably better anyways.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Who wants to sell light rail train for 30 minutes?

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Especially with the kids.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
They wanted to because they thought it'd be exciting.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But we instead we went on like the steam train that they have there.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh, that's cool.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Had dinner and I played lots of Pokemon Go and even on the steam train, which is great because it doesn't go very fast.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I hit all the focus apps along the way.

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Brilliant. Brilliant.

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Did you did you see that shop that has the classic arcade games in the back?

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No.

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, it's not far from where those trains are.

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There's a little there's a shop and it's like a it's like a kitsch, knickknack type of shop.

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But in the back, they have a bunch of like 80s arcade games.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
They want like 50 cents a play, though, to play shit like Defender and Joust.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And they have them. There's like the second candy.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So there's like the candy heaven, which is like there's like four candy barrel stores and there's like two sock stores.

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Like who who gets them? Like who shops for socks?

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Alan. Alan loves fun socks. Yeah.

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Jamie, I thought this was the thing you'd like to.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I really like socks, but they have to be well-made socks.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So I won't buy funny socks if they're not well-made.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I do. I do like I like cute socks and I don't care how they're made.

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
J.D., who comes on the show once in a while, he's in our chat now and he'll be here next week.

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He got me this really cute pair of Jigglypuff socks.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So, you know, for when I play Pokemon Go.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And when I was at the mall not that long ago, I got Bob Ross socks.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They're super cute. So, OK, well, apparently everybody's more in the socks than I was aware.

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But anyways, so they used to have like I remember that because we were walking by some of the stores and like,

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
oh, yeah, that's where the Nickel Arcade used to be.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But like I remember that second candy store and I know there's probably dozens of other ones,

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
but the second one that's kind of in the corner there,

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
they had like classic arcade games in the back too at the time.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh, that's random.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But they don't anymore and no one's in there because, you know, everyone's at the other candy store, which is way better.

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh, poor guys. All right.

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I do want to say hello to our chat room where we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network,

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
vog network dot com at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But a programming note, Bobby, he was here tonight.

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He's going to be gone for the next couple of weeks, but we will still be here.

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We don't have any shows off till the end of June.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So we'll be here for the next few weeks, again, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And if you are listening live, you can join us in our chat room at live dot vog network dot com.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
All those chat issues from last week, they were resolved in the middle of the week.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Essentially, it was explained to me the same way it was explained that the Oculus Rift,

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
remember when their website just kind of stopped because the security certificate was bad?

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's kind of what happened to our chat last week.

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So there was nothing we could do about it during the show.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But the issue magically fixed itself in the middle of the week.

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Bobby as a fail safe also put some other like alternative links there if that happens again.

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So sorry about last week, guys, but shit happens.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So well, but we made it through a show last week.

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It was a fun show last week.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And it'll be a fun show tonight, too, with more folks in our chat over at live dot vog network dot com.

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And Bobby Black Wolf actually starts us off.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He sends a link.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But he said, did somebody say gaming socks and pointed out these are the socks I wore at my wedding?

104
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And they're actually Katamari Damacy socks, which to go with the cake that Bobby had at his wedding.

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
See, see now, Loki, can you see why we like socks when it's things like this, like the king of all cosmos?

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I do, though.

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I tell you, I find cute socks at Daiso sometimes and I will buy them because they're pile socks,

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
not just a tweet, you know, to give Daiso some business because Daiso is big and all over the world.

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But their socks are really well made and I ruin socks.

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
These I've had for a year and they're still not ruined.

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
My stripey socks from Daiso.

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Bobby wants to clarify in chat.

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He didn't know about the cake and the socks were a gift from the best man.

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So the best man was in on this thing.

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Maybe. Or it's all just a wonderful coincidence.

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So it works. It works.

117
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Sia Tabiri in our chat also points out that socks was the number one Clinton kitty.

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, yeah, but socks ended up being given away when they got a dog.

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh, I forgot about that.

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah. And the ladies had socks until until socks died.

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But we need another president with a cat instead of, you know, this anti-Semitic tweeting shithole that we have.

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I should be president if for no other reason than Mr. Smoosh could be first cat.

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I mean, well, I should be president.

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, you well, I should be president.

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Well, I'm actually of legal age to be president.

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So am I. So, yeah, you did.

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes. Yes. Look, Jamie lies to people.

128
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Why would you vote for her?

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We should co-preside. We'll just take turns.

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You can be. Well, you're more qualified than the current secretary of education.

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So why don't you try to roll through?

132
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I actually went to public school.

133
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
All right. Anyway, it's not a politics show. It's a gaming show.

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's get into some gaming news. Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, boy. Get your tea, because this is going to be a rough patch.

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Hey, let's talk about Mass Effect Andromeda, dark soccer.

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Why don't we talk a little bit about that and drama.

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah. And with it, shall I begin my my bitter tears?

139
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Hold hold them for a minute, because just in case some folks weren't aware, there was a blog that was posted this week by the general manager of Bioware, Casey Hudson, who is the what?

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He's the on again off again employee over Bioware. He's on right now.

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And he mentioned in this blog post Mass Effect Andromeda wasn't going to be getting DLC.

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We already knew that. But he talked about kind of like what went on behind the scenes, that it was kind of like shocking to them, I guess, because they mentioned, you know, we all know the Korean arc was the thing that was going to happen supposedly at one point in the story.

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
They're satisfying this through a book or something now, a comic book. I don't know.

144
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I stopped caring because I'm so mad about it.

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But anyway, Casey Hudson in the blog post called this a defining moment for Bioware.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So the moment they found out they weren't going to do DLC that EA, I guess, had pretty much pulled the plug on Mass Effect Andromeda, which was their own fucking fault to begin with.

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But anyway, they decided that they weren't going to do the DLC and Bioware called this a defining moment.

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So we need to delight players with new experiences and innovations, says Hudson, but we must stay focused on the importance of our world, character and storytelling elements that players expect from our games.

149
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And our games must be designed to continue delivering new stories and experiences in an ongoing relationship with players within the worlds we're evolving together.

150
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So he mentioned about Anthem, the world, story and character will be available to experience in co-op in an ongoing series of adventures.

151
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Anthem will be unlike anything you've played, but if we do it right, it will be very distinctively Bioware.

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And I'm at the point where this game can go fuck itself.

153
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And I hate to say that because I know there are lots of people that are working very hard on this game.

154
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And this is not about any of those programmers or any of those people that are just trying to make a living and do a job.

155
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And I feel very, very bad that I'm having to talk so negatively about Anthem.

156
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The fault is not with you guys. It is very clear it is at the executive level. It always has been.

157
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And it's at a level where it's EA's fucking fault.

158
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And I don't care about Anthem.

159
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Bioware, I'm not sure Bioware realizes how badly they've alienated people with this whole debacle.

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And the people that they want to be supporting Anthem, a lot of the people that have supported Dragon Age and Mass Effect.

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And to be all like, well, since the DLC model or whatever didn't work, we're going to have to go to co-op, co-op, co-op.

162
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Games as a service, herpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderp

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,600
violence that's happened in some of the previous series and kind of like some of

164
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,880
the ethical questions about that stuff apparently God of War is kind of this new

165
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,040
ones chewing on it kind of makes me go shit I think I might I think I might pick

166
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,120
this up like I kind of want to play this new God of War game the more and more I

167
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,920
hear about it the more I see about it so don't fucking sit there and tell me EA

168
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,160
Bioware that there's no room for single-player experiences like like

169
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,120
continue to show me that you're continuing to make bad decisions Bioware

170
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,200
Bioware is gonna be gone in the next couple years you're not gonna get a new

171
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,840
dragon yeah they're they're the next company on the chopping block that EA is

172
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,960
gonna absorb in and just destroy I hate I hate saying this I hate being negative

173
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,800
you know I am NOT negative when it comes to games but it's these fucking

174
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,020
decisions that happen at such a high level that made me so angry and I would

175
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,760
guess a lot of the things that make us you know angry gamers and stuff is

176
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,540
usually the fault of some type of executive decision hell a lot of the

177
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,540
stuff that usually even Loki gets on his horse with Nintendo about it's

178
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,140
usually some type of decision at the very very top gotta keep those

179
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,860
shareholders happy we're angry when we love it Jamie I know you want to spill

180
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,020
some tea what was what was your reaction to hearing all this fuck them I've been

181
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,380
fuck them since anthem was announced but why I mean like because remember there's

182
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,540
gonna be people listening to this that are like olr they're just more angry

183
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,460
jaded angry I thought it looked cool I thought anthem look cool but then again

184
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:37,100
I know it looks cool it's all the bullshit that's in the back end that is

185
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,940
gonna drive me away from it right it's just that I really was into Mass Effect

186
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,780
Andromeda story I really enjoyed it I want to find out what happened to the

187
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,580
quarry ins I want it in without reading a book about I love books mind you and

188
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,200
I'll probably read the book but I wanted more and there was an even now knowing

189
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,420
there was more and they're not giving it to us fuck them all over this fucking

190
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,340
stupid piece of shit game that they don't think they think they know what we

191
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,620
want without fucking asking us what the fuck we want that's bingo that that's it

192
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,700
there's the tea right there they think they know what we want without asking us

193
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,340
what we want so fuck them that's and that's what I fucking need EA to do here

194
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:24,580
I need EA to come out and take some fucking accountability EA not Bioware

195
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,220
don't fucking send Casey Hudson to do it EA you come out and take some

196
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,460
accountability for why Mass Effect Andromeda flocked it in flock because of

197
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,660
the flop because the fans it flop because of you they never will look at

198
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,780
Star Wars they're never gonna do that it's never ever gonna happen so that's

199
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,560
why anthem can go fuck itself I already why I'm angry I'm ready to start like a

200
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,180
boycott EA hashtag well I mean I'm ready to have been there yeah no offense but

201
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,740
been there done that but it does bring attention to it and if people put in

202
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,580
there why you know or boycott anthem may you maybe instead of using the word

203
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,020
boycott because I don't think that's what this is I'm not boycotting anthem

204
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:14,100
I'm I don't not buying it I don't pre-order this I I'm trying to think of

205
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,540
something but it's something like I no longer hmm I'm trying to think of

206
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,140
something that's not so like that's more real like we use no it's not even it's

207
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:27,660
like I I'm done with Bioware because or I or no it's more EA it's not even

208
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,660
about done with EA done with EA yeah that's it I'm starting I did I thought

209
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,500
somebody said in chat yeah done with EA because you know and what this is it's

210
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,700
not a boycott it's just like I'm I'm done I'm done well and I'll be honest I

211
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:51,540
don't think I've played an EA game in how long a while what was like my first

212
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:58,740
act as president will be well be here's I mean I don't know anyway going to chat

213
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,860
at live dot vog network comm looking at some of the comments there act Efton

214
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,380
chat says we as a consumer we also don't know what we want I'd be very curious Oh

215
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,260
active says companies think people want battle royale games so we'll be getting

216
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,100
into that later come on no Gus and chat says Rob Roberts has been wanting to

217
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,220
drag them a little bit I didn't really want to discuss this topic but it did

218
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,900
become you know news this week when you know Casey Hudson and Bioware put out

219
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,980
that statement let's see phantasm chat says I'll boycott EA by not going to

220
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:35,100
their press or at e3 I'm working that day dungeon buster and chat says Sim

221
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,940
City can never be played offline a few months later an offline patch is

222
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,980
introduced Bobby Blackwell says we say we want single-player but our actions

223
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,220
show all multiplayer and battle royale you don't see God of War being the top

224
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,780
game on twitch but as the top game I mean maybe part of the reason people

225
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,500
don't want to watch single-player stuff on twitch all the time is because they

226
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,700
don't want the story spoiled so is twitch rankings really the best way to

227
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,380
evaluate that I mean it should be just sales if this God of War game if

228
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,460
horizon's yield zero dawn are selling millions and millions of copies which I

229
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,740
don't see how I'm sure horizon zero dawn did very well yeah because Sony doesn't

230
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,820
stop talking about it they did the expansion for it good for them but also

231
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,460
we got God of War I'm sure of course this game is gonna do well how does God

232
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,100
of War not end up selling like all the other games that they've been I mean

233
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:32,420
they had until dawn they had and I know there's more in it got Detroit coming up

234
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,740
Detroit yes which is that's not a Sony it's a Sony exclusive but it's the last

235
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,780
of us okay there you go last of us yeah uncharted I mean they kind of rock the

236
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,580
single-player yeah sure they put some multiplayer in there and then I have no

237
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,780
problem with them putting multiplayer stuff in there in as well Mass Effect

238
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,540
3 was rad which is why and we're gonna get into a layer which is why when I

239
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,420
hear this oh well we're not including a certain portion of the game that makes

240
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,460
me think yeah but you're still asking me to pay $60 for your game so you're

241
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,740
telling me oh we're giving you half a game but pay us the full full money and

242
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:14,380
then some in a season pass let's see Dungeon Buster and chat kind of following

243
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,260
up on that to be fair some games are great to watch on Twitch others are just

244
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,900
damn boring unless the broadcaster is really entertaining which really isn't a

245
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,820
good judge of what people are playing though really mm-hmm you know cuz it's

246
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,300
just like you said people don't always want to see stories spoiled right you

247
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,420
know and sometimes you know you're in a single-player game and like I'll do

248
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,100
Dragon Age from time to time but I'll stop because I'm into the game you know

249
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:45,540
right it's just not it's really not a good gauge Bobby Blackwolf and chat says

250
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,140
but you watch my Sierra games and a follow-up to that yeah but I and I know

251
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,900
you're saying that a little tongue-in-cheek but you know for one the

252
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,700
Sierra games are very very very old it's like one of those things where it's like

253
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,020
spoiler alert I'm going to spoil the Star Wars series okay Darth Vader's

254
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,180
Luke's father what like you can't really spoil something that's been out for like

255
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:12,420
30 years right so the boat sinks at the end of Titanic oh my god you know so

256
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:18,740
anyway with that whole thing people watch Bobby stream because it's Bobby

257
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,860
it's like it's kind of like you said you only watch me play Ni No Kuni 2 because

258
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,820
it's me I don't think you are as into Ni No Kuni 2 sometimes the personality

259
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,780
carries it a lot further there you go and phantasm chat straight up says I

260
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,100
like to play not watch phantasm out of curiosity if you play through a

261
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,820
single-player game or any game will you maybe watch somebody play it after the

262
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,300
fact because I've done that before like I've played through a single-player game

263
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,280
like let's say Final Fantasy 15 or something and then I've gone back and

264
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,220
watched other people play it just to kind of see like how they're gonna react

265
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,820
to the story I know that was a big thing with Until Dawn I know Shane and I had a

266
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,460
conversation about this once because he was super into that game and he loved to

267
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,540
watch twitch streamers play Until Dawn because he wanted to see how they would

268
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:08,220
react to all the scares and all the you know multiple branching paths to yeah

269
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,340
that's true too for sure and dungeon buster kind of follows up on that too

270
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,500
says actually I'll admit I do like watching some RPGs that I've played

271
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,820
already just to see the reactions to certain scenes for sure and even

272
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,180
something ironically like Mass Effect sometimes they're gonna make story

273
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,420
choices that were different than what you did and so it's kind of like you get

274
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,060
to see a different side of the game like oh that's what happens if you pick

275
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,820
that option I didn't know because when I played through it it was this option you

276
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,940
know so I don't know there's there's some reasons I like to watch that stuff

277
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:47,020
but anyway I don't know at this point if EA isn't gonna put out any type of

278
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,500
apology for you know basically or accountability for what they did a Mass

279
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:57,780
Effect Andromeda which I don't expect them to do I hard pass on anthem or

280
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,980
really any big-budget EA title I'm not really ready to completely maybe write

281
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,020
off everything because I also know there's some indie things that the only

282
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,900
way they kind of get out is through the EA support like what was the unravel

283
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:15,100
that wasn't was that Ubisoft or was that EA oh yeah so I don't know I don't know

284
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,820
well they also just have that was escape plan I think it was called hmm that was

285
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:27,340
pretty good but at least as far as anthem specifically pass I'm I'm not

286
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,540
seeing past yet until I see what the game is but I have a feeling it's gonna

287
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,820
be like destiny and I will judge honestly I'm not into the whole concept

288
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,740
of destiny really I've been burned by destiny twice now so yeah I still never

289
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:51,300
it's pretty I'll give it that yeah destiny 2 is pretty anyway let's move on

290
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,340
well I swear we are positive and stuff here on a well r2 it's just that was

291
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,020
something you get y'all know when a Bioware thing came up you had to you had

292
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,460
to know what Jamie was gonna say about what I was gonna say about it yeah fuck

293
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,220
them all right I'm not going to play anthem I'm not going to look at it I'm

294
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,940
not gonna support anything having to do with anthem I will forget anthem exists

295
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,500
in my internal universe you have had it officially I'm done with EA it's okay

296
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,780
though cuz if you pre-order from GameStop I'm sure you'll get an n7 skin

297
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,340
for your whatever you're calling no that not even that offensive like that's

298
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:28,500
really offensive it is but you watch they haven't announced anything yet I

299
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,340
know I'm willing to bet that that shit is gonna know thing did lure in the mass

300
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:38,460
I will say this I did participate in the Bioware clearance sale when since

301
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,220
they're changing their storefronts mm-hmm because I finally replaced like

302
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,660
the shirt that I wore holes in mm-hmm and I did it for five bucks

303
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,700
L more chart in our chat I hope I said that right I think that's a newer name

304
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:57,020
so hi and welcome it says there are very very few games I'll fork out $60 now

305
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,860
thanks to shenanigans like Andromeda last straw kind of thing oh certainly

306
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,660
when it comes to EA and the $60 price tag you betcha I have reservations about

307
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,860
that but you know other other it other companies it really depends Blizzard

308
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,740
you know if Blizzard were to say we're gonna do an overwatch expansion it's

309
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,700
gonna be you know $49.99 or something I if they go like it's single-player I'll

310
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,460
be like I'm in your PVE or whatever I'll be I'm in you know like certain

311
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,860
companies can kind of get away with it like Blizzard you know I'm willing to

312
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,700
pay a high price tag for their games cuz is there a bad Blizzard game I don't

313
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,420
think there is so there have been some bad expansions there well and there have

314
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,140
been games I don't prefer to other games like Starcraft I don't prefer I'm not a

315
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,820
Starcraft fan and I I want to get my game playing Diablo but I still look at

316
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,180
Starcraft and I go it is a good game it's just not my game yeah it's kind of

317
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,020
like that similar thing I have a God of War and that whole series I never really

318
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,460
got into God of War doesn't mean I don't like it I just you know I am one gamer

319
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,780
with a day job that has nothing to do with OLR you know I can only play

320
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,740
somebody by the time I come home I'll be honest because most of the playing I do

321
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,620
is on my computer mm-hmm I don't want to look at a computer all day for my job

322
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:12,220
and I don't want to look at another one you know maybe I'll have a stream day

323
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,100
maybe it'll just be me fucking around and Wow I don't know there you go

324
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,620
Mega Man x400 one of my good speaking of streaming one of my streamer pals in

325
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,380
chat says that would be pretty fucking rude if they put an n7 skin and anthem

326
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,700
yes it would I'm glad I'm glad we're not a matter of time and we'll be saying it

327
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,980
told you so but I know I know all right positivity happy experiences good things

328
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,620
games are awesome or we wouldn't do this show it's this is all this other stuff

329
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,900
the video game business is what sucks sometimes but video games themselves

330
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,220
fucking awesome let's talk about some fucking awesome things we played this

331
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,900
week our soccer I'm sorry I was looking my bullet journal that's okay how was

332
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,860
your gaming week oh god I didn't really I guess play a whole lot again it's been

333
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,660
a really crazy week because I'm trying to I've got two weeks now before drag

334
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,180
con and I'm trying to get a lot of my stuff together however I had started

335
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,620
firewatch and finally I just like I'm tired of being at my computer so Dan and

336
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,420
I just watched the rest of the game because honestly it's kind of the same

337
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,700
thing and so I really I really liked firewatch and I'm probably gonna go

338
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:19,980
finish it maybe I'll stream that other than that it's been Pokemon go it's been

339
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:27,380
idol pouring it's been actually playing some some puyo puyo because I love my

340
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,500
puyo puyo and I'm kind of in the mood for puyo puyo that is fun to say it's

341
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:38,300
not puyo it's not a it's not a chicken el puyo loco puyo puyo no it's it's

342
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:49,780
puyo puyo yes just playing the general stuff like that I've got I've got drag

343
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:54,620
con to get ready for all right conventions they're hard work yeah well

344
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,740
that and I still haven't decided if I'm doing Shirley Manson styled girl drag

345
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,260
for the 90s huh or if I'm just gonna do sister face the whole time well it

346
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,620
sounds like you've managed to fit in a few games here and there so yeah I mean

347
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:10,260
I play when I can I'm also finishing up a book okay all right well let's move

348
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,140
over to Loki how was your gaming week how many and play a whole ton of stuff

349
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,860
nothing really on console just because my wife's been watching all of the shows

350
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:23,260
on TV like literally all of them so I haven't been able to play any consoles

351
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,220
and I've really man when I picked up our cry 5 I really should have gotten it on

352
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:36,380
PC but I didn't know well whatever um so I played them Pokemon go quite a bit

353
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,020
this weekend just because I was out where there's pokey stops and I was

354
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:47,700
trying to gear up basically I played a little tiny bit of ingress just in

355
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:53,260
between waiting for stuff to respond and Pokemon go and a little bit of the

356
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,580
office space game which I don't even know why I still play that fucking thing

357
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:04,660
I swear to God it's just stupid that's pretty much it sadly um wow I hate to

358
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:09,500
kind of have a slow gaming week across the board but I didn't play a lot of new

359
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,260
stuff but I still played a lot of the existing stuff still been playing um the

360
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:21,900
name is gay I can't always say the be mania 2dx but it's not 2dx yes DJ max

361
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,180
respect I've still been playing DJ max respect I'm still trying to clear all

362
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,740
the songs in six button mode so I've been playing that I've been playing a

363
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,460
little bit on Xbox actually because that is now the cons because I moved the

364
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,940
PlayStation 4 to the office so I can do more streaming from it the Xbox one is

365
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,200
now kind of my console that's hooked up to the TV and you know okay I had the

366
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,700
weirdest problem with my Xbox one for the longest time like the fan that it

367
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,420
was hooked up to it would make a lot of noise like it was very like but like

368
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:54,300
they did some recent update and like that stopped I don't know like can a can

369
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,500
a patch like change the hardware like that like well they could probably maybe

370
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,300
change the firmware kicks on could be a firmware update that's pretty cool that

371
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,820
they finally like change that cuz well my Xbox is quiet and I leave it plugged

372
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:11,460
in a lot well I mean it actually is your your fans will usually kick on when

373
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,980
you've got you know an excess of heat running on your computer if it changes

374
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:20,060
the way the heat is detected or the power management system then certainly

375
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,100
the fans wouldn't kick on so much I mean the same thing can happen like I'll use

376
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,620
a Mac for an example you've got your fans running kind of high you can do an

377
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,700
SMC reset and sometimes it will keep the fans from running like they were even

378
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,860
when my Xbox one was powered off you would still hear the power brick going

379
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:39,580
oh yeah it has to cool down yeah so it was it was so they fixed it somehow so

380
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:45,300
cool with that but let's see so stuff I've been playing though so I did

381
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,100
actually okay so here's the crazy thing you guys are gonna think this is so

382
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,060
weird I did get super I've probably played like for four hours this week one

383
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,860
game that I haven't played in a long time you ready for this especially you

384
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:02,300
Loki you ready I played a lot of minecraft this week why did you say

385
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,700
anything I would have totally played with you yeah no and it's not like it's

386
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,580
the windows 10 minecraft yeah I didn't I did not realize they've changed so much

387
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:18,220
yes so much is changing but doesn't it run so good it runs so good and plus

388
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,900
like when did they make it so that like the PC version doesn't have the manual

389
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,540
crafting anymore you just go into that big recipe book and it's just like

390
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,980
anything you want to make and you can see exactly what you need to make it not

391
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:35,060
too long ago they still have that what quality of life awesome shit is this so

392
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,140
like it kind of made me excited about minecraft again so I just started

393
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:43,540
playing now I don't think I have the best world because you know you can put

394
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,020
in a seed and you can get whatever world you want so of course the seed that I

395
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,580
used was Miss Vangie and that's the seed I used to do this world but spoiler

396
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,100
alert Miss Vangie's world kind of starts you in the middle of all these sand

397
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,740
dunes which isn't the most exciting place to start at least if I roll a

398
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,400
world named Miss Vangie and you roll a world name is all the same it's all the

399
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,400
same but you have to do like I did with a capital M capital V right if you did

400
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,060
lowercase and lowercase V to you to completely it would be completely okay

401
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,400
so maybe if you and I decide to play together we'll start on a different

402
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,040
world that's like just just Vangie or something we'll do something like that

403
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,560
yeah all right there you go you could just do Vanessa Vangie Mateo and what

404
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,960
you get or as in our chat suggest JD suggests Miss Vangie with five A's Miss

405
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:36,640
Vangie exactly okay so anyway um so yeah spoiler alert the Miss Vangie world not

406
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,240
so great so although it does seem like there's a lot of other biomes nearby

407
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,000
we're trying to get that achievement but and lots of there's lots of wildlife in

408
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,600
the starting area like finding the sheep to get the wool that was really easy

409
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,180
because I forgot like man trying to make a bed really sucks and like the thing

410
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,640
that's like the toughest thing about Minecraft I think is like try well

411
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,960
because I play in survival mode I play easy survival yeah because I want there

412
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,760
to be a point and although don't get me wrong like I love the shit I see in

413
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,120
creative mode I love how people basically use minecraft as like virtual

414
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Legos I love that stuff but like that's not for I'm not as artistic so that mode

415
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,600
doesn't speak to me as much as like survival mode where it's like there is a

416
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,080
game the game is to survive and not get killed by creepers and stuff I get more

417
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,560
thrill out of that so but the hardest part is that you have to build a house

418
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:32,000
in the first like ten minutes because if you don't then when the monsters come

419
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,720
out like they're gonna be skeletons and spiders and creepers and shit that spawn

420
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,880
right by your house but like trying to get a bed for your house that's hard

421
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,180
because you've got to find like what three pieces of wool which means you

422
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,080
have to basically kill sheep because you're not gonna get shears that fast

423
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,080
which when did they put shears in Minecraft that was something I was like

424
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,040
that's been in the since the Xbox 360 really yeah I missed the boat on that

425
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,920
somehow so anyway it's just faster just to kill them so it doesn't matter I

426
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,000
guess I guess so anyway without going on and on about a game that's years and

427
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,280
years old I've been rediscovering minecraft so if you haven't played

428
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:11,140
minecraft in like two years I would say fire it up and see what's changed cuz

429
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,920
you know it felt like kind of a new game to me in many ways so that was really

430
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,600
cool so anyway so yeah we need to we need to do a multiplayer that would be

431
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,560
really fun cuz I you it's all through the realms thing now right well realms

432
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,400
are like the servers so if you keep a serve you want like a server to keep

433
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:32,240
going huh you pay for realms and then people can log into that but it's like

434
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,280
very limited the amount of people can connect at a time but you can just do

435
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:43,960
multiplayer also okay that's cool now with the realms can I play on PC and

436
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:53,720
somebody on Xbox one can yep thing Oh Xbox one the switch phone VR oh that's

437
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,680
something we didn't have before when we had the vog server before it was all PC

438
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,320
yeah oh you making me think maybe we need to need to check out a realm for 30

439
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,640
days and see what happens okay all right all right I think I think that might be

440
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,800
a thing we do and then we play in the official vog network but I'm still using

441
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,520
Vangie as a seed well realm yeah I mean you could just do it like survival

442
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,600
okay create creative was fun but like I don't know it like it almost it like

443
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,520
defeats the point and it was fun like with mods and stuff on there but you

444
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,200
can't really do that so much anymore you can pay for like they have like skins I

445
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,280
guess you can pay for like they kind of skin up everything and change a little

446
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,640
bit of this stuff but I don't know okay Bobby and chat says wait till I get back

447
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,440
so maybe that's gonna be a thing all right in a couple weeks so all right

448
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,880
sounds good and that that gives our listeners time to prepare themselves and

449
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:52,000
go rediscover minecraft so we'll be we'll be working on that all right Bobby

450
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,320
Blackwell says I have the Xbox one version which has parity with Windows

451
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,280
10 see I had I I knew that they had like the crossplay but I didn't really I kind

452
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,400
of thought like I wonder if the realms is how they title that together so that

453
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,400
you don't have to yeah real realers anymore realms are just one of that

454
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,360
servers paying for realms basically or that you were paying for servers

455
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,000
Microsoft one of them well it's also to make it easier because you know setting

456
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,320
up a server right server is kind of it can be a little bit of a pain and they

457
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,000
still have like the PC PC version if you want to do that you know the Java

458
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,320
version if you want to still run the servers and everything but they do have

459
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,280
realms now they're a little bit better so the only people excluded are

460
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,720
PlayStation 4 and Vita from that but that's Sony's fault that's not yeah okay

461
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,360
all right well and probably the X you know obviously the older systems ps3 and

462
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:46,000
360 right because those haven't updated but like switch I think is gonna be

463
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,120
getting it soon I don't have their update yet but then there we talked about

464
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,820
last week the new updates gonna have the Xbox actually last week talking about it

465
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,840
and then seeing it on the Nintendo switch store I almost bought it on the

466
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,320
switch and I was like it's 30 bucks I was like you know I have it on PC hello

467
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,280
let me go let me go revisit it on PC so I did and that's when I started

468
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,520
discovering like when the fuck did they change all this so there's a lot I've

469
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,320
been played in months so it's like every time I go back I'm like what is all this

470
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,960
shit right it's all new anyway so I could dust off mine all right okay I've

471
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,320
also though I actually every so often like if I'm bored at work during my

472
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,160
lunch or something I'll play on my Mac okay I'll never call it out for my

473
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,800
gaming time but okay I play on a Mac all right I don't know if the Mac versions

474
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,760
the same as like the Windows 10 I don't care I just play creative anyway because

475
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,280
I dig holes all right anyway I didn't mean to turn my entire segment into a

476
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,200
Minecraft thing but hey it is it is probably the game I played more than

477
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,200
anything else this week so but I think I think I might start over on a better

478
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:53,000
seed just because yeah the Miss Vangie didn't work out so well as to see I

479
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,480
don't know if you guys if you guys you know maybe we can make it the Vangie

480
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:02,240
challenge if you want to play on Miss Vangie as a seed and tell me where the

481
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,760
fucking redstone is cuz I can barely find iron okay so it's just like getting

482
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,600
into the mines like I mean I could just dig a hole in the floor and get in the

483
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,320
mines that way but we all know that's not safe because you could dig a hole in

484
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,160
the floor and then you fall through your death right right well okay yeah you

485
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,440
could there you do it you do a gradual standing then of course now they have

486
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,160
also you know you still have the silverfish that end up in there and

487
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,600
that's a pain in the ass yeah Elmore chart in our chat says digging holes in

488
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,840
Minecraft is oddly satisfying that's that's the reward I get from it too like

489
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,800
all I've really done on Miss Vangie world right now is I've built like just

490
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,920
I did find a place to go underground that I kind of like and I've just built

491
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,520
this tunnel in wonder it's just a giant tunnel because I'm like at some point

492
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,680
I'm gonna tunnel into something good well you know what yet to happen you

493
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,440
know what my homes are like the house I had back on the old server it was this

494
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,200
underground network of tunnels like a big maze yeah and I knew how to get

495
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,760
through it but like the opening was like a glass shrine I the door I also

496
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,400
always forget like there is nothing wrong with setting up your home

497
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,560
underground you can set up an easy base underground you just have to dig

498
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,320
yourself the tiniest little hole with the door to bed and you can keep

499
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,800
yourself safe I like I tend to when I'm starting off just into the side of a

500
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,000
mountain because then oh that's smart to see I need to play smarter and do

501
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,600
something like that where I just build or if all else fails like the very

502
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,840
first times we used to play if all else fails you just run out of time you just

503
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:36,200
build a tower straight up and just wait it out I like that that's good not go go

504
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,480
underground be the dwarves were the dwarves knew something all right anyway

505
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,200
that's it for my gaming week let's get into some gaming news oh I'll quickly

506
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,000
say of course as always follow us on twitter twitter.com slash olr we're also

507
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,200
on facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and anything else I need to

508
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,280
shout out I don't think so I think we were ready to get into some news so

509
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:04,480
let's do it Loki start us off all right so as I kind of alluded to earlier do

510
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,120
you know a lot of these games are going this whole battle royale route because

511
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,800
of course that's the hot new thing right now so which two people are gonna jump

512
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,720
on the bandwagon first why of course it's gonna be the two big FPS

513
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:22,200
franchises Call of Duty in battlefield so Call of Duty the official announcement

514
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,600
hasn't come out yet they're gonna be teasing that I guess on May 17th but

515
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:33,520
from apparently people that are in the known different sources that people had

516
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,240
are saying that the game is not gonna have a single-player campaign like the

517
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,120
other games they said that there's basically gonna be focused on

518
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,120
multiplayer but they will have like some sort of zombies thing that's gonna

519
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:50,560
happen for the single-player portion and that kind of weird too because when you

520
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,920
hear that the other rumor that was out there was that modern warfare 2

521
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:02,800
remastered is not gonna have multiplayer it's like but why are you why I know why

522
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,160
because they're gonna sell that shit fucking separate later and that's still

523
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,420
you know head scratching but that's something that they're probably gonna do

524
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:16,160
I'm saying with battlefield battlefield is something that they're looking at

525
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:24,640
possibly doing like a battle royale type 4 as well so I forgot I left a game

526
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,160
out of my gaming week do you know what else I played this week

527
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,280
fortnight for night yeah I was I wasn't gonna detract from your story for no

528
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,400
reason the battle royale talk made me think I tried fortnight this week do you

529
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,340
want to hear about my experience with fortnight how's that okay so I don't

530
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,960
know I've watched people play fortnight I've watched people play pub G so I was

531
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,040
like alright well I have for tonight it's installed on my PC I think I

532
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,680
installed it I may have done a stream like early early early on or something I

533
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,040
don't remember I don't remember any of it so I was like alright I'm gonna fire

534
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,720
up fortnight let's do it and so I I set it up and I'm like where's the tutorial

535
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,280
how do I learn how to play and I'm like alright well I'm just gonna start maybe

536
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,320
it sets you in an intro level before you know I went right into a game that was

537
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,600
you know one versus 98 I'm assuming two people didn't make it so I get in there

538
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,800
and I'm like alright well I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing it's like

539
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,520
get out of the bus and I'm like how we get on man and then I'm falling slowly

540
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,560
and I'm like why are all these other people falling faster than me and oh oh

541
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,000
you have to you have to like steer it so I finally figured it out and I landed on

542
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,640
the ground and I was like in this open field and I'm like oh fuck this is a

543
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,640
terrible place to be so I'm like run to a house run to a house so I found a

544
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,600
house I found a barn or something I found a gun and then I was like oh oh

545
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,440
there's a gun up there I want I want I can't get it I'm like wait you can build

546
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,560
stairs right and so I built stairs to get the gun and I'm like okay I did it

547
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,680
I did it and then like oh shit I hear somebody okay here's the main nearby oh

548
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,400
they went in the house they went in the house I ran over the house I opened the

549
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,320
door to the house and I instantly got shotgun to death and I came in 53rd

550
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,240
place and I was like well that was a fortnight Bob what didn't you ever watch

551
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,840
battle royale of course I watched battle royale you don't run to the house you'd

552
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,560
let them come to you and that's exactly what this person did they knew I was

553
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,600
there and they waited for my stupid ass to open the door now this is fortnight

554
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,680
what you do is you build a giant platform in the sky and you snipe

555
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,400
everybody from the sky but then you're you're sitting there with your ass out

556
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,400
in the sky build you build like walls around it and stuff you gotcha fine

557
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,880
phantasm chat says newbie I didn't know what I was doing like fortnight well

558
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,320
technically yes that is the definition because he was a newbie to the game yes

559
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,720
and fortnight doesn't exactly tell you here is how you play fortnight and I was

560
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,760
like alright so trial by fucking fire I'm still happy I came in 53rd but that

561
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,920
must mean like a bunch of people probably plunged well no you know what

562
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,200
it was I stayed alive running around going how do I build this staircase to

563
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:53,200
this gut is it this button is this so as I'm sitting there being a dumbass other

564
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,120
people are getting picked off because I'm sure there's got to be areas where

565
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,000
like tons of people try to swarm it right that's got to be what happens in

566
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:07,160
for tonight just remember in every race someone comes in last place to register

567
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,160
participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at fog network calm

568
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:18,140
use the passphrase English I also watched a stream of fortnight because

569
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,520
one of my buddies from ingress is getting more and more into like game

570
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,600
streaming so he was playing fortnight from his PlayStation 4 so I watched him

571
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:32,320
and he was laughing so fucking hard because he was playing fortnight on

572
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,640
PlayStation 4 and he was in team mode I guess there's a team yeah you can do

573
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,680
teams his entire team was like 10 year old dudes and like you could hear

574
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:48,360
parents in the background all this stuff and they're and I'm like I'm like

575
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,240
sitting there with my mouth ajar going like where what what where is your

576
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,960
babysitter where and like and like did the whole time my friend Chris is just

577
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,720
sitting there like trying to be like super calm like you guys need to come

578
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,720
over to the house where are you guys right now because you're gonna get

579
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,560
sniped off it's like trying to be cool and calm and collected I'm like I would

580
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,880
not be able to handle this I would be like hilarious where it made for a

581
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,560
really funny stream which I think and this is why twitch is popular yeah

582
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,280
because it's because there is not as many screaming crazy people you know in

583
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:24,640
single-player RPGs you haven't seen me play RPGs then we need to see what

584
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,640
happens when you play fortnight dark saga that may not happen it doesn't

585
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,200
sound like something I'd enjoy it's not first-person though for what it's it's

586
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:38,160
free though it is free free if you hate it who cares you lose anything time time

587
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,760
is a precious commodity that no one will ever get back time is valuable god damn

588
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:49,800
it anyway uh let's see Bobby Blackwell says it's usually me who's last place in

589
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,320
the race see Mario Kart 8 Bobby I bet if you tried fortnight all you'd have to do

590
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,440
is hide like a little bitch and you'd come in like all right Bobby somewhere

591
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,360
someday I'll get a switch and then maybe you won't be last place or maybe it will

592
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,640
I don't know you know it would make me play a game like that if it was branded

593
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:11,120
hunter Hunger Games well I'm sure you had like all of the things in the

594
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,400
Hunger Games let's go back to Loki's story I'm sure it's coming because

595
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,120
everybody's battle royale-ing all the things now like I said I would represent

596
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,640
my district I saw this really funny meme because you know now it's the time of

597
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,360
year where everybody's doing e3 leaks e3 leaks so somebody put this meme online

598
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:31,080
that was like check out this awesome e3 leak it was a slide where everything had

599
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:35,320
like a battle royale mode right yeah this war like 100 yeah I was like Sims

600
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,400
battle royale but then the one that made me laugh really hard was that had Yoshi's

601
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,640
murder island in the corner and I was like I think I replied and I put if

602
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,100
Yoshi's murder island was a real game I would throw my Sony and Microsoft

603
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:51,360
systems in the garbage like there would be no need for them anymore I would play

604
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,520
nothing but Yoshi's murder island would you would you dark cycle would you play

605
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:02,640
Yoshi's murder island maybe see Nintendo 100 Yoshi's one survives I'm like Kirby

606
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,600
battle royale where your goal is just to eat the other curbies what were you

607
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:14,640
saying I was just gonna say you know if Nintendo was under new management you

608
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,760
know this one a really adult route I'd be down anything's possible but right

609
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,080
now it's all about labo which I know we talked a little bit about God of War at

610
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,520
the top of the show we didn't really address labo came out and there's

611
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,120
another thing that's big on twitch right now is people making their cardboard

612
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:35,800
stuff I I didn't get labo because I am still sitting here going 60 bucks for

613
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:40,640
what a cardboard piano I mean yes it looks cool but it's technically $60 it's

614
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:46,920
yeah 16 and $80 for a robot yeah like and again I'm not hating on labo like if

615
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,360
I had kids I would be buying this for my kids it's awesome but I don't I have mr.

616
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,940
smoosh and mr. smoosh would just claw at the car he would chew it yeah well

617
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,660
Midna choose cardboard would try to live in it Midna likes to eat boxes so

618
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:05,740
well you can make a house out of like the variety set yeah he can go squish

619
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,740
himself in the house yeah I think the only one of those I'd be interested in

620
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,420
it well the piano one is cool but I'd want to do the rock-em-sock-em robots

621
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,620
one because that game actually kind of looks fun yeah I mean I'm gonna wait and

622
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,160
see what happens with this whole labo thing I'm sure they'll be you know

623
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,060
especially if they start having more like third parties get in on it and it's

624
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,780
like oh we're making all these peripherals out of cardboard because the

625
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,540
little controllers are awesome and do all these things I'll be very curious

626
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,260
to see what happens with that in the future anyway let's talk about another

627
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:37,500
story that has to do with puzzle fighter you know there's a puzzle fighter iOS

628
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,260
game and I think dark soccer you've mentioned this before I know I checked

629
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,340
it out briefly I didn't really yeah I didn't really care for it it just again

630
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:48,940
you can't control on the phone the same way you can with a tangible controller

631
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,580
and that's what does it for me well apparently puzzle fighter not having a

632
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:57,220
lot of success anywhere because Capcom has announced the server will be shutting

633
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:02,860
down for the game July 31st 2018 the game will be removed from the app stores

634
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:11,340
on July 1st this game just fucking came out like not even a year ago so the

635
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:16,360
shelf life of a what do they call these games games mobile service games as a

636
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,840
service now is eight months long and eight eight months service and you guys

637
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,720
thought me Tomo was bad is me Tomo officially dead now no I'm still going

638
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,200
on and I think through me okay I've actually been kind of enjoying me Tomo

639
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:35,280
now that I have all this money no right yeah so but yeah puzzle fighter coming

640
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,000
to an end before it even really got started what made this puzzle fighter

641
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,180
different it had other Capcom characters in it not just Street Fighter and dark

642
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,980
stalkers like the original 90s puzzle fighter did which was awesome so make it

643
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:52,500
a free-to-play game put it out on a console didn't we have a story on the

644
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,620
show like two weeks ago that was like puzzle fighter got rated for switch and

645
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,580
stuff so is that just where they're gonna go with it maybe cuz it would make

646
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:04,260
a lot more sense but still if I had spent money on this game oh my god after

647
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,380
eight months they're gonna pull the plug when you spent money on it like I'd be

648
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:12,780
kind of pissed Oh Eames as a service no one ever said the service had to be good

649
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:18,660
and that's again when I hear stuff about like anthem and stuff I'm like well you

650
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,460
know now eight months is the new precedent for the minimum amount well

651
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:26,260
we look yeah look at like it was a destiny one and you know destiny to

652
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,340
eventually gonna go down to I mean it's only a matter of time with these online

653
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:35,100
games that don't have a single player is like what's the point they're gonna be

654
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:40,100
complete garbage it's gonna be as good as an AOL CD at some point do we need

655
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,420
game companies to start saying like I almost kind of want and you know Apple

656
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,820
could Apple could really push this if they wanted to because they did it with

657
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:52,140
a loot box thing remember they started saying if you're gonna put something

658
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,500
with loot boxes in our store you have to disclose that they started doing that

659
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,900
when the whole battlefront thing happened couldn't Apple say like you

660
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:05,000
need to start putting a guarantee through date a service is good through

661
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,880
XYZ date on it well this is a free-to-play game so I don't really think

662
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,480
that um usually though there are things about limited price limited sale on the

663
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,320
App Store so I think that at least anything that you'd acquire through the

664
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,280
App Store is gonna have some kind of disclaimer on it but aren't we at the

665
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,920
point where like you know game companies maybe need to start calling out oh well

666
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,160
if you're gonna drop real money or stuff on this we're gonna guarantee our

667
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,460
services are gonna be good through XYZ day I mean the only reason we all know

668
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,460
we keep playing Pokemon go and spending money on Pokemon go as we know that

669
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:40,420
game is done phenomenally well it continues to do well no matter what you

670
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,880
know you know keyboard blogger people that don't actually play the game are

671
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,100
telling you because this community day still do very well that game is gonna be

672
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,780
running for a very long time you know we know that but I'm starting to distrust

673
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,860
some of these other upcoming games what we have what we're gonna have a

674
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:59,180
Ghostbusters AR game coming out right I'll check it out that sounds fun though

675
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,220
but how long do we know it's gonna be you know like Ghostbusters if the last

676
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:08,380
Ghostbusters movie did not come out I might be all down for like anything

677
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:12,380
Ghostbusters but like it feels like Sony's just trying to milk that cow to

678
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:17,060
death and I just don't I don't want to touch anything Ghostbusters brand

679
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:22,020
anymore it's like it's ruined it for me not because of the movie the movie which

680
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:26,420
is kind of it seemed like they didn't put much effort into it's just a cop

681
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,860
reboot copy of the first one just gender swapping everything the cast

682
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,300
which I don't really care it's just no effort into it but like all the other

683
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:38,900
games associated with it have been shit that they've had a VR game that was not

684
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:44,540
good they had a non VR game that was not good so the ghost so the Ghostbusters

685
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:48,420
gaming franchise hasn't been good since the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 days

686
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:51,340
because those games were fucking fire like those games were awesome the

687
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,940
original Ghostbusters game they had also there's a game that was as I forget what

688
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:59,580
the title of the game was but there's a game that came out not it was a few

689
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:04,140
years ago which was basically the equivalent of a Ghostbusters 3 because

690
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:08,620
they had all the original cast so there was that I think that's the one dungeon

691
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,900
Buster's referring to 2009 Ghostbusters yeah so that one was good but like

692
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,140
everything else that's come after it is not so great I'll check it out because

693
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:22,780
it's probably gonna be free but yeah I don't know everybody wants a piece of

694
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:28,100
that Pokemon go money yeah much like Pokemon go battle royale there we go

695
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:33,300
I've struck it rich now but like an AR game battle royale real world like I

696
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:38,620
would be super into that like like I ingress is an intense game because it's

697
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:46,860
PvP but it's also like not actually like PvP like I can't fucking lay traps in

698
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:51,580
ingress or like do things to really like directly disable the other players like

699
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:55,180
it's not really like intensely PvP like that directly to say well we're talking

700
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:58,860
like a Tonya Harding situation oh no no because that would be unacceptable in

701
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,620
the real world but you know what I mean like what if what if there was an item

702
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,340
that you could like let's say a mine that you lay on the ground and if

703
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:08,940
another player walks over that mine they are they can't fire bursters for 30

704
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:14,380
minutes or something there's nothing turrets everywhere yeah so cuz you know

705
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:20,340
I'd be like oh yeah I know you know I wouldn't do it to my stuff I would put

706
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:23,860
it on their stuff like I'd be like I know you're at this portal every single

707
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:27,940
day so I'm gonna just put a bunch of crap we're aware of where your place of

708
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:33,020
employment is just feel free to like scatter that shit around all right

709
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:36,900
anyway let's move on to some more stories dark soccer you got a pretty big

710
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:41,100
deal story lots of people were talking about this week yeah given that I brought

711
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:46,060
up fire watch during my class not my classic game but the the games that I

712
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:51,540
was playing this one kind of actually hit me they basically the developer

713
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:59,380
campo Santo was acquired by valve it's 12 employees and the quote is they

714
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:04,260
agreed to join valve and maintain our jobs as video game developers and

715
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:10,540
continue product on our current project in the valley of the gods so yeah valve

716
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:14,660
acquired them so now we can't see valve isn't making games anymore because

717
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:18,020
they've just acquired people who are making games and in the valley of the

718
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:23,500
gods is going to be a first-person adventure set 1920s Egypt and they're

719
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:28,220
still supporting fire watch so it's pretty interesting it's actually made

720
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:36,260
from the company was developers from clay and telltale so I guess it's

721
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:44,020
something you know maybe we'll get a half-life 3 by them I don't know no no

722
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:49,500
probably not but still I mean it's good to know that I mean valve you know at

723
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,980
least sees talent in them and sees that these would be good people to add on to

724
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:58,700
their staff I mean I just hope that they'll be able to keep performing like

725
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:03,420
that be able to keep doing good games well I think the good news is that maybe

726
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:08,060
with this valve you know oversight will get a fire watch too but you will never

727
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:12,340
ever ever get a fire watch 3 so don't get your hopes up well you know if they

728
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,740
do it a fire watch 2 they should actually put a lot more animation into

729
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,500
their scenery instead of it having me so static but other than that for it being

730
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:24,380
a group of 12 people making the game it wasn't bad and did you did you play it

731
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:31,940
no I didn't I thought it was really good Rob says he loved it from the other room

732
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:38,700
but I don't know if it was an acquisition or if it was more like a

733
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:44,820
full merger it seems to me like more like it's coming off as a a adoption and

734
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:49,140
less of a full acquisition since you brought up Kirby battle royale earlier

735
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:54,620
this sounds like a curbing basically valve is inhaled them and absorb their

736
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,820
powers yes that is what's if they've been their rogue they've been correct

737
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,540
they're like they're at rogue can we can we use that for now on when a game

738
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:05,300
company gets curbied they're getting curbied okay they're sucked up and and

739
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:11,780
sometimes they could get spit out as a as you know a projectile so yeah that's

740
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:17,780
EA EA inhales them and then spits them out in a useless form well maybe but

741
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:22,140
projectiles are useful attacks in Kirby so yes if they were spit out in a

742
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:29,700
useless form it would just be like an egg like Yoshi pooping an egg no it'd

743
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:35,540
just be a shit it's just it's just a monster dump that's all anyway moving on

744
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:39,540
all right well you know this happens sometimes smaller studios get absorbed

745
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:43,100
by bigger ones it's just interesting that it's valve I think in this case you

746
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:48,060
know we just haven't heard of valve acquiring a lot of companies lately so

747
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:56,100
yay to valve making games again I guess by proxy all right moving on so since

748
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,980
we were talking about Minecraft a little bit earlier there is a situation where

749
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,980
apparently since one of the things you probably noticed Rob when you went into

750
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:06,660
the store or into Minecraft is there's a store now you can buy skins and

751
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,220
everything that people make and you can actually sell them and make some money

752
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:15,700
off of it as well I did notice that because I was like where is all the 4k

753
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:20,580
stuff that Microsoft was talking about at the last e3 I don't think that's ever

754
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,820
come out it never yeah it still is not came out they have that it's like the

755
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,540
super awesome super duper graphics pack or whatever is supposed to be concurrent

756
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:32,140
with the 4k and it kept getting pushed back and it I think the latest updates

757
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:35,380
was may where they were looking at so yeah all that stuff is still not out

758
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:39,820
because the 4k I think is a free update but they're anticipating a lot of people

759
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:44,220
are gonna buy this well I just want the nicer graphics just even not necessarily

760
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:48,740
4k because I don't have a 4k monitor on my laptop but I'll take the super duper

761
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:52,700
take whatever I can get yeah which is it's so funny to be sitting here going

762
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:58,180
minecraft 4k super duper but it is especially you know in the windows 10

763
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:01,340
where you have such an awesome like distance draw and everything it is it is

764
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:05,780
really impressive you know for what it is for what it is so apparently anyways

765
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:09,660
since people can't upload their own skins that they make to the store and

766
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:13,780
try to sell them some people are uploading some malicious skins to the

767
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:19,020
storefront that were basically PNG files that had malicious code inside of them

768
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:23,820
that would cause malware to appear on this on any system that they're run on

769
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:29,700
so there was three skins that they identified they were affected by it and

770
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:35,020
looks like there's like a yellow diving suit some blue hoodie thing and some

771
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:42,020
guides I don't know covered in colors for some reason anyways so they've

772
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:48,740
caught this and remove them and my ground is basically said that the

773
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:52,700
minecraft players that upload skin you know as a PNG file they can contain

774
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:56,700
malicious code this code would not be run or read by the game itself while

775
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:00,700
your antivirus software might detect this code and alert you to its presence

776
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:04,380
the code would not be able to run by itself but they're saying that the

777
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:11,260
people 50,000 users got infected by this of the apparently 74 million players and

778
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:15,180
with that you know they received messages and their minecraft accounts

779
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:19,980
saying you know your ass got glued you have maxed out your internet usage for a

780
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:25,620
lifetime and you're nailed but a new computer this is a piece of shit

781
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:31,700
Wow it seems like I told them kitty thing to do it so just be careful or

782
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:36,300
maybe just hold off on buying skins you don't really know now I'm sitting here

783
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,820
going why haven't we made a vog skin like try to try to make a little side

784
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:45,460
coin for vog maybe we need to get on that a little like a little pack that

785
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:49,460
has like a vog shirt and a maybe a bobby shirt I'm assuming he'd be down for this

786
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:54,260
a bobby black wolf logo shirt maybe something for olr sir ferret first mr.

787
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:58,420
smoocher I'll sell smooches likeness why not also also I will sell out mr. smoosh

788
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:03,460
to the highest bidder just there's not the cat himself I would never anyway

789
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:09,100
alright moving on let's talk about again another story about fortnight but this

790
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:13,540
one's a little bit different because it involves cliff B who is no longer with

791
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:16,620
epic games he was probably most well-known when he was at epic games

792
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:21,660
but he actually left epic in 2012 to do a new company that is called boss key

793
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:27,060
boss key made a game called law breakers that I think kind of came and went in it

794
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:32,140
yeah they've got their that's a game now radical heights is that new game their

795
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:35,940
own type of battle royale game that's very like I just looked at it and I was

796
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:41,380
like oh this is a Loki game no not really I did it doesn't look that great

797
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:44,740
I don't know really cuz it's all like neon I love that they have like a little

798
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:48,660
arcade machine in the screen yeah you like taco time you get money you pay for

799
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:52,020
stuff in like vending machines and I don't know I kind of thought it looked

800
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:55,700
cool although fantastic our chat said oh god radical heights what a joke all

801
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:59,920
right maybe I need to look into it a little more but anyway apparently cliff

802
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:04,900
went on Twitter and fired some shots at epic the company he used to work for

803
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:08,940
epic of course ended up making fortnight but cliff said in a tweet hey

804
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:14,460
at epic games could you please stop trying to hire away my team we just

805
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:19,420
launched radical heights on ue4 and are really happy with how it's going we have

806
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,220
plenty of ways to make it our own but they may never see the light of day if

807
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:26,520
they keep doing this apparently this move to attract boss key developers over

808
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:31,900
to fortnight is a little bit more of a recent thing hmm and also it's worth

809
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,500
noting both of these games are battle royale games that are that are bright

810
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:39,820
colorful they don't quite look like pub G pub G's a little more of the gritty

811
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:45,860
realistic kind of look these other games are very cartoony so apparently Bosque

812
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:50,880
has lost more than one employee to epic games recently former programmer William

813
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,820
McCarroll goes over to epic and replied to the tweet by saying it's presumptuous

814
01:01:54,820 --> 01:02:00,100
to suggest that epic is poaching employees with all due respect assuming

815
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:04,100
that epic is the one starting contact poaching is a bit presumptuous we've all

816
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:08,940
had our own reasons for making the choice to leave BK P Bosque for epic and

817
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:14,340
to act like we are commodities being stolen is a bit hurtful we are people

818
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:21,180
first and forenote most oh shit some drama is going down in the battle royale

819
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:27,380
world but anyway just kind of interesting I mean something we kind of

820
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:31,660
forget you know again there's a lot of people hard-working people to go beyond

821
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:35,980
making behind making these games and sometimes they leave for greener grass

822
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:40,500
somewhere else in the industry that sucks but like when it's funny those not

823
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,020
even necessarily this situation but you know how like blue holes kind of pissed

824
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:47,940
off it you know they said Fortnite copied their formula wait till all the

825
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:53,660
other ones come out wait till how pissed they are then I hope they're working on

826
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:58,580
pub g2 or something else to really you know or some other type of like you know

827
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:02,460
to keep themselves hey hey don't forget about us don't forget about us cuz yeah

828
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,860
I think you're right like they're just gonna get more and more upset as this

829
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:10,780
pool gets more and more diluted which is gonna be a theme at this year's e3

830
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:15,900
absolutely I mean I know that picture that was going around on Twitter was

831
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:21,060
just a joke but there's some truth in that you can't chase you can't chase

832
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:24,900
what's popular you got to be the trendsetter I mean that's think of

833
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:28,860
something unique yeah what's a new spin you can put on by the because that's

834
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:33,340
kind of what it is like you you have the game that comes out and if it's pretty

835
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:37,820
unique and stuff granted pub G wasn't the first battle battle royale game but

836
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:41,740
you know then Fortnite comes out and kind of did it better and so now they're

837
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:45,820
the pop more popular one well some would argue if it's really better pub G still

838
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:50,540
has many many fans true I think the free-to-play aspect of it though is

839
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:54,260
better because at least you know there's not much to invest there that's

840
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:59,420
true but I think that everybody's gonna try to get a piece of that pie now and

841
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,420
it's just are they gonna be really innovating on this or is it just gonna

842
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:09,580
be kind of like me too me too yeah yeah yeah maybe what the pub G folks was

843
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:13,720
her name blue blue hole what they need to do is team up with Nintendo and make

844
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,580
a game called Yoshi's murder island and then blue hole will be at the top of

845
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:21,700
their game so I think that's what needs to happen in that meanwhile dark soccer

846
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:26,260
would be up for us in the news well I'm excited and waiting for Deadpool 2 and

847
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:32,100
I'm going to be super happy to watch it but the director is adapting a video

848
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:38,140
game and I don't know the last dead both I guess the Deadpool game that came out

849
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:44,100
was hilarious but not great it controlled really crap I don't know I

850
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:46,940
watched the cutscenes on that game I didn't actually play the game and I was

851
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:50,860
fucking laughing my ass off I was on the first mission and it was just impossibly

852
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:56,060
hard to control although I loved going around this house that was funny I just

853
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:59,780
remembered there was a scene though where he had a sentinels foot it was a

854
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:04,420
foot or a hand and he was flying around in it with a dog and he ended up killing

855
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:08,900
one of the bad guys that's how he just like the big bad guys all zoom just

856
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:15,420
slammed it down on him and it was hilarious but at any rate the director

857
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:25,020
David leech is going to be directing the video game adoption so he also is

858
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:32,740
directing the division that's based off of one of the Tom Clancy games so who

859
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:37,860
knows what'll happen but I hope that it controls better than the Deadpool game

860
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:44,540
did but has all the same hilariousness in it so apparently he's also doing

861
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:53,420
another fast and furious spin-off with the rock okay he's a busy busy guy well

862
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:58,100
when you make a movie like Deadpool you're probably pretty in demand I would

863
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:02,340
reckon so all right just a few more stories for you guys in the classic game

864
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:07,620
of the week so SNK is celebrating their 40th anniversary and so when a game

865
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:10,980
company celebrates its 40th anniversary what's that mean it's got to put out

866
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:14,700
another mini console obviously because that's the new thing that's the new

867
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:20,260
hotness so um it wasn't that long ago actually SNK kind of re-released the

868
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:24,580
Neo Geo they did like the little mini system with some games in there as well

869
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:29,940
but now they're planning on doing it kind of teasing it right now a new

870
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:36,740
compilation system perhaps basically says a new game machine and they have a

871
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:42,540
picture of something underneath like a looks like a cloak or something that

872
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,740
says Neo Geo so could we see like a Neo Geo mini with a bunch of Neo Geo games

873
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:52,420
in it I hope so and I hope it doesn't cost a Neo Geo price that's right that's

874
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,100
about it yeah I would so get a Neo Geo mini are you kidding that would be

875
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:00,620
awesome be careful the other ones had really shitty emulation in them okay

876
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:04,380
assuming it is a quality product especially if they come with like

877
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:08,020
actual like fighter stick type controllers or you can use like if you

878
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:12,020
had the real thing if you could use them on it yes that would be rad so yeah I

879
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:16,420
would so be down like and I would even pay like you know a slightly increased

880
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:20,260
price if those controllers are fucking bomb the controls are good and the

881
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:24,340
emulation is good then yeah for sure oh my god just as long as fatal fury

882
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:29,300
special isn't it I'm good and not real about a half fatal fury special not real

883
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:33,780
about real that wasn't bad I didn't like real about but fatal very special I

884
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:37,780
think I have fatal either a fatal fury to or fatal fury special on Neo Geo well

885
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:42,220
I mean they're not that different very specials just all the one characters and

886
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:47,940
fatal very to basically yeah as my favorite he has my old Neo Geo system oh

887
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:54,340
really well cuz I had a MVS that was in my arcade cabin I bought that with a

888
01:07:54,380 --> 01:08:00,380
totally legit 68 and one cart that has all these different games in it and I

889
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:05,300
think I sent it to him with what they call that oh is that when all the

890
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:09,180
systems fried in the storm well no it was it was with a because I have a bunch

891
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:15,900
of these very column basically a way to hook up arcade hardware to TVs he says

892
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:19,720
a super gun super gun thank you I couldn't remember the name so I sent it

893
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:26,840
to him with a super gun to nice run all right cool cool all right well I would

894
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,640
so be down for like an SNK mini as long as you know again the quality is good

895
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,920
because you know they put out a ton of those games on PlayStation 4 and switch

896
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,440
and stuff those arcade archives but like the pools getting a little diluted it

897
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,920
would just be nice to have like one collection with everything in one place

898
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,240
but again the price has got to be right you know I don't want to pay like $500

899
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:48,440
unless I mean if it's a nice fucking cabinet would like like if it looks

900
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:52,040
like your little VPD cabinet but it's like a neo geo official thing like then

901
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,040
maybe I'd pay several hundred dollars for it but I'm assuming they're gonna

902
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,620
try to make something that maybe just plugs into an existing you know that has

903
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:01,760
neo geo games on it that's true that is true I have to have you figure out what

904
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:08,640
I am plugged on that okay that hasn't been on in a long time so anyway anyway

905
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,280
moving on we got one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game

906
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:16,280
of the week and this one has to do with Sonic Mania Sonic Mania apparently got a

907
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:23,600
patch recently that is adding some new things they have done some animations to

908
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,280
transition stages because that was the feature in the old Sonic games was kind

909
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:31,000
of missing in Sonic Mania so now they have some new transitions that help out

910
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,040
the story this patch by the way it showed up on PlayStation 4 and I think

911
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,640
it was put out a little early but I'm assuming it'll be coming out for the

912
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:43,040
other systems very soon there's some other small features as well cutscenes

913
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:47,280
can be skipped menus have been changed additional moves from past games like

914
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:53,440
the insta shield the super peel out from Sonic CD and knuckles mode can be used

915
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:58,500
in save files and not just non save play you can also disable the time limit

916
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:02,200
which is pretty neat and you can do multiplayer without the stretch to

917
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,040
visuals so they've done a lot of little changes there to Sonic Mania to keep

918
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:10,920
that game exciting I thought Sonic Mania was a great little follow-up in the

919
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,440
Sonic franchise I'm excited to see it still getting some love all right

920
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:20,360
speaking of old games getting love every week here at Orange Laundry do we like

921
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,760
to jump into the gaming vault and dark soccer will find a game that she thinks

922
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:29,320
hey you should be checking this game out this is kind of a yeah I was gonna say

923
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:35,480
this is a very obscure game in a very obscure but in a popular series it's not

924
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:40,680
even that obscure it had a US release not on the system but it had it on

925
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:45,320
Gameboy on the Gameboy all right well let's get to it what is the classic

926
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:52,480
game of the week Rockman and Forte Mirei Mirei Kara no Chosha Chosensha and which

927
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:59,160
is Rockman and Forte challenger from the future it is developed by Capcom and

928
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:04,880
published by Bandai for the WonderSwan this particular one was only released

929
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,920
in Japan on the WonderSwan not even the WonderSwan color this is old school

930
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:16,200
and in this game of course it takes place in the year 20XX a group of robots

931
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:24,920
from the future called the dimensions attack Symphony City and there is one

932
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:30,440
robot Rockman who is trying to take care of everything called Rockman shadow and

933
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:35,520
he seems obsessed with destruction but the real Rockman is like this is fucked

934
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:44,120
up and tries to do something so anyway Wily sends Forte who we call base

935
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:50,760
over here to investigate as well so you can play as one or the other so in this

936
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:55,280
game there is some different control and actually my apologies it was the

937
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,280
original Rockman and Forte that came out on the Gameboy Advance as Mega Man and

938
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:06,240
base this one come out not this one yeah but basically Rockman plays you

939
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:13,560
know or Mega Man plays like he normally does but Forte has a rapid-fire standard

940
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:20,240
gun but it can't be fired while moving and he has a dash and a double jump

941
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:28,480
there's also another gameplay change from the earlier games the the robot

942
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,480
masters don't have a period of invincibility after being damaged you

943
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:36,400
can just keep pounding and pounding pounding and since the WonderSwan has a

944
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:41,120
third set of controls that are located above the traditional directional

945
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:47,720
controls you can play vertically so for example if you are playing on air con

946
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:51,240
man you are required to change how you hold it so that you can play the level

947
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:56,280
vertically a lot of that was in some of their puzzle games as well as the

948
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:02,120
Klonoa game so you also have the bolt systems you can collect these bolts so

949
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:07,280
that you can buy different items and they are universal you know like extra

950
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:12,520
lives or exclusive items like Rockman being able to get Rush, Eddie, Tango and

951
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:18,960
Beat and Forte can get gospel who is known as trouble over here and reggae

952
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:24,320
that's a bird robot that was the last time it was seen was in a 1983 Famicom

953
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,240
game called wily and right no rock board that's paradise and maybe I'll

954
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:33,440
cover that at some point some people don't really like it some people super

955
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:39,560
like it I thought it was a pretty fun little game so that's it it is again

956
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:45,240
called Rockman and Forte Mirai Kata no Chosensha thank you for pronouncing it

957
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,840
one more time so I don't have to I will say I'm not familiar with this game I

958
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:53,640
mean I remember the Gameboy Advance you know I played your old roommate's copy

959
01:13:53,640 --> 01:14:00,200
of this Oh drama central room I'm a central roommate his class I blast from

960
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:04,400
the past that is how I played this game oh boy all right yeah I was gonna say

961
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:09,200
like I have a WonderSwan but just not this game but I gotta say I mean I

962
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:13,120
realized we don't always highlight the best games in classic games the week

963
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,520
just games you should be paying attention to and I think most people

964
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,960
probably don't even know this one exists unless you really pay a close attention

965
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:22,640
to Japanese gaming it's probably not the best looking Mega Man game it wasn't

966
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,240
really ranked as one of the best playing games either but but it's better

967
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:32,160
than that Mega Man PC game and it's really not a bad game I enjoyed it I

968
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:38,200
thought it was a fun game yeah but um it but mostly I when I played the game so I

969
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:44,000
could play through his forte so yeah not a bad game all right there it is your

970
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,660
classic a game of the week one more time Darzaga I just closed it Mirai Kata no

971
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:55,540
Chosensha yes that make a man on the WonderSwan yeah all right all right

972
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:58,900

727 of our show it is April the 22nd of 2018 and our show is already in progress

979
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:37,900
we've got to get to some rapid-fire news here so let's do it

980
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:42,360
Loki why don't you start us off some rapid-fire news yes so apparently the

981
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:47,200
lineup for next month's free games with gold has kind of leaked out there was an

982
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:53,040
unlisted video on the Xbox YouTube channel that showed basically what the

983
01:15:53,040 --> 01:16:00,160
lineup was so what we've got coming for May for me for the Xbox one May 1st to

984
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:06,520
the 31st we've got super mega baseball 2 and from May 16th to June 15th

985
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:12,880
Metal Gear Solid 5 the phantom pain that's a pretty awesome free game the

986
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:17,400
Xbox 360 games that are compatible with Xbox one we have streets of rage from

987
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:24,960
May 1st to the 15th and vanquish from the 16th of the 31st so not bad at all

988
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:30,040
yeah those are some really good picks yeah Mel yourself five she's yeah

989
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,920
pretty awesome wish I know a lot of people are really into as well so this

990
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:38,800
is uh it was a good day yeah speaking of Konami Konami is making a new

991
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,320
Castlevania game for iOS so they have a game called Castlevania grimoire of

992
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:50,320
souls that's in closed beta right now in Japan and apparently the game is set you

993
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:55,400
know like most other castle games in a world which Dracula has been completely

994
01:16:55,400 --> 01:17:01,800
erased but someone decides to resurrect him as always as always what's gonna be

995
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:08,400
kind of unique though so this is a to 2d game but it also supports co-op play for

996
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:13,120
up to four players so that's kind of cool yeah but it's on the phone how am I

997
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:17,400
gonna control it appropriately right yeah I get your point there really I

998
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:21,560
don't know I just like I get excited when I hear new Castlevania and then

999
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:26,160
it's oh but it's that I mean the game sounds good in theory but again how am I

1000
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:29,600
supposed to control it on the phone well like a lot of companies they're very

1001
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,120
lazy importing their stuff over I guess we'll see this come to the switch and

1002
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:38,000
other platforms just the port of the iOS games well I mean if it's good then

1003
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:42,400
fine that would be great yeah all right well speaking of the switch and games

1004
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:46,040
that will be coming out on the switch the official Nintendo magazine actually

1005
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,840
there's oh no there is an official Nintendo magazine I was like wait what I

1006
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:52,440
thought they got rid of that no I think there is a in another in another country

1007
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:56,080
there's another Nintendo magazine but anyways the Spanish edition of the

1008
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,880
Nintendo magazine and there is a section on Pokemon for the switch it does

1009
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:05,000
confirm that the eighth generation of Pokemon will be in this new switch game

1010
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,320
so it is not like a reboot of gen 1 as some people have been speculating or

1011
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:13,960
anything like that the article also mentions the game will be in 2018 or

1012
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:19,040
later so it's not guaranteeing that it's gonna make this year but we'll see we'll

1013
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:23,040
see you know they got to get it right also they are rethinking that there will

1014
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:29,120
be new mechanics in this game so don't expect necessarily the same formula that

1015
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:34,520
we saw before so anyway also one other thing that maybe goes with this a little

1016
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,720
bit is that the company game freak has actually trademarked the term in Japan

1017
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:46,320
anyway ultra shiny great as if the shiny addiction wasn't bad enough now we may

1018
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,800
have ultra shinies we don't know what that means or anything like that but

1019
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:53,360
maybe that's gonna be one of these new game mechanics and yes I'll be sure to

1020
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,020
ask Shane all about it next time I see him although we just really don't know a

1021
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:00,400
lot right now outside of this term do you guys like hunting shinies and

1022
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:05,640
Pokemon go no I never get them I never get me the order the hair days only

1023
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:09,200
during the community and even during the community days like last time I got what

1024
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:15,080
to I got one shiny all together oh and the egg event a lot of people actually

1025
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,980
are really upset at me because I've actually hatched two shiny toga peas

1026
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:22,960
both during that event so I have a shiny toga pea and a shiny toy get tick or

1027
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,760
whatever it's called evolution which a lot of the local players are like you're

1028
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:32,600
fucking lucky I've never seen a shiny Toby so I have one Toby I'll take it

1029
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:38,000
and a pillow I'll take it JD and chat says I got a shiny mile today as part of

1030
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:45,560
a raid lucky we show anyone hmm all right anyway also moving on some

1031
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,680
information that you heard about in the intro to tonight's show it has to do

1032
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:54,640
with a leaked video oh boy another leak from Microsoft and this shows what the

1033
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:59,720
new Xbox Live avatars are gonna look like Microsoft needs depends they're

1034
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:04,800
quite leaky anyway these characters we know they've been under redesigned for a

1035
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,760
while we've seen some glimpses of what's gonna be but apparently now thanks to

1036
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:12,320
this video we know there's gonna be dozens of eye shapes hairstyles costumes

1037
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:17,000
moods meaning animations for your characters that's gonna be a new thing

1038
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,840
this ties into some earlier rumors that there was gonna be like a career system

1039
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,800
not achievements but like a career system that kind of runs side-by-side

1040
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:31,760
with that for your profile and that this career system may actually unlock

1041
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:39,280
customization items through loot boxes everybody's favorite but whatever they're

1042
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,200
just avatars I mean who sounds like it's just loot boxes for gay achievements

1043
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:48,120
which I'm fine I mean I have an Xbox Live avatar but my little picture is

1044
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:53,960
still the olr logo that was for a short time on the 360 as part of like one of

1045
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,480
those like gamerscore blog packs we were very lucky enough during our time with

1046
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,960
all games we're actually in one of those pack you can't get it anymore though

1047
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:04,040
sadly they delisted it from the store several years ago probably whatever we

1048
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:09,340
sign was only gonna be valid for a few years so yeah if you don't have the olr

1049
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:13,320
icon sadly you'll never get it unless I don't know you take a picture or

1050
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:20,040
something but I see a few I still have the PNG file for it yeah I put malicious

1051
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:23,280
code in there so that you know when you run it in your system it puts all the

1052
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,480
malware Bobby Blackwell says you can still get it I thought they delisted

1053
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:31,840
them oh you just need to know someone with the pack on a USB stick okay so you

1054
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,560
have to kind of do it that way you have to basically log in as somebody else and

1055
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,640
download it or some of that or Bobby says you have it on a new I have it on a

1056
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:43,640
USB stick so you can move it to a new 360 well that's good to know maybe

1057
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:49,480
that's something we need to give away to listeners a USB stick with all the old

1058
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:57,480
icons anyway how many of the shows in that pack are still on the air some of

1059
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,680
the all games should did dead pixel life have a picture in that because I know

1060
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:04,680
they're still around but I don't know how many in that pack are still actually

1061
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:09,600
on the air probably not a lot Oh video game outsiders was probably in that pack

1062
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,920
too because they were with all games for a while so they were probably in it

1063
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:17,480
too and I know they're still going so hmm interesting anyway um what else I

1064
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:21,000
want to say about this oh no word on when the new avatars will launch but

1065
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,800
everybody's probably guessing e3 would be a really good bet for that I'll be a

1066
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,760
really really good bet as something they could say is going live right now is all

1067
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,080
this avatar stuff at e3 dark saga we have for us before we get to releases

1068
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:42,040
has some stuff well it looks like night trap is going to be coming on to the

1069
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:50,220
switch thanks to limited run games so yay night trap isn't that good I know

1070
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:54,760
it's like it was funny like the first 5,000 times we've heard that night

1071
01:22:54,760 --> 01:23:01,080
Travis really joke now it's like okay it wasn't that good we're over it I heard

1072
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:07,000
the funny part is though I heard it's rated T for teen I have no idea how they

1073
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,320
pull that off with all the outrage that fucking game got back in the day it's T

1074
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:16,440
for teen like how how about s for stupid

1075
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:22,080
well anyway other news Kingdom hearts 3 is gonna have some minigames in it that

1076
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:27,240
look like little Game & Watch games although when I was looking at it the

1077
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:32,640
style of Mickey and Sora and many and all that look like the 30s era Mickey

1078
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:36,120
but you've got like a little Game & Watch child screen that you're playing

1079
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:41,560
them on so that's pretty funny but the little minigames are there's the barnyard

1080
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:46,680
battle the carnival kid giant land and musical farmer I wish this article used

1081
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:51,520
an Oxford comma so that I would know that giant land and musical farmer were

1082
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:57,320
two different games but it looks kind of neat I mean I think it'll be fun it

1083
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:00,960
doesn't say anything about how it's accessed it's just in the trailer but it

1084
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,920
looks cute I mean it'd be kind of neat if they did like some of these is like a

1085
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:08,840
little Oh see it looks like he's actually playing a handheld system in

1086
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:13,320
the game so maybe it's how you build up like more points or something you know

1087
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:17,520
what else would be neat a release date well there's that although they did

1088
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:22,720
confirm 2018 right so we know this is squares eventually where Enix is a big

1089
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:26,280
release for this year yeah so don't expect that thought fancy seven thing

1090
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:30,600
till next year it is what it is yeah I thought they did didn't what didn't like

1091
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:35,160
Japan have a d23 type of thing and they confirmed it's this year yeah it was a

1092
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:41,600
recent thing yes so I guess I guess we'll see with the next release anyway

1093
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,080
um or with e3 I'm sure they'll talk about when that will be out anyway

1094
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,640
because they announce the date does it mean they have to stick to that day

1095
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:53,160
that's very true hey it's gotta be right that's all it is gotta be right let's

1158
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:59,120
I instantly wanted to read it once farsight studios irons out the licensing

1159
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:03,720
for the pinball arcade for the switch I assume we won't be seeing an exclusive

1160
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:08,480
translation of the got live Super Mario Brothers table that comes from Robert M

1161
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:13,000
I'd love to see it yeah but it was terrible it wasn't wasn't there am I

1162
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,400
wrong wasn't there two tables wasn't there a smaller kids table and then

1163
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,800
there was like a big full-size I think that it was the same one but the kids

1164
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:25,600
yeah huh I think it just really had to do with it just it was a short body

1165
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:33,420
table anyway oh yeah not I think as far as as I know the only one was the you

1166
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:38,360
know the the short kid table was the pipe came out and shot the ball out yeah

1167
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:43,640
yeah tables just weren't very good do any of these collections have the

1168
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:49,160
return from Mars in there actually yes I know I've played that table in one of

1169
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:54,040
these collections shit I don't remember which one it was it was revenge from

1170
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,960
ours or whatever I don't remember because it was attacked from ours and

1171
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,460
then the pinball 2000 was revenge from ours yes revenge from I thought the

1172
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:03,900
pinball 2000 version was in one of those packs but maybe I am confusing it with

1173
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:08,100
the old one yeah there weren't really too many of those pinball 2000 tables

1174
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:11,620
anyway maybe in our chat somebody knows over at live.vognetwork.com wasn't there

1175
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:17,940
only one other game they did the there was one other episode one oh that's

1176
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:20,980
right there was there's a Phantom Menace table in that same yeah I was

1177
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:24,420
that's right I mean it was a fun table if that movie hadn't been annoying as

1178
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:30,200
shit and you got to thwack Jar Jar Binks to the ball so that's always fun yes but

1179
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:38,960
the next email here hey OLR crew AZHP here I've been behind on or is it as HP

1180
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:46,200
I should ask I've just never bothered we always said AZHP okay or is it as it's

1181
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,760
like that the cupid sound really I've been behind on the podcast for a few

1182
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,520
months and as such haven't written in a while since my responses wouldn't be

1183
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:57,280
very timely however one thing has cropped up fairly frequently in the past

1184
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:01,680
few months on your show that I had to address every time the subject of pub G

1185
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:04,840
versus fortnight comes up many of the hosts are quick to say something to the

1186
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:08,560
effect of pub G tried to pursue legal action against fortnight because

1187
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,760
fortnight is doing better than pub G the reason pub G pursued legal action

1188
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:16,640
against epic regarding fortnight is a little more nuanced than this

1189
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:19,840
fortnight's marketing reference pub G directly when they announced their

1190
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:26,440
battle royale mode this coupled with the fact that epic the makers of the unreal

1191
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:30,760
engine which pub G runs on was releasing a free mode in their floundering game

1192
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:35,840
and what was clearly a reactionary move to pub G success could be construed as a

1193
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,560
conflict of interest as they could theoretically hold back engine

1194
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:43,320
improvements to pub G in order to give their own game a competitive advantage

1195
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:47,520
in the marketplace that being said if what you reported two weeks ago is true

1196
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,040
in pub G is now pursuing legal action against other games for copying aspects

1197
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:54,520
of their game that's a lot less defensible as Robin look you rightly

1198
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:59,160
pointed out look and feel of the video game cannot be trademarked as proven in

1199
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:03,000
the street fighter versus fighters history legal battle of the 1990s now

1200
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,720
I'm not asking you guys to stop bagging on pub G if that's what you feel like

1201
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:10,920
doing but I thought that I should chime in with extra information that you may

1202
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,920
not have known about so you can all have the facts before choosing to criticize

1203
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:19,240
them yours truly is HP for the record I haven't said shit about it well and to

1204
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:23,960
be fair I'm not bagging on pub G I'm bagging on the executives and the things

1205
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:28,320
that they do and say and yes kind of goes in line with that I know pub G has

1206
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:33,200
his fans I'm not gonna disrespect that you know just like we hardly ever talk

1207
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:36,280
about sports games on the show but I recognize those games have their fans

1208
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,400
and like you know they're super into it and that's cool but here's the other

1209
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:44,520
thing like I understand the nuance with the engine specifically is I think the

1210
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:49,840
thing that kind of differentiates this however to use other games in your games

1211
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:53,200
marketing I don't think that is particularly anything new because I kind

1212
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:57,320
of there was a legal case about that in the past well and I go I go back my head

1213
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:00,280
just goes back to you know again I'm dating myself here gonna I go back to

1214
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:04,160
the old magazines with the Genesis does wouldn't intend don't you know that

1215
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:09,440
whole thing right and then you know like I know those neo geo ads used to call

1216
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,800
the shit out of the other game makers because their thing was so beefy

1217
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:17,240
powerful and $1,000 but that's you know that was one thing these do so there'd

1218
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:22,040
been a legal case on it in the past to where it was said that you can use

1219
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:27,560
another game from another system as a point of comparison to advertise your

1220
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:32,400
product right right but I I do realize where things get a little dicey now when

1221
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:36,240
it comes to the engine and just kind of like you know where and I hell yeah

1222
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:40,040
fortnight this battle royale thing they added was like a last-ditch thing to

1223
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:45,360
save their game it worked though mm-hmm like I mean we kind of have to be mad

1224
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:50,320
because you didn't think about it well but the problem is they did think about

1225
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:58,040
it but they didn't think about doing it for free okay so for tonight found a way

1226
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:02,520
to make it free and probably for that reason is why it's doing so more six

1227
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:06,920
like I only checked it out cuz it was free if PUBG was free I probably would

1228
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:13,080
have checked that out so not not to mention that there's been complaints

1229
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:19,720
about you know there still being some kinks in the game in PUBG so dark to see

1230
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:23,920
and Chad says didn't they do things like brand X in the 50s for that so they

1231
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:28,400
still do that or like competitor brand or yeah because sometimes they just

1232
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:32,200
simply don't want to name the other brand you know love competitor brand

1233
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:35,760
competitors but then you also though now have like for example your cell phone

1234
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:40,840
companies compared to X Network you know and they'll name them by name sure and

1235
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:44,600
like Coke and Pepsi always call each other out don't they mm-hmm yeah but

1236
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,760
you're right I know what you're talking about with the brand X thing cuz

1237
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:50,040
sometimes when it comes to like this makes me think of Batman I remember like

1238
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:54,120
a catch-up thing where it's like this ketchup is better than nine out of ten

1239
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:58,280
people prefer this ketchup to brand X oh it just makes me think of the the the

1240
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:03,240
scene in the 90s Batman with Jack Nicholson he's like they're using brand

1241
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:09,560
X fantastic with a very fair counterpoint in our chat PUBG mobile is

1242
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:14,120
free that's right it is free it's but it's mobile and you all know how I feel

1243
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:18,440
about controlling something mobile but if it's free I should I did download it

1244
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:22,240
and I launched it and that's as far as I got because I was like I wasn't on Wi-Fi

1245
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:25,760
that's what it was I wasn't on Wi-Fi when I launched it I was like wait a

1246
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:31,200
minute this is not a game you want to play on on mobile data so I'll check

1247
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:36,200
that out later though so last email that came in actually quite literally before

1248
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:41,560
I loaded from when it opened the first mail to open the second so like in

1249
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:48,200
before the buzzer right okay this comes from smash og through the website so

1250
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:52,000
people are still using that sup olr this is the first time I've been able to

1251
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,320
listen live due to my work hours so that's pretty cool well thank you for

1252
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:00,280
listening like yeah thanks for being here anyway I think you have been over

1253
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:04,480
this topic before but refresh my memory what game releases this year are you

1254
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:08,800
almost excited about for me it's Red Dead Redemption 2 for sure the first Red

1255
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,640
Dead was one of the few games that I could actually play all the way through

1256
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:18,720
was like binge watching a good TV series anyway how about you good question I'm

1257
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:24,240
even if we and look let's be real in 727 episodes of olr we repeat stuff

1258
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:27,760
sometimes it happens like fuck there's things where it's like did we just talk

1259
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,000
about this four weeks ago but you know I don't know I don't remember last week

1260
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,960
sometimes when you get together with the same group of people every time

1261
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:40,960
sometimes the same topics come up it just happens so what games are you

1262
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:44,320
looking forward to well Red Dead Redemption 2 has got to be on your list

1263
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:52,280
as well yeah yeah of course anything else besides that one I was I was

1264
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:58,040
looking forward to black ops 4 yeah that was until all the rumored news right now

1265
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:04,400
so I'm not looking forward to it now and I don't even know if I'd buy it even if

1266
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:09,600
it was okay coming out cuz like I thought about I got like what was the

1267
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,880
last game I think it advanced warfare and I was like oh yeah I'm gonna buy the

1268
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:18,560
season pass and play online with all my friends and that was just all money

1269
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:22,040
thrown away cuz I didn't end up playing it very much I played through the

1270
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:26,960
campaign campaign was fun but that's kind of all I play through those

1271
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:32,880
nowadays is the campaign I mean I'll wait until e3 to hear what else is

1272
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,080
coming out because I think a lot of that stuff I don't know what's in the

1273
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,960
pipeline yeah that's the thing I kind of feel like you should ask this question

1274
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:44,680
again in June because we there's a lot of things that are probably coming out

1275
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:49,640
this year that we don't know about yet so that'd be that for me though okay I

1276
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:52,800
got I got one more okay so crackdown three would be the other one okay

1277
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:58,600
assuming it comes out ever I'm sure it will it's gotta be it's gotta be 2017 or

1278
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:07,200
18 or 19 or 20 for me Kingdom Hearts 3 absolutely assuming they mean that 2018

1279
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:11,760
date I would say Metroid Prime 4 if that was the thing that Nintendo was teasing

1280
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:15,000
for this year that's kind of where we need e3 because I would also kind of put

1281
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,040
Pokemon Gen 8 on that list for the switch I really want to see how Pokemon

1282
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:21,880
goes to the switch so that would be on my list as well I'm gonna go to the

1283
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:26,200
mobile phone round two I am super curious about Harry Potter wizards unite

1284
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:31,480
yes because that is of course you know it's Niantic isn't making the game I

1285
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:35,440
think it's port key games who's doing the other Harry Potter mobile game is

1286
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:40,400
working with Niantic probably borrowing Niantic's portal network basically to

1287
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:44,800
make the Harry Potter wizards unite game so I'm super curious about that and I

1288
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:49,560
imagine that's gonna be a 2018 game I'm curious about the Mario Kart mobile game

1289
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:54,920
oh I forgot it was a thing Jamie shit we probably Animal Crossing oh you you're

1290
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,960
still holding out hope for a new Animal Crossing yeah with the leaks a couple

1291
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:02,760

dark Sakura and don't fuck it up alright let's get to some more news before we

1323
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:32,240
get to the skype line Loki alright so there's a game called halo online that

1324
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:40,680
was announced back in I think 2015 so the farthest it went was actually it did

1325
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:47,080
a beta test in Russia in 2015 but it didn't really get much further than that

1326
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:53,320
but apparently there's been a mod project going on called El Dorado and

1327
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:58,280
they've been working on basic El Dorado like those cities of gold and all that

1328
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:03,440
somebody say Doritos it was it's L do Rito so it's weird

1329
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:10,600
el de wr ito it is it's do Mountain Dew and Doritos get it that's what they're

1330
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:15,320
doing I got it you made a joke I got it all right you got that

1331
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:21,640
reference so basically this has been worked on since 2016 and two they're

1332
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:25,840
trying to take this game that was kind of partially made and bring it up to

1333
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:30,760
like a full game and so now they have the 0.6 update which brings the game

1334
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:36,200
even closer to halo 3 they've developed its upgraded graphics new maps they have

1335
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:42,200
their own Forge map editor it looks pretty awesome so they have actually

1336
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:48,680
like a trailer you can check out and everything but yeah I mean it's pretty

1337
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:55,880
awesome looking size you doing chat says isn't a halo already online what dumb

1338
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:59,840
asses well I think this is supposed to be like a free-to-play game type of

1339
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:04,080
thing I think was it supposed to be more like MMO II to I don't say well it's MMO

1340
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:07,920
it was a battle royale yeah I think it was more along the lines of like they

1341
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:11,680
have like a Call of Duty online that was like in China it's basically a free to

1342
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:15,520
play game and they have like maps that appeared in the console versions of the

1343
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,720
game but you know there's all the free-to-play mechanics in there as well

1344
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:24,000
like you know I guess loop well I say free-to-play mechanics nowadays but now

1345
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:29,680
that I think of it it's actually more of just mechanics now that are in games you

1346
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:34,520
know where you can purchase skins and stuff like that so far they have not

1347
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:38,720
received the cease-or-desist or any further takedown actions yet they said

1348
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:42,120
they're taking careful steps and distribution of 0.6 to make sure that

1349
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:49,880
doesn't happen yeah so interesting though that this is a thing that's been

1350
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:54,560
worked on but yeah it looks really polished is so far even yeah interesting

1351
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:59,000
how a modders are gonna finish that up when Microsoft wouldn't or bungee or

1352
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,080
whoever was doing it at that time it was three four three games yeah oh yeah

1353
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:05,000
because this would have been after the transition right yeah okay it was

1354
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:12,000
apparently this was announced I guess right around the time of halo 5 so kai's

1355
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,960
judo and chat says they need to do a halo battle royale game be careful what

1356
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:23,640
you wish for because I you know Microsoft Microsoft wants people to buy

1357
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:27,400
Xbox ones and wants people to be jazzed about their exclusives everybody's

1358
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:31,280
talking about God of War this week but Microsoft's like hey sea of thieves

1359
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:36,400
hello they want people to remember they got exclusives too so I think a halo

1360
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:40,120
battle royale that's it's gonna happen battle royale like you know what like

1361
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:43,480
even they go back to Minecraft I remember one of the like more popular

1362
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:47,640
mods that was that round was the hunger game mods yeah so they were basically

1363
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:51,360
just cribbing that but like it would be nice to have like an official game oh

1364
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,400
that was like no maybe not call it hunger games you can call battle royale

1365
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:57,960
or something like that where is played very similarly where you you don't have

1366
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:00,640
to have like a mod or something to set it up you know that would be compatible

1367
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:08,200
with the console versions would be nice all right let's talk about twitch

1368
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:13,120
because twitch got banned in an entire country this week that's not pleasant

1369
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:17,480
news twitch got banned in Russia what okay well here's the thing it didn't

1370
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:21,880
actually get banned they got blocked and it was inadvertent and it's because

1371
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:26,800
Russia is kind of putting some smackdown on some IPs owned by Amazon and Google

1372
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:31,840
the reason why this all goes back to the messaging app telegram you guys ever use

1373
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:35,800
telegram no I've used it for ingress related things it's basically just a

1374
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:39,200
chat app okay it's a chat app but the thing about it is you can actually

1375
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:43,520
encrypt your messages in telegram so you can send messages that are encrypted so

1376
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:48,800
that way the government can't watch you okay and Russia and the security people

1377
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:54,000
there don't like that because they want to be able to access data messages so

1378
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:59,040
Russia is trying to ban telegram telegram relies on Amazon and Google's

1379
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:04,720
cloud services so the communications regulator in Russia has bulk banned a

1380
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:08,760
significant number of IP addresses and IP gates that are owned by the companies

1381
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:14,240
so Amazon being that they own twitch basically twitch is getting caught in

1382
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:18,280
the crossfire of all this so it has nothing to do a twitch it's telegram a

1383
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:24,760
messaging app how about that so there you go so so far anyway it doesn't seem

1384
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:27,720
like twitch can still be accessed in Russia and of course that has some

1385
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:35,600
people kind of irritated about it so anyway some folks are using VPN and tor

1386
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:39,440
to get around it and actually write messages on the actual twitch website

1387
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:43,800
and that was according to one I think broadcaster over on reddit that was

1388
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:50,640
talking about how to get around that ban so there you go going to our chat

1389
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:55,880
over at live dot vog network comm some comments on telegram JD says furries use

1390
01:47:55,880 --> 01:48:00,960
telegram heavily I did not know that Sia Tabiri says telegram has some great

1391
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:06,400
emoji though that is true there is a very large sticker database of emoji

1392
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:12,400
available in telegram so that's kind of neat let's see also over at chat live

1393
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:16,320
dot vog network comm s 200 Matt says everyone is getting VPNs over there then

1394
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:21,120
yeah I think that's probably something's becoming more and more popular so

1395
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:26,480
dungeon buster points out the great firewall of Russia hmm see the berry

1396
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:32,160
says Putin's just upset he can't get more viewers than buzzer does he have a

1397
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:35,840
twitch channel I don't know about that I know there are some Russian broadcasters

1398
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:41,120
would it be like Putin plays yeah Putin plays I don't know maybe maybe which are

1399
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:44,160
there any political leaders who you would watch if they had a twitch channel

1400
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:49,280
maybe Justin Trudeau what I would watch Justin Trudeau play retro games

1401
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:56,440
absolutely probably not all right um let's move on Loki why don't we go to

1402
01:48:56,440 --> 01:49:02,120
your next story all right so some well the Netherlands has deemed some loot

1403
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:10,560
boxes that are in popular games are considered gambling so they did a study

1404
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:15,240
looking into ten different games with loot boxes and declared that at least

1405
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:20,280
four of them were in violation of vetting and Gaming Act and then

1406
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:26,160
apparently I thought was a total six from what I saw the biggest reason for

1407
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:29,960
the decision they said that these four games allowed the the sale and trade of

1408
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:37,120
items externally through websites giving the items a market value six other games

1409
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:40,800
that were studied which were not in violation of laws but we're still

1410
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:49,560
heavily criticized for their addictive qualities they didn't state which games

1411
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:56,080
were studied although with the speaking with the broadcast company nos they said

1412
01:49:56,080 --> 01:50:03,520
that they brought a Dota 2 rocket League pub gene FIFA 18 as examples of loot

1413
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:09,280
boxes breaking the law and said offering these type of gameplay chances

1414
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:16,000
to Dutch players without a license is prohibited so interesting and also

1415
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,280
something to keep in mind is that the US is not the only country that's gonna

1416
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:22,320
have something to say on these loot box issues and certainly we've referenced

1417
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:25,680
many times that China kind of put out those odds laws where they had to

1418
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:28,800
publish the odds there it's going to be interesting as these other companies

1419
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,880
weigh in on how they want loot boxes handled because many of these games are

1420
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:37,280
sold in many places besides just the US and you know Canada and stuff yeah so

1421
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:42,360
that'll be interesting alright one story I want to talk to you guys about is

1422
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:47,880
about a game a fan game that's coming out called the 13th doll the 13th doll

1423
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:53,960
is going to be referencing old-school CD-ROM games like FMV full motion video

1424
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:59,320
type games it's actually a seventh guest fan game so the 13th doll is trying to

1425
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:03,840
recapture the I just say that very much for seventh gas yeah it is it's at the

1426
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:08,800
13th all a fan game of the seventh guest so anyway it is going to return to the

1427
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:13,840
mansion of the toy maker Henry stuff and we'll follow tad the seventh guest from

1428
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,000
the previous journey and these left with scarred and racked with guilt from the

1429
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,520
experience so he will be going back to the mansion to hopefully free the

1430
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:27,240
victims anyway there's a new doctor that gets in there as well 26 unique puzzles

1431
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:30,360
throughout the mansion and so on and so on they are looking to release this on

1432
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:34,920
Halloween 2018 so I'm sure fans of the seventh guest will be excited about that

1433
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:38,880
so they are clearly saying it's a fan game they're not trying to make it

1434
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:45,680
official cannon but that is kind of neat I'm surprised legally it's okay but maybe

1435
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:48,880
they got some type of permission for the original makers I doubt they're going

1436
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:53,040
anywhere with it they still try to put out like seventh guest stuff on like I

1437
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:56,520
know there's like a version on mobile phones and stuff yeah they've still been

1438
01:51:56,520 --> 01:52:01,960
trying to milk that franchise all these years later it does not age well no it

1439
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:05,320
doesn't it really doesn't so it'd be interesting to see how a fan game kind

1440
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:09,160
of brings a lot of that in because now it'll all be in high definition I think

1441
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:14,920
yes that is definitely in low definition nowadays yes yeah it doesn't those old

1442
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:20,280
CD-ROM games really didn't age well but they know what I'm sad that one CD-ROM

1443
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:24,920
game I have not seen brought the steam that I used to play the shit out of was

1444
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:31,520
mega race I'm surprised that they don't have a mega race game coming back I want

1445
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:37,280
a mega race game yeah are there any um are there any 90s games that should be

1446
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:40,760
coming back well mega race I want that uh-huh

1447
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:46,760
besides that sorry besides that CD I'm thinking CD based maybe I'm always

1448
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:51,560
Sierra adventures but those are really FMV is he said phantasmagoria yeah that

1449
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:54,840
of course is kind of alleged I thought that I can't that was already I've been

1450
01:52:54,840 --> 01:53:02,800
released um I think so let's see Bobby Blackwell says sewer shark dungeon buster

1451
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:06,400
says ripper with more Christopher Walken how about Gabriel Knight with more Tim

1452
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:11,160
Curry although that wasn't really an FMV game either was it oh he just voiced a

1453
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:15,920
character in that game how about the old making the video stuff from Sega CD oh

1454
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:21,720
god the crisscross and you know what music factory I have the marky mark one

1455
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:26,840
and the crisscross one you need to eat the CNC music factory one wasn't there a

1456
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:31,040
CNC one I think there was another one that was like the last one yeah someone

1457
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:34,600
wants to send me the CNC one so my collection will be complete whoopty shit

1458
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:38,920
but you know yeah all right anyway before we get to your calls at orange

1459
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:42,600
lounge radio all one word on Skype we've got one more story for you guys tonight

1460
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:47,680
drama and it has to do with the never-ending soap opera of 80s video

1461
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:52,080
game playing I should find the you know you need to find me I need the intro to

1462
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:57,160
like sands and the hourglass so are the days of our lives

1463
01:53:57,160 --> 01:54:01,960
see I could do that you can let me see how about uh something like that

1464
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:07,520
hopefully there's no see but they always buy this by the ads of our by this thing

1465
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:12,000
all right hold on let's let's get to it

1466
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:20,480
like sands through the hourglass so are the days of our lives so are the drama

1467
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:26,960
of our twin galaxies oh gosh see a Billy Mitchell is fighting back against twin

1468
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:32,840
galaxies yeah they removed all of his stuff and he's like well fuck you but

1469
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:39,920
probably nicer you know with some hot sauce added to it he is taking experts

1470
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:45,680
under to his home to show them his Donkey Kong loading screens so they can

1471
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:49,400
see that they are the real arcade loading screens and not emulator he's

1472
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:56,120
inviting strangers into his home to inspect his Donkey Kong girl and he also

1473
01:54:56,120 --> 01:55:03,240
wants to find witnesses for his high score the one million sixty two thousand

1474
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:08,160
eight hundred points that was at the boomers in Diana Beach so or sorry

1475
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:14,560
Dania Beach so um good luck I mean if he can do it that's great I don't see how

1476
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:18,440
showing them what his system looks like now because they can compare loading

1477
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:23,640
screens with the ones he sent in I get that but like it's been several years he

1478
01:55:23,680 --> 01:55:27,560
could have replaced the hardware in that cabinet since then I mean that's by no

1479
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:32,600
means a definitive oh well he didn't cheat I guess this video is just lying

1480
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:38,720
to us Elmore chart in our chat room says Billy Mitchell will win through the

1481
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:43,520
sheer power of luxurious hair let's not fool ourselves it's a weave it is a it

1482
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:49,800
is a Billy Mitchell's a little bit older that ain't his real hair it could be I

1483
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:59,640
don't think it is it's just emulated let's see JD in our chat over at live

1484
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:03,900

1488
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:30,960
yes the best scene they had in there was like they were talking about like

1489
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:35,560
something about like food or something I don't remember like how they would get

1490
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:42,440
how they would you know attract ladies to the ladies night thing in a bar or

1491
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:45,680
something like that and for summary of singles night how they would track

1492
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:49,720
ladies at singles night and for some reason the dude that was answering the

1493
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:54,560
question and I don't know why thought he said seagulls night and so he's like

1501
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:24,980

1502
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:29,680
past with my future a journey that will bring me to a strange and dark place to

1503
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:34,720
the edge of the sea high atop n7 studios a house called Robin Allen's place a

1504
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:39,120
world I've never known with people I've never met people who tonight are still

1505
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:46,120
only shadows in my mind but who will soon fill the days and nights of my do

1506
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:51,000
you get the reference I know I've heard it before opening to dark shadows right

1507
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:56,400
right right aim is Victoria Winters yes did I mean you know what dark shadows I

1508
01:57:56,400 --> 01:58:01,120
never saw I never did see the Burton movie that he did a couple years ago did

1509
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:04,760
did they start it off the same way with that I didn't see it actually I watched

1510
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:11,640
the redo but mom was telling me she mom was totally into the the redo because

1511
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:16,080
she watched dark shadows as a kid I yeah I love the dark shadows 90 reboot that's

1512
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:20,200
like the only one I've seen start to finish and boy is it a cliffhanger

1513
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:24,860
finish like that was some bullshit but the the dark shadows remake on in the

1514
01:58:24,860 --> 01:58:28,760
90s again if you want to take us back to games orange launch radio all one word

1515
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:33,920
on Skype the dark shadows reboot in the 90s that aired like while the Gulf War

1516
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:37,520
started you remember that and that was all happening nice so it wasn't really

1517
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:40,280
able to find its audience because it kept getting bumped and moved around and

1518
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:44,000
stuff because of ongoing Gulf War coverage so that show kind of got

1519
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:54,640
screwed did you know that I think it was the CW or was it before they they merged

1520
01:58:54,640 --> 01:59:01,200
into the new net wait wait it what was it called wb the WB so I think the WB

1521
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:05,360
back when it was that wanted to do a dark shadows reboot and they made a

1522
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:09,220
pilot and everything but they didn't pick it up to series but you know like

1523
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:13,100
the bread and butter of CW is a lot of those like the Vampire Diaries no like

1524
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:16,920
the DC comic show yes now that yeah there's tons of that so good they took

1525
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:20,420
Supergirl they've got arrow I mean the all that stuff I would think dark

1526
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:23,680
shadows would fit in really well with that type of lineup so I'm just I'm

1527
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:30,000
really surprised they didn't end up making a show about a QPN no UPN well I

1528
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:36,660
mean that was I mean UPN and WB merged and became CW except UPN had like no

1529
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:40,680
shows left by the time they said they had they got top model for a few years

1530
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:45,760
and what else from UPN like everything that was good on UPN went away like

1531
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:50,040
Buffy moved to UPN for the last few seasons right and then of course Voyager

1532
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:54,960
but those shows were done before that merger happened so I don't know anyway

1533
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:59,040
see a Tiberian chat says the Burton movie is interesting but it's basically

1534
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:04,600
a loving parody hmm anyway act F wants to know is the Skype line open yes

1535
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:09,080
Orange Lounge radio all one word Bobby wasn't getting any calls either so could

1536
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:15,040
it be Skype is no cuz he was able to call us it's weird anyway Kossett in

1537
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:21,980
chat says was Voyager and deep space 9 on UPN not DC's 9 deep space 9 and next

1538
02:00:21,980 --> 02:00:27,840
generation were in syndication so a lot of your TV networks that became UPN kind

1539
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:33,080
of picked that stuff up cuz I know here those are all on Fox 40 back in the day

1540
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:36,560
but they were like Saturdays in the afternoon was when those those shows

1541
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:42,300
aired like back-to-back but but that was before Fox had football when they really

1542
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:49,500
took off as a network so it was the early years I guess Elmo chart in our

1543
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:54,760
chat says I was a bit a bit of a goth in the 90s my mom was like let me tell you

1544
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:58,160
about this thing I watch called dark shadows and my little mind was blown

1545
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:02,400
yeah I mean dark I mean even the original soap opera was really kind of

1546
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:07,640
rad for its time you know it was made in what the 70s right did it start in the

1547
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:11,040
late 60s or did it start in the mid 70s I want to think it was the 60s but I'll

1548
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:14,920
find out give me a sec yeah so and then you know it's about its dark shadows is

1549
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:19,400
basically vampires and magic and all this stuff but like in a soap opera I

1550
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:26,800
don't think anything ever really matched it until my 1960s 1966 through 1971 okay

1551
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:31,360
my fave soap opera ever and yes I watched the soap opera for quite some

1552
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:36,360
time this soap opera was fucking amazing do you know what it is star Sakura you

1553
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:44,760
got to know what it is it was on NBC the late 90s really over the top holy crap

1554
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:51,400
because that was when mom was still it had Haley Mills sister in it fuck

1555
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:59,560
passions oh yeah that show was so fucking great because it was just like

1556
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:05,280
it was straight-up badly it was parody it was so bad it was good it was so good

1557
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:09,640
good job chatters kaijuto casa and see it to bury all light up there with

1558
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:14,480
passions yes with Tabitha and Timmy I distinctly remember an episode where

1559
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:22,840
Tabitha tied somebody to the train tracks and that was the drama that show

1560
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:26,200
is so fucking good I wish they bring it back they need to make a movie out of

1561
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:29,880
passions that's what I need to do anyway we got a call let's go to it hi you're

1562
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:32,920
on orange lounge radio who's this

1563
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:40,040
hello it's orange lounge radio and you are you might be muted good caller now

1564
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:48,600
would be the time to unmute yourself I feel like I hear chatting I hear typing

1565
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:56,520
but the person isn't talking okay sorry hi is this act F'd yeah it's

1566
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:02,480
exact F'd surprise how are you don't know what happened there but anyways

1567
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:05,440
that's all right you had an out-of-body experience for a moment what's on your

1568
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:11,360
mind buddy yeah anyways I could talk to us about so many stuff that you probably

1569
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:16,720
talked to tonight but I was so distracted with another thing I want to

1570
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:22,360
talk about Pokemon go we touched on Pokemon go but what's what's your

1571
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:26,160
experience what do you want to talk about with it especially about the

1572
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:32,880
missions they have right now with with with the mythical missions and also the

1573
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:39,000
field research mission I'm still working on that goddamn meal I got the stupid

1574
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:46,640
ditto I evolved the Magikarp thanks to the the Kanto event we just had I was

1575
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:51,560
able to get enough Magikarp candy that wasn't so hard now I am stuck on the 10

1576
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:58,320
raids and that's actually pretty easy to do you can't cheese it anymore you can't

1577
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:04,000
no you have because now it doesn't it counts the raid when you feed your raid

1578
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:08,640
pass it doesn't count the raid when you fail the raid over and over and over

1579
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:14,400
again I didn't know that yeah so I actually have to do 10 raids so which is

1580
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:18,560
fine I bought one of the boxes that had like 16 raid passes in it but it's like

1581
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:22,160
I'm not gonna go out of my way to do raids I don't want to do just to get

1582
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:26,820
this stupid achievement does that make sense oh yeah that at least that's like

1583
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:33,260
the easy part in that in those missions because yeah the Magikarp one was

1584
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:39,020
probably the hardest one finding the ditto was the hardest for me yeah without

1585
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:43,300
counting the ditto one though oh although for me it was kinda easy

1586
02:04:43,300 --> 02:04:49,460
because I did it pretty much instantly yeah obviously it was luck but still

1587
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:53,700
I'm not in a rush for Mew because real chat even though Mew is an awesome

1588
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:57,060
Pokemon and has a good story behind it and the fact that you know especially

1589
02:04:57,060 --> 02:05:01,260
with the first movie and everything and its status is a mythical Pokemon it's

1590
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:05,900
actually not a good Pokemon in the game like it's not a very powerful Pokemon

1591
02:05:05,900 --> 02:05:08,940
it's not one you're gonna use I don't even think you can put it in gyms or

1592
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:15,180
anything so I'm not really in a rush until they say like Celebi's coming or

1593
02:05:15,180 --> 02:05:20,100
Mew is end dated or something like that then I will rush to finish it but right

1594
02:05:20,140 --> 02:05:25,660
now I'm just kind of taking my sweet ass time yeah I also took my time with it

1595
02:05:25,660 --> 02:05:31,340
although I already had it but it's the what I want to talk about about the

1596
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:37,100
missions especially it's the the fact that it brings a lot of new life to the

1597
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:43,900
game I didn't stop playing Pokemon go any time since it launched back in 2016

1598
02:05:43,900 --> 02:05:49,660
so right now I'm still playing it every day but trying to do the missions it's

1599
02:05:49,660 --> 02:05:55,340
like a new incentive to play it's something that it needed the the game

1600
02:05:55,340 --> 02:06:01,120
needed a long time ago oh yeah no it's definitely put more into the game

1601
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:04,700
breathe more life in it like I really try to get those daily stamps done

1602
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:09,180
although man sometimes those quests you get are ridiculous like oh yeah spin

1603
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:12,780
three pokey stops you haven't spun before like I get I get what they're

1604
02:06:12,780 --> 02:06:17,700
doing with that but like I've I've hit a lot of because of Ingress and stuff I've

1605
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:21,420
hit a lot of pokey stops in this town like there's very little I haven't done

1606
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:28,140
unless I actually just got a new portal accepted in OPR in Ingress like three

1607
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:35,280
days ago and it is now a pokey stop at a park not far from my work so that I was

1608
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:38,540
able to spin that as a new pokey stop great I got to do that three times so

1609
02:06:38,540 --> 02:06:42,420
like that's hard to do and then I hate the one that's a three Oddish or Bell

1610
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:46,060
Sprout because I never see those things anyway I mean the Kanto event was one

1611
02:06:46,060 --> 02:06:50,180
thing they were everywhere the Oddish I had one that was three like Trico's or

1612
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:56,180
like something else it was like that one tree oh and market so with those like I

1613
02:06:56,180 --> 02:07:00,860
just throw them away and go to another pokey stop but you know it's like the

1614
02:07:00,860 --> 02:07:04,660
battle in a raid or throw two nice throws in a row or what I have one right

1615
02:07:04,660 --> 02:07:09,160
now I have two I have two instances of catch three insects so I'm earning them

1616
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:13,420
both at the same time okay there you go yeah

1617
02:07:13,420 --> 02:07:19,140
seriously I also have that one too that the bug one and I also have one to hatch

1618
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:25,620
three eggs and I already hatched one so that's gonna be eventually done but yeah

1619
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:29,660
that's the good thing about the the field missions that you can just throw

1620
02:07:29,660 --> 02:07:33,340
them away if you don't want to do them or can't do them because there's also

1621
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:40,660
one I have gotten to that's catch one dragon and well like really really

1622
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:47,020
Niantic if you can you can do that if you're gonna do a latios raid because

1623
02:07:47,020 --> 02:07:53,060
that is a dragon yeah yeah but still it's like since I don't have too much

1624
02:07:53,060 --> 02:07:58,700
time to play during the day because of work I barely can do any rates like in

1625
02:07:58,700 --> 02:08:04,380
at least in the weekdays only on weekend so I prefer to yes throw them away and

1626
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:07,820
and do another mission yeah that's fair yeah I've been really like I'll just

1627
02:08:07,820 --> 02:08:11,420
throw it away to get something I know I can do because I I have gotten my stamp

1628
02:08:11,420 --> 02:08:15,060
every single day since the start of this and every single moltres that's come

1629
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:20,780
with it my assumption is they'll rotate it out next month I have a feeling it is

1630
02:08:20,780 --> 02:08:24,380
on a monthly rotation because didn't this whole thing start though this whole

1631
02:08:24,380 --> 02:08:27,860
thing started right at the end of March right like wasn't like the first week

1632
02:08:27,860 --> 02:08:32,300
March 28 March 29 so here's the thing I bet the way they did it I bet Articuno

1633
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:37,900
was March's reward but because you couldn't finish it in March it went

1634
02:08:37,900 --> 02:08:41,140
right into the next reward which is moltres because this is the same order

1635
02:08:41,140 --> 02:08:44,900
the legendaries rolled out in the game with the exception of Lugea but they

1636
02:08:44,900 --> 02:08:49,060
just brought Lugea back to raids not that long ago so I bet next month this

1637
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:53,500
might be get guests we're gonna get Zapdos next month they'll realize the

1638
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:57,340
fuck up they made and then do Articuno at that point again and then it'll move

1639
02:08:57,340 --> 02:09:01,940
into the Lions and this is how people in areas where they complain they can't

1640
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:05,220
raid all the time this is how they're gonna get their legendaries because they

1641
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:09,340
did make it the raid legendaries are still better especially if you can get

1642
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:13,500
weather boosted because you're gonna get either a level 20 or if you can do a

1643
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:17,860
weather booster to 25 from a raid the ones you get from these catch sequences

1644
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:22,740
are only level 15 but it's better to have a level 15 Pokemon than none at all

1645
02:09:22,740 --> 02:09:29,540
oh definitely yeah and I'm waiting for Zapdos because it's the only one of the

1646
02:09:29,540 --> 02:09:35,300
birds yes the only one I don't have so I really want to complete my pokey decks

1647
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:41,060
at least without the regionals so yeah it's I'm really waiting for that and

1648
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:46,300
also I've been doing my missions every day and I have that in yeah also every

1649
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:50,940
single moltres even though they don't they kind of suck with IVs and all that

1650
02:09:50,940 --> 02:09:55,620
stuff but yeah I really don't care that much but let's still yeah it's more

1651
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:58,900
about the pokey decks than it is necessarily having the strongest Pokemon

1652
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:03,020
I'm totally with you like I would love to see them put the regionals like I

1653
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:06,780
would love to see you know as they're expanding into gen 3 for you know at

1654
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:10,140
some point they're gonna put more region lock stuff in those gens so you know

1655
02:10:10,140 --> 02:10:14,820
what it's time to go back to gen 1 and do some quest rewards that give us mr.

1656
02:10:14,820 --> 02:10:18,600
mime and Kangaskhan and the things we don't have yet you know let the other

1657
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:21,900
countries get taro's and so forth it would be that would be great I'd love

1658
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:27,860
that yeah me too don't know if you have heard about the earth date thing they

1659
02:10:27,860 --> 02:10:32,120
did oh yeah I heard that was that was happening did did the results come in

1660
02:10:32,120 --> 02:10:37,300
for that I don't know actually I was gonna ask you if you know if you knew

1661
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:42,860
anything about it because it was rumored that if the goal was reached we could

1662
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:48,700
have maybe got get Kangaskhan or maybe mr. mime for for unlock oh like maybe

1663
02:10:48,700 --> 02:10:52,860
that's gonna be the incentive or whatever is doing the earth day stuff I

1664
02:10:52,860 --> 02:10:56,420
don't know I'm checking the still road read it and I haven't seen anything

1665
02:10:56,420 --> 02:11:00,020
about it yet so I imagine they'll make they'll make it now so we earth day

1666
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:03,740
progress is there any way to track the progress of the earth day goals haven't

1667
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:07,780
heard anything on their website every single event is full so realistically

1668
02:11:07,780 --> 02:11:11,600
they have to unlock the top set of rewards within 48 of hours of the event

1669
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:16,740
ending so some places didn't have anything organized when the trainers got

1670
02:11:16,740 --> 02:11:24,580
there oh so who knows we'll see I guess we'll find out maybe tomorrow when the

1671
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:31,140
workday starts Niantic will put out a tweet now hopefully yeah all right

1672
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:33,740
awesome well if there's nothing else act-deaf I think I'll go ahead and let

1673
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:38,860
you go anything else you want to talk about no that was it all right sounds

1674

good buddy I'm gonna let you go have a good day okay you too all right bye

1675
02:11:42,460 --> 02:11:46,660
orange launch radio all one word on Skype if you want to get in anybody else

1676
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:50,180
with last-minute stories or anything they want to talk about I'm having the

1677
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:59,260
worst time in the universe finding a Tron shirt a Tron shirt yep is there a

1678
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:03,500
way you could get one from Shanghai Disney because they have the Tron ride

1679
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:06,940
there so I imagine they've got merch to go with it I'm looking for something to

1680
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:13,060
Disney bound and I found the Hurley dress I'm being resold but it's not Tron

1681
02:12:13,060 --> 02:12:18,900
enough yeah so I bet I was thinking I mean the whole reason this comes up is

1682
02:12:18,940 --> 02:12:23,220
because I have been on a Tron kick kind of to the point where I'm thinking about

1683
02:12:23,220 --> 02:12:30,460
playing Tron evolution again why not the Tron 360 game is or the 360 Tron is a

1684
02:12:30,460 --> 02:12:36,340
playable on Xbox one and don't have one well but they had it on ps3 and was it

1685
02:12:36,340 --> 02:12:42,100
on computer I think it was on PC at some point I don't know all right let's see

1695
02:13:31,300 --> 02:13:37,100
of those Android Samsung phones I forget the near the particular model but that

1696
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:43,380
being said no I already know that Jill just of what's no sparkles can do play

02:13:51,660 --> 02:14:00,220
want to ask us say not talk tight here sorry what games outside of that Pokemon

1699
02:14:00,220 --> 02:14:08,140
you know go game can you recommend no for a small throne is concerned it's

1700
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:13,020
Android beast ingress and go on the green team but you will have to go

1701
02:14:13,020 --> 02:14:17,340
outside a lot for that game but that was designed for older phones other like

1702
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:21,780
serious answers for rage I am kind of serious that answer though but other

1703
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:27,700
suggestions for raging air for like what about your clicker games don't you love

1704
02:14:27,700 --> 02:14:32,180
your clicker games I played the office space one but it's just it's so blatant

1705
02:14:32,180 --> 02:14:35,700
with they're trying to get you to spend money type stuff I don't really know

1706
02:14:35,700 --> 02:14:40,460
like I used to play the card of Mario one a good suggestion from our chat over

1707
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:44,740
at live dog network calm act F suggests Super Mario run which is free to try

1708
02:14:44,740 --> 02:14:48,500
super hexagon I think that's a very good suggestion I think you have to pay for

1709
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:53,580
that one but it's like not even a dollar I think for that one let's see as far as

1710
02:14:53,580 --> 02:14:58,260
the mobile phone games go I know like there's a lot of ports of especially

1711
02:14:58,260 --> 02:15:01,460
like Square Enix stuff a lot of the old Final Fantasy games are available which

1712
02:15:01,460 --> 02:15:08,100
I think is pretty cool if you like music based games what like re raves plus is

1713
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:16,900
available so is why is the name escape me in the moment the the other god damn

1714
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:21,940
it the other neon FM that's the one try anything on neon FM you can get puzzle

1715
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:24,740
fighter why you still can even though they're taking that offline pretty soon

1716
02:15:24,740 --> 02:15:31,660
I know a very popular one is bejeweled in the various jeweled blitz and stuff

1717
02:15:31,660 --> 02:15:34,700
that they have there I don't know if this is on Android but if it is you

1718
02:15:34,700 --> 02:15:37,980
should get trap adventure that's one of those games that will drive you fucking

1719
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:41,540
crazy let's see going to chat over at live dot

1720
02:15:41,540 --> 02:15:46,060
fog network calm JD suggest there's a whole bunch of p-cross games Oh act F

1721
02:15:46,060 --> 02:15:49,660
suggests hearthstone that's a really good suggestion to you like magic the

1722
02:15:49,660 --> 02:15:53,980
gathering I think I think the best suggestion so far is hearthstone

1723
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:57,980
pop culture says injustice to that on mobile I guess it is on mobile phones

1724
02:15:57,980 --> 02:16:02,300
isn't I do remember seeing something about that and pop culture says there is

1725
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:07,260
a vogue league on injustice to that's pretty cool JD suggest Pokemon shuffle

1726
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:13,220
which is a match three type of game so lots of suggestions anything else here

02:17:14,300 --> 02:17:18,660
later than others because I know some what was in 2001 no but where there's a

1738
02:17:18,660 --> 02:17:21,500
picture of an actor somewhere that somebody took where the actor was still

1739
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:25,020
using a flip phone was it Daniel Day-Lewis always it was somebody got a

1740
02:17:25,020 --> 02:17:27,980
picture like Daniel Day-Lewis on the subway and he was still using a flip

1741
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:31,220
phone and that was like that that's why the tweet went viral because like oh my
