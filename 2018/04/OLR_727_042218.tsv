0	27000	This week Microsoft's continued expansion of their avatar system was inadvertently leaked revealing changes allowing a more detailed embodiment of yourself or a person of your own design. That's just one story to come. Join us for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	56000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio prepped for takeoff tonight on episode 727 of our show. For tonight, April the 22nd of 2018, my name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio every week, every single stinking week except the week she doesn't say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
57000	58000	Hi, how are you?
58000	59000	I'm alive.
59000	65000	Good. I'm glad to hear that. You were telling me a little bit about you had a spa day yesterday with one of our lady friends from the DDR days.
65000	87000	Yes. People from those days may know her as DNL Dreams. It was Renee. I met up at her house and we went into San Francisco and went to the Pearl Spa in Japantown. It's a Korean run business and I don't know too much about bathroom rituals for Korea so I don't know if it's the same thing.
87000	102000	But it felt very like a Japanese bath to me where you go and you sit and you clean first and then you can have a hot tub or a cold tub. And so it was really nice. Lots of good soaking. They had a sauna, which I'm not too fond of saunas, and a steam room that was out of order.
102000	116000	But then upstairs they had two other sauna rooms that had like a clay bed that you lay in, like clay balls, red clay balls, and a Himalayan salt room. And they did sheet masks. And I was like, oh, sheet masks. And they gave me two, which I brought for your significant other.
116000	117000	Oh, there you go.
117000	132000	And because I have a bunch. And then I had like a full body exfoliating scrub. I got over any body shyness I had really quick because you do go in there naked. It's very like that.
132000	135000	Okay. But like women go to the bathroom together, so whatever.
135000	149000	It was scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, all the scrubbing, hot water. And the hot water felt great, but it was surprisingly hot just to have it splashed on me. And like just tons of skin came off. And now I've got baby skin. I keep petting my arm because I don't know who this is anymore.
149000	153000	And like almost all my calluses are gone. It's amazing.
154000	167000	That actually sounds fun. I would do something like that. Now, not to like give away my home address on air, but a somewhat reasonable distance here from OLR headquarters. There used to be a men's only Korean spa, like not that far from here.
167000	168000	This was women's only.
168000	175000	Right. So but this men's only one. I have I am aware that some CD. It is not just.
175000	176000	It's that kind of bathhouse.
176000	178000	Yeah, it's like the one in Berkeley.
178000	180000	It's not just like massage.
180000	182000	I've learned a lot about bathhouses lately.
182000	190000	Yeah. Yeah. So and no, I don't know this firsthand. You pervs. I just I've heard things. There was a bathroom stalls.
190000	197000	There was supposed to be a cento like a Japanese style full bath, you know, split men and women's just outside of Sacramento.
197000	207000	And I think it closed down because it was when I was looking for places because it's like, where am I going to find outside of San Francisco or that infamous male bathhouse in Berkeley?
207000	209000	What's basically hookup bathhouse?
209000	211000	I didn't even tell you the punchline of this whole thing.
211000	215000	No, it's fine. The the the thing closed. It's gone.
215000	220000	And in its place is the same name, Burger and Shake.
220000	225000	So it's like the family must have decided, maybe this business.
225000	228000	So but now it's going to be Burger and Shake.
228000	232000	So I can just see one of these days, Loki's going to bring a bill bag, a burger and shakes in this place.
232000	235000	And maybe like, do you know what used to happen there?
235000	239000	Oh, it still happens there, too.
239000	241000	So you get your burger and your shake on.
241000	245000	Burger and shake wink.
245000	247000	How are you doing, Techmaster Loki?
247000	248000	I'm doing fine.
248000	250000	Good, good. Full of breadsticks, I see.
250000	251000	Full of breadsticks.
251000	254000	Good. A very breakfast of champions and dinner, too.
254000	256000	Yep. All three meals, pretty much.
256000	258000	Yeah. How's how's your week been?
258000	262000	I saw I saw some pictures on the old book of faces over at Old Town.
262000	265000	So you must have taken the fam out for a play day.
265000	273000	Yeah. The kids wanted to go on the light rail to Old Sacramento, to the railroad museum.
273000	277000	Sadly, we got to light rail station right as the light rail came and we missed it.
277000	280000	So we just drove down there anyways, which is probably better anyways.
280000	283000	Who wants to sell light rail train for 30 minutes?
283000	284000	Especially with the kids.
284000	287000	They wanted to because they thought it'd be exciting.
287000	290000	But we instead we went on like the steam train that they have there.
290000	291000	Oh, that's cool.
291000	296000	Had dinner and I played lots of Pokemon Go and even on the steam train, which is great because it doesn't go very fast.
296000	298000	I hit all the focus apps along the way.
298000	299000	Brilliant. Brilliant.
299000	304000	Did you did you see that shop that has the classic arcade games in the back?
304000	305000	No.
305000	306000	Oh, it's not far from where those trains are.
306000	312000	There's a little there's a shop and it's like a it's like a kitsch, knickknack type of shop.
312000	315000	But in the back, they have a bunch of like 80s arcade games.
315000	319000	They want like 50 cents a play, though, to play shit like Defender and Joust.
319000	321000	And they have them. There's like the second candy.
321000	327000	So there's like the candy heaven, which is like there's like four candy barrel stores and there's like two sock stores.
327000	331000	Like who who gets them? Like who shops for socks?
331000	334000	Alan. Alan loves fun socks. Yeah.
334000	336000	Jamie, I thought this was the thing you'd like to.
336000	338000	I really like socks, but they have to be well-made socks.
338000	340000	So I won't buy funny socks if they're not well-made.
340000	344000	I do. I do like I like cute socks and I don't care how they're made.
344000	348000	J.D., who comes on the show once in a while, he's in our chat now and he'll be here next week.
348000	350000	He got me this really cute pair of Jigglypuff socks.
350000	352000	So, you know, for when I play Pokemon Go.
352000	355000	And when I was at the mall not that long ago, I got Bob Ross socks.
355000	360000	They're super cute. So, OK, well, apparently everybody's more in the socks than I was aware.
360000	365000	But anyways, so they used to have like I remember that because we were walking by some of the stores and like,
365000	368000	oh, yeah, that's where the Nickel Arcade used to be.
368000	373000	But like I remember that second candy store and I know there's probably dozens of other ones,
373000	376000	but the second one that's kind of in the corner there,
376000	380000	they had like classic arcade games in the back too at the time.
380000	381000	Oh, that's random.
381000	386000	But they don't anymore and no one's in there because, you know, everyone's at the other candy store, which is way better.
388000	389000	Oh, poor guys. All right.
389000	395000	I do want to say hello to our chat room where we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network,
395000	400000	vog network dot com at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
400000	402000	But a programming note, Bobby, he was here tonight.
402000	405000	He's going to be gone for the next couple of weeks, but we will still be here.
405000	407000	We don't have any shows off till the end of June.
407000	411000	So we'll be here for the next few weeks, again, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.
411000	415000	And if you are listening live, you can join us in our chat room at live dot vog network dot com.
415000	420000	All those chat issues from last week, they were resolved in the middle of the week.
420000	425000	Essentially, it was explained to me the same way it was explained that the Oculus Rift,
425000	429000	remember when their website just kind of stopped because the security certificate was bad?
429000	431000	That's kind of what happened to our chat last week.
431000	434000	So there was nothing we could do about it during the show.
434000	437000	But the issue magically fixed itself in the middle of the week.
437000	443000	Bobby as a fail safe also put some other like alternative links there if that happens again.
443000	447000	So sorry about last week, guys, but shit happens.
447000	450000	So well, but we made it through a show last week.
450000	451000	It was a fun show last week.
451000	456000	And it'll be a fun show tonight, too, with more folks in our chat over at live dot vog network dot com.
456000	459000	And Bobby Black Wolf actually starts us off.
459000	460000	He sends a link.
460000	465000	But he said, did somebody say gaming socks and pointed out these are the socks I wore at my wedding?
465000	470000	And they're actually Katamari Damacy socks, which to go with the cake that Bobby had at his wedding.
470000	477000	See, see now, Loki, can you see why we like socks when it's things like this, like the king of all cosmos?
477000	478000	I do, though.
478000	484000	I tell you, I find cute socks at Daiso sometimes and I will buy them because they're pile socks,
484000	489000	not just a tweet, you know, to give Daiso some business because Daiso is big and all over the world.
489000	493000	But their socks are really well made and I ruin socks.
493000	496000	These I've had for a year and they're still not ruined.
496000	498000	My stripey socks from Daiso.
498000	499000	Bobby wants to clarify in chat.
499000	503000	He didn't know about the cake and the socks were a gift from the best man.
503000	505000	So the best man was in on this thing.
505000	508000	Maybe. Or it's all just a wonderful coincidence.
508000	511000	So it works. It works.
511000	516000	Sia Tabiri in our chat also points out that socks was the number one Clinton kitty.
517000	522000	Well, yeah, but socks ended up being given away when they got a dog.
522000	523000	Oh, I forgot about that.
523000	527000	Yeah. And the ladies had socks until until socks died.
527000	532000	But we need another president with a cat instead of, you know, this anti-Semitic tweeting shithole that we have.
532000	536000	I should be president if for no other reason than Mr. Smoosh could be first cat.
536000	540000	I mean, well, I should be president.
540000	543000	Well, you well, I should be president.
543000	545000	Well, I'm actually of legal age to be president.
545000	548000	So am I. So, yeah, you did.
548000	550000	Yes. Yes. Look, Jamie lies to people.
550000	553000	Why would you vote for her?
553000	556000	We should co-preside. We'll just take turns.
556000	561000	You can be. Well, you're more qualified than the current secretary of education.
561000	563000	So why don't you try to roll through?
563000	565000	I actually went to public school.
565000	568000	All right. Anyway, it's not a politics show. It's a gaming show.
568000	571000	Let's get into some gaming news. Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.
572000	576000	Oh, boy. Get your tea, because this is going to be a rough patch.
576000	579000	Hey, let's talk about Mass Effect Andromeda, dark soccer.
579000	582000	Why don't we talk a little bit about that and drama.
582000	586000	Yeah. And with it, shall I begin my my bitter tears?
586000	596000	Hold hold them for a minute, because just in case some folks weren't aware, there was a blog that was posted this week by the general manager of Bioware, Casey Hudson, who is the what?
596000	600000	He's the on again off again employee over Bioware. He's on right now.
600000	605000	And he mentioned in this blog post Mass Effect Andromeda wasn't going to be getting DLC.
605000	618000	We already knew that. But he talked about kind of like what went on behind the scenes, that it was kind of like shocking to them, I guess, because they mentioned, you know, we all know the Korean arc was the thing that was going to happen supposedly at one point in the story.
618000	621000	They're satisfying this through a book or something now, a comic book. I don't know.
621000	623000	I stopped caring because I'm so mad about it.
623000	628000	But anyway, Casey Hudson in the blog post called this a defining moment for Bioware.
628000	637000	So the moment they found out they weren't going to do DLC that EA, I guess, had pretty much pulled the plug on Mass Effect Andromeda, which was their own fucking fault to begin with.
637000	643000	But anyway, they decided that they weren't going to do the DLC and Bioware called this a defining moment.
644000	653000	So we need to delight players with new experiences and innovations, says Hudson, but we must stay focused on the importance of our world, character and storytelling elements that players expect from our games.
653000	663000	And our games must be designed to continue delivering new stories and experiences in an ongoing relationship with players within the worlds we're evolving together.
663000	671000	So he mentioned about Anthem, the world, story and character will be available to experience in co-op in an ongoing series of adventures.
671000	677000	Anthem will be unlike anything you've played, but if we do it right, it will be very distinctively Bioware.
677000	681000	And I'm at the point where this game can go fuck itself.
681000	686000	And I hate to say that because I know there are lots of people that are working very hard on this game.
686000	691000	And this is not about any of those programmers or any of those people that are just trying to make a living and do a job.
691000	695000	And I feel very, very bad that I'm having to talk so negatively about Anthem.
695000	700000	The fault is not with you guys. It is very clear it is at the executive level. It always has been.
700000	703000	And it's at a level where it's EA's fucking fault.
703000	707000	And I don't care about Anthem.
707000	715000	Bioware, I'm not sure Bioware realizes how badly they've alienated people with this whole debacle.
715000	721000	And the people that they want to be supporting Anthem, a lot of the people that have supported Dragon Age and Mass Effect.
721000	728000	And to be all like, well, since the DLC model or whatever didn't work, we're going to have to go to co-op, co-op, co-op.
728000	758000	Games as a service, herpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderpaderp
788000	791600	violence that's happened in some of the previous series and kind of like some of
791600	794880	the ethical questions about that stuff apparently God of War is kind of this new
794880	799040	ones chewing on it kind of makes me go shit I think I might I think I might pick
799040	802120	this up like I kind of want to play this new God of War game the more and more I
802120	806920	hear about it the more I see about it so don't fucking sit there and tell me EA
806920	812160	Bioware that there's no room for single-player experiences like like
812160	816120	continue to show me that you're continuing to make bad decisions Bioware
816120	819200	Bioware is gonna be gone in the next couple years you're not gonna get a new
819200	822840	dragon yeah they're they're the next company on the chopping block that EA is
822840	827960	gonna absorb in and just destroy I hate I hate saying this I hate being negative
827960	831800	you know I am NOT negative when it comes to games but it's these fucking
831800	836020	decisions that happen at such a high level that made me so angry and I would
836020	839760	guess a lot of the things that make us you know angry gamers and stuff is
839760	843540	usually the fault of some type of executive decision hell a lot of the
843540	847540	stuff that usually even Loki gets on his horse with Nintendo about it's
847540	850140	usually some type of decision at the very very top gotta keep those
850140	853860	shareholders happy we're angry when we love it Jamie I know you want to spill
853860	858020	some tea what was what was your reaction to hearing all this fuck them I've been
858020	862380	fuck them since anthem was announced but why I mean like because remember there's
862380	866540	gonna be people listening to this that are like olr they're just more angry
866540	870460	jaded angry I thought it looked cool I thought anthem look cool but then again
870700	877100	I know it looks cool it's all the bullshit that's in the back end that is
877100	881940	gonna drive me away from it right it's just that I really was into Mass Effect
881940	885780	Andromeda story I really enjoyed it I want to find out what happened to the
885780	889580	quarry ins I want it in without reading a book about I love books mind you and
889580	895200	I'll probably read the book but I wanted more and there was an even now knowing
895200	900420	there was more and they're not giving it to us fuck them all over this fucking
900420	905340	stupid piece of shit game that they don't think they think they know what we
905340	909620	want without fucking asking us what the fuck we want that's bingo that that's it
909620	913700	there's the tea right there they think they know what we want without asking us
913700	918340	what we want so fuck them that's and that's what I fucking need EA to do here
918340	924580	I need EA to come out and take some fucking accountability EA not Bioware
924580	929220	don't fucking send Casey Hudson to do it EA you come out and take some
929220	933460	accountability for why Mass Effect Andromeda flocked it in flock because of
933460	937660	the flop because the fans it flop because of you they never will look at
937660	941780	Star Wars they're never gonna do that it's never ever gonna happen so that's
941780	946560	why anthem can go fuck itself I already why I'm angry I'm ready to start like a
946560	952180	boycott EA hashtag well I mean I'm ready to have been there yeah no offense but

1058940	1063980	introduced Bobby Blackwell says we say we want single-player but our actions
1063980	1068220	show all multiplayer and battle royale you don't see God of War being the top
1068220	1072780	game on twitch but as the top game I mean maybe part of the reason people
1072780	1075500	don't want to watch single-player stuff on twitch all the time is because they
1075500	1080700	don't want the story spoiled so is twitch rankings really the best way to
1080700	1085380	evaluate that I mean it should be just sales if this God of War game if
1085380	1089460	horizon's yield zero dawn are selling millions and millions of copies which I
1089460	1094740	don't see how I'm sure horizon zero dawn did very well yeah because Sony doesn't
1094740	1098820	stop talking about it they did the expansion for it good for them but also
1098820	1102460	we got God of War I'm sure of course this game is gonna do well how does God
1102460	1105100	of War not end up selling like all the other games that they've been I mean
1105100	1112420	they had until dawn they had and I know there's more in it got Detroit coming up
1112420	1116740	Detroit yes which is that's not a Sony it's a Sony exclusive but it's the last
1116740	1122780	of us okay there you go last of us yeah uncharted I mean they kind of rock the
1122780	1126580	single-player yeah sure they put some multiplayer in there and then I have no
1126580	1130780	problem with them putting multiplayer stuff in there in as well Mass Effect
1130780	1135540	3 was rad which is why and we're gonna get into a layer which is why when I
1135540	1139420	hear this oh well we're not including a certain portion of the game that makes
1139420	1143460	me think yeah but you're still asking me to pay $60 for your game so you're
1143460	1147740	telling me oh we're giving you half a game but pay us the full full money and
1147740	1154380	then some in a season pass let's see Dungeon Buster and chat kind of following
1154380	1158260	up on that to be fair some games are great to watch on Twitch others are just
1158260	1161900	damn boring unless the broadcaster is really entertaining which really isn't a
1161900	1166820	good judge of what people are playing though really mm-hmm you know cuz it's
1166820	1170300	just like you said people don't always want to see stories spoiled right you
1170300	1175420	know and sometimes you know you're in a single-player game and like I'll do
1175420	1179100	Dragon Age from time to time but I'll stop because I'm into the game you know
1179100	1185540	right it's just not it's really not a good gauge Bobby Blackwolf and chat says
1185540	1189140	but you watch my Sierra games and a follow-up to that yeah but I and I know
1189140	1191900	you're saying that a little tongue-in-cheek but you know for one the
1191900	1195700	Sierra games are very very very old it's like one of those things where it's like
1195700	1201020	spoiler alert I'm going to spoil the Star Wars series okay Darth Vader's
1201020	1205180	Luke's father what like you can't really spoil something that's been out for like
1205180	1212420	30 years right so the boat sinks at the end of Titanic oh my god you know so
1212420	1218740	anyway with that whole thing people watch Bobby stream because it's Bobby
1218740	1222860	it's like it's kind of like you said you only watch me play Ni No Kuni 2 because
1222860	1227820	it's me I don't think you are as into Ni No Kuni 2 sometimes the personality
1227820	1232780	carries it a lot further there you go and phantasm chat straight up says I
1232780	1238100	like to play not watch phantasm out of curiosity if you play through a
1238100	1241820	single-player game or any game will you maybe watch somebody play it after the
1241820	1245300	fact because I've done that before like I've played through a single-player game
1245300	1248280	like let's say Final Fantasy 15 or something and then I've gone back and
1248280	1251220	watched other people play it just to kind of see like how they're gonna react
1251220	1255820	to the story I know that was a big thing with Until Dawn I know Shane and I had a
1255820	1259460	conversation about this once because he was super into that game and he loved to
1259460	1263540	watch twitch streamers play Until Dawn because he wanted to see how they would
1263540	1268220	react to all the scares and all the you know multiple branching paths to yeah
1268220	1273340	that's true too for sure and dungeon buster kind of follows up on that too
1273340	1277500	says actually I'll admit I do like watching some RPGs that I've played
1277500	1281820	already just to see the reactions to certain scenes for sure and even
1281820	1286180	something ironically like Mass Effect sometimes they're gonna make story
1286180	1289420	choices that were different than what you did and so it's kind of like you get
1289420	1292060	to see a different side of the game like oh that's what happens if you pick
1292060	1295820	that option I didn't know because when I played through it it was this option you
1295820	1299940	know so I don't know there's there's some reasons I like to watch that stuff
1299940	1307020	but anyway I don't know at this point if EA isn't gonna put out any type of
1307020	1311500	apology for you know basically or accountability for what they did a Mass
1311500	1317780	Effect Andromeda which I don't expect them to do I hard pass on anthem or
1317780	1322980	really any big-budget EA title I'm not really ready to completely maybe write
1322980	1326020	off everything because I also know there's some indie things that the only
1326020	1329900	way they kind of get out is through the EA support like what was the unravel
1329900	1335100	that wasn't was that Ubisoft or was that EA oh yeah so I don't know I don't know
1335100	1340820	well they also just have that was escape plan I think it was called hmm that was
1340820	1347340	pretty good but at least as far as anthem specifically pass I'm I'm not
1347380	1351540	seeing past yet until I see what the game is but I have a feeling it's gonna
1351540	1356820	be like destiny and I will judge honestly I'm not into the whole concept
1356820	1362740	of destiny really I've been burned by destiny twice now so yeah I still never
1362740	1371300	it's pretty I'll give it that yeah destiny 2 is pretty anyway let's move on
1371300	1375340	well I swear we are positive and stuff here on a well r2 it's just that was
1375340	1378020	something you get y'all know when a Bioware thing came up you had to you had
1378020	1380460	to know what Jamie was gonna say about what I was gonna say about it yeah fuck
1380460	1384220	them all right I'm not going to play anthem I'm not going to look at it I'm
1384220	1388940	not gonna support anything having to do with anthem I will forget anthem exists
1388940	1394500	in my internal universe you have had it officially I'm done with EA it's okay
1394500	1397780	though cuz if you pre-order from GameStop I'm sure you'll get an n7 skin
1397780	1402340	for your whatever you're calling no that not even that offensive like that's
1402340	1408500	really offensive it is but you watch they haven't announced anything yet I
1408500	1412340	know I'm willing to bet that that shit is gonna know thing did lure in the mass
1412340	1418460	I will say this I did participate in the Bioware clearance sale when since
1418460	1423220	they're changing their storefronts mm-hmm because I finally replaced like
1423220	1427660	the shirt that I wore holes in mm-hmm and I did it for five bucks
1427660	1431700	L more chart in our chat I hope I said that right I think that's a newer name
1431700	1437020	so hi and welcome it says there are very very few games I'll fork out $60 now
1437020	1441860	thanks to shenanigans like Andromeda last straw kind of thing oh certainly
1441860	1445660	when it comes to EA and the $60 price tag you betcha I have reservations about
1445660	1449860	that but you know other other it other companies it really depends Blizzard
1449860	1453740	you know if Blizzard were to say we're gonna do an overwatch expansion it's
1453740	1458700	gonna be you know $49.99 or something I if they go like it's single-player I'll
1458700	1462460	be like I'm in your PVE or whatever I'll be I'm in you know like certain
1462460	1465860	companies can kind of get away with it like Blizzard you know I'm willing to
1465860	1469700	pay a high price tag for their games cuz is there a bad Blizzard game I don't
1469700	1474420	think there is so there have been some bad expansions there well and there have
1474420	1479140	been games I don't prefer to other games like Starcraft I don't prefer I'm not a
1479140	1482820	Starcraft fan and I I want to get my game playing Diablo but I still look at
1482820	1487180	Starcraft and I go it is a good game it's just not my game yeah it's kind of
1487180	1490020	like that similar thing I have a God of War and that whole series I never really
1490020	1494460	got into God of War doesn't mean I don't like it I just you know I am one gamer
1494460	1498780	with a day job that has nothing to do with OLR you know I can only play
1498780	1501740	somebody by the time I come home I'll be honest because most of the playing I do
1501740	1506620	is on my computer mm-hmm I don't want to look at a computer all day for my job
1506620	1512220	and I don't want to look at another one you know maybe I'll have a stream day
1512220	1516100	maybe it'll just be me fucking around and Wow I don't know there you go
1516100	1521620	Mega Man x400 one of my good speaking of streaming one of my streamer pals in
1521620	1525380	chat says that would be pretty fucking rude if they put an n7 skin and anthem
1525380	1528700	yes it would I'm glad I'm glad we're not a matter of time and we'll be saying it
1528700	1533980	told you so but I know I know all right positivity happy experiences good things
1533980	1538620	games are awesome or we wouldn't do this show it's this is all this other stuff
1538620	1541900	the video game business is what sucks sometimes but video games themselves
1541900	1545220	fucking awesome let's talk about some fucking awesome things we played this
1545220	1548900	week our soccer I'm sorry I was looking my bullet journal that's okay how was
1548900	1553860	your gaming week oh god I didn't really I guess play a whole lot again it's been
1553860	1557660	a really crazy week because I'm trying to I've got two weeks now before drag
1557660	1563180	con and I'm trying to get a lot of my stuff together however I had started
1563180	1567620	firewatch and finally I just like I'm tired of being at my computer so Dan and
1567620	1570420	I just watched the rest of the game because honestly it's kind of the same
1570420	1573700	thing and so I really I really liked firewatch and I'm probably gonna go
1573700	1579980	finish it maybe I'll stream that other than that it's been Pokemon go it's been
1579980	1587380	idol pouring it's been actually playing some some puyo puyo because I love my
1587380	1591500	puyo puyo and I'm kind of in the mood for puyo puyo that is fun to say it's
1591500	1598300	not puyo it's not a it's not a chicken el puyo loco puyo puyo no it's it's
1598300	1609780	puyo puyo yes just playing the general stuff like that I've got I've got drag
1609780	1614620	con to get ready for all right conventions they're hard work yeah well
1614620	1618740	that and I still haven't decided if I'm doing Shirley Manson styled girl drag
1618740	1622260	for the 90s huh or if I'm just gonna do sister face the whole time well it
1622260	1625620	sounds like you've managed to fit in a few games here and there so yeah I mean
1625620	1630260	I play when I can I'm also finishing up a book okay all right well let's move
1630260	1633140	over to Loki how was your gaming week how many and play a whole ton of stuff
1633140	1637860	nothing really on console just because my wife's been watching all of the shows
1637860	1643260	on TV like literally all of them so I haven't been able to play any consoles
1643260	1647220	and I've really man when I picked up our cry 5 I really should have gotten it on
1647220	1656380	PC but I didn't know well whatever um so I played them Pokemon go quite a bit
1656380	1660020	this weekend just because I was out where there's pokey stops and I was
1660020	1667700	trying to gear up basically I played a little tiny bit of ingress just in
1667700	1673260	between waiting for stuff to respond and Pokemon go and a little bit of the
1673260	1677580	office space game which I don't even know why I still play that fucking thing
1677580	1684660	I swear to God it's just stupid that's pretty much it sadly um wow I hate to
1684660	1689500	kind of have a slow gaming week across the board but I didn't play a lot of new
1689500	1694260	stuff but I still played a lot of the existing stuff still been playing um the
1694260	1701900	name is gay I can't always say the be mania 2dx but it's not 2dx yes DJ max
1701940	1705180	respect I've still been playing DJ max respect I'm still trying to clear all
1705180	1708740	the songs in six button mode so I've been playing that I've been playing a
1708740	1712460	little bit on Xbox actually because that is now the cons because I moved the
1712460	1716940	PlayStation 4 to the office so I can do more streaming from it the Xbox one is
1716940	1720200	now kind of my console that's hooked up to the TV and you know okay I had the
1720200	1724700	weirdest problem with my Xbox one for the longest time like the fan that it
1724700	1728420	was hooked up to it would make a lot of noise like it was very like but like
1728420	1734300	they did some recent update and like that stopped I don't know like can a can
1734300	1738500	a patch like change the hardware like that like well they could probably maybe
1738500	1742300	change the firmware kicks on could be a firmware update that's pretty cool that
1742300	1745820	they finally like change that cuz well my Xbox is quiet and I leave it plugged
1745820	1751460	in a lot well I mean it actually is your your fans will usually kick on when
1751460	1755980	you've got you know an excess of heat running on your computer if it changes
1755980	1760060	the way the heat is detected or the power management system then certainly
1760060	1763100	the fans wouldn't kick on so much I mean the same thing can happen like I'll use
1763100	1766620	a Mac for an example you've got your fans running kind of high you can do an
1766620	1770700	SMC reset and sometimes it will keep the fans from running like they were even
1770700	1773860	when my Xbox one was powered off you would still hear the power brick going
1773860	1779580	oh yeah it has to cool down yeah so it was it was so they fixed it somehow so
1779580	1785300	cool with that but let's see so stuff I've been playing though so I did
1785340	1788100	actually okay so here's the crazy thing you guys are gonna think this is so
1788100	1793060	weird I did get super I've probably played like for four hours this week one
1793060	1796860	game that I haven't played in a long time you ready for this especially you
1796860	1802300	Loki you ready I played a lot of minecraft this week why did you say
1802300	1806700	anything I would have totally played with you yeah no and it's not like it's
1806700	1811580	the windows 10 minecraft yeah I didn't I did not realize they've changed so much
1811580	1818220	yes so much is changing but doesn't it run so good it runs so good and plus
1818220	1822900	like when did they make it so that like the PC version doesn't have the manual
1822900	1826540	crafting anymore you just go into that big recipe book and it's just like
1826540	1829980	anything you want to make and you can see exactly what you need to make it not
1829980	1835060	too long ago they still have that what quality of life awesome shit is this so
1835060	1838140	like it kind of made me excited about minecraft again so I just started
1838140	1843540	playing now I don't think I have the best world because you know you can put
1843540	1847020	in a seed and you can get whatever world you want so of course the seed that I
1847020	1852580	used was Miss Vangie and that's the seed I used to do this world but spoiler
1852580	1856100	alert Miss Vangie's world kind of starts you in the middle of all these sand
1856100	1860740	dunes which isn't the most exciting place to start at least if I roll a
1860740	1864400	world named Miss Vangie and you roll a world name is all the same it's all the
1864400	1868400	same but you have to do like I did with a capital M capital V right if you did
1868400	1871060	lowercase and lowercase V to you to completely it would be completely okay
1871060	1874400	so maybe if you and I decide to play together we'll start on a different
1874400	1878040	world that's like just just Vangie or something we'll do something like that
1878040	1882560	yeah all right there you go you could just do Vanessa Vangie Mateo and what
1882560	1887960	you get or as in our chat suggest JD suggests Miss Vangie with five A's Miss
1888600	1896640	Vangie exactly okay so anyway um so yeah spoiler alert the Miss Vangie world not
1896640	1900240	so great so although it does seem like there's a lot of other biomes nearby
1900240	1904000	we're trying to get that achievement but and lots of there's lots of wildlife in
1904000	1907600	the starting area like finding the sheep to get the wool that was really easy
1907600	1912180	because I forgot like man trying to make a bed really sucks and like the thing
1912180	1915640	that's like the toughest thing about Minecraft I think is like try well
1915640	1919960	because I play in survival mode I play easy survival yeah because I want there
1919960	1924760	to be a point and although don't get me wrong like I love the shit I see in
1924760	1928120	creative mode I love how people basically use minecraft as like virtual
1928120	1934120	Legos I love that stuff but like that's not for I'm not as artistic so that mode
1934120	1937600	doesn't speak to me as much as like survival mode where it's like there is a
1937600	1942080	game the game is to survive and not get killed by creepers and stuff I get more
1942080	1946560	thrill out of that so but the hardest part is that you have to build a house
1946560	1952000	in the first like ten minutes because if you don't then when the monsters come
1952000	1955720	out like they're gonna be skeletons and spiders and creepers and shit that spawn
1955720	1959880	right by your house but like trying to get a bed for your house that's hard
1959880	1963180	because you've got to find like what three pieces of wool which means you
1963180	1966080	have to basically kill sheep because you're not gonna get shears that fast
1966080	1970080	which when did they put shears in Minecraft that was something I was like
1970080	1975040	that's been in the since the Xbox 360 really yeah I missed the boat on that
1975040	1978920	somehow so anyway it's just faster just to kill them so it doesn't matter I
1978920	1983000	guess I guess so anyway without going on and on about a game that's years and
1983000	1986280	years old I've been rediscovering minecraft so if you haven't played
1986280	1991140	minecraft in like two years I would say fire it up and see what's changed cuz
1991140	1994920	you know it felt like kind of a new game to me in many ways so that was really
1994920	1999600	cool so anyway so yeah we need to we need to do a multiplayer that would be
1999600	2003560	really fun cuz I you it's all through the realms thing now right well realms
2003560	2007400	are like the servers so if you keep a serve you want like a server to keep
2007400	2012240	going huh you pay for realms and then people can log into that but it's like
2012240	2018280	very limited the amount of people can connect at a time but you can just do
2018280	2023960	multiplayer also okay that's cool now with the realms can I play on PC and
2023960	2033720	somebody on Xbox one can yep thing Oh Xbox one the switch phone VR oh that's
2033720	2037680	something we didn't have before when we had the vog server before it was all PC
2037680	2042320	yeah oh you making me think maybe we need to need to check out a realm for 30
2042320	2046640	days and see what happens okay all right all right I think I think that might be
2046640	2050800	a thing we do and then we play in the official vog network but I'm still using
2050800	2055520	Vangie as a seed well realm yeah I mean you could just do it like survival
2055520	2060600	okay create creative was fun but like I don't know it like it almost it like
2060600	2063520	defeats the point and it was fun like with mods and stuff on there but you
2063520	2070200	can't really do that so much anymore you can pay for like they have like skins I
2070200	2073280	guess you can pay for like they kind of skin up everything and change a little
2073280	2077640	bit of this stuff but I don't know okay Bobby and chat says wait till I get back
2077760	2081440	so maybe that's gonna be a thing all right in a couple weeks so all right
2081440	2084880	sounds good and that that gives our listeners time to prepare themselves and
2084880	2092000	go rediscover minecraft so we'll be we'll be working on that all right Bobby
2092000	2095320	Blackwell says I have the Xbox one version which has parity with Windows
2095320	2099280	10 see I had I I knew that they had like the crossplay but I didn't really I kind
2099280	2102400	of thought like I wonder if the realms is how they title that together so that
2102400	2107400	you don't have to yeah real realers anymore realms are just one of that
2107800	2111360	servers paying for realms basically or that you were paying for servers
2111360	2115000	Microsoft one of them well it's also to make it easier because you know setting
2115000	2120320	up a server right server is kind of it can be a little bit of a pain and they
2120320	2124000	still have like the PC PC version if you want to do that you know the Java
2124000	2128320	version if you want to still run the servers and everything but they do have
2128320	2131280	realms now they're a little bit better so the only people excluded are
2131280	2136720	PlayStation 4 and Vita from that but that's Sony's fault that's not yeah okay
2137040	2141360	all right well and probably the X you know obviously the older systems ps3 and
2141360	2146000	360 right because those haven't updated but like switch I think is gonna be
2146000	2150120	getting it soon I don't have their update yet but then there we talked about
2150120	2153820	last week the new updates gonna have the Xbox actually last week talking about it
2153820	2157840	and then seeing it on the Nintendo switch store I almost bought it on the
2157840	2162320	switch and I was like it's 30 bucks I was like you know I have it on PC hello
2162320	2166280	let me go let me go revisit it on PC so I did and that's when I started
2166280	2169520	discovering like when the fuck did they change all this so there's a lot I've
2169520	2173320	been played in months so it's like every time I go back I'm like what is all this
2173320	2178960	shit right it's all new anyway so I could dust off mine all right okay I've
2178960	2183320	also though I actually every so often like if I'm bored at work during my
2183320	2187160	lunch or something I'll play on my Mac okay I'll never call it out for my
2187160	2191800	gaming time but okay I play on a Mac all right I don't know if the Mac versions
2191800	2195760	the same as like the Windows 10 I don't care I just play creative anyway because
2195760	2201280	I dig holes all right anyway I didn't mean to turn my entire segment into a
2201280	2204200	Minecraft thing but hey it is it is probably the game I played more than
2204200	2208200	anything else this week so but I think I think I might start over on a better
2208200	2213000	seed just because yeah the Miss Vangie didn't work out so well as to see I
2213000	2215480	don't know if you guys if you guys you know maybe we can make it the Vangie
2215480	2222240	challenge if you want to play on Miss Vangie as a seed and tell me where the
2222240	2228760	fucking redstone is cuz I can barely find iron okay so it's just like getting
2228760	2231600	into the mines like I mean I could just dig a hole in the floor and get in the
2231600	2234320	mines that way but we all know that's not safe because you could dig a hole in
2234320	2239160	the floor and then you fall through your death right right well okay yeah you
2239160	2242440	could there you do it you do a gradual standing then of course now they have
2242440	2245160	also you know you still have the silverfish that end up in there and
2245160	2249600	that's a pain in the ass yeah Elmore chart in our chat says digging holes in
2249600	2253840	Minecraft is oddly satisfying that's that's the reward I get from it too like
2253840	2257800	all I've really done on Miss Vangie world right now is I've built like just
2257800	2260920	I did find a place to go underground that I kind of like and I've just built
2260920	2265520	this tunnel in wonder it's just a giant tunnel because I'm like at some point
2265520	2269680	I'm gonna tunnel into something good well you know what yet to happen you
2269680	2274440	know what my homes are like the house I had back on the old server it was this
2274440	2278200	underground network of tunnels like a big maze yeah and I knew how to get
2278200	2282760	through it but like the opening was like a glass shrine I the door I also
2282760	2286400	always forget like there is nothing wrong with setting up your home
2286400	2290560	underground you can set up an easy base underground you just have to dig
2290560	2293320	yourself the tiniest little hole with the door to bed and you can keep
2293320	2296800	yourself safe I like I tend to when I'm starting off just into the side of a
2296800	2302000	mountain because then oh that's smart to see I need to play smarter and do
2302000	2305600	something like that where I just build or if all else fails like the very
2305640	2308840	first times we used to play if all else fails you just run out of time you just
2308840	2316200	build a tower straight up and just wait it out I like that that's good not go go
2316200	2320480	underground be the dwarves were the dwarves knew something all right anyway
2320480	2325200	that's it for my gaming week let's get into some gaming news oh I'll quickly
2325200	2329000	say of course as always follow us on twitter twitter.com slash olr we're also
2329000	2334200	on facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and anything else I need to
2334200	2337280	shout out I don't think so I think we were ready to get into some news so
2337280	2344480	let's do it Loki start us off all right so as I kind of alluded to earlier do
2344480	2348120	you know a lot of these games are going this whole battle royale route because
2348120	2351800	of course that's the hot new thing right now so which two people are gonna jump
2351800	2355720	on the bandwagon first why of course it's gonna be the two big FPS
2355720	2362200	franchises Call of Duty in battlefield so Call of Duty the official announcement
2362200	2367600	hasn't come out yet they're gonna be teasing that I guess on May 17th but
2367600	2373520	from apparently people that are in the known different sources that people had
2373520	2379240	are saying that the game is not gonna have a single-player campaign like the
2379240	2382120	other games they said that there's basically gonna be focused on
2382120	2386120	multiplayer but they will have like some sort of zombies thing that's gonna
2386120	2390560	happen for the single-player portion and that kind of weird too because when you
2390560	2394920	hear that the other rumor that was out there was that modern warfare 2
2394920	2402800	remastered is not gonna have multiplayer it's like but why are you why I know why
2402800	2408160	because they're gonna sell that shit fucking separate later and that's still
2408160	2411420	you know head scratching but that's something that they're probably gonna do
2411420	2416160	I'm saying with battlefield battlefield is something that they're looking at
2416160	2424640	possibly doing like a battle royale type 4 as well so I forgot I left a game
2424640	2427160	out of my gaming week do you know what else I played this week
2427160	2431280	fortnight for night yeah I was I wasn't gonna detract from your story for no
2431280	2435400	reason the battle royale talk made me think I tried fortnight this week do you
2435400	2438340	want to hear about my experience with fortnight how's that okay so I don't
2438340	2442960	know I've watched people play fortnight I've watched people play pub G so I was
2442960	2446040	like alright well I have for tonight it's installed on my PC I think I
2446040	2449680	installed it I may have done a stream like early early early on or something I
2449680	2453040	don't remember I don't remember any of it so I was like alright I'm gonna fire
2453040	2457720	up fortnight let's do it and so I I set it up and I'm like where's the tutorial
2457720	2461280	how do I learn how to play and I'm like alright well I'm just gonna start maybe
2461280	2465320	it sets you in an intro level before you know I went right into a game that was
2465320	2470600	you know one versus 98 I'm assuming two people didn't make it so I get in there
2470600	2473800	and I'm like alright well I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing it's like
2473800	2478520	get out of the bus and I'm like how we get on man and then I'm falling slowly
2478520	2481560	and I'm like why are all these other people falling faster than me and oh oh
2481560	2485000	you have to you have to like steer it so I finally figured it out and I landed on
2485000	2488640	the ground and I was like in this open field and I'm like oh fuck this is a
2488640	2491640	terrible place to be so I'm like run to a house run to a house so I found a
2491640	2495600	house I found a barn or something I found a gun and then I was like oh oh
2495600	2498440	there's a gun up there I want I want I can't get it I'm like wait you can build
2498440	2502560	stairs right and so I built stairs to get the gun and I'm like okay I did it
2502560	2505680	I did it and then like oh shit I hear somebody okay here's the main nearby oh
2505680	2508400	they went in the house they went in the house I ran over the house I opened the
2508400	2512320	door to the house and I instantly got shotgun to death and I came in 53rd
2512320	2518240	place and I was like well that was a fortnight Bob what didn't you ever watch
2518240	2522840	battle royale of course I watched battle royale you don't run to the house you'd
2522840	2526560	let them come to you and that's exactly what this person did they knew I was
2526560	2530600	there and they waited for my stupid ass to open the door now this is fortnight
2530600	2533680	what you do is you build a giant platform in the sky and you snipe
2533680	2537400	everybody from the sky but then you're you're sitting there with your ass out
2537400	2543400	in the sky build you build like walls around it and stuff you gotcha fine
2543400	2547880	phantasm chat says newbie I didn't know what I was doing like fortnight well
2547880	2551320	technically yes that is the definition because he was a newbie to the game yes
2551320	2555720	and fortnight doesn't exactly tell you here is how you play fortnight and I was
2555720	2560760	like alright so trial by fucking fire I'm still happy I came in 53rd but that
2560760	2563920	must mean like a bunch of people probably plunged well no you know what
2563920	2568200	it was I stayed alive running around going how do I build this staircase to
2568200	2573200	this gut is it this button is this so as I'm sitting there being a dumbass other
2573200	2576120	people are getting picked off because I'm sure there's got to be areas where
2576120	2579000	like tons of people try to swarm it right that's got to be what happens in
2579000	2587160	for tonight just remember in every race someone comes in last place to register
2587160	2591160	participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at fog network calm
2591160	2598140	use the passphrase English I also watched a stream of fortnight because
2598140	2601520	one of my buddies from ingress is getting more and more into like game
2601520	2605600	streaming so he was playing fortnight from his PlayStation 4 so I watched him
2605880	2612320	and he was laughing so fucking hard because he was playing fortnight on
2612320	2615640	PlayStation 4 and he was in team mode I guess there's a team yeah you can do
2615640	2620680	teams his entire team was like 10 year old dudes and like you could hear
2620680	2628360	parents in the background all this stuff and they're and I'm like I'm like
2628360	2632240	sitting there with my mouth ajar going like where what what where is your
2632240	2636960	babysitter where and like and like did the whole time my friend Chris is just
2636960	2639720	sitting there like trying to be like super calm like you guys need to come
2639720	2641720	over to the house where are you guys right now because you're gonna get
2641720	2644560	sniped off it's like trying to be cool and calm and collected I'm like I would
2644560	2649880	not be able to handle this I would be like hilarious where it made for a
2649880	2653560	really funny stream which I think and this is why twitch is popular yeah
2653560	2658280	because it's because there is not as many screaming crazy people you know in
2658280	2664640	single-player RPGs you haven't seen me play RPGs then we need to see what
2664640	2668640	happens when you play fortnight dark saga that may not happen it doesn't
2668640	2671200	sound like something I'd enjoy it's not first-person though for what it's it's
2671200	2678160	free though it is free free if you hate it who cares you lose anything time time
2678160	2682760	is a precious commodity that no one will ever get back time is valuable god damn
2682760	2689800	it anyway uh let's see Bobby Blackwell says it's usually me who's last place in
2689800	2694320	the race see Mario Kart 8 Bobby I bet if you tried fortnight all you'd have to do
2694320	2697440	is hide like a little bitch and you'd come in like all right Bobby somewhere
2697440	2702360	someday I'll get a switch and then maybe you won't be last place or maybe it will
2702360	2705640	I don't know you know it would make me play a game like that if it was branded
2705640	2711120	hunter Hunger Games well I'm sure you had like all of the things in the
2711120	2714400	Hunger Games let's go back to Loki's story I'm sure it's coming because
2714400	2719120	everybody's battle royale-ing all the things now like I said I would represent
2719120	2722640	my district I saw this really funny meme because you know now it's the time of
2722640	2726360	year where everybody's doing e3 leaks e3 leaks so somebody put this meme online
2726360	2731080	that was like check out this awesome e3 leak it was a slide where everything had
2731080	2735320	like a battle royale mode right yeah this war like 100 yeah I was like Sims
2735320	2738400	battle royale but then the one that made me laugh really hard was that had Yoshi's
2738440	2742640	murder island in the corner and I was like I think I replied and I put if
2742640	2747100	Yoshi's murder island was a real game I would throw my Sony and Microsoft
2747100	2751360	systems in the garbage like there would be no need for them anymore I would play
2751360	2755520	nothing but Yoshi's murder island would you would you dark cycle would you play
2755520	2762640	Yoshi's murder island maybe see Nintendo 100 Yoshi's one survives I'm like Kirby
2762640	2769600	battle royale where your goal is just to eat the other curbies what were you
2769600	2774640	saying I was just gonna say you know if Nintendo was under new management you
2774640	2779760	know this one a really adult route I'd be down anything's possible but right
2779760	2783080	now it's all about labo which I know we talked a little bit about God of War at
2783080	2786520	the top of the show we didn't really address labo came out and there's
2786520	2790120	another thing that's big on twitch right now is people making their cardboard
2790120	2795800	stuff I I didn't get labo because I am still sitting here going 60 bucks for
2795800	2800640	what a cardboard piano I mean yes it looks cool but it's technically $60 it's
2800640	2806920	yeah 16 and $80 for a robot yeah like and again I'm not hating on labo like if
2806920	2812360	I had kids I would be buying this for my kids it's awesome but I don't I have mr.
2812360	2815940	smoosh and mr. smoosh would just claw at the car he would chew it yeah well
2815940	2819660	Midna choose cardboard would try to live in it Midna likes to eat boxes so
2819660	2825740	well you can make a house out of like the variety set yeah he can go squish
2825740	2828740	himself in the house yeah I think the only one of those I'd be interested in
2828740	2832420	it well the piano one is cool but I'd want to do the rock-em-sock-em robots
2832420	2836620	one because that game actually kind of looks fun yeah I mean I'm gonna wait and
2836620	2839160	see what happens with this whole labo thing I'm sure they'll be you know
2839160	2842060	especially if they start having more like third parties get in on it and it's
2842060	2844780	like oh we're making all these peripherals out of cardboard because the
2844780	2848540	little controllers are awesome and do all these things I'll be very curious
2848540	2852260	to see what happens with that in the future anyway let's talk about another
2852260	2857500	story that has to do with puzzle fighter you know there's a puzzle fighter iOS
2857500	2860260	game and I think dark soccer you've mentioned this before I know I checked
2860260	2864340	it out briefly I didn't really yeah I didn't really care for it it just again
2864340	2868940	you can't control on the phone the same way you can with a tangible controller
2868940	2872580	and that's what does it for me well apparently puzzle fighter not having a
2872580	2877220	lot of success anywhere because Capcom has announced the server will be shutting
2877220	2882860	down for the game July 31st 2018 the game will be removed from the app stores
2882860	2891340	on July 1st this game just fucking came out like not even a year ago so the
2891340	2896360	shelf life of a what do they call these games games mobile service games as a
2896360	2900840	service now is eight months long and eight eight months service and you guys
2900840	2905720	thought me Tomo was bad is me Tomo officially dead now no I'm still going
2905720	2909200	on and I think through me okay I've actually been kind of enjoying me Tomo
2909200	2915280	now that I have all this money no right yeah so but yeah puzzle fighter coming
2915280	2919000	to an end before it even really got started what made this puzzle fighter
2919000	2924180	different it had other Capcom characters in it not just Street Fighter and dark
2924180	2927980	stalkers like the original 90s puzzle fighter did which was awesome so make it
2927980	2932500	a free-to-play game put it out on a console didn't we have a story on the
2932500	2936620	show like two weeks ago that was like puzzle fighter got rated for switch and
2936620	2940580	stuff so is that just where they're gonna go with it maybe cuz it would make
2940580	2944260	a lot more sense but still if I had spent money on this game oh my god after
2944260	2947380	eight months they're gonna pull the plug when you spent money on it like I'd be
2947380	2952780	kind of pissed Oh Eames as a service no one ever said the service had to be good
2953020	2958660	and that's again when I hear stuff about like anthem and stuff I'm like well you
2958660	2961460	know now eight months is the new precedent for the minimum amount well
2961460	2966260	we look yeah look at like it was a destiny one and you know destiny to
2966260	2971340	eventually gonna go down to I mean it's only a matter of time with these online
2971340	2975100	games that don't have a single player is like what's the point they're gonna be
2975100	2980100	complete garbage it's gonna be as good as an AOL CD at some point do we need
2980180	2985420	game companies to start saying like I almost kind of want and you know Apple
2985420	2988820	could Apple could really push this if they wanted to because they did it with
2988820	2992140	a loot box thing remember they started saying if you're gonna put something
2992140	2995500	with loot boxes in our store you have to disclose that they started doing that
2995500	2999900	when the whole battlefront thing happened couldn't Apple say like you
2999900	3005000	need to start putting a guarantee through date a service is good through
3005080	3008880	XYZ date on it well this is a free-to-play game so I don't really think
3008880	3014480	that um usually though there are things about limited price limited sale on the
3014480	3018320	App Store so I think that at least anything that you'd acquire through the
3018320	3021280	App Store is gonna have some kind of disclaimer on it but aren't we at the
3021280	3024920	point where like you know game companies maybe need to start calling out oh well
3024920	3028160	if you're gonna drop real money or stuff on this we're gonna guarantee our
3028160	3032460	services are gonna be good through XYZ day I mean the only reason we all know
3032460	3036460	we keep playing Pokemon go and spending money on Pokemon go as we know that
3036460	3040420	game is done phenomenally well it continues to do well no matter what you
3040420	3043880	know you know keyboard blogger people that don't actually play the game are
3043880	3047100	telling you because this community day still do very well that game is gonna be
3047100	3051780	running for a very long time you know we know that but I'm starting to distrust
3051780	3054860	some of these other upcoming games what we have what we're gonna have a
3054860	3059180	Ghostbusters AR game coming out right I'll check it out that sounds fun though
3059180	3064220	but how long do we know it's gonna be you know like Ghostbusters if the last
3064220	3068380	Ghostbusters movie did not come out I might be all down for like anything
3068380	3072380	Ghostbusters but like it feels like Sony's just trying to milk that cow to
3072380	3077060	death and I just don't I don't want to touch anything Ghostbusters brand
3077060	3082020	anymore it's like it's ruined it for me not because of the movie the movie which
3082020	3086420	is kind of it seemed like they didn't put much effort into it's just a cop
3086420	3090860	reboot copy of the first one just gender swapping everything the cast
3090860	3094300	which I don't really care it's just no effort into it but like all the other
3094300	3098900	games associated with it have been shit that they've had a VR game that was not
3098900	3104540	good they had a non VR game that was not good so the ghost so the Ghostbusters
3104540	3108420	gaming franchise hasn't been good since the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 days
3108420	3111340	because those games were fucking fire like those games were awesome the
3111340	3115940	original Ghostbusters game they had also there's a game that was as I forget what
3115940	3119580	the title of the game was but there's a game that came out not it was a few
3119580	3124140	years ago which was basically the equivalent of a Ghostbusters 3 because
3124140	3128620	they had all the original cast so there was that I think that's the one dungeon
3128620	3132900	Buster's referring to 2009 Ghostbusters yeah so that one was good but like
3132900	3137140	everything else that's come after it is not so great I'll check it out because
3137140	3142780	it's probably gonna be free but yeah I don't know everybody wants a piece of
3142780	3148100	that Pokemon go money yeah much like Pokemon go battle royale there we go
3148100	3153300	I've struck it rich now but like an AR game battle royale real world like I
3153300	3158620	would be super into that like like I ingress is an intense game because it's
3158620	3166860	PvP but it's also like not actually like PvP like I can't fucking lay traps in
3166860	3171580	ingress or like do things to really like directly disable the other players like
3171580	3175180	it's not really like intensely PvP like that directly to say well we're talking
3175180	3178860	like a Tonya Harding situation oh no no because that would be unacceptable in
3178860	3181620	the real world but you know what I mean like what if what if there was an item
3181620	3184340	that you could like let's say a mine that you lay on the ground and if
3184340	3188940	another player walks over that mine they are they can't fire bursters for 30
3188940	3194380	minutes or something there's nothing turrets everywhere yeah so cuz you know
3194380	3200340	I'd be like oh yeah I know you know I wouldn't do it to my stuff I would put
3200340	3203860	it on their stuff like I'd be like I know you're at this portal every single
3203860	3207940	day so I'm gonna just put a bunch of crap we're aware of where your place of
3207940	3213020	employment is just feel free to like scatter that shit around all right
3213020	3216900	anyway let's move on to some more stories dark soccer you got a pretty big
3216900	3221100	deal story lots of people were talking about this week yeah given that I brought
3221100	3226060	up fire watch during my class not my classic game but the the games that I
3226060	3231540	was playing this one kind of actually hit me they basically the developer
3231540	3239380	campo Santo was acquired by valve it's 12 employees and the quote is they
3239380	3244260	agreed to join valve and maintain our jobs as video game developers and
3244260	3250540	continue product on our current project in the valley of the gods so yeah valve
3250540	3254660	acquired them so now we can't see valve isn't making games anymore because
3254660	3258020	they've just acquired people who are making games and in the valley of the
3258020	3263500	gods is going to be a first-person adventure set 1920s Egypt and they're
3263500	3268220	still supporting fire watch so it's pretty interesting it's actually made
3268220	3276260	from the company was developers from clay and telltale so I guess it's
3276260	3284020	something you know maybe we'll get a half-life 3 by them I don't know no no
3284060	3289500	probably not but still I mean it's good to know that I mean valve you know at
3289500	3293980	least sees talent in them and sees that these would be good people to add on to
3293980	3298700	their staff I mean I just hope that they'll be able to keep performing like
3298700	3303420	that be able to keep doing good games well I think the good news is that maybe
3303420	3308060	with this valve you know oversight will get a fire watch too but you will never
3308060	3312340	ever ever get a fire watch 3 so don't get your hopes up well you know if they
3312340	3315740	do it a fire watch 2 they should actually put a lot more animation into
3315740	3319500	their scenery instead of it having me so static but other than that for it being
3319500	3324380	a group of 12 people making the game it wasn't bad and did you did you play it
3324380	3331940	no I didn't I thought it was really good Rob says he loved it from the other room
3331940	3338700	but I don't know if it was an acquisition or if it was more like a
3338740	3344820	full merger it seems to me like more like it's coming off as a a adoption and
3344820	3349140	less of a full acquisition since you brought up Kirby battle royale earlier
3349140	3354620	this sounds like a curbing basically valve is inhaled them and absorb their
3354620	3358820	powers yes that is what's if they've been their rogue they've been correct
3358820	3361540	they're like they're at rogue can we can we use that for now on when a game
3361540	3365300	company gets curbied they're getting curbied okay they're sucked up and and
3365460	3371780	sometimes they could get spit out as a as you know a projectile so yeah that's
3371780	3377780	EA EA inhales them and then spits them out in a useless form well maybe but
3377780	3382140	projectiles are useful attacks in Kirby so yes if they were spit out in a
3382140	3389700	useless form it would just be like an egg like Yoshi pooping an egg no it'd
3389700	3395540	just be a shit it's just it's just a monster dump that's all anyway moving on
3395540	3399540	all right well you know this happens sometimes smaller studios get absorbed
3399540	3403100	by bigger ones it's just interesting that it's valve I think in this case you
3403100	3408060	know we just haven't heard of valve acquiring a lot of companies lately so
3408060	3416100	yay to valve making games again I guess by proxy all right moving on so since
3416100	3418980	we were talking about Minecraft a little bit earlier there is a situation where
3418980	3421980	apparently since one of the things you probably noticed Rob when you went into
3421980	3426660	the store or into Minecraft is there's a store now you can buy skins and
3426660	3430220	everything that people make and you can actually sell them and make some money
3430220	3435700	off of it as well I did notice that because I was like where is all the 4k
3435700	3440580	stuff that Microsoft was talking about at the last e3 I don't think that's ever
3440580	3443820	come out it never yeah it still is not came out they have that it's like the
3443820	3447540	super awesome super duper graphics pack or whatever is supposed to be concurrent
3447540	3452140	with the 4k and it kept getting pushed back and it I think the latest updates
3452140	3455380	was may where they were looking at so yeah all that stuff is still not out
3455380	3459820	because the 4k I think is a free update but they're anticipating a lot of people
3459820	3464220	are gonna buy this well I just want the nicer graphics just even not necessarily
3464220	3468740	4k because I don't have a 4k monitor on my laptop but I'll take the super duper
3468740	3472700	take whatever I can get yeah which is it's so funny to be sitting here going
3472700	3478180	minecraft 4k super duper but it is especially you know in the windows 10
3478180	3481340	where you have such an awesome like distance draw and everything it is it is
3481340	3485780	really impressive you know for what it is for what it is so apparently anyways
3485780	3489660	since people can't upload their own skins that they make to the store and
3489660	3493780	try to sell them some people are uploading some malicious skins to the
3493780	3499020	storefront that were basically PNG files that had malicious code inside of them
3499020	3503820	that would cause malware to appear on this on any system that they're run on
3503820	3509700	so there was three skins that they identified they were affected by it and
3509700	3515020	looks like there's like a yellow diving suit some blue hoodie thing and some
3515020	3522020	guides I don't know covered in colors for some reason anyways so they've
3522020	3528740	caught this and remove them and my ground is basically said that the
3528740	3532700	minecraft players that upload skin you know as a PNG file they can contain
3532700	3536700	malicious code this code would not be run or read by the game itself while
3536700	3540700	your antivirus software might detect this code and alert you to its presence
3540700	3544380	the code would not be able to run by itself but they're saying that the
3544380	3551260	people 50,000 users got infected by this of the apparently 74 million players and
3551300	3555180	with that you know they received messages and their minecraft accounts
3555180	3559980	saying you know your ass got glued you have maxed out your internet usage for a
3559980	3565620	lifetime and you're nailed but a new computer this is a piece of shit
3565620	3571700	Wow it seems like I told them kitty thing to do it so just be careful or
3571700	3576300	maybe just hold off on buying skins you don't really know now I'm sitting here
3576300	3579820	going why haven't we made a vog skin like try to try to make a little side
3579900	3585460	coin for vog maybe we need to get on that a little like a little pack that
3585460	3589460	has like a vog shirt and a maybe a bobby shirt I'm assuming he'd be down for this
3589460	3594260	a bobby black wolf logo shirt maybe something for olr sir ferret first mr.
3594260	3598420	smoocher I'll sell smooches likeness why not also also I will sell out mr. smoosh
3598420	3603460	to the highest bidder just there's not the cat himself I would never anyway
3603460	3609100	alright moving on let's talk about again another story about fortnight but this
3609100	3613540	one's a little bit different because it involves cliff B who is no longer with
3613540	3616620	epic games he was probably most well-known when he was at epic games
3616620	3621660	but he actually left epic in 2012 to do a new company that is called boss key
3621660	3627060	boss key made a game called law breakers that I think kind of came and went in it
3627060	3632140	yeah they've got their that's a game now radical heights is that new game their
3632140	3635940	own type of battle royale game that's very like I just looked at it and I was
3635940	3641380	like oh this is a Loki game no not really I did it doesn't look that great
3641380	3644740	I don't know really cuz it's all like neon I love that they have like a little
3644740	3648660	arcade machine in the screen yeah you like taco time you get money you pay for
3648660	3652020	stuff in like vending machines and I don't know I kind of thought it looked
3652020	3655700	cool although fantastic our chat said oh god radical heights what a joke all
3655700	3659920	right maybe I need to look into it a little more but anyway apparently cliff
3659920	3664900	went on Twitter and fired some shots at epic the company he used to work for
3664900	3668940	epic of course ended up making fortnight but cliff said in a tweet hey
3668940	3674460	at epic games could you please stop trying to hire away my team we just
3674460	3679420	launched radical heights on ue4 and are really happy with how it's going we have
3679420	3682220	plenty of ways to make it our own but they may never see the light of day if
3682220	3686520	they keep doing this apparently this move to attract boss key developers over
3686520	3691900	to fortnight is a little bit more of a recent thing hmm and also it's worth
3691900	3695500	noting both of these games are battle royale games that are that are bright
3695500	3699820	colorful they don't quite look like pub G pub G's a little more of the gritty
3699820	3705860	realistic kind of look these other games are very cartoony so apparently Bosque
3705860	3710880	has lost more than one employee to epic games recently former programmer William
3710880	3714820	McCarroll goes over to epic and replied to the tweet by saying it's presumptuous
3714820	3720100	to suggest that epic is poaching employees with all due respect assuming
3720100	3724100	that epic is the one starting contact poaching is a bit presumptuous we've all
3724100	3728940	had our own reasons for making the choice to leave BK P Bosque for epic and
3728940	3734340	to act like we are commodities being stolen is a bit hurtful we are people
3734340	3741180	first and forenote most oh shit some drama is going down in the battle royale
3741180	3747380	world but anyway just kind of interesting I mean something we kind of
3747380	3751660	forget you know again there's a lot of people hard-working people to go beyond
3751660	3755980	making behind making these games and sometimes they leave for greener grass
3755980	3760500	somewhere else in the industry that sucks but like when it's funny those not
3760500	3764020	even necessarily this situation but you know how like blue holes kind of pissed
3764020	3767940	off it you know they said Fortnite copied their formula wait till all the
3767940	3773660	other ones come out wait till how pissed they are then I hope they're working on
3773660	3778580	pub g2 or something else to really you know or some other type of like you know
3778580	3782460	to keep themselves hey hey don't forget about us don't forget about us cuz yeah
3782460	3785860	I think you're right like they're just gonna get more and more upset as this
3785860	3790780	pool gets more and more diluted which is gonna be a theme at this year's e3
3790780	3795900	absolutely I mean I know that picture that was going around on Twitter was
3795900	3801060	just a joke but there's some truth in that you can't chase you can't chase
3801060	3804900	what's popular you got to be the trendsetter I mean that's think of
3804900	3808860	something unique yeah what's a new spin you can put on by the because that's
3808860	3813340	kind of what it is like you you have the game that comes out and if it's pretty
3813340	3817820	unique and stuff granted pub G wasn't the first battle battle royale game but
3817820	3821740	you know then Fortnite comes out and kind of did it better and so now they're
3821740	3825820	the pop more popular one well some would argue if it's really better pub G still
3825820	3830540	has many many fans true I think the free-to-play aspect of it though is
3830540	3834260	better because at least you know there's not much to invest there that's
3834260	3839420	true but I think that everybody's gonna try to get a piece of that pie now and
3839420	3842420	it's just are they gonna be really innovating on this or is it just gonna
3842420	3849580	be kind of like me too me too yeah yeah yeah maybe what the pub G folks was
3849580	3853720	her name blue blue hole what they need to do is team up with Nintendo and make
3853720	3857580	a game called Yoshi's murder island and then blue hole will be at the top of
3857580	3861700	their game so I think that's what needs to happen in that meanwhile dark soccer
3861700	3866260	would be up for us in the news well I'm excited and waiting for Deadpool 2 and
3866260	3872100	I'm going to be super happy to watch it but the director is adapting a video
3872100	3878140	game and I don't know the last dead both I guess the Deadpool game that came out
3878140	3884100	was hilarious but not great it controlled really crap I don't know I
3884100	3886940	watched the cutscenes on that game I didn't actually play the game and I was
3886940	3890860	fucking laughing my ass off I was on the first mission and it was just impossibly
3890860	3896060	hard to control although I loved going around this house that was funny I just
3896060	3899780	remembered there was a scene though where he had a sentinels foot it was a
3899780	3904420	foot or a hand and he was flying around in it with a dog and he ended up killing
3904420	3908900	one of the bad guys that's how he just like the big bad guys all zoom just
3908900	3915420	slammed it down on him and it was hilarious but at any rate the director
3915420	3925020	David leech is going to be directing the video game adoption so he also is
3925020	3932740	directing the division that's based off of one of the Tom Clancy games so who
3932740	3937860	knows what'll happen but I hope that it controls better than the Deadpool game
3937860	3944540	did but has all the same hilariousness in it so apparently he's also doing
3944540	3953420	another fast and furious spin-off with the rock okay he's a busy busy guy well
3953420	3958100	when you make a movie like Deadpool you're probably pretty in demand I would
3958100	3962340	reckon so all right just a few more stories for you guys in the classic game
3962340	3967620	of the week so SNK is celebrating their 40th anniversary and so when a game
3967620	3970980	company celebrates its 40th anniversary what's that mean it's got to put out
3970980	3974700	another mini console obviously because that's the new thing that's the new
3974700	3980260	hotness so um it wasn't that long ago actually SNK kind of re-released the
3980260	3984580	Neo Geo they did like the little mini system with some games in there as well
3984580	3989940	but now they're planning on doing it kind of teasing it right now a new
3989940	3996740	compilation system perhaps basically says a new game machine and they have a
3996780	4002540	picture of something underneath like a looks like a cloak or something that
4002540	4006740	says Neo Geo so could we see like a Neo Geo mini with a bunch of Neo Geo games
4006740	4012420	in it I hope so and I hope it doesn't cost a Neo Geo price that's right that's
4012420	4016100	about it yeah I would so get a Neo Geo mini are you kidding that would be
4016100	4020620	awesome be careful the other ones had really shitty emulation in them okay
4020620	4024380	assuming it is a quality product especially if they come with like
4024420	4028020	actual like fighter stick type controllers or you can use like if you
4028020	4032020	had the real thing if you could use them on it yes that would be rad so yeah I
4032020	4036420	would so be down like and I would even pay like you know a slightly increased
4036420	4040260	price if those controllers are fucking bomb the controls are good and the
4040260	4044340	emulation is good then yeah for sure oh my god just as long as fatal fury
4044340	4049300	special isn't it I'm good and not real about a half fatal fury special not real
4049340	4053780	about real that wasn't bad I didn't like real about but fatal very special I
4053780	4057780	think I have fatal either a fatal fury to or fatal fury special on Neo Geo well
4057780	4062220	I mean they're not that different very specials just all the one characters and
4062220	4067940	fatal very to basically yeah as my favorite he has my old Neo Geo system oh
4067940	4074340	really well cuz I had a MVS that was in my arcade cabin I bought that with a
4074380	4080380	totally legit 68 and one cart that has all these different games in it and I
4080380	4085300	think I sent it to him with what they call that oh is that when all the
4085300	4089180	systems fried in the storm well no it was it was with a because I have a bunch
4089180	4095900	of these very column basically a way to hook up arcade hardware to TVs he says
4095900	4099720	a super gun super gun thank you I couldn't remember the name so I sent it
4099720	4106840	to him with a super gun to nice run all right cool cool all right well I would
4106840	4110640	so be down for like an SNK mini as long as you know again the quality is good
4110640	4113920	because you know they put out a ton of those games on PlayStation 4 and switch
4113920	4117440	and stuff those arcade archives but like the pools getting a little diluted it
4117440	4119920	would just be nice to have like one collection with everything in one place
4119920	4124240	but again the price has got to be right you know I don't want to pay like $500
4124240	4128440	unless I mean if it's a nice fucking cabinet would like like if it looks
4128440	4132040	like your little VPD cabinet but it's like a neo geo official thing like then
4132040	4135040	maybe I'd pay several hundred dollars for it but I'm assuming they're gonna
4135040	4137620	try to make something that maybe just plugs into an existing you know that has
4137620	4141760	neo geo games on it that's true that is true I have to have you figure out what
4141760	4148640	I am plugged on that okay that hasn't been on in a long time so anyway anyway
4148640	4152280	moving on we got one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game
4152280	4156280	of the week and this one has to do with Sonic Mania Sonic Mania apparently got a
4156320	4163600	patch recently that is adding some new things they have done some animations to
4163600	4167280	transition stages because that was the feature in the old Sonic games was kind
4167280	4171000	of missing in Sonic Mania so now they have some new transitions that help out
4171000	4175040	the story this patch by the way it showed up on PlayStation 4 and I think
4175040	4178640	it was put out a little early but I'm assuming it'll be coming out for the
4178640	4183040	other systems very soon there's some other small features as well cutscenes
4183040	4187280	can be skipped menus have been changed additional moves from past games like
4187280	4193440	the insta shield the super peel out from Sonic CD and knuckles mode can be used
4193440	4198500	in save files and not just non save play you can also disable the time limit
4198500	4202200	which is pretty neat and you can do multiplayer without the stretch to
4202200	4206040	visuals so they've done a lot of little changes there to Sonic Mania to keep
4206040	4210920	that game exciting I thought Sonic Mania was a great little follow-up in the
4210920	4214440	Sonic franchise I'm excited to see it still getting some love all right
4214440	4220360	speaking of old games getting love every week here at Orange Laundry do we like
4220360	4223760	to jump into the gaming vault and dark soccer will find a game that she thinks
4223760	4229320	hey you should be checking this game out this is kind of a yeah I was gonna say
4229320	4235480	this is a very obscure game in a very obscure but in a popular series it's not
4235480	4240680	even that obscure it had a US release not on the system but it had it on
4240680	4245320	Gameboy on the Gameboy all right well let's get to it what is the classic
4245320	4252480	game of the week Rockman and Forte Mirei Mirei Kara no Chosha Chosensha and which
4252480	4259160	is Rockman and Forte challenger from the future it is developed by Capcom and
4259160	4264880	published by Bandai for the WonderSwan this particular one was only released
4264880	4269920	in Japan on the WonderSwan not even the WonderSwan color this is old school
4269920	4276200	and in this game of course it takes place in the year 20XX a group of robots
4276200	4284920	from the future called the dimensions attack Symphony City and there is one
4284920	4290440	robot Rockman who is trying to take care of everything called Rockman shadow and
4290440	4295520	he seems obsessed with destruction but the real Rockman is like this is fucked
4295520	4304120	up and tries to do something so anyway Wily sends Forte who we call base
4304120	4310760	over here to investigate as well so you can play as one or the other so in this
4310760	4315280	game there is some different control and actually my apologies it was the
4315280	4319280	original Rockman and Forte that came out on the Gameboy Advance as Mega Man and
4319280	4326240	base this one come out not this one yeah but basically Rockman plays you
4326240	4333560	know or Mega Man plays like he normally does but Forte has a rapid-fire standard
4333560	4340240	gun but it can't be fired while moving and he has a dash and a double jump
4340240	4348480	there's also another gameplay change from the earlier games the the robot
4348520	4352480	masters don't have a period of invincibility after being damaged you
4352480	4356400	can just keep pounding and pounding pounding and since the WonderSwan has a
4356400	4361120	third set of controls that are located above the traditional directional
4361120	4367720	controls you can play vertically so for example if you are playing on air con
4367720	4371240	man you are required to change how you hold it so that you can play the level
4371240	4376280	vertically a lot of that was in some of their puzzle games as well as the
4376280	4382120	Klonoa game so you also have the bolt systems you can collect these bolts so
4382120	4387280	that you can buy different items and they are universal you know like extra
4387280	4392520	lives or exclusive items like Rockman being able to get Rush, Eddie, Tango and
4392520	4398960	Beat and Forte can get gospel who is known as trouble over here and reggae
4398960	4404320	that's a bird robot that was the last time it was seen was in a 1983 Famicom
4404320	4408240	game called wily and right no rock board that's paradise and maybe I'll
4408240	4413440	cover that at some point some people don't really like it some people super
4413440	4419560	like it I thought it was a pretty fun little game so that's it it is again
4419560	4425240	called Rockman and Forte Mirai Kata no Chosensha thank you for pronouncing it
4425240	4428840	one more time so I don't have to I will say I'm not familiar with this game I
4428840	4433640	mean I remember the Gameboy Advance you know I played your old roommate's copy
4433640	4440200	of this Oh drama central room I'm a central roommate his class I blast from
4440200	4444400	the past that is how I played this game oh boy all right yeah I was gonna say
4444400	4449200	like I have a WonderSwan but just not this game but I gotta say I mean I
4449200	4453120	realized we don't always highlight the best games in classic games the week
4453120	4455520	just games you should be paying attention to and I think most people
4455520	4457960	probably don't even know this one exists unless you really pay a close attention
4457960	4462640	to Japanese gaming it's probably not the best looking Mega Man game it wasn't
4462640	4466240	really ranked as one of the best playing games either but but it's better
4466240	4472160	than that Mega Man PC game and it's really not a bad game I enjoyed it I
4472160	4478200	thought it was a fun game yeah but um it but mostly I when I played the game so I
4478200	4484000	could play through his forte so yeah not a bad game all right there it is your
4484000	4489660	classic a game of the week one more time Darzaga I just closed it Mirai Kata no
4489660	4495540	Chosensha yes that make a man on the WonderSwan yeah all right all right
4495540	4498900	we're gonna take warriors from the future we're gonna take a quick break
4498900	4502020	but we're gonna come back with plenty more orange lounge radio including
4502020	4505820	rapid-fire news some of your emails at participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
4505820	4510020	and of course your calls at orange lounge radio all one word on Skype when
4510020	4516900	we come back with more of orange lounge radio right after this
4519660	4526900	welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight with episode number
4526900	4533060	727 of our show it is April the 22nd of 2018 and our show is already in progress
4533060	4537900	we've got to get to some rapid-fire news here so let's do it
4537900	4542360	Loki why don't you start us off some rapid-fire news yes so apparently the
4542360	4547200	lineup for next month's free games with gold has kind of leaked out there was an
4547400	4553040	unlisted video on the Xbox YouTube channel that showed basically what the
4553040	4560160	lineup was so what we've got coming for May for me for the Xbox one May 1st to
4560160	4566520	the 31st we've got super mega baseball 2 and from May 16th to June 15th
4566520	4572880	Metal Gear Solid 5 the phantom pain that's a pretty awesome free game the
4572880	4577400	Xbox 360 games that are compatible with Xbox one we have streets of rage from
4577400	4584960	May 1st to the 15th and vanquish from the 16th of the 31st so not bad at all
4584960	4590040	yeah those are some really good picks yeah Mel yourself five she's yeah
4590040	4592920	pretty awesome wish I know a lot of people are really into as well so this
4592920	4598800	is uh it was a good day yeah speaking of Konami Konami is making a new
4598800	4603320	Castlevania game for iOS so they have a game called Castlevania grimoire of
4603320	4610320	souls that's in closed beta right now in Japan and apparently the game is set you
4610320	4615400	know like most other castle games in a world which Dracula has been completely
4615400	4621800	erased but someone decides to resurrect him as always as always what's gonna be
4621800	4628400	kind of unique though so this is a to 2d game but it also supports co-op play for
4628400	4633120	up to four players so that's kind of cool yeah but it's on the phone how am I
4633120	4637400	gonna control it appropriately right yeah I get your point there really I
4637400	4641560	don't know I just like I get excited when I hear new Castlevania and then
4641560	4646160	it's oh but it's that I mean the game sounds good in theory but again how am I
4646160	4649600	supposed to control it on the phone well like a lot of companies they're very
4649600	4653120	lazy importing their stuff over I guess we'll see this come to the switch and
4653120	4658000	other platforms just the port of the iOS games well I mean if it's good then
4658080	4662400	fine that would be great yeah all right well speaking of the switch and games
4662400	4666040	that will be coming out on the switch the official Nintendo magazine actually
4666040	4668840	there's oh no there is an official Nintendo magazine I was like wait what I
4668840	4672440	thought they got rid of that no I think there is a in another in another country
4672440	4676080	there's another Nintendo magazine but anyways the Spanish edition of the
4676080	4679880	Nintendo magazine and there is a section on Pokemon for the switch it does
4679880	4685000	confirm that the eighth generation of Pokemon will be in this new switch game
4685000	4689320	so it is not like a reboot of gen 1 as some people have been speculating or
4689320	4693960	anything like that the article also mentions the game will be in 2018 or
4693960	4699040	later so it's not guaranteeing that it's gonna make this year but we'll see we'll
4699040	4703040	see you know they got to get it right also they are rethinking that there will
4703040	4709120	be new mechanics in this game so don't expect necessarily the same formula that
4709120	4714520	we saw before so anyway also one other thing that maybe goes with this a little
4714560	4718720	bit is that the company game freak has actually trademarked the term in Japan
4718720	4726320	anyway ultra shiny great as if the shiny addiction wasn't bad enough now we may
4726320	4729800	have ultra shinies we don't know what that means or anything like that but
4729800	4733360	maybe that's gonna be one of these new game mechanics and yes I'll be sure to
4733360	4737020	ask Shane all about it next time I see him although we just really don't know a
4737020	4740400	lot right now outside of this term do you guys like hunting shinies and
4740400	4745640	Pokemon go no I never get them I never get me the order the hair days only
4745640	4749200	during the community and even during the community days like last time I got what
4749200	4755080	to I got one shiny all together oh and the egg event a lot of people actually
4755080	4758980	are really upset at me because I've actually hatched two shiny toga peas
4758980	4762960	both during that event so I have a shiny toga pea and a shiny toy get tick or
4762960	4766760	whatever it's called evolution which a lot of the local players are like you're
4766760	4772600	fucking lucky I've never seen a shiny Toby so I have one Toby I'll take it
4772600	4778000	and a pillow I'll take it JD and chat says I got a shiny mile today as part of
4778000	4785560	a raid lucky we show anyone hmm all right anyway also moving on some
4785560	4788680	information that you heard about in the intro to tonight's show it has to do
4788680	4794640	with a leaked video oh boy another leak from Microsoft and this shows what the
4794640	4799720	new Xbox Live avatars are gonna look like Microsoft needs depends they're
4799720	4804800	quite leaky anyway these characters we know they've been under redesigned for a
4804800	4808760	while we've seen some glimpses of what's gonna be but apparently now thanks to
4808760	4812320	this video we know there's gonna be dozens of eye shapes hairstyles costumes
4812320	4817000	moods meaning animations for your characters that's gonna be a new thing
4817000	4821840	this ties into some earlier rumors that there was gonna be like a career system
4821840	4825800	not achievements but like a career system that kind of runs side-by-side
4825800	4831760	with that for your profile and that this career system may actually unlock
4831760	4839280	customization items through loot boxes everybody's favorite but whatever they're
4839280	4843200	just avatars I mean who sounds like it's just loot boxes for gay achievements
4843200	4848120	which I'm fine I mean I have an Xbox Live avatar but my little picture is
4848120	4853960	still the olr logo that was for a short time on the 360 as part of like one of
4853960	4857480	those like gamerscore blog packs we were very lucky enough during our time with
4857480	4859960	all games we're actually in one of those pack you can't get it anymore though
4859960	4864040	sadly they delisted it from the store several years ago probably whatever we
4864040	4869340	sign was only gonna be valid for a few years so yeah if you don't have the olr
4869340	4873320	icon sadly you'll never get it unless I don't know you take a picture or
4873320	4880040	something but I see a few I still have the PNG file for it yeah I put malicious
4880040	4883280	code in there so that you know when you run it in your system it puts all the
4883280	4886480	malware Bobby Blackwell says you can still get it I thought they delisted
4886480	4891840	them oh you just need to know someone with the pack on a USB stick okay so you
4891840	4896560	have to kind of do it that way you have to basically log in as somebody else and
4896560	4899640	download it or some of that or Bobby says you have it on a new I have it on a
4899640	4903640	USB stick so you can move it to a new 360 well that's good to know maybe
4903640	4909480	that's something we need to give away to listeners a USB stick with all the old
4909480	4917480	icons anyway how many of the shows in that pack are still on the air some of
4917480	4920680	the all games should did dead pixel life have a picture in that because I know
4920680	4924680	they're still around but I don't know how many in that pack are still actually
4924680	4929600	on the air probably not a lot Oh video game outsiders was probably in that pack
4929600	4931920	too because they were with all games for a while so they were probably in it
4931920	4937480	too and I know they're still going so hmm interesting anyway um what else I
4937480	4941000	want to say about this oh no word on when the new avatars will launch but
4941000	4945800	everybody's probably guessing e3 would be a really good bet for that I'll be a
4945800	4949760	really really good bet as something they could say is going live right now is all
4949760	4954080	this avatar stuff at e3 dark saga we have for us before we get to releases
4954080	4962040	has some stuff well it looks like night trap is going to be coming on to the
4962040	4970220	switch thanks to limited run games so yay night trap isn't that good I know
4970220	4974760	it's like it was funny like the first 5,000 times we've heard that night
4974760	4981080	Travis really joke now it's like okay it wasn't that good we're over it I heard
4981120	4987000	the funny part is though I heard it's rated T for teen I have no idea how they
4987000	4991320	pull that off with all the outrage that fucking game got back in the day it's T
4991320	4996440	for teen like how how about s for stupid
4996440	5002080	well anyway other news Kingdom hearts 3 is gonna have some minigames in it that
5002080	5007240	look like little Game & Watch games although when I was looking at it the
5007280	5012640	style of Mickey and Sora and many and all that look like the 30s era Mickey
5012640	5016120	but you've got like a little Game & Watch child screen that you're playing
5016120	5021560	them on so that's pretty funny but the little minigames are there's the barnyard
5021560	5026680	battle the carnival kid giant land and musical farmer I wish this article used
5026680	5031520	an Oxford comma so that I would know that giant land and musical farmer were
5031520	5037320	two different games but it looks kind of neat I mean I think it'll be fun it
5037320	5040960	doesn't say anything about how it's accessed it's just in the trailer but it
5040960	5044920	looks cute I mean it'd be kind of neat if they did like some of these is like a
5044920	5048840	little Oh see it looks like he's actually playing a handheld system in
5048840	5053320	the game so maybe it's how you build up like more points or something you know
5053320	5057520	what else would be neat a release date well there's that although they did
5057520	5062720	confirm 2018 right so we know this is squares eventually where Enix is a big
5062720	5066280	release for this year yeah so don't expect that thought fancy seven thing
5066280	5070600	till next year it is what it is yeah I thought they did didn't what didn't like
5070600	5075160	Japan have a d23 type of thing and they confirmed it's this year yeah it was a
5075160	5081600	recent thing yes so I guess I guess we'll see with the next release anyway
5081600	5086080	um or with e3 I'm sure they'll talk about when that will be out anyway
5086080	5088640	because they announce the date does it mean they have to stick to that day
5088640	5093160	that's very true hey it's gotta be right that's all it is gotta be right let's
5093160	5096000	move on to some release dates travel around the world and check out some
5096000	5099680	releases starting with Loki what's coming out all right so we actually
5099680	5103520	have some decent stuff this week so certain things off we've got Adventure
5103520	5109920	Time Pirates of interior done I I don't know I don't watch the ventures I can't
5109920	5112560	pronounce that name it's it's an adventure it's an adventure time game
5112720	5118560	PC switch PlayStation 4 and Xbox one this one I could pronounce coming out on

5151560	5154640	butthole is coming through the switch as well that is actually worth picking up

5378640	5385640	as participate at orange lounge radio.com there's my music I lost my mail
5385640	5390160	bag music all right participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to
5390160	5393960	send your email stark Sakura what you got this first one was titled pinball so
5393960	5399120	I instantly wanted to read it once farsight studios irons out the licensing
5399120	5403720	for the pinball arcade for the switch I assume we won't be seeing an exclusive
5403720	5408480	translation of the got live Super Mario Brothers table that comes from Robert M
5408480	5413000	I'd love to see it yeah but it was terrible it wasn't wasn't there am I
5413000	5417400	wrong wasn't there two tables wasn't there a smaller kids table and then
5417400	5420800	there was like a big full-size I think that it was the same one but the kids
5420800	5425600	yeah huh I think it just really had to do with it just it was a short body
5425600	5433420	table anyway oh yeah not I think as far as as I know the only one was the you
5433420	5438360	know the the short kid table was the pipe came out and shot the ball out yeah
5438360	5443640	yeah tables just weren't very good do any of these collections have the
5443640	5449160	return from Mars in there actually yes I know I've played that table in one of
5449160	5454040	these collections shit I don't remember which one it was it was revenge from
5454040	5456960	ours or whatever I don't remember because it was attacked from ours and
5456960	5460460	then the pinball 2000 was revenge from ours yes revenge from I thought the
5460460	5463900	pinball 2000 version was in one of those packs but maybe I am confusing it with
5463900	5468100	the old one yeah there weren't really too many of those pinball 2000 tables
5468140	5471620	anyway maybe in our chat somebody knows over at live.vognetwork.com wasn't there
5471620	5477940	only one other game they did the there was one other episode one oh that's
5477940	5480980	right there was there's a Phantom Menace table in that same yeah I was
5480980	5484420	that's right I mean it was a fun table if that movie hadn't been annoying as
5484420	5490200	shit and you got to thwack Jar Jar Binks to the ball so that's always fun yes but
5490200	5498960	the next email here hey OLR crew AZHP here I've been behind on or is it as HP
5498960	5506200	I should ask I've just never bothered we always said AZHP okay or is it as it's
5506200	5509760	like that the cupid sound really I've been behind on the podcast for a few
5509760	5513520	months and as such haven't written in a while since my responses wouldn't be
5513520	5517280	very timely however one thing has cropped up fairly frequently in the past
5517280	5521680	few months on your show that I had to address every time the subject of pub G
5521680	5524840	versus fortnight comes up many of the hosts are quick to say something to the
5524840	5528560	effect of pub G tried to pursue legal action against fortnight because
5528560	5532760	fortnight is doing better than pub G the reason pub G pursued legal action
5532760	5536640	against epic regarding fortnight is a little more nuanced than this
5536640	5539840	fortnight's marketing reference pub G directly when they announced their
5539840	5546440	battle royale mode this coupled with the fact that epic the makers of the unreal
5546440	5550760	engine which pub G runs on was releasing a free mode in their floundering game
5550760	5555840	and what was clearly a reactionary move to pub G success could be construed as a
5555840	5559560	conflict of interest as they could theoretically hold back engine
5559560	5563320	improvements to pub G in order to give their own game a competitive advantage
5563320	5567520	in the marketplace that being said if what you reported two weeks ago is true
5567520	5571040	in pub G is now pursuing legal action against other games for copying aspects
5571040	5574520	of their game that's a lot less defensible as Robin look you rightly
5574520	5579160	pointed out look and feel of the video game cannot be trademarked as proven in
5579160	5583000	the street fighter versus fighters history legal battle of the 1990s now
5583000	5586720	I'm not asking you guys to stop bagging on pub G if that's what you feel like
5586720	5590920	doing but I thought that I should chime in with extra information that you may
5590920	5593920	not have known about so you can all have the facts before choosing to criticize
5593920	5599240	them yours truly is HP for the record I haven't said shit about it well and to
5599240	5603960	be fair I'm not bagging on pub G I'm bagging on the executives and the things
5603960	5608320	that they do and say and yes kind of goes in line with that I know pub G has
5608320	5613200	his fans I'm not gonna disrespect that you know just like we hardly ever talk
5613200	5616280	about sports games on the show but I recognize those games have their fans
5616280	5619400	and like you know they're super into it and that's cool but here's the other
5619400	5624520	thing like I understand the nuance with the engine specifically is I think the
5624520	5629840	thing that kind of differentiates this however to use other games in your games
5629840	5633200	marketing I don't think that is particularly anything new because I kind
5633240	5637320	of there was a legal case about that in the past well and I go I go back my head
5637320	5640280	just goes back to you know again I'm dating myself here gonna I go back to
5640280	5644160	the old magazines with the Genesis does wouldn't intend don't you know that
5644160	5649440	whole thing right and then you know like I know those neo geo ads used to call
5649440	5652800	the shit out of the other game makers because their thing was so beefy
5652800	5657240	powerful and $1,000 but that's you know that was one thing these do so there'd
5657240	5662040	been a legal case on it in the past to where it was said that you can use
5662040	5667560	another game from another system as a point of comparison to advertise your
5667560	5672400	product right right but I I do realize where things get a little dicey now when
5672400	5676240	it comes to the engine and just kind of like you know where and I hell yeah
5676240	5680040	fortnight this battle royale thing they added was like a last-ditch thing to
5680040	5685360	save their game it worked though mm-hmm like I mean we kind of have to be mad
5685360	5690320	because you didn't think about it well but the problem is they did think about
5690400	5698040	it but they didn't think about doing it for free okay so for tonight found a way
5698040	5702520	to make it free and probably for that reason is why it's doing so more six
5702520	5706920	like I only checked it out cuz it was free if PUBG was free I probably would
5706920	5713080	have checked that out so not not to mention that there's been complaints
5713080	5719720	about you know there still being some kinks in the game in PUBG so dark to see
5719720	5723920	and Chad says didn't they do things like brand X in the 50s for that so they
5723920	5728400	still do that or like competitor brand or yeah because sometimes they just
5728400	5732200	simply don't want to name the other brand you know love competitor brand
5732200	5735760	competitors but then you also though now have like for example your cell phone
5735760	5740840	companies compared to X Network you know and they'll name them by name sure and
5740840	5744600	like Coke and Pepsi always call each other out don't they mm-hmm yeah but
5744600	5746760	you're right I know what you're talking about with the brand X thing cuz
5746760	5750040	sometimes when it comes to like this makes me think of Batman I remember like
5750040	5754120	a catch-up thing where it's like this ketchup is better than nine out of ten
5754120	5758280	people prefer this ketchup to brand X oh it just makes me think of the the the
5758280	5763240	scene in the 90s Batman with Jack Nicholson he's like they're using brand
5763240	5769560	X fantastic with a very fair counterpoint in our chat PUBG mobile is
5769560	5774120	free that's right it is free it's but it's mobile and you all know how I feel
5774120	5778440	about controlling something mobile but if it's free I should I did download it
5778440	5782240	and I launched it and that's as far as I got because I was like I wasn't on Wi-Fi
5782240	5785760	that's what it was I wasn't on Wi-Fi when I launched it I was like wait a
5785760	5791200	minute this is not a game you want to play on on mobile data so I'll check
5791200	5796200	that out later though so last email that came in actually quite literally before
5796200	5801560	I loaded from when it opened the first mail to open the second so like in
5801560	5808200	before the buzzer right okay this comes from smash og through the website so
5808200	5812000	people are still using that sup olr this is the first time I've been able to
5812000	5816320	listen live due to my work hours so that's pretty cool well thank you for
5816320	5820280	listening like yeah thanks for being here anyway I think you have been over
5820280	5824480	this topic before but refresh my memory what game releases this year are you
5824480	5828800	almost excited about for me it's Red Dead Redemption 2 for sure the first Red
5828800	5832640	Dead was one of the few games that I could actually play all the way through
5832640	5838720	was like binge watching a good TV series anyway how about you good question I'm
5838720	5844240	even if we and look let's be real in 727 episodes of olr we repeat stuff
5844240	5847760	sometimes it happens like fuck there's things where it's like did we just talk
5847760	5851000	about this four weeks ago but you know I don't know I don't remember last week
5851000	5854960	sometimes when you get together with the same group of people every time
5854960	5860960	sometimes the same topics come up it just happens so what games are you
5860960	5864320	looking forward to well Red Dead Redemption 2 has got to be on your list
5864320	5872280	as well yeah yeah of course anything else besides that one I was I was
5872280	5878040	looking forward to black ops 4 yeah that was until all the rumored news right now
5878040	5884400	so I'm not looking forward to it now and I don't even know if I'd buy it even if
5884520	5889600	it was okay coming out cuz like I thought about I got like what was the
5889600	5893880	last game I think it advanced warfare and I was like oh yeah I'm gonna buy the
5893880	5898560	season pass and play online with all my friends and that was just all money
5898560	5902040	thrown away cuz I didn't end up playing it very much I played through the
5902040	5906960	campaign campaign was fun but that's kind of all I play through those
5906960	5912880	nowadays is the campaign I mean I'll wait until e3 to hear what else is
5912880	5916080	coming out because I think a lot of that stuff I don't know what's in the
5916080	5919960	pipeline yeah that's the thing I kind of feel like you should ask this question
5919960	5924680	again in June because we there's a lot of things that are probably coming out
5924680	5929640	this year that we don't know about yet so that'd be that for me though okay I
5929640	5932800	got I got one more okay so crackdown three would be the other one okay
5932800	5938600	assuming it comes out ever I'm sure it will it's gotta be it's gotta be 2017 or
5938600	5947200	18 or 19 or 20 for me Kingdom Hearts 3 absolutely assuming they mean that 2018
5947200	5951760	date I would say Metroid Prime 4 if that was the thing that Nintendo was teasing
5951760	5955000	for this year that's kind of where we need e3 because I would also kind of put
5955000	5958040	Pokemon Gen 8 on that list for the switch I really want to see how Pokemon
5958040	5961880	goes to the switch so that would be on my list as well I'm gonna go to the
5961880	5966200	mobile phone round two I am super curious about Harry Potter wizards unite
5966200	5971480	yes because that is of course you know it's Niantic isn't making the game I
5971480	5975440	think it's port key games who's doing the other Harry Potter mobile game is
5975440	5980400	working with Niantic probably borrowing Niantic's portal network basically to
5980400	5984800	make the Harry Potter wizards unite game so I'm super curious about that and I
5984800	5989560	imagine that's gonna be a 2018 game I'm curious about the Mario Kart mobile game
5989560	5994920	oh I forgot it was a thing Jamie shit we probably Animal Crossing oh you you're
5994960	5997960	still holding out hope for a new Animal Crossing yeah with the leaks a couple
5997960	6002760	weeks ago at the website or whatever this is me okay um I guess kind of
6002760	6006960	Kingdom Hearts 3 although I didn't finish Kingdom Hearts 2 mm-hmm um I
6006960	6013360	don't know mace basically Animal Crossing cuz that's kind of been my my

6145920	6152240	get to the skype line Loki alright so there's a game called halo online that
6152240	6160680	was announced back in I think 2015 so the farthest it went was actually it did
6160680	6167080	a beta test in Russia in 2015 but it didn't really get much further than that
6167200	6173320	but apparently there's been a mod project going on called El Dorado and
6173320	6178280	they've been working on basic El Dorado like those cities of gold and all that
6178280	6183440	somebody say Doritos it was it's L do Rito so it's weird
6183440	6190600	el de wr ito it is it's do Mountain Dew and Doritos get it that's what they're
6190600	6195320	doing I got it you made a joke I got it all right you got that
6195320	6201640	reference so basically this has been worked on since 2016 and two they're
6201640	6205840	trying to take this game that was kind of partially made and bring it up to
6205840	6210760	like a full game and so now they have the 0.6 update which brings the game
6210760	6216200	even closer to halo 3 they've developed its upgraded graphics new maps they have
6216200	6222200	their own Forge map editor it looks pretty awesome so they have actually
6222400	6228680	like a trailer you can check out and everything but yeah I mean it's pretty
6228680	6235880	awesome looking size you doing chat says isn't a halo already online what dumb
6235880	6239840	asses well I think this is supposed to be like a free-to-play game type of
6239840	6244080	thing I think was it supposed to be more like MMO II to I don't say well it's MMO
6244080	6247920	it was a battle royale yeah I think it was more along the lines of like they
6247920	6251680	have like a Call of Duty online that was like in China it's basically a free to
6251680	6255520	play game and they have like maps that appeared in the console versions of the
6255520	6258720	game but you know there's all the free-to-play mechanics in there as well
6258720	6264000	like you know I guess loop well I say free-to-play mechanics nowadays but now
6264000	6269680	that I think of it it's actually more of just mechanics now that are in games you
6269680	6274520	know where you can purchase skins and stuff like that so far they have not
6274520	6278720	received the cease-or-desist or any further takedown actions yet they said
6278720	6282120	they're taking careful steps and distribution of 0.6 to make sure that
6282120	6289880	doesn't happen yeah so interesting though that this is a thing that's been
6289880	6294560	worked on but yeah it looks really polished is so far even yeah interesting
6294560	6299000	how a modders are gonna finish that up when Microsoft wouldn't or bungee or
6299000	6302080	whoever was doing it at that time it was three four three games yeah oh yeah
6302080	6305000	because this would have been after the transition right yeah okay it was
6305000	6312000	apparently this was announced I guess right around the time of halo 5 so kai's
6312000	6317960	judo and chat says they need to do a halo battle royale game be careful what
6317960	6323640	you wish for because I you know Microsoft Microsoft wants people to buy
6323640	6327400	Xbox ones and wants people to be jazzed about their exclusives everybody's
6327400	6331280	talking about God of War this week but Microsoft's like hey sea of thieves
6331480	6336400	hello they want people to remember they got exclusives too so I think a halo
6336400	6340120	battle royale that's it's gonna happen battle royale like you know what like
6340120	6343480	even they go back to Minecraft I remember one of the like more popular
6343480	6347640	mods that was that round was the hunger game mods yeah so they were basically
6347640	6351360	just cribbing that but like it would be nice to have like an official game oh
6351360	6354400	that was like no maybe not call it hunger games you can call battle royale
6354400	6357960	or something like that where is played very similarly where you you don't have
6357960	6360640	to have like a mod or something to set it up you know that would be compatible
6360880	6368200	with the console versions would be nice all right let's talk about twitch
6368200	6373120	because twitch got banned in an entire country this week that's not pleasant
6373120	6377480	news twitch got banned in Russia what okay well here's the thing it didn't
6377480	6381880	actually get banned they got blocked and it was inadvertent and it's because
6381880	6386800	Russia is kind of putting some smackdown on some IPs owned by Amazon and Google
6386840	6391840	the reason why this all goes back to the messaging app telegram you guys ever use
6391840	6395800	telegram no I've used it for ingress related things it's basically just a
6395800	6399200	chat app okay it's a chat app but the thing about it is you can actually
6399200	6403520	encrypt your messages in telegram so you can send messages that are encrypted so
6403520	6408800	that way the government can't watch you okay and Russia and the security people
6408800	6414000	there don't like that because they want to be able to access data messages so
6414080	6419040	Russia is trying to ban telegram telegram relies on Amazon and Google's
6419040	6424720	cloud services so the communications regulator in Russia has bulk banned a
6424720	6428760	significant number of IP addresses and IP gates that are owned by the companies
6428760	6434240	so Amazon being that they own twitch basically twitch is getting caught in
6434240	6438280	the crossfire of all this so it has nothing to do a twitch it's telegram a
6438280	6444760	messaging app how about that so there you go so so far anyway it doesn't seem
6444760	6447720	like twitch can still be accessed in Russia and of course that has some
6447720	6455600	people kind of irritated about it so anyway some folks are using VPN and tor
6455600	6459440	to get around it and actually write messages on the actual twitch website
6459440	6463800	and that was according to one I think broadcaster over on reddit that was
6463800	6470640	talking about how to get around that ban so there you go going to our chat
6470640	6475880	over at live dot vog network comm some comments on telegram JD says furries use
6475880	6480960	telegram heavily I did not know that Sia Tabiri says telegram has some great
6480960	6486400	emoji though that is true there is a very large sticker database of emoji
6486400	6492400	available in telegram so that's kind of neat let's see also over at chat live
6492400	6496320	dot vog network comm s 200 Matt says everyone is getting VPNs over there then
6496320	6501120	yeah I think that's probably something's becoming more and more popular so
6501120	6506480	dungeon buster points out the great firewall of Russia hmm see the berry
6506480	6512160	says Putin's just upset he can't get more viewers than buzzer does he have a
6512160	6515840	twitch channel I don't know about that I know there are some Russian broadcasters
6515840	6521120	would it be like Putin plays yeah Putin plays I don't know maybe maybe which are
6521120	6524160	there any political leaders who you would watch if they had a twitch channel
6524160	6529280	maybe Justin Trudeau what I would watch Justin Trudeau play retro games
6529280	6536440	absolutely probably not all right um let's move on Loki why don't we go to
6536440	6542120	your next story all right so some well the Netherlands has deemed some loot
6542120	6550560	boxes that are in popular games are considered gambling so they did a study
6550560	6555240	looking into ten different games with loot boxes and declared that at least
6555240	6560280	four of them were in violation of vetting and Gaming Act and then
6560280	6566160	apparently I thought was a total six from what I saw the biggest reason for
6566160	6569960	the decision they said that these four games allowed the the sale and trade of
6569960	6577120	items externally through websites giving the items a market value six other games
6577120	6580800	that were studied which were not in violation of laws but we're still
6580800	6589560	heavily criticized for their addictive qualities they didn't state which games
6589560	6596080	were studied although with the speaking with the broadcast company nos they said
6596080	6603520	that they brought a Dota 2 rocket League pub gene FIFA 18 as examples of loot
6603520	6609280	boxes breaking the law and said offering these type of gameplay chances
6609280	6616000	to Dutch players without a license is prohibited so interesting and also
6616000	6619280	something to keep in mind is that the US is not the only country that's gonna
6619280	6622320	have something to say on these loot box issues and certainly we've referenced
6622320	6625680	many times that China kind of put out those odds laws where they had to
6625680	6628800	publish the odds there it's going to be interesting as these other companies
6628800	6631880	weigh in on how they want loot boxes handled because many of these games are
6631880	6637280	sold in many places besides just the US and you know Canada and stuff yeah so
6637280	6642360	that'll be interesting alright one story I want to talk to you guys about is
6642360	6647880	about a game a fan game that's coming out called the 13th doll the 13th doll
6647880	6653960	is going to be referencing old-school CD-ROM games like FMV full motion video
6653960	6659320	type games it's actually a seventh guest fan game so the 13th doll is trying to
6659320	6663840	recapture the I just say that very much for seventh gas yeah it is it's at the
6663840	6668800	13th all a fan game of the seventh guest so anyway it is going to return to the
6668800	6673840	mansion of the toy maker Henry stuff and we'll follow tad the seventh guest from
6673840	6678000	the previous journey and these left with scarred and racked with guilt from the
6678000	6681520	experience so he will be going back to the mansion to hopefully free the
6681520	6687240	victims anyway there's a new doctor that gets in there as well 26 unique puzzles
6687240	6690360	throughout the mansion and so on and so on they are looking to release this on
6690360	6694920	Halloween 2018 so I'm sure fans of the seventh guest will be excited about that
6694920	6698880	so they are clearly saying it's a fan game they're not trying to make it
6698880	6705680	official cannon but that is kind of neat I'm surprised legally it's okay but maybe
6705680	6708880	they got some type of permission for the original makers I doubt they're going
6708880	6713040	anywhere with it they still try to put out like seventh guest stuff on like I
6713040	6716520	know there's like a version on mobile phones and stuff yeah they've still been
6716520	6721960	trying to milk that franchise all these years later it does not age well no it
6721960	6725320	doesn't it really doesn't so it'd be interesting to see how a fan game kind
6725320	6729160	of brings a lot of that in because now it'll all be in high definition I think
6729160	6734920	yes that is definitely in low definition nowadays yes yeah it doesn't those old
6734920	6740280	CD-ROM games really didn't age well but they know what I'm sad that one CD-ROM
6740280	6744920	game I have not seen brought the steam that I used to play the shit out of was
6744920	6751520	mega race I'm surprised that they don't have a mega race game coming back I want
6751520	6757280	a mega race game yeah are there any um are there any 90s games that should be
6757280	6760760	coming back well mega race I want that uh-huh
6760760	6766760	besides that sorry besides that CD I'm thinking CD based maybe I'm always
6766760	6771560	Sierra adventures but those are really FMV is he said phantasmagoria yeah that
6771560	6774840	of course is kind of alleged I thought that I can't that was already I've been
6774840	6782800	released um I think so let's see Bobby Blackwell says sewer shark dungeon buster
6782800	6786400	says ripper with more Christopher Walken how about Gabriel Knight with more Tim
6786400	6791160	Curry although that wasn't really an FMV game either was it oh he just voiced a
6791160	6795920	character in that game how about the old making the video stuff from Sega CD oh
6796080	6801720	god the crisscross and you know what music factory I have the marky mark one
6801720	6806840	and the crisscross one you need to eat the CNC music factory one wasn't there a
6806840	6811040	CNC one I think there was another one that was like the last one yeah someone
6811040	6814600	wants to send me the CNC one so my collection will be complete whoopty shit
6814600	6818920	but you know yeah all right anyway before we get to your calls at orange

6841960	6847520	hopefully there's no see but they always buy this by the ads of our by this thing
6847560	6852000	all right hold on let's let's get to it
6854120	6860480	like sands through the hourglass so are the days of our lives so are the drama
6860480	6866960	of our twin galaxies oh gosh see a Billy Mitchell is fighting back against twin
6866960	6872840	galaxies yeah they removed all of his stuff and he's like well fuck you but
6872840	6879920	probably nicer you know with some hot sauce added to it he is taking experts
6879920	6885680	under to his home to show them his Donkey Kong loading screens so they can
6885680	6889400	see that they are the real arcade loading screens and not emulator he's
6889400	6896120	inviting strangers into his home to inspect his Donkey Kong girl and he also
6896120	6903240	wants to find witnesses for his high score the one million sixty two thousand
6903240	6908160	eight hundred points that was at the boomers in Diana Beach so or sorry
6908160	6914560	Dania Beach so um good luck I mean if he can do it that's great I don't see how
6914560	6918440	showing them what his system looks like now because they can compare loading
6918440	6923640	screens with the ones he sent in I get that but like it's been several years he
6923680	6927560	could have replaced the hardware in that cabinet since then I mean that's by no
6927560	6932600	means a definitive oh well he didn't cheat I guess this video is just lying
6932600	6938720	to us Elmore chart in our chat room says Billy Mitchell will win through the

6985280	6990960	yes the best scene they had in there was like they were talking about like
6990960	6995560	something about like food or something I don't remember like how they would get
6995560	7002440	how they would you know attract ladies to the ladies night thing in a bar or
7002440	7005680	something like that and for summary of singles night how they would track
7005680	7009720	ladies at singles night and for some reason the dude that was answering the
7009720	7014560	question and I don't know why thought he said seagulls night and so he's like

7028420	7031840	lounge radio all one word on Skype I love this oh my god this parody is so
7031840	7035160	like high concept I love it do you understand this reference here in our
7035160	7040560	chat see it to bury in chat says my name is dark Sakura my journey is
7040560	7044980	continuing a journey that I hope will open the doors of life to me and link my
7044980	7049680	past with my future a journey that will bring me to a strange and dark place to
7049680	7054720	the edge of the sea high atop n7 studios a house called Robin Allen's place a
7054720	7059120	world I've never known with people I've never met people who tonight are still
7059120	7066120	only shadows in my mind but who will soon fill the days and nights of my do
7066120	7071000	you get the reference I know I've heard it before opening to dark shadows right
7071000	7076400	right right aim is Victoria Winters yes did I mean you know what dark shadows I
7076400	7081120	never saw I never did see the Burton movie that he did a couple years ago did
7081120	7084760	did they start it off the same way with that I didn't see it actually I watched
7084760	7091640	the redo but mom was telling me she mom was totally into the the redo because
7091640	7096080	she watched dark shadows as a kid I yeah I love the dark shadows 90 reboot that's
7096080	7100200	like the only one I've seen start to finish and boy is it a cliffhanger
7100200	7104860	finish like that was some bullshit but the the dark shadows remake on in the
7104860	7108760	90s again if you want to take us back to games orange launch radio all one word
7108760	7113920	on Skype the dark shadows reboot in the 90s that aired like while the Gulf War
7113960	7117520	started you remember that and that was all happening nice so it wasn't really
7117520	7120280	able to find its audience because it kept getting bumped and moved around and
7120280	7124000	stuff because of ongoing Gulf War coverage so that show kind of got
7124000	7134640	screwed did you know that I think it was the CW or was it before they they merged
7134640	7141200	into the new net wait wait it what was it called wb the WB so I think the WB
7141240	7145360	back when it was that wanted to do a dark shadows reboot and they made a
7145360	7149220	pilot and everything but they didn't pick it up to series but you know like
7149220	7153100	the bread and butter of CW is a lot of those like the Vampire Diaries no like
7153100	7156920	the DC comic show yes now that yeah there's tons of that so good they took
7156920	7160420	Supergirl they've got arrow I mean the all that stuff I would think dark
7160420	7163680	shadows would fit in really well with that type of lineup so I'm just I'm
7163680	7170000	really surprised they didn't end up making a show about a QPN no UPN well I
7170080	7176660	mean that was I mean UPN and WB merged and became CW except UPN had like no
7176660	7180680	shows left by the time they said they had they got top model for a few years
7180680	7185760	and what else from UPN like everything that was good on UPN went away like
7185760	7190040	Buffy moved to UPN for the last few seasons right and then of course Voyager
7190040	7194960	but those shows were done before that merger happened so I don't know anyway
7194960	7199040	see a Tiberian chat says the Burton movie is interesting but it's basically
7199080	7204600	a loving parody hmm anyway act F wants to know is the Skype line open yes
7204600	7209080	Orange Lounge radio all one word Bobby wasn't getting any calls either so could
7209080	7215040	it be Skype is no cuz he was able to call us it's weird anyway Kossett in
7215040	7221980	chat says was Voyager and deep space 9 on UPN not DC's 9 deep space 9 and next
7221980	7227840	generation were in syndication so a lot of your TV networks that became UPN kind
7227840	7233080	of picked that stuff up cuz I know here those are all on Fox 40 back in the day
7233080	7236560	but they were like Saturdays in the afternoon was when those those shows
7236560	7242300	aired like back-to-back but but that was before Fox had football when they really
7242300	7249500	took off as a network so it was the early years I guess Elmo chart in our
7249500	7254760	chat says I was a bit a bit of a goth in the 90s my mom was like let me tell you
7254760	7258160	about this thing I watch called dark shadows and my little mind was blown
7258160	7262400	yeah I mean dark I mean even the original soap opera was really kind of
7262400	7267640	rad for its time you know it was made in what the 70s right did it start in the
7267640	7271040	late 60s or did it start in the mid 70s I want to think it was the 60s but I'll
7271040	7274920	find out give me a sec yeah so and then you know it's about its dark shadows is
7274920	7279400	basically vampires and magic and all this stuff but like in a soap opera I
7279600	7286800	don't think anything ever really matched it until my 1960s 1966 through 1971 okay
7286800	7291360	my fave soap opera ever and yes I watched the soap opera for quite some
7291360	7296360	time this soap opera was fucking amazing do you know what it is star Sakura you
7296360	7304760	got to know what it is it was on NBC the late 90s really over the top holy crap
7304760	7311400	because that was when mom was still it had Haley Mills sister in it fuck
7311400	7319560	passions oh yeah that show was so fucking great because it was just like
7319560	7325280	it was straight-up badly it was parody it was so bad it was good it was so good
7325280	7329640	good job chatters kaijuto casa and see it to bury all light up there with
7329640	7334480	passions yes with Tabitha and Timmy I distinctly remember an episode where
7334520	7342840	Tabitha tied somebody to the train tracks and that was the drama that show
7342840	7346200	is so fucking good I wish they bring it back they need to make a movie out of
7346200	7349880	passions that's what I need to do anyway we got a call let's go to it hi you're
7349880	7352920	on orange lounge radio who's this
7353360	7360040	hello it's orange lounge radio and you are you might be muted good caller now
7360040	7368600	would be the time to unmute yourself I feel like I hear chatting I hear typing
7368600	7376520	but the person isn't talking okay sorry hi is this act F'd yeah it's
7376520	7382480	exact F'd surprise how are you don't know what happened there but anyways
7382480	7385440	that's all right you had an out-of-body experience for a moment what's on your
7385440	7391360	mind buddy yeah anyways I could talk to us about so many stuff that you probably
7391360	7396720	talked to tonight but I was so distracted with another thing I want to
7396720	7402360	talk about Pokemon go we touched on Pokemon go but what's what's your
7402360	7406160	experience what do you want to talk about with it especially about the
7406160	7412880	missions they have right now with with with the mythical missions and also the
7412920	7419000	field research mission I'm still working on that goddamn meal I got the stupid
7419000	7426640	ditto I evolved the Magikarp thanks to the the Kanto event we just had I was
7426640	7431560	able to get enough Magikarp candy that wasn't so hard now I am stuck on the 10
7431560	7438320	raids and that's actually pretty easy to do you can't cheese it anymore you can't
7438480	7444000	no you have because now it doesn't it counts the raid when you feed your raid
7444000	7448640	pass it doesn't count the raid when you fail the raid over and over and over
7448640	7454400	again I didn't know that yeah so I actually have to do 10 raids so which is
7454400	7458560	fine I bought one of the boxes that had like 16 raid passes in it but it's like
7458560	7462160	I'm not gonna go out of my way to do raids I don't want to do just to get
7462160	7466820	this stupid achievement does that make sense oh yeah that at least that's like
7466860	7473260	the easy part in that in those missions because yeah the Magikarp one was
7473260	7479020	probably the hardest one finding the ditto was the hardest for me yeah without
7479020	7483300	counting the ditto one though oh although for me it was kinda easy
7483300	7489460	because I did it pretty much instantly yeah obviously it was luck but still
7489460	7493700	I'm not in a rush for Mew because real chat even though Mew is an awesome
7493700	7497060	Pokemon and has a good story behind it and the fact that you know especially
7497060	7501260	with the first movie and everything and its status is a mythical Pokemon it's
7501260	7505900	actually not a good Pokemon in the game like it's not a very powerful Pokemon
7505900	7508940	it's not one you're gonna use I don't even think you can put it in gyms or
7508940	7515180	anything so I'm not really in a rush until they say like Celebi's coming or
7515180	7520100	Mew is end dated or something like that then I will rush to finish it but right
7520140	7525660	now I'm just kind of taking my sweet ass time yeah I also took my time with it
7525660	7531340	although I already had it but it's the what I want to talk about about the
7531340	7537100	missions especially it's the the fact that it brings a lot of new life to the
7537100	7543900	game I didn't stop playing Pokemon go any time since it launched back in 2016
7543900	7549660	so right now I'm still playing it every day but trying to do the missions it's
7549660	7555340	like a new incentive to play it's something that it needed the the game
7555340	7561120	needed a long time ago oh yeah no it's definitely put more into the game
7561120	7564700	breathe more life in it like I really try to get those daily stamps done
7564700	7569180	although man sometimes those quests you get are ridiculous like oh yeah spin
7569180	7572780	three pokey stops you haven't spun before like I get I get what they're
7572780	7577700	doing with that but like I've I've hit a lot of because of Ingress and stuff I've
7577700	7581420	hit a lot of pokey stops in this town like there's very little I haven't done
7581420	7588140	unless I actually just got a new portal accepted in OPR in Ingress like three
7588140	7595280	days ago and it is now a pokey stop at a park not far from my work so that I was
7595280	7598540	able to spin that as a new pokey stop great I got to do that three times so
7598540	7602420	like that's hard to do and then I hate the one that's a three Oddish or Bell
7602420	7606060	Sprout because I never see those things anyway I mean the Kanto event was one
7606060	7610180	thing they were everywhere the Oddish I had one that was three like Trico's or
7610180	7616180	like something else it was like that one tree oh and market so with those like I
7616180	7620860	just throw them away and go to another pokey stop but you know it's like the
7620860	7624660	battle in a raid or throw two nice throws in a row or what I have one right
7624660	7629160	now I have two I have two instances of catch three insects so I'm earning them
7629160	7633420	both at the same time okay there you go yeah
7633420	7639140	seriously I also have that one too that the bug one and I also have one to hatch
7639140	7645620	three eggs and I already hatched one so that's gonna be eventually done but yeah
7645620	7649660	that's the good thing about the the field missions that you can just throw
7649660	7653340	them away if you don't want to do them or can't do them because there's also
7653340	7660660	one I have gotten to that's catch one dragon and well like really really
7660660	7667020	Niantic if you can you can do that if you're gonna do a latios raid because
7667020	7673060	that is a dragon yeah yeah but still it's like since I don't have too much
7673060	7678700	time to play during the day because of work I barely can do any rates like in
7678700	7684380	at least in the weekdays only on weekend so I prefer to yes throw them away and
7684380	7687820	and do another mission yeah that's fair yeah I've been really like I'll just
7687820	7691420	throw it away to get something I know I can do because I I have gotten my stamp
7691420	7695060	every single day since the start of this and every single moltres that's come
7695060	7700780	with it my assumption is they'll rotate it out next month I have a feeling it is
7700780	7704380	on a monthly rotation because didn't this whole thing start though this whole
7704380	7707860	thing started right at the end of March right like wasn't like the first week
7707860	7712300	March 28 March 29 so here's the thing I bet the way they did it I bet Articuno
7712300	7717900	was March's reward but because you couldn't finish it in March it went
7717900	7721140	right into the next reward which is moltres because this is the same order
7721140	7724900	the legendaries rolled out in the game with the exception of Lugea but they
7724900	7729060	just brought Lugea back to raids not that long ago so I bet next month this
7729060	7733500	might be get guests we're gonna get Zapdos next month they'll realize the
7733500	7737340	fuck up they made and then do Articuno at that point again and then it'll move
7737340	7741940	into the Lions and this is how people in areas where they complain they can't
7741980	7745220	raid all the time this is how they're gonna get their legendaries because they
7745220	7749340	did make it the raid legendaries are still better especially if you can get
7749340	7753500	weather boosted because you're gonna get either a level 20 or if you can do a
7753500	7757860	weather booster to 25 from a raid the ones you get from these catch sequences
7757860	7762740	are only level 15 but it's better to have a level 15 Pokemon than none at all
7762740	7769540	oh definitely yeah and I'm waiting for Zapdos because it's the only one of the
7769540	7775300	birds yes the only one I don't have so I really want to complete my pokey decks
7775300	7781060	at least without the regionals so yeah it's I'm really waiting for that and
7781060	7786300	also I've been doing my missions every day and I have that in yeah also every
7786300	7790940	single moltres even though they don't they kind of suck with IVs and all that
7790940	7795620	stuff but yeah I really don't care that much but let's still yeah it's more
7795620	7798900	about the pokey decks than it is necessarily having the strongest Pokemon
7798900	7803020	I'm totally with you like I would love to see them put the regionals like I
7803020	7806780	would love to see you know as they're expanding into gen 3 for you know at
7806780	7810140	some point they're gonna put more region lock stuff in those gens so you know
7810140	7814820	what it's time to go back to gen 1 and do some quest rewards that give us mr.
7814820	7818600	mime and Kangaskhan and the things we don't have yet you know let the other
7818600	7821900	countries get taro's and so forth it would be that would be great I'd love
7821900	7827860	that yeah me too don't know if you have heard about the earth date thing they
7827860	7832120	did oh yeah I heard that was that was happening did did the results come in
7832120	7837300	for that I don't know actually I was gonna ask you if you know if you knew
7837300	7842860	anything about it because it was rumored that if the goal was reached we could
7842860	7848700	have maybe got get Kangaskhan or maybe mr. mime for for unlock oh like maybe
7848700	7852860	that's gonna be the incentive or whatever is doing the earth day stuff I
7852860	7856420	don't know I'm checking the still road read it and I haven't seen anything
7856420	7860020	about it yet so I imagine they'll make they'll make it now so we earth day
7860020	7863740	progress is there any way to track the progress of the earth day goals haven't
7863740	7867780	heard anything on their website every single event is full so realistically
7867780	7871600	they have to unlock the top set of rewards within 48 of hours of the event
7871600	7876740	ending so some places didn't have anything organized when the trainers got
7876740	7884580	there oh so who knows we'll see I guess we'll find out maybe tomorrow when the
7884580	7891140	workday starts Niantic will put out a tweet now hopefully yeah all right
7891140	7893740	awesome well if there's nothing else act-deaf I think I'll go ahead and let
7893740	7898860	you go anything else you want to talk about no that was it all right sounds
7898860	7902460	good buddy I'm gonna let you go have a good day okay you too all right bye

7906660	7910180	with last-minute stories or anything they want to talk about I'm having the
7910180	7919260	worst time in the universe finding a Tron shirt a Tron shirt yep is there a
7919260	7923500	way you could get one from Shanghai Disney because they have the Tron ride
7923500	7926940	there so I imagine they've got merch to go with it I'm looking for something to
7926940	7933060	Disney bound and I found the Hurley dress I'm being resold but it's not Tron
7933060	7938900	enough yeah so I bet I was thinking I mean the whole reason this comes up is
7938940	7943220	because I have been on a Tron kick kind of to the point where I'm thinking about
7943220	7950460	playing Tron evolution again why not the Tron 360 game is or the 360 Tron is a
7950460	7956340	playable on Xbox one and don't have one well but they had it on ps3 and was it
7956340	7962100	on computer I think it was on PC at some point I don't know all right let's see
7962100	7965780	go into our chat over at live dog network calm act-def says also I caught

8040220	8048140	you know go game can you recommend no for a small throne is concerned it's
8048140	8053020	Android beast ingress and go on the green team but you will have to go
8053020	8057340	outside a lot for that game but that was designed for older phones other like
8057340	8061780	serious answers for rage I am kind of serious that answer though but other
8061780	8067700	suggestions for raging air for like what about your clicker games don't you love
8067700	8072180	your clicker games I played the office space one but it's just it's so blatant
8072180	8075700	with they're trying to get you to spend money type stuff I don't really know
8075700	8080460	like I used to play the card of Mario one a good suggestion from our chat over
8080460	8084740	at live dog network calm act F suggests Super Mario run which is free to try
8084740	8088500	super hexagon I think that's a very good suggestion I think you have to pay for
8088500	8093580	that one but it's like not even a dollar I think for that one let's see as far as
8093580	8098260	the mobile phone games go I know like there's a lot of ports of especially
8098260	8101460	like Square Enix stuff a lot of the old Final Fantasy games are available which
8101460	8108100	I think is pretty cool if you like music based games what like re raves plus is
8108100	8116900	available so is why is the name escape me in the moment the the other god damn
8116900	8121940	it the other neon FM that's the one try anything on neon FM you can get puzzle
8121940	8124740	fighter why you still can even though they're taking that offline pretty soon
8124740	8131660	I know a very popular one is bejeweled in the various jeweled blitz and stuff
8131660	8134700	that they have there I don't know if this is on Android but if it is you
8134700	8137980	should get trap adventure that's one of those games that will drive you fucking
8137980	8141540	crazy let's see going to chat over at live dot
8141540	8146060	fog network calm JD suggest there's a whole bunch of p-cross games Oh act F
8146060	8149660	suggests hearthstone that's a really good suggestion to you like magic the
8149660	8153980	gathering I think I think the best suggestion so far is hearthstone
8153980	8157980	pop culture says injustice to that on mobile I guess it is on mobile phones
8157980	8162300	isn't I do remember seeing something about that and pop culture says there is
8162300	8167260	a vogue league on injustice to that's pretty cool JD suggest Pokemon shuffle
8167260	8173220	which is a match three type of game so lots of suggestions anything else here

8229700	8234300	upgrading to the smartphone era some people you know like coming in a little
8234300	8238660	later than others because I know some what was in 2001 no but where there's a
8238660	8241500	picture of an actor somewhere that somebody took where the actor was still
8241500	8245020	using a flip phone was it Daniel Day-Lewis always it was somebody got a
8245020	8247980	picture like Daniel Day-Lewis on the subway and he was still using a flip
8247980	8251220	phone and that was like that that's why the tweet went viral because like oh my
