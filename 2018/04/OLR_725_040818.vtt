Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week, amidst the upper-overport pixel smoothing, Square Enix announces that graphic style will soon become a choice for Chrono Trigger.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
This is just one story in a night full of news. Welcome back to a regularly scheduled and live episode of the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
We are live once again, and welcome back to another episode of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight.

00:39.000 --> 00:49.000
Episode number 725 for this, April the 8th of 2018. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter as Skie, S-K-I-E.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
And I'm joined, as always, to talk about video games with the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Mr. Smush made the best noise.

00:57.000 --> 01:04.000
Mr. Smush is the resident cat, by the way, if you didn't know. He's my son. He's my three-year-old baby.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
He makes little noises like a piggy because he has the smush face. That's actually not why he's called Mr. Smush, it helps.

01:10.000 --> 01:20.000
But I called him Mr. Smush because, okay, Sanrio, our old cat who passed, when you would like pet her and she really loved you, she would lick. She'd lick, lick, lick. She'd lick your fingers.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Mr. Smush, what he does, if he loves you and you put your hand out, he'll just ram his whole face into your hand.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
He also does that, too.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, so I was like, oh, he's a smushing kitty, so I called him Mr. Smush.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
You know, every cat, though, that my friends have, I give a nickname, too.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Do you?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
He's Smushy.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Smushy? It's derivative.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
My friend Susan's cat, Pantera, not after the band, but because it means panther.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Okay, I still like Pantera after the band.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Her nickname is Miss Pants.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Okay.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Sanrio, I called Sanchan, or old lady.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Old lady. That was a good one.

01:51.000 --> 02:00.000
But anyway, I want to say what was hilarious about it is right when this show music starts, Mr. Smush comes in here and plops up on the guest, which is usually our guest chair, this very old chair I've had in my family for a long time.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
He plops up on the chair. All he needs is a microphone. I guess we could give him one.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Should I give Mr. Smush a microphone?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I was just thinking it was his regal throne.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Would you all be bothered by random cat noises if I give Mr. Smush a microphone?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Here we go.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I wouldn't be.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Mr. Smush, if you have anything to say, you just say it right into that microphone.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Unless he pulls, you know, cat assholeness and knocks it down.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah, he's going to knock it down. When do you guys hear that big thud later on?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
That's Mr. Smush.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
That's Mr. Smush peacing out.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
That's his opinion.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
All right.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Hey, speaking of opinions, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Hello.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
How are you? How are you?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I'm good. I'm having spicy salsa.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
I'm sorry.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
So my tongue's on fire.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
What do you need to drink?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
But it's so much better than the Pico, so.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
All right, you need to drink.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Better to have your tongue on fire than your ass on fire.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
This is true.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
I felt like you were trying to get a thought out there.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Oh, hey.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I hopped over to Loki.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Random observation. I noticed that you have taken your arcade cabinets out of the Roxas.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Okay, yes. Let's talk about that.

02:51.000 --> 03:02.000
So my little arcade cabinet collection, which really is Jamie's, like, helped me build this significantly because she found these little, they're called arcade minis and they're available, but they're only available.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Playing Dan.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
They're only available at Wal-Mart and I think Amazon.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Wal-Mart.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
But Jamie saw them all at Wal-Mart, so she texted me like, do you want them? I'm like, heck yeah.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
So she got me five of these seven machines that are up here.

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
And so I have these tiny little mini arcade cabinets with Pac-Man, Centipede, Rampage, Joust, Qbert, Frogger and Asteroids.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
So there's a story behind this, though.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah, go for it.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Dan took me to four different Wal-Marts looking for these fuckers.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I was like, I don't want to go to Wal-Mart. I don't want to go to Wal-Mart.

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
So as I'm driving home, there's a Wal-Mart that Dan hasn't been to because he doesn't really have a reason to, so I just stopped randomly.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Because you can buy fabric and I was looking at the crafty stuff, but they had them.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
So that's when I texted you and I told Dan that they had them, so I bought the first two of the LCD screens.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
I didn't get the crappy screens.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
Which I want to say was Qbert and Centipede.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, I think those were the first two you got me, yeah.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Which is funny because we've kind of been on a Qbert kick.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
And then...

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
And honestly, of those machines, here's the thing.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Even though they're all in the same collection or whatever, like there's...

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
They're all emulated.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
Well, sort of. See, here's the thing. The early, early Pac-Man and Space Invaders were the first two in the collection.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
They're not that great. They're basically game and watches.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Meaning they have the burned-in, you know...

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
LED.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Yeah, LED thing. Or LCD.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
LCD.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
LCD. Where it's already like burned in and stuff. So it's like Mr. Game and Watch.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Okay, that's what it looks like. And they're not very good.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
And then the new Pac-Man and Asteroids, kind of the same thing.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Just a color version of them.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Just a color version of Pac-Man. So they're also not very good.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
But the other ones... I only got those for completion's sake.

04:41.000 --> 04:49.000
The other ones like Joust and Qbert and Rampage, they all use like little emulated like either like ColecoVision or Atari. I don't know what versions.

04:49.000 --> 04:56.000
The version of Qbert actually, if I am correct, it is a modified version of the ColecoVision version.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
I want to see if the noise will actually come through on the mic. I don't know how well this will be.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Barely.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
It's loading, loading, loading.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
It doesn't really have the music, which is the crappy part.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Yeah.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
That was him cursing because I got hit. Anyway, there you go. A little taste of Qbert. Sorry, I thought that had music in it. I guess not.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
So it must be an old version.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah, if I remember... Well, I mean, believe it or not, I still have my ColecoVision.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
And we've played Qbert on it a couple of times. And it has like a little bit of the...

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
You know, so it does have a little bit of music, but that's why I think that this one's a modified version.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Because Qbert actually looks right. He doesn't have the vacant eyes.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
Right. And Dr. Suya says, I want to see Qbert as Konami's NES version. No, the NES version had that little introduction at the level.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
I did not care for the... And actually, if you want to see a really good comparison, though, for versions of Qbert.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
One of my favorite channels is... I think it's like Retro Wave, but he does Battle of the Ports.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
And he did every home release and arcade release of Qbert.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
Side by side. And it's a really good comparison. I really enjoyed this guy's commentary.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
SHJ100Matt says, I saw these things and was considering getting one.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Honestly, they're not bad. I mean, they're kind of hard to play.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
I think if I was like younger, if I was a younger kid, I would be super...

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Like your kids, Loki, I would think would be super into this.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Because the little joystick for the little hands.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Like anything like that.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Yeah. But for me, they're really hard to play.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
And I don't think the Pac-Man and Asteroids are very good, like I said a minute ago.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
But the others are... I mean, because they are like little tiny displays.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Little mini, mini color TVs. They work good.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Well, I did hook up the arcade cabinet again this week.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
Because I moved it to the other side of the garage, plugged it in, and hooked the computer back up to it.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Problem is, I get no display on it now.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Which I'm not surprised, because the way they built it...

06:50.000 --> 06:59.000
Basically, since it is an arcade machine, normally you have the boards screwed down to an actual piece of wood that slides in and out of the cabinet.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
So it's easy to kind of put it in there.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
But the graphics card that I have is just kind of... There's nothing really holding it into the board.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It just kind of wobbles around in there.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
So I did try to brace it up with some brackets, but it never was in there very well.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
And I think something broke there.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
And it's a really old graphics card too that may have broken.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
So I have to test it on another monitor first to make sure it's actually working.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
And it may just be simply replacing the graphics card, which I have dozens of them in my garage.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
That won't be a problem.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
And I can actually replace it with a better graphics card.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I was hoping I wouldn't have to do that, because everything was already set up and nice.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
It's just, you know, whatever.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Anyway, I'm looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
Ragenator says, if I recall correctly, the first arcade game that I ever played was Popeye.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
That's a great throwback game.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
People forget about Popeye, I think, from the 80s.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Nintendo did the arcade cabs for that too, if I remember right.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I had the Coleco version.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah, that was a great little 80s platformer that kind of disappeared with time.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Probably because of the license.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
With contemporaries though, I still preferred Kangaroo over Popeye.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
I was still a Popeye fan, but that's because of my Commodore 64 connection,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
because that's one of the earliest things I remember playing on Commodore 64 was Popeye.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
It was a Parker Brothers C64 cartridge.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
They had a very unique shape.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
My first arcade game I want to say was Pac-Man,

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
because I have a vague memory of being three and being held up by my mom's boyfriend to play it.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I want to say I have these two conflicting memories.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I'm not sure which one was first.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
My mic wasn't on, I think.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
No, you were fine.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Okay.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
It was either Tempest at a young age.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
I remember playing Tempest at a very young age with the little dial that spins.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
And then also another unique controller.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
I have a distinct remember of being at a Chuck E. Cheese in the 80s when my sister got married.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
I would have been like four or five years old, and I remember playing Crystal Castles.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
So I remember that being one of the earliest games that I played in the arcade.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Actually, I like that we're bringing up old arcade games.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
And by the way, a proper shout out to our chat room,

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of the Geeks network of vogganetwork.com,

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
And let me just say, it is great to be back tonight after essentially three weeks,

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
because we were gone two weeks ago because I was out at Bobby Black Wolf's wedding.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
And then last week was Easter, which I hope you guys had a great day off.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
We got a little sunburned.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Yeah, I heard.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
But we raised a lot of money for a charity.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Congrats.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
And I got to meet all kinds of sisters.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Good.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Including one of my inspirations, Sister Berenze.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Oh, I know Sister Berenze.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
You met Roma, right?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Oh, yeah.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
I love Sister Roma because of the Facebook campaign.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
I thanked her for that one.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Sister Roma is actually the first sister I ever met in 2006 at the Castro Street Fair.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And for those that don't know, just a quick background.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Jamie's part of this organization, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
Honestly, the easiest way I could explain it to the broad audience that listens to this show.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
What's that?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Drag nun.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
Yeah, basically, if you've ever seen dudes dressed as nuns, although not only dudes, right, Narsara?

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
If you've seen dudes dressed as nuns, it was probably them.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Yeah, been around since the 70s.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
So, cool.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
And Sister Roma is one of the most famous because of the Facebook campaign where, you know,

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
you should not have to use your real name.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Which I don't use my real name on Facebook and I shouldn't have to.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
But if you go look on the World of Wonder YouTube channel, you can find Sister Roma

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
and Sister Berenze doing besties for cash.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
How else will they be able to get accurate information for all their analytics that they're

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
leaking to the world?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I know, right?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Right about now, I'm real happy I used a fake name.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Thanks.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
But anyway, not to distract.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
What were you going to mention before the Easter thing?

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Do you remember?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I guess not.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
And it was something that would have been important, but I forgot.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Let me quickly read a couple more memories from our chat room.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Let's see.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Ragenator says, I never played the NES version.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
It wasn't until I had a PS3 when I finally played a home version of Qbert.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Oh, sorry.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Dartesuja says, I vaguely remember my first arcade game.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
I remember going to Bullwinkles and that was still a thing.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I love Bullwinkles.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Like, I remember a Noah's Ark game randomly, though.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
There was a Noah's Ark game.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I remember the mineshaft here had it locally.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
That place was awesome when it was...

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
I love Bullwinkles.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Probably better than Chuck E. Cheese.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
I don't think I ever went to Bullwinkles.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
We never had one where I lived.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Bullwinkles is a Bay Area thing, right?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
He was.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Yeah.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
But I did remember, and this is, and to this day I still suck at Frogger if I'm not wearing

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
roller skates, but I would go to the Babalu in Dothan, Alabama when I was there to visit

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
my daddy and my granny.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
And the Babalu was owned by a man named Bob and his wife, Lou.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
But Bob taught skating with my granddaddy, so he knew who I was and would always play

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
the songs I'd ask.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
But I would play a ton of Frogger and early pinball on roller skates.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
It was the only way I could play certain things is on roller skates to this day.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
So, just saying.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Good time.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I remember playing Spy Hunter on roller skates.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Anyway.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Well, since we're talking about old games, that actually leads into a little bit of the

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
kickoff topic I want to talk about tonight.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
I do want to give a shout out, though, to PAX East.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
I was hoping to maybe get somebody on the show who'd been to PAX East this weekend,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
but my Twitter calls went unanswered.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
But to be fair, I didn't think of it until the last minute, and a lot of people are probably

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
traveling back from PAX East right now.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
But if you didn't go to PAX East, I hope you had a great time.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
I haven't been in, what was the last time I went?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
2014, I think?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
My years start to blur together.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Whatever year the snowmageddon was, like, two weeks before PAX East.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
That was the last year I went.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
And, you know, it's getting to be a real crowded show, but it was always a good time.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
So, you know, hope people that went had a good time.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
So I just want to get that out there.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
But what I do want to talk about here at the top of the show, I want to talk a little bit about old school.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
And I want to talk about homebrew developments for old school consoles.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
And when I say old school, how about the Mattel Intellivision?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Y'all remember the Intellivision?

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
Because they keep milking the Intellivision later on for retro collections and all that, right?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
With the Intellivision Lives was a game at one point.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
They had the Flashback console.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
In fact, I think I actually own that one, the Intellivision Flashback.

13:07.000 --> 13:14.000
Well, the reason why I bring back up the Intellivision is that just recently there was a new game released for the Intellivision.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
That's right, Princess Lydie.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I hope I'm saying that right.

13:18.000 --> 13:26.000
But Princess Lydie is kind of like a Snow Brothers, a Bubble Bobble-esque type of game that was released for the Intellivision.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
And yeah, so you can check that out. The game is freely available.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
But of course, you know, the developer would always appreciate a little bit of support if you do like that.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
The game was created with Inti Basic, which is a basic interpreter for the Mattel Intellivision.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
You can actually see, here's a little gif here in studio of the game in motion there.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
So you can check that out.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
There's more information over at the Atari Age forums.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Atariage.com.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
And Bobby's asking for a spelling of that, so you can Google it.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
Absolutely. It's Princess L-Y-D-I-E.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
Princess Lydie? How about Lydie? Because it has die in it.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
So, L-Y-D-I-E.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Maybe it's Lydie.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
Lydie? I mean, I almost said Lydia, but Lydie? Oh well.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Anyway, there you go. You can check out that old game.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
And why I thought I'd bring that up is kind of a two-part question here is that

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
Why do you think these old, old consoles still thrive with new releases and new games?

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
What do you think possesses people to make games for the Intellivision when

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
I would say very few people have those hooked up to their TVs anymore?

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
It's the big N-word. Nostalgia.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Nostalgia? Nintendo? Nintendo Nostalgia?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Just Nostalgia.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Nostalgia. Something about that.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
Jamie, do you play any of these remakes, or I guess demakes if you will?

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Or old, old games on systems?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Like Halo 2600. Did you give that a try?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
No. No.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
What do you think about the fact that new games still come out?

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
I had the Bayonetta down make.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Oh yeah, that was cool.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
That was pretty fun. That was very cool.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Fantaz says, make a new Grand Theft Auto for Atari 2600.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
Funny enough, that's actually how Retro City Rampage started.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
It was a Grand Theft Auto game for the NES, a demake.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
And then it just kind of blew up from there.

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
I would love for them to do the, I guess, emulator that they did for building Breath of the Wild.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Oh yeah.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Wouldn't that be nice?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Yeah.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I'd play the shit out of it.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
That'll never see the light of day, but you never know.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
Well let me ask, and speaking of, okay, let's talk about demakes.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Because remakes are all the rage, right?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
We had Crash Bandicoot just got a remaster.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
There's another one I'm sure you all are thinking of that we'll talk about a little later on tonight.

15:39.000 --> 15:45.000
Heck, even the Halo trilogy got re-released on the Xbox One, right?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Actually, I think it was four Halo games that were re-released on Xbox One.

15:47.000 --> 15:54.000
So anyway, all that aside, what game do you think should be demade?

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
What game do you think they need to revisit and do an old version of for an old console?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
And I open this to the chatters as well.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Halo 2600 would be an example of this.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
The Bayonetta demake that they did to promote Bayonetta on stream.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
That's also another great example of that.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
What game do you think should be demade?

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
Final Fantasy VII for the NES as an example, says Bobby Blackwolf.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
Maybe do Final Fantasy VII as a text adventure a la Gemstone.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Oh, a text adventure game, like Zork.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah, like Zork.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Okay, I like that.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
What about other...

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I think they should do a...

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
I don't know why, but my mind goes to what's all the rage right now in gaming.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I say 1 versus 100.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
The player-verse, and I don't mean the game show, sadly.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
But the Player Unknown Battlegrounds and Fortnite.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
That shit's all the rage right now.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
So I would like to see a 100 versus 1 type of game, unlike the NES.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Like a party game.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
You have to have a lot of multi-depths.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
So what was that like?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Hide and go seek.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
It was something... I remember the name now.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
It was like Xeno... Xenophobe?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Was it Xenophobe?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
There was one that had a top and a bottom screen,

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
and you could see different things going on.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Yeah, okay, so there was a game called Xenophobe,

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
and it was actually three layers in the arcade,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
because it was a three-player game, and it was a side-scroller.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
And the thing that made that game very novel

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
was that all three people were in the spaceport somewhere,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
and all kind of like... I guess, yeah.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
So it was kind of like fighting.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
You know what game also that draws to mind?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
You know what game Xenophobe was a lot like?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Spy versus Spy.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Remember that one?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
And that was just two people,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
but that was very much like a split-screen thing,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
and you would try to hide the booby traps.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
So okay, go with that.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
So Spy versus Spy, but like 100 people.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
That would be fun.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Yeah.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
There you go.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Let's see.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Alan Alchemy suggests BeatMania 2DX 2600.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Played with the paddle.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Get it? Because it's a turntable and a button.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I like that. That's a good idea.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
DJ Hero has been demade.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Well, DJ Hero was.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
DJ Hero was? For what system?

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
PC. It looked like a NES version.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. You're right.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
They did like a promo thing for that.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Jamie, were you about to say something?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Parappa.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Parappa the Rapper?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
The reason why I'm thinking about it is because

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
there was the scene where he goes into the cartridge,

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
and the worse you do, the worse the graphics get.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
You know, it degrades by 8 bits each time.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
And I was going to say, demade BeatMania.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
That's basically the Game Boy Color version of the game.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Ah.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
WonderSwan version.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Dr. Buster says, I'd play Final Fantasy 13 again

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
if it was turned into a 16-bit Super Nintendo game,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
like their Lightning Returns trailer.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
You know, they did a little joke with Final Fantasy 14

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
and that as well, where they had a group fighting Titan,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
and it was really funny because the Dragoon

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
fell off the stage because it's kind of poking fun

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
at Dragoons being bad.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Fine, and I want Final Fantasy 14 done like

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Fantasy Star Online.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
So like, maybe the Dreamcast.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
Sia Tabiri in chat says, Tiger,

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
I don't know if that's a throwback at the old LCD games,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Five Nights at Freddy's.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
That's pretty good. I like that.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
And that would work, like just the little hallways

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
being on the LCD screen.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
On the game.com. I'm sorry, game.com.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
I like that Five Nights at Freddy's is a great choice

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
because so many sequences in that game are already retro,

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
like some of the storytelling.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Have you seen the trailer for Outlast for the Switch?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
No.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
So they did like a trailer and there's like this dude

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
sitting in the cafe, all of a sudden there's like a jump scare

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
and he's like, ah!

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Looking around like everyone's like, the fuck, dude?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Nice.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says there was also Guitar Hero 2

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
that's played more like Audio Surf.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Yeah, so that's, okay.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
So, any other demakes you guys want to get out there

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
before we move on with the game?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I'm trying to think of other stuff that's really big right now.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
It's funny because I keep thinking of Minecraft,

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
but Minecraft already has that look of an old game,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
although it's 3D, so it's not old.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
What if Minecraft was done kind of like Doom style?

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
Where it was all pixel done in 3D?

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
I was like, that's kind of how it looks already.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
But it is actually 3D, like all of your characters are just 2D flat.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Oh, okay, I see what you mean.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
And your extra assets are 2D flat.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
It's Terraria.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
But Terraria is like side view.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Wolfenstein 3D is a good example because that was a 2D game

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
in three dimensions.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Right, or like Hexen or Heretic.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Okay, I see where you're going.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
You know, all those id software games.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
MXC brings up a good point.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
Brazil has a lot of demakes due to the continued popularity

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
of Sega Genesis.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
And Sega Master System is the big thing.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I think they finally moved on to Genesis.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
But a lot of games that came out on Genesis and later systems

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
actually have Master System ports.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
You can only get them in Brazil.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
You know, and sometimes we forget being that we're in the US

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
and so we're one of the countries that tends to get stuff

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
right when they come out.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
There's a whole globe here,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
and a lot of these countries in South America

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
and other parts of the world too,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
they don't necessarily get stuff.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Like, you know, the PlayStation 4.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Did Mr. Smoosh finally knock the mic over?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Mr. Smoosh knocked it over.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
He had it.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
All right, anyway, so a lot of these other countries

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
don't have stuff right away.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
So they have to kind of...

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I bet there's a big, like, secondhand market too.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Like, I bet like GameStop, like the overage shit they can't sell,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
they probably send to other countries

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
or they, you know, sell it to places in these other countries.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Well, and the other thing too is that the cost of import

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
for some of the newer systems is so great

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
that it ended up being more cost effective

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
to downgrade some of the games.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
I mean, like, there's, I think, two iterations of Sonic the Hedgehog

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
other than the Game Gear one

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
that came out on Master System only in Brazil.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
You know, we've got...

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
We emulated a few of them.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
I mean, they're pretty fun, but still.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Yeah.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Fantasm Chat says,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I know people from Brazil.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Everything is so expensive there, it's ridiculous.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
A hundred plus dollars for a game.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Yeah, I'm sure with all the importing, you know, fees

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
and then people want a cut of that and so forth,

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
I'm sure it's, you know, if the company doesn't officially exist there,

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
then you're basically paying import surcharges on everything,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
so I'm sure it gets crazy.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
All right, anyway.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Okay, that was a fun little conversation

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
since I know remakes are all the rage right now to talk about remakes.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Actually, speaking of Halo 2600, I did watch the making of that.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Like, there was, like, someone did a documentary on it

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
about how it was a guy at Rare, or not Rare, at Bungie

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
that basically, like, I just want to mess around

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
with making a game for the 2600.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
It doesn't matter what it is,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
and then you end up just drawing Master Chief.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Showed it to somebody, like, dude, you got to make that.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
You got to make the whole game.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
And so eventually, you know, you worked on it with some other people

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
to help, you know, build the sprites and everything.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
You know, going back to the earlier question on why demakes,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I bet the challenge is it for a lot of people.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Yeah.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Because, you know, programming an Atari 2600 game,

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
like, you really have to, you can't write bloated code.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
I hope he knows how to write assembly.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah, right.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
You really, I mean, that's maybe a good way to, like, practice and stuff.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
I would have no idea how to do that stuff.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Yeah, it's extremely challenging.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And, like, I think it took the guy, like, a few years just to make it.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Wow.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
It was just, it was more of just, like,

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
I want to challenge myself to be able to do this.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
But some people do it for the thrill.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Yeah.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I'm not one of those people that will ever do that for the thrill.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
Somebody in chat was saying very tongue-in-cheek

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
that you should demake It's Time to Car,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
except you'd have to actually make it first.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Oh, it's already demade.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
It's already in the trash compactor.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
All right.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
Let's talk a little more about some modern games.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
Maybe, as we travel around our gaming weeks

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
and the types of video games that we've been playing this week,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
and I say maybe because, I don't know,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
maybe Dar Sacra went on a retro binge.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
She does that sometimes.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
How was your gaming week, Dar Sacra?

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
I bought more than I played.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
I bought that.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
That's just a Monday.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I bought Valhalla, finally.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
Or the VA11, whatever, how it's spelled.

24:05.000 --> 24:14.000
I also got Res HD, or whatever the remake was on Steam,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
but I haven't played it yet.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
I went to the thrift store, found just a stack as tall as I am,

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
practically, of Xbox 360 games in really great condition.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
Ask me later which Goodwill I went to.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
And a bunch of PS3 games.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
So I picked up Ni No Kuni for PS3,

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
and I picked up an unwrapped copy of Titanfall for Xbox 360.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
It was obviously some bro's collection

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
because there were a lot of Gears of War and all that in there.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
I played some Pokemon Go.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
I played a lot of Animal Crossing.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
We, finally, I think, are done with Zelda.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
We loaned Julie in our Wii U so he can finally play it.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Oh, that's cute.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Yeah.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
And I played a bunch of Pinball

25:04.000 --> 25:10.000
because we played a four-person versus game on Medieval Madness.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
And that was really fun.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
And played some World Cup Soccer and played some Black Knight 2000.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
My Star Trek is broken.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Oh, no.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Upset.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
But we might actually sell it.

25:23.000 --> 25:29.000
I mean, it'd give us like $8,000 back in our bank, so that'd be nice.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
Oh, no, I didn't really play much else, I think,

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
because I had a Passover Seder to get ready for.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
So it was crazy.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
I heard it was successful, so congrats.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
It was.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
There were 13 people apart from myself.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Nice.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
That's a party.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
As a party.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
That is a party.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
There was so many people stuffed into my kitchen.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
All right, let me move on to Loki and your gaming week.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
So I saw Ready Player One again.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Of course you did.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
And no one surprised.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Yes.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
I just thought about myself.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
And Jamie and I are talking about going this week and Loki's like,

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Ooh, win.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Like, of course you can come, Loki.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Let's figure it out.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
So I did that.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
And then I did play Far Cry 4 or 5.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
I thought 5 was the new one.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Okay.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Yeah, Far Cry 5.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Does it have like a huge map or something?

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
It's a pretty big map,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
but I haven't actually been playing too much of Far Cry 5.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
I've been playing the Far Cry arcade stuff.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
So I've been doing that.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
And I've been doing this arcade hero mode,

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
which is basically, hey, play these maps that no one plays so you can rate them.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
And they've all been terrible.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
But it's been just fun just going through the terrible maps

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
because you also earn double experience.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
And the experience you earn in that and the perk points and stuff

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
go into the main game too.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
So like if I, it's an easy way to just earn,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
like because the aim's kind of hard right now.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
And so I just grinded that for a while.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
And then, oh, hey, look at all these perks I unlocked.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
And it makes the game easier when I actually go back and play Far Cry 5.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
But I did actually play some Far Cry 5 as well

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
because I was trying to get to this one way point on there, like this prison.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
And so I had to drive through all this area with a bunch of bad guys and stuff.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
And so there was this hunter, this hunting spot that you can go to.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
And so I went up to the hunter or whatever,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
and then she gets attacked by a mountain lion.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
And so then I waited for the mountain lion to kill her,

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
and then I killed the mountain lion.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
And I got to loot both of them. So win-win.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
And then of course more DDR. What was it?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I'm down 16 pounds now.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
And I've been playing...

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Congrats, by the way.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I've been playing doubles again.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
So I'm playing mostly doubles and doing non-stops of doubles.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
I've been finding that doing random caprice every time,

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
which is that kind of it's like you can see which songs they are,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
but it's different every time you play it.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
That's been all right.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
Anytime I try to do random all, you know, it's just like,

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
Oh, hey, let's throw in Trip Machine Survivor.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Okay, that's cool. You passed that.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Now let's throw Legend of Max in there.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
It's like, what the fuck? I mean, seriously.

27:58.000 --> 28:04.000
Can you just mix it up a bit instead of boss song, boss song, boss song?

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
So it's just, I don't know.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
And then like I said, I was setting up my arcade cabinet.

28:10.000 --> 28:16.000
And unfortunately the something with the graphics card I think is broken.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
So I get no image on the screen.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Hopefully it's not the actual screen that's broken.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
I don't think so.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I'd be more likely to believe it's the PC

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
because that graphics card is like wiggling all around in there.

28:26.000 --> 28:32.000
So I would not be surprised in the least that something's broken there.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
So I had to kind of play around, hook it up to some different monitors

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
to see if I can actually see an image and try to troubleshoot that.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
But I just thought I would set that up since it's just been sitting in a corner gathering dust.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
And eventually I'll probably sell it.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
Because I did promise I would do that when I got the DDR machine.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
So I'll have to do that because I haven't been playing it.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
And that's pretty much it.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
Okay. Let me talk about my gaming week.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Still some old favorites.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Been playing Pokemon Go.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Finally caught a Latios at one of the raids over the weekend.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
So that was good.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
Let's see, also still playing Overwatch.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Having fun with that.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Been playing a lot of Mystery Heroes.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Kind of getting back into that.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I feel like I'm just doing better.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Knock on wood.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
But I feel like I'm just getting some good matches.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
And I'm winning as much as I'm losing.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
And that feels nice.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
That's where I want to be is an even win-loss ratio.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
And continuing to play some Heroes of the Storm and Final Fantasy XIV.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
And some of the newer things that I've continued on recently.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Ni No Kuni 2 I'm still playing.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I have been streaming all of my gameplay.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I'm up to about eight and a half hours in.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
And all of it's been streamed over on my Twitch stream.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Cheap plug, Rob Roberts.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
But I'm really enjoying Ni No Kuni 2.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
It's different from the first game.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Like the battle system is completely different.

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
And there's this whole kingdom management system thing that kind of feels like a mobile phone game.

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
But it's also not because the things you do to grow your kingdom are not necessarily paying 99 cents.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
There's no money transactions in the game like that.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
But it's actually go do this quest.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
And then you'll get another person to join your kingdom.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
And I kind of like that.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
It's like Actraiser.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Kind of in that regard.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
A lot of people comparing it to Suikoden.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Where you try to get all the people to convince them to join your kingdom.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
A lot of people comparing it to that.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
But yeah, I'm enjoying that and all the side questing.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
So I'm going to continue to stream that. Play more of that.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I'm having a lot of fun with that game.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
And I did not beat the first game.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
And I do not feel like my experience on Ni No Kuni 2 is diminished.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I think it's very much like Final Fantasy.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
Where it's just, you know, they are similar in their art style and some of the location names.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
But otherwise, probably not connected.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
So, there you go.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Let's see.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
And other newer stuff I've been playing this week.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
I was trying to think. There's one other game I want to talk about.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Oh, I lost my train of thought.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
What else did I play this week?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
There was a new...

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Oh, I want to talk about DJ Max.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
Because I was just playing that earlier today actually before the show.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
Because DJ Max Respect actually had some new DLC released for it.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
So now they have the Classic Y edition.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
You can get all those songs, which is great.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
They have a Technica expansion pack.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
So yeah, I'm loving that.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Because all those songs are really good.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Especially the Classic Y pack.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Like if you have DJ Max, you want to get the Classic Y pack.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
It almost actually makes me want to go back and alter maybe what I said a little bit a couple weeks ago on OLR.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
About how DJ Max... I didn't really care for the music as much as I did in BeatMania 2DX.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
Because these expansion packs and these DLC music packs are really good.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Like the songs are really good in the DLC packs.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
Even though they're not necessarily licensed things.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
I hear that the developers are not super happy with the performance of the game in the West.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
I think you need to strongly consider...

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
I mean, they're probably having to pay a license fee for some of these DLC.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
So you might want to consider bundling some of it in.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Or you might want to consider really dropping the cost on the base game.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
I think if the base game came down to $20, probably more people would pick it up.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
And then you could probably make some more money off these DLC expansions.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
That would be my advice to the developers.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
$50, digitally only.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
It's a lot to ask for what is essentially kind of an itch thing.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I paid it because I like music games.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
And I realize it's a very well-rounded game.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
But it might be a hard sell on a greater scale otherwise.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
Yeah, that's I guess about it for my gaming week.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
So, cool.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
You can follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
As far as any housekeeping, we should be having shows pretty solid over the next couple months.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
We took a nice little two-week break there.

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
So we should be having shows right up at least through our 16th anniversary show in mid-June.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
So, just kind of a random train of thought here.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I know we're in April right now.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
When is the indie arcade? Isn't that like right around this time?

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
I'm not sure they're doing it this year, actually.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I have not seen any of the promotion for it. You're right.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
It would have been around this weekend.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
I do know that Bree actually had a baby.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Oh, yeah.

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
Yeah, so I think just probably, you know, I know she worked really hard to put all that together.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
Certainly Gabe did stuff too, but he actually released his game and so forth.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
So, I think they probably just put it on pause for this year.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
As far as saying no, I haven't heard anything official.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
Yeah, that's definitely fine. I was like, oh shit, did I forget about it?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
It would have been around this time, yeah.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
So, I think it didn't happen this year.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
So, we'll just hope it comes back this year.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
It gives me more time to work on a game.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
That's right.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
There you go.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
That's right. You can plan for next year. Absolutely right.

33:39.000 --> 33:46.000
Also, I know they had the collaborative office space that they had here.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Yeah, yeah.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
It actually closed.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Oh, that's sad.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
So, yeah, you know.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Those collab office spaces are kind of hard.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
It can be.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
It can be.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Well, I know the hacker lab downtown does really, really well.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
So, maybe there just wasn't enough demand for the second thing.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
Well, they're also sponsored by my company as well.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
That probably works.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
Our development innovation lab is literally across the street.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
But we will be keeping our eyes on the Sacramento Indie Gamer Collective.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
And anything comes up that we need to let you all know about, we will bring it up right here on OLR.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
So, cool.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
Alright, well, let's get into some gaming news then for the night.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
And we'll start with you, Loki.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Alright.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
So, Final Fantasy XV.

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
The game that I have, and I literally stared at the title card a couple days ago.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
I'm like, I should go back and play that.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Because I've only played like ten minutes of it.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
And I really should play it.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And then I went to play Far Cry 5 instead.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
So, you know.

34:42.000 --> 34:49.000
But Final Fantasy XV, you know, they were very dedicated to putting out DLC for the game.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
And that doesn't look like it's going to quit anytime soon.

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
In fact, they even outlined some new episodes that are going to be coming out over the next year for Final Fantasy.

34:58.000 --> 35:05.000
So, four new episodes are scheduled, including some that focus on Ardyn, Lunafreya, Noctis.

35:05.000 --> 35:11.000
And they said that a shorter side story episode as well for Arania Highwind.

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
And they didn't really say what exactly, you know, any details on that.

35:17.000 --> 35:23.000
But also, I guess, maybe some other multiplayer focused stuff as well.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Some comrades expansions.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
So, lots of stuff coming out next year.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
Well, I like that they're doing a DLC side story for Arania.

35:32.000 --> 35:39.000
Because, you know, she was a really strong character that seems like she kind of got cut short in a lot of the corners they cut to get the game out in a reasonable time.

35:40.000 --> 35:47.000
And that's, I don't know, that's kind of what bugs me about this whole fact that they've got these continuing, developing things through 2019.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Is I just feel like...

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
So, when's the game of the year edition going to come?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Or when's the game going to be finished?

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
So I can play through the story and get the story as it was intended.

35:55.000 --> 36:01.000
But I've been reading these hot takes on Twitter that are like, well, that's a very, you know, it's a very...

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I don't even know what word to use.

36:03.000 --> 36:10.000
It's a very spoiled perspective because the developers are continuing to support the game all this time after development.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
And we should be thankful that more developers are pouring into their game and all this stuff.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
And I'm just like, come on.

36:16.000 --> 36:24.000
Like, I fucking hate it when these types of hot takes are meant, are written in a way to make the other side, like, feel bad.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
Like, you should feel bad for your opinion that you are hating on this stuff.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
Look, I bought Final Fantasy XV when it came out.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
The developers got my money, so I can bitch and moan all I want on my Twitter.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
If you don't want me to feel bad, you should be less of a cunt.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
It's one of those things where I'm just like, okay.

36:40.000 --> 36:46.000
But I'm frustrated because I went and I played through this whole game and then it's like, oh, we're going to go back and change chapter 13.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
It's just, it's a problem nowadays.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Oh, we're going to go back and change this.

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
It's like, could you let me know when the game is just fucking done so I can play the game that's intended?

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And that is a problem.

36:56.000 --> 37:03.000
I think with a lot of these big publishers out there, it's like, okay, you get this incentive if you release the game now.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
Or, hey, we're forcing the releases now to avoid any penalties.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
And then, or you could finish it and release it later.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
It's like, well, we'll just release it now. We'll patch it later.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
It seems to be the mentality of it.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
It's the new normal.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
And it's sad that it's normal because it wasn't like that before.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
You had one chance to get it right and it had to be right.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
And that was it.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
But now it's like, ah, fuck it, whatever.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
We'll just, we'll just fix the bugs as we go along.

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
Or it's the other extreme like Mass Effect Andromeda where it's like, oh, it didn't do well.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Drop it like a hot potato.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
The DLC that was expected, not canceled.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
We'll just write a book about it.

37:44.000 --> 37:51.000
And it's like, okay, well, that's a little, see, I feel a little differently about like DLC and the additional like DLC and that stuff.

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
Because with a lot of DLC, it's usually like an extra episode.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
It's a continuation.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
It's a separation, especially in Mass Effect.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
I thought Mass Effect did this very well, especially the last one they did for Mass Effect 3.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
What was that?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Citadel? Was the name of that very last one they did for Mass Effect 3?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
The Citadel was fan service, the DLC.

38:08.000 --> 38:16.000
It was, but I loved it because it really felt like this separate experience from the game that, you know, enhanced the main game.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
And some of this in 15 they're doing.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
And I don't, you know, that's cool.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
And I'm okay with that stuff.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
But it's like the fact that they're going back and continuing to enhance things that are like in the main game.

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
That's the stuff that kind of bothers me is it's like, well, then, so you're not done with the main game.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
And it just kind of goes back to this whole like, you know, the game took years and years and years to develop.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
But we all know the real development didn't happen to the last two years.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
And then it was fucking confusing.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
Oh, by the way, you need to watch this short film in order to finally grasp everything.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
You don't. I didn't watch the short film.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
You don't need to watch it.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Why even release it?

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Some of it's like an extra thing, I guess.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
Some of it's incorporated into the game itself, I think.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
So, there you go.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Dungeonbuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

38:57.000 --> 39:05.000
speaking of Final Fantasy 15, watched some Tekken gameplay with Noctis and it's like he totally belongs there.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
I'm not surprised to hear that.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
In Tekken?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Yeah.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Noctis is in Tekken?

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Yeah, yeah. Remember that?

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
He's announced as a DLC character for Tekken 7.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
Yeah.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
I mean, that's cool.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Yeah, no, it's cool.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I wouldn't doubt that he probably belongs there.

39:18.000 --> 39:28.000
So, anybody still in, or I guess now that, was it, Dissidia came out, anybody even give a shit about that?

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
I tried the demo and I could not get into it.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
Or, I shouldn't say demo, the open beta or whatever it was they had.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
I could not get into it.

39:36.000 --> 39:42.000
Like, it was kind of complicated for a fighting game, which is fine, and I kind of like could have stuck with that,

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
but it's just, I was thinking that Dissidia would be like a Tekken type of game with Final Fantasy characters.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
It's really not that at all.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Yeah.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Yeah, so, I don't know, I just wasn't into it.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Is it too late to hold out host for an Urgats 2?

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
I mean, because...

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Yes.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Oh, damn it.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I'm not sure that Dissidia is selling very well.

39:58.000 --> 40:03.000
I could be wrong, but I'm not sure it's doing very well, so I'm not sure Square is going to continue this fighting game thing.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
So, we'll see.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
You know where they should really throw in their efforts, though?

40:07.000 --> 40:15.000
And I would be shocked if they don't try this, at least after Mario Kart comes out for iOS and Android.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
New Chocobo Racing game.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Oh, man, that I would be on board for, heck yeah.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
And I could see them doing that.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Hey, Chocobo Racing.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Put it on mobile.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Hell yeah.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
I mean, eh, but you know, hey, if that's what we got to do to get a new one.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Right.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Still, eh, but you know.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
No, I get you, I get you.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
So, alright.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Well, let's move on to something else.

40:35.000 --> 40:42.000
Although, I got to say, it's hard because when I do see people playing Final Fantasy XV on stream, I'm always like, oh, I should go and play this again.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Or they can at least make it.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
And then they see a story like this and I'm like, oh, yeah, it's not done.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
Make like a decent VR thing because that fishing thing is stupid.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Correct.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
Alright, anyway, let's talk about Spyro.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
That's right, Spyro the Dragon is making a comeback.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
That's pretty exciting.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Just in time for the 20th anniversary of Spyro.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
Spyro is going to be coming back in the Spyro Reignited Trilogy.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
The Skylander developers Toys for Bob.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
This is what they're doing now because I don't think Skylanders.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Yeah, it's done.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
So, Spyro, which makes sense because Spyro was in Skylanders, right?

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
I think that did happen.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah, it was Spyro in the Skylanders or something like that.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
It was Skylanders, Spyro, something or other.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
He was in the very first title.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
Yeah.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
And then it was like, oh, he's not the focus anymore.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Yeah.

41:29.000 --> 41:35.000
So, anyway, Spyro the Dragon, Spyro 2, Ripto's Rage, and Spyro Year of the Dragon are all going to be in this.

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
New remastered graphics and music and all that available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
The release date, September 21st.

41:43.000 --> 41:50.000
$39.99 if you want to pre-order it and I'm sure any store is happy to take your money right now for that.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
Interesting to note, these original games were actually originally developed by Insomniac Games,

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
who are now doing that big Spider-Man game that also got a release date this week, if I'm not mistaken.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Also in September.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
I think that's coming up later in the show. I might be spoiling that a little bit.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
But anyway, yeah, so that's something else to look forward to.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
So, what do you guys think about Spyro coming back?

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
I'm more excited about this than Crash Bandicoot, actually.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
I've never played a Spyro game.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Really?

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Really?

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
I was never into it.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
I played the first two, I think.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
They were solid platformers.

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
The first one was one of the first games I bought on the original PlayStation and I think that's why I'm excited to try this.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
3D cutting-edge graphics for the time, yeah.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
For the time, yeah.

42:30.000 --> 42:35.000
And that 3D platformer, it was kind of the closest thing PlayStation had to Mario 64, but it was different.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
I don't want to compare Spyro to Mario 64, but it was different.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
It was a good game.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Yeah.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.000
It's one of those games now that a lot of PlayStation games, man, you go back to them and it's like,

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
yeah, this didn't hold up that well.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
It's a pretty good game.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
But do you think with the remaster and the graphics and everything, it'll hold up a lot better?

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
Yeah, I think it'll hold up a lot better.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
I'm not buying it, but it'll hold up a lot better.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
I think I will.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
I'll buy it.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Why not?

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Is it coming out on PC, though?

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
They didn't say PC.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
They didn't say PC, but it probably will.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
It's too bad.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Did the Crash Collection come out on PC?

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
I don't know if it ever did.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
It might.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
There's another series I haven't played.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
Really?

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
You haven't played Crash Bandicoot either?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
I was never into it.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
I thought it looked ridiculous.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
And so the listeners might be thinking, watch this.

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
But you were very much a Sega girl, too, if these games weren't on Dreamcast.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Really?

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Growing up, I had a Super Nintendo.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
No, but this was after Super Nintendo.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
This would have been like your college years.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
Well, no, I never had a PlayStation when they came out.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
I didn't have access to a PlayStation until I lived with Candace.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
And I only bought one game, and that was Final Fantasy VII.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
But you did have a Dreamcast right when it came out, right?

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Well, we had a Japanese Dreamcast, and then we had...

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
And you had a 32X, right?

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Well, Dan did when I moved right here.

43:50.000 --> 43:55.000
The only remaster collection I'm interested in right now is whenever they announce a Ridge

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Racer remaster collection.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Give me a new R4.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
New R4.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I'm on board with that.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
R4 had the best soundtrack.

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, JD suggests, hold out for Switch.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
You know, there's a lot of people that are asking, where's the Switch edition of this?

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
It's probably gonna...

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
I think maybe they just didn't announce it, but it's...

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
You think it's...

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
I think it's a guarantee.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
I think it's something it'll probably happen to.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Okay, I have to say this now.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
If anyone hears burping noises in the background, it's me.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
It's you.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
It's the cat.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
It's Mr. Smooshin.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
No, it's because of my stupid digestion problems.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
So, I'm gonna burp, sorry.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
It's...

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Burp like a lady.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Girl.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
So, whatever.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Ridge Racer.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Oh, that joke will never die.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Let's see.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
Dartusia says, I thought I heard it got rated somewhere for a Switch version, but it wasn't

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
officially announced yet.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Yes, I do believe that was out there.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Was it this week?

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
I think it was...

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Was it the guy from...

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
I'm trying to remember which company.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
There was somebody.

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
I remember, because now we're talking about Ridge Racer and stuff, and that made me think

45:01.000 --> 45:08.000
of CEO Kazurai, and someone was actually following him and thought he was the actual CEO of Sony.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
And I never realized that that was a parody account or something.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Oh my god, that's funny.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
It was funny.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
I wanna say...

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
It took him this long to figure it out?

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
I don't remember.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
I think it was someone at Take-Two or 2K or something like that.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I don't remember, but it was hilarious.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
That's pretty funny.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
At least they weren't DMing secrets or anything like that.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
That's good.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
All right.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Well, anyway, let's move on past Spyro.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Oh, those shenanigans.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Shenanigans.

45:34.000 --> 45:42.000
So, we now have a new fighter entering this brawl over the net neutrality repeal, and

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
that is the ESA.

45:44.000 --> 45:53.000
So, they have jumped on in, and they are joining the lawsuit against the FCC over the repeal

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
of net neutrality.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
I need to write whoever wrote this fucking article that appeal and repeal are not the

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
same fucking thing.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Just saying.

46:03.000 --> 46:08.000
But they applied to join in, and their whole thing on that...

46:08.000 --> 46:13.000
And I'll just read the statement, going into the important part.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
In particular, broadband providers are now permitted to engage in practices that degrade

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
consumers' traffic.

46:18.000 --> 46:23.000
That, in turn, could have significant consequences for the enjoyment of multiplayer online games

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
and cloud-based gameplay services, both of which require low-latency connections to support

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
rapid and continuous interactivity.

46:31.000 --> 46:37.000
And that's assuming that the intent is to throttle and have different paid tiers, which

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
we haven't had anything lead to that yet.

46:41.000 --> 46:49.000
But, I will say this, any industry left unregulated is going to take advantage of whatever they

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
can to make the bottom line.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
We have seen this over and over in history.

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
Do not trust capitalist, you know, do not trust a capitalist society.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
They're going to fuck you for the money.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
That's just how it works.

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
Not that I want to say I'm for...

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
Not that I want to say I'm against net neutrality, because that's definitely not where my head

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
is at.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
But this is more coming from my whole, my brain is preparing for the worst, that this

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
is the reality that we're going to have to accept that they're going to get their way

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
and that net neutrality is going to be gone.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
Is it going to be as bad as people think it is?

47:25.000 --> 47:31.000
Because there's a part of me that says that the consumers getting to regulate the market

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
in some of the markets where there is competition, not here, unfortunately, we have one choice,

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
that's it.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
But in some of the more competitive places, I would think that consumers aren't going

47:41.000 --> 47:47.000
to let these companies get away with charging $10 for a Netflix bundle and all this other

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
shit.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
I don't think it's going to get nickel to dime that way.

47:49.000 --> 47:55.000
Except the thing is that the people who are part of the lawmaking process don't listen

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
to their constituents.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
They listen to the money that goes into their pockets.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
I know, I know.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
But that's why I'm like, I'm just preparing for that this is going to be the way it is

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
because...

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
I'm not looking, I'm not speculating anything about the future.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
I'm looking at the past.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
And those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
And we've seen what unregulated industry does.

48:17.000 --> 48:22.000
We've seen, I mean, again, I brought it up before, but the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
Fire, where they locked women inside to make them work.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Child labor.

48:27.000 --> 48:32.000
An unregulated industry is going to do whatever it can to make the bottom line as cheap as

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
possible.

48:33.000 --> 48:39.000
Or like we should even remember, the same goddamn industry, not just several years,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
or a couple decades ago.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Remember Ma Bell?

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
Remember when they had to break up the Bell companies because it was just this giant fucking

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
monopoly from phone service?

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Yeah.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Remember that?

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
How is Comcast not at that same point?

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
It's the same goddamn thing.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
Comcast's acquisitions haven't been as big as the whole Spectrum Time Warner.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Comcast owns a fucking network.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
They own NBC.

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
But the other ones you're looking at in terms of just internet?

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
You've got that whole series of acquisitions done by AT&T.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Yeah.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
You've got that whole series of acquisitions.

49:13.000 --> 49:18.000
Now Time Warner and Spectrum have merged, and they bought Roadrunner, they bought all

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
kinds of local ISPs.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Here's what's going to happen with the net neutrality thing.

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
And I'm building a little bit on what Bobby Blackwell said, so I want to give credit to

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
him and his show because he talked a little bit about this.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
I kind of think the data caps are going to be what comes into play with this, but in

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
a little bit of a different way than what Bobby said.

49:35.000 --> 49:40.000
Because as 4K gets more and more adopted, we're going to use more and more bandwidth.

49:40.000 --> 49:46.000
Comcast, which is the big provider out there, upped all those bandwidth tiers to 1 terabyte,

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
1,000 gigabytes.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
That's where we're at now.

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
Well, as 4K becomes more and more the standard, and as the internet gets faster and faster

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
enough to deliver 4K on demand, which is where we're going to be in five years.

49:57.000 --> 50:02.000
Well, yeah, and the internet has to get faster because my service speed hasn't gone up.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
But those data caps, they may not bulge.

50:04.000 --> 50:09.000
But here's where net neutrality and that whole thing, if it does not come back, here's where

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
that whole thing is going to get you.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
This is what Comcast is going to do.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
I don't think it's going to happen quite the same way that Bobby was saying on his show,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
but I think they will do.

50:16.000 --> 50:24.000
They're going to say, oh, but through Xfinity and our movies and our phone service and the

50:24.000 --> 50:30.000
things that are through Comcast, we're not going to put towards your data caps.

50:30.000 --> 50:36.000
So if you use your 4K movies through Xfinity, what do they call the Comcast TV thing?

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
Is that what it is?

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
I don't know.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
X1 or whatever.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
X1.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
If you do it through that, it won't count towards the data cap because they kind of

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
did that before.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
AT&T did that before.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
I think T-Mobile does that right now or Verizon.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Somebody does that with theirs.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Oh, yeah.

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
So that's, and that whole thing is that it's like, oh, if you stay in our ecosystem and

50:56.000 --> 51:02.000
you are buying your movies on demand through us and not through Apple TV or something like

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
that, then it won't count towards data cap.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
But if you go out to Apple TV or you go out to Amazon Prime and you buy it there, oh,

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
that's going to count towards data cap.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
I don't think, because I don't think the market is going to let, I mean, I totally

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
respect your perspective and everything.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
And again, I want to reemphasize, I want net neutrality to come back.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
I'm trying to deal with what is the future going to look like.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
Well, even if it doesn't come back, I'm hopeful with this.

51:25.000 --> 51:31.000
It seems like a lot of states are pushing for their own utilities for this stuff, which

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
it really should be.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
You know something like that's going to pass here.

51:33.000 --> 51:38.000
Yeah, it really should be something that's like a utility that basically, you know, put

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
it through the power system or something like that.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
You know, they have the whole new internet over power type stuff.

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
Azet in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, get rid of pie.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Yes, that smug motherfucker.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
I fucking hate that guy.

51:53.000 --> 51:59.000
The one guy that won't fucking leave Washington.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
Well, he's in trouble right now for the whole Sinclair stuff.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
That's a whole other ball of shit.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
I'm just going to put it this way.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
We have elections this year.

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
There's another series of elections, of course, in 2020.

52:16.000 --> 52:22.000
And there are enough people who hate those motherfuckers right now that we're going to see a big change.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Make it happen, people.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
You need to vote.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
If you live in this country, you need to vote.

52:29.000 --> 52:34.000
I'm not going to tell you how to vote, but you need to, and not just vote for whoever has a cool name.

52:34.000 --> 52:41.000
You need to go vote for, although, like, you know, if somebody, you know, named like Rob Roberts was actually running for office, I probably would do that.

52:41.000 --> 52:49.000
But anyway, no, seriously, you need to do your research and know, like, what are these candidates and, you know, know where they stand and know that they are like four things you want.

52:49.000 --> 52:58.000
Because when people don't vote, then people get a say that you may not want to have the say, but they have the say because they voted.

52:58.000 --> 53:05.000
So the other the other thing, too, is, I mean, we definitely because I think this is a big part of it.

53:05.000 --> 53:11.000
That's the only reason I'm bringing it up. But we need to have caps on lobbying as well.

53:11.000 --> 53:21.000
You know, lobbying needs to be on equal terms without there being because that's how we get, you know, I would I would be what with 100 percent certainty.

53:21.000 --> 53:28.000
The whole reason that neutrality repealed is because the ISPs are paying lobbyists to make them think that this is right.

53:28.000 --> 53:33.000
They're getting a lot there. They're being legally bribed is what it is.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
And in chat, there's talk about the whole Oprah for president.

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
She won't do it. No, no more celebrities in government.

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
No more like seriously. When was the last good celebrity in government?

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
There was. OK, maybe Jesse Ventura.

53:50.000 --> 53:58.000
Depending on where you are politically. I would even give and look, as as somebody who does lean left, I would not usually name Ronald Reagan, but I will give you that.

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
I realize a lot of fucked up the economy. I realize a lot of people are fans.

54:02.000 --> 54:08.000
I will give you that. But that was in the 80s. Reagan fucked up our economy. Maybe Sonny Bono.

54:08.000 --> 54:16.000
OK, I was going to say and I can't. Al Franken. Well, until what happened is that he was completely terrible to women.

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
But we need to just throw out the scope of terrible the women thing, though.

54:21.000 --> 54:27.000
I mean, it's definitely. Well, whatever. There's a whole nother layer of the onion.

54:27.000 --> 54:34.000
I don't think we should be peeling back right now. But the the the big thing is that fuck this drain the swamp bullshit.

54:34.000 --> 54:40.000
The swamp is in Washington. You need to throw out the garbage. He was just repeating stuff that he thought people would like to see.

54:40.000 --> 54:48.000
Throw out the fucking garbage. Anyway, I totally appreciate that. J.D. in chat says, Rob, run in your local district.

54:48.000 --> 54:54.000
I heart that you think that. And believe me, I've given it thought because and I've told the story on OLR before.

54:54.000 --> 55:03.000
But if you are not aware, my ex before I was with Alan, who if you go way, way, way back on this show, you can probably hear on this show at some point.

55:03.000 --> 55:11.000
What you may not have known at the time is that my ex was a candidate for state assembly here in California and he damn near won.

55:11.000 --> 55:16.000
And we should all be thankful he didn't. In retrospect, I'm going to see this now.

55:16.000 --> 55:23.000
He didn't strike me as very smart. But the one thing I learned from that experience, I'm not going to sit here to shade my ex to know.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
I'll shade him. We go for it. But the one thing not very smart.

55:26.000 --> 55:41.000
The one thing I learned from that whole experience, you guys, if this guy can run for office and get more votes than anyone in his party had ever gotten in that district, if that guy can run for office, any fucking idiot can run for office.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Just look at the president.

55:43.000 --> 55:53.000
Three words that you wouldn't think go together. All two of them could go together. Gay, Asian, Republican.

55:53.000 --> 56:01.000
I didn't want to talk about it. All right. Anyway, what else do I want to say about that whole thing? Before, not the ex.

56:01.000 --> 56:08.000
Oh, me running for office and why that won't happen. Because, unfortunately, there is too much of my life that's been recorded.

56:08.000 --> 56:15.000
Somebody will go back to early episodes of Orange Lounge Radio where we said stupid things because we weren't educated better.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
Well, that's why we just have to erase it from the internet.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
Somebody just put you doing Rocky.

56:22.000 --> 56:31.000
Yeah, they'll take shit out of context. But the thing is, also with Rocky, I'm not embarrassed about any of that. Rocky gave an outlet to a lot of people, you know?

56:31.000 --> 56:37.000
Yeah, but I mean, I'm just saying that it would be something that someone would try to use against you.

56:37.000 --> 56:45.000
Somebody will find an early, early, early episode of this show or under station live or something where maybe I said the R word or I said granny chaser, but with a different word.

56:45.000 --> 56:52.000
And now I know that that is not okay. Like, you know, I've been educated and that was a long time ago.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
But that's the disgustingness of politics is that people will dig up old shit.

56:56.000 --> 57:06.000
This is the reason why I like the activism that I do. Because the activism that I do, I can be as loud and fucking obnoxious as I need to be.

57:06.000 --> 57:15.000
Although I try not to be loud and fucking obnoxious. I try to do things the right way. Activism is just as big a part as running for office.

57:15.000 --> 57:20.000
Because you need to get out there and make your voice be heard by the masses.

57:20.000 --> 57:28.000
And I don't care if people don't like, oh, this is not gaming. This is political. This all affects your life.

57:29.000 --> 57:38.000
And as we can see now, it's going to affect your ability to game, you know, as what we see, you know, potentially happening with this whole net neutrality thing.

57:38.000 --> 57:48.000
It's going to be a thing. You've got to, I hate the term woke, but you've got to wake yourself up. You have to go out and be a part of life.

57:48.000 --> 57:52.000
I do love these comments in chat. There's a great discussion going on in chat.

57:52.000 --> 57:59.000
J.D. says millennials will vote for a Rocky Horror person. That honestly is probably true. You know, that part honestly probably couldn't be held against me as much.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
I would vote as long as you went into office in a corset.

58:02.000 --> 58:13.000
Only with the theme playing. And let's see, Bobby Blackwell points out there was a guy running for office in Florida that got destroyed by the opposition because of the in-character post he made when he was in a vampire LARP.

58:13.000 --> 58:23.000
But see, I would look at somebody like that and go like, that person gets me in a way that, you know, curmudgeon-y frumple bump that's running against them doesn't.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
I'm going to officially change my name to that.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I just found Loki's drag name.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
It fits.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
Rob's red now.

58:38.000 --> 58:45.000
I just pulled that name out of thin air, but it works. It's a perfect drag name for Loki. Curmudgeon-y frumple bump. Is that what I said?

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
Curmudgeon-y frumple bump.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
Anyway.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
Rob.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I can't. I can't. Alright.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Rob had to lean against the wall.

58:56.000 --> 59:05.000
I do want to say a Zets comment because it's really good. The thing is you have to own it. Hiding your skeletons is what gets you into trouble. Absolutely. Absolutely.

59:05.000 --> 59:16.000
And that's why I say right here, maybe I will run for office someday. If somebody tries to use that old shit against me, I learn every day and I learn to do better every day.

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
And so, yes, you will find stupid shit I said, but it was in 2004.

59:20.000 --> 59:25.000
Raginator said Rob Robert's campaign slogan, in just seven days he'll make your district respectable.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
I like that.

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
Wait, hold on. Hold on, you guys. Did Raginator actually say something funny?

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
Yes.

59:35.000 --> 59:40.000
Could we get that in the OLR Wiki, please? It was Sunday, April 8th at 7.05 Pacific.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Get to it, dark, dark.

59:42.000 --> 59:48.000
It was Sunday, April 8th. Raginator said something funny. Actually funny. Give him a round of applause, everybody.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
I'm such an asshole.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
S2100mattinchat says Rob owns all his skeletons.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
But Rob, are you a bleached asshole?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Stop it.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000
S2100mattinchat says Rob owns his skeletons all the time. He says Super Metroid is the best game of all time over Chrono Trigger.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
You're right, I own it. I said what I said.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Everyone can be wrong.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
All right, anyway, let's move on.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Or as the phrase goes, even the clock is correct twice a day.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Loki, get us to another story.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Comradesome Frumblebump, get us to another story.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
All right, sounds good.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
So let's talk a little bit about PUBG.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:37.000
So PUBG and, of course, the company that makes it are going after some of these clones that are online.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.000
So one of these, I guess, PUBG Corp is citing, I guess, NetEase because they're using...

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.000
It's not even necessarily that they're outright copying PUBG, like putting it up there, you know, just changing the name or something like that.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000
But basically because they use the word chicken dinner in their marketing and they have their similarities in...

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Are they gonna sue KFC?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And they have similarities in... They have buildings and landscapes and vehicles and weapons and clothes and stuff like that.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And then also they were going after another company because they used a frying pan as a weapon in there.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Dude.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Wasn't a frying pan a weapon in Final Fantasy IV?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Well, a frying pan was a weapon in Left 4 Dead 2. I think one of the Silent Hill games had a frying pan as a weapon.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Frying pans have a history of being used as weapons.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Exactly. And should we go back to like...

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Dragonlance books.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Like movies and stuff like that have used frying pans as weapons.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000
So basically, I remember PUBG Corp was also one to like,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Why don't we share that Fortnite's doing better than our game?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
They're copiers.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Okay, Waluigi.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Seriously, they just bitch in moments.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.000
It seems like they don't have much of an argument.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000
They need to get out of the mindset of a patent troll.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
They need to get out of the patent troll mindset.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Well, you can't trademark aspects of a game like this.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
You can't trademark frying pan.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
You can't trademark a frying pan because a frying pan is a fucking frying pan.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Our chat room is lighting up.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
JD says Princess Peach uses a frying pan as a weapon.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Sia Tabiri asks, are they going to sue Trixie Mattel?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Winner, winner. Chicken dinner.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
That phrase has been around for fucking ever.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I know it certainly is in Fortnite.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I remember reading the Dragonlance books ages ago,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
and one of the characters, her primary weapons were a pot lid and a frying pan.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, why not a steak dinner?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Steak dinner is better than chicken dinner.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I actually agree with Tigerclaw a lot on this.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Steak dinner is better than a chicken dinner.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Winner, winner. Ruth Chris gift card.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
That's the game I play.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
That doesn't rhyme.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Brad from Pop Culture says they're going to sue Cooking Mama.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
You guys are on fire with the jokes tonight. What's up with this?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
We've got some sassy bitches in the chat.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Y'all drank a load of sass before tonight's show.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
You should think of new catchphrases they could use

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
in place of winner, winner, chicken dinner.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Oh, maybe that should be a list list.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Oh, here I know. We could just say, I want my baby back, Rizzer.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Or, I feel like chicken tonight, or I don't know.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Loser, loser.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Loser, loser. You starve.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
It was shake and bake, and I helped.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
It's stupid. It's dumb.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
It screams of desperation because, I don't know,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
because they're blaming everybody but themselves for the game,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
not doing as well as their competition.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Honestly, their competition, they took the formula that they have,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
which is almost like a genre now,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
and just kind of made it different and better.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Sorry, you can cry about it all you want,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
but I don't think you have really the leg to stand on,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
the legal leg to stand on for suing these people,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
or trying to file a lawsuit against them.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Sorry.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Good luck with that.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I'm laughing because the chat room, Sia Tabiri goes,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
where's the beef?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:25.000
It's my favorite one so far for a replacement wine.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Pardon me, do you have any grape upon?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Jesus, you guys are on fire tonight.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
SSG100Matt says, you know what?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Competition keeps people from resting on their laurels.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
They should embrace it and keep one-upping each other with innovation.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
This.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Exactly.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
They put out some more maps for the game

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
that just haven't really been released everywhere yet,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000
so I know they've got some new maps that are supposed to get things more interesting,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
but yeah, you can't just, don't be like king, okay?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Don't be like king and start suing people for using the word candy or saga.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
It's ridiculous.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I can't believe nobody for a jingle for winning one of these one versus 100 games

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
has said, a Mr. Bucket, a Mr. Bucket.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
All right, anyway.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Let's move on to another story that talks about,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
can you play PUBG on Linux?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Does that game exist on Linux?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
What about Fortnite?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Are these games on Linux?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I don't know because maybe.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I mean, they have the mobile versions run on Android and stuff,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
so maybe they have a Linux version.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
From Ragenator, Wiener Wiener, Oscar Mayer dinner.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
That's pretty good.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
That's pretty good.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Anyway, so here's the thing.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I want to talk a little bit about steam machines

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
because if you weren't aware, steam machines kind of came and went.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Like, well, they're not gone, but.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
But they weren't popular?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Yeah, they just, they didn't really get adopted,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
and this was noted that, oh, Valve is no longer highlighting these steam machine hardwares

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
on the front page of the Steam store,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
and this is saying, oh, this is the end.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
They're gone.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Although, Valve employee Pierre Lou Griffiths,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
because nobody has a title there,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
so I'm sorry if I butchered this guy's name,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
but he said in a post to a steam community that the steam machine link

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
on the Steam store front page was removed based on user traffic.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
He did acknowledge, steam machines aren't exactly flying off the shelves,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
but our reasons for striving towards a competitive and open gaming platform

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
haven't significantly changed.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Valve learned quite a bit about the state of the Linux ecosystem

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
for real world game developers out there.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
We've taken a lot of feedback and have been heads down

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
on addressing the shortcomings we've observed,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
and also went on to highlight that Valve is continuing to work

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
on the Vulkan graphics standard.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
That does support Mac and Linux,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
and that's all in part to the company's effort.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
We have other Linux initiatives in the pipe

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
that we're not quite ready to talk about.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
SteamOS will continue to be our medium to deliver these improvements to our customers,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
and we think they will ultimately benefit the Linux ecosystem at large.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
When are they going to put out a new source engine?

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
When are they going to put out a game?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Anything.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Anything.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
What was the last game?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Dota 2.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Actually, probably VR games.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Now I think HTC Vive.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Didn't they have a card game or something?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Dota had a card game, yes.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Yeah, the Dota card game.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
But I think to be fair, some of the HTC Vive experiences

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
were where some of the resources was going lately.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.000
So I just, like many of you, would just like to see Valve do literally anything.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I just miss the old Valve, where they put out games.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Yes.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Semi-regularly.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Bobby Blackwell, I knew he would be on top of his VR stuff.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Bobby Blackwell says the Lab was the last Valve game.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
That was more of a minigame.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Maybe a couple years ago.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
In gaming terms, it was ages ago, yes.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000
So, Steam Machines didn't quite take off.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Does this surprise you guys, or no?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Why?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
No, it doesn't surprise me, because small form factor PCs,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000
they're just hard to, it's hard to make a really small form factor.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
And honestly, I think if you're going to game on a TV or something like that,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
it doesn't have to be that small of a case, just make it look nice.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I mean, that's really it.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
They have cases that are fucking huge, but it's all about thermals and shit.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
And also something like that, you want to be able to make sure that it's upgradeable,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
because it is a PC after all.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
It was hard, I think what it was is they were trying to compete with consoles.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And the cost of consoles is so low now, it's hard to make a PC that, you know,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
is going to be competitive price-wise.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
DarkSagro, do you have an opinion on the Steam Boxes or Steam Machines

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
and why they didn't do so well?

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Not really.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I mean, people, if they want a console, they'll get a console.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
You know, I just...

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at with this too.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I don't think Valve ever really said, not that it's said,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
but I don't think Valve found the audience for this.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Like, Valve never really figured out who's the audience for these boxes,

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
because I feel like most people that want to do PC gaming have a PC.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Most people that want to play on their TV have a console.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
So where does this fit in? Is it supposed to compete with consoles?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Well, I would assume Microsoft and a lot of stuff that they're doing

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
kind of cock-blocked them in that regard,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
because Microsoft's kind of been pushing with their console and the PC space

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
and trying to unify that, and I think this is a case where maybe

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Microsoft kind of has pulled that off a little better than Steam.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I was only using my Steam Link.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Yeah, I have a Steam Link and I haven't used it yet.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I mean, we used our old one once and then returned it,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
and I actually needed to ask you how you had your setup

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
that you don't get any latency, so...

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Because it's wired. I use that gigantic wire and I plug it into the Steam Link.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
That's how I don't get latency.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Okay.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Yep.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, battery.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Bobby Blackwell says,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Steam Link is better for playing PC games on a TV

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
than getting a Steam machine, or rather, cheaper.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And yeah, they are, man, I paid like 50 bucks for one,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
and Fantaz says, I bought a Steam Link for four bucks on Black Friday.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Got it for a dollar.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Yeah, that's how I got mine.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
A lot of them, they're giving them away with different game purchases,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
so keep an eye out for those wonderful sales.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Man, that makes me mad. Alright, let's move on.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Another subject, Dark Sakura.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Well, there are games that are now, again, banned in China,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
but they're taking it a step further.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:27.000
So basically, what happened is that there was a scene in,

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I think it was Call of Duty Black Ops 2,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
where you could drop a bomb in Tiananmen Square,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
and so the Chinese government pretty much, you know,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.000
did this big crackdown so that they would, I guess, ban the game again,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
but they're also now putting in surveillance in Internet cafes

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
to keep people from buying them and from playing the games.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
They're actually trying to stop all playing of banned games.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Some of the other ones were Red Alert 2,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Glory of the Republic, where you could fight against the People's Liberation Army.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
There's just a big list of games, but there's more than 5,000 Internet cafes

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
now have to have a government surveillance system on all the computers.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000
So one of the players is saying is that every time they play,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
there's this message that pops up to warn them

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
and that it's really just removed a lot of the fun from playing, of course.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000
But anyway, the way it's going to work is that any official will be notified

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
if users are playing banned games in the cafes.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
I guess there could always be worse laws than leaving net neutrality behind,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000
but I'm kind of not surprised to hear that particular topic,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000
the Tiananmen Square thing, is a very sensitive thing to the Chinese government

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.000
for obvious reasons, things that they're not exactly wanting their people to really know about.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
We're heading that way, though.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Well, we need to embrace and remember that in this country.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000
We're able to share these types of things openly, at least the way things are now.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
I don't really think some of those fundamental American things are really ever going to go away,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
but that we're able to have that freedom of speech to be able to talk about it.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
To have this fucking show, honestly, and say whatever we want,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
we have to be thankful that we have that ability because not everybody in the world does.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:30.000
As pissed off as we get sometimes, the way things are, there are some pretty rad things about being an American.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
And the right to get pissed off about it is one of them.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Anyway, let's move on. Loki, just a couple more stories before we get to the Classic Game of the Week.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:45.000
This is kind of cool news. There was an announcement about Jackbox Party Pack 5,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
and one of the games that's going to be among that is You Don't Know Jack.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:56.000
They have this fictional company, I guess, that's kind of like the overlay for the whole thing,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000
this binge pipe or something like that, and it's this kind of...

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Buzzfeed type of thing.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Yeah, a parody of all the streaming services out there and content and social media and stuff like that.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
So it's interesting. I don't know what other games are supposed to be in there as well.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
They haven't announced those yet. They'll trickle that out over the coming months.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
But that sounds cool that there's going to be a whole new You Don't Know Jack games.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Yeah, I forgot to mention in my gaming league. That was the game I was trying to think of that I forgot.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:32.000
But on Friday, I actually did a Jackbox stream. I guessed it on CI Live's Con Improv, which our old friend of the show,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
he used to go by DMN. He doesn't go by that anymore, but that's what he was back in the day.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.000
But Jon works a lot with this group, the Con Improv group, and so they had me on their stream on Friday night doing

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Sorry, not You Don't Know Jack, but the Jackbox Party Pack.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000
And that was fun because somehow some of those games I just had never gotten around to playing.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Although I have all the Jackbox Party Packs, I guess I just never really had the people to play some of them.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
So we played that bracketeering, and we actually had 16 people in the game, and that was a lot of fun.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And I actually won one of them.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
The bracket was, because it just keeps going like these against these against these.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
You just keep kind of voting on answers.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:14.000
And the bracket was Best Name for a CPR Dummy, and I said Dummy McDummy Face, and I won.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
So there you go. But anyway.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
So yeah, the Jackbox games are fun.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000
And they've always been, they've come on the show a couple times here at ORR.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I think we know people over there that actually listen to the show.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000
So hi guys, and good luck with You Don't Know Jack and Jackbox Party Pack 5.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
I'm sure tons of people are gonna buy it because these games are great party games.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
They're great, like, you know, let's come together and do this.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000
One thing I do want to call out though, you know, in the interest of fairness, even though I'm big fans of Jackbox.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.000
They have made this whole, like, You Don't Know Jack is going to use mobile phones.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
And they've really stood by that.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Because one place where the last version of You Don't Know Jack, I think in the first Party Pack, if I remember right, first or second, I think the first one.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Where that one got a little bit of, you know, kind of criticism was that because people were using their phones to buzz in,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
it wasn't exactly accurate.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And you couldn't really use a controller, like you couldn't plug in a bunch of controllers and have people buzz in on the controller.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Like when You Don't Know Jack was, you know, on the PC and stuff where you had something more tangible and wired to buzz in on.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000
And so I thought it was interesting in some of the, you know, FAQs on this.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000
They basically said, yeah, we've heard that feedback and we're basically not going to implement it.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:34.000
But to be fair to them, they have said that they are building this one with the mobile phone stuff in mind.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
So this is being built for the mobile phones.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:44.000
So I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt because, you know, especially I kind of thought we weren't going to see You Don't Know Jack again.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Because I kind of thought Trivia Murder Party was their new, like, You Don't Know Jack.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And that game does work very well.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
It is pretty awesome.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
And that game was built for mobile phones from the ground up.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000
So with that in mind, knowing that Trivia Murder Party worked out really well.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.000
That's why I'm kind of having an open mind with letting them do You Don't Know Jack again even though they're not going to go back to a tangible controller for it.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
So we'll see what happens. I'm very curious.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
So let's see.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Bobby said, oh, it was in the VOG Network review because he wrote it because he didn't have them on his show.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:25.000
And said, you need a controller support, but then agrees that my friends only want to play Trivia Murder Party.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Well, too bad they couldn't, like, come up with a better way to, like, basically capture when someone buzzes in, like, you know, grabbing.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:39.000
I know it's hard to grab server time sometimes, but maybe just grabbing the server time every so often and then calculating it also with your phone time.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Right.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000
So you kind of get a timestamp and then that way any latency that's in there, just reading timestamps.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:53.000
So that way you shouldn't latency shouldn't be a problem. It's just me taking a sec for it to clue that you're, you know, say that you buzzed in.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I honestly wonder if in the new You Don't Know Jack game, they're just going to get rid of buzzing in because that's what they did in Trivia Murder Party.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
You don't buzz in. Everybody answers the question.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And those who get it wrong basically, you know, go to the death game or whatever, that whole thing.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Right.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:16.000
So, I mean, what if that's their solution is that the new You Don't Know Jack game, they're just going to get rid of buzzing in.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000
It'll be interesting, but again, because I like Trivia Murder Party so much and the other Jackbox games, too.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I know I keep talking about that one, but that one's the most adjacent to You Don't Know Jack and what it does.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
I think the new You Don't Know Jack will turn out just fine.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
So we'll see.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Good luck to those guys.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Look forward to it.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000
And hey, if you want to come on to OLR and talk about it, maybe drop an exclusive or two.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Love to have you.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
All right, one more story before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
And this has to do with, this is really cool.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Actually, this is a classic all in its own.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
And a lot of the games that will be included in this could very well be classic games of the week.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:57.000
SNK has revealed at PAX East in a panel that they are releasing a 40th anniversary collection for the Nintendo Switch.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
And this is going to include games that are upscaled to 1080p.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Now, even though this is SNK, this is not Neo Geo stuff.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
This is stuff that they made before Neo Geo was a thing.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
So this compilation includes games that will be released on the Nintendo Switch in Fall 2018.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
It includes things like Athena, both arcade and home versions.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Alpha Mission, home and arcade versions.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Akari Warriors.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Fuck yes.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Akari Warriors 3.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
What was the name of the second Akari Warriors game?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
It's in there too.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Gorilla War, P.O.W., Psycho Soldier, Street Smart, T.N.K.3, Vanguard.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Oh, Victory Road. That was Akari Warriors 2.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Psycho Soldier and, last but not least, Crystallis.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Which is an amazing NES RPG.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I can't believe there was never a second one.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Or was there? Am I missing something in our soccer?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Did they try to do like a second Crystallis on Neo Geo or something?

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I don't remember.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
I don't think they did. I think Crystallis...

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I know there was a Game Boy release at some point, but that was just the original game.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
So I think, yeah, they just didn't ever visit that series again.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Oh yeah, Crystallis was remade for Game Boy Color with a bonus boss. That was it.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I do remember that.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Anyway, with this collection, there will be a limited edition version of this with a book and a soundtrack CD.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
So that's all coming out Fall 2018.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
That's awesome. I'm definitely going to pick that up.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Shit, for Crystallis alone, probably.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
But all those other games are really good too.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I actually, I remember playing Athena on the NES and I didn't hate it as much as everyone else did.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Although it was a little bit wonky.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
But Ikaria Warriors, all those games are great.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
This does beg the question though.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Why wouldn't they just release these on Virtual Console?

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Now, yes, I know, LOL, Nintendo Virtual Console.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
But surely, they would have just kept these in the hopper to release.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Like Crystallis, they would have just released on Virtual Console at some point, right?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Or what's going on there?

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
We won't know until September.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I suppose.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
If it ends up being September.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I did notice though, like I bought, because I mentioned one of my friends, their daughter had a birthday.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
So I don't know how to shop for girls.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
So I know they had a Nintendo Switch, so I bought her a Switch game.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Bought her Scribblenauts, the new one.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I don't remember what it is.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Some party game, Scribblenauts party game.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Anyways, but it did mention something on the back.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
That there may be a fee for online service or something like that.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
So they have that already in play.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
That they're going to charge something for it later on.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Just when that later on is going to be.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Alright, well, maybe finally we'll have some Virtual Console answers at E3 this year.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
But I'm really at the point where I'm like, I'm just not going to hold my breath anymore.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
It'll happen when it happens.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Maybe never.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
It's disappointing. I think it's money left on the table for them.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I do too, but it's their choice.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Because they seem to be making a lot of money anyway.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Anyway, let's take a trip down memory lane.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Every week Dark Sakura opens the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Hey, you brats, you should be paying attention to this.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000
But, in a twist for the year 2018, once a month she says,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Hey, why don't you use this peripheral to play a game?

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
It's Dark Sakura's classic peripheral of the month.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Or, what?

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Say it with me. Peripheral.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Peripheral. I just...

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
It's your piscetti.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
You learn to say things one way and it's tomato, tomato, it's ingrained in your brain.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Anyway, or as my dad always said, ammons.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000
And that's the one that messes with me.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Ew.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Yeah, I know, right? Anyway.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
But in this case it's peripherals of the month.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Yes, well, because they're technically the same thing.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Alright, so here it is.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
For the same reason.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
What did you pick, Dark Sakura?

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I picked the twin sticks.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Specifically starting with the Saturn twin stick and then the Dreamcast twin stick.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Which were both released simply for one game each.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:56.000
The Saturn twin stick was a peripheral designed to be used on Cybertroopers Virtual On.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:03.000
So it is two joysticks that have fewer buttons but each of them have a button on top.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:11.000
And it's set up, at least the Saturn twin stick is meant to look like the same style as a Virtual On panel.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000
It was only sold with the pack that contained Virtual On.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Although the twin sticks did have it's own product code.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:29.000
It was released only in Japan even though there was an English and European manual.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000
And it led to then the creation of the Dreamcast twin stick.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
In Japan it was released on November 29th, 1996.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:45.000
And retailed for 5,800 yen, so roughly 50 something bucks.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I sadly do not have a whole lot about the specifics of this.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000
But I can tell you that they're fucking fun to play with.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Now this goes on, I'm actually to this day still wanting a pair of Saturn twin sticks.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000
But now I'll go to something that I do own, the Dreamcast twin stick.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Which was released to be used with Cybertroopers Virtual On or Atario Tangrum.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:17.000
And it is exactly just like the Saturn twin stick except it's that plain grey and white Dreamcast with orange buttons on it.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
It does have a VMU slot and it only released in Japan.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
It's release date was December 9th, 1999.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:32.000
And it also, even though it came out years later, it also retailed for the same price, 5,800 yen.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
You can play Virtual On with a controller.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:46.000
But there's just something different about playing it with the twin sticks that make the game so much more immersive and so much more fun to play.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And we had a lot of time spent on Atario Tangrum.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Rob, do you remember Game Masters that used to be on Greenback?

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
That's where we got our twin sticks from.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Oh, funny.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
That's where we got our Japanese Dreamcast.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.000
So, we just had so much fun with Virtual On and I love fucking Virtual On.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Which I've done for Classic Game before.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
You can't mention Virtual On without eventually bringing up the twin sticks.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000
So, I've never played on any game other than Virtual On.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
So, I do not know if it's compatible.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
But, hey, it's fucking fun and it's my peripheral of the week.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Alright, there you go.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
The twin sticks.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Twins, because there's two of them.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And plus, that music in the background is the best music in Virtual On.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
It was really just an excuse for you to play Virtual On music here on the show, wasn't it?

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Kind of, sort of.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
That's alright, I totally support that.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Anyway, we are going to take a quick break.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Including your calls, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
All one word on Skype if you want to give us a call a little later.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And we're going to get as well some rapid fire news and some more stories.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Sadly, no mailbag tonight it looks like though.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
At least when I looked before the show there wasn't anything there.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
So, I don't know.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I haven't checked yet.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Yeah, but just don't forget to send us emails in the future.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
So, we've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come when we come back.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.000
We're back live tonight with episode number 725 of our show, already in progress.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.000
And thank you guys, of course, as always for tuning in and spending your Sunday nights with us.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Or, whatever time throughout the week you're setting aside to listen to this podcast.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
We do really appreciate it, of course.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Before we get into some rapid fire news tonight, I have some late breaking news.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:43.000
And, unfortunately, this is another one of those, like, Lord Face Palm type of stories.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Overwatch League just suspended another player.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:53.000
This time the Boston Uprising has suspended Dream Casper, was the name of the guy, following.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:02.000
He's 21 and this follows allegations he pursued a romantic and potentially sexual relationship with someone believed to be a 14 or 15 year old girl.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
In a tweet, the Boston Uprising said,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:13.000
We take all allegations of this nature very seriously and as a result, Dream Casper has been suspended from the Boston Uprising indefinitely.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.000
The Overwatch League also putting out a tweet that they are aware of the situation as well.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Dream Casper, one of the best Western DPS players in the league, who was unknown prior to the league debut and will no doubt slip right back into obscurity after this.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:34.000
That, by the way, for those keeping score at home, is the sixth player suspended by the Overwatch League for some sort of shitty behavior since it's begun.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Look, I've talked a lot at length about the Overwatch League here on the program.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I like that at least little baby steps, you know, they finally got a woman on the league, which is one.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
We got a token, but we can do a little bit better in that regard.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:55.000
And I think, you know, as we're starting to see the Overwatch League really kind of push esports to the next level.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Like, you know, ESPN ran this story I just read to you guys.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
So, you know, esports is becoming more and more mainstream.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:07.000
I just, I have a feeling, you know, I'm not going to try to blame Overwatch League for the shitty behavior.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:13.000
You know, shitty people are going to do shitty things and I'm not sure Overwatch League, I'm not sure what they could have done to prevent it.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000
It's just, you know, their response is swift and mighty and that's what they have to do.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:24.000
But my whole thing is just like, we're going to really see, you know, as the spotlight gets put on some of these people,

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000
we're going to really see some behaviors just kind of like, you know, I guess it's like Jamie has said before, taking out the trash.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000
And unfortunately Overwatch League's had a little bit of it.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:43.000
But hopefully they will, hopefully they will just do better in some of their recruitment so far for Season 2.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Alan Alchemy in chat, in all caps, mind you, says,

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:55.000
These dudes get paid thousands between Patreons, Twitch partnerships, and gaming equipment sponsorships to play video games.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Literally all that is asked of them is to not be racist, homophobic, or date rape, and they can't do it.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.000
JD in chat says, Here's the thing, a lot of professional athletes have a problem being decent people.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Whatever, congratulations gaming, you've arrived. Your athletes are just as overpaid to be awful people as mainstream culture.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Azet in chat says, But I'm famous and popular and can do anything. What are consequences?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:29.000
So that's why I said, you know, I will give Overwatch League credit for bringing down the Swift hammer of justice swiftly.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Anyhow, let's move on to something a little more positive and some rapid fire news and some things to look forward to in gaming. Loki.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Alright, so Chrono Trigger, we talked about the PC port, that was kind of meh, not great.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:55.000
People didn't like what they kind of did to the graphics of the game. However, with that, they've been, apparently Square Enix has been working to address issues.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:01.000
And one of the patches that they will be releasing will be a patch that includes the original graphics for the game.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:09.000
So at least that's something. No word on when that is exactly going to, you know, make it there.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
So you can turn the filter on and off.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Yes.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Or what they're doing is they're quickly making another, but they're not going to tell you it's another filter, it's just the regular graphics.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Probably.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Yeah. Anyway.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:28.000
So. And then this was something that I saw kind of in my feeds because I do follow Angry Joe a bit.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:40.000
But if you're not aware, he worked on this along with some other people to do a Street Fighter tabletop strategy game, it looks like.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And so basically it's got a miniatures game, I guess would be the best way to describe it.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.000
So it's a Street Fighter miniatures game and the miniatures look pretty fucking awesome.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
It was on Kickstarter, got funded in a day.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000
But if you are interested in it, you can check it out on Kickstarter.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
So just look for Street Fighter, the miniatures game.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
And yeah, it's pretty awesome looking.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I mean, just these would totally be awesome amiibos.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I mean, I don't know.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I'm not really interested in a ton of miniatures games.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
It's been a while since I was in the miniatures scene, but it looks cool.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Fantasmchat says Angry Joe was at PAX, which doesn't surprise me.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
PAX is a pretty strong board game community.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Didn't they do the PAX Unplugged? Didn't that happen this year in Pennsylvania somewhere?

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000
I don't remember.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Philly or something. Anyway.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:32.000
I remember being a kid though and having like the Street Fighter RPG game that I think was done by White Wolf.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Yes, funny enough, Bobby Black Wolf. I was just about to read that. You're right.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000
There was a pen and paper Street Fighter game in the 90s.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
It was by the same people who made Vampire, Werewolf, and Mage games.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
I interviewed the dude who designed it, so you can see that on a previous episode.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000
I didn't even look in the chat, but I had it.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Yeah, I remember that too actually.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Some of the cool stuff they have in there.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
So they have like destructible environment pieces and stuff.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.000
And each of the play mats or whatever you can do like different stages from the games.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000
So they have like Guile's stage and I know they have like the dojo and stuff.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Hopefully you can play music.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
But can you say, oh my car?

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I don't know.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.000
But yeah, with the game I know that they have like six core miniatures that come with it.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.000
So Ryuken, Chun-Li, Zangief, Vega, and Sagat.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
And then they're going to have an expansion with Bison and Akuma.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:31.000
And then I know some of the stretch goals were different characters from other games.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000
So like the Alpha series and that kind of stuff.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
So yeah, I mean, it looks cool.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
It looks pretty high quality. Hope it works out and gets released.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000
So Kickstarter is always very wary.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
I understand.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Alright, well let's talk about original Xbox.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Not the 360, not the Xbox One, but I mean like the Xbox First.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Direct Xbox, going way back.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Some news for the original Xbox.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Targeted to come out April 10th at 3.30 Pacific, 6.30 Eastern.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
So maybe by the time some of you have heard this.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
And it's going to be a backwards compatibility for these games on the Xbox One.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Now there already has been a little bit.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:18.000
But we're going to hear about the next wave of this on the next Inside Xbox.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Because right now there's only 13 games that are supported by the service.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
So Microsoft said in a recent Xbox news post,

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
one of our most common requests is for original Xbox backward compatibility news.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000
And we'll be starting off the show with a big update on just that.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
What? People want backwards compatibility?

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
That's totally news to Sony.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Make sure more people watch that than have watched anything before.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Because that's apparently the only way that Sony is going to get some of the information.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I've lost hope in Sony, let's be honest.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Yeah. Anyway, shoot, this next website is not loading for me.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
I don't know if this is something that you can pull up.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Oh my god, the backwards compatibility is not working on the website.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000
I know. Gosh. But anyway, I do remember it was something to do with the SNK heroines.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.000
The tag team frenzy is coming out on the Switch on September 7th in North America and Europe.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.000
And I thought this was cool. They're adding Shermie as a character in the game.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
And it made me think of Dark Sakura's former kitty.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Is that where the name came from?

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
That is indeed where my cat's name came from.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
When I saw that I instantly thought of you.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
It did work on mine because my PC is beyond Windows XP.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
It's not on Windows XP.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:31.000
It is coming out digitally on PlayStation 4 September 7th in Europe as well.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
In North America and Europe.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
And they're going to have Shermie as a playable character.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
And she debuted in Kingdom Fighters 97.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
And it looks neat.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Alright, thank you for the pinch hitting there with the correction on the platforms it's coming out for.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Well, Konami has purchased a domain name recently for Goemon.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
So Goemon.com has been purchased.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.000
They haven't done anything with it yet.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:08.000
But maybe there will be a new Goemon game on Switch? Maybe? We'll see.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Well, the Bomberman revitalization did very well for them.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:19.000
So, you know, Goemon. I don't think it's a game people know as well here on this side of the ocean.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I don't know. I used to play tons of Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Yeah, Legend of the Mystical Ninja was badass though.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
That's one of those, like, if you haven't played this Super Nintendo game, you should check that one out.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Because it used a lot of the Mode 7 tricks and some of the retro shit.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Like, you can play the first stage of Gradius in that game. Which is cool.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:47.000
And then in other news, there have been some other speedruns announced for Summer Games Done Quick 2018.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Including Cuphead, Metroid Samus Returns, Super Mario Odyssey.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
And it's going to be happening on June 24th through July 1st.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000
And hopefully, well, I'll get a chance to watch it.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:08.000
One of them actually I'm interested in is a Final Fantasy 6 speedrun that's glitchless.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Yeah, it was all espers too. That looked cool.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Ooh, that would be cool.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I was going to say, the first thing I did when I heard that they announced their lineup, immediately looked for P.T.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Very disappointing.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
To see if it was there and why is the clock over there.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Because they'd have to know the triggers.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
I know, I know.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000
But other games listed are A Hat in Time, Celeste, which I almost picked up.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Divinity Original Sin 2, Eichen Class, and a good bunch of others.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Though, I don't know, they always need to end with Super Metroid and last year's didn't.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Are they going to end with it this year?

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000
I don't think so.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Wow.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:53.000
But they also have a good backup list, I guess, for if they get extra time or make tiers or whatnot.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.000
I always like races. Whenever they do races, it's awesome.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Yeah, the Super Metroid race was really fun.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Yeah.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Like two people just like died right away.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000
How about a P.T. race? I'd be in for that.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Alright.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
You'd have to know your triggers.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Or the swordless, I like the swordless randomized items, Legends, all the...

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Those are fun.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Those are great, yeah.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out what speed games might be ran this week.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000
New in retail and digitally.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000
There's actually some things coming out this week, so that's kind of nice.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
We have a game called Dark Rose Valkyrie on PC.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000
A game called Extinction on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Owlboy is making its console debut on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:48.000
A game called Project Nimbus Code Marae on PlayStation 4.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.000
We have a game called Regalia of Men and Monarchs, Rail Edition on PlayStation 4.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice on Xbox One.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Maelstrom on PC.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Robocraft Infinity on Xbox One.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Ys Origins on Xbox One.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Then we've got Death and Request on PlayStation 4.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Also coming out a little bit later in the week,

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Regalia of Men and Monarchs, Royal Edition on the Switch and Xbox One.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
And then, that's it.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Okay, let's travel over to Japan, where that same Death and Request game comes out in a regular and Death and box in Japan on April the 12th.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Cities Skylines gets its PlayStation 4 edition in Japan also on the 12th.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.000
And a new release of Darkest Dungeon with Chinese subs comes out for the greater Asian region also on April the 12th.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Checking the Vita, believe it or not, nothing this week, because the Vita is still supported in Japan.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
They have a release next week on the 19th, just not this week.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Then looking quickly at the Switch and the DS.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Looks like The Snack World trays Jarere's Gold.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000
I don't know if I'm saying that right, but that's a level 5 game.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
So, I mean, there's got to be something to that.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Maybe that's something that will come out over here eventually.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I don't know, but Snack World, maybe that's going to be their next Yokai watch, who knows.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:15.000
But that is going to be out on the Switch, so that will probably be a pretty big release being that that's a level 5 game.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000
3DS doesn't really have anything this week, so otherwise it is pretty quiet over in Japan.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
How about Europe, DarkSakura?

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:33.000
A few things. We have, let's see, on the 10th we have Extinction on PlayStation and Xbox, the new ones.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Darkest Dungeon Crimson Edition for Switch.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Steam World Dig 2 for Switch, that's on April 12th.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:46.000
On April 13th we have Rick and Morty Virtual Rick-ality, and that's it.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Alright.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.000
So, this, maybe because I was looking ahead in the month, in a couple weeks from now, of course, we have the Nintendo Labo stuff.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Let's see someone speedrun that, and that includes building the peripherals that they need to do the game.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.000
That would actually be a really funny speedrun to submit, a Nintendo Labo building.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
You have to build it and then play it.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
That sounds like something out of Odyssey of the Mind.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Nintendo Labo Robot Kit, I want to see the speedrun of that, including building the whole robot armor that you have to wear.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Alright, usually this part of the show we would do the mailbag.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
What mailbag?

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:25.000
The one that we have that's always open 24-7. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
But DarkSakura opened it, and there was nothing there.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
There were some moths.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
The moths ate all the mail.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
That's right, the moths ate all the mail, so there it is.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
And then the dust bunnies ate the moths.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Alright, we didn't have anything that we didn't read.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I thought we had something we didn't read on the other show.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I hope we didn't miss something.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
If we did, I'm sorry, re-forward it. We'll get to it next week.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
But participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
So then we'll get back into some news. Loki.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Alright, so apparently there's this study that is done with Take Two games.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Rockstar North, I should say.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:07.000
There's been quite a pay inequality issue with genders at the company.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:15.000
So they're saying that apparently women are paid 64% lower than men,

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:20.000
while the median is 34% lower.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:30.000
So they're saying that on average the female employee makes 0.36 euro for every 1 euro made by a man.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
So that's terrible.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Why is it so fucking hard to not pay women and men the same?

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Why is this so hard? Why is this a challenge?

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Now I realize that you said euros, so this is a problem that goes beyond.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000
We talk about it here in this country, but clearly this is a problem in a lot of other places too.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Yeah, it's worldwide. But what I want to know, and don't get me wrong,

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I think that there is a problem with pay scale and making sure everyone's paid fairly,

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:01.000
but we're talking female programmers and male programmers, same job?

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Or are we just talking overall in the company maybe women don't hold the same positions as men there?

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
And that could be a whole other issue altogether.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Exactly. My brain went there too.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Maybe they're averaging everything and you don't have as many women in leadership positions,

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
which, don't get me wrong, is a whole other problem.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000
But we need to get into, well, what is the root of this problem?

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Are these numbers because women are not in these higher positions?

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Yeah, and trust me, with Rockstar North, they make fucking Grand Theft Auto and shit.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.000
They should be paid handsomely. Everybody should be paid handsomely for that game.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says,

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000
People are told it's rude to discuss money so co-workers don't compare notes.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Also, there is a fear they will be resented if they make more,

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:49.000
when in reality the underpaid person is far more likely to resent their superior.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
And this, again, this is another country we're talking about.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
This isn't, but, I mean, not to, I'm not trying to deny it doesn't happen here,

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
because obviously it does, but I'm just saying this, again,

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000
is a problem in the industry, period.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Well, on top of that, too, I've seen it happen in many places of employment,

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000
but, you know, when you get a raise or when, you know, you get your hiring salary,

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
they tell you not to tell anybody.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
And I think that that lack of transparency for people,

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000
now, I understand in some cases you get, like, a higher merit.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
For example, if you have a higher level of education,

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:29.000
sometimes you'll get paid more than someone who may not have, like, say, gone to college.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
And it can also be your experience, too.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Like, if you're coming from a job, you know, that has a higher,

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
you already have a higher salary in one place, you know,

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000
you might get hired on for more of a salary than you would if you didn't have a job with a higher salary,

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000
if they're looking at salary history or something, or how well you negotiate for your pay.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
But there still should not be such a heavy disparity.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Right. Right.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
It's disgusting.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000
I wonder if, with the whole experience and everything,

01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:01.000
we're not paying now in this industry for a problem that's existed in the industry since the 80s and 90s,

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
where women were, like, straight up excluded from a lot of elements.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.000
I mean, granted, there was a lot of women that did very important things in this industry, right?

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Like, Roberta Williams is one of the first that comes to mind, like, one of the all-times greats.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.000
But anyway, my point is, is that clearly you didn't have as many women in the industry then,

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
so you don't have as many experienced people.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Now, again, I'm not saying that makes it right.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Please don't mishear me with this.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.000
But, you know, I just, I wonder if, you know, in trying to look for,

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000
how did we get here and how do we make it better, if maybe that's a cause,

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.000
is that we're paying for problems of 20 years ago, which just goes to show,

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
you can't expect the future to fix everything.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
You've got to fix things now because it's going to impact the future.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Yeah, and I can't imagine, like, even just in the gaming industry,

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000
I can't imagine, like, a position that would be better, a female or a male would be better at.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000
I mean, it's just, honestly, I don't even really think about that when it comes to, like,

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.000
games and programming and artists and stuff like that.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000
It's just, like, your talent is your talent regardless of what your gender is.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
It's just, I don't know.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.000
I don't know how this kind of problem still exists in the world these days.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:08.000
But one note they did mention, though, they said part of the reason that Rockstar North is such an outlier

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.000
is due to the lack of women in higher paying roles at the company.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:18.000
According to the database, only 8% of Rockstar North employees are in the top quartile of hourly pay at the company,

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:25.000
are women, and most of the women in the company work in lower roles at the lower end of the pay scale.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000
All right. Well, I don't know if this is a problem we can solve near an Orange Lounge radio.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
But, A, it shouldn't be this hard.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.000
B, you know, we have to put these issues out there and highlight them and point and say that is a problem

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
in order for something to get done about it.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Correct. And not to say that everybody should just jump ship from a company or something like that,

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.000
but, like, a lot of people, and it doesn't necessarily have to be with discrepancy in pay,

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:57.000
it could be just they don't like the, you know, not the ethics,

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:03.000
but, like, the environment of a big AAA publisher or they're looking to be creative on their own or something like that,

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000
and a lot of people are spinning off in their own indie studios and being successful,

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.000
so that might be an option as well. I mean, I don't know.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000
But, then again, it's Rockstar, and Rockstar's fucking Rockstar, so, you know.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Well, you know who has to be willing to bring up that there's an issue with how women get paid?

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Men.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Which is also stupid.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000
It just goes back...

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Would you say that's true, though, what I just said?

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Well, yes. I mean, they...

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:38.000
But the thing is that that goes back to remember that thing where the male co-worker and female co-worker traded their signatures,

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
and suddenly all the things that she had been complaining about he saw happening,

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000
and, like, oh, well, this is really happening, and no one believed it until a man said it,

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000
where we've been saying this shit for years.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
You should have fucking listened in the first place.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Stupid.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.000
All right, well, let's move on to a story to hopefully make us feel a little better,

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.000
because this story involves, you know what, throwing it up and going outside.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:08.000
It's a story about Pokemon Go, which, you know, all of us here at OLR play in some capacity,

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
some of us a little more than others.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:15.000
But, anyway, Pokemon Go trying to do some good things in the real world here with an Earth Day celebration.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.000
They're encouraging folks to actually help clean up the world on April 22nd, which is Earth Day.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Niantic is in a partnership with Mission Blue, PlayMob, and local nonprofits to encourage Pokemon Go players

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:31.000
to go to select places and pick up trash and clean up the environment.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:36.000
If so many players do this, and they are watching, like, how many people actually contribute to this,

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:43.000
then globally players will earn boosts to stardust when catching ground, water, and grass-type Pokemon,

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000
you know, earthy things, depending on how many registered players are in the area.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
You know, they did something like this in Ingress as well.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000
They did the Mission Days, and I can't remember, oh, God, they had a special name to them.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Maybe a Zet knows, because I don't remember what they were called.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
But Operation Clear Blue, that was it, right?

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:06.000
But Ingress did something similar where, you know, they encouraged these public service type of days, too.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.000
So Niantic has a little bit of experience with this.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Also, speaking of Niantic and things that they're doing involving Pokemon Go,

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:20.000
you may or may not remember, there's a class-action lawsuit that was filed about Pokemon Go Fest,

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:26.000
and this was because people paid money to travel, fly into, stay in hotels at the Pokemon Go Fest,

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
only to have the game not fucking work.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Now, people were already given, what, the cost of their ticket back and, like, $100 in Pokemon Go currency.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Well, Niantic just settled a class-action lawsuit over the festival, $1.57 million to settle this.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:52.000
There's going to be an official website that will open by May 25th, and this payout will help cover hotel and transportation costs.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000
You have to read the fine print, though, if you were affected by this.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
You will need evidence that you were there.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.000
You have to have checked into the festival on Pokemon Go, meaning you didn't sell your ticket to somebody else.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:06.000
You have to show receipts if there were more than $107 in expenses,

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.000
so be prepared to contact the hotel and get your folio and all that stuff.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And this may not, you may not get reimbursed dollar for dollar,

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
because lawyer fees are going to be impacted here and all this other stuff, too,

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:22.000
but you may at least be able to get some of it back, which I guess is better than nothing.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:28.000
So, a little bad news there on Pokemon Go, and I really just don't see them trying to do something of this scale again.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
They've been having a lot more success with the local community days, I think,

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.000
which we have a Mareep event coming up this Sunday.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Well, it's good, too, because, like, I hate, I wouldn't want to have to fly all the way to Chicago

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000
to play, like, an event like that. I like that it's anywhere.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Well, at least with Ingress, they kind of travel around to a lot of different cities,

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:54.000
although they seem to keep skipping Sacramento again and again, but that's another conversation.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000
At least we had one in San Francisco, which is a reasonably close distance,

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.000
and, like, they're doing one in San Diego, Las Vegas, Portland.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.000
So, you know, there's cities that we can get to in a reasonable amount of time and so forth,

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:10.000
so, by driving or whatever, so at least they're kind of doing these sorts of events.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.000
But Ingress just doesn't have nearly as many people as Pokemon Go has,

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
which is kind of how they can get away with it,

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000
and probably why they thought Pokemon Go Fest would not be any big deal,

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:25.000
because, remember, I missed an episode of OLR a couple years ago

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000
because I went to Chicago to participate in a Niantic event, and it was fine.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.000
It was Ingress, not Pokemon Go, but it went off fine.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Our phones worked.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:41.000
The only difficulty we ran into was that some dummy decided it would be a good idea to have a shard,

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000
which is one of the things you're trying to control, at Trump Tower.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000
I said, tump.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000
At Trump Tower, they actually had a shard spawn there,

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000
and this was, like, two days after those massive protests.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
You remember when there were all those protests after election day?

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Yeah.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Yeah, there were all these protests going on, so the police were out.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:01.000
We couldn't get to this shard, so we had to sneak in a dunk of donuts across the street and do it there,

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
and we got donuts.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Donuts and a shard.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
That's right, donuts and a shard.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000
It's win-win.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Actually, we lost the shard to the other team, because they had way more-

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
They also wanted donuts.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Well, they saw what we were doing, too, so they figured it out,

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000
but they also had way more fucking people than we did.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000
I remember my little team of, like, nine people, and we'd be standing there like,

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000
yeah, we're defending this portal, woo, and then it was a nighttime anomaly, right?

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000
So you'd see all these blue, which is the opposition color for me in the game,

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
you'd see all these blue glow sticks and blue lights down the street,

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000
slowly moving your direction as you were just sitting there going, ah, fuck.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
There's nothing we're going to be able to do.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
We're not going to be able to hold it against that many people.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000
But we had fun trying, and that's the important part.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
All right, let's move on.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Dark Sakura.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Well, last but not least for me, there may be potentially another Nier game.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:51:02.000
The creator of Nier Automata, that's Yoko Taro, and Yosuke Saito is the producer,

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.000
and Keiichi Okabe, who is the composer, actually answered some questions,

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
and of course the game came up quite a bit.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.000
And so while there weren't a few leaks out there,

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:19.000
there was a point where Saito spoke possibly about returning to the series.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000
So then of course it made everybody super happy,

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:29.000
but the quote is, I do think that we might be able to open the door in the Nier universe.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:34.000
I don't know how long it might take, but I do want you guys to look forward to that.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:42.000
So they did say that they weren't super happy with the idea of making a sequel,

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
but maybe something in the same universe.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
So there you go.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:52.000
I know a lot of people really want to see that series continue in one way or another,

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
so this will be good news, I guess.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Yeah, I think it would be hopefully pretty neat.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
So, I mean, it'd be nice.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000
I had the game on my wish list for a long time,

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:08.000
but maybe now, especially if they're going to do more with it, I'll be interested in playing it.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.000
All right, just a few more stories before we get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.000
all one word on Skype.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
But first, Loki.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:24.000
So, you may remember that there was, well, last year kind of started this whole really terrible loot box thing

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
where companies were kind of interjecting loot boxes in the games

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
where it really didn't have any place to be.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:36.000
One of those, of course, that can seem to be kind of ruined by this was Middle-Earth Shadow of War.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:45.000
So now, fast forward to this week, we get a comment from developers of the game,

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:50.000
or I should say the publisher of Warner Brothers, talking about what they're going to do to fix that.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000
And so they have decided that they're going to remove the loot boxes from the game.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000
They stated,

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:02.000
The core promise of the Nemesis system is the ability to build relationships with your personal allies and enemies

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
in a dynamic, open world.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:09.000
While purchasing Orcs in the market is more immediate and provides additional player options,

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:16.000
we have come to realize that providing this choice risks undermining the heart of our game, the Nemesis system.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:21.000
It allows you to miss out on awesome player stories you have otherwise created

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:26.000
and compromises those same stories if you don't buy anything.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:31.000
And simply being aware that they are available for the purchase reduces the immersion in the world

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:35.000
and takes away from the challenge of building your personal army and your fortresses.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.000
In order to fully restore the core promise of the Nemesis system,

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:44.000
we will be permanently removing gold, war chests, and the market from Shadow of War.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Removing it on July 17th, of course.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
That's almost a year after the game came out.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:58.000
So really, all this is to is try to save some face now that this stuff isn't selling as well as it used to.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Because, don't give me this shit that they didn't fucking know this ruined this from the get-go.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Because people were fucking telling them every single day that it was.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
So don't be fooled.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:15.000
It is nice, I guess, to see a lot of these companies are starting to go,

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
whoops, we maybe need to do a swift turnaround on this stuff.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
No, it's just the same face. They didn't feel bad for it.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
If they felt bad for it, they would have made ac...

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
They would have...

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Oh no, I'm not saying they felt bad.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.000
I'm just saying the reality is they realized they have to do this.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Alright.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
I just, I don't forgive them.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
I didn't buy the game, so, you know.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Me neither.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000
No skin off my back, so.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Alright.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Now I got one more story for you guys, and I saved the best for last.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Although, you have to file this in the category of rumors.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Jamie, I want you to try to not get too excited at what I'm about to say, okay?

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Try me.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:52.000
But apparently, Nintendo has recently been revamping the Animal Crossing site.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000
And in the revamp of this site, there's a lot of placeholders.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Placeholders in places like the news page and the video page.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000
So there are placeholders all over the place.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:09.000
In fact, the Twitter account Leak Review did a very detailed analysis about what this could all mean,

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.000
and how all these pages with Lauren Ipsum all over it and stuff,

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.000
where there's soon to be more copy for possibly some type of unannounced game.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.000
So Dark Sakura, you know what they might announce at E3.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Amiibo Festival 2.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Hey, you know what? I also wouldn't be unhappy by that.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Oh really? Oh yeah, sorry, you're like the one person I know that liked that game.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
You know, they have those Amiibos marked down a lot.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000
They're like two bucks.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000
I already own them all.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Yeah, I know.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Well, you can own second copies.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Buy me some. No, I'm just kidding.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
So, again, it's a stretch.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
We're reading the tea leaves the way we want to read them.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000
But, you know, it seems like wild hopes.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Perhaps, perhaps they're not bringing back Virtual Console

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.000
because they're going to include Virtual Console games within Animal Crossing.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Stop fucking with my emotions.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Well, you know about Amazon France had Animal Crossing 3D

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.000
as a placeholder for September 28th release.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Huh.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Yeah.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
3D, like another, oh god.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
They listed Animal Crossing 3D.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000
If they do another 3DS game, so help me god.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
I actually wouldn't be mad at it.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
I would.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I would.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
It is time for a fucking Switch game.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000
But, you know, it could just be a placeholder,

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000
but it was something on there, so.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000
All right.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Well, everybody brace yourselves to the upcoming Nintendo Direct.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
JD says, stop hating on the 3DS.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I am not hating on the 3DS.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:42.000
The 3DS is a great console from the years 2006 to 2016,

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
but it's time to move on.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
The Switch is here, yo.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000
All right.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
We'll see.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000
We'll see.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000
We'll see.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Anyway, if you want to give us a call and yell about Animal Crossing

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
or anything that's on your mind,

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.000
the Skype line is open now over at Orange Lounge Radio,

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
all one word on Skype if you want to get through.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Again, that is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000
JD says Nintendo is releasing stuff through 2019.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Yes, I know.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
The Luigi's Mansion remake no one asked for.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000
My Switch can't fit in my pocket like my 3DS can.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Well, you just need bigger pockets.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000
No, you know, JD, here's the thing.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Fuck gender roles.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
You get to carry a purse now.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000
It's a fanny pack.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
You get to carry a purse.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000
No, not a fanny pack.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.000
You are going to carry a man purse with you,

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:32.000
and you keep your Switch in your purse.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.000
JD says I would lose it.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Have you ever lost your purse, Dark Sakura?

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
They're pretty, I guess.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Never.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Yeah, I guess if you, I guess it could be,

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I could see like leaving, you know, I lost my little gotcha,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
the little Pokemon Go auto-catching thing.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.000
I lost that gotcha in a fucking lift in Atlanta

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.000
when I was there.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.000
I had to buy a new one.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Isn't that depressing?

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
I know I'm depressed.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
I'm depressed.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
All right, let's get to a call.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000
We have a call on the line.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Who's this?

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Hi, this is Ray Jeter.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Hey, Ray Jeter.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
What's on your mind?

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Not a whole lot.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000
You know, as you were mentioning,

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
towards the beginning of the show, you know,

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:15.000
for Episcopal Knights, you had been streaming Nino Kundi 2.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Yes, been streaming Nino Kundi 2, yep.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Yeah, in fact, I had caught the streams

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
and we were chatting about RPGs.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Now, all that being said,

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I'm going to make this call really to RPGs.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Yeah, I would like to pose this to the three of you

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.000
and if Chad wants the answer too, by all means, answer.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Okay, what's that?

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:46.000
At least you specifically are known to love RPGs.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Now, case in point, Mass Effect 3,

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
you bought that god damn sound many times.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:59:01.000
That being said, what game drew you into the RPG genre first

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.000
and why are you such a fan of this genre?

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
What game, and I'm going to open this to all our hosts

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
because I know you all like RPGs,

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
what game got you into the RPG genre

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
and what was it about that game that you enjoyed the most?

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.000
For me, it was honestly probably the original Dragon Warrior

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
because that's what they called it here on the NES.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
I mean, that's the first one I remember playing

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.000
that had the whole strategy guide that came with it and everything

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
because I could go further back to the 2600

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
and stuff like Adventure and things like that,

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000
but I mean, those were more kind of like action-based games.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I don't think you really got the roleplay in that same sense

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000
until we really got to the NES and some of those early games,

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
so that was kind of the early one for me.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
What did I like about those games?

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Probably the fact that they were a little more story-driven,

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.000
that it was an open world, even though when you kind of look back,

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
a lot of those early RPGs,

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
especially the original Final Fantasy and stuff,

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
they weren't as open as you think.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
You could go around one little part of the world

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000
and then it was like, oh, but to get to this world,

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.000
you're going to need a boat,

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
and to get to this thing, you're going to need an airship,

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
and to this thing, everything is kind of tunneled in that sense,

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.000
even in the earliest RPGs, but it did feel open,

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.000
and what I liked about it is that if you were kind of struggling

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
and having problems getting past a certain point,

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
you could kind of level up your character

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:19.000
and you could get past that point by just kind of like

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
persistence pays off.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.000
And that's true of other genres of games, too.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000
If you want to do good in a game like a platforming game

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
like, I don't know, Spyro, like we talked about earlier,

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000
if you have a difficult level,

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000
you got to keep practicing and practicing and practicing,

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
and again, eventually that persistence pays off.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.000
And I think in an RPG, especially those old JRPGs,

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000
you really felt that, which is why I'm really harsh

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
on Final Fantasy VIII sometimes,

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
because that is one of the first games I remember playing

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
where persistence didn't pay off,

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
because the enemies would level as you did

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
and there was this whole other system in it and stuff,

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
and so that's why, and again, I'm not trying to open up

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
this whole thing for debate again.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.000
It's not up for debate. How I feel is not up for debate.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000
But I respect that there are people that enjoy Final Fantasy VIII,

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.000
but for me, I just have a lot of negative connotations with it

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
because that is when I remember feeling like,

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.000
oh, this is an RPG that kind of doesn't have

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
a lot of what I've enjoyed in other games and so forth.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
But again, as far as Final Fantasy VIII goes,

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
the story is good if you're willing to put up

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.000
with the game mechanics to get there.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
So my problem was never the story.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000
And as RPGs kind of continued on, I think stories,

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
especially in games like Final Fantasy,

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000
when we got to VII, but even VI,

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
I mean, or when it was on the Super Nintendo

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
here in America when I was a teen, it was Final Fantasy III, right?

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Anybody my age that played Final Fantasy III in the US

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
at that age remembers that fucking opera scene.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000
And that's like the earliest version of a Final Fantasy cut scene

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.000
was the opera scene, and it was fantastic.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Anyway, I've blabbed long enough. How about my co-host?

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Loki, your first RPG, and what made you enjoy RPGs?

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Probably Dragon Warrior as well.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:01.000
I don't know. I don't remember a whole ton of what I played.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Early stuff. Like, I can't think of a particular RPG.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.000
I just know, like, I used to play a lot of the Final Fantasy games.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:13.000
I remember Final Fantasy III or VI was, you know, really good.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
But I mean, I don't know.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
I know one of the first games I played I know was on the NES,

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000
and that was Dragon Warrior.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.000
How about Dark Sakura?

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
I don't even fucking remember.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
I just always played them.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
It's always been part of your...

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.000
I mean, if you want to really go for it, I could probably say

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Quest for the Rings. You know, the...

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Oh, shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.000
On the Odyssey 2.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.000
On the Odyssey, yeah.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:38.000
We played a shitload of that game.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.000
So maybe you don't have that same recollection

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:44.000
because you played D&D so much and paper-based games.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
I didn't play D&D until I was older.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
I meant paper games, though.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Yeah, but I didn't play those until I was older.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Oh, really? I thought you'd been playing those all the time.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000
No, I'd been playing the video game ones when I was a kid.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Interesting.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
I mean, I guess if I was going to pick one,

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
I guess the Legend of the Rings would be...

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:04.000
or Quest for the Rings would be the closest thing to my first RPG ever.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:08.000
You know, and I did a lot of text-based RPGs,

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:13.000
and, you know, I really can't put my finger on it, you know.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000
It could just be because I'm, you know, heading toward my elderly years.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Since my birthday's in two weeks.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Phantasm Chat says,

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
I don't even fucking remember.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Y'all crack me up.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Hey, you know what?

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000
We can only give you truth here at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.000
and sometimes our brains don't fucking remember.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.000
That's how it goes.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.000
No, I'm getting on in years.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Shake my cane.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Some other random answers in chat.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Bobby Black Wolf says,

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.000
I had the A, D, and D games on Intellivision,

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.000
but I also didn't get them.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.000
You know, it may have been a little much for that age at the time.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Let's see.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Sia Tabiri says,

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:56.000
the big one that got me into RPGs was probably Popolacross on PSP,

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000
or Lunar for GBA.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000
I love Popolacross.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Let's see.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Kossen says,

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000
I played Final Fantasy 1,

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:05.000
and I was very glad to have the Nintendo Power issue dedicated to the game.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Kossen also says,

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Crystalis.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000
The thing about,

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Crystalis is like kind of RPG,

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.000
but there's this weird kind of like action element

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.000
where it's kind of in a similar bucket to like the original Zelda to me,

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
but certainly those games were just like gateway games,

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
you know, in a way.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Like would I have enjoyed the original Zelda as much

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
if I didn't have Nintendo Power?

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000
I don't know.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Like it would have been really hard.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
I'm not sure I would have ever gotten through the second quest

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.000
without Nintendo Power.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.000
I don't know.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
I don't remember how I got through the first quest.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.000
I know, right?

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Like we were just smarter then.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.000
I don't know how it is.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
All right.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Before I let you go, Spaznator,

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.000
or excuse me,

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000
I always say your Skype name.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Sorry, Raginator,

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000
but when I look at the screen,

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
it says something different.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Raginator,

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000
what about you?

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000
I'm flipping this question on you.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
What's the first RPG you remember playing,

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
and why did you keep playing it?

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
It's weird for me.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
You know,

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.000
I had both Final Fantasy 1

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:00.000
and Dragon Warrior for the NES,

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
but bear in mind,

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
back in those days,

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
my parents did all the game buying,

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
and you know,

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:10.000
a lot of times my father would buy games

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
with himself in mind,

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
so I just ended up playing it.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:19.000
And I thought those two games I just listed were all right,

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.000
but I truly didn't get into RPGs

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.000
until I got my PS1 back in 97.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:31.000
I happened to go up to my local Toys R Us,

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:35.000
and they had a kiosking place for PS1,

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:40.000
and they had a trailer for Wild Arms playing.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Oh, yeah.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Yeah, which included the opening cutscene.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:49.000
It's a side for anyone that has not played it.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.000
The opening cutscene was fully rendered,

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:57.000
FMV anime,

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:00.000
and I was just blown away by that.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
I ended up buying the game,

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
and once I got the game,

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
I found out,

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000
hey, you know,

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
there's actually a good game behind this,

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
not just a nice cutscene.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
It's more than just a pretty face.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Yeah, my second one,

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
which I got shortly after,

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
was Vandal Hearts,

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
which was put out by Konami.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Oh, I remember Vandal Hearts.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I played that too, yeah.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Yeah, really great story,

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000
turn-based, kind of like Final Fantasy Tactics,

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.000
and then what really blew me away,

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.000
even more so,

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Final Fantasy VII.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.000
It was so cinematic,

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
sweeping story, all that.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Oh, yeah.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Yeah, and once I played that game,

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.000
if I wasn't sold on the RPGs

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
based on the prior two games,

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
I was definitely sold then.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I'd start buying RPGs left and right.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:54.000
The only thing that pissed me off about Final Fantasy VII,

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
when I first played Final Fantasy VII,

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000
and I played a lot of that game.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.000
I missed a lot of college just playing Final Fantasy VII.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.000
When I first played through that game,

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000
the only thing that pissed me off

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
is that through the whole beginning of the game,

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Aeris was part of my core party.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000
It was like Cloud Aeris,

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:08.000
and I think I was using Barret.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.000
So I leveled her up a lot,

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I used her a lot,

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
and then all of a sudden,

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
she was removed from my party.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:15.000
So I was like,

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Really? Really?

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
All that weight? Really?

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000
When I saw the one moment that you're referring to,

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:28.000
I practically did a Darth Vader Revenge of the Sith moment.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.000
No!

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Yeah, right?

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Whereas Dark Sakura was over there going,

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Yes!

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Chad Michael's on Drag Race

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:38.000
when hearing that both queens would be saved that week.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Yes! Yes!

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
That was Dark Sakura.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.000
That was me.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.000
All right.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Anyway, Rage Nator,

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls,

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.000
but thanks for the question.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:49.000
I appreciate that.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Have a nice night, old potato.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Killing, killing, killing, killing.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
You know you got busted for that.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I'm hanging up on you for it now. Bye.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
All right, so the joke behind that is

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
there was this character in Ni No Kuni II,

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
and I called her an old potato.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
She dressed fierce, but she looked like an old potato.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:06.000
And I was like,

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
first person to tell me I'm that character or something

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.000
is gonna get a ban.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
And so, of course, Rage Nator says something,

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
so I actually clicked the button that timed him out.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
I thought it would only be like a two-minute timeout

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
or something where it would just shut him up for like two minutes.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
No, it was a ten-minute timeout.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:22.000
At least it wasn't a ban.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
But I made good on my promise.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Anyway, lots of love I'm seeing right now.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Dungeon Buster talking a lot about Phantasy Star

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
in the chat as well.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
It's a game that we kind of missed

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
in mentioning our favorite RPGs.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
By the way, if you want to give us a call,

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000
RPGs or anything else,

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
You know, my first memory with Phantasy Star though,

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
besides like seeing it in a magazine

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
and wanting to play it,

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000
because I basically was told as a kid

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000
it was Sega's version of Final Fantasy, right,

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
which we all know is a real oversimplification.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
But that's, you know, what it was as a kid.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Okay, I wanted to play it for that reason.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
But honestly, my first introduction to Phantasy Star

02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000
was Phantasy Star Online.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
And that game blew my fucking mind

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
like when I played that on the Dreamcast.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Like that was the reason.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.000
It was pretty awesome.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
And I didn't play it enough.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Yeah, and that was only a couple years before 11.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000
I had to go to the ER while playing the Xbox One.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
God, I wonder where that game is.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Oh, because you played too much.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.000
No, no, no, because I ended up having

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
cramps that almost made me pass out.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Oh my gosh.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
And I thought I might have had something else going on.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000
I wonder where that went.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
I had that game because it was one of the games I got,

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:27.000
because I actually won.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000
It's funny.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
I went to Accuse Our All-Nighter,

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
and they had a raffle there.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.000
And I entered the raffle, and I won a Dreamcast.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000
I was like, oh, okay, cool.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000
I have a Dreamcast now,

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:40.000
because I wasn't totally expecting to win anything.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.000
So then I remember buying a bunch of games,

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
and one of those was Phantasy Star Online.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
But I don't remember where it is now.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
I have a lot of my other games I found Tony Hawk.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Well, we wouldn't be able to play it online anymore anyway.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Well, I don't care about playing it online.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000
I was playing it offline anyways, because dial-up.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
I'm not going to do dial-up.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
I had it on Dreamcast,

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.000
but it was the voice chat of the Xbox version that got me.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Oh yeah, that was magic.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
When you could suddenly, like thanks to fast internet,

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
you could use voice chat.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
It's like playing telephone all the time.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
You should just bring it back.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Bring it back as backwards compatible,

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
and then add the voice chat in there.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Don't.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Don't.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Do.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Not.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Not.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Especially after we just had that story

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
about the Xbox backwards compatibility.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Do not play with my emotions like that,

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
because I will cry if that happens.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:32.000
I'm sure the next thing they'll bring back after that

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000
is going to be Game Room.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Oh my God.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Okay, now you're just making shit up.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.000
All right.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
One more shout out for our Skype line,

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word,

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000
and you can give us a call.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Do we have any last minute stories

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
before we wrap up shop tonight?

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
No, it's been a slow week.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Yeah, compared to other weeks,

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:50.000
it has been a little slower.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000
It has been a little slower, probably.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:54.000
One of the wrestlers in WrestleMania today

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
dressed up as Sub-Zero.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Oh yeah, that was all today, wasn't it?

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Yeah.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Oh yeah, I wondered why it seemed like

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
there were just a few less people than usual.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000
I haven't watched any actual wrestling in an age, so.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Why would they dress up like Sub-Zero?

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
What did Sami Zayn do during wrestling?

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
That's the only one that I have to keep tabs on,

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
because I'm apparently his twin.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
I just have to learn to dance like he does.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Anyway, DC Nate in our chat room says,

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.000
what a disappointment.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
I don't know if that's about WrestleMania or what,

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000
but yeah, anyway.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
All right, well, I don't see our Skype lighting up,

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
so I guess that means we're gonna wrap it up

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show tonight

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000
and participating with us.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.000
We appreciate all the feedback that we get from you guys

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:44.000
in our mailbag.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:49.000
and we also appreciate five star reviews

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
on a place like iTunes or Google Play

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
or wherever it is you heard about this show.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Those go a long way,

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
and we really appreciate those reviews as well.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000
We don't ask for your money.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
We just ask, hey, tell a friend about the show.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Help us spread the word,

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.000
but only if the voices are here to actually air them out.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:09.000
So, anyway, that's gonna do it for the show.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000
I guess now we will go around and give everybody's final thought.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Loki, you got the mic right there.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.000
I'll start with you.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:21.000
My final thought is I'm hopefully gonna work on my game this week.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:22.000
I don't know.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
It's been like it's however brain dead I am

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
after exercising and work in a whole day

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000
and being that I'm starting my new job tomorrow.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Congrats.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
We'll see how that goes

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:35.000
as far as what mental capacity I have left at the end of the day

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
to learn more about programming.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.000
My final thought is, hopefully,

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
my eating noises have not been coming through on the microphone,

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
but I've been chewing on some popcorn throughout this movie,

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
or throughout the movie, throughout the show,

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.000
and I need to stop eating these popcorn kernels

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.000
because it's dangerous.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000
It's so terrible for your teeth.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:54.000
But you know what is the best?

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
You know what's even better than popcorn

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
is those kernels that are like half popped.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Those are the best.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Somebody should figure out how to sell that.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000
You know what's the worst?

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Half pop popcorn.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
You know what's the worst?

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Whenever I eat popcorn for some stupid reason,

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000
you get one of those kernels

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.000
that just likes to get right in between your gums.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Oh, I have the solution for that.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000
I bought this thing for my teeth called a water pick,

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.000
and it was a good 60, 70 bucks on Amazon,

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
but you don't have to floss ever again

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
because that's what this thing is, is a floss thing.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000
You know what?

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.000
So you fill it up with water,

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000
and it's like a water gun.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
It's basically what your dentist will use on you,

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:28.000
like a lower version of that.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
And so if I get popcorn stuck in my teeth,

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
I just go in the bathroom and just spread the word.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Well, that works if you're at home

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
when I'm stumbling eating popcorn at work.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000
I'm like, ah, current.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:37.000
You know what?

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:38.000
I have something even cheaper than that.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:39.000
It's a metal pick.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
There you go.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Like a dentist pick, a real dentist pick.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000
All right.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:48.000
And that fits in my purse.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Yeah, Causton says,

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.000
have you guys tried using those plastic brush picks?

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Yeah, I used to use the little...

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Things are a fucking waste of money.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
The flossy pick things.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:58.000
I used them.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
But if I had a purse, I would put those in them.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.000
You can get a legit narrow metal dentist pick.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
And use that instead of floss.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Yeah.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
And you pay two bucks for it.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.000
And you can sterilize it and keep it with you.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000
As long as you sterilize it.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
And you don't have to fucking pay for anything else.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Those things can get nasty if you don't sterilize it.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Well, yeah, but that's, again, why you sterilize.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.000
It's boiling water.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.000
In an emergency, you can gouge someone's eye out with it.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:26.000
All right.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Anyway, Dark Sakura,

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
I don't want to leave without getting your final thought.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
What is your final thought tonight?

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Fuck it.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.000
I like that.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.000
We'll see you next week.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.000
We will be back in seven days to do it all over again.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
So hey, thanks for joining us.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Back here live or on our podcast feed.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Either way you did it.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
We appreciate you being here and we'll be back.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Seven days.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Bye.
