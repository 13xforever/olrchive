00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,900
This week Microsoft's new Xbox One update allows you to give input control to a mixer

2
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,900
stream viewer.

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,940
There are many possible uses for this and personally I'm excited to see them.

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,900
That's just one change in store, join us for the rest of the week's gaming news starting

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,980
right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,540
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back.

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,280
It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,500
It's Orange Lounge Radio, back live tonight, April the 29th, 2018, episode number 728 of

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
our show.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,180
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here in Studio N7, lovely Sacramento, California,

11
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,380
with my co-hosts over there, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,380
Hi.

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,380
Hi, how are you?

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,380
I'm here.

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,380
Good.

16
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,980
I'm excited for your DragCon event in two weeks, right?

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,980
Two weeks?

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,980
I'm ready and nervous.

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:09,020
I've got a lot of stuff to do and some of the things that I ordered are deceptively

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,980
not real human body size.

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,260
Can we talk about the outfit you were talking about before the show or is that going to

22
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,260
be a secret?

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,260
It's fine.

24
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,300
Because it's game related and I love it.

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,300
Which one was game related?

26
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,300
The Kirby.

27
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,940
Oh no, I wasn't going to do a Kirby outfit, I was going to do a top hat.

28
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,940
Oh, kind of.

29
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,380
As the hat challenge.

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,380
A Kirby.

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,500
It's more Drag Race related.

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
Alright, fine.

33
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Whatever.

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
I wasn't going to do Kirby at all.

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Oh, I thought it was a Kirby.

36
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
No.

37
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Oh, a Kirby.

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Oh, damn.

39
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
I thought that whole time you were going to...

40
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,180
I'm going to do a Kirby top hat.

41
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,180
I thought you were talking about a Kirby.

42
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:49,180
I mean, I could do a Kirby, Jiggly's already done it I think.

43
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,940
Now you need to do a Jiggly look.

44
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:57,980
No, if I was going to do one, I would do like a Q-Bone outfit with a skull on my head or

45
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,980
something.

46
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,980
Oh, okay.

47
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,980
I like that.

48
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,980
A little Pokemon.

49
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,980
Yeah.

50
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,980
Alright.

51
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,980
Pokemon, first drag at a ball.

52
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,980
Category is.

53
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,980
Alright.

54
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,420
But no, I have my Shirley Manson inspired outfit.

55
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,340
Hey, Shirley Manson is still awesome.

56
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,460
That's just depending on if I do Sister Face or if I do drag and if I do drag then I bust

57
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,260
out the Shirley Manson wig.

58
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,260
Alright.

59
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,180
Well, looking forward to seeing all that on your social medias in a couple of weeks when

60
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,180
that all goes down.

61
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,180
If I remember, I have one.

62
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,180
Alright.

63
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,180
Also say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

64
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,180
Hello.

65
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,180
Hi, Loki.

66
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,180
How are you?

67
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
I'm good.

68
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,180
Good.

69
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,180
Have you seen Ready Player One again this week at all?

70
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,580
No, I went and saw two other movies inside.

71
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,580
So I saw Avengers Infinity War.

72
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,580
Of course.

73
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,580
Everybody's seeing Avengers.

74
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,580
I didn't go see it.

75
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,580
I know.

76
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,580
I am so uncool.

77
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,580
I had a migraine last night.

78
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,580
I am so uncool.

79
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,220
And I'm not trying to be like that edgy guy that's like, I'm going to hate the popular

80
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,380
thing.

81
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,380
Dan saw it.

82
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,540
And I, I just, I haven't seen, okay, so like I saw this brilliant post.

83
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,540
It was on Facebook.

84
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,100
I don't see much that's brilliant on Facebook.

85
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,100
It already got spoiled for me.

86
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,580
But it was a, well, don't.

87
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,580
I'm not.

88
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,580
Okay.

89
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,140
Um, but you know, like there's like this flow chart that was like, this is the Marvel universe

90
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,960
and it showed like all these movies and how they're connected and the order it goes.

91
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:18,060
And I was like, I have seen that one, that one and that one.

92
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,700
It was like four movies on that entire chart I'd seen.

93
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,940
I'm like, I'm not, I still need to see Black Panther.

94
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,820
I've seen all of them, but Black Panthers.

95
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,740
So Oh my God, that's the one, like everybody did see both of the guardians of the galaxy

96
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,740
movies, right?

97
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,740
No.

98
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,740
Okay.

99
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
I'm kidnapping you.

100
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,740
I am the uncoolest.

101
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,300
I know the guardians of galaxy movies are the best.

102
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,920
It's on Netflix, dude.

103
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Is it the second one?

104
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,340
All right, well, well, I've got the Blu-rays anyways, but I want to play video games.

105
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,340
I don't have time for movies.

106
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,340
Okay.

107
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,340
Do it.

108
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,580
I do play them while you're watching the movie.

109
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,580
How was the other one?

110
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,580
The Quiet Place?

111
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,760
Cause I'd go see that because you don't need to see other movies first.

112
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,060
The Quiet Place is good.

113
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,820
Um, it was just a really intense, you know, edge of your seat horror movie, I guess.

114
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:07,340
Um, I can see, I heard a rumor that at one time they were trying to do that stupid nonsense

115
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,380
where, Oh, Hey, let's take these random movies and make them part of the Cloverfield universe.

116
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:18,900
And I could see how that could sort of be part of the Cloverfield universe in a very,

117
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,780
we're really stretching to see the connection here, but do you know what weird thing I read

118
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,780
this week?

119
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,260
And I don't even remember where maybe somebody in our chat room knows over at live.vognetwork.com

120
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,380
because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network, vognetwork.com

121
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,060
six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black Wolf show.

122
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,760
Although Bobby is on a little brief hiatus while he takes care of some other things.

123
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,300
So wishing Bobby well.

124
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,380
Um, but anyway, uh, so we are live, so join our chat room unless you're listening on the

125
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,380
podcast.

126
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,940
Then, um, you can go see the chat rooms open 24 seven.

127
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,300
There just might not be anybody there, but anyway, uh, where was I dang it, I was gonna

128
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,300
Cloverfield.

129
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,300
Oh yes.

130
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Okay.

131
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,540
So did you read the thing online about how the Tomb Raider movie, there was a proposal

132
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:07,180
that that would be in the same universe as just cause hit man, um, all the other stuff

133
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,280
that like they want to turn into movies from like American game studios specifically I'd

134
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,680
asked fine with it, but I like, how would that cross over though, Laura Croft and hit

135
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,740
man and like they all, I don't know, but that would be an awesome, awesome to do what exactly

136
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,220
I regal Rodriguez in, you know, Laura Croft.

137
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,260
I'm down, I'm down for just a just cause movie, honestly, because that's gonna be batshit

138
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,260
insane.

139
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,260
You gotta have Jason Statham.

140
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:41,260
That's totally un, you know, not going to match the nationality of the main character

141
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,260
at all.

142
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,240
But I just see something like that has to be as crazy as like one of the crank movies

143
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
or something.

144
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Right.

145
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,060
But yeah, I'm down with something like that.

146
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,740
I just, I haven't watched any of the hitman movies, so I don't really know how those would

147
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,460
really play into it, but sure.

148
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,460
Why not?

149
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,700
Everyone's wants to make a cinematic universe.

150
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,180
Uh, let's see tiger call out chat over at live.vog network.com says a video game cinematic

151
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,180
universe.

152
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,300
I'm not going to have that with ready player one kind of that's a stretch.

153
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
That's a stretch.

154
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Anyway.

155
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,300
All right.

156
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
Uh, let's see.

157
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,300
So, okay.

158
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Uh, something else I have to address with you.

159
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,300
Well, let me come back.

160
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,300
Cause I have to introduce, we have a guest in studio.

161
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,840
We always want to say hello to our guests because we haven't had a guest in studio in

162
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,580
like a long time, but, uh, we have an old fave back here on the show this week.

163
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,300
Say hello to longtime music, game, fan, lover, et cetera.

164
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,300
JD.

165
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
Hey.

166
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
Hi.

167
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
How are you?

168
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,300
I'm doing pretty well.

169
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Yeah.

170
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,620
Um, I mean, not much any movies.

171
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,620
Oh yeah.

172
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,300
I saw a game night a couple of weeks ago.

173
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,300
Okay.

174
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,300
That's like board game night.

175
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Right?

176
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Yeah.

177
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,740
I mean, it's a thriller about board games and a friend group.

178
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,740
Like it's pretty fun.

179
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,740
I didn't know that's a thriller.

180
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,060
I thought it was a comedy.

181
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,060
It's a comedy thriller.

182
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,060
Oh, cause I was like, Oh, so like scream.

183
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,060
Yeah.

184
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,220
Or, or well more like, like scream three that when they started getting a little more batshit,

185
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,780
I've only seen the first one.

186
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,700
Oh, well you're not missing much.

187
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,540
Scream two and three are like, okay, they're, they're worth your time, but not when you're

188
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,500
behind on 70,000 Marvel movies.

189
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Like I am.

190
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
All right.

191
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Yeah.

192
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
I've been like, nothing's new in my life.

193
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Okay.

194
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
That's cool.

195
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Uh, but you're, you're doing more Pokemon go.

196
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
We had fun playing that.

197
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Yeah.

198
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Right.

199
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Yeah.

200
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Yeah.

201
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
It comes in and goes like when there's events, I'll log in and when there's not, you know,

202
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,980
but we'll cover that on my gaming week.

203
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,980
Okay.

204
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,400
Cause I was going to say he's downplaying it just a little bit because this whole weekend

205
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,320
as we've been going around from place to place, it'll be like, Ooh, Wailmer, Ooh, Magikarp,

206
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Ooh, Wailmer.

207
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,040
Well, see, I have a lot of catching up to do cause I don't play all the time.

208
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
I understand.

209
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
I understand.

210
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,720
That's the great thing about these events though, is that they allow you to catch up.

211
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Right.

212
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
All right.

213
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,960
Well, we'll come back to you during your gaming week then and get the full pogo story, but

214
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
let's go to Loki.

215
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,720
Um, before we get to the kickoff topic, I think this is worth addressing because you've

216
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,460
been alluding to this on social media.

217
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,800
And then you came in here tonight and said, Rob, I need to borrow some of your amiibo.

218
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
I'm not borrowing.

219
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,320
I have it with me.

220
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,160
So I know, I know, but that's like, you're, you're borrowing it for five seconds.

221
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,760
You're not like longterm borrowing it.

222
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,480
But then I kind of went click, click, click, wait a minute.

223
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,080
There was a photo of his kid playing a switch.

224
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,240
Did you finally buy Nintendo switch?

225
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,560
Yes, we, we traded in the Wii U system that you got me a while back and how could you

226
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
trade a gift?

227
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
No, I'm kidding.

228
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
It's totally cool.

229
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
That's, that's what happens in gaming.

230
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,040
Well, I didn't want to, but the, the rule is my wife, wife said you have to get rid

231
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,640
of something in order to get something new.

232
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,400
So it's a worthy upgrade and it is it.

233
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,480
It's bittersweet, I guess, because my son, he really, really wanted to switch, but at

234
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,800
the same time he's like, Oh, I, I'm playing through super Mario three D world right now.

235
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,680
And it's like, I'm almost finished with it.

236
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,720
I'm like, well, you sure you want to get switched in?

237
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,480
We can, you know, do this another time.

238
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
No, no, no.

239
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
I want to get switched.

240
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
And then we got switched.

241
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,280
He's like, man, I kind of wish we didn't get a switch cause I wanted to play there, but,

242
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,400
yeah, he's been playing nonstop, you know, Mario Odyssey and always focus on that one.

243
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,720
So we got a switch and, um, did all that.

244
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,160
But so I just, I just want the Nintendo fans who, who all Loki sometimes ruffles their

245
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
feathers.

246
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,120
I just want the date and time noted.

247
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,000
Loki is finally on board with a switch.

248
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
There we go.

249
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah.

250
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,560
So now I can hate on it, you know, you know, from firsthand experience on it with, uh,

251
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,240
with, uh, like seriously, like when the e-shop, like, geez.

252
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,560
Way to put no effort into that interface.

253
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,120
Like that's even less interface or less effort into an interface than there was on the Wii.

254
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,520
I mean, it's ridiculous.

255
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,560
Oh, dark Tetsuya in chat says, I got a request from Loki on my system.

256
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,880
Wondering if I should do the same since I don't even use my Wii U anymore.

257
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Oh, I guess I should log into my switch and see if Loki sent me a friend request.

258
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,880
I didn't because you're not linked to Facebook or Twitter.

259
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
So apparently not.

260
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,340
I unlinked all of that stuff on purpose though.

261
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,140
So I just haven't bothered to go out and share the friend code that I have.

262
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,940
Um, I just was really quickly going through and just doing it through the system.

263
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,180
I'm like, okay, we'll see if this is all linked together and everything.

264
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,460
So I did all that.

265
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,460
Yeah.

266
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,580
Dungeon buster in chat says Loki now has authoritative Nintendo hate.

267
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,960
Oh, absolutely.

268
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,860
So I hate because I love, that's right.

269
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,860
What games?

270
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,860
Yeah.

271
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,860
You're the Tyra Banks of the show.

272
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,840
What was the, um, what was the, uh, games you got?

273
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,340
You said Mario Odyssey, Mario Odyssey and Mario Kart 8.

274
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,340
Mario Kart 8.

275
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,340
I like the two.

276
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,340
No Zelda yet.

277
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,580
No, because I didn't play, you had Zelda on the Wii U.

278
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,460
I had, well, I didn't play it on the Wii U and that's, I didn't play it very much.

279
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,460
Okay.

280
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,580
You know, so I will get Zelda at one point, but I'm like, I'm not gonna buy another game.

281
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,140
I'm not going to get to right away.

282
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,460
I'll pick it up later.

283
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,560
Um, I'm in no hurry yet.

284
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:48,000
We have a, I bought a 128 gigabyte memory card, so I'm just gonna download stuff as

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,540
I feel like it, but I just, I know I'm not going to get to Zelda right now, so I'm not

286
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,500
going to buy it right now because it, I mean, all those accessories and everything are so

287
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
expensive.

288
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,980
Nintendo stuff like never goes on sale either.

289
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,460
Like you're still, you're still going to pay 60 bucks for Zelda, right?

290
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,980
And I'm not, you know, I'm not worried about that, but I'm just saying I don't want to

291
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,580
pick it up right now because I'm not going to get to it right now.

292
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,040
I'll just play through Mario Odyssey for now and then all the other games on the other

293
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,380
systems I have and oh shit, there's my scene backlog.

294
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,080
You know, it's like there's too much.

295
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,400
What about Splatoon?

296
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
I don't like Splatoon.

297
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Okay.

298
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,460
I mean, I bought the first Splatoon and I was like, oh yeah, it's gonna be awesome.

299
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,460
I never played it.

300
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,640
I'll lend you my copy of Arms.

301
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,080
I know that really does not look good.

302
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,880
The kids will think it's fun though.

303
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
That's a good point.

304
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Let the kids try it.

305
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,640
I mean, they might like that, but like, and then that's a problem because they don't have

306
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
to buy it.

307
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Well, no, not really.

308
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
I mean, it's Splatoon.

309
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,000
It's just like, I just don't think I'll play it.

310
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,520
I mean, that's a problem.

311
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,560
How about Smash Brothers this holiday?

312
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,360
I'll pick, I'll pick up Smash Brothers when it comes out.

313
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
That's a must have.

314
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,880
I like Smash Brothers, but like, I just didn't want, like, and I even thought about Splatoon

315
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,680
2 and like, no, I didn't play the first one.

316
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,640
I just didn't really get into it.

317
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,040
Over in chat at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, is there an Arms demo Loki can

318
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
try?

319
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,880
They had a test fire or whatever they called it, an Arms fire or whatever they called that

320
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
thing.

321
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,080
They have demos for some things and I may pick those up.

322
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,880
They had one previously, but isn't there, wouldn't there supposed to be more Arms like

323
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,320
for some reason, like coming up in the coming weeks?

324
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,960
Like maybe they're trying to get more people to buy Arms.

325
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
I don't know.

326
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,080
I believe they had a free weekend a couple of weeks ago and they've been doing it every

327
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
so often.

328
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
They're already passed.

329
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
I'll check it out when it's free.

330
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,240
I mean, it just didn't look very interesting.

331
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,200
I'm very disappointed and I mean, I know a lot of people have shared this complaint,

332
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,080
but like one of the things like I brought when I got in the system was like, it would

333
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,120
have been nice to be able to pick up all those virtual console games I had already.

334
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,520
They're literally losing out money because I would have dropped money for all those games

335
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
they have in there.

336
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,040
You know, like Mario 64, that was the other game that he was playing through.

337
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,200
He was playing through Mario 64.

338
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,960
I would have downloaded Mario 64 again.

339
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,840
I would have paid the full $10 or whatever the fucking ridiculous price for virtual console

340
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,640
game again, but they didn't have it available.

341
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,760
So they're literally losing money because of that.

342
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,200
So guess what I'm going to have to do instead?

343
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,520
I'm just saying they put it on emulator.

344
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,080
So sorry Nintendo, you had an opportunity to get much more money from me, but because

345
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,760
of whatever bullshit excuse you're going to use, you didn't.

346
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,160
Well, we have some news coming up later in the show that maybe we'll finally get word

347
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,440
on what's happening on Mario 64 and the other virtual console stuff, but we will get to

348
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,000
that later in the show.

349
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,720
Let's jump into our kickoff topic tonight, which actually has nothing to do with Nintendo

350
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
and our gaming weeks.

351
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Yes, of course.

352
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Our gaming weeks as well.

353
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,060
We'll start with our kickoff topic as we usually do here at the top of the show, which has

354
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,240
to do not with Nintendo, but with Microsoft.

355
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
Right?

356
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Yeah.

357
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,600
So Microsoft and discord are, I guess, teaming up.

358
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,720
And so they have this, um, Xbox heart discord thing where you can link your account, sync

359
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,280
your friends, and I guess, um, display which games you're playing.

360
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,840
I don't want to sync my friends.

361
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,560
I like them.

362
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,860
So yeah, you can do that on PC and console and, um, it's interesting.

363
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,400
So how it works is it doesn't sound like it's much like, it's not like Xbox live is suddenly

364
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,540
integrating discord chattery that it's just like, uh, it's like how discord, uh, integrated

365
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,100
Spotify not that long ago.

366
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,540
You can see what people are listening to on Spotify, but that's it.

367
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,540
It's just their little stuff.

368
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,380
Maybe you can share stuff to it because they have a basic lens, the same.

369
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,060
It's linking like a social media account.

370
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,180
So like Facebook and Twitter, so you can like maybe post to it, you know, Hey, I just got

371
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,180
this achievement or something.

372
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,180
Yeah.

373
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,180
Then maybe, maybe you'll be able to do things like that.

374
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,040
But I think also like if you look on the sidebar, like, you know, cause, cause vog network has

375
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,100
a discord, cheap plug, cheap plug.

376
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,060
And so you'll see me on that discord and you can actually see what games I'm like as I,

377
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,640
I let it post, it's not a big deal.

378
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,340
You can actually see when I'm playing stuff on PC, you can see that, you know, Rob Roberts

379
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,880
is currently playing Diablo three, which has been a lot this week if, if I'm playing it

380
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
on PC.

381
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,200
But if I'm playing these on console, like if I'm playing DJ max on PlayStation four,

382
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,140
you don't see that on discord because the PlayStation doesn't talk to discord.

383
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,540
But now Microsoft will do that.

384
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,780
It sounds like, so you'll be able to see Rob Roberts is playing, I don't know, what do

385
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,300
I play on Xbox one anymore?

386
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,500
What was I was playing the Gianna sisters game this week to spoil my, my gaming week

387
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
a little bit.

388
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,740
So let's say Rob Roberts is playing Gianna sisters, twisted dreams or whatever.

389
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,180
And so maybe you decide, Oh, I want to join him in that game.

390
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,900
You could, you would know from your desktop discord or even your mobile that, Oh, Rob's

391
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,260
playing Gianna sisters.

392
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,820
I could jump in and join him right now or whatever it is on Xbox.

393
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,260
I mean, that's a neat for a lot of people I'm sure, right?

394
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,740
So yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm into this idea, but I mean it, it doesn't sound like it's

395
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,280
this gigantic Alliance.

396
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,120
It's just, Oh, discord is going to show your Xbox activity now.

397
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
Cool.

398
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,040
But it's still kind of like, this is a nice little foot in the door for Microsoft because

399
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,040
I think discord is one of those things in gaming and kind of what I wanted to talk about

400
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,240
here a little bit at the top of the show.

401
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,400
Discord's really been blowing up and gaming like, you know, nobody knew what discord was

402
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,400
what like two months ago or I'm sorry, not too much, two years ago.

403
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:06,540
Discord basically took the concept of chat and especially like team speak servers that

404
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,880
people were paying money for.

405
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,760
I think that's the big thing and made it free.

406
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,680
I'm not completely sure how discord is making enough money to keep those servers afloat.

407
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,160
I know they sell their premium subscriptions and things like that, but I don't know how

408
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,080
many people are actually buying those cause you can create servers for free.

409
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,680
There's a lot of conspiracy thoughts about like what discord might be doing with your

410
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
data.

411
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,360
Oh, they might be selling the play data or something or who knows, but like it's, it's

412
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,920
a Facebook kind of situation where it's like, well, if you don't, if you're not paying for

413
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,080
it, you are the product.

414
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Yeah.

415
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
Yeah.

416
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
So, so who knows?

417
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,640
But anyway, uh, discord's like blown up and I think especially you got two big things

418
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,920
to thank for discord blown up.

419
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,760
One of them is Pokemon go.

420
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,360
Like I, I mean, I know not everybody out there plays Pokemon go, but if you do play Pokemon

421
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,120
go because there is no chat within Pokemon go and this rating thing is such a big deal

422
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,880
and you've got to find other people to raid with.

423
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,680
Like discord has really taken over for Pokemon go.

424
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,300
That's how you find out where raids are and know when people are going to be there.

425
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,160
And I think so many people that necessarily wouldn't even necessarily play other games

426
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,440
because you know, there's plenty of people out there who play Pokemon go and don't play

427
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,200
other games, I think are getting exposed to discord and all of this stuff.

428
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,080
And then I think the other big thing that has really caused discord to blow up is Nintendo

429
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,080
because Nintendo doesn't really have an online solution.

430
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,880
A lot of people are going to discord to do their chats.

431
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,960
I mean, granted, there's, there's other stuff too, like MMOs, like all the people that were

432
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,080
using TeamSpeak before, like to do their raids, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy, Guild Wars,

433
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,720
all those MMOs online.

434
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,560
You know, why would people pay for a TeamSpeak server when you just go to their discord now?

435
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:48,120
So you know, discord is really, I think, wedge their foot in the door with all these different,

436
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
different things.

437
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,560
And so I think it's, it's really kind of transformed in some ways, a lot of the gaming stuff.

438
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,400
So it's interesting that discord is continuing to be like one unified kind of gaming ecosystem

439
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,840
instead of like Xbox Live being in their own bubble and PlayStation being in their own

440
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
bubble and so forth.

441
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,280
Because if you use discord, you can chat to anybody playing anything because the fact

442
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,800
that it's mobile is a big deal.

443
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Yeah.

444
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:16,000
Uh, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Tiger Claw says, indeed, you can start your

445
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,120
own community in discord, which is what we did at VOG network.

446
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,880
And if you want to join our discord, you can over at vognetwork.com slash discord,

447
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,120
and that will just give you the invite.

448
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,320
You don't have to worry about an invite code because it'll just put it right in there for

449
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
you.

450
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,320
So we, uh, we, we want anybody to join.

451
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,560
Um, well, as long as you're not a dick, that's the general rule, right?

452
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,160
As Joan Hunter-Matt says, I'm worried someone will buy discord sometime soon and turn it

453
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,280
into an exclusivicity war.

454
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,760
Um, perhaps Microsoft would be a worthy suitor, huh?

455
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,320
However, blueberry follows that up in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, discord

456
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,020
has denied buyouts several times.

457
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:02,280
So anyway, uh, and Tiger Claw also points out the great thing about discord is you can

458
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,240
connect to multiple servers at once.

459
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
Oh, absolutely.

460
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,080
I mean, obviously I have the VOG network one, but I'm probably on like 10 different servers.

461
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,520
Uh, and that's, I think that's small fry compared to a lot of people I've heard of some people

462
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
that have filled it up.

463
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,080
Like guys, I think you can only be on like a hundred different servers.

464
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,640
Yeah, I haven't really messed with discord too much, but it seems interesting.

465
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Yeah.

466
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,400
How do you even with a hundred servers, like who has time for that?

467
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,120
Well, I think some of them are more like, like it seems like everybody starts their

468
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,120
own server.

469
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,720
I think if you're like a Twitch person, all the Twitch people you follow probably have

470
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,120
their own servers.

471
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,180
Um, I decided to buy in more to the idea of together we are stronger, which is why I throw

472
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,180
all my Twitch.

473
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,100
Even though I do broadcast on Twitch instead of using my own server, which I started one,

474
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,180
but like the only people in it are Alan and I, because I was like, you know what, I'm

475
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,560
going to throw my, my w whatever weight this is, it's not much weight, but, uh, behind

476
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,720
the VOG server, you know, to try to get more people in one place type of thing.

477
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,220
But I know a lot of Twitch streamers will have their own servers.

478
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:08,940
Um, plus a lot of like, I have two for Pokemon go cause I have Pokemon go for the Sacramento

479
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,780
area, but then they also have an X-rays server dedicated to the, the, um, you too.

480
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,460
I always say Meowth raids with the Mewtwo raids that happened with, um, uh, Pokemon

481
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
go.

482
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,820
So I have two just for that.

483
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,900
And then I have like a, when I was playing Warcraft for a hot minute, I was in a Warcraft

484
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,500
Guild chat.

485
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,220
I was, I'm still in a final fantasy 14.

486
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,720
I'm in like two or three final fantasy 14 ones.

487
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,020
So it's just that caps out at maybe 15 though.

488
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,460
Like I'm talking like you have a hundred, how do you keep up with all of that?

489
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,460
It's a lot.

490
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,460
So overwhelmed.

491
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,460
It is a lot.

492
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
It's a lot.

493
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,540
Live.vognetwork.com dark Tetsuya says, I do have some of the Twitch folks I follow also

494
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,180
follow their discords.

495
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,460
There's always discussion going on, or they also have image boards or places to share

496
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
music.

497
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
Good point.

498
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,300
Uh, Rama on the whole Microsoft and discord thing says, no, Microsoft is still working

499
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,340
on Skype.

500
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,900
They're shutting down Skype for business and merging it into Microsoft teams.

501
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:13,020
It's Slack's competitor, which well, discord is kind of like Slack in a way, but with the

502
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,820
team speak element and all that.

503
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,100
I wouldn't really say discord is Slack's competitor, even though they're very similar services

504
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:27,540
because Slack is extremely aimed at businesses and Microsoft teams is also going after businesses.

505
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,300
Discord is not going for the professional users.

506
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,300
Okay.

507
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,040
But like, here's, here's the funny thing.

508
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:41,040
So when it comes to Slack, I am in probably 12 different Slacks, 11 of them are ingress

509
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
related.

510
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
Oh yeah.

511
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Yeah.

512
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,520
Like I think ingress got on Slack because Slack was out before discord.

513
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,720
I think, I think it's exactly what it is because there's been that talk about should, should

514
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,560
we be using discord as an ingress thing?

515
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,200
But the problem is now all this customization has been done for Slack.

516
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,320
People want to get off of it.

517
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,600
Well, I mean, I have both Slack and discord and I like Slack a lot better, but so like,

518
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,800
I feel like people who are used to Slack don't want to switch over to discord because

519
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,720
they feel very different, but right now I hear that.

520
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,900
But Slack also like misses certain features.

521
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,160
Make sure you're nice and in that microphone cause you're being very quiet right now.

522
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Sorry.

523
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,320
Slack is missing specific gaming related features like ignoring people, you know, because it's,

524
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,520
Oh, well it's a business tool, right?

525
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,920
Which is a whole other argument that we don't need to get into.

526
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
What?

527
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,200
I can't ignore my coworkers?

528
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,980
But what's funny to me is that we've never used Slack in my work environments.

529
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,960
Now granted, I've historically worked in healthcare and I would imagine using Slack and their

530
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,200
servers is probably not good for HIPAA and those types of losses probably why I did Slack

531
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
is never really.

532
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Yep.

533
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
I don't know.

534
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,840
Then maybe they do have the high encryption, but for whatever reason, the companies I've

535
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
worked for don't use it.

536
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,040
We use some type of instant messaging that's in house.

537
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,720
Doesn't Salesforce have their own like group message thing cause it's shit.

538
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,640
It's Salesforce, so yes, but no, the, my point is like a lot of companies are like, Oh, we're

539
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,440
already in on this one thing.

540
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,880
We'll just use whatever chat I guess.

541
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,280
If you're talking about like chatter, then that is shit.

542
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,520
But no, my knowledge of Salesforce is very small, but like for what my company uses for,

543
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
it's great.

544
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,080
But we use, I think we're using like one tiny branch of this huge mungus tree.

545
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,960
So and they have so many ways because of my Salesforce, it could be something that we

546
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,800
just don't use, which is very, very, very possible.

547
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
True.

548
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,320
Uh, looking at chat over at live.voggenower.com, Tiger cloud points out a great thing about

549
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,960
discord is you can use it anywhere since you can use the mobile app.

550
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,400
You can even use voice chat on the mobile app, post pics from your phone.

551
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,800
I think that is a big part about why discord has succeeded in such a big way too is because

552
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
of that.

553
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,920
You know, like who doesn't have a smartphone in this day and age, right?

554
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,080
No, RageNator finally got a smartphone.

555
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,940
So I mean like, oh, and Daniel Day Lewis still uses a flip phone.

556
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,160
We saw that on social media.

557
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
Okay.

558
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,240
But most like 99% of people have smartphones at this point.

559
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,200
So uh, when it comes to the smartphones, like, you know, you, you're gaming on your console.

560
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,400
It's very easy to just have your smartphone right there with your little earbud in or

561
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,680
just even on speaker or whatever.

562
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,480
It's like you have this chat device with you even when Nintendo doesn't have anything.

563
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,600
Although those features are not exclusive to discord.

564
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,420
Like the Slack app also has, you can upload pictures, you can do voice calls, like all

565
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,420
sorts of things.

566
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,920
Like I'm not trying to like say one or the other, I'm just saying these are common features.

567
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,120
So why do you think the gamers have gravitated towards discord instead of Slack?

568
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
It's easier to invite people.

569
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,720
Slack, you have to have one admin who like has to approve everyone because like in a

570
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,160
business environment, you don't just want anyone joining.

571
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
You know what?

572
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,000
That is a damn good point because I can, I don't think there's a problem with me saying

573
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
this.

574
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,860
Uh, if, if there was, I'll hear it from Bobby later.

575
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:57,740
But VOG network looked into getting a Slack, um, before discord was really big.

576
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,780
And there were some people that were saying, Oh, you should definitely get VOG on Slack.

577
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,100
You could do your chat and all this stuff.

578
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,180
And we were kind of looking into it, but the thing that stopped us was what you just said.

579
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
Yeah.

580
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,800
The nice thing about the way the chat is at OLR right now is that you go onto the site,

581
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,940
you just click and you're in.

582
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,820
But with Slack, somebody would have to invite you and you wouldn't like, you know, that

583
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,760
doesn't lend itself well to the instant gratification and that whole thing.

584
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,960
The other part is that discord is almost entirely free and Slack is very much aimed

585
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,480
at getting you to upgrade to an enterprise solution.

586
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,440
So like my Guild Wars Guild uses Slack because of reasons and we are constantly running into,

587
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,640
Oh, you can only show like, I think it's 10,000 messages on the free account.

588
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Yeah.

589
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,280
And that goes by in like, I don't know.

590
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,720
It's depending on how busy we are.

591
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,160
It's the storage and image thing in Ingress.

592
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,600
Go delete all your images.

593
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,760
Because everybody's posting like, Oh, here's a field.

594
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Here's my badge.

595
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
I got it.

596
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,700
Everybody's posting all their stuff from their cell phone.

597
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,880
It fills up the image thing so fucking fast.

598
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
Right.

599
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,080
So like that's the other reason because discord doesn't do that.

600
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,340
You can search for it eventually.

601
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,000
I think I don't know enough about discord to say, but like they don't like push you

602
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,080
at, Oh, you're running out of image space, running out of message space, you should upgrade

603
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,420
and each the upgrade is like priced per user.

604
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,480
So like any sizable gaming community is not going to do that.

605
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,360
Tiger con chat says how long until someone goes into a movie theater, turn on the voice

606
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,280
chat and then you hear the movie coming through the voice chat.

607
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,040
We wouldn't be able to see the movie that way, but I'm sure, I'm sure there are people

608
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,560
that have a Periscope.

609
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
That was the thing.

610
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,800
I don't, I don't, I don't hear much about Periscope anymore.

611
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,720
Twitter bought it and then kind of let it die.

612
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Just like they didn't rise.

613
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,880
Um, you know, just like they did vine.

614
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,800
Uh, don't let Twitter buy your company vine coming back.

615
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,640
I thought vine was coming back.

616
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,660
I think the founder said, gosh, this is terrible.

617
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:53,780
They killed my products and is trying to bring it back, but anyway, but my point with

618
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,860
that is that they were doing that with Periscope, right?

619
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,540
People were shooting at the movie, uh, the movie.

620
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,980
And that's, that's why sometimes the esters will come in and look at the eye because I

621
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,220
want to make sure you're not filming the movie.

622
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,540
Uh, but then the other big thing was a game of Thrones episodes were going on Periscope,

623
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,380
uh, and like the, the big pay-per-view stuff, the Wrestle manias and the MMA is and all

624
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,380
that stuff that was, that's huge.

625
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,900
Probably still is a problem on Periscope.

626
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,420
Honestly, I just, who's, who's uses I, I, you know what?

627
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,700
Old Periscope fucking Instagram stories.

628
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,140
I thought that was snap.

629
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,540
They were killing snapshot with the both.

630
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:31,460
You know, game of Thrones, like speaking of their piracy, like threatened, Oh, we'll pay

631
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,660
somebody and we'll just release all of the spoilers like ahead of the season.

632
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,660
Huh?

633
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,340
That was a thing a couple of weeks ago.

634
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
I remember that.

635
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,340
I remember that.

636
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,340
Uh, let's see.

637
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,660
Also a tiger class says there's a going around YouTube that I discovered this weekend where

638
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,300
they post audio of an audience reacting to infinity war.

639
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,300
They don't show video, but rather audio of the audience reacting to certain scenes from

640
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,300
the movie.

641
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,240
So they aren't playing the entire movie.

642
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,580
I've kind of seen that before.

643
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,940
They've done that in marketing.

644
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,500
Remember the very first paranormal activity?

645
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,720
Like I remember the early trailer for that movie.

646
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,640
It wasn't even really showing the movie.

647
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,420
It was showing the audience's reaction to things in the movie.

648
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,780
The movie was lame.

649
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,780
Yeah.

650
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,140
So, but that was how they sold and pro I want to say Blair witch project, I think did some

651
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,140
of that too.

652
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,880
Like those, those low budget movies that are super fucking scary.

653
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,840
That's kind of how they sell them sometimes is showing the reaction to the movies.

654
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,480
Didn't Blair witch project come out before YouTube was founded?

655
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,840
Like how did they do reactions?

656
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,760
You know, it was in the trailer.

657
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
Oh, in the trailer.

658
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Remember?

659
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
Oh, got it.

660
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Yeah.

661
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,100
JD, I know you're a young kid, but back in my day, if you wanted to see a new trailer,

662
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,800
you had to go see another movie.

663
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,880
I thought you meant they posted a trail, like a separate, like, I think when Blair witch

664
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,800
project came out, you had to download a quick time.

665
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,920
There was no YouTube, but you could like go to MTV.com and get a quick time or something.

666
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Real media.

667
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Yes.

668
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
Real player.

669
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
Yeah.

670
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,120
Or you just had to go on to like watch TV shows and they'd have a trailer from playing

671
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,080
an exclusive trailer from Blair witch project after entertainment tonight.

672
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,400
They still kind of do that though.

673
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Yeah, they do.

674
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
Yeah.

675
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
SSJ 100.

676
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Matt says used to be the Haven for pay-per-view and didn't that become Twitch?

677
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Oh yeah.

678
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Justin TV became Twitch.

679
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:18,120
I always thought there's always rumors that Justin's going to come back, but I kind of,

680
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,240
I don't think Justin TV is going to come back.

681
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,640
I think it's just going to be Twitch is going to get bigger.

682
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,080
That's that's what's going to happen.

683
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,000
I feel like Justin got his stock options and got very rich and is on an island somewhere.

684
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,320
Didn't Justin get let go or am I confusing him with somebody else?

685
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
I haven't kept up.

686
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,320
I know.

687
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,320
All right.

688
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,880
I won't go into that drama because I'll put my foot in my space.

689
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,200
Tom is taking, he's a photographer now.

690
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,200
My space.

691
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Dude, my space.

692
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,600
Tom has to have so much fucking money.

693
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,480
Didn't he sell that site when it was still a big deal or did he, did he, was he, was

694
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,840
he gone by the time it was in the ground?

695
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
I have no idea.

696
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,640
Did he sell it to Justin Timberlake or something?

697
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,120
I have no idea.

698
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
God.

699
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,320
Anyway, uh, let's see.

700
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,200
Uh, also in chat at live.vognetwork.com, uh, let's see a dark tissue says, reminds me of

701
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,640
the one guy, I think he streamed a UFC thing, but framed it as if he was playing one of

702
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
the games.

703
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Oh yeah.

704
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
That was a news story a while ago.

705
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,320
I was said he was playing UFC, whatever on PlayStation four, but he was actually streaming

706
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,800
the live event and clever.

707
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,440
It's clever, highly illegal, but clever.

708
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
My space.

709
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,040
Tom's sold my space in 2005 for $580 million.

710
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,680
Oh my God.

711
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,040
Like, of course he's on a fucking desert island.

712
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Just like what, Oh my God, can you imagine $580 million?

713
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,240
That's winning the power ball basically.

714
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
Yeah.

715
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Mostly.

716
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Mostly.

717
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
I shouldn't laugh at that.

718
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
It's horrible.

719
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
Brad fits.

720
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Isn't rolling in it.

721
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
The, the founder of life.

722
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,040
Oh, the founder of live journal.

723
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:56,200
Well, you know, I mean he works at Google now, so he is, but, uh, let's see a rama and

724
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,800
chat over at live.vognetwork.com says after being in the social network, Justin Timberlake

725
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,480
bought my space from Fox interactive.

726
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,280
Oh, that's right.

727
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Cause they sold my space.

728
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
Yeah.

729
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Okay.

730
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
So I mean it was the whole music thing.

731
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Yeah.

732
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
And then they tried to turn my space in the music thing, but I don't think it really worked.

733
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,480
I think it's still there, but it's kind of not, it is not what it was.

734
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Yeah.

735
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,880
It's, it's the source of blackmail photos for everyone.

736
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,960
Oh, right.

737
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,080
Get in there and delete your my spaces.

738
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,480
If you ever had a my space account, I, you better get in there and delete it or those

739
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,840
old pictures are going to come back to haunt your ass.

740
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,720
Thankfully I never posted anything questionable.

741
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,360
Well even like, did you ever post silly things?

742
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Nope.

743
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,920
Well then that's good for you.

744
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,800
I deactivated mine a long time ago, but actually there's a part of me that's kind of sad.

745
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Like I wish I would have downloaded a backup first because you know, that's open.

746
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,400
Like that was like when everybody was going digital for the first time.

747
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,360
So I was like, I've lost this whole series of pictures from a time in my life because

748
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,420
I, I nuked my space.

749
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:59,240
So that's why I'm glad not everything is on Facebook, that it's like backed up on my phone

750
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,440
and I do back up my phone to my computer once in a while and pull all the pictures down.

751
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,800
So that's the nice thing.

752
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
I don't want to have it all online.

753
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
All right.

754
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,320
Anyway, we have digressed enough from the topic of my space and discord of Microsoft

755
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
and discord.

756
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
Does my space have a discord?

757
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,600
You think maybe here's the top eight channels.

758
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,200
All right, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

759
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,720
been playing this week.

760
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,840
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

761
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,440
It was non-existent.

762
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,680
I haven't touched animal crossing in about a week and a half now.

763
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,480
I also have only played a little bit of Pokemon.

764
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,360
I have only played a little bit of Miitomo because I want to just see it through to

765
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,960
its bitter end.

766
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:48,960
And really it's mostly been watching Dan play, uh, you know, go Korok hunting in a Breath

767
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,320
of the Wild.

768
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,640
And then, yeah, not, not a whole bunch.

769
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,620
Just I've got drag con that I'm getting ready for.

770
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:01,320
So that's really been the, uh, the extent of it.

771
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
Sorry.

772
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,040
All good.

773
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
It happens.

774
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,360
Uh, Loki, I'm sure you've had a busy gaming week with the new console.

775
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,360
Yeah, I did.

776
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,200
I, so now of course, since I got the switch, I've been playing tons of Mario Odyssey.

777
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,240
Um, so I haven't gotten that far in the game yet.

778
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,760
My son already beat the game, but he's not collecting everything.

779
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,440
So I'm up to the Lake Kingdom.

780
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:31,100
I did the tree kingdom and so now just started that and I've got like 72 of the moons already

781
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,700
and yeah, I have got Mario Kart 8 as well, but I haven't actually put that into the system

782
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,740
yet and I'm looking at probably getting more games for it.

783
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,060
I just haven't decided what yet.

784
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:47,780
Minecraft probably, um, and then maybe some more multiplayer stuff.

785
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:54,700
I kept looking at Labo and I kept going over and like, cause I saw it everywhere, you know,

786
00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:00,000
this weekend I was like, eh, I picked it up, but all I can think of after looking at my

787
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,840
house and how destroyed it is with the kids crap everywhere, that stuff would just be

788
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,600
all over the goddamn house and destroyed.

789
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,160
So I just, I can't, I cannot buy Labo.

790
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:18,960
It looks neat, but that they're going to get bored with that so quick that it's not worth

791
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,960
it.

792
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
It's just not worth it at all.

793
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,600
So I mean as much fun as it would be to make a piano, I think I'd just be bored with it

794
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
immediately.

795
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:34,200
So not for me, um, but then aside from the Switch stuff, I did play a ton of Pokemon

796
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,720
Go just because I've been in a lot of places that had Poke stops and stuff.

797
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:45,200
Um, I think, I think it was kind of ironic that, um, one of the first last like research

798
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,800
I had to do was catch three insect type Pokemon and all of a sudden there's no insect type

799
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Pokemon anywhere.

800
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,040
It's like, it's like Paris a lot.

801
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,240
Paris is, I don't know about your neck of the woods, but Paris is herpes around here.

802
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,160
It is everywhere and unstoppable.

803
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,840
But then when they do a special event, Paris is nowhere to be found.

804
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,480
Yeah, it's, it's just, it's, and Venonat is the other one.

805
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,680
Venonat is, is everywhere.

806
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,000
And then when special event rolls in, it's like all the special stuff takes the Venonat

807
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,820
and uh, Paris spawns.

808
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,120
It was nice to be able to get some Wailmers cause I hadn't gotten any of those.

809
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,080
So I got some of those and I've been catching Magikarp and stuff.

810
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:25,000
I just been just catching as much as I can and just trying to do the daily things.

811
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,840
But I've not been like killing myself if I don't get like certain things or whatever.

812
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,840
Um, I don't know.

813
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
It's just a good time killer.

814
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,120
Like my kids are at the park today and so I did that cause the park that we're at had

815
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,560
like three or four Pokestops.

816
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,440
So I just kept walking between them to like, uh, stash up, you know, on the, you know,

817
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,440
more items.

818
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,880
Did you get to a high enough level in Ingress where you can send more, um, Pokestops?

819
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,520
I think it's 10.

820
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,640
Yeah, I'm like 13.

821
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
Oh shoot.

822
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
Yeah.

823
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,640
Then you can also review.

824
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,640
I mean, I don't, I'm sure.

825
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
I did review some.

826
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,640
Yeah.

827
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,640
Just for fun.

828
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
I just got bored.

829
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
Yeah.

830
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
I hear you.

831
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
But um, yeah, you can submit too.

832
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,640
Why not?

833
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,640
Yeah, I guess I could.

834
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,640
Um, so I may do that.

835
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,640
Who knows?

836
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,520
Um, then I was, other than that, I mean, that's pretty much it.

837
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,840
It was just mainly just phone games and the switch and now that I have the switch and

838
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,840
I'm this close to get in the Skyrim again.

839
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,560
I don't want to, I don't want to buy Skyrim again.

840
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
I'm this close though.

841
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
It's tempted.

842
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,440
They're very tempting, but I may just stick with my PC.

843
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,160
I may end up getting on VR though cause that might be fun.

844
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:35,280
Um, I think better than the switch, but yeah, I mean, I've kind of like looked at the stuff

845
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,280
online.

846
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,160
Um, some of the games are looking at like golf story might be really good.

847
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,160
I hear that's a pretty fun RPG, so I may try that.

848
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,280
Um, blaster masters looks pretty awesome.

849
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,880
Oh, definitely get blast master.

850
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
That's a good deal.

851
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
So I may do that.

852
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,080
Um, but like, it's kind of like, I've been hard trying to figure out what I want to purchase

853
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,720
on the switch and like even like the Nintendo stuff, it's like, eh, I don't really want

854
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,720
that.

855
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,960
I mean, I'm, I guess I'll have to wait until E3 this year to see what else they're going

856
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,960
to come out with.

857
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,000
I hope they bring back Mario maker cause that's one I am really sad that I had to let go of

858
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,560
because of this, but in the end of the thing I told my son too, cause I backed the ball

859
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,360
with the saves before that.

860
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,560
My PC runs a fucking Wii U emulator like a bomb, so I don't, it's not a big deal that

861
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,800
we're losing some of those Wii U games, so I'll just play it on there.

862
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,120
I think Mario maker would be a good one to come back to, but they did put it on 3DS that

863
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,480
might've been there.

864
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
I know, I know.

865
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
It's not the same thing.

866
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
It's not the same thing.

867
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
It's not.

868
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,880
And they like took out something really add anything so I can see them bringing it back

869
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,640
as like a remaster of a game and maybe putting another Mario set in there.

870
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,020
Maybe they do Mario two level Mario two game boy.

871
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,240
Mario two played so different from the other Mario's because it wasn't originally a Mario

872
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
game.

873
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,040
So maybe Mario land.

874
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,720
Well I would say another graphic skin they could do easy would be Mario all stars.

875
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
That was missing.

876
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,040
I think Mario all stars would be like an extra bonus skin they could put in there and that

877
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,040
would work really well.

878
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,920
Did they add any Odyssey stuff in yet?

879
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,520
But Odyssey is 3D so it doesn't really work.

880
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,880
Well I don't think they would do it, but we need for a 3D Mario maker do Odyssey Galaxy

881
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
64.

882
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,880
Sunshine.

883
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,120
I would be that might be a bit much but yeah I mean I'd be for it if they if Nintendo can

884
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
pull it off in a Nintendo way.

885
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,640
I mean someone's pulled it off on an emulator for the 64.

886
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,640
I think a Mario maker with the bonus all stars skin would be a smart thing to do.

887
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,520
Mario two like again I'm all for it like in theory it would be awesome and if Nintendo

888
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,200
can kind of figure out how to incorporate that Mario maker but I almost feel like that

889
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,600
would have to be a separate thing because Mario two is not the same game as the others.

890
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Or just bring some.

891
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Although it would be sorry it would be badass if you could like I do think about NES remix

892
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,860
like you know those games and it had these random ass stages where you could play as

893
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,560
the princess in Super Mario Brothers 3.

894
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,080
Like that was some of the weird shit it did.

895
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,160
So actually it would be really rad and I think would justify a re-release of Mario maker

896
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,920
if they did a Super Mario maker with Mario two Mario all stars and you can play as Luigi

897
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,760
Toad and Princess.

898
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
That would be right.

899
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
Wouldn't that be awesome.

900
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,240
But and then people would really have to think about some of the levels and the fact that

901
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,940
you know Toad and Princess and Luigi and some of the things they could do would be different.

902
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,940
So I don't know.

903
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,240
There's a lot to do with it.

904
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,680
Yeah there's a lot you could do with it.

905
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,080
So OK J.D. how was your gaming week.

906
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
It was good.

907
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,080
Yeah.

908
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,160
I've been also playing Odyssey.

909
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,000
I've beaten the game already.

910
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,760
So but they put in a lot of updates recently.

911
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,080
Like they introduced I mean this is in the past couple of months but I haven't really

912
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,080
picked it up until now.

913
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:52,000
They put in a Luigi balloon mode where it's hide and seek with balloons and that's been

914
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,160
a lot of fun.

915
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,900
And it's a huge coin maker like I will never need to grind for coins again with this mode.

916
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,540
So they put in a bunch of new costumes to buy.

917
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:11,540
So I've been playing dress up and I finally went through the stupid volleyball moon where

918
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,940
you have to like hit it a hundred times.

919
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,940
I've also been playing Splatoon within the single player mode mostly Splatoon 2.

920
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,940
Splatoon 2.

921
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,940
Yeah.

922
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,940
Sorry I don't have the first one.

923
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,940
Yeah.

924
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,540
The single player mode has like a bunch of collectibles so that's what I've been doing.

925
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:34,140
And they recently like in the past week put Callie in if you've beaten the game.

926
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,160
So I wanted to see what that was about.

927
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,900
I've also been buying a bunch of 3DS games when they go on sale on my Nintendo.

928
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,320
It's like 30% off and you know it's a digital copy so I'm on board with that.

929
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:53,660
So I've recently gone most of the way through Paper Mario Sticker Star which I have feelings

930
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,660
about.

931
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,660
And then.

932
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,260
Just wait a minute elaborate on this please.

933
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:06,260
I mean the Paper Mario series is pretty inconsistent like it's the first two games were fantastic

934
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,740
and then the Wii one was a bit of a departure and I feel like it's kind of deteriorated

935
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,740
from there.

936
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,740
I love the Wii one.

937
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,480
I mean that's the only one I played so I don't know.

938
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,640
It's different like the first two are much more like standard RPGs and the Wii one was

939
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,820
like a hybrid platformer RPG.

940
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:29,640
And then Sticker Star like is just a like it's kind of a weird like run around adventure

941
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,780
kind of a thing.

942
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:36,160
And the thing that really bothers me the most is that you in order to attack you have to

943
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,460
use stickers which are consumable and I'm the kind of gamer who hoards everything because

944
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,700
I might need it someday.

945
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,780
And I have all these I have hundreds of potions in Skyrim and I may need them at some point.

946
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,780
Right.

947
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,620
The inventory management was really difficult because you can only hold so many and then

948
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:01,360
it's like well OK I might need this because I only have so many jumps but there's this

949
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,980
really big one that's powerful that I want to hang on to because I just found it and

950
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,700
if I don't make room for it I'll lose it.

951
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,060
But then I have to get rid of the attacks that I'm using because you can't do anything

952
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,860
without a sticker like that whole mechanic really did not work for me.

953
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:21,220
And then I've been playing Animal Crossing Pocket Camp and Pokemon Go.

954
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:27,740
Animal Crossing they put in loot boxes that are cutesy fortune cookies and like literally

955
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:32,620
everybody I've read anything about like on Reddit or whatever is upset about it because

956
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:39,060
they cost a pretty significant amount of real world money to get for the most part and you're

957
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,940
not guaranteed uniques.

958
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:46,740
So like I think the stats someone posted said if you were to buy enough fortune cookies

959
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:51,740
to get one of each item if you had perfect luck it would be like $20.

960
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,380
Wait the only person I always defer to Jamie when it comes to Animal Crossing is this kind

961
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,380
of why I stopped playing.

962
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,380
Oh yeah.

963
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,340
Oh so this you are not you're not a fan of this either.

964
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,340
No.

965
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,620
So it has taken the fun out of it for me.

966
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,620
Yikes.

967
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,620
Yikes Nintendo.

968
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:08,940
A lot of Animal Crossing players like to complete the catalog because that's you know all the

969
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:14,220
items you know it's fashion it's whatever and fortune cookie items the paid ones or

970
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:19,440
I mean you can do it with in game currency sort of a little bit but not like all of it.

971
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,420
Those also go in the same catalog.

972
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:26,760
So it's like well you have to either be OK with an incomplete list of everything or pay

973
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,660
real world money and it's gambling because you don't know are you going to get the rare

974
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:36,340
or are you going to get the stupid two star item that you've got four times already.

975
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:40,420
Yeah there's there's a lot of content that they put in that's been locked behind.

976
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,980
Not only is it paid but it's limited time.

977
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:47,660
Like they put in a fortune cookie that's like here's a bunch of game consoles that

978
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,380
you can get for your house or for your campsite.

979
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,140
But this is only here for two weeks.

980
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,900
Like it's it's yeah it's frustrating.

981
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,900
OK.

982
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,980
All right.

983
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,300
Well we're going to move on to me and my gaming week.

984
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,100
My gaming week was kind of a potpourri of a lot of different type of stuff.

985
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:11,420
I've randomly got back into Diablo 3 it's like Diablo is one of those it's one of those

986
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,420
old flings.

987
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,140
You just kind of end up going back to once in a while and they ever going to bring that

988
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:21,380
to the switch because you know those are those rumors I know we talked we talked about previously

989
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,780
I'll be a very interesting sort of like the most land Diablo experience would be if they

990
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,900
brought it to switch and everybody could play Diablo on their own screens or gauntlet.

991
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:34,260
I'll play gauntlet on multiplayer like gauntlet would be a lot more possible because they

992
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,060
did have that gauntlet remake a couple of years ago that was on PlayStation 4 and Steam

993
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,060
and all that.

994
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,940
So there's no reason they couldn't put that on switch if they wanted to.

995
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:46,180
I don't know if they're still you know supporting gauntlet but anyway.

996
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:53,620
So I was playing I was playing that and kind of got sucked back into the season play season

997
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:57,300
13 right now so I've been working on that I'm almost to level 70 I have a little more

998
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,300
ways to go.

999
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,500
So I've been doing that on PC.

1000
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,020
Also been playing Overwatch continuing to do that especially since they still have that

1001
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,260
special event going on.

1002
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,940
I still have yet to get a skin for that oh wait no I take it back I got a Reinhardt skin

1003
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:14,340
great a character I never pick in a quick play I got a skin for them oh well.

1004
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:20,620
All I wanted was the Kris Jenner Sombra skin that's all I wanted and instead you got Alexis

1005
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,020
Michelle basically.

1006
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:29,300
So anyway I've been playing a little bit of Overwatch and I've actually not been playing

1007
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:33,020
as much Final Fantasy 14 lately I'm kind of waiting for the next content patch and that

1008
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,900
I'll log in to keep my house and my account active but that's about it.

1009
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,460
And then randomly I was on Xbox One playing some stuff on there so I talked about Gianna

1010
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,820
Sisters earlier and since you were visiting this weekend I was like let's look at some

1011
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:48,540
of the backwards compatible stuff you had never seen Beaten Groovy before and I was

1012
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:53,540
like let me show you how Konami shot themselves in the foot when they tried to launch Papa

1013
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:58,020
Music here in the US and so we played Beaten Groovy which I still to this day I don't know

1014
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:03,460
why anybody wasted a second of time trying to make that game backwards compatible I mean

1015
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,260
I guess making something else backwards compatible made that backwards compatible so I was like

1016
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:13,580
hey bonus but that game is a waste of everything so but I had to show you what an abomination

1017
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,860
was so we got to see that that was fun right you know they have a popin music game on the

1018
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:22,500
Wii too I know I never played it yeah I didn't either is it yeah I was like is it interesting

1019
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:28,580
I tell you what my Wii is homebrew enabled so I might at some point when I'm bored just

1020
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:35,900
like download it and try it there you go and then um let's see uh also I've still been

1021
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:41,620
playing Minecraft what the heck I'm still playing Minecraft I um I was playing a little

1022
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:47,420
bit more on that so after last you need to tell me when after last week's show we went

1023
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:52,540
on to twitch and I did a world called Miss Vanjie that but it was like spelled in all

1024
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:56,040
caps this time so I got a different world and we're actually doing a little bit of multiplayer

1025
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,640
and I still kind of went on in that world but I got really frustrated that I could not for the

1026
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:06,280
life of me find any iron like just freaking iron I was like not finding so finally I decided to

1027
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:12,480
give up on Miss Vanjie and on the I think it was Thursday night I rolled a new world because I

1028
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,520
wanted to see what it looked like if you let the chest and the village start in the game because I

1029
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:22,520
hadn't seen any of that so I started a new world called proportion izing it was my seed do you like

1030
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,000
that I like that one I did and some some of you out there will get the reference some work but

1031
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,280
some won't but I started a new world called proportion izing and it's actually probably my

1032
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,600
favorite seed I've done yet so there is that it's all in lowercase proportion izing and I was able

1033
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,080
to quickly build a little shelter in the side of the mountain and then there's a little village

1034
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,600
that's like right there and so I kind of got to see that village mechanic but damn they want a lot

1035
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,960
of shit to give you an emerald oh my god they weren't like the one guy wants like 25 pieces

1036
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,280
of paper for one emerald and I'm like where's sugar cane around here it's fine emeralds yeah

1037
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:02,640
where do you find it Oh emeralds are in the care in their abandoned mine shafts do you yell Eureka

1038
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:12,480
when you find something I do I do and and there are is plenty of iron that was the I started not

1039
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,840
far from this gigantic cave entrance and it was like one of those were like the underground was

1040
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,320
already like really opened up and there's all these places to go in the underground and so

1041
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,800
I was finding hella iron in there so I was able to make myself a full suit of armor pretty quick

1042
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,920
so yeah I was pretty happy with that anyway minecraft minecraft minecraft but like I'm

1043
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:36,480
actually into minecraft but I'm gonna kind of dial it back a bit because I'm waiting for mr.

1044
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:43,880
black wolf to be available again so we can start our official vog realm so we can invite switch

1045
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:51,440
players Xbox players and PC players to all play together on the vog realm which we will see what

1046
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:58,080
drag race word of the will be available technically Android and iOS players oh yeah Android iOS

1047
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:03,960
players so yeah everybody will be able to play on that realm so I'll be fun as 200 Matt says I need

1048
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,840
to get back into minecraft yeah it's fun it's fun but I'm having a hard time kind of breaking like

1049
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,680
past that first phase of the game when you're collecting iron when you start have to like

1050
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,240
really start collecting the other stuff for like redstone like you know you need redstone to be able

1051
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,960
to make a compass and all that other stuff you know when you can kind of really start to go into

1052
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:25,440
the next phase of the game but yeah just dig on down I know you gotta keep keep digging down keep

1053
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,040
digging how do you know you've hit the bottom in minecraft do you hit is it all lava at the bottom

1054
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:36,000
it's bedrock you won't be able to go any further okay okay and you see like this like weird black

1055
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,040
fog type stuff oh interesting okay well I'll so I have yet to hit absolute rock bottom it's like

1056
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:49,760
I don't remember like the exact depth I know like I remember his many down as it is up it's like 64

1057
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:57,640
down and 64 oh it's more than that is there than 128 down 128 up maybe yeah it's got to be some

1058
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:03,440
power of two otherwise you're talking 256 down that's that's I think it might be 256 is it really

1059
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,960
I don't know I can look it up I'm sure it's on the way you've done that thing where you find the

1060
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:13,640
edge of the world and everything goes crazy I play on the worlds that keep like they go forever

1061
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:19,000
yeah that you can't find the edge ever I just remember that being a thing once yeah I know

1062
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,440
well especially because I guess they split so now you just have minecraft which are all the

1063
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,800
connected versions are just minecraft you have minecraft PlayStation 4 Edition because it's not

1064
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:33,720
connected to the others you have minecraft Java Edition which is the old-school minecraft where

1065
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:38,120
you still have to like craft everything by hand and stuff and that has probably what you're talking

1066
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:44,120
about yeah yeah so but I like I like Windows 10 minecraft a lot and I'm really excited for when

1067
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,320
they do the super duper graphics 4k thing that's gonna be I know 4k minecraft I'm so excited but

1068
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,560
the weather effects are what I'm really looking forward to I think they'll look really cool yeah

1069
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:58,520
all right anyway that's enough for my gaming week so I'm gonna quickly say that you can follow us on

1070
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:04,080
Twitter at twitter.com slash olr we're also on Facebook at orange lounge radio and that's really

1071
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:09,680
all I have to announce tonight not a lot of announcements we I'm considering taking the

1072
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:15,000
show off when she goes to drag con so that's gonna be in two weeks but I'll have a final call on that

1073
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,400
next week because it looks like I'm gonna be in San Francisco that weekend hanging with JD because

1074
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,960
that's Eurovision weekend apparently is the same weekend is so I may just end up staying in San

1075
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:31,000
Francisco so later the total height of the map is 256 okay so 128 up 128 but the highest they

1076
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,800
basically the way they say is the highest sea level or sea water levels give me 62 so you think

1077
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:44,280
it's not quite even it's not even so like you're probably looking at 180 something down got it okay

1078
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:50,360
I see so it's not it's not evil and they have four layers of bedrock too so okay got it why

1079
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:55,480
do they have four layers of bedrock if because it's a seed and so it's just kind of scattered

1080
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:03,080
around so you don't fall through it okay interesting okay all right well we're going to

1081
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:09,080
move on to some news and the news this week and of course again if you're listening live you can

1082
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:14,880
always join us at live.vognetwork.com I want to say I was looking at chat cuz there's a really

1083
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,400
funny comment I read earlier that I wanted to read oh here it is I I missed this comment earlier I

1084
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,380
want to read it now MXC in our chat room said my gaming week was non-existent because Rob named

1085
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:31,600
drop the soap opera passions last week so my time was spent binging that goddamn show you're welcome

1086
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:37,080
and tell me tell me you don't love Tabitha and Timmy but try not to be sad because Timmy actually

1087
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:42,680
like passed away halfway through the making of that show and I think they replaced Timmy with a

1088
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:47,840
female doll at some point I don't remember I need to go back and binge the show myself to remember

1089
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:58,920
so or to quote the wonderful show dinosaurs uh-huh we're gonna need new Timmy all right news let's

1090
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,920
get into some gaming news Loki all right so Nintendo is getting a new president so basically

1091
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:15,960
the previous president which was Tatsumi can we have Nintendo influence America I couldn't resist

1092
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:22,840
sorry please continue Tatsumi Kimishima it basically is gonna step down and replacing them

1093
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:32,640
is gonna be Shintaro Furukawa and I guess he joined the company in 1994 where he was he's

1094
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:39,120
been an outside director of the Pokemon company since 2012 and then a managing executive officer

1095
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:44,800
and then supervisor of corporate analysis and administration division and director of Nintendo

1096
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:54,200
since 2016 so doesn't really say anything's gonna really change from that but I guess well they're

1097
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,240
not gonna okay they're not gonna be like we changed our president and the whole get a hold

1098
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,400
on your butts because everything is gonna fucking change not everything's gonna change I know like

1099
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:08,880
when we had like our company had president changes or CEO changes you know that basically it's not

1100
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,080
necessarily the direction but like kind of their focus may have changed like they might be one in

1101
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:19,320
the focus more on like one aspect of the company or one direction versus another so you may have

1102
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:26,400
like a difference in like kind of where they want to use where they want the company to go and well

1103
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,080
what's also interesting is that this this new president what was his name again I'm it's gonna

1104
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,520
take some getting used to free kumashima oh kimishim is that no kimishim is the no it's a

1105
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:42,400
Furukawa Furukawa yeah Furukawa is the new president he's only like 45 years old right

1106
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:49,120
yeah it's 46 years old 46 years old okay so he's seven years older than me so he grew up on the

1107
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,680
Nintendo he grew up in a world where Nintendo was already I couldn't think of a more perfect person

1108
00:54:53,680 --> 00:55:01,040
for that yeah right um and well I mean what I'm assuming is by going with somebody who is a little

1109
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:06,360
more younger you know not that I am for age discrimination but when a wada took over Nintendo

1110
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:11,120
he was a younger guy too if I remember right and he really became kind of the face of Nintendo I

1111
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:16,000
mean obviously you know Miyamoto just you know I would hope with like someone that is a bit younger

1112
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,800
like that would be a little bit more tech savvy and so we don't have any of these scenarios where

1113
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:26,200
it's like we don't know what Xbox Live is like and so you know like I think they have like this

1114
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:30,320
is years ago that we talked about this like where they didn't even it seemed like they didn't know

1115
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:35,440
what their competition was doing in the realm of like network at least he doesn't look as scary as

1116
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,560
Yamauchi did cuz I always thought that he looked like he was former Yakuza or something I know

1117
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:44,480
every time we would watch like Dan and I would watch a Nintendo documentary we would just say

1118
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,560
it's Yamauchi of the Yamauchi gumi hmm so well and I think a lot of people are wondering like did

1119
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:57,400
did Kimishima do something wrong or was were they unhappy with him he wants a younger guy well I

1120
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,960
think that was what he said right well it's part that but I think the other thing to remember is

1121
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:07,200
that I do recall when they put Kimishima and they were like this is this was always temporary yeah

1122
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:13,160
and basically you know it wasn't that he wasn't doing well it was just basically said that Kimishima

1123
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:18,240
thought that Nintendo's management needed to be younger to better understand its customers thank

1124
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,440
you thank you well in Kimishima I mean you know here's the thing I'm not gonna knock him at all

1125
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:29,720
because he he did exactly what he needed to do he carried out a wata's vision he was a financial

1126
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,240
guy and you can say that you can certainly say Nintendo is in a great fucking place financially

1127
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:39,600
now the switch has done very well you know and all this stuff so I know Kimishima has done what

1128
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:45,920
he went there to do so I think he's been the guy that kind of his role was to fully carry out what

1129
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:52,120
a wata was working on now you're gonna have this new guy come in that's gonna be okay what's the

1130
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:57,160
next Nintendo system what's the next direction for Nintendo and I think that's what this new

1131
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,840
guy is gonna be coming in to do in part not to say that Nintendo probably doesn't already have

1132
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:07,200
a plan in place for the next few years and maybe even has an idea of what their next system is but

1133
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,840
I think this is going to be the guy that then carries that next system out and I think it's

1134
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:16,480
probably gonna be more of a face of the company like Kimishima he never showed up in Nintendo

1135
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:22,520
Directs no he didn't do any of the the shows or anything they always sent Reggie to any of the

1136
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:27,120
American talk shows maybe Miyamoto with his that infamous thumbs up thumbs down thing from the

1137
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:31,360
Tonight Show and all that but for the most part you know those are the guys making all the public

1138
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:37,680
appearances so I'm imagining because this guy is younger he and maybe just his attitude I mean we

1139
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,480
haven't really seen this guy yet maybe he is going to be more of the guy you're gonna see and be like

1140
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,760
that face of Nintendo now and that I'm assuming that's kind of why they're doing this transition

1141
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:54,720
now so my assumption is that e3 is going to be this guy's big unveiling he you because the

1142
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,680
transition doesn't happen till the end of May right it doesn't actually become effective till

1143
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:06,080
then or mid-may or something that probably yeah so e3 is going to be the official unveiling of

1144
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,920
this new CEO and that's when you're gonna really get to meet him and know his personality I think

1145
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,440
a little bit in the Nintendo Direct at least that's my said summer so I don't know okay when

1146
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:21,040
that's one they're determining summer is gonna be okay all right fair enough fair enough so yeah so

1147
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,400
again I it's kind of one of those things where it's like oh shoot Nintendo got a new president

1148
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:30,040
like I wasn't expecting that but it's like oh wait a minute but you know Kimishima was supposed

1149
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,920
to be a temporary guy he wasn't you know he was only gonna be there to really finish off what a

1150
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,280
wata had started and and now we're starting to see really okay now what is the future

1151
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:47,040
Nintendo look like so very interested to see what this guy does no pressure right right maybe hope

1152
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:53,160
a virtual console on maybe you maybe he will if he you know what if he grew up on Famicom games

1153
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:58,920
then maybe he's gonna say I want to play those games again we need to figure out a way to make

1154
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,840
those games back out there I wouldn't be surprised if he had gaming watches when he was a kid you

1155
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:07,400
know for the market they were intended for course of course now is the right type of nostalgia to

1156
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:14,200
cash in on well and and is it going to be another classic NES I mean because there's no reason why

1157
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:19,280
Nintendo could not wouldn't do like a classic NES too and it could take you know what they could

1158
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,920
absolutely do a classic NES too and it's shaped like the new Nintendo's that hardly anybody had

1159
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,440
the top loaders you know what I mean so there's no reason they couldn't do another one of those

1160
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,720
I still wanted to get one of the Famicom style ones oh one of the classic Famicoms yeah except

1161
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,760
the thing that I always hated about the Famicom is that the controllers are attached and really

1162
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:45,680
short hmm all right well let's move on to other Microsoft news and Jason alluded to this in the

1163
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:52,240
intro and I find this very fascinating there's a new April Xbox update and it started coming out

1164
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,480
you're starting to see that on the Xbox one and there's a lot of new stuff with it including

1165
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,280
advanced video modes that will allow you to smooth out displays club and community tournament

1166
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,840
improvements and this is pretty big deal you can share your controller with one of your viewers on

1167
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:13,160
mixer so whereas the PlayStation has share play which is more of a private thing right you kind

1168
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,880
of streamed one of your friends and they can take your controller mixer is gonna allow you to do

1169
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:22,200
this with your viewers you know and mixer again if you didn't already know is Microsoft's kind of

1170
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:27,880
competitor for twitch and it's interesting to see you know they're really trying to think of some

1171
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,600
different ideas than which twitch is provided so this is this is very different and I think you

1172
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:37,120
would crack the joke before the show before we went online you could give your controller over

1173
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:41,240
to somebody on mixer and then that person could go in and delete all your save files I don't think

1174
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:45,400
that's gonna be how it works I know well you and I imagine you can take the controller back in a

1175
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:51,720
heartbeat if if somebody's fucking around or whatever with this will be low latency mode so

1176
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:56,800
if the TV has a low latency or game mode your Xbox is gonna be able to communicate you're playing a

1177
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:02,640
game to the device and switch the mode automatically so it's gonna tell your TV to switch future is now

1178
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:11,840
that's right also adding support for 2560 by 1440 that's kind of neat to variable refresh rate start

1179
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:16,920
the mixer broadcast anywhere on Xbox one and a pause animation if you switch games or go to the

1180
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,080
dashboard you can share screenshots directly to Twitter now which I think PlayStation 4 is let

1181
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:26,040
you've done that do that for a while but Xbox will have you do that light and dark themes for

1182
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:31,040
everybody a high contrast theme probably for those that need a little help with the site things

1183
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:37,240
improvements to Xbox narrator again great accessibility changes their balance in game

1184
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:43,280
audio and streamed music spatial audio on the Xbox one dashboard an updated edge browser woohoo

1185
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,720
anyone can create community tournaments new filters to club feeds club admins can filter

1186
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:54,240
invitation requests and experimental new features oh I like a system that experiments but that's

1187
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,840
everything to look forward to in the April update so what do you guys think controller sharing on

1188
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:04,000
mixer is this a good thing or is this a waste of time on Microsoft to put this in I think it's a

1189
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,760
waste of time I just don't know yet how that's gonna be utilized and I guess we'll have to see

1190
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,840
when people are streaming how they utilize that hey play my game while I pee yeah play my game

1191
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:18,280
while I pee pretty much I wonder if they're gonna try to do like twitch plays Pokemon style stuff

1192
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:23,400
like because mixer is their streaming thing and like twitch plays Pokemon was probably one of the

1193
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,200
first times I heard twitch being like a big name so maybe they're trying to go for something like

1194
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:35,440
plays pub G can you imagine a thing though we're like mixer plays Pokemon well yeah it'll probably

1195
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,600
be a Microsoft game but racer plays halo or something where each person can control for

1196
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:47,080
one second yeah I mean like maybe that's the kind of like creative stuff they're trying to win you

1197
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:52,600
know get on board with who knows guys you don't chat says PlayStation 4 been doing share play out

1198
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,560
the box I don't think that was out the box the streaming was out of the box on the PlayStation

1199
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:01,440
4 but I don't think share play came in till later yeah that wasn't until later where you

1200
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,000
could share your controller with somebody else I didn't come in till later but but the difference

1201
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,560
here is on PlayStation 4 it's private on mixer it's gonna be public right I think it's for

1202
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:17,000
different intents so I don't know if it's gonna be the same right yeah just let me like hey you

1203
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,240
want to try this game or want play co-op with me but you could and share please share please

1204
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:27,000
though it's not so that's why I'm kind of confused on this so like is this where like I can start a

1205
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,280
game say of halo death match or something like that and I could have three other people join

1206
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,640
like to play local play type thing like they're like remotely controlling player two three and

1207
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:40,360
four or is this gonna be like hey I'm playing halo you take over the controls for me and I'm

1208
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:45,600
like hands off and I'm just gonna commentate on you playing this or something either or would be

1209
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:50,260
if it's like share play it would be either or so but the other thing would be that they'd have to

1210
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:55,080
kind of have the load that they'd have to have really good latency but I think mixer already

1211
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:01,360
has like super low latency because mixer is kind of the way twitch used to be before twitch got

1212
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,560
really big remember how like it was almost instantaneous on twitch previously and now

1213
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:10,920
there's like what a 25 second delay or something on twitch whereas on mixer I think it's much lower

1214
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:15,360
so maybe you know cuz it isn't gonna be hard to play a platforming game or something if it's not

1215
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:20,920
like instantaneous the nice thing about share play is it does feel really good like it's not like I

1216
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:25,720
wouldn't play a music game or anything on it but playing like other like playing like monster

1217
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:30,880
hunter or something like you it does feel normal like you're playing a normal game instantaneous

1218
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,160
you're gonna have people stream sniping these guys but I mean well I don't think you're just gonna be

1219
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,920
able to like you're gonna have to give permission for somebody to take controls well right what I'm

1220
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:44,520
saying is though is if it's instantaneous in order for it to be able to handle something like this

1221
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:49,680
people are gonna be able to watch people play PUBG yeah and they can stream snipe them because

1222
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,480
there's no delay well you could do that now anyway no you can't because there's a delay in playing

1223
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,520
the game there's like a 25 second delay you said no mixer doesn't have that delay and the mixers

1224
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:04,200
never had that delay oh it's it's much shorter but it's gonna have to get even shorter you know

1225
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:10,560
I mean right anyway I'm excited to see what this is and I like that mixer is doing these sorts of

1226
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:15,520
things to really try to differentiate themselves from twitch like it does kind of make me go I

1227
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:22,360
should be doing stuff more stuff with mixer but then I go but twitch will pay me so or at least I

1228
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:28,000
there is a money-making mechanism through twitch right now so you know there is there is that to

1229
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,760
consider and and I think if mixer could kind of figure that all out like I know you can become a

1230
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:39,920
mixer partner and stuff but you know it's it's not they need that more entry-level type of program I

1231
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:46,320
think to really have that take off it'll come in and if it doesn't then if this is popular then

1232
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:51,600
twitch will just copy it but twitch hasn't been copying what make sure does I would have thought

1233
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:57,520
for sure twitch would have jacked the multi stream thing by now but they haven't this is interesting

1234
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:04,000
all right maybe it's because in a lot of streams on mixer it's very messy and that's because you

1235
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,040
can do a multi stream of four people but the problem is all four people keep talking over

1236
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:13,560
each other like these people need to use like a unified chat environment or something where it

1237
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:17,840
would make the streams a lot cleaner if they did that's how they do it with awesome games done

1238
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:23,160
quick it's basically just you have audio from one whoever's in the lead that's the audio you hear

1239
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:29,680
yeah however they rotate it around yeah looking in chat at live dog network comms Kaijuto says

1240
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:35,720
twitch probably can't do it because they don't have the tech they're related to Amazon now don't

1241
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:40,640
forget they've got they've got plenty of tech let's see blueberry and chat says can Xbox now

1242
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:47,400
play local co-op online or only with gold oh that's a good question about would gold people

1243
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:53,120
only be able to use the mixer control we don't know that do we know if that's only available to

1244
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:57,720
gold or not good question because share play on PlayStation 4 you have to have PlayStation

1245
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:02,000
Plus to take the controller you don't have to have PlayStation Plus to watch but you have to

1246
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,920
have PlayStation Plus to take the controller so that's a very good question and I'm not sure one

1247
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:11,440
that has been answered yet so all right well let's move on with some other stories dark soccer what

1248
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:17,880
do you have for us oh in other news there are well you know hackers gonna hack and data miners

1249
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:25,800
gonna data mine so there are some new Super Mario Odyssey costumes coming out they the names were

1250
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:31,120
data mined in February but now the designs are released so we have a zombie outfit that's got

1251
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:38,000
Mario all green and happy and torn to bits with an axe in his head that's charming there's also I

1252
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:47,640
guess a looks like a 17th century or 18th century French nobleman outfit complete with wig there's

1253
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:53,040
an astronaut no maybe a racer it looks kind of like a race car driver yeah there's a Santa

1254
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:59,920
there's a weird Viking looking one I guess it's definitely race because it says Mario

1255
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:08,160
Motors on him there's also a little dress and dude I guess these are the Bowser marriage

1256
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:15,640
these are the brutal the brutal yeah yeah one of those has been officially released like there is

1257
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:19,800
a news piss on the switch channel and everything that's not the one that's in this picture though

1258
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:27,600
that's the one of the green one with a hat yeah this is like a pretty dress and a weird-looking

1259
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:38,480
courier typer or courtier type person and another one is a dude in a sombrero so that's all of the

1260
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:46,400
brutal that's cool if you like collecting the outfits I'm sure that Nintendo is just gonna

1261
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:50,520
gradually roll those out because they've been doing that for the past like a couple of months

1262
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,240
it just it keeps Odyssey kind of fresh in people's mind the zombie one is a little surprising I

1263
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,760
wouldn't be surprised if these are tied with holidays because you have the zombie one that

1264
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:03,840
could be Halloween you have one that looks like George Washington Independence Day and Santa

1265
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:13,160
Claus obviously that's gonna be st. Patrick's Day I mean so what about Hanukkah Mario Rob you know

1266
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:19,440
they always ignore us for any holidays I know but there's like maybe five Jews in Japan maybe

1267
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:24,000
toad is the Jewish one maybe maybe they're not there actually is a very large Jewish community

1268
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,920
in Japan oh I didn't because even though they were allied with the Nazis during World War two they

1269
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:37,400
did open their borders to Jewish refugees interesting history lesson there you go more than a bargain

1270
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:43,520
for on oil art but no it's pretty much just all of the commercial holidays okay fair enough

1271
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:49,360
race day I love race day I mean that's probably a Mario Kart tie-in they've been doing like the

1272
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:56,760
Satellaview costume and like other Nintendo wait which one's the dress oh okay yeah yeah the girl

1273
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:02,840
brutal yeah there's three names so for Mario's quinceañera I think the wedding dress would work

1274
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:08,920
for the quinceañera actually yeah it's honestly honestly like I I'm like when I hear these Mario

1275
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:13,840
costume stories I'm like okay cool me I'm never gonna change out of the wedding dress like the

1276
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,320
Mario on the wedding dress is the only way I can play Mario Odyssey because it's just it lends

1277
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,960
itself to non-stop amazing screenshots I like playing with different hats and the wedding

1278
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:27,280
dress because like the juxtaposition is crazy what you like to have a say-something hat I mean

1279
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:34,160
you know that I've seen it I like I like going into the 8-bit Mario whenever you go into those

1280
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:39,600
sections and seeing what the costume looks like mm-hmm that's always fun um for real though like

1281
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,800
I thought I was always gonna play with the wedding dress but then they released the sunshine outfit

1282
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:49,600
and I was like this is my aesthetic we're good okay fair enough all right I go to a chat over at

1283
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:56,440
live dot vog and network comm Raginator in chat says costumes as DLC and Mario Odyssey reminds

1284
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:01,120
me of little big planet on PlayStation 3 another game that had tons and tons of costumes were they

1285
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,440
it some you had to pay for some you didn't you would unlock as you play different levels it's

1286
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:09,760
kind of a mix-and-match there especially if it was licensed you probably had to pay for it like

1287
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:16,400
I remember having yes some of them you do they do those like it's like an actual like level pack

1288
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:21,240
like I remember Pirates of the Caribbean one I got I kind of miss a little big planet like I know

1289
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,800
that I know they did one on PlayStation 4 but it's been a few I'm ready for I'm ready for another

1290
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,840
little bit got it yeah we got it free not too long ago well you're not gonna get a little big player

1291
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,960
and get that was it dreams or whatever they call that now which is sort of like a little big plan

1292
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:36,120
but not sure they'll have a little big planet costumes in there cool I guess all of those

1293
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,320
costumes though have been free they aren't DLC in the fact that you have to buy them which makes

1294
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:46,240
me think maybe they're doing all of this build-up to announce like DLC 83 or something like I'd be

1295
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:50,160
so down for Mario Odyssey DLC I feel like they're not done with the game because they keep rolling

1296
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:55,960
out new things you know with as much crap as we give Nintendo and online they do DLC very fucking

1297
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:01,720
well like their DLC stuff that they do is like really robust yeah I've already bought the

1298
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:06,480
Splatoon DLC even though it's not even out yeah well sure but that's that's how they get you all

1299
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:12,880
right let's move on we have more new speaking of a time to announce things right Logie right so

1300
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:18,440
let's talk about III III is right around the corner just in June and we've already got the

1301
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:23,760
press conference schedule so starting things off everything is still kind of walking and taking

1302
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:30,480
place on the weekend before almost so Saturday you have EA which was June 9th at 11 p.m. Pacific

1303
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:37,480
time so they're gonna have their conference then month or on Sunday they're gonna have of course

1304
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:43,760
the Microsoft press event at 1 p.m. and then of course interrupting our show as they've done in

1305
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:50,320
the last few years we have Bethesda fault certainly are shortly after and I hear rumors at least I

1306
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:55,400
there was a rumored list of like some you know the Microsoft marketing rights for certain games

1307
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:01,960
and all their scroll six is on there and I'm like please so we'll see they're just gonna give us a

1308
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:07,880
name yeah it's not gonna come out for years but I they have to really scatter out now it's time

1309
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:13,840
for Elder Scrolls six no they need to release Skyrim on four more platforms nope six it's on

1310
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:19,480
all the platforms it's not mobile yet but it's not on 3ds scroll six would be this year uh-huh

1311
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:23,960
that's it you know what though we say like oh it wouldn't be for years but you know they've been

1312
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:28,120
working on it for a long time though I think and they don't tend to announce shit until like it's

1313
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:32,240
gonna come out that year like what do they have coming out this year I mean I don't really know

1314
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:37,720
what their lineup is at all everything that they've announced is already out I think maybe doom 2 I

1315
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:43,720
think would have been would be a logical choice like a doom 2 and perhaps I would have assumed

1316
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:49,840
like a Fallout New Vegas type type of there could be a new like a remaster of Fallout New Vegas or

1317
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:57,480
something like that maybe or just like a spin-off fallout with the Fallout 4 engine but I fuck if

1318
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:03,440
it's Elder Scrolls 6 this year sign me up like you are allowed to interrupt OLR to announce

1319
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:15,480
a new Elder Scrolls 6 anyways then on Monday of course we have Ubisoft at 1 p.m. Pacific and then

1320
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:22,800
following that Nintendo is gonna have their thing on Tuesday at starting at 9 now what exactly

1321
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,240
Nintendo's thing is gonna be well we've got a little bit more information regarding that so on

1322
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:33,000
June 11th they're gonna do a Splatoon 2 World Championship and that's gonna be from 3 30 p.m.

1323
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:40,280
to 6 p.m. Pacific time with the finals on the 12th they're gonna have their video presentation at 9

1324
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:48,040
a.m. on June 12th as well and of course they're gonna include Smash Brothers in that as you know

1325
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:52,760
on top of other announcements they're gonna do the Nintendo treehouse live for three days

1326
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:57,880
afterwards kind of similar to what they've done in the past and then Super Smash Brothers invitationals

1327
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:04,360
2018 which is gonna be on June 12th they didn't see though which version of the game that is I

1328
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:14,800
feel like it's got to be the Wii U one maybe who knows if the new one is an upgrade ish of the Wii

1329
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:20,440
U one then they could do the new one yeah you mean if it's an enhanced remake kind of if it's

1330
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:26,120
like I don't know it'll say Splatoon 2 to Splatoon 1 but some of the Splatoon players don't like that

1331
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:31,600
comparison but anyway yeah so at least that's what's coming and just right around the corner

1332
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:40,160
you'll not even like two months away in a month and a couple days I'm looking at chat over at

1333
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:46,120
live.vognetware.com sj100 Matt says Bethesda will probably announce at least another mobile game

1334
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:53,480
that will go live when the presentation is over that seems to be their deal okay they had the

1335
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:57,840
fallout shelter they had a trading card game yeah I think they've kind of done that before

1336
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,640
maybe it's got maybe a Skyrim an Elder Scrolls game that was a trading card game was Elder

1337
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:08,480
Scrolls well shit uh dungeon buster says Elder Scrolls online is getting another expansion this

1338
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:14,080
summer set in the Somerset region of Tamriel but I Elder Scrolls online I would think has kind of

1339
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:18,040
like their own dedicated team at this point and like what they're doing doesn't really influence

1340
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:23,800
the production yeah that that they that's already coming out so they may talk about a little bit

1341
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:31,160
saying hey this just came out but I don't think it's gonna be SSJ 100 Matt suggests Wolfenstein

1342
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:41,200
Nazi punching clicker game I'm in I'm in all right e3 look forward to it well this is a game

1343
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:45,560
I know you're gonna see a lot of it e3 but we got some more information this week on shadow of the

1344
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:50,800
Tomb Raider because there was a new trailer that showed up for the game that made its way online

1345
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:56,960
and there was a panel that occurred at the Tribeca Film Festival of all places talking must be

1346
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,720
because of the movie where they were talking a little bit about shadow of the Tomb Raider and

1347
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:05,720
it sounds like behind the scenes some press got to play about 45 minutes of the new game so you'll

1348
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:09,120
probably see plenty more of this e3 this year but they're definitely ramping up for shadow of the

1349
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,960
Tomb Raider which I'm assuming must be a holiday release this must be one of the big holiday

1350
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:19,760
releases they talk about Laura goes from being being hunted to becoming the hunter she's smart

1351
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:25,440
and resourceful and there's more stealth in the game I guess they have the game in the jungle this

1352
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:31,080
time she goes from Mexico to Peru she has all the skills she got in the previous games so they had

1353
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:34,520
to put her in an environment where she's still in danger and the jungle kind of works for that

1354
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:39,680
dr. Dominguez is the name of the antagonist the head of Trinity they'll talk a little bit more

1355
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:44,200
about that at e3 they also say the game is gonna have a lot of open exploration and will have a

1356
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:48,280
lot of characters that can be met in the world apparently even in the first sequence there's

1357
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:52,440
other people and you weren't really used to I mean you kind of would run into other people

1358
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:56,400
here and there in the old Tomb Raider games but you're gonna definitely kind of see more people

1359
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:02,920
than this and also swimming underwater so Laura's learned to swim like well and there are I'm sure

1360
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:07,080
she's got some things that keep her afloat I'm kidding okay and there are special things and

1361
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:13,480
secrets to be found by taking risks and swimming deeper someone got the joke thank you all right

1362
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:21,040
anyway there'll be more to come at e3 by the way just you know I das Montreal is actually making

1363
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:25,200
this game it is not coming from Crystal Dynamics it's actually I das Montreal that's doing this

1364
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:30,840
game so some people have asked well why is I das Montreal doing this and basically they they they

1365
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:36,320
kind of gave a line about well since we did Deus Ex mankind divided it fits perfectly with Laura's

1366
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:40,760
arc we're the perfect choice new it's new flavors you don't always want to do the same thing I don't

1367
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,480
know why they just didn't fucking say Crystal Dynamics is doing the Marvel game we already

1368
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:49,400
knew that they it's not a secret they announced that at last e3 the Crystal Dynamics is doing

1369
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:55,560
this Marvel game so we were talking a little bit about how they're the rumors of like where they

1370
01:18:55,560 --> 01:19:01,000
were trying to tie in like just cause and stuff like that with other you know properties within

1371
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,520
this mm-hmm Marvel Universe we're gonna bring them into the Marvel Universe now because you know

1372
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:14,520
no because Disney that's that's where things get complicated there but well I would imagine

1373
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:21,320
this a Marvel game is something we've got to see more about it this I hope so but if if Shadow of

1374
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:28,120
the Tomb Raider is kind of Square Enix is big kind of this side of the shores release for the

1375
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:33,800
end of the year I would assume the Marvel project is maybe spring early summer next year to tie in

1376
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:40,000
with the net because the the last move well I the last is it the last movie the next movie the next

1377
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,400
Avengers movie that's the last part of this fit because I can't imagine they're gonna stop making

1378
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:51,040
Avengers movies I don't the actors contracts are up after this next one or a lot of them it's they

1379
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:55,960
have a way to deal with that based on the last movie so it'll be fine all right all right fine

1380
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:02,480
so fascinating whatever the the last known Avengers movie is next summer right because they they must

1381
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:06,400
have done these two back-to-back right they said that it was gonna I think I saw on Twitter like

1382
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:12,320
370 days so it's almost it's a little over a year from now okay so it's but it is is next is it's

1383
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:18,080
2019 is the last movie which does not have a title because I guess that would be a spoiler okay the

1384
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:24,240
title what I'm really a spoiler so I'll say no more but okay so I mean it would make a lot of

1385
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:30,320
sense if crystal dynamics you know is gonna drop this you know what I imagine is going to be you

1386
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:35,440
know if it's anything like the Tomb Raider reboot that game was fucking rad when it came out like it

1387
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:39,320
really was kind of pushing the envelope you know and if they're gonna do that with Marvel and make

1388
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:46,880
a heaven forbid good movie video game tie-in brace yourselves then or it could be terrible

1389
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,880
Marvel Ultimate Alliance was pretty good yeah that's true that's true but I mean like something

1390
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:56,200
on the level of like Tomb Raider with Marvel characters is gonna be badass I don't know how

1391
01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:00,720
that would play but yeah I want to see what it is and we're just assuming that it's going to be

1392
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:05,920
a Tomb Raider game with Marvel characters there's obviously they think they have an empty palette

1393
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,560
they can do whatever they want but it would make a lot of sense I don't know dark soccer you like

1394
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:16,360
Marvel would you play a Tomb Raider with Marvel characters yes yeah me too so I'm all for I really

1395
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:21,840
just wanted Jessica Jones game she just walks around drinking and then punching people okay

1396
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:28,200
so like Phoenix Wright but with Jessica Jones no I would like that no it needs it needs more

1397
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:34,280
violence all right okay and she doesn't do courtroom so okay but like the investigative

1398
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:39,400
part yeah but I don't want like Phoenix Wright so like Sam and more like instead of objection

1399
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:45,280
it's just a punch I would maybe if it had to be like a visual novel so I'd want it to be more

1400
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:52,200
like danganronpa okay but I'd rather it be like just a standard so you want a danganronpa game

1401
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:59,120
with Jessica Jones not really I just want a game just like a standard more like L.A. noir maybe

1402
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:04,640
okay but you know that type of game all right that's fair so well we'll see we'll see I'm

1403
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,400
hoping this e3 we're gonna hear a little more about what that is because I'm assuming that's

1404
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:14,640
gonna be a tie-in for the next Avengers movie release since we know it's only a year out so

1405
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,960
some folks in chat are talking about Captain Marvel and how that's currently filming and

1406
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,040
Tiger Claw says Captain Marvel is gonna be interesting because that movie is set in the

1407
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:28,680
90s and we'll deal with the Scrolls so she has Rachel here all right I'm I'm looking forward

1408
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:34,640
to not seeing it because I don't see any other Marvel like Rachel from Friends yes Oh the Rachel

1409
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:41,160
the Rachel haircut yeah she has the Rachel haircut that's okay because I I love Carol Danvers as a

1410
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:47,160
character which I was really disappointed that it was Trish and not Carol Danvers in the Jessica

1411
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:55,280
Jones series cuz in alias in the pulse her BFF is Carol Danvers but I don't mind if we get a

1412
01:22:55,280 --> 01:23:00,320
whole Carol Danvers movie that makes me happy how do you feel about Brie Larson I'm super happy

1413
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:05,640
because I mean the last thing I saw her in was Scott Pilgrim oh right right oh my god like all

1414
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:10,040
those actors and actresses of Scott Pilgrim like went on to like these huge things it's crazy yeah

1415
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:15,400
so I like Brie Larson and she's got a great voice yeah and she's a Sacramento person isn't she

1416
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:24,160
Sacramento actresses I think she is hmm her and that other redhead all right anyway let's move on

1417
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:30,160
Dark Sakura what do you have for us well a game that I'm actually very interested in that has been

1418
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:38,680
on my radar this week but it's a very interesting one not just for how it's played but the the

1419
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:46,480
content as well but it's an interaction an interactive story it's it's a smartphone game

1420
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:52,820
as well called bury me my love and it's about a woman named now or who's trying to escape the

1421
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:59,080
civil war in Syria by fleeing to Europe and the story is told through text messages however it's

1422
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:05,360
based on stories of actual Syrian refugees who you know are trying to communicate with people

1423
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:12,960
back home to show their you know their experiences with this and it makes a very strong statement on

1424
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:21,960
what these people are going through and of course the you know the reactions around the world and

1425
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:29,640
on top of this too you actually get to see the results of your decisions almost immediately like

1426
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:39,320
do you do you sleep somewhere dangerous do you try to pay to bypass dangerous places you know

1427
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:45,560
and what the consequences of these actions are gonna be so and this is made by pixel hunt and

1428
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:53,360
it looks amazing and I think it would make me cry and it's on both iOS and Android I like the concept

1429
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,720
of the game where it's kind of like playing when you're not playing it type of thing mm-hmm how it

1430
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:02,920
might send you like text messages as notifications and yeah it's kind of neat yeah that's a very

1431
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:08,400
interesting interface and I just think I would cry so all right well you should download it and have

1432
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:14,120
a cry you should download it and then support or if the refugees fair enough is there any tie-in

1433
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:19,720
for fundraising for that to the game I didn't see sorry all right well there's other mobile games you

1434
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:25,840
could play right look good yes in fact if you're a Harry Potter fan there's a new Hogwarts game

1435
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:34,880
that's on mobile playing it Hogwarts mystery and basically the game has it takes place before the

1436
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:41,960
actual events in the books so you're trying to investigate I guess your brother has run away or

1437
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:46,440
been expelled from school and trying to figure that stuff out but the thing that everybody loves

1438
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:52,440
the most about this and it's you know wonderful trope of mobile games is energy gotta love that

1439
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:57,240
energy oh you want to do that action well I'm sorry you can't because of energy if only you

1440
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:04,080
had more energy and so that is one of the gripes that people have been making about the game is

1441
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:08,480
that oh yeah you want to get out of the escape the devil's snare hope you have enough energy

1442
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:12,840
you're gonna have to buy that with premium currency the dar Cyrus since you've been playing it have

1443
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:17,760
you been annoyed by energy yet I'll be honest I haven't been playing get a whole bunch so she

1444
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:21,760
probably hasn't hit the wall yet cuz usually usually you can play a good chunk of the game

1445
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,240
where it keeps giving you items that will give you energy so you can go for a little while and

1446
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:30,640
the BAM you hit a wall yeah I mean it looks cool to me you go to classes you learn spells and that

1447
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:35,560
kind of stuff you can pick which house you're in so to be fair if it is a good game then you know

1448
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,580
kicking a little money at it shouldn't be the end of the world it's kind of like you know Super

1449
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:44,080
Mario run if that was something you were into then you pay ten dollars and get the full game

1450
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:49,840
right or you buy it for five dollars when it's on sale or that if you are lucky enough to get it at

1451
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:54,200
that point but yeah I mean but it's I guess they chose not to go that route with this game where

1452
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:58,680
they could have just had you hit a wall and say pay five bucks to pass they decided to do the

1453
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:03,680
energy thing yes maybe because the five dollars ten dollars to pass thing didn't work out so well

1454
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:08,080
for super because it works in other mobile games and maybe figure they're gonna make some money

1455
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:14,040
that way maybe all right well I downloaded it but I haven't played it yet I'm looking forward

1456
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:19,040
to Harry Potter wizards unite because of the whole AR gaming thing but we'll see I'm hoping

1457
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:23,240
it'll let me be a Slytherin that'll be fun anyway before we get to the classic game of the week

1458
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,800
let's talk about some twitch news it's only fair we talked about some mixer news how about some

1459
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:32,760
twitch news so apparently now you know how you can give people bits on twitch which yeah when

1460
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:37,640
you're watching my stream over at Rob Roberts cheap plug you can show me your biddies you can

1461
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:41,740
give me biddies while I'm playing games and that actually basically you're giving me money which

1462
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:46,960
who doesn't like money and honestly the money just goes to pay for all this stuff here at OLR

1463
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:53,240
like I just paid the hosting bill for the network this week and yeah but anyway no it's fine it's

1464
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:59,280
fine um but obviously money helps buy new games and who doesn't like a little bit of money there

1465
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:07,640
are now more ways to incorporate bit stuff onto your stream and that is through extensions so now

1466
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:13,260
twitch has released a variety of extensions that will actually interact with bit donations for

1467
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:19,220
example there's one for League of Legends where you can predict winners and stuff using bits I

1468
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:23,460
don't know if that means it's like a gambling thing where you might win bits if you predict

1469
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:27,220
correctly me it's kind of sounds like that a little bit like you might be doing gambling

1470
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:31,620
with bits I don't want to quote that until I've tried this myself because that could get very

1471
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:37,740
interesting if you're like gambling without gambling yeah it's currency that you're buying

1472
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:41,860
that you're gambling with it's like pachinko it could be interesting I don't know but there's also

1473
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:46,660
things like voting studios so you can actually like make a poll and then in order to vote in

1474
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:53,140
the poll you would have to donate biddies to do that so you know as somebody who does some live

1475
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:58,340
streaming and who is an affiliate on Twitch I'm I think this is cool for people that will be into

1476
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:03,340
it but like you know I don't I don't know I don't want to do like voting based on how much money you

1477
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:10,220
give me that's just for me that's how it works in the real world Rob I it's just accuracy well

1478
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:16,820
played well play well I I don't want the NRA donating to the polls on my stream or any of

1479
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:21,780
that stuff but I don't know I would have to see maybe for the right integration like there's some

1480
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:27,140
where you can play games with the streamer and things like that and maybe I don't know but I

1481
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:32,300
don't know if I I see the right fit for that yet I like to do as much stuff as possible for free

1482
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:37,940
and then if you feel so inclined watch an ad and throw the bits at me like that's that's you know

1483
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:45,340
even if it's just five cents ten cents you know what y'all it adds up it adds up all right let's

1484
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:49,900
see s 200 Matt and chat over at live dog network comm says predict Rob will scream at this one

1485
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:54,020
scary part in this jump scare game yep that's something you could do a biddies if you wanted

1486
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:58,100
to or be even better if it was like you know how they have the twitch integration with different

1487
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:04,460
games where you can like send a jump scare and pay some biddies to send a job maybe maybe yeah

1488
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:09,460
pay some biddies to get jump scared oh I bet I bet that could be a thing the developers have to

1489
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:12,700
kind of put that in the game though I don't know if that would be through extensions I should point

1490
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:18,380
out to the other interesting thing about the extensions with biddies is that you only get as

1491
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:24,420
the streamer you get 80% of the bitty money you don't get the full hundred percent that you do

1492
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:28,880
if somebody just tips you or whatever you only get 80% because you know where the other 20% is

1493
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:33,860
going the extension developer yeah to promote them to keep doing extensions so that's something

1494
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:38,020
else to think about too is that if I use it through extensions I'm actually kind of getting

1495
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:43,380
less money although maybe I'm incentivizing getting more so it's it's a lot to think about

1496
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:48,940
I don't know all right anyhow let's let's go back to a simpler time when you know what there was no

1497
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:54,100
there was no way to live stream your game during Sega's really weird arcade phase right I think I

1498
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:59,180
think you still had to have a camcorder on your shoulder if you wanted to film this right anyway

1499
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:03,140
it's the classic game of the week where dark soccer is gonna step into the gaming vault and

1500
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:09,420
find a game that she thinks hey you brats never came out at home as far as I know all right here

1501
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:13,300
it is the classic game of the week dark soccer would you pick this week I picked a game called

1502
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:20,420
brave firefighters also known as show bullshit brave firefighters in Japan it is a light gun

1503
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:28,980
game and it was the as I recall the first Hikaru game for the Sega Hikaru software came out in 1999

1504
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:35,980
it has a vibrating light gun control it's in the shape of a fire hose you can fight the fires

1505
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:43,300
because the fires need to be thought so you can save your pot stash like Willie Nelson actually

1506
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:50,180
that was a true story anyway and it was as I said the first title that came out for the Hikaru

1507
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:55,900
system and it was also at the time the most technically advanced game of its time it was

1508
01:31:55,900 --> 01:32:02,380
the first one that used Fong shading and now it's the most common shading technique had some

1509
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:09,580
really great lighting and particle fire effects and one of the most detailed environments so this

1510
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:14,580
particular game have you ever played this Rob I think I've seen it I feel like one of the because

1511
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:19,620
this is like it was only released in Japan right um no really it came out in the US I feel like I

1512
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:23,380
saw it somewhere but it was like at an import arcade like either like I don't see arcade

1513
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:29,300
infinity but another one of those type of places I saw it in I want to see one of those like

1514
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:35,740
Koreatown arcades I think I saw this in Las Vegas okay yeah that's when I played it yeah but anyway

1515
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:42,220
the story is that there is an electrical fault that caused the Whitehead Hotel to go up in flames

1516
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:47,420
and Mayor Taylor and his family are trapped inside so you have to go through and put out the fires

1517
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:55,380
and rescue the mayor and his family so you can you hold the drainage button on the hose control

1518
01:32:55,380 --> 01:33:01,580
to release the steam a stream of water but you will deplete your water gauge as you go forward

1519
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:10,980
so you can also twist the nozzle to have like a fog effect that can extinguish fires and flying

1520
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:15,660
sparks as well as destroy obstacles that are in your path you have a time limit for each stage

1521
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:21,100
but you get extra seconds if for each fire that's extinguished quickly and of course when the time

1522
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:27,420
runs out the game ends there was a modified version of brave firefighters that was donated

1523
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:34,460
to the Kyoto Kyoto City disaster prevention center that a different scenario and opening

1524
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:44,380
movie and no time limit so I guess it was for I guess teaching disaster relief but anyway this

1525
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:52,180
particular game again it was notable for being the first Hikaru game which as in essence it was

1526
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:59,820
a modified version of the NAOMI hardware system it had a custom Sega graphics chip larger memory

1527
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:07,100
capacity and they made those modifications for the sake of releasing brave firefighters because

1528
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:13,860
the engineering the engineers had difficulty creating 3d images of the flame and the water

1529
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:24,100
with the NAOMI capability so there you go it led us to all kinds of new innovations that really

1530
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:34,300
was the big big thing about it it was produced by Rikiya Nakagawa and it came out in 1999 that's

1531
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:41,220
about it it was one of those like I said it's that weird era of Sega games yeah but that's

1532
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:48,900
like the cool stuff honestly it is it is and as far as like other stuff that was that came out

1533
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:57,580
for Hikaru I mean I've already covered Planet Harriers which really I think did like the really

1534
01:34:57,580 --> 01:35:03,740
the best I think made the most of the of the system but other of the Hikaru games was the

1535
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:08,580
NASCAR arcade Planet Harriers Starward Racer arcade air tricks which we played a lot of that

1536
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:17,180
and virtual on force and Hikaru was succeeded by NAOMI too so there you go all right s2100

1537
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:21,900
Matt in our chat says this running water gameplay sound will make all the podcast listeners want to

1538
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:36,900
pee for sure well it is a game about fire hoses anyway there it is your classic game of the week

1539
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:41,180
brave firefighters there were all kinds of games like that they were coming out at the time

1540
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:50,020
remember oh yeah like we had what was the Konami ones we had the mocap games like the punch mania

1541
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:53,780
or whatever was called those punch mania but I'm trying to think of what was the police 911 oh

1542
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:59,020
yeah please no one was one and there was like a boxing one too right yeah I remember that but

1543
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:04,380
man that was and I think like what did deadstorm pirates come out on dark to see us as mocap golf

1544
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:13,060
yeah that was it yeah but I'm trying to remember when deadstorm pirates came out it was it wasn't

1545
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:19,260
one of the Sega games was it maybe not all right well you look into that while we take a break

1546
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:22,740
we're gonna take a break and when we come back there's plenty more of Orange Lounge radio to

1547
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:27,620
come including rapid-fire news maybe emails although there weren't any when I check before

1548
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:32,940

Animal Crossing ones have costumes in Odyssey yeah they don't work for the Mario games they're fine

1563
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:51,980
whatever sorry I was gonna say though JD because you mentioned we didn't have an opportunity to

1564
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:55,980
bring this up earlier in the show we should mention it now so JD's been spending the weekend

1565
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:01,260
with me and we've been you know doing doing such manly things like yesterday we went and

1566
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:07,660
got mani pedis it was so much fun and it was oh my god I don't know why more dudes don't allow

1567
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:11,780
themselves just go get mani pedis because seriously my nails have never looked better

1568
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:19,020
like and I don't okay now JD went the extra route and went with a glitter blue color so like his

1569
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:25,420
nails are like like nails so I did like a lighter turquoise on my hands and like a deep like royal

1570
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:32,700
blue on my toes okay do you remember when we had Steve here for Flom yeah he always has his done

1571
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:37,300
yeah I mean and honestly my nails don't look good well here's the I didn't I they're they're quote

1572
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:41,860
unquote painted but it's clear yeah and the only reason I had them do the clear is that a it does

1573
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:47,660
look really good but B it makes me not bite them and so like honestly like the best tip if you bite

1574
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:51,300
your nails you want to stop doing it like paint your nails clear used to never stop me because

1575
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:56,580
really oh my god so disgusting those are trying to eat a switch cartridge it would I would just

1576
01:38:56,580 --> 01:39:00,740
peel all of it off in this to go back to chewing but I'm always like okay I'm always like disgusted

1577
01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:05,020
and I was a kid though I'm also just I'm disgusted and fascinated when they do the nails because they

1578
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:08,860
don't just they don't just trim the nails like they dig the whole thing into the cuticles to

1579
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:13,180
like help prevent hang nails and stuff like that and I'm always like shocked at how much shit they

1580
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:17,660
get it I'm like oh my god that's all on my this is what the sad thing is that cuticle is actually

1581
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:22,300
do serve a purpose yeah except that people have started taking it off to make it look like you've

1582
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:27,180
got a longer nail bed mm-hmm I mean that's the whole thing for it but I think that you know

1583
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:32,860
keeping it I'd say trimmed like at least every month or so you know promotes healthy growth so

1584
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:39,020
I need I need to I'm probably gonna go get all mine done before drag con well but if you're not

1585
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:44,060
wearing nails you're not doing drag I got I'm saying you can you can get just a manicure

1586
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:48,380
pedicure without having your nails like done yeah use basically basically it's like getting

1587
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:53,580
a haircut you don't know in there and get it died and I want a white gel base cut hmm but I

1588
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:59,020
want gels just to have something that Alan have that done not that long ago he had like the blue

1589
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:03,620
gel it looked really good even though it's like you know you don't see a lot of dudes with their

1590
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:07,060
nails painted but it looked really good but it was like dang that's like permit he had to go in

1591
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:10,820
it took him like 30 minutes to get it off yeah cuz you have to soak them off yeah yeah but Rob

1592
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:15,540
if you get the gels you won't be able to bite your nails that's because they're like they're

1593
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:20,420
really yeah that's true but I always recommend because I had them glued on once and it ruined

1594
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:25,020
my remember when we didn't allow to my nails were so thin and hurt to the touch oh yeah that was

1595
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:30,060
because they glued them on and I reacted to the glue so you always should have them build on top

1596
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:33,660
of the natural nail you know and if you play a lot of DDR or pump it up you should treat yourself

1597
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:40,260
to a pedicure because yeah or if you that athlete you know athletes have to get pedicures like all

1598
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:44,700
the time because they fuck up their feet yeah so Loki have you ever had a mani-pedi you should

1599
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:48,420
consider getting one done now that's a lot of fun it's fun we'll go some time dance dance and he

1600
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:52,140
would go with me because there's two nails are atrocious and I can't do anything with them there

1601
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:57,820
you go all right I'm his esthetician all right let's move on we got to get back to video games

1602
01:40:57,820 --> 01:41:02,660
you have to have those perfect fingers to hold controllers so that the big old you know gross

1603
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:08,500
nails don't get in the way anyway to register participation for this week's episode of orange

1604
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:15,260
lounge radio at fog network comm use the passphrase teacher let's get into some rapid fire news and

1605
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:20,060
talk about some other news that has happened this week rapidly Loki let's talk about my favorite

1606
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:26,980
topic when it comes to Nintendo and that's online it's still coming out September at least whatever

1607
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:32,220
they have planned however they're gonna be talking about what it is that's gonna be coming out in

1608
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:40,820
September it's gonna be revealed in May so this is coming from the current president Tatsumi Kimi

1609
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:47,580
Shima basically say that Nintendo switch online a paid subscription service that will expand the

1610
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:52,580
online functionality of the switch will begin in September of this year the service will provide

1611
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:57,860
consumers with a richness of online features that allow them to continuously enjoy Nintendo switch

1612
01:41:57,860 --> 01:42:04,540
more from hot air hot air I know it's like this doesn't tell me jack shit I do know that they have

1613
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:10,820
the costs listed online but we still don't know exactly what that will entail and it says it's

1614
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:16,180
gonna have access to a library of classic games I just wish they would still like I don't don't

1615
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:20,220
be wrong I think it's cool that they want to do like a Netflix type thing where you have access

1616
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:25,580
to stuff but the same time just let me buy things like it's worked for the other systems why now

1617
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:31,060
do you okay I'm I'm all for a Netflix style classic thing that would just you could play

1618
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:36,980
whatever you want that would be an amazing deal oh my god but did you notice I don't think it

1619
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:41,100
comes up later in the show where I hope I'm not spoiling a story but there was a bunch of

1620
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:46,880
trademarks by Nintendo this week on things like dr. Mario and some other Mario games so and my

1621
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:51,260
brain went to because some people are like oh they're gonna redo these games so no these are

1622
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:57,060
probably the first releases on this Nintendo online probably dr. Mario would make a lot of

1623
01:42:57,060 --> 01:43:02,660
sense a lot of sense as a debut game especially if this is whole you can play with friends across

1624
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:08,580
the internet dr. Mario makes a fuck of a lot of sense as a game to include with this to start and

1625
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:12,820
I'm fine if those games have that functionality but I would also like it like if I don't care

1626
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:16,700
about playing over the other people they just be able to purchase the virtual console games

1627
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:23,060
you've released on a few systems already yeah I mean why I'm sure Nintendo will happily take your

1628
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:31,740
money in whatever form you want to give it to him we'll see I don't know anyways and then of course

1629
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:37,220
we talked about it a couple weeks ago about how the rock star was basically giving polling some

1630
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:45,660
music from Grand Theft Auto 4 in regards to most of us was to be from the the Russian radio station

1631
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:50,220
that was in the game but apparently it's not just that so there are several different stations are

1632
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:57,260
affected by this and even like a lot of the rock songs so they even had like of David Bowie songs

1633
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:04,620
taken from the game I know I kind of went through the whole list of stuff thankfully the some of the

1634
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:11,140
songs I did listen to quite a bit are still in the game but some are not in the ones that they

1635
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:18,060
replace them with are kind of lame I don't know and I I find it frustrating though like and I

1636
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:23,060
understand why that they have to patch this out now because they're still selling the game it

1637
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:27,460
would be different than like say if they sold the game and then they weren't selling it anymore and

1638
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:32,820
so the other licenses expired there's nothing that they're gonna really do to the game but now it's

1639
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:38,700
still some active thing that it's just gonna be removed from it so if you have a console version

1640
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:44,700
the game you're kind of screwed however if you're on PC people have already found ways to put back

1641
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:50,820
the removed songs into the game so if you are you know bothered by that course they did then you can

1642
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:56,780
go ahead and do that and of course if you have like a PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 version of that

1643
01:44:56,780 --> 01:45:03,060
those games then you can always keep your console offline if you want to keep your you know songs in

1644
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:08,980
there honestly I mean it's disappointing I did like a lot of the Russian songs that were in the

1645
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:13,820
game but I it wasn't one of the main stations I listened to I mean it wasn't the first the

1646
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:19,060
granted out for that was before you know the validate Tony and lost in the dam where they

1647
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:23,700
added more a whole nother I think dance music station so I listened to the rest of the station

1648
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:32,260
because it was mostly it was Russian music and dance music which why okay all right well moving

1649
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:37,620
on to talk about Nintendo Splatfest the next Splatfest has been announced and it's it's a

1650
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:41,420
little different it's not kind of the same that they've been doing for other Splatfest because

1651
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:47,140
this is gonna be a three-parter because it is to determine who is your favorite Ninja Turtle and

1652
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:52,500
so the first round starts this next weekend which will be Raphael versus Leonardo will be the first

1653
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:59,460
matchup Raphael Leonardo actually round two will be Mike Michelangelo or Mikey versus Donny did they

1654
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:04,580
shorten all the names Donatello yeah Donatello that's what they call them now the new Nickelodeon

1655
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:11,220
series all right Mikey and Donny then around two and then the finals will be May 18th and obviously

1656
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:15,060
Donatello is the best and should be the one that everybody picks although I don't know how these

1657
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:20,140
new ones are I'm thinking Donatello from back in the day so maybe maybe it's different it's always

1658
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:27,100
the best this is probably the first splat I'm not gonna you just you're really I can't be bothered

1659
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:31,220
with this huh I mean Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was never my thing plus we could have had the

1660
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:36,060
Japan one and I'm so mad well let's talk about the Japan one actually since you brought it up so

1661
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:42,020
Japan doesn't really have the same thing with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles so instead the San

1662
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:47,380
Rio character collaboration ranking contest is happening in Japan voting for the event starts on

1663
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:52,860
May 10th there will be characters represented in a crossover including Splatoon 2 cross San

1664
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:57,380
Rio I but then there's a cute little Hello Kitty dressed up as an inkling type of thing it looks

1665
01:46:57,380 --> 01:47:01,060
adorable I don't know if that means they're getting like a San Rio Splatfest or what that

1666
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:05,260
is we don't know exactly understanding but that's probably what it is Hello Kitty versus Bats

1667
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:09,660
Maru I would so be about that that would be amazing why can't they do that over here as well

1668
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:15,980
I'm right good question good fucking question it's it's weird some of the marketing choices

1669
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:20,860
that they've made because they've done like McDonald's Splatfest in Japan only and I'm like

1670
01:47:20,860 --> 01:47:27,660
you'd think that if they were gonna do that there well it was like chicken nuggets versus fries I

1671
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:32,460
mean it was like dude you can't put anything up against fries fries are always gonna win

1672
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:37,300
but chicken McNuggets already good see see now we have a Splatfest already but the point was

1673
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:42,380
like McDonald's is just such a very classic American thing that I'm surprised they didn't

1674
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:48,660
decide to do it here yeah you know they need to do here is the flavorings like they have at

1675
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:54,220
McDonald's in Japan right oh they already did that disgusting ketchup and mayonnaise why no

1676
01:47:54,220 --> 01:47:57,940
it's like ketchup and mustard no I'm talking about that you put them in the bag and shake

1677
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:06,540
them up and they have like a curry flavor and here with the fries too they have like flavored

1678
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:13,260
fries that's right they did they had the shaker bags McDonald's and they sucked ass so like it

1679
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:19,660
wasn't curry it was like ranch flavor it'd be amazing ranching they have like garlic parmesan

1680
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:23,300
like ooh I like garlic parmesan and they tried it on the fries like wow these ruin the fries

1681
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:27,540
well I'm never doing that again I don't trust McDonald's to have good food I was just saying

1682
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:32,100
it's popular here because it's all right all right we're turning too much into orange on foodio

1683
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:37,500
let's bring it back to games talking about the next somebody's doing classic games on the switch

1684
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:42,900
that's for sure but it is it's neo geo that's actually doing those games on the switch it is

1685
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:49,420
the ACA collection featuring games in this coming month including super sidekicks to the World

1717
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:14,260

fuck maybe paint it I'll do it how I want that's right that Warhammer one of the attorneys they

1729
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:34,260
work for is a big Warhammer gamer which we found out when we were talking about like cons and stuff

1730
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:40,100
it was yeah I've seen actually the big con you know full-scale Warhammer things are pretty

1731
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:46,700
exciting to watch but pretty terrible to prepare for all right well this is usually the part of the

1732
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:50,660
show where we would visit the mail bag and participate at orange laundry calm to read all

1733
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:53,940
those lovely emails you send us I found dust bunnies but I believe we have an empty mail

1734
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:59,980

1738
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:22,260

1739
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:26,060
at orange laundry calm I want to hear from every listener so I know how many listeners we have

1740
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:31,700
tacos are amazing all right because I don't know I forgot the password to look at all our stats so

1741
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:37,380
like I don't even know how many listeners we have anymore all right so moving on let's get into some

1742
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:43,780
more gaming news Loki all right so things are kind of getting ridiculous as far as the whole

1743
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:51,460
pub G cheans sorry goes so you may remember there was a group of people that were making certain

1744
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:58,140
subscription cheat services for pub G and they made quite a billion or quite a bit of money off

1745
01:54:58,140 --> 01:55:05,380
of that of course they found themselves in so with some legal trouble with bluehole now there's

1746
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:13,500
actually been arrests and fines being placed on them so they had 15 suspects that were arrested

1747
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:20,500
for developing hack programs hosting marketplaces for hack programs and brokering transactions the

1748
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:27,500
currently the suspects have been fined approximately 5.1 million dollars and then other suspects

1749
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:33,460
related to the case are still being investigated sucks to be them dude I didn't know you could go

1750
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:38,940
to jail for cheating in an online game well I think it's more than just it's probably making

1751
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:45,940
the cheats and you know still though come on it's a fucking game what kind this is in the US no okay

1752
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:51,100
so it's other other countries is against the law yeah yeah that's what it is so wow all right I

1753
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:56,820
guess they take that stuff seriously but seriously though like I get it I get yeah it's bad that they

1754
01:55:56,820 --> 01:56:02,060
you're cheating yeah you know shut them down do a cease and desist and all that shit but really

1755
01:56:02,060 --> 01:56:07,900
arresting people and fighting them 5.1 million dollars haven't we talked about a spanking like

1756
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:11,740
I'm not talking about a caning or any of that stuff I'm talking about you need to take them

1762
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:51,460
blue hole doing this because these are the same fucking people are like you copied us we're

1763
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:56,380
fucking pissed off so we're suing you because you use a fucking frying pan in your fucking game so

1764
01:56:56,380 --> 01:57:05,420
yes I could see them doing some bullshit like this all right anyhow guys you don't chat at

1765
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:11,620
live.vog network.com wants to know how the fuck did that nanny show stay on TV so long there's a

1766
01:57:11,620 --> 01:57:16,540
lot of shows isn't a friend dresser was great because she was also in UHF and this is final

1767
01:57:16,540 --> 01:57:22,860
tap The Simpsons I think has officially become the longest-running scripted series on television

1768
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:29,780
ever and that is a show that stopped being funny a long time ago and we still have more episodes

1769
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:35,980
of them and yeah same boat but what can you do all right SHO 100 Matt suggests they should all

1770
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:47,060
have to endure a yelling by the God Warrior lady this is dark-sided I do miss wife swap that was a

1771
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:53,340
fun that was a good show good times it sounds like a completely different show actually I wife swap

1772
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:59,460
was the ABC show God Warrior was on the Fox version was the trading spouses oh same shit

1773
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:04,940
big difference oh no no cuz that that God Warrior is better than anything that was ever on one of

1774
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:11,180
those names is a pun I think trading spouses is a pun off of trading spaces I think it is yeah I

1775
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:17,220
think you're right all right anyway moving on this is unfortunately not really a humorous piece of

1776
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:22,340
news because this has to tie into things that have happened in the real world and how they can yes

1777
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:28,060
impact the side of video games especially the business side of games so a game was supposed

1778
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:33,500
to be released on the switch the PlayStation 4 and Xbox this week Xbox one this week with its

1779
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:39,620
different ports that game was called Death Road to Canada and I'm sure you can imagine why it may

1780
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:45,300
be in poor taste for a game with that title to come out right now because of the horrific incident

1781
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:50,020
that happened in Toronto earlier this week so developer rocket cat games and publisher

1782
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:55,780
Yukio publishing have delayed the title indefinitely with a statement that says we

1783
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:59,820
feel it would be deeply inappropriate to launch the game at such a time we would like to express

1784
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:05,740
our deepest condolences to everyone affected by the tragic events in Toronto so they've they've

1785
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:09,820
stopped this indefinitely I don't think that means they'll never put them out but they'll

1786
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:14,500
probably push it back to around the holiday or you know a time when hopefully people have been

1787
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:19,340
able to heal a little bit from the craziness that happened there it should be pointed out now this

1788
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:24,380
article says Death Road to Canada makes no references to aggravated assault but like if

1789
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:29,660
you actually look at the game you do play like you're in a car and you're a person in the car

1790
01:59:29,660 --> 01:59:33,380
but you're like an animal you play this little dog that kind of drives around in the car and

1791
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:38,900
you're like fucking shooting and running over people but they're zombies so because they're

1792
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:46,700
zombies it's okay but obviously you can see where it's a little too close to events in the real

1793
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:51,900
world right now so they've had to delay it so it's just kind of goes to show that sometimes

1794
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:56,620
events that happen in the real world they can have an impact on gaming especially because you know

1795
01:59:56,620 --> 02:00:01,500
it would have been kind of shitty business sense to release a game like that right now you know one

1796
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:05,700
of those news networks would have done a very exploitative piece about it so just now is not

1797
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:11,740
the time for pit bulls holding shotguns to shoot down zombies and drive over them in their car I

1798
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:16,580
will just come out later it is on steam if you want to play the game I will tell you if there's

1799
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:23,900
ever a video game that one made into a movie that sounds awesome well anyway it is on steam if you

1800
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:28,500
do want to judge for yourself and there's trailers available online and all that stuff so yeah there

1801
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:34,940
you go I'm going in chat over at live dot vog network comm s to 100 Matt reminds us there were

1802
02:00:34,940 --> 02:00:40,180
a ton of games that got delayed due to 9-eleven you know when that happened that also 9-eleven

1803
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:46,140
had impact on movies TV all of it oh yeah yeah well like other shows too like Buffy had an

1804
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:51,980
episode they delayed because of Columbine yep yep I remember 9-eleven because that caused that show

1805
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:56,100
the mole to get really erratic schedule that was my favorite reality game show that was ever on TV

1806
02:00:56,100 --> 02:01:00,260
the Anderson Cooper hosted and that show was amazing I didn't really see hosted that yeah

1807
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:03,780
Anderson Cooper hosted them all the first yeah it was before his big CNN stuff and all that

1808
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:11,260
still have gray hair back then yes he did yes he did so he went great really early so I you should

1809
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:16,260
and he looked fabulous doing it he was a great host I was still upset with him though you should

1810
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:24,500
what are you over Kathy Griffin oh he was such a shit to her over the whole yeah yeah not as bad

1811
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:31,300
as Andy Cohen well Andy Cohen is also but anyway look you should go check out Anderson Cooper in

1812
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:34,540
his prime on the mole and that was the best reality game show there ever was I'm almost

1813
02:01:34,540 --> 02:01:40,380
positive it's all on YouTube if you look up the mole season one but season two was displaced by

1814
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:46,580
9-eleven because they it got terrible ratings because people didn't you know that they've got

1815
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:52,340
boosted back because the news coverage was on else it just it never had a chance it's like the dark

1816
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:55,660
shadows revival which I feel like we talked about on the show a few weeks ago the dark shadows

1817
02:01:55,660 --> 02:02:01,460
revival got screwed up because the Gulf War coverage so anyway Kai's you don't chat says

1818
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:07,180
the mole was the shit they fucked it up with celebrity mole ironically now spoiler alert for

1819
02:02:07,180 --> 02:02:13,300
a show that is well over 10 years old at this point but Kathy Griffin won celebrity mole one

1820
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:18,820
of the time she was on it but it was not Anderson Cooper was done being the whole host they had

1821
02:02:18,820 --> 02:02:24,060
somebody else a moderate shot I think was sport they moved on to sports personalities hosting it

1822
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:28,340
and I think he was the one that hosted it that season when Kathy Griffin won that sounds like

1823
02:02:28,340 --> 02:02:34,500
the worst choice for a reality show host sports personality he wasn't as good as it he did okay

1824
02:02:34,820 --> 02:02:39,140
but he wasn't Anderson Cooper it was just like I don't remember the guy they tried to do a revival

1825
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:46,380
of the mole oh god it was probably 2010 2011 they did a new season of the mole it was the mole

1826
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:53,340
season 5 and they had another sports guy doing it and I don't remember his name but it just it

1827
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:58,820
just didn't work it was still a decent show but it just wasn't the same as the first two seasons

1828
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:03,220
which were amazing didn't they do like an international version too well the mole was

1829
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:06,900
an international show it started it started in the Netherlands where I think all our good

1830
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:10,700
reality TV comes from that's what I'm thinking cuz like survivors from their big brothers from

1831
02:03:10,700 --> 02:03:18,460
there all of it yeah so anyway um phantasm chat over at live dog network comm says people think

1832
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:23,900
Toronto in the center of the universe in Canada but there's other cities too yes Canada is a very

1833
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:28,020
very very big place people sometimes forget that it's a it's a bigger country than the US believe

1834
02:03:28,020 --> 02:03:32,700
it or not but I mean if there's a lot of less there's a lot of lowly populated areas because

1835
02:03:32,700 --> 02:03:36,740
the closer you get to the North Pole and all that but if you have a national tragedy like it's

1836
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:40,740
sensitive should delay it like it doesn't matter that there's other parts of Canada like they're

1837
02:03:40,740 --> 02:03:48,700
being sensitive oh for sure for sure anyway um Tiger Claw chat says could a new mole work in

1838
02:03:48,700 --> 02:03:54,020
today's climate fuck yeah it could I don't know who owns the rights to it here but I always see

1839
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:58,140
I love the mole I'm getting into my like soapbox that really doesn't have anything to do with

1840
02:03:58,140 --> 02:04:02,820
gaming but it's game show so it's kind of adjacent um here's the thing the mole to me

1841
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:06,780
part of the reason I loved it is it was very James Bond in the types of things that they had to do

1842
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:12,020
and if you didn't know this premise of the mole basically it was that you have ten contestants

1843
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:16,780
and they all do these challenges to put money in the pot and at the end of the game one of them is

1844
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:22,420
gonna win all the money but one of the contestants is the mole and they are working against to try to

1845
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:27,500
fuck up the pot basically and as much money as they can keep out of the pot they get some type

1846
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:32,180
of stipend from the producers and so forth so at the end of every episode they have to take a

1847
02:04:32,180 --> 02:04:36,900
test the contestants take a test who is the mole and that's part probably part of the reason why

1848
02:04:36,900 --> 02:04:41,500
the show wasn't as glamorous because there's no voting there's no whatever you take a test they

1849
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:45,540
did have they called it coalitions which was basically alliances where you could kind of

1850
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:49,380
collaborate notes with people and try to figure it out but you know then the mole would get

1851
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:53,700
involved in that shit too and fuck players up so you would take these tests and whoever got the

1852
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:57,580
lowest score at the end was executed at the end of the episode that's the caught they said welcome

1853
02:04:57,580 --> 02:05:03,940
to your first execution this is the results of the quiz and it was like suspenseful ass-clenching

1854
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:08,780
television the way they did like because Anderson Cooper would like look around the room and he'd be

1855
02:05:08,780 --> 02:05:13,660
like whoever the contestant I don't remember he'd be like Jamie and he would type the name into the

1856
02:05:13,660 --> 02:05:17,940
computer and he'd press enter and there would be like the longest fucking pause and then it would

1857
02:05:17,940 --> 02:05:22,980
go go green and that means they're safe or it would go red and if it went red it would go

1858
02:05:23,860 --> 02:05:28,100
like that and basically Anderson Cooper would walk over to the contestant say please come with me and

1859
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:31,660
pick them up take them out of the room to the car that's it like the other contestants couldn't hug

1860
02:05:31,660 --> 02:05:37,820
them say goodbye or anything like that just up out and that was awesome like did the odd do you

1861
02:05:37,820 --> 02:05:41,900
find out who the mole is at the end or do you know from the get-go of course you didn't know you find

1862
02:05:41,900 --> 02:05:47,340
out at the end because they leave they left clues in every episode and so at the very end they say

1863
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:51,700
here was the clue in episode one here was the clue in episode two then they tell you what the

1864
02:05:51,700 --> 02:05:55,980
clues were to the mole's identity and some of them were really stupid and I think that's part

1865
02:05:55,980 --> 02:06:02,620
of why the fifth season didn't work is that one of the clues was so obvious and ridiculous like it

1866
02:06:02,620 --> 02:06:07,980
kind of ruined it I think so I'm not gonna spoil it in case now because I'm actually excited people

1867
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:12,420
sound interested in it they might go back and watch it but the first couple seasons were pretty

1868
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:17,100
decent with the clues some were a stretch but you know they didn't want the internet was still kind

1869
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:20,580
of coming alive in that age and they didn't want people to get out on the internet and say who it

1870
02:06:20,580 --> 02:06:24,780
was and ruin it for everybody but you would you would find out in the last episode who it was the

1871
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:30,820
season with BB Zahara Benet really stretched BB Zahara Benet was not on the mole she was the mole

1872
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:38,860
she's not the mole going to chat over at live.voggannetwork.com there's actually comments here

1873
02:06:38,860 --> 02:06:43,700
Kaijuto says they could make the mole into a video game or a board game too I feel like there was a

1874
02:06:43,700 --> 02:06:47,700
tie-in that didn't happen I will okay I'm gonna tell you what I'll tell you one more thing about

1875
02:06:47,780 --> 02:06:53,860
the mole that I thought was brilliant so it was the end of the first episode so you know how like

1876
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:59,260
everybody has their luggage that they go on or whatever on a trip or whatever so Anderson Cooper

1877
02:06:59,260 --> 02:07:05,020
says okay so here is the test I'm gonna ask you all trivia questions about the other players and

1878
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:10,380
you're not allowed to confer with each other this challenge is called the burning bags over here on

1879
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:15,620
a forklift we have your bags every time you answer a question wrong they will be lowered slowly into

1880
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:21,580
this fire if you get three questions wrong your bags will be burned and so what happens like the

1881
02:07:21,580 --> 02:07:26,340
first three questions they get wrong and so all of their bags burn and they're all fucking crying

1882
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:33,500
and shit because like someone's like like they're all like losing their shit but then spoiler alert

1883
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:37,140
at the very beginning of the next episode you find out they were just fucking with them those

1884
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:45,620
are fake bags yeah like as you're watching you're like this is so fucking cruel I can't what this is

1885
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:51,700
like this is mean television so far and then it turns out oh just like that one show they have

1886
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:56,620
never they had like that one show it was like the the Joe project or something like that is basically

1887
02:07:56,620 --> 02:08:02,900
it's one dude so they think they've made him seem think that he was on a reality show but it wasn't

1888
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:09,060
actually a reality show we were just fucking with him the entire time but then in the fifth season

1889
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:15,060
they did something like it again but they did it with their journals they did the place where they

1890
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:19,500
take all the notes they said here's your journals and we're gonna look and they really did it like

1891
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:25,180
they got it wrong and the journals all got burned and it was like well they have no more notes but

1892
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:30,080
that's different because the journals were just simply for the purposes of you know reviewing

1893
02:08:30,080 --> 02:08:34,000
notes and stuff like that and I think there was another twist where they had to like they had to

1894
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:39,520
give the journal to somebody else so anyway I could I could just do like a podcast for 700

1895
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:45,280
episodes about the mole and what a great show it was so if anybody out there has the power to bring

1896
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:49,180
the mole back to television you should do it and I will happily host it and I will be as good as

1897
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:53,080
Anderson Cooper have you ever found a social media version like you know you play this Facebook

1898
02:08:53,080 --> 02:09:00,080
reality games thank you for bringing that up no I they did do a version on live journal of the

1899
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:05,960
mole I never played it but I watched it and it was you know that as good as it can be for a live

1900
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:10,200
journal game but part of the what made the mole really exciting was that they were traveling to

1901
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:14,520
all these extravagant locations like I remember the first season ended they did the big reveal

1902
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:18,640
and like this giant Coliseum in Spain you know and it was like they were going to all these like

1903
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:22,920
crazy-ass location that's what made a very James Bond so and then that's why the celebrity mole

1904
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:28,600
was stupid because celebrity mole was like we're in Hawaii or I think the other one was we're in

1905
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:37,680
Mexico and like they didn't leave the one little resort they were at it was stupid so anyway act

1906
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:43,000
Efton chat says Kai's you know that's what I'm saying let jackpot lick jackbox make it okay

1907
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:48,440
Judah says we play games online and the mole has to fuck the team up there you go jackbox I know

1908
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:55,520
some of y'all are out there figure out how to get the license to the mole and do it that'd be

1909
02:09:55,520 --> 02:10:01,640
awesome interview them when they come on the show and ask them about them all right anyway

1910
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:07,520
uh let's move on that we got more stories to get into I guess I filled up this week's mailbag

1911
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:12,120
segment with discussion on the mole so this is what happens if you don't email us in a future

1912
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:19,200
week I I have the right to go on reality TV tangent for 20 minutes all right let's get into

1913
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:24,480
some more news we actually did a couple stories and I think we're up to Jamie and your last story

1914
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:35,320
here before calls well Sega made one significant sale over the last week in quarter 1 2018 a Sega

1915
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:46,520
Game Gear title sold for retail as in it touched a retail POS yes and the game was Sonic the hedgehog

1916
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:56,520
2 for Sega Game Gear not aftermarket not eBay not used it sold for fucking retail just like it was

1917
02:10:56,520 --> 02:11:04,640
1992 so who had Game Gear games on their shelf in 1992 I don't know but they want to find it

1918
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:13,800
basically the it came from an NPD group analyst named Matt Piscatella who said that the report

1919
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:19,240
came in and now they want to know who the fuck it was Kmart I'm telling you it came from a Kmart

1920
02:11:19,240 --> 02:11:27,520
it had to be the tweet no it's two tweets someone in the US market bought a brand new copy of Sonic

1921
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:33,080
2 for Game Gear at retail in March 2018 I want to know who this person is where they bought it

1922
02:11:33,080 --> 02:11:38,600
and how it all happened like was it just buried in some back room for the last 20 years did it get

1923
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:44,440
lost underneath some retail fixture was it the 20 year old pre-order what was the reaction when

1924
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:51,560
the person who bought it saw it so many questions I have it's totally one of those things like you

1925
02:11:51,560 --> 02:11:55,440
know where they do have that stuff hidden away when they just find it in their back room or

1926
02:11:55,440 --> 02:12:00,680
something because I've seen like lots of different posts that usually is like a Walmart's like you

1927
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:05,080
know they where they kind of go searching for old things and like they'll have you know 56 K

1928
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:11,360
modems or you know ridiculous it's a Kmart and are there any that have a diner still check those

1929
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:17,440
first no one of the theories is that it's a Toys R Us self I guess that it could be old stock

1930
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:23,000
leftover during the liquidation so somebody like like what's behind this door at the Toys R Us oh

1931
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:30,400
we don't go back there okay open it what's in there and that's my guy the the timing matches

1932
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:35,760
up and the age of it matches up like but wouldn't it when did the Toys R Us liquidation start

1933
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:40,480
because this is first couple weeks ago it was in March it was in March and this is a March sale

1934
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:46,000
Toys R Us in a few weeks then again no other deals let me see when the announcement for the Toys R

1935
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,860
Us liquidation so go into something else and I'll research act Defton chat says can we have a

1936
02:12:49,860 --> 02:12:55,440
reality show for those types of things finding old stuff in retail stores it's called unsolved

1937
02:12:55,440 --> 02:13:02,560
mysteries that's the theme I should have played that was March 21st is when they announced the

1938
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:09,600
start date according to fortune but I'm trying to get the exact day that it began see that's my

1939
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:13,200
thing is I don't think the people are saying Toys R Us is the easy answer here but I don't

1940
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:19,080
think Toys R Us things started until earlier this month I mean the other thing is like if have they

1941
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:24,760
put out the April numbers yet because if it's a big chain and they started really late into March

1942
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:30,840
maybe they'll find more reports in April maybe the only it doesn't have the date on it just says

1943
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:36,640
that it was going into effect after the 21st of March so it could be a theory I I would still

1944
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:41,880
bet money it's a Kmart I mean are there any Kmarts that are having problems like that in

1945
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:49,720
closing like all over at they all Oh Sears I wonder if it's a Sears inventory I know Sears

1946
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:54,880
got out of the game business a long time ago but Sears are liquidating to aren't they some of them

1947
02:13:54,880 --> 02:14:00,160
Sears was in the game business back when this game was out I mean I maybe grandma found it at Sears

1948
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:05,440
so the other thing is like if it were like a big chain or something I feel like we would see more

1949
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:10,200
than just one sale like the fact that it's only one feels weird well they would have destroyed

1950
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:15,160
them or returned them like a long time ago or clean the clean anything like one branch like if

1951
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:22,000
it's like that it would just be like just write it off it's so old anything else on this Jamie

1952
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:27,720
all right it's a collector's item now all right let's move on a couple more stories for you guys

1953
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:31,760
and then we're gonna open up the skype line at orange lounge radio on skype okay hopefully this

1954
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:38,240
will be end of some of this loot box stuff but Belgium has ruled that loot boxes in certain games

1955
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:44,760
are illegal so loot boxes as seen in like FIFA 18 Overwatch counter-strike global offensive are now

1956
02:14:44,760 --> 02:14:53,600
illegal in Belgium and if you are company is still having those loot boxes in your games you can be

1957
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:59,880
subject to criminal punishment including fines up to 800,000 euros which is just under 1 million

1958
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:05,480
dollars I'm pretty sure I am prison sentences so I'm pretty sure if it weren't for the prison

1959
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:10,560
sentences they probably just take the fine and say fuck it but now they'll have to somehow remove

1960
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:17,000
these I would assume or stop selling their game in Belgium and you know they said the Belgium

1961
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:22,960
Commission has not contacted us or shared its report and that's from EA we strongly believe

1962
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:27,880
that our games are developed and implemented ethically and lawfully around the world and we

1963
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:42,280
take these responsibilities very seriously sure EA I totally believe that yeah so I guess they're

1964
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:48,120
gonna start a dialogue but I mean it's kind of ironic though that EA would be making a comment

1965
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:52,920
about this being that you know the fact that they fucked with Star Wars kind of started this whole

1966
02:15:53,160 --> 02:16:01,320
avalanche in the first place hmm all right by the way dark to see is shared this in chat apparently

1967
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:07,720
the sale for Sonic 2 happened in Wisconsin they know that it was a retail location in Wisconsin

1968
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:12,260
I'm telling you it's a Kmart in Wisconsin fascinating yeah we should interview Trixie Mattel

1969
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:19,400
and get her local expert feedback on this matter maybe maybe anyway so back to the loot boxes so

1970
02:16:19,400 --> 02:16:22,720
what's gonna happen it they just gonna pull overwatch out of Belgium so that they don't go

1971
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:27,160
to jail I don't know or patch it out or something I would I would I would well they'll probably still

1972
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:31,480
continue to have overwatch but they're just you just get the basic skins you don't get any of the

1973
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:37,040
extra stuff which would suck because the holiday events aren't gonna be very special yeah I don't

1974
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:40,360
know I'd be very curious to see how companies like Blizzard and stuff are gonna respond is or

1975
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:45,040
maybe they'll just stop selling the games there I mean it's not like people that want to get the

1976
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:49,520
game aren't feel gonna be able to go somewhere else yeah especially in a company like Belgium

1977
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:56,240
or in a country like Belgium all right anyhow one more story for you guys it's also something

1978
02:16:56,240 --> 02:17:00,160
that's gonna impact Blizzard it's something that they had talked about a long time ago in fact I

1979
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:05,600
think way back when this game was first announced 2009 Blizzard said that Starcraft 2 would have a

1980
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:12,400
map marketplace with the options to buy and sell custom maps well now that it's 2018 nine years

1981
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:19,960
later it's finally gonna be a reality so the Starcraft arcade which allows you to create and

1982
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:27,040
play custom maps will add a premium fan-made map alongside the next big patch which is version 4.3

1983
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:33,280
they say it's very similar to the creation club by Bethesda Blizzard will handpick specific prominent

1984
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:37,720
community creators and work with them to create new maps and modes and the share of the sales will

1985
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:42,080
go directly to the creators and of course some of it to Blizzard as well for the promotion Blizzard

1986
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:49,080
has been applying their help to the first batch of premium maps which include arc star from creator

1987
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:54,640
pirate and direct strike from Taya I almost said Tyra but that would be a whole different

1988
02:17:54,640 --> 02:18:02,160
conversation let's not go there anyhow both these maps will cost $4.99 direct strike will actually

1989
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:07,960
have a free and a premium version premium is going to include four new modes and special cosmetics we

1990
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:13,360
don't know the patch for Starcraft 2's 4.3 patch we don't the date for it yet but hopefully it's

1991
02:18:13,360 --> 02:18:20,200
going to be soon and not like next year so there you go that feature now finally coming to Starcraft

1992
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:24,640
2 it feels like it's too late for me but at the same time there's still lots of people playing

1993
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:29,480
Starcraft and loving Starcraft and the arcade mode was like one of the best things about Starcraft 2

1994
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:34,600
so it's interesting that's still going all this years in fact Starcraft 2 went free to play at

1995
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:38,760
some point right that was a big thing last year so I mean you can check out the arcade apparently

1996
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:43,920
for free so but then of course you can you know buy this stuff if you want as to 100 Matt says

1997
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:48,640
they will just make skins tags and so forth level based they will just gain those whenever they

1998
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:53,120
level up it will be random like the loot boxes but still encourage the player to keep playing

1999
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:59,640
that could be a loophole maybe maybe so as Joe 100 Matt thinks maybe they just won't have you

2000
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:03,280
able to buy the loot boxes anymore they'll just cut out that feature and that you'll still have

2001
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:07,360
the loot boxes through the natural progression but then how's Blizzard gonna make their money

2002
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:12,800
post I mean they could also if they wanted to just patch in a shop and you could just buy the

2003
02:19:12,800 --> 02:19:18,240
currency and buy whatever and then people be like what the fuck yeah then people will be pissed

2004
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:22,320
because Belgium has it and they don't you know I want to buy individual skin yeah so me I think

2005
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:25,840
it might probably is in blizzards best interest to either just pull out of Belgium all together

2006
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:32,760
or follow what sg100 Matt is suggesting so I mean you may have heard like different games have been

2007
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:36,480
like banned in like Germany and stuff so wouldn't be the first time that they haven't sold the game

2008
02:19:36,480 --> 02:19:41,280
in a certain region like that absolutely all right it's time to open up the Skype line you guys if you

2009
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:46,400
want to give us a call orange lounge radio on Skype all one word is the place to do it and as

2010
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:50,440
we await your calls I'll check in and see if there's any last-minute stories or other things

2011
02:19:50,440 --> 02:19:57,440
we want to get to tonight anything from dark soccer or Loki or JD even I haven't seen anything

2012
02:19:57,440 --> 02:20:06,200
come up it's really slow this week I was a little bit of a news week it is the trickle well because

2013
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:14,920
e3 is someone e3 is only about five weeks away so we got to get to this phone call here so let's

2014
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:21,840
oh it just went away so I missed it so again orange launch radio all one word on Skype if

2015
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:28,480
you want to go ahead and give us a call someone played God of War did it come through oh are you

2016
02:20:28,480 --> 02:20:32,200
playing God of War nice I haven't oh yeah I watched somebody streaming that hold on we got

2017
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:37,200
a call hi you're on orange entree who's this hey it's a regionator hey regent or what's on your

2018
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:44,840
mind um I just want to comment on that once draw your you and Loki were talking about earlier

2019
02:20:44,840 --> 02:20:51,000
where you know some music was being patched out of Grand Theft Auto 4 yeah what about all now here's

2020
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:58,440
the thing you know I can see you know don't you know no don't patching know the music out for new

2021
02:20:58,440 --> 02:21:05,960
sales because license is you know expiring I doubt they want to renew the licenses right but the

2022
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:13,640
thing is if you already have the game and the music Senate no I don't see why you should lose

2023
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:21,240
access to the music I mean well you know as long as you don't put your game online but no it's a

2024
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:28,400
good point like why should you lose access if you already own the game because you know you already

2025
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:31,960
pretty much paid for it and they got the money and that all went towards the licensing a long

2026
02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:36,400
time ago so it is a little weird because you know the way video games used to be you didn't always

2027
02:21:36,400 --> 02:21:42,480
used to patch games so it is a little a little weird I don't know if the online element is part

2028
02:21:42,480 --> 02:21:48,560
of the problem is still online but I don't think it's that at all I think it's more of just their

2029
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:52,720
current they're still selling it which is why it's an issue and they can't really just patch

2030
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:57,200
it out it's not like it's not like games used to be where it's like oh we lost our light rights

2031
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:01,000
to the music so we're gonna have different music and all the copies we sell going forward they're

2032
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:10,920
still selling digitally yeah no no granted this may not be the best analogy but I kind of like

2033
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:20,280
in this to a certain extent to the whole other OS debacle you know from a few years ago where

2034
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:25,800
they removed it on PlayStation 3 I remember that yeah I made a lot of people upset yeah I mean you

2035
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:33,520
know granted you know the other OS is an actual feature feature you know on the PlayStation 3

2036
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:43,240
you know whereas the music is just a mere element within a game but still I mean no no like you

2037
02:22:43,240 --> 02:22:51,880
guys were saying you know you but you bought the game as it was no music and all and you know I

2038
02:22:51,880 --> 02:22:58,440
feel that if you they suddenly take this away you know it's not like they're gonna compensate you

2039
02:22:58,440 --> 02:23:05,280
or anything because they let me get some comments from chat Rama and chat says you don't own the

2040
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:09,680
game you own the license to play the game and yeah I know that's always like that little like

2041
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:15,040
the footnote or whatever they get you on but at the same time it's like okay if I were to put in

2042
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:20,520
DDR max for the PlayStation 2 or something into my PlayStation 2 I wouldn't want to suddenly find

2043
02:23:20,520 --> 02:23:24,280
out that like oh half the songs I can't play anymore because the license expired you know

2044
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:28,880
like I should be able to continue to play those games basically and I've not heard of this

2045
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:34,880
happening with especially well I should say non connected music based games yeah connected music

2046
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:39,160
based games I have heard of this this happens all the time in DDR arcade sure like they'll just say

2047
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:44,120
okay well time's up on the license but it's gonna go away now but it's also usually a new mix you

2048
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:49,040
know something else is coming out no I mean it's with EMUs with with the EMUs being mandatory now

2049
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:54,920
like ace has had this happen 2013 2014 like all of the newer ones they're just like yeah time's

2050
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:59,760
up it's not in anymore it must be something in the way they license music and now right maybe

2051
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:04,600
maybe the the takeoff of games like rock band and stuff or to thank for stuff like this I don't know

2052
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:10,000
I think it's just the way IP works in the music industry and the way licensing works is just

2053
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:16,560
really complicated and it's all in the specifics of the contract in reality if you don't plug your

2054
02:24:16,560 --> 02:24:21,600
game in online you're never gonna get the patch the patches it out and honestly how long is Grand

2055
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:28,280
Theft Auto 4 been out I can't exactly see that they are probably like releasing new content for

2056
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:32,000
these games right because Grand Theft Auto 5 already happened so like there's not gonna be

2057
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:35,640
you're not gonna miss anything content wise now Grand Theft Auto 4 though still has multiplayer

2058
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:39,360
and that's probably gonna be the slippery slope if you want to continue to play multiplayer online

2059
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:45,060
you're gonna have to patch the game but if that's of no interest to you then don't patch it and you

2060
02:24:45,060 --> 02:24:52,940
will get to keep all your music easy all right well you know before I let you go because I

2061
02:24:52,940 --> 02:24:59,060
reimagine that either act after someone else who would want to call in sure what I do got a tip

2062
02:24:59,060 --> 02:25:08,140
if it news for you regarding my computer situation I'll make a very long story short it looks like I

2063
02:25:08,140 --> 02:25:18,100
could be having a video card on the way possibly by Wednesday a friend of mine from high school I

2064
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:22,840
don't want a name drop because I don't have his permission to but this is so you can play Magic

2065
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:30,620
the Gathering 2018 right well there is no 2018 the most recent one is Magic duels but there's

2066
02:25:30,620 --> 02:25:44,060
gonna be shipping me his old you know you know GTX 970 so he says he's gonna put a ship in Monday

2067
02:25:44,060 --> 02:25:49,820
and I'll probably get one say so you'll be able to do a lot with that so hey hand-me-downs they're

2068
02:25:49,820 --> 02:25:54,660
awesome they work oh oh yeah a 970 would be an upgrade on this computer that's for sure but

2069
02:25:54,660 --> 02:25:58,500
that's that's for another time all right anyway Ray Jeter I'm gonna let you go thank you so much

2070
02:25:58,500 --> 02:26:03,620
have a good one yep you too take care all right bye orange on radio all one word on Skype if you

2071
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:09,540
want to get through and give us a call let's see SSG 100 Matt says there's a person on Twitter with

2072
02:26:09,540 --> 02:26:13,780
this whole game gear thing claiming to know the person who bought the game they bought it from a

2073
02:26:13,780 --> 02:26:21,060
half-price books in Wisconsin a chain of stores there I can't have price but I can't believe I've

2074
02:26:21,060 --> 02:26:26,820
never bought any video games at a half price we've got one in Roosevelt isn't it a use I just can't

2075
02:26:26,820 --> 02:26:31,700
they do get some new content in I just can't believe this is like the fucking like like

2076
02:26:31,700 --> 02:26:36,700
mystery of the century going on here it's just blows my fucking mind all right anyway I think

2077
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:40,680
we have another call coming in so let's get to it if Skype will cooperate with me higher on orange

2078
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:45,380
launch radio who's this hey what's going on everyone it's Ron hey Rama what's up buddy not

2079
02:26:45,380 --> 02:26:51,740
much I am running at full cylinders right now so I got you guys on the speakers I'm currently in the

2080
02:26:51,740 --> 02:26:57,420
chat I got Lightroom going editing photos I got my heater going because even for 56 degrees in

2081
02:26:57,420 --> 02:27:02,180
New York it's still cold in my little subterranean apartment and I'm going through stuff getting

2082
02:27:02,180 --> 02:27:08,020
ready for this week's podcast I love it love it were you at a convention this weekend no I did

2083
02:27:08,020 --> 02:27:13,900
something that was I thought was a lot better the convention is this weekend this weekend was

2084
02:27:13,900 --> 02:27:20,860
normally or say last weekend whatever it's our Sakura Matsuri but right it costs like 40 bucks

2085
02:27:20,860 --> 02:27:27,980
to get in we charge you guys yes most Sakura Matsuri events they charge you to get in oh I'm

2086
02:27:27,980 --> 02:27:36,300
you're on the wrong not not in California these coast ones they charge because what started out

2087
02:27:36,300 --> 02:27:42,540
as a normal event has become an over glorified convention I mean you pay 40 bucks to go into

2088
02:27:42,540 --> 02:27:49,300
the Botanical Gardens you've got panels on j-pop j-rock cosplay Lolita okay so this they're doing

2089
02:27:49,380 --> 02:27:54,140
a convention like a mini convention out of it what's up there's any cosplay yeah there's there's

2090
02:27:54,140 --> 02:27:57,900
a Sakura Matsuri here and you get to walk in a parade and be afraid there's a lot of free stuff

2091
02:27:57,900 --> 02:28:02,540
here but to be fair they do like concerts and things around the same time cuz didn't you and

2092
02:28:02,540 --> 02:28:08,100
um your your pal go to the taiko drum thing and that we didn't know that one though that money

2093
02:28:08,100 --> 02:28:13,500
goes back into the Taiko group special thing the Northern California cherry blossom festival which

2094
02:28:13,500 --> 02:28:19,580
was in San Francisco the past two weeks does concerts also yeah so and those are free they

2095
02:28:19,580 --> 02:28:24,240
have here they're arguing and some pay things but they're the type of thing you you expect to pay

2096
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:29,420
money to go to God likes like the food vendors and whatnot yeah that's right anyway sorry no

2097
02:28:29,420 --> 02:28:36,740
problem I mean yeah that's basically what it's become so instead of doing that I went to it a

2098
02:28:36,740 --> 02:28:43,260
ramen street festival and dropped $40 there and the food was so good good times that sounds good

2099
02:28:43,260 --> 02:28:52,780
what'd you get um I had fish ramen I had ultimate um and to ultimate ramen um taste one was called

2100
02:28:52,780 --> 02:28:58,100
championship ramen and I forget the name of the other one but I did post it on my Facebook but

2101
02:28:58,100 --> 02:29:07,140
one thing that did happen will make um Jamie squee like nobody else's business more or less please go

2102
02:29:07,140 --> 02:29:14,020
for it elaborate so I James you know I have a ronma what have hard battle t-shirt that I wear yes

2103
02:29:14,020 --> 02:29:19,900
so I'm walking around you know filming you know doing a Facebook live with me walking up and down

2104
02:29:19,900 --> 02:29:26,100
the block and then I see some and I noticed a lot of Japanese workers who came from Japan for this

2105
02:29:26,100 --> 02:29:31,740
notice the shirt and pointed out I was at one booth and I found myself getting excited because

2106
02:29:31,740 --> 02:29:36,940
a lot of people there knew the shirt knew the characters I always started singing the opening

2107
02:29:37,740 --> 02:29:43,020
right there spot that's cute that's awesome yeah I have to quickly say though on ramen since you

2108
02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:47,660
brought up food my favorite to order when I go to the restaurant is a curry ramen that's always my

2109
02:29:47,660 --> 02:29:55,740
favorite always black garlic tonkatsu for me but what's interesting so this near where I work here

2110
02:29:55,740 --> 02:30:01,100
in Sacramento there's been this Chinese restaurant that's been there for years like he's at least 10

2111
02:30:01,100 --> 02:30:06,380
years probably 15 years it closed kind of out of nowhere and I'm a little sad about it but at the

2112
02:30:06,380 --> 02:30:11,260
same time a ramen joint is replacing it so I'm kind of like well okay that happened to the pokey

2113
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:17,500
place near my house I kind of think pokies overrated I don't know it's nice to have something

2114
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:22,580
that I that I can eat yeah no no I understand but pokies becoming like frozen yogurt like there's

2115
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:28,220
just too many places it's super trendy it yeah it's replacing I'm not saying we should like eliminate

2116
02:30:28,220 --> 02:30:33,340
all the poke in the world but it's you know we got to scale it back although speaking of frozen

2117
02:30:33,340 --> 02:30:37,100
yogurt places you may not have heard this new star sorry to hijack your call Rama but this

2118
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:42,860
happens cool uh dark soccer I don't know if you heard about this yogurt land the place that had

2119
02:30:42,860 --> 02:30:49,100
the Nintendo tie-ins here the one here locally gone it closed that sucks I know it fucking sucks

2120
02:30:49,100 --> 02:30:54,580
you still have pink bury which you know is the good old OLR standby but we have a new one we

2121
02:30:54,580 --> 02:30:58,820
relate to like to go to call Menchie's which I think I think they have those oh I think I saw

2122
02:30:58,820 --> 02:31:02,620
Menchie's when I was traveling so I think they're all over wait wait wait wait wait hold up hold up

2123
02:31:02,620 --> 02:31:08,900
did you say yogurt land yeah yeah it's a chain we had one out here in lower Manhattan that's been

2124
02:31:08,900 --> 02:31:12,580
closed for over a year and I never got you has to check it out because they put a sign saying

2125
02:31:12,580 --> 02:31:19,380
they're renovating next thing you know it's gone yeah I mean we we have a pink berry we have 16

2126
02:31:19,380 --> 02:31:24,940
handles far as I know the closest Menchie is somewhere out on Long Island but you know yeah

2127
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:29,300
that's I just I like the crazy flavors I don't know I got to admit pink berry I'm not as big

2128
02:31:29,300 --> 02:31:34,180
on it as I used to be because I think a lot of the flavors like every time they get a flavor I

2129
02:31:34,180 --> 02:31:39,660
really like it never comes back and so I'm I kind of get annoyed by that I don't like how the pink

2130
02:31:39,660 --> 02:31:44,820
berry doesn't let you do your own toppings now it's like the the killer for me yeah they have

2131
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:50,100
some good stuff but I think I think I kind of kind of drifted more towards that you get to make it

2132
02:31:50,100 --> 02:31:54,780
yourself that's probably Alan's influence Alan never really liked that either Alan was more big

2133
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:59,300
on the other do-it-yourself let's not eat it pink berry I got sick but I think it was the Nutella

2134
02:31:59,300 --> 02:32:04,260
I've got to say though every time we go to Menchie's I just can't stop thinking of the

2135
02:32:04,260 --> 02:32:12,820
emergency rations in Excel saga all right Rama I have a Menchie hat I know I hijacked your call

2136
02:32:12,820 --> 02:32:16,380
but anything else you want to share with us tonight before we let you go I will cut down

2137
02:32:16,380 --> 02:32:21,740
my topics to two all right number one you talked about my space at the beginning of the show yeah

2138
02:32:21,740 --> 02:32:27,620
there is there is an article that's been floating around about my space about some of the craziness

2139
02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:32,460
one one of them in there they talk about the top eight there's always a fight about the top eight

2140
02:32:32,460 --> 02:32:37,260
and I think this was a BuzzFeed article yeah whenever this floats around that top eight I

2141
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:41,940
know six of the people on that top eight because I was friends I'm still friends with that person's

2142
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:48,700
but that was on myspace yeah I don't even remember who is in my top eight I really don't I feel like

2143
02:32:48,700 --> 02:32:53,540
olr started around that time so I probably had Janie in the top eight probably Loki if he was

2144
02:32:53,540 --> 02:33:01,020
even on myspace on you remember I had my music stuff on there oh you sure did I know I had you

2145
02:33:01,020 --> 02:33:09,880
and she who shall not be named uh-huh um yeah yeah I don't I don't even remember anymore so I I have

2146
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:13,260
no idea who is in my top eight I wasn't dating Alan then so he wouldn't have been in the top

2147
02:33:13,260 --> 02:33:18,220
eight maybe whoever I was taking at the time it was a long time ago but yeah I can't even remember

2148
02:33:18,380 --> 02:33:22,300
it would be fun to go back and see though because yeah who knows if I'm even still friends with those

2149
02:33:22,300 --> 02:33:28,100
people as sad as it is I think I deleted mine oh yeah I did too so I wouldn't be able to know well

2150
02:33:28,100 --> 02:33:33,100
then at some point you were able to expand it to like a top 24 so that's what I did yeah just used

2151
02:33:33,100 --> 02:33:37,580
to be able to write code inject code in here to make it like your top 100 you know what I think

2152
02:33:37,580 --> 02:33:43,700
I did I think I made my top eight so that it wasn't so competitive I think I made my top eight like

2153
02:33:43,700 --> 02:33:50,700
Abba and Alanis Morissette and it was like all the like bands and stuff so I I didn't have to

2154
02:33:50,700 --> 02:33:55,940
play that ugly rank your friends game Rob forget forget the rest of the topics I want to talk about

2155
02:33:55,940 --> 02:34:04,500
tonight what's on Abba coming back we haven't I opened up that door didn't I stay tuned to this

2156
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:10,220
week shaking and crying and yes there will be a new episode this week but I Lord Jesus I don't

2157
02:34:10,300 --> 02:34:14,340
want to ruin it but all I will say is that the title is appropriate didn't you just have a

2158
02:34:14,340 --> 02:34:22,980
musical episode yes yes that's that's all I can say Rama I'm sorry that's cool cuz my first one

2159
02:34:22,980 --> 02:34:27,800
article I was like oh my god I have to tell her I gotta tell you were the first to put it on my

2160
02:34:27,800 --> 02:34:31,860
page for what it's worth when I roll that a baby probably you had the East Coast advantage here

2161
02:34:31,860 --> 02:34:36,140
because when I rolled out of bed it was like Rama shared an article with you and if you were the

2162
02:34:36,140 --> 02:34:41,420
first to post it and then like it I kid you not that article got posted to my Facebook page at

2163
02:34:41,420 --> 02:34:47,300
least five times and one of them was Jamie which but but like I think I responded to Jamie's I'm

2164
02:34:47,300 --> 02:34:52,820
like yeah I woke up saw it yeah no which which again I put I love that I'm getting tied to this

2165
02:34:52,820 --> 02:34:58,300
all the time but I'm not being sarcastic like I'm actually really touched that people when they

2166
02:34:58,300 --> 02:35:03,140

2177
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:19,700
top I deleted my myspace that's right so I may have been in your top eight and I got bounced

2178
02:36:19,700 --> 02:36:24,420
out when I deleted it I do have a last-minute story all right go for it so the switch has

2179
02:36:24,500 --> 02:36:35,940
been hacked finally oh so it's been hacked in the craziest part about this hack it's unpatchable so

2180
02:36:35,940 --> 02:36:42,420
the way it's involves a flaw in the switches Tegra processor their USB recovery mode which

2181
02:36:42,420 --> 02:36:48,380
can't be patched it just cannot be patched anymore so already two hacking groups have allowed users

2182
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:55,700
to jailbreak the switch and even run a ported version of Linux on the system and to actually

2183
02:36:55,700 --> 02:37:00,580
access it I mean it's like super easy basically create like a little dongle thing that hooks up

2184
02:37:00,580 --> 02:37:05,340
to the side of it and you can do it actually with a paperclip if you have it formatted just right

2185
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:12,820
but it's just so crazy that already we've this has happened and it's unpatchable so it'll be

2186
02:37:12,820 --> 02:37:20,220
interesting to see what happens from here interesting especially to see whatever they

2187
02:37:20,220 --> 02:37:25,020
announced next oh my god Jamie is this your own myspace picture that you just linked in chat yep

2188
02:37:25,020 --> 02:37:29,820
and also I linked another one of you and me on Space Mountain oh Jesus was my old crappy phone

2189
02:37:29,820 --> 02:37:35,700
so it's all blurry as shit so the so for the sake of our radio people this is a picture of Jamie

2190
02:37:35,700 --> 02:37:39,300
standing in front of Space Mountain and she's looking happy which of course she would be because

2191
02:37:39,300 --> 02:37:44,060
she's about to go on fucking that was rockin Space Mountain so that's 2000 fucking six oh shit

launch radio who's this hey this act up yeah buddy good to hear from you well I have a last

2201
02:38:34,700 --> 02:38:41,060
minute story for you involving Kirby Star Allies oh yes yes that JD is a fan of this game what

2202
02:38:41,060 --> 02:38:51,220
would you like to say well they that a mining data mining mines sorry that the bill and basically

2203
02:38:51,220 --> 02:38:56,780
they found more DLC characters that are coming to the game and it's pretty exciting okay what

2204
02:38:56,780 --> 02:39:06,180
kind of characters probably two other waves that the first one would be Adeline from Kirby 64 mm-hmm

2205
02:39:06,180 --> 02:39:18,140
also I forgot the name Oh row road Roach the Roach sorry that Roach from Kirby's quick squat and

2206
02:39:18,140 --> 02:39:28,460
also Dark Meta Knight too and there's also a third DLC probably with with the gem Bastion

2207
02:39:28,460 --> 02:39:38,700
the sisters or mages from Kirby Star Allies okay there's also one other Megalor from Kirby return

2208
02:39:38,700 --> 02:39:46,540
to dreamland and another character which I forgot god damn ah Susie from Kirby planet robot so and

2209
02:39:46,540 --> 02:39:51,500
also Terenza from Kirby triple deluxe so look forward to all those amiibo coming soon as well

2210
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:59,980
yes dark soccer is actually wearing a Kirby shirt tonight and earlier in the show I know you weren't

2211
02:39:59,980 --> 02:40:03,220
here for the first 30 minutes but be sure to go back and listen to it because I thought dark

2212
02:40:03,220 --> 02:40:08,340
soccer was telling me about a Kirby drag outfit she was planning but it turns out she said a Kirby

2213
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:13,580
and I was like oh act F's gonna be so disappointed I thought it was a Kirby drag outfit you know I

2214
02:40:13,580 --> 02:40:18,940
could probably put something together I'm pretty handy with some hot glue yes I know I know I'll do

2215
02:40:18,940 --> 02:40:23,020
a Meta Knight one well that'd be fun so you're enjoying the Kirby of course you're enjoying the

2216
02:40:23,020 --> 02:40:31,420
Kirby switch game of course I already finished it so I I'm pretty excited about the new content and

2217
02:40:31,420 --> 02:40:39,180
having more characters though I do wish the game had a little more expansion to it mm-hmm since it's

2218
02:40:39,380 --> 02:40:48,180
it is kind of short and all that stuff but the game is if if anybody is still considering getting

2219
02:40:48,180 --> 02:40:55,020
it I really recommend it especially playing with friends yeah that game is so much fun with friends

2220
02:40:55,020 --> 02:41:00,420
so way too much fun how about that another party game that Nintendo has done successfully yeah

2221
02:41:00,420 --> 02:41:05,740
that's not a read that's a real like they just always seem to do that I finished the game when

2222
02:41:05,740 --> 02:41:09,580
I had a bunch of friends over and it was it was a lot of fun but it also made it a lot easier

2223
02:41:09,580 --> 02:41:17,080
because you can use the special characters and they're super overpowered like the the one guy

2224
02:41:17,080 --> 02:41:22,140
from Kirby superstar like lets you rain down bomb confetti or something and it just decimated

2225
02:41:22,140 --> 02:41:27,740
everything it was great yeah marks Marcus is overpowered also gooey it's like really fun to

2226
02:41:27,740 --> 02:41:33,220
use yeah all right well act after I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up but thank you for the

02:43:43,700 --> 02:43:50,100

2254
02:43:50,100 --> 02:43:57,980
tonight is I I'm still full from brunch man that's the downside of the great tradition of gay Sunday

2255
02:43:57,980 --> 02:44:03,540
brunch is that I'm still full actually if I may bring this up all right faces is now doing a

2256
02:44:03,540 --> 02:44:08,900

2257
02:44:08,900 --> 02:44:15,820
if people want to go mmm if I'm here yeah cool all right last but not least Loki your final thought

2258
02:44:15,820 --> 02:44:21,620
tonight my final thought is I have to figure out whether there's switch games to get I'm looking

2259
02:44:21,620 --> 02:44:25,740
for more local multiplayer stuff because my son's having some friends over and they need more

2260
02:44:25,740 --> 02:44:29,420
four-player yeah you have to look into the online stuff the big library of indie games there's got

2261
02:44:29,420 --> 02:44:33,940
to be some good stuff in there yeah jackbox and I'm just kidding they're too young for that but

2262
02:44:33,940 --> 02:44:36,980
yeah they wouldn't you probably don't want the kids playing trivia murder party it's probably

2263
02:44:36,980 --> 02:44:42,780
a little soon for that yeah yeah probably all right anyway Oh Loki suggests Kirby star allies

2264
02:44:42,780 --> 02:44:49,460
there you go well that is a cute cute kid game and yeah you know he wants Mario Party but I

2265
02:44:49,460 --> 02:44:54,020
don't think there's any Mario Party games tonight yet oh yeah I would say that's a guarantee for e3

2266
02:44:54,020 --> 02:44:59,940
but we'll see we'll see anyway we'll find out as we get closer and closer to e3 next week here
