Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Soon you can earn Xbox achievements on your Nintendo Switch. No really, it's so weird.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
And the gaming world turns with years old gaming high score drama taking a big twist this week.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
We get into all this and more this week on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, April 15th of 2018.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Don't forget your taxes here in the US, even though you have until the 17th.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
But anyway, episode 726 of our show with myself, Rob Roberts.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
And by my side as she always is, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
This beverage is amazing.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
What are you drinking over there?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
It's the peppermint cocoa.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Oh that chocolate truffle thing. I don't even remember where I got it now.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
It's delicious and it makes me feel happy to be alive.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Even though they're not paying us, I will give a shout out to Keurig.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Because those machines have changed my life.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Except Keurig can go suck on an egg for that whole DRM with the coffee.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
But I think that's kind of in the past now.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I think they figured that they kind of can't win with that.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
You know what?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
What?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
I use a drip.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Not a machine.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
I have a cup that I put a filter in.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, you do old school.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I do old school coffee.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
You don't even have a percolator.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I do have a percolator.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
You do have a percolator.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
I have a Pyrex percolator from 1958.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
There you go.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
That's good. Yeah.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
My granny told me two months before she died, never get rid of it.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
And I'm saying good to that.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
It will go to my grave.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Good for you.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
No, I was at Easter Sunday at my family, my aunt and uncle.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
And their coffee percolator is probably from the 50s as well.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
And it was one of those, like, I had a moment where I was using it.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
I was like, wow, I don't remember the last time I had coffee out of a percolator.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Like, you know, everything now, even at the restaurants,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
everything is like that just, you know, flowing through the filter.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
You know, just the giant machine.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
That's how the work machines work.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
That's how Starbucks really does, you know, most of their stuff.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
So just like, wow, a percolator.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
The only other way that I will get it that is really, really good too.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
And it deserves a shout out.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
And I know this isn't a coffee podcast.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
It's a video game podcast.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
But let's be real.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I drink a lot of coffee when I stay up late playing video games.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
French press.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
I have a couple of French presses.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
In fact, if you want my extra, you can have it.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Oh, we have one.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
But it's just that there's something so satisfying about the plunger.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
It was the French.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Well, I have two things on my list to get from Michael.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Now, keep in mind, I can't have caffeine anymore.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
So it's all decaf for me.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Right.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
But I want a mocha pot, which is basically like an Italian percolator.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
That's metal and has the two sides it uses and a siphon.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Both of them use the same, you know, theory.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
A percolator does because it uses vacuum pressure.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
It's science, but coffee.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Coffee and science.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
What a way to wake up.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
That would be a good name of a Facebook page I would like.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
It is science, but coffee.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Stimulating for body and mind.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Right.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Say hello to the ever stimulating comments from tech master Loki.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Science.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Stimulating or scintillating.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
How are you, Loki?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Little column A, little column B.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
How many times have you seen Ready Player One at this point?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Just twice.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Just twice?

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
No, I can't get out to the theaters every weekend because kids and wife.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
It's just like, yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
What a life.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
What a life.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
You're falling behind.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
Shane is on, I think, seven viewings of Love, Simon, and we're going with him tonight after

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
the show.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Late movie tonight.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Is good.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I don't know.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
I mean, I totally see it again.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Have you ever seen a movie that many times in the theater?

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
I saw Independence Day every single day up to Independence Day.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
So, like, we actually got to see like, it was like three or four days in a row.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Welcome to Earth.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
That movie was classic.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I never bothered to see the sequel.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Tell me the sequel was...

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
The sequel was terrible.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Don't see the sequel.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
In fact, I don't think I watched the sequel, but I've heard it's terrible.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Let me quickly, I want to say hi to the chat room over at live.vog.network.com because

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
after Bobby Black Wolf at The Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Although it is a, it's a little bit of a weird week.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
SSG100Matt said classic Rob intro in our chat room.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
And yeah, it was, it was my voice in the intro tonight because Jason has the night off.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
He's traveling.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Bobby Black Wolf was not here tonight.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
He's at a Weird Al concert, which let's be real is a great reason.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
I'm going through the same one next month.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Oh yeah.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Cause he's touring.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
At the Crest.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Science.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Anyway, uh, let me ask the chatters and you guys here in studio, what is the movie you've

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
seen the most number of times in the theater like that?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
What are you doing?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I don't think about it.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
No counting the Rocky Hort picture show.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Well, that's too easy.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
That's too easy.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
That's too easy.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
That's my obvious answer.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
I've seen Return of the Jedi a total of eight times in the theater.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
Three of them when it first came out because I saw it with various family members and five

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
times as an adult with the re-release.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Okay.

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
Um, I've also seen all of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, the original three, four

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
times in the theater each.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
I've seen Bill and Taz Bogus Journey six times in the theater.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Seen Pump Up the volume four times in the theater.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
I've seen Tron six times.

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
Um, I saw, um, uh, the Phantom Menace twice.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
Actually, I saw, um, the last one twice already.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
You sat through the Phantom Menace twice?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Not the Phantom Menace.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Why am I saying the Phantom Menace?

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
I meant, um, the last Jedi wakes up from his nap.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Oh, episode seven.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Basically.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Yeah.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
But, um, gosh, I've seen, I think I've seen Gremlins.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
No, I take that back.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I've seen Ghostbusters 10 times in the theaters.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
So I think that is the one I've seen the most.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Wow.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
Cause I saw it a few times as a kid and then it went to the cheap movie and I saw it there

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
and then, um, I've seen it three more times as an adult on Halloween showings.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Let's see.

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
For me, um, all that comes to mind is other cult movies because I've seen Repo, the genetic

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
opera, like easily like 20, 25 times.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
I don't think that counts too.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
If you've done shadow cast.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah, I know.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
It's like the shadow, like even I'm like shock treatment.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I've probably seen a good six or seven theater.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Yeah.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.800
But that's also, and it's, it's, it's, I had to see it that many times to finally appreciate

06:21.800 --> 06:25.600
the movie because if you don't know what shock treatment is, it's the quote unquote, it's

06:25.600 --> 06:29.600
not the sequel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but it's like the, what if these characters

06:29.600 --> 06:31.600
were in a different place in a different time type of thing?

06:31.600 --> 06:35.200
It's, it's, it's really high concept, but here's the American horror story of the, it

06:35.200 --> 06:36.200
is, it is.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.960
It's like, okay, that's actually a perfect way to describe it.

06:37.960 --> 06:41.360
It's American horror story, but like the second like chapter first time I saw that

06:41.360 --> 06:45.040
was when Evan was living with Jessica and he made those cookies.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.040
Yes.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.120
Here's the thing about shock treatment though.

06:47.120 --> 06:52.260
It's like a parody of reality television made in 1981.

06:52.260 --> 06:56.040
Like actually the movie would like now in retrospect was actually like really, really

06:56.040 --> 06:59.860
ahead of its time and it has a really good soundtrack, almost like it's a parody of let's

06:59.860 --> 07:00.860
make a deal.

07:00.860 --> 07:01.860
Kinda.

07:01.860 --> 07:03.760
I mean, the audience and everything.

07:03.760 --> 07:04.760
Yeah.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.540
And you get to see Dame Edna, but like not as Dame Edna.

07:07.540 --> 07:11.920
Like Dame Edna as, I don't even remember, Barry Humphries, you see Dame Edna as Barry

07:11.920 --> 07:13.300
Humphries in that movie.

07:13.300 --> 07:18.740
So and Ruby Wax, like all these like, like they're more known like, like obviously Dame

07:18.740 --> 07:21.240
Edna is what Australia, Ruby Wax UK.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.380
So like a lot of people here in the US don't know, although Ruby Wax had a show on Fox

07:24.380 --> 07:25.380
in the nineties.

07:25.380 --> 07:26.380
Do you remember the Ruby Wax show?

07:26.380 --> 07:27.380
I remember the Ruby Wax show.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.220
Anyway, this is really obscured.

07:30.220 --> 07:31.640
I remember the RuPaul show though.

07:31.640 --> 07:33.540
It's going to be one of those nights.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.420
I saw Kung Pao maybe four times in the theaters.

07:36.420 --> 07:37.420
Okay.

07:37.420 --> 07:38.420
There you go.

07:38.420 --> 07:39.420
There you go.

07:39.420 --> 07:40.420
What about Kung Fury?

07:40.420 --> 07:41.420
I saw that one time in the theater.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.620
Oh, I have seen, um, hot fuzz four times in the theater.

07:44.620 --> 07:45.620
The only, okay.

07:45.620 --> 07:48.660
The non cold movies that come to mind, I saw, don't tease me.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.140
Do not tease me.

07:50.140 --> 07:52.660
I saw Titanic three times in the theater.

07:52.660 --> 07:55.780
Do you want to know how I saw Titanic?

07:55.780 --> 07:56.780
How?

07:56.780 --> 07:57.780
On a boat?

07:57.780 --> 07:59.740
I think that's, that's the way to see it.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.660
I wish I had gone down with that boat.

08:01.660 --> 08:02.660
No.

08:02.900 --> 08:07.620
We had a, um, an Emmy's viewing tape bootleg.

08:07.620 --> 08:08.860
Oh, okay.

08:08.860 --> 08:09.860
And that's how I saw it.

08:09.860 --> 08:10.860
What Emmy's?

08:10.860 --> 08:11.860
You mean Oscars?

08:11.860 --> 08:12.860
Oscar, sorry, whatever.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.740
An Oscars, um, uh, pre-release viewing thing.

08:15.740 --> 08:18.780
So it was while it was still in the theater, but we had that and it was the same night

08:18.780 --> 08:19.780
I saw American beauty.

08:19.780 --> 08:20.780
It was weird.

08:20.780 --> 08:21.780
Okay.

08:21.780 --> 08:24.820
So that movie came out when I was in college and I had a lot of lady friends that wanted

08:24.820 --> 08:28.980
to see it repeatedly because that, by the way, to answer Tiger call's question as to

08:28.980 --> 08:33.420
how many times I've seen Howard the Duck as a kid and, um, twice.

08:33.420 --> 08:37.500
That movie, like when we was Titanic, I don't think I've ever sat through the whole thing

08:37.500 --> 08:41.860
because like I remember that was like back in the day via the company I used to work

08:41.860 --> 08:45.180
at the previous company that was like a video distributor or whatever.

08:45.180 --> 08:49.620
My dad actually, he used to deliver to that company even before I ever got there.

08:49.620 --> 08:50.860
I was still in high school.

08:50.860 --> 08:53.620
So he used to get the screeners for movies and stuff.

08:53.620 --> 08:56.140
So that's how he got Titanic to watch it.

08:56.140 --> 08:57.140
Oh my God.

08:57.140 --> 08:59.820
It's like such a soul sucking, boring ass movie.

08:59.820 --> 09:05.220
Like I just like after the first day I'm like, I can't, I cannot do this much cooler.

09:05.220 --> 09:07.620
I saw Tron legacy three times in the theater.

09:07.620 --> 09:09.700
So that is my better answer.

09:09.700 --> 09:10.700
Yeah.

09:10.700 --> 09:11.700
Ties.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.900
Ties a little more into video games, but I do want to read some of the answers in our

09:13.900 --> 09:16.700
chat over at live dot vog network.com.

09:16.700 --> 09:20.340
Dungeon buster says I almost never see a movie twice in the theater unless it's really something

09:20.340 --> 09:23.780
I've enjoyed and someone who hasn't seen it wants to go.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.220
Same with the exception of Tron legacy.

09:25.220 --> 09:26.980
I just wanted to see that a million times.

09:26.980 --> 09:29.420
Um, Oh, can I count that Muppet movie?

09:29.420 --> 09:30.420
How about captain EO?

09:30.420 --> 09:31.420
I've seen captain EO.

09:31.420 --> 09:32.420
Yeah.

09:32.420 --> 09:33.420
Captain EO.

09:33.420 --> 09:36.060
I've seen a bunch of times easily.

09:36.060 --> 09:37.060
Yeah.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.060
I fucking love captain EO.

09:38.060 --> 09:39.060
Okay.

09:39.060 --> 09:41.220
Um, go going back to the real answers in the chat.

09:41.220 --> 09:44.700
Uh, SGL and her mat also says Ghostbusters five times to the theater.

09:44.700 --> 09:47.460
Dungeon buster says, I can't remember how many times I've rewatched Raiders of the Lost

09:47.460 --> 09:48.460
Ark.

09:48.460 --> 09:49.460
Uh, let's see.

09:49.460 --> 09:50.780
But it has to be in a theater.

09:50.780 --> 09:53.580
Act F says the first Avengers are the first guardians of the galaxy.

09:53.580 --> 09:55.980
I think I saw those movies three or four times in the theater.

09:55.980 --> 09:58.380
Uh, active says Shrek as well.

09:58.380 --> 10:01.460
Uh, SJ says, what about guilty pleasure?

10:01.460 --> 10:02.460
Multiple showings.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.300
I saw anger management three times in the theater.

10:04.300 --> 10:08.220
Fifth dream says I saw Terminator two twice on the same day.

10:08.220 --> 10:09.220
That's pretty good.

10:09.220 --> 10:10.220
Okay.

10:10.220 --> 10:11.220
That's pretty good.

10:11.220 --> 10:12.220
All right.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.220
Anyway.

10:13.220 --> 10:14.220
Uh, great.

10:14.220 --> 10:15.220
I love it.

10:15.220 --> 10:16.220
Uh, thank you for the answers over in our chat.

10:16.220 --> 10:21.020
We're talking in a theater, live.vognetwork.com that you have to go in and sit and look at

10:21.020 --> 10:23.460
a screen that's the size of your house.

10:23.460 --> 10:24.460
Yes.

10:24.460 --> 10:25.460
All right.

10:25.460 --> 10:26.460
Yes.

10:26.460 --> 10:30.860
Well, not necessarily like the art house theater in Chico when I lived there for a few years

10:30.860 --> 10:36.220
probably was somebody's house and the screen was probably as big as this television that's

10:36.220 --> 10:38.380
in our living room or in our studio.

10:38.380 --> 10:47.580
I mean, I've also, my, my church had return of the Jedi on a full reel with a projector.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.580
Nice.

10:48.580 --> 10:49.580
When I was a kid.

10:49.580 --> 10:50.580
Was I saw it a bunch that time.

10:50.580 --> 10:53.780
Did they have like the safe for church version or something?

10:53.780 --> 10:54.780
I don't even know.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.220
It's not like that movie was very bad anyway.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.220
Was it?

10:57.220 --> 10:58.220
It wasn't.

10:58.220 --> 10:59.220
I didn't want to leave.

10:59.220 --> 11:03.220
I just know sometimes movies had like the safe for, you know, or the, the G rated cut

11:03.220 --> 11:04.220
or whatever.

11:04.220 --> 11:05.220
You know what I say to that?

11:05.220 --> 11:12.880
Oh God, the show girls VH one edit is great where they draw on all the bras.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.880
That is my favorite.

11:13.880 --> 11:14.880
Yeah.

11:14.880 --> 11:15.880
It's like that.

11:15.880 --> 11:19.620
Was it, um, safe for work porn thing that they have, you know, where they do like the

11:19.620 --> 11:21.420
like Microsoft paint stuff.

11:21.420 --> 11:22.420
All right.

11:22.420 --> 11:26.380
Anyway, look, uh, we talk about video games once in a while here on this show.

11:26.380 --> 11:27.380
Okay.

11:27.380 --> 11:31.220
From movies, I'm going to go to music because for our kickoff topic tonight, I've had a

11:31.220 --> 11:35.220
little bit of Coachella on the brain this weekend because I don't know about you guys,

11:35.220 --> 11:38.380
but my Twitter timeline last night was lit the fuck up.

11:38.380 --> 11:42.060
Just remember the owner of Coachella supports anti LGBT.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.060
I understand.

11:43.060 --> 11:49.420
However, it needs to be said that Beyonce, the queen of pop basically lit the fuck up

11:49.420 --> 11:51.140
out of that event last night.

11:51.140 --> 11:55.940
So shady dealings aside and all that, it's what people are talking about.

11:55.940 --> 12:00.820
And I want to think about video game concerts and video game music and you know, going to

12:00.820 --> 12:03.480
see stuff for video games live.

12:03.480 --> 12:06.340
So I'm kind of asking a couple of questions here tonight.

12:06.340 --> 12:10.660
The first one would be, do you have any good like video game concerts that you've been

12:10.660 --> 12:11.660
to?

12:11.660 --> 12:12.660
Video game related things.

12:12.660 --> 12:15.860
Um, you know, it could be an actual video games concert.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.020
Like, um, let's see.

12:17.020 --> 12:21.060
I remember going with announcer Jason here at OLR.

12:21.060 --> 12:24.660
We went, it was the first E3 I think I ever went to and he was there too.

12:24.660 --> 12:28.580
And we went to go see the final fantasy live concert.

12:28.580 --> 12:29.580
Was it dear?

12:29.580 --> 12:30.580
Yeah.

12:30.580 --> 12:31.580
It was dear friends.

12:31.580 --> 12:32.580
You were there too.

12:32.580 --> 12:33.940
No, Jason and I went one year.

12:33.940 --> 12:36.020
Didn't we go to more friends?

12:36.020 --> 12:37.020
I don't remember.

12:37.020 --> 12:38.020
It's Final Fantasy though.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.020
Did we all go?

12:39.020 --> 12:40.020
Maybe we all did.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.020
I don't know.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.020
I saw video games live.

12:42.020 --> 12:43.340
Is that the universal thing?

12:43.340 --> 12:44.980
No, that was more friends.

12:44.980 --> 12:46.340
Friends was at universal.

12:46.340 --> 12:50.100
That was, and that wasn't as good, but dear friends was the first year at the Walt Disney

12:50.100 --> 12:55.060
Symphony hall that, that we would, I'm positive with that with Jason because I've seen video

12:55.060 --> 12:56.060
games live.

12:56.060 --> 12:59.420
I remember we were sitting right next to Nobui Matsu and we had no idea.

12:59.420 --> 13:01.500
We're like, why is this seat like all taped up and everything?

13:01.500 --> 13:03.820
And they're like, Oh, Nobui Matsu comes in the theater and sits right next to us.

13:03.820 --> 13:06.460
And I was like, okay, that's a thing that just happened.

13:06.460 --> 13:09.100
Um, but anyway, uh, that was, that was great.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.180
Live symphony.

13:10.180 --> 13:13.060
And uh, my other like symphony story would be video games live.

13:13.140 --> 13:18.340
Uh, when I saw that, when it came through Oakland, uh, that was actually the first time

13:18.340 --> 13:20.660
I ever met Alan in person.

13:20.660 --> 13:24.340
So Alan and I were friends online on live journal for years, but we, that was the first

13:24.340 --> 13:29.420
time we met in person and it was captain spike from Game Buoy who actually was like, Oh,

13:29.420 --> 13:30.580
don't you guys like know each other online?

13:30.580 --> 13:32.900
Have you ever met in person, Rob, Alan, Alan Rob.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.740
So, uh, and that was that.

13:34.740 --> 13:36.900
So yeah, that was a video game related thing.

13:36.900 --> 13:40.980
I would say another one that's, that's kind of video game related is when I was fortunate

13:40.980 --> 13:46.500
enough to see Utada Hikaru at the Fillmore in San Francisco, which is a pretty small

13:46.500 --> 13:47.500
venue.

13:47.500 --> 13:51.500
I mean, I'm pretty sure Utada Hikaru sells out much bigger venues in Japan, but getting

13:51.500 --> 13:56.180
to see her in that smaller venue in, um, which, you know, kingdom hearts, she did.

13:56.180 --> 13:59.500
If I do, if I do recall correctly, she did play simple and clean.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.400
So, um, I can say that as an answer.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.960
That was a great concert too.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.940
And I think again, I think captain spike is who I went to that with.

14:06.940 --> 14:09.220
So it's kind of funny how that all goes together.

14:09.220 --> 14:10.220
What about you guys?

14:10.300 --> 14:12.300
What like good video game concerts have you seen?

14:12.300 --> 14:13.300
I opened this up to chat as well.

14:13.300 --> 14:21.860
Got to see Mari Ijima, who was, uh, uh, Min May's voice actor in, uh, Macross back in

14:21.860 --> 14:22.860
the day.

14:22.860 --> 14:24.300
I've got to see, um, some of her concerts.

14:24.300 --> 14:30.100
I've seen a few, um, live shows at conventions, you know, just that.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.100
That's about it.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.100
Okay.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.180
Well, I saw more friends.

14:34.180 --> 14:35.820
That was it.

14:35.820 --> 14:38.840
More friends wasn't nearly as good as dear friend, like the acoustics in that place was

14:39.040 --> 14:40.040
wasn't great.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.760
So it's kind of, I think they, they never did that concert again, but the final fantasy

14:43.760 --> 14:46.680
stuff kind of like tours, it comes through different towns every now and again.

14:46.680 --> 14:47.680
So it's pretty fun.

14:47.680 --> 14:54.960
Uh, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, um, let's see, uh, I'm looking at some comments

14:54.960 --> 14:55.960
here.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.860
Some people talking about Coachella and what Jamie had said earlier, uh, as 200, Matt says,

14:58.860 --> 15:03.800
mag fest, the live performance of the journey game that they played an orchestra while someone

15:03.800 --> 15:04.800
played the game.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.800
That was cool.

15:05.800 --> 15:06.800
Yes.

15:06.800 --> 15:07.800
I was there for that too.

15:07.800 --> 15:08.800
That was one of the years I went, Matt.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.560
It was, uh, Austin Wintory was actually there directing it and people were playing the game.

15:12.560 --> 15:13.560
That was rad.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.800
I agree with you on that.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.120
Thank you for reminding me of that.

15:16.120 --> 15:20.680
Uh, fifth dream says I went to a live official Pokemon event one year and it had a live stage

15:20.680 --> 15:26.240
show with a game show kids signing a kids singing the Johto theme song and people dressed

15:26.240 --> 15:28.480
like may and some Pokemon running around.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.920
They showed an episode that wasn't out yet.

15:29.920 --> 15:30.920
Does that count?

15:30.920 --> 15:31.920
Sure.

15:31.920 --> 15:32.920
That works.

15:32.920 --> 15:33.920
I love it.

15:34.040 --> 15:39.520
Um, and as Joe and her mat also points out, a lot of my best video game related concerts

15:39.520 --> 15:40.920
have been at magfest.

15:40.920 --> 15:41.920
Okay.

15:41.920 --> 15:46.760
Now let me ask question number two, what video game concert would you like to see?

15:46.760 --> 15:49.120
And it doesn't have to be something that exists.

15:49.120 --> 15:54.480
Just is there like a dream video game related concert that you would just love to see?

15:54.480 --> 15:58.000
Like what would be your dream festival?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Dark soccer.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.080
What would be like a video game concert you would love to see?

16:01.240 --> 16:05.200
I would have liked to have been able to go to the Macross seven live concerts.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.080
Those have been great because Macross seven is probably my favorite of the Macross series

16:08.080 --> 16:10.240
and I love all the music from it.

16:10.240 --> 16:13.040
Um, but I don't, I don't really know.

16:13.040 --> 16:19.360
I mean, I've gotten to see all the concerts I've really wanted to see because I saw gorillas

16:19.360 --> 16:23.480
and there's nothing really else video game or anime or anything related that I would

16:23.480 --> 16:24.480
super want to see.

16:24.480 --> 16:30.920
I mean, if it came up to it, I would really like to have like a whole just synth pop orchestra

16:31.800 --> 16:34.960
of, you know, eight bit or 16 bit music.

16:34.960 --> 16:35.960
That would be really, really fun.

16:35.960 --> 16:36.960
What about you Logie?

16:36.960 --> 16:39.760
If we're going to get ultra ridiculous with this.

16:39.760 --> 16:40.760
Why not?

16:40.760 --> 16:44.880
Um, yeah, I'd say either like something, I would have liked to see something like a DJ

16:44.880 --> 16:50.640
hero type thing where they're, you know, mixing stuff together or we'll have like all Eurobeat,

16:50.640 --> 16:58.200
you know, what in the middle of a drift racing race, like just like just racing and Eurobeat

16:58.200 --> 16:59.200
music.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.560
Nice track and Eurobeat.

17:00.560 --> 17:01.560
Hell yeah.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.560
I'm down for that.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.560
That's great.

17:03.560 --> 17:04.560
Uh, let's see.

17:04.560 --> 17:08.720
For me, I want to see Hatsune Miku just because it's so over the top.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.160
Like I just, I have to see it for myself.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.760
I have to see what those concerts are like for myself.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.400
So that's one that I really want to see.

17:15.400 --> 17:19.720
But like my fantasy thing would be, I would love, and I know many of you out there would

17:19.720 --> 17:21.200
agree with me, at least I hope you would.

17:21.200 --> 17:27.040
I would love to see like a Tetsuya Mizuguchi concert that's like res live.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.040
That would be awesome.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.720
I want to see Yuzo Koshiro and like do live stuff.

17:30.720 --> 17:31.720
Oh yeah.

17:31.720 --> 17:32.720
Yuzo Koshiro.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.720
That would be cool too.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.520
That would be another, that would be a good driving thing as well.

17:35.520 --> 17:39.960
Is Jack still doing any of those live venues anymore?

17:39.960 --> 17:41.760
I think he's on my Facebook.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.280
I thought Tako had a kid.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.280
I think so.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.280
I don't know.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.280
He's on Facebook.

17:46.280 --> 17:50.780
I wouldn't mind actually seeing Akira Yamaka do some of his live events.

17:50.780 --> 17:55.280
You know, funny enough over in our live chat over at live.vognetwork.com, MXC says I want

17:55.280 --> 17:56.720
to go to a Silent Hill concert.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.280
There you go.

17:58.280 --> 18:02.600
Brad from Paw Culture says the music from Bioshock.

18:02.600 --> 18:07.600
As shown under Matt says DDR the orchestra symphonic experience.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.400
I love it.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.640
Act F agrees that Tetsuya Mizuguchi would be awesome.

18:12.640 --> 18:16.720
Also Nobuyoshi Sano would be another dream concert there.

18:16.720 --> 18:21.240
Oh man, with Mizuguchi though, can you imagine they can do res, which would be amazing, luminous,

18:21.240 --> 18:24.880
which I would love, and Space Channel 5.

18:24.880 --> 18:25.880
Yeah.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.840
I mean, that's the concert I really want to see.

18:28.840 --> 18:29.840
I'm surprised.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.160
A live Space Channel 5 demonstration, you know.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.160
Heck yeah.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.720
The whole audience has to go choo, choo.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.840
That would be awesome.

18:37.840 --> 18:38.840
All right.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.360
Anyway, Fifth Dream closed it up here saying-

18:41.360 --> 18:43.560
Holographic Space Michael with that.

18:43.560 --> 18:45.960
I want to see one of those Persona concerts.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.720
Oh yeah, a hologram concert.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.920
Would you go to a Michael Jackson hologram concert?

18:50.920 --> 18:51.920
Probably.

18:51.920 --> 18:55.320
I was still disappointed they never did that Gorillaz one.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.640
Because they were going to do a whole Gorillaz tour that way, but they found a big problem

18:59.640 --> 19:06.000
during the Grammy Awards when Madonna came out to do her segment and the bass was so

19:06.000 --> 19:08.400
loud that it made the hologram shake.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.400
Oh wow.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.400
Yeah.

19:10.400 --> 19:17.840
So they couldn't manage the decibel level to keep because, you know, light is all a

19:17.840 --> 19:18.840
wavelength.

19:18.840 --> 19:19.840
Sure.

19:19.840 --> 19:20.840
And so is sound.

19:20.840 --> 19:21.840
Sure.

19:21.840 --> 19:22.840
So one can interfere with the other.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.400
All that Hatsune Miku stuff though is all holograms.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.400
It is.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.400
That's the only thing I can think of.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.240
So maybe the technology is better.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.240
Well, yeah.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.920
Or maybe just with Hatsune Miku it's not as-

19:32.920 --> 19:35.560
She doesn't drop the bass like everybody else does.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.600
She's super cartoony too, so maybe it's okay to-

19:38.600 --> 19:39.600
It's Gorillaz.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.600
Yeah, that's true.

19:40.600 --> 19:41.600
Gorillaz is pretty cartoony too.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.600
I don't know.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.600
Anyway.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.400
Yeah, Tiger Claw says they could have just turned down the bass.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.400
Why not?

19:46.400 --> 19:47.400
Anyway.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.400
All right.

19:48.400 --> 19:52.360
Thank you for indulging my kickoff topic thought here on concerts.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.520
Let's move on to our gaming weeks before we get into the week's gaming news.

19:56.520 --> 19:59.400
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

19:59.400 --> 20:00.400
Dark Soccer.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.400
How was your gaming week?

20:01.400 --> 20:02.400
It was okay.

20:02.400 --> 20:06.800
I've just been really slow, really busy, so I played a lot of pinball.

20:06.800 --> 20:11.460
Dan has The Getaway Working, which is the sequel to High Speed.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.460
Another Steve Ritchie table.

20:12.460 --> 20:19.040
I've played a bit of that and a bit of Black Knight 2000 and Medieval Madness.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.540
And that's really about it.

20:22.540 --> 20:26.520
That and my phone games, which I'm not going to bother with.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.640
Lots of Animal Crossing.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.000
So I just want to say, because I've gotten...

20:31.000 --> 20:35.280
So remember how before the show you guys were like, why does chat seem so empty tonight?

20:35.280 --> 20:36.720
So here's what's going on.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.040
It looks like our chat applet isn't working.

20:39.040 --> 20:42.440
I've had two people send me private messages that the chat applet isn't working.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.380
So hi, if you guys are listening.

20:44.380 --> 20:47.240
So that is the live.vog network, it isn't working.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.720
So there is another way you can get into the chat room.

20:49.720 --> 20:54.160
You have to be somewhat familiar with IRC, unfortunately, but you can go to...

20:54.160 --> 21:00.680
If you have an IRC client, you just go anywhere on the Gamesurge network, which is IRC.Gamesurge.net,

21:00.680 --> 21:04.240
and then we are in channel or hashtag vog.

21:04.240 --> 21:07.080
And that's another way you can find us, an IRC client.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.080
Obviously that's a little more complicated and old school.

21:09.080 --> 21:13.960
That's why we like to have the chat applet, but Bobby would be my guy to fix those sorts

21:13.960 --> 21:17.400
of issues, if it even is something he can fix, I don't know.

21:17.400 --> 21:21.000
And unfortunately he is at the concert right now, and so we're just gonna have to dance

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
around that.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.160
So I apologize if you guys aren't able to be here live in our chat room.

21:25.160 --> 21:29.040
But you can get in the old school way through IRC would be one way to do it.

21:29.040 --> 21:34.640
They might actually have an applet at Gamesurge.net that might work.

21:34.640 --> 21:38.640
And then again, you just have to join channel vog, because there's a lot of other gaming

21:38.640 --> 21:42.400
related channels on the network, but vog is the one that you'd find us in.

21:42.600 --> 21:47.160
So good luck to those listening, and I'm sorry the chat applet is down, but it's a little

21:47.160 --> 21:51.880
bit above my pay grade right now on where that issue is lying.

21:51.880 --> 21:56.120
Alright, if there's nothing else for Dark Soccer's gaming week, then we will head on

21:56.120 --> 21:57.120
over to Wokey.

21:57.120 --> 22:02.320
I didn't play much this week, but I did usual Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.960
I played actually some Pokemon Go, a little bit more than usual because I was at more

22:05.960 --> 22:11.420
parks, and so I was just doing that, and then I ran into the whole event that they had going

22:11.420 --> 22:12.420
on.

22:12.420 --> 22:15.440
Well, they have an event going on right now for all the Gen 1 stuff, so that's nice.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.500
Double candy and everything.

22:17.500 --> 22:22.540
And then they have the sheep one for a few hours, which I didn't have that many spawn.

22:22.540 --> 22:25.260
I mean, and I was at a park where there was a ton of shit spawning.

22:25.260 --> 22:29.180
It's just two sheep.

22:29.180 --> 22:32.500
And then, just a few self-holding games.

22:32.500 --> 22:33.500
That's pretty much it.

22:33.500 --> 22:39.540
I didn't play any Far Cry, because my wife's been taking the TV with every show.

22:39.540 --> 22:41.580
I'm watching like eight shows at once.

22:41.580 --> 22:42.580
Great.

22:42.580 --> 22:43.580
Good times.

22:43.580 --> 22:45.900
Alright, if there's nothing else for you, then my gaming week.

22:45.900 --> 22:49.820
I also had a Pokemon Go-filled week, especially today, Community Day.

22:49.820 --> 22:53.660
See, we went down to the Capitol, which seemed to be the meeting point.

22:53.660 --> 22:55.460
So there's two big parks downtown.

22:55.460 --> 22:58.540
There's Capitol Park, which is obviously where the Capitol is, and then there's another one,

22:58.540 --> 23:01.860
I think it's Southside is the name of it, South Ridge, Southside Park.

23:01.860 --> 23:04.820
Well, Southside Park had a grilled cheese festival.

23:04.820 --> 23:07.660
Yes, they brought in all these food trucks to do grilled cheese, and that was the thing.

23:07.660 --> 23:09.500
But you had to pay money to get into it.

23:09.540 --> 23:13.580
So because of that, all the people that we usually go to Southside were also at the Capitol.

23:13.580 --> 23:15.300
So the Capitol was kind of lit today.

23:15.300 --> 23:18.840
There was a lot of people there, like a lot of people walking around there.

23:18.840 --> 23:19.840
And it was fun.

23:19.840 --> 23:24.100
And I almost felt bad, though, because you know how they have the Vietnam Memorial there?

23:24.100 --> 23:28.580
They were doing some sort of memorial or tribute.

23:28.580 --> 23:31.980
I know it had to be something about memorial because they were playing Amazing Grace.

23:31.980 --> 23:35.020
And I almost kind of felt bad because there's like all these like people were being respectful

23:35.020 --> 23:38.820
kind of playing around it, you know, so that there's like people aren't going through this

23:38.820 --> 23:39.820
event here.

23:39.820 --> 23:43.220
But I was just like, oh, man, you know, with all these like people everywhere, that's that's

23:43.220 --> 23:44.220
kind of a bummer.

23:44.220 --> 23:46.680
But you know, what can you do?

23:46.680 --> 23:47.680
But be respectful.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.020
That's all you can do.

23:49.020 --> 23:53.500
So anyway, but we played at Capitol Park, everything was lured, Pokemon were spawning

23:53.500 --> 23:55.520
nonstop, I caught five shiny Mareeps.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.520
So I was pretty impressed.

23:56.520 --> 24:00.240
I didn't think I was gonna get that many because after the first hour, I only had one.

24:00.240 --> 24:03.140
And I was like, all right, well, I'm gonna be happy if I just get out of here with three,

24:03.140 --> 24:06.340
like, I'll be super happy, because I can have one of each evolution.

24:06.340 --> 24:07.340
But I ended up with five.

24:07.340 --> 24:08.920
So I was pretty thrilled with that.

24:08.920 --> 24:12.340
So that was that was Community Day.

24:12.340 --> 24:14.520
I'm liking these Community Day events a lot.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.540
It certainly is working a lot better than Go Fest in Chicago did.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.680
I think it's, you know, getting the people out.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.200
And people say it's like when the game first came out.

24:22.200 --> 24:26.940
But I would say today at Capitol Park was even more people than that.

24:26.940 --> 24:31.700
And yeah, just, you know, it's cool to have the incentives for a short time to do a little

24:31.700 --> 24:34.940
more walking was good way to get some exercise, hang out with people.

24:34.940 --> 24:38.660
So you know, kudos to Niantic on the Pokemon Go Community Days.

24:38.660 --> 24:39.980
I had a lot of fun with it.

24:39.980 --> 24:43.340
And I look forward to seeing what they do next month because I was expecting since they

24:43.340 --> 24:48.020
did Bulbasaur, I thought we would get Charmander, Squirtle would have been the next two months.

24:48.020 --> 24:51.220
But then we get Mareep today in the middle of the Kanto events.

24:51.220 --> 24:52.380
I don't know what they were thinking.

24:52.380 --> 24:53.380
That's weird.

24:53.380 --> 24:54.380
But I mean, don't be wrong.

24:54.380 --> 24:56.000
The little pink sheep is adorable.

24:56.000 --> 25:02.940
So isn't it like, I can't remember the phrase like some comes in like a lamb goes out like

25:02.940 --> 25:04.020
a lion or something like that.

25:04.020 --> 25:06.460
Is that May or April that they used to say that?

25:06.460 --> 25:07.620
I don't know.

25:07.620 --> 25:09.660
I know what expression you're talking about, but I don't.

25:09.660 --> 25:10.660
Yeah.

25:10.660 --> 25:14.860
I thought that maybe in the wine that all got replaced now with it's gonna be May.

25:14.860 --> 25:19.620
That's that's the new thing people say around the end of April.

25:19.620 --> 25:22.060
Let's see what other games I've been playing this week.

25:22.060 --> 25:25.380
A little less Nino Cooney to sadly, I don't think I've really touched a lot of that this

25:25.380 --> 25:26.380
week.

25:26.380 --> 25:27.380
That's nothing bad.

25:27.380 --> 25:28.380
It's just I've actually kind of had a busy week personally.

25:28.380 --> 25:30.220
So I haven't had a lot of time for games.

25:30.220 --> 25:35.060
But when I am gaming, I'm playing more DJ Max Respect, which I know my music gaming

25:35.060 --> 25:37.580
fans are going to be happier to hear that out there.

25:37.580 --> 25:38.580
I'm still playing that.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.700
I've been playing more six button, eight button songs.

25:40.700 --> 25:42.300
I did a stream of it the other night.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.660
I am loving the DLC.

25:44.660 --> 25:47.420
Like the DLC is what is making that game great.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.620
Like the Classic Y DLC is on point.

25:49.620 --> 25:53.340
If you have DJ Max Respect, you must buy the Classic Y DLC.

25:53.340 --> 25:55.500
It is awesome.

25:55.500 --> 25:56.780
All the Classic Y songs are great.

25:56.780 --> 25:57.780
And it's not just them.

25:57.780 --> 25:59.240
It's other stuff that's mixed in too.

25:59.240 --> 26:02.920
So I think it's like 20 bucks, but it's really, really good.

26:02.920 --> 26:07.080
I think the reason why DJ Max Respect maybe isn't like flying off the digital shelf is

26:07.080 --> 26:09.440
it is still a $50 game.

26:09.440 --> 26:13.280
So I think once that game kind of comes down a little bit in price and if they can kind

26:13.280 --> 26:17.120
of get it some more visibility on the store or something, I think 20 bucks for the base

26:17.120 --> 26:20.080
game and 20 bucks for Classic Y is going to be really hard to argue with.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.640
That's going to be a great combo.

26:22.640 --> 26:26.600
If you like music games, if you don't like music games, then you probably are not going

26:26.600 --> 26:27.600
to like DJ Max Respect.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.040
I don't think there's a whole lot there for you.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.440
Otherwise, I can't think of a lot.

26:32.440 --> 26:37.520
I think I was playing random stuff on Xbox 360 with, or Xbox One, excuse me, with the

26:37.520 --> 26:40.000
360 backwards compatibility.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.840
And I think I went in there and played Path of Exile for a little bit because that's on

26:42.840 --> 26:46.280
Xbox One as a free download and it's on my system.

26:46.280 --> 26:50.320
So I played a little bit of that, but nothing, I just spent a ton of time really with any

26:50.320 --> 26:56.640
other console or, oh, no, there was one other PC game I'd played a lot of, Overwatch.

26:56.680 --> 27:02.080
And yes, I know I play quite a bit of Overwatch all the time anyway, but they did the whole

27:02.080 --> 27:05.720
Retribution, I think is the name of it, the event.

27:05.720 --> 27:11.200
They started a new event in Overwatch and it's basically the PvE event where you still

27:11.200 --> 27:15.000
team up with three other people, but it's a little more like Mass Effect multiplayer

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
was, which I loved where you're doing the waves of enemies that are coming at you.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.280
But it's not like, it's not like Mass Effect was all kind of on a stationary map where

27:23.280 --> 27:28.040
in this, you kind of move from place to place, you're kind of clearing out the enemies in

27:28.040 --> 27:29.040
each place.

27:29.040 --> 27:32.040
And then there's some like that are harder, like boss enemies and stuff.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.040
So it's great.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.560
Like it's a really fun PvE event.

27:34.560 --> 27:38.040
And I really wish this was a permanent mode in the game.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.000
I kind of think it will be eventually.

27:40.000 --> 27:46.680
I think PvE will be how Overwatch does an expansion later on, because I don't see where

27:46.680 --> 27:49.520
like this game is going to sustain for years and years and years.

27:49.520 --> 27:55.280
I mean, let me rephrase, because obviously there's tons of people that still play online.

27:55.280 --> 27:59.840
You have Overwatch League and all this other stuff, but like, you know, how is Overwatch

27:59.840 --> 28:04.760
going to keep getting people to drop money on it years and years after release?

28:04.760 --> 28:09.840
I mean, sure, they can release new skins and new loot boxes and all that, but I mean, Blizzard,

28:09.840 --> 28:13.200
what works for them in other places, what they've done for Diablo, what they've done

28:13.200 --> 28:16.760
for World of Warcraft, what they've done for all these other games, they do expansions.

28:16.800 --> 28:22.120
So I think Overwatch would be great to do like a PvE expansion would work really well

28:22.120 --> 28:27.560
for them that takes these modes like Retribution and the Uprising they did last year and kind

28:27.560 --> 28:29.440
of expand on it.

28:29.440 --> 28:33.240
That way they could do something that isn't like new heroes, right?

28:33.240 --> 28:37.360
Because that would be the tempting thing is that you put new heroes in an expansion, but

28:37.360 --> 28:40.600
people would probably be kind of irritated about that because they'd be like, well, wait,

28:40.600 --> 28:43.880
all the heroes are supposed to be for free, but they could put like this PvE and it would

28:43.880 --> 28:46.760
be like a completely separate experience for Overwatch in an expansion.

28:46.760 --> 28:50.440
And I think that would make a lot of sense for where Blizzard could go next.

28:50.440 --> 28:53.520
But I mean, we'll see, I guess.

28:53.520 --> 28:57.800
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, some folks agree with me on my positive feeling

28:57.800 --> 28:59.400
for Overwatch Retribution.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.840
Vidpower says Overwatch Retribution is legit.

29:02.840 --> 29:05.160
Actf says Overwatch Retribution is pretty awesome.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.560
It felt like Left 4 Dead for me.

29:08.560 --> 29:12.800
And Actf says the bosses in Retribution are kind of like Left 4 Dead bosses.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.520
So good comparison there.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.520
Yeah, Left 4 Dead.

29:16.520 --> 29:17.520
I always forget about that.

29:17.520 --> 29:18.520
You know why?

29:18.520 --> 29:21.040
Because there hasn't been a new one in years.

29:21.040 --> 29:28.200
So anyway, if you have Overwatch, even though I'm talking about expansion PvE, this Retribution

29:28.200 --> 29:29.340
thing is a free event.

29:29.340 --> 29:32.680
So go check it out and yeah.

29:32.680 --> 29:38.400
And hopefully at some point the game, I will get good favor and I will get my Kris Jenner

29:38.400 --> 29:42.700
Sombra outfit because there's a new outfit for Sombra that makes her look like Kris Jenner

29:42.700 --> 29:43.900
and I want it.

29:43.900 --> 29:46.860
So yes, I do not have it yet.

29:46.860 --> 29:48.580
I haven't gotten a single.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.180
I've probably gained like four levels.

29:51.180 --> 29:52.540
Got all my loot boxes for the week.

29:52.540 --> 29:59.580
I haven't gotten a single skin that's unique to the Retribution event and I'm a little

29:59.580 --> 30:00.580
huffy about it.

30:00.580 --> 30:02.140
So hopefully next week my luck will turn around.

30:02.140 --> 30:03.140
We'll see.

30:03.140 --> 30:05.140
All right.

30:05.140 --> 30:08.180
Actf in chat says I need the Moira Blackwatch costume.

30:08.180 --> 30:11.060
I have been having a lot more fun playing Moira.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.060
She is a lot of fun.

30:12.420 --> 30:16.380
Now that I'm learning how to use her better, where I use her little dart thing where she

30:16.380 --> 30:21.260
goes invisible for a minute to get behind enemies or get behind the other team and maybe

30:21.260 --> 30:26.280
in a room or something to get behind them and zap them, it's so much fun.

30:26.280 --> 30:29.780
But I've been doing a lot of streaming with my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realist and

30:29.780 --> 30:31.100
he always picks Moira.

30:31.100 --> 30:34.740
But that's fine because at least you know the team has a healer and I get to play something

30:34.740 --> 30:37.180
like Junkrat or Pharah, which I also enjoy playing a lot.

30:37.180 --> 30:39.620
So there you go.

30:39.620 --> 30:40.620
All right.

30:40.620 --> 30:41.620
Let's see.

30:42.180 --> 30:45.380
I don't know of any shows off we have coming up until June.

30:45.380 --> 30:48.080
I know you're not going to be here for a week or two, Jamie.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.900
You're going to be going to Drag Con, not Dragun Con, but Drag Con.

30:51.900 --> 30:52.900
Yes.

30:52.900 --> 30:54.700
I'll be getting a different kind of geek on.

30:54.700 --> 30:55.700
That'll be fun.

30:55.700 --> 30:56.700
You're gonna have a lot of fun with that.

30:56.700 --> 31:00.280
I'm a little jealous I can't go, but you know, it is what it is.

31:00.280 --> 31:03.260
So you'll be gone for a couple or a week, maybe two in May.

31:03.260 --> 31:04.260
Possibly.

31:04.260 --> 31:06.420
It depends on if I can get back in time on Sunday.

31:06.420 --> 31:07.420
But we'll still be.

31:07.420 --> 31:08.420
Loki and I'll still be here.

31:08.420 --> 31:09.420
Yes.

31:09.420 --> 31:12.540
We might invite invite a friend of ours to take the third chair that night and keep on

31:12.540 --> 31:13.900
going here.

31:13.900 --> 31:16.660
We will have the week after our 16th anniversary.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.660
Oh my God.

31:18.660 --> 31:19.660
Show's old enough to drive.

31:19.660 --> 31:20.660
Our 16th anniversary.

31:20.660 --> 31:22.620
The week after that, we will be off.

31:22.620 --> 31:26.580
That's always a great way to reward ourselves with a birthday is a week off.

31:26.580 --> 31:30.140
Anyway, you can always follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O.L.R.

31:30.140 --> 31:33.540
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

31:33.540 --> 31:36.140
And again, if you're just joining us this evening and you're having problems getting

31:36.140 --> 31:39.140
in the chat room, apparently it's a pretty widespread issue.

31:39.140 --> 31:42.680
I guess even the game surge clients and folks are having problems with that.

31:42.680 --> 31:43.680
So I apologize.

31:43.680 --> 31:47.500
It looks like the only way you can really get in is with an IRC client, which I use

31:47.500 --> 31:50.100
M.I.R.C. on my PC here in the studio.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.860
I do know that some exist on the phones.

31:52.860 --> 31:56.680
You can get IRC apps for your phones, but a lot of those cost money.

31:56.680 --> 32:00.420
So and, you know, I don't think you should have to pay money unless you really, really,

32:00.420 --> 32:01.420
really want to.

32:01.420 --> 32:06.700
I should always give a shout out for our Discord as well, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

32:06.700 --> 32:11.260
I don't really read live comments from the Discord because it's just too much to monitor

32:11.260 --> 32:12.980
more than one chat room.

32:12.980 --> 32:15.140
But you can always leave us a feedback there.

32:15.140 --> 32:16.300
And we do read it throughout the week.

32:16.300 --> 32:17.300
We do interact.

32:17.300 --> 32:20.900
It's a good it's a better chance to actually get us to write in chat is by using our Discord.

32:20.900 --> 32:25.540
So if you're not already there, check that out, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

32:25.540 --> 32:31.620
And in our chat, actdeft recommends Andro IRC is free and pretty easy to use.

32:31.620 --> 32:32.860
Yeah, I think that's what I have.

32:32.860 --> 32:37.300
That must be an Android thing because I don't have it because I'm on iPhone.

32:37.300 --> 32:43.000
The one I have on iPhone is called, oh, hell, what is it called?

32:43.000 --> 32:45.300
Something lime something is what it's called.

32:45.300 --> 32:46.300
Lime chat.

32:46.300 --> 32:47.300
Yeah, lime chat.

32:47.300 --> 32:48.300
That's what I have.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.300
But I had to pay five bucks for it.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.940
So not everybody may agree with me there.

32:51.940 --> 32:52.940
So.

32:52.940 --> 32:53.940
All right.

32:53.940 --> 32:54.940
Anyway.

32:55.660 --> 32:57.100
Our listener is that I'm looking.

32:57.100 --> 33:00.200
She just sent me another picture of the game surge thing not working either.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.200
So yeah.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.200
What a mess.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.200
Sorry, guys.

33:03.200 --> 33:07.560
Hopefully it's something that if it's not working on game surges own site, that's something

33:07.560 --> 33:11.220
that they're gonna have to take a look at that will probably get fixed in the next week.

33:11.220 --> 33:14.760
So it's it's a temporary thing, I guess.

33:14.760 --> 33:15.760
All right.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.580
Let's move on to some actual gaming news.

33:18.580 --> 33:19.580
For now.

33:19.580 --> 33:20.580
Loki.

33:20.580 --> 33:24.900
Yeah, this is kind of unusual, but I guess it's something that we can expect.

33:24.900 --> 33:29.180
Since they're partnering up with Microsoft for this cross play stuff.

33:29.180 --> 33:35.740
So Microsoft is doing that Minecraft Better Together update that's going out to all the

33:35.740 --> 33:39.140
different platforms that Minecraft is on.

33:39.140 --> 33:40.340
One of those being the Switch.

33:40.340 --> 33:47.200
And with that, because, you know, it is forcing you to basically create an Xbox Live account

33:47.200 --> 33:52.220
in order to be able to communicate across platforms, you also get achievements.

33:52.220 --> 33:55.820
So you can actually earn achievements in the Switch version of the game.

33:55.820 --> 33:58.660
Well, Microsoft achievements.

33:58.660 --> 34:00.980
And then also on other platforms as well.

34:00.980 --> 34:04.220
So like mobile platforms and stuff, you can earn achievements as well.

34:04.220 --> 34:09.780
So it's pretty interesting that the first achievement system that will be on Nintendo's

34:09.780 --> 34:14.060
platform will actually be Microsoft's.

34:14.060 --> 34:15.940
That is so weird to me.

34:15.940 --> 34:19.260
But at the same time, okay, is it but it's not necessarily I mean, I know a lot of the

34:19.260 --> 34:22.740
headline grabbing stuff is saying, oh, it's Xbox achievements.

34:22.740 --> 34:29.140
But technically, the Microsoft system is built into Windows as well, right?

34:29.140 --> 34:30.140
Right.

34:30.140 --> 34:35.220
Yeah, you can actually download like Microsoft Solitaire and micro like a lot of the stuff

34:35.220 --> 34:39.420
in Microsoft Store, which I know not everybody uses all the time.

34:39.420 --> 34:42.620
But if you actually go to Microsoft Store, you can actually see some of their free games

34:42.620 --> 34:43.620
in there.

34:43.620 --> 34:45.860
And some of them have achievements like there's like a minesweeper game with achievements

34:45.860 --> 34:47.780
and all that, that you get on PC.

34:47.780 --> 34:51.660
And they also tie into what was classically your Xbox score.

34:51.660 --> 34:53.220
So it's not really an Xbox thing.

34:53.220 --> 34:54.340
It's a Microsoft thing.

34:54.340 --> 34:55.340
Yeah.

34:55.340 --> 35:00.660
So knowing that Microsoft now owns Minecraft, is this as big of a leap as some of these

35:00.660 --> 35:02.840
sensationalist headlines are making us believe?

35:02.840 --> 35:06.660
It's interesting just because it's not really a Microsoft platform per se.

35:06.660 --> 35:08.900
It's other systems.

35:08.900 --> 35:12.500
Can you imagine getting Xbox achievements on, you know, the PlayStation?

35:12.500 --> 35:13.500
Yeah.

35:14.140 --> 35:18.420
Well, some of the funny shit I'm reading is that, well, Nintendo should just let Microsoft

35:18.420 --> 35:21.180
design their achievement system, you know.

35:21.180 --> 35:26.460
Why even just let them design their achievement system and just have them do the online system?

35:26.460 --> 35:28.780
Why not just let Nintendo connect to Xbox Live?

35:28.780 --> 35:31.980
Why not just be done with all of it and just while we're at it, hey, why don't we just

35:31.980 --> 35:36.300
let Nintendo games play on the Xbox, you know, one?

35:36.300 --> 35:38.020
Form an alliance to take out something.

35:38.020 --> 35:39.020
Let's just do that.

35:39.020 --> 35:40.780
It'll give everybody what they want.

35:40.980 --> 35:48.740
We'll have a solid online network for the Switch and people will get, you know, Nintendo

35:48.740 --> 35:53.060
being a third-party developer for other systems.

35:53.060 --> 35:54.060
It's win-win.

35:54.060 --> 36:01.380
Looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Rama in chat says, yes, Minecraft is cross-platform.

36:01.380 --> 36:05.020
Just remember that they're the ones hosting the servers for the game, which explains the

36:05.020 --> 36:06.500
need for a Microsoft account.

36:06.500 --> 36:11.860
Oh, yes, that's come up before with the whole cross-platform and why Sony was like, oh,

36:11.860 --> 36:16.340
hell to the nah as to why they were not going to go cross-platform because they did not

36:16.340 --> 36:19.540
want people to have to have a Microsoft account to play it because it's a little silly.

36:19.540 --> 36:22.940
Well, I kind of get it.

36:22.940 --> 36:24.100
I kind of get it.

36:24.100 --> 36:25.100
You know what I mean?

36:25.100 --> 36:28.780
Like, you know, Sony's not going to bend over and give Microsoft that one.

36:28.780 --> 36:29.780
You know what I mean?

36:29.780 --> 36:31.300
Oh, you're not going to play nice with our system.

36:31.300 --> 36:34.740
Well, we're just not going to let you play with your friends.

36:34.740 --> 36:36.780
You can just go buy another system and do that.

36:36.780 --> 36:42.060
I'm honestly surprised that Microsoft continues to release Minecraft for the PlayStation,

36:42.060 --> 36:43.420
to be quite honest.

36:43.420 --> 36:48.700
I would think that Microsoft would have made that essentially a Microsoft exclusive, an

36:48.700 --> 36:50.940
Xbox exclusive, a PC exclusive.

36:50.940 --> 36:54.740
Although I can see again maybe where it does benefit them, especially with the Switch being

36:54.740 --> 36:58.380
portable and everything, to continue to do it for the Switch.

36:58.380 --> 37:01.660
But I'm really surprised that Microsoft just didn't say, you know, we're just going to

37:01.660 --> 37:02.660
drop the PlayStation.

37:02.660 --> 37:04.620
Minecraft 2 comes out eventually.

37:04.620 --> 37:06.700
Oh, it'll be on it.

37:06.700 --> 37:08.860
They're fucking assholes about it.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.460
Maybe we don't need to release it on the same platform.

37:10.460 --> 37:13.620
Do you think Minecraft 2 will have, I've been, I'm kind of sick of predicting it.

37:13.620 --> 37:18.260
I feel like every, I've said to every E3 for the past two or three years, I said, Microsoft

37:18.260 --> 37:19.900
bought Minecraft.

37:19.900 --> 37:22.300
They're going to put out Minecraft 2.

37:22.300 --> 37:24.700
It has to happen someday.

37:24.700 --> 37:25.700
And yeah, I agree.

37:25.700 --> 37:28.780
When Minecraft 2 comes out, it'll be out on Xbox and PC first.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.620
I don't think they're actually going to release Minecraft 2.

37:30.660 --> 37:34.980
They have their whole storefront is where they're making their money, I think, allegedly.

37:34.980 --> 37:35.980
Allegedly.

37:35.980 --> 37:36.980
All right.

37:36.980 --> 37:37.980
I don't know.

37:37.980 --> 37:43.460
I would, I mean, yeah, maybe you have to be like some really, you know, breathtakingly

37:43.460 --> 37:45.100
advanced thing.

37:45.100 --> 37:49.580
Rama in chat says Minecraft isn't exclusive because Microsoft owns the company itself

37:49.580 --> 37:52.180
for releasing the game, not the game.

37:52.180 --> 37:53.180
That's the difference.

37:53.180 --> 37:54.180
Well, yes and no.

37:54.180 --> 38:00.580
I mean, Microsoft would still, would be well within their rights still to tell said company,

38:00.580 --> 38:04.860
well, because we ultimately own you, you're not putting this out on Sony's platform.

38:04.860 --> 38:08.660
Now I'm sure they're, and to be fair, the reason why they are still releasing it for

38:08.660 --> 38:12.860
PlayStation is that people are buying it on PlayStation and they're making money at the

38:12.860 --> 38:13.860
end of the day.

38:13.860 --> 38:14.860
So that's fine.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.300
They don't need to necessarily ban it from the system, what they could do.

38:17.300 --> 38:18.300
Timed exclusive.

38:18.300 --> 38:19.900
You get it a year later.

38:19.900 --> 38:20.900
That's true.

38:21.020 --> 38:25.780
You know, this isn't, the Minecraft is also not the first example of a Microsoft related

38:25.780 --> 38:31.700
studio doing this because Viva Pinata was on the DS of it, like not the exact same Viva

38:31.700 --> 38:32.700
Pinata game, but you know what I mean?

38:32.700 --> 38:35.040
There was like a spinoff game that was on the DS.

38:35.040 --> 38:36.540
And I think it's that same type of logic.

38:36.540 --> 38:38.600
It wasn't coming from Microsoft.

38:38.600 --> 38:42.380
It was coming from, you know, one of their own studios, but

38:42.380 --> 38:43.800
Ah yes, Viva Pinata.

38:43.800 --> 38:44.800
That was going to be a thing.

38:44.800 --> 38:45.800
Yeah.

38:45.800 --> 38:51.440
Well, I mean, they did, they did get a TV show and they, they, they, they almost had

38:51.440 --> 38:52.440
it.

38:52.440 --> 38:53.440
Yeah.

38:53.440 --> 38:54.440
There was a Viva Pinata cartoon.

38:54.440 --> 38:55.440
Don't you remember?

38:55.440 --> 38:56.440
No.

38:56.440 --> 38:57.440
Where were you?

38:57.440 --> 38:58.440
It wasn't, it wasn't very long, but there was one.

38:58.440 --> 39:02.200
Vidpower says Viva Pinata games were so good.

39:02.200 --> 39:05.220
So some people, they were, they were fans with that.

39:05.220 --> 39:11.480
So SSG100Matt in chat says, it's like Disney going to take away all their Disney movies

39:11.480 --> 39:15.720
along with their properties from Netflix when they come out with their own service.

39:15.720 --> 39:16.800
Oh yeah.

39:16.800 --> 39:20.920
And that's why I kind of think Disney sucks for doing that.

39:20.920 --> 39:27.180
But at the same time, like Netflix and Hulu and those companies, they are stepping it

39:27.180 --> 39:30.360
up when it comes to creating originals.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.360
You know what I mean?

39:31.360 --> 39:34.400
Like, there are so many originals on both those that are coming out.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.400
And Oh, darn.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.840
Oh, I can't watch my digital versions of Disney movies.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.640
Oh wait, there's piracy on the internet.

39:41.640 --> 39:42.960
That's right.

39:42.960 --> 39:45.480
I guess I'll just pirate that.

39:45.480 --> 39:50.720
I actually think the Disney service stands to do very well because kids, people are going

39:50.720 --> 39:54.400
to be like, wait a minute, I can just pay $10 a month and have a babysitter with like

39:54.400 --> 39:56.600
an infinite supply of movies.

39:56.600 --> 39:57.600
Yes, please.

39:57.600 --> 39:58.600
That's what they're going to do.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.760
Or you can just pay $0 a month and put them on YouTube.

40:00.760 --> 40:01.760
Kids app.

40:01.760 --> 40:02.760
Okay.

40:02.760 --> 40:03.760
Here's the reality though.

40:03.760 --> 40:07.720
If that Disney thing, and tell me if y'all agree in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

40:07.760 --> 40:08.760
If you can get in.

40:08.760 --> 40:09.760
Sorry.

40:09.760 --> 40:13.800
So it's, it's hardwired in my brain to keep saying live.vognetwork.com and I realized

40:13.800 --> 40:14.800
the chat room is down.

40:14.800 --> 40:15.800
I'm sorry.

40:15.800 --> 40:21.800
Um, but, uh, here's the thing that would get me to, uh, instantly purchase that Disney

40:21.800 --> 40:27.360
thing if they have a Tron related anything, if they bring back Tron uprising or whatever

40:27.360 --> 40:29.600
the anime was, I would, I'd do it.

40:29.600 --> 40:30.600
You're shaking your head.

40:30.600 --> 40:31.600
You wouldn't do it.

40:31.600 --> 40:32.600
They wouldn't do it.

40:32.600 --> 40:33.600
It wouldn't do it.

40:33.600 --> 40:34.600
You gotta do something Tron.

40:34.600 --> 40:37.480
We had some stories on shaking and crying about some interesting reboots.

40:38.240 --> 40:39.240
They were talking about doing on Disney.

40:39.240 --> 40:40.240
Yeah.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.240
Like Tron.

40:41.240 --> 40:42.240
Oh, Tron.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.240
Wasn't one of them.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.240
I don't think.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.240
You're supposed to be rebooting that.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.240
Really?

40:46.240 --> 40:47.240
Well, I'm speaking of reboots.

40:47.240 --> 40:49.680
They rebooted reboot and it's fucking terrible.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.840
It's like, what the hell is this shit?

40:51.840 --> 40:54.280
Like I saw reboot, I'm like, Ooh, reboot.

40:54.280 --> 40:57.800
And I'm like, well, wait, what's all this live action bullshit.

40:57.800 --> 41:05.000
Uh, anyway, um, yeah, I just on the whole like Hulu and Netflix and all this and how

41:05.080 --> 41:06.080
they're competing thing.

41:06.080 --> 41:11.280
Like, um, I know y'all know, I watch a lot of RuPaul's drag race and I have a podcast

41:11.280 --> 41:14.240
that I host with some friends about it called reading is fundamental.

41:14.240 --> 41:20.760
Um, but in following drag race and stuff, they used to tape their show.

41:20.760 --> 41:24.640
Drag race was done at the Hollywood center studios for years and years, which is right

41:24.640 --> 41:29.120
in the heart of Hollywood, like right off of Hollywood Boulevard, which is not the most

41:29.120 --> 41:32.400
glamorous part of town, but there were some studios there.

41:32.400 --> 41:37.680
They have not been able to film there for the past couple of years because, and as Ru

41:37.680 --> 41:44.640
said on, on his podcast, uh, Netflix and Hulu have rented all that space for like a year

41:44.640 --> 41:45.640
out.

41:45.640 --> 41:47.320
So they've had to tape the most recent season.

41:47.320 --> 41:51.080
That's why a drag race season 10 looks different because they taped it at a whole different

41:51.080 --> 41:52.080
studio.

41:52.080 --> 41:54.800
They're out in the Valley now or something.

41:54.800 --> 42:00.040
I can see that because they have like, was it the Joel McHale show and oh my God.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.200
Now they just like lost in space.

42:02.200 --> 42:03.200
Just came out this year.

42:03.200 --> 42:07.400
I watched, it was, it was all right.

42:07.400 --> 42:15.440
It was like, eh, this is a, I mean this is sort of lost in space, but it's like, okay.

42:15.440 --> 42:18.600
Brad from pop culture and chat just marathon the lost in space reboot.

42:18.600 --> 42:19.840
That's what he says there.

42:19.840 --> 42:20.840
I watched the first episode.

42:20.840 --> 42:21.840
It was all right.

42:21.840 --> 42:25.080
I mean, it's just like, I was, I don't know.

42:25.080 --> 42:26.680
I like, it might get better.

42:26.680 --> 42:28.240
Yeah, I'll, I'll check it out.

42:28.240 --> 42:29.240
I never was a huge fan.

42:29.240 --> 42:30.240
Like I liked the movie.

42:30.240 --> 42:34.200
I liked the remade movie that they did, which was pretty much terrible, but I liked it anyways.

42:34.200 --> 42:39.160
Um, and I was like, okay, I'll give this a chance, but it was all right.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.760
And I mean, I don't know.

42:40.760 --> 42:43.120
It was a little, it's funny though.

42:43.120 --> 42:48.200
It's like, like, don't get me wrong then the show is like, it's pretty, there's a lot of

42:48.200 --> 42:49.200
drama in the show.

42:49.200 --> 42:52.800
Like, I mean, it's pretty intense, I think for kids and stuff, but they have it in the

42:52.800 --> 42:54.400
Netflix kids section.

42:54.400 --> 42:59.000
I'm like, uh, I can't see my kids watching that in this.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.040
They just have a thicker skin this day and age.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.680
It's like, oh fuck, no they don't.

43:02.680 --> 43:06.600
There's probably kids watching Stranger Things and like, there's a few scenes in Stranger

43:06.600 --> 43:09.160
Things that are like, I don't know if I'd want a kid to see that.

43:09.160 --> 43:11.740
But they did have the remade Speed Racer on there.

43:11.740 --> 43:15.800
The Speed Racer movie, the Wachowski one that everyone hates that I think is fantastic.

43:15.800 --> 43:18.000
But um, I'm like trying to get my kids to watch that.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.320
That movie has its fans though.

43:19.320 --> 43:24.560
But they, they, they, they only want to watch random episodes of different Power Rangers

43:24.560 --> 43:25.560
stuff now.

43:25.560 --> 43:27.080
My son is just like super in the Power Rangers.

43:27.080 --> 43:28.080
Oh my God.

43:28.080 --> 43:31.240
Why haven't you just hired Shane as a babysitter?

43:31.240 --> 43:32.600
They could all do that together.

43:32.600 --> 43:33.600
It's just like that.

43:33.600 --> 43:36.120
He just, he loves Power Rangers.

43:36.120 --> 43:37.120
He keeps asking.

43:37.120 --> 43:38.120
Are you sure?

43:38.120 --> 43:39.120
Are you sure?

43:39.120 --> 43:40.120
Sure.

43:40.120 --> 43:41.120
He's your kid.

43:41.120 --> 43:42.120
Yes.

43:42.120 --> 43:46.460
Cause I, I, well the second one, no, technically I did not see the second one removed from

43:46.460 --> 43:47.460
my wife.

43:47.460 --> 43:50.600
She had to go on surgery and it was an emergency surgery so they could have swapped it with

43:50.600 --> 43:51.840
somebody else.

43:51.840 --> 43:53.640
The first one I know is mine.

43:53.640 --> 43:54.640
Okay.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.360
Or at least I know it was my wife's.

43:56.360 --> 43:57.360
Oh my God.

43:57.360 --> 43:58.360
I'm dying.

43:58.360 --> 43:59.360
All right.

43:59.360 --> 44:00.360
Anyway.

44:00.360 --> 44:05.840
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

44:05.840 --> 44:08.640
use the passphrase, mom.

44:08.640 --> 44:09.640
Let's move on.

44:09.640 --> 44:10.640
Change the subject, please.

44:10.640 --> 44:11.640
All right.

44:11.640 --> 44:17.200
Let's talk a little bit about, uh, this actually, it doesn't just affect a Nintendo, but there's

44:17.200 --> 44:22.200
a lot of gaming blogs that are running this on how this affects Nintendo because if you've

44:22.200 --> 44:25.880
ever had a Nintendo warranty, which, you know, if you buy a Nintendo product, there

44:25.880 --> 44:27.080
is a warranty.

44:27.080 --> 44:31.980
You probably haven't read a lot of it, but anyway, the warranty does state this warranty

44:31.980 --> 44:37.440
shall not apply if this product is used with products not sold or licensed by Nintendo.

44:37.440 --> 44:43.460
So you may not have known that, but like remember when the third party doc was bricking consoles?

44:43.460 --> 44:47.560
Technically Nintendo can wash their hands of that because you voided your warranty because

44:47.560 --> 44:49.920
you used it with products not sold or licensed by Nintendo.

44:49.920 --> 44:53.680
But then I'm thinking, God, how many third party stuff is like right there on the shelf?

44:53.680 --> 44:54.680
Like it's pretty crazy.

44:54.680 --> 44:55.680
Anyway.

44:55.680 --> 44:56.680
Well guess what?

44:56.680 --> 45:03.600
Because the FTC this week put out a statement that says policies like this are illegal.

45:03.600 --> 45:04.600
That's right.

45:04.600 --> 45:09.820
According to the FTC quote, unless warrenters provide the parts or services for free or

45:09.820 --> 45:16.440
receive a waiver from the FTC, such statements generally are prohibited by the Magnuson Moss

45:16.440 --> 45:20.940
warranty act, a law that governs consumer product warranties.

45:20.940 --> 45:24.820
So the FTC actually sent Nintendo a letter warning them of this.

45:24.820 --> 45:27.480
And so Nintendo is going to have to change their wording.

45:27.480 --> 45:30.240
So I had heard of this affecting other stuff in the industry as well.

45:30.240 --> 45:34.420
So it's very, I heard that this also applied to like, you know, televisions, well just

45:34.420 --> 45:36.380
anything that has like warranty voided.

45:36.380 --> 45:40.820
If you remove this sticker type thing, pillows, if you cut the tag illegal, if you cut the

45:40.820 --> 45:42.920
tag, well, that's illegal.

45:42.920 --> 45:47.820
If you cut the tag before you, I know, I know it's before you purchase, yeah, I know

45:47.820 --> 45:48.820
it's different.

45:48.820 --> 45:49.820
Anyway.

45:49.820 --> 45:53.220
Um, but yeah, the, uh, that's, that's a very interesting thing about warranty.

45:53.220 --> 45:56.140
So Nintendo is going to have to, I guess, kind of be nice, nice with the third party

45:56.140 --> 46:00.700
stuff now, or they've got to go get a waiver or they're going to have to hold themselves

46:00.700 --> 46:02.400
to this some other way.

46:02.400 --> 46:06.520
So that is interesting how that ruling is having a pretty big effect on gaming, especially

46:06.520 --> 46:07.520
again.

46:07.520 --> 46:11.680
I can't help but think of Nintendo in the third party docs, so, all right, moving on

46:11.680 --> 46:14.840
Dark Sakura, let's go to your next story.

46:14.840 --> 46:24.200
It is an end of an era because the king has been dethroned, deposed, and there's drama.

46:24.200 --> 46:28.000
Isn't there always drama in classic arcade gaming?

46:28.000 --> 46:33.120
Well, um, and this, I'm sure everyone knows it by now, but Billy Mitchell has been ousted

46:33.120 --> 46:39.160
from twin galaxies for cheating because the points that he submitted, um, his one of the

46:39.160 --> 46:47.960
1,047,200 point score on Donkey Kong was proven to have been done with an, uh, emulator.

46:47.960 --> 46:53.800
And they do have an emulator category, but he submitted it as having been on the original,

46:53.800 --> 46:56.160
um, hardware.

46:56.160 --> 47:03.600
And, um, as it stands, um, he is actually banned from taking part in further competitions

47:03.600 --> 47:08.880
in the future, um, and they submitted the findings to the Guinness Book of World Records

47:08.880 --> 47:11.280
to strike his record there too.

47:11.280 --> 47:17.080
Um, and he is completely banned, including his achievements in Pac-Man as well.

47:17.080 --> 47:23.860
So yeah, he has, and it's funny, there was a conversation that, uh, Dan had this morning

47:23.860 --> 47:29.440
with one of his buddies on the phone where when, um, Walter, uh, what's his name?

47:29.440 --> 47:30.440
Walter Day.

47:30.440 --> 47:36.840
Yeah, that for him, it was easy to overlook even if he knew it was going on because Billy

47:36.840 --> 47:39.920
Mitchell was a good PR guy.

47:39.920 --> 47:43.600
Billy Mitchell brought attention, more attention to twin galaxies, especially then when we

47:43.600 --> 47:47.400
had the whole King of Kong going on, even though it painted him as the villain in their

47:47.400 --> 47:48.400
little story.

47:48.400 --> 47:53.280
You know, that was an exercise in hyperbole, but, um, didn't you, didn't you meet, didn't

47:53.280 --> 47:55.960
we meet Walter Day once?

47:55.960 --> 47:57.040
I'm all positive we did.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.040
You know why?

47:58.040 --> 47:59.040
Okay.

47:59.040 --> 48:03.040
So before we were here at VOG Network, we were on another network, um, called all games.com

48:03.040 --> 48:05.680
and they're still around and kicking and I got nothing but good things to say about them.

48:05.680 --> 48:06.680
Go check them out.

48:06.680 --> 48:08.280
Cause I got a lot of great indie gaming podcasts too.

48:08.280 --> 48:14.120
Um, but all games.com, the time we were there, they had that show, All Games Interactive,

48:14.120 --> 48:18.920
which was Scott and, uh, um, um, Lawrence and all them host that show.

48:18.920 --> 48:23.760
Well, that show kind of became Drama Central for classic arcade gaming.

48:23.760 --> 48:26.280
And I'm not saying that in a negative way.

48:26.280 --> 48:28.800
Anybody that listened to it during those years would agree with me.

48:28.800 --> 48:32.840
It became Drama Central for these classic arcade gaming disputes because of the whole

48:32.840 --> 48:38.440
Mr. Awesome saga and the whole missile command stuff like this went on for like years, right

48:38.440 --> 48:39.440
on that shot.

48:39.440 --> 48:40.660
Like I swear to God, they never made it.

48:40.660 --> 48:44.220
So anyway, my point is, it's just, it's kind of funny that like all these years later,

48:44.220 --> 48:47.920
this drama is still going when I'm sitting in the back of my mind going, you know, the

48:47.920 --> 48:53.400
common denominator in all of this with all due respect is Walter Day.

48:53.400 --> 48:58.120
I'm just, but you, but you, well, and this just plays into what you're about to say,

48:58.120 --> 48:59.120
right?

48:59.120 --> 49:03.960
Well, it's just that, you know, it seems to me that he would have been willing to turn

49:03.960 --> 49:08.960
to blind eye when it's, you know, one of his PR, you know, one of the people bringing a

49:08.960 --> 49:14.900
lot of good attention to twin galaxies, but now there's new blood and who apparently isn't

49:14.900 --> 49:16.480
going to stand for any cheating.

49:16.480 --> 49:21.320
And I'm, I'm glad for that because it sullies the reputation and good standing of using

49:21.320 --> 49:24.320
twin galaxies as some sort of standard.

49:24.320 --> 49:31.240
So and on top of that, it's not like it needs, you know, Billy Mitchell's reputation behind

49:31.240 --> 49:33.200
it anymore.

49:33.200 --> 49:40.360
I don't think that he's made a comment on it himself, but honestly enough, I, it's sad,

49:40.360 --> 49:44.080
but I'm not, I don't really feel sorry for him.

49:44.080 --> 49:47.640
If you cheat, you deserve to be held accountable for it.

49:47.640 --> 49:55.200
And if this is what being held accountable is, it'll set a really good warning for other

49:55.200 --> 49:57.640
others who would cheat the same way.

49:57.640 --> 50:04.440
So I, I approve.

50:04.440 --> 50:10.600
I think what's kind of sad about the whole thing is the fact that Billy Mitchell, like,

50:10.600 --> 50:12.280
he wasn't bad at Donkey Kong.

50:12.280 --> 50:13.680
No, he was really good.

50:13.680 --> 50:16.240
You know, he has played the game live.

50:16.240 --> 50:18.920
And I realized there's this whole dispute about the tape and this is where this all

50:18.920 --> 50:19.920
comes from.

50:19.920 --> 50:23.480
But the reality is he's played the game in front of live audiences and has performed

50:23.480 --> 50:27.720
well, certainly better than I would certainly better than most people would.

50:27.720 --> 50:31.000
So I mean, why did he do this to himself?

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
You know what I mean?

50:32.000 --> 50:37.920
Like, well, I mean, you know, I say that when I know full well, the answer that sometimes

50:37.920 --> 50:39.580
being good, isn't good enough.

50:39.580 --> 50:43.800
You have to be the best, especially with the whole, you know, the movie and the drama and

50:43.800 --> 50:44.800
all that stuff.

50:44.800 --> 50:45.800
You know, I get it.

50:45.800 --> 50:49.840
And you know, I was, I was kind of bummed reading this because I got to meet Billy at

50:49.840 --> 50:56.680
the last Dragon Con because he's usually there signing autographs and whatever, doing his,

50:56.680 --> 50:59.440
you know, giving away his hot sauce and all that.

50:59.440 --> 51:03.560
According to SSJ100 Matt, he actually did put out a statement on YouTube.

51:03.560 --> 51:04.560
He did.

51:04.560 --> 51:06.960
And I was actually going to bring that up because I just haven't had a chance to listen

51:06.960 --> 51:07.960
to it.

51:07.960 --> 51:11.520
I read, there was an article that was run on it that had some little like bits and pieces

51:11.520 --> 51:12.520
from it.

51:12.520 --> 51:14.040
And of course I've since closed it.

51:14.040 --> 51:15.040
Darn it.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.280
The link is in the chat.

51:17.280 --> 51:21.560
The important question is, does his hot sauce have anything to do with Donkey Kong as far

51:21.560 --> 51:23.560
as the naming of his hot sauce.

51:23.560 --> 51:27.840
Although I think Donkey Kong isn't making him money.

51:27.840 --> 51:29.720
Twin Galaxies don't have money.

51:29.720 --> 51:35.640
But it can't hurt though to have a reputation from that and say, by the way, I'm selling

51:35.640 --> 51:36.640
this.

51:36.640 --> 51:37.640
Sure.

51:37.640 --> 51:38.640
Okay.

51:38.640 --> 51:39.640
So there is a whole YouTube thing.

51:39.640 --> 51:40.640
And he went on.

51:40.640 --> 51:41.640
Is it long?

51:41.640 --> 51:42.640
It's a minute and 10 seconds.

51:42.640 --> 51:43.640
You want me to play the whole thing?

51:43.640 --> 51:44.640
Why not?

51:45.240 --> 51:46.240
Let's let the man defend himself.

51:46.240 --> 51:51.280
I need to say this is courtesy YouTube just to make myself legally in the clear.

51:51.280 --> 51:54.640
This is courtesy of YouTube and the user account on YouTube.

51:54.640 --> 51:59.260
If you want to watch this for yourself is still loading on my hand because I have a

51:59.260 --> 52:01.600
slowest dirt computer here.

52:01.600 --> 52:08.120
It is Ryan Burger is the YouTube account that has posted this as a part of old school gamer

52:08.120 --> 52:09.120
magazine.

52:09.120 --> 52:10.120
Here it is.

52:10.120 --> 52:11.240
Hi, I'm Billy Mitchell.

52:11.240 --> 52:13.560
We're here at the Midwest Gaming Classic.

52:13.560 --> 52:16.320
I'm here with old school gamer magazine.

52:16.320 --> 52:20.280
I've been asked to address things that are recently in the media.

52:20.280 --> 52:28.200
The fact of the matter is now there is a true professional due diligence being done to investigate

52:28.200 --> 52:34.120
things that happened as far as 35 years ago in a professional manner, not in a shock jock

52:34.120 --> 52:36.880
mentality designed to create hits.

52:36.880 --> 52:41.960
We will show that everything that has been done, everything was done professionally.

52:42.360 --> 52:50.280
According to the rules, according to the scoreboard, the integrity that was set up, not 2014 forward

52:50.280 --> 52:54.680
by the current regime who wants to reach back 35 years.

52:54.680 --> 52:56.920
Everything will be transparent.

52:56.920 --> 52:57.920
Everything will be available.

52:57.920 --> 53:02.880
I wish I had it in my hands right now and wish I could hand it to you, but it's taken

53:02.880 --> 53:08.800
a considerable amount of time, witnesses, documents, everything will be made available

53:08.800 --> 53:09.800
to you.

53:09.800 --> 53:10.800
Nothing will be withheld.

53:11.240 --> 53:13.240
You absolutely have my commitment to that.

53:13.240 --> 53:19.240
We've been at this since 1982 and it's not going to stop now.

53:19.240 --> 53:20.240
So there it is.

53:20.240 --> 53:23.400
And that is again, courtesy of YouTube, old school gamer magazine.

53:23.400 --> 53:24.960
And I was very drunk.

53:24.960 --> 53:28.720
It was, well, it was a very, it was a lot of fluff because it's basically one of those,

53:28.720 --> 53:32.000
I don't have anything now, but I'm working on it type of things.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.040
Here's what I found most interesting in that whole little apology is, well, actually, no,

53:36.040 --> 53:37.040
I shouldn't say apology.

53:37.080 --> 53:42.520
The whole little, whatever it was, uh, is that he mentions the rules as they were set

53:42.520 --> 53:47.440
up 35 years ago, not 2014 through the current regime.

53:47.440 --> 53:53.220
So that, that struck me as very interesting is that he's taking issue with the way things

53:53.220 --> 53:55.700
have been run in the past couple of years.

53:55.700 --> 53:58.160
And like he feels that somehow the rules have changed.

53:58.160 --> 54:01.500
Although I would think in emulators, I think that's pretty consistent, but I would be very

54:01.500 --> 54:05.000
curious to see what he's going to come up with in this whole regard.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.800
So very interesting.

54:06.800 --> 54:09.360
Loki, anything you want to add to this?

54:09.360 --> 54:10.360
Nope.

54:10.360 --> 54:11.360
I know.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.360
It's like, what else?

54:12.360 --> 54:13.720
What else can you say?

54:13.720 --> 54:19.520
My gosh, just that, uh, Peter Dinklage sure did pull off quite the, uh, impression of

54:19.520 --> 54:22.040
him in pixels.

54:22.040 --> 54:23.040
Stop it.

54:23.040 --> 54:24.040
All right.

54:24.040 --> 54:25.040
Uh, let's see.

54:25.040 --> 54:27.880
S200 Matt and chat says document statements and everything will come out when I learned

54:27.880 --> 54:28.880
Photoshop.

54:28.880 --> 54:29.880
There you go.

54:29.880 --> 54:30.880
All right.

54:30.880 --> 54:33.600
Vid power calls it Kong gate over in our chat room.

54:33.600 --> 54:34.940
All right.

54:34.940 --> 54:35.940
Let's move on.

54:35.940 --> 54:41.440
You know, I just, it's, it's kind of drama and I just, I hope everybody can resolve this,

54:41.440 --> 54:42.500
but I do hope it's fair.

54:42.500 --> 54:48.340
You know, if he didn't do the score the right way, they didn't do the score the right way.

54:48.340 --> 54:49.340
And that's that.

54:49.340 --> 54:50.860
So, all right, let's move on.

54:50.860 --> 54:51.860
Loki.

54:51.860 --> 54:52.860
All right.

54:52.860 --> 54:53.980
So this is pretty awesome.

54:53.980 --> 55:00.700
So you may remember there's a whole backwards compatibility with Xbox 360 on the Xbox one.

55:00.700 --> 55:08.420
And now there's Xbox original backwards compatibility on the Xbox one as well.

55:08.420 --> 55:13.740
So they've just added, um, their first set of games, which released on April 17th.

55:13.740 --> 55:18.100
So blinks, the time sweeper breakdown, conquer live and reloaded, elder scrolls three Morrow

55:18.100 --> 55:24.240
in hunter, the reckoning Jade empire, Panzer Dragoon, orta, and SSX three.

55:24.240 --> 55:29.180
The second batch is actually coming out in a couple of weeks here on the 26th and you'll

55:29.180 --> 55:34.820
get destroy all humans, full spectrum warrior, mercenaries, playground of destruction, MX

55:34.820 --> 55:39.500
unleashed, Panzer elite action, fields of glory, star Wars, battlefront, the original

55:39.500 --> 55:40.980
service bell for it.

55:40.980 --> 55:45.900
And the original star was bell front to star Wars, Jedi Knight, Jedi Academy, star Wars,

55:45.900 --> 55:50.860
Jedi star fighter, star Wars, Knights of the older public to the Sith Lords and star Wars

55:50.860 --> 55:53.180
command or Republic commando.

55:53.180 --> 55:56.980
We'll all be backwards compatible at that time.

55:57.980 --> 56:02.980
So that's kind of pretty cool that they're still supporting this stuff, even systems

56:02.980 --> 56:04.660
like a couple of systems ago.

56:04.660 --> 56:05.660
Yeah.

56:05.660 --> 56:08.460
Can't say the same about certain other companies.

56:08.460 --> 56:12.780
And I'm talking right now, I'm talking both the other companies, you know, cause

56:12.780 --> 56:13.780
Good point.

56:13.780 --> 56:14.780
Yeah.

56:14.780 --> 56:15.780
Fair point.

56:15.780 --> 56:16.780
Yeah.

56:16.780 --> 56:17.780
And there's no virtual console still.

56:17.780 --> 56:21.460
Uh, so, uh, with the Xbox stuff though, I mean, it's not just about the fact that they

56:21.460 --> 56:26.280
can support games from 10 years ago, but the fact that they can resell them for a value

56:26.280 --> 56:31.300
that's much greater than what these games are going for at game used game places.

56:31.300 --> 56:34.700
So does that mean that with these games, like say star Wars, battlefront or battlefront

56:34.700 --> 56:39.200
too, that the multiplayer servers are back online because couldn't you go play multiplayer

56:39.200 --> 56:40.200
on these things still?

56:40.200 --> 56:42.940
Or I don't know the answer to that, unfortunately.

56:42.940 --> 56:46.620
Um, I think if they were running through EA servers, no, if they're running through

56:46.620 --> 56:51.280
Xbox live, they might work, but, um, I don't think they do.

56:51.280 --> 56:54.200
I think they were EA servers and I don't think they still run.

56:54.200 --> 56:57.720
So, um, but, uh, yeah, you do on steam.

56:57.720 --> 56:59.880
So if you go on steam and do it, there you go.

56:59.880 --> 57:03.480
But these games are nine 99 and pop, I think if you want to, but so like old Xbox first

57:03.480 --> 57:07.800
gen Xbox stuff for nine 99 and pop, I mean, you could probably find these discs for like

57:07.800 --> 57:11.520
four bucks, probably even less than a dollar.

57:11.520 --> 57:16.900
I mean, so if you do find them, that's great cause you have the value that you can play

57:16.900 --> 57:17.900
them here.

57:17.900 --> 57:21.160
But I mean, there is something to be said about getting these games to be backwards

57:21.160 --> 57:23.880
compatible so that they can sell them all over again, basically.

57:23.880 --> 57:29.200
On top of that, it's like, I think if Moro wins 15, I think there's charging even more

57:29.200 --> 57:30.200
from all right.

57:30.200 --> 57:35.680
And on top of all that, I mean, this is kind of like, you know, the totally not necessary.

57:35.680 --> 57:41.680
I mean, they didn't need to do this and the fact that they're doing it, this speak volumes.

57:41.680 --> 57:48.120
I kind of wish that Sony would fucking do something like anything, just, you can't tell

57:48.120 --> 57:49.120
me.

57:49.120 --> 57:52.460
And I mean, I know that they are, they're trying to resell their PlayStation one stuff

57:52.460 --> 57:55.520
like through, they have their own kind of inbuilt emulator stuff.

57:55.520 --> 57:57.900
So like I got in like twisted male black and stuff like that.

57:57.900 --> 58:03.260
And I guess that's PlayStation two, but, um, we've already seen the PlayStation two stuff

58:03.260 --> 58:05.020
up on their story, right?

58:05.020 --> 58:07.720
So they can do it, but it's just, they don't want to open it up.

58:07.720 --> 58:11.180
So they, Oh, you have a copy of twisted male black that it'll play just fine.

58:11.180 --> 58:13.060
Yeah, no, they don't want to do that.

58:13.060 --> 58:15.420
Uh, looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com.

58:15.420 --> 58:20.980
Rama says, fuck yes, conquer, uh, active says, Panzer Dragoon, or to finally, uh, Ray

58:20.980 --> 58:25.660
engineer says, say, Rob, Loki question, are the downloadable X-Box originals only compatible

58:25.660 --> 58:27.820
with certain models of the three 60.

58:27.820 --> 58:31.860
I bought three when I had my first three 60 and they worked then, but with my current

58:31.860 --> 58:37.020
three 60, they won't launch, you mean the X-Box one, but no, I think three 60 because

58:37.020 --> 58:42.180
you can play X-Box originals and X-Box three 60 remember the emulator and that kid, it

58:42.180 --> 58:43.180
works just fine.

58:43.180 --> 58:45.400
As long as you have the backwards compatibility data in there.

58:45.400 --> 58:47.380
So you have to have like a hard drive in there.

58:47.380 --> 58:51.220
So if you have an old like core system that does not have a hard drive, then you don't

58:51.220 --> 58:52.420
have that.

58:52.420 --> 58:57.220
But if you have, you know, a hard drive in, I think you required a 20 gig hard drive at

58:57.220 --> 58:58.700
least to be able to do that stuff.

58:58.700 --> 58:59.700
Yeah.

58:59.700 --> 59:02.820
Um, cause you have to download the backwards compatibility data in order to do it.

59:02.820 --> 59:06.300
But I think that they all should be compatible.

59:06.300 --> 59:07.300
Yeah.

59:07.300 --> 59:11.580
I haven't heard anything about different three 60 models being compatible, but you're right

59:11.580 --> 59:12.580
on the hard drive thing.

59:12.580 --> 59:14.180
The hard drive thing is the requirement there.

59:14.180 --> 59:17.620
I would say if that still is not working for you, we're agent or you should probably

59:17.620 --> 59:21.020
contact a Microsoft tech support and see what they can do.

59:21.020 --> 59:22.020
Yeah.

59:22.020 --> 59:23.020
Maybe it's a license transfer thing.

59:23.020 --> 59:25.780
So just as a show on her mat, that's a very good thought there.

59:25.780 --> 59:28.340
Rama says, tweet to X-Box about that.

59:28.340 --> 59:31.900
Microsoft is pretty responsive on Twitter, but I would honestly just go direct to their

59:31.900 --> 59:36.540
like help thing and submit a formal ticket that way and have them look into it if it

59:36.540 --> 59:37.540
still won't work.

59:37.540 --> 59:39.620
But yeah, uh, look at the hard drive thing.

59:39.620 --> 59:43.220
Look at the license transfer thing that those could both be issues why that's not still

59:43.220 --> 59:44.220
working.

59:44.220 --> 59:49.820
Anyway, moving on to something that's a little bit rumors, but before I read rumors, I know,

59:49.820 --> 59:53.620
but it's one of those things where I kind of look at it and go, does this sound plausible?

59:53.620 --> 59:54.620
You know, I love that.

59:54.620 --> 59:56.420
We need to play Fleetwood Mac during this.

59:56.420 --> 59:59.340
Well, Fleetwood Mac, they kind of broke up.

59:59.340 --> 01:00:00.340
Yeah.

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.340
They just fired Lindsey Bunkingham.

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.340
I know.

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:06.880
It's like right before they went on their big, like all reunion, all of us do to fuck

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.300
this up.

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.740
Stevie Nicks and Lindsey had to be in the same room together.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.740
That's what, I guess that's it.

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:17.380
They did a bad strain of something and this is that.

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.380
All right.

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:25.060
Anyway, uh, no, they're aged now probably a bad strain of kombucha anyway.

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.060
That's so accurate.

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.060
All right.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:30.740
Anyway, uh, this is a rumor regarding theme parks.

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:34.220
We all know that Nintendo super Nintendo world is a thing that's coming to the universal

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.140
studios theme parks pretty soon.

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:41.260
However, now, uh, one of the big news networks, ABC, I don't know if that's the ABC here in

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:43.300
the U S I'm imagine it must be not the Australia one.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:47.860
I think it is the ABC here because it is about universal studios, Orlando, apparently a Pokemon

01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:50.540
theme park is coming to universal studios, Orlando.

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:55.180
This is because of sources that talked to ABC saying that Pokemon park will be part

01:00:55.180 --> 01:01:02.360
of the kids zone section universal right now, woody woodpecker and Barney are located there.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:07.100
So I would imagine those guys are getting evicted in favor of Pokemon.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:09.900
Uh, it sounds like Barney might be taken out back and shot.

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.900
That would be pretty great.

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:14.020
I think a lot of us that grew up in the nineties would appreciate that they're going to put

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.020
Barney down.

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:17.500
Are you excited to hear that?

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.500
Loki?

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:23.500
Um, you know, I hated Barney back when it was fun to hate Barney, but actually Barney's

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.500
not terrible.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:29.820
So actually having the kids watch it, but, um, yeah, I really don't care.

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.220
Yeah, my kids are outgrown Barney anyways.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:36.140
Anyway, originally there was going to be a Mario cart and donkey Kong roller coaster

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:40.820
here, but that is going to move and that will be on the universal 400 acres that they

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.060
just bought near Kirkman Avenue across the street.

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:48.520
That is going to be home to universal's fourth park and Nintendo is going to be part of that

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.520
park.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.540
Nintendo holds the trademark for Pokemon that is going to be part of a plan to have Nintendo

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:57.100
at all the properties, kind of like Harry Potter.

01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.100
So there you go.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:00.340
I still haven't been to Harry Potter land either.

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:02.660
Oh girl, you got to go where you're down there.

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:07.220
I know, but I'm, I've got, I'm flying back on Tuesday so I can see where it out.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.220
Okay.

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:12.100
So we are planning a trip at some point where like we drive down Friday, we go to universal

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:16.900
Saturday because miss Victoria from shaking and crying is there and she, she lives like

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.220
five minutes away from universal.

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:20.780
So not to give out her address, but she said it on the show.

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:23.460
So she lives like five minutes from universal so she can meet us there.

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.660
I know she will.

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:29.980
And any, any excuse for her to dress up, I'll have to find my, um, actually order my Slytherin

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:34.220
roads and then we'll drive back on Sunday and do the show or we'll do the show live

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.220
from the car.

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.220
Yeah.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:39.460
Wouldn't be the worst thing we've done.

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:40.460
Live from I-5.

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:41.460
All right.

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:42.460
Anyway, I think that's the thing that has to happen.

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:43.460
Not the five.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:50.220
We take the 99 more stops and, and the, um, the crab, why did I always forget the name

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:51.220
of it?

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.220
The cheese.

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:53.220
Oh, the Bravo farm.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.300
Bravo cheese farm.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:55.740
They have Bravo farms on I-5 now.

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:56.740
But I don't care.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:57.740
You have to go the original.

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:02.020
Or anyway, same place where they have a Starbucks.

01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:04.020
Dungeon buster says butter beer is tasty.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.020
Heck yeah.

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:08.760
One of my buddies was at universal this weekend actually.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.660
And I'm like, send me pictures that make me jealous.

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:14.540
So of course I get like the butter beer dessert thing from the Harry Potter restaurant and

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:18.100
I'm like, Oh, I'm so hateful.

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:20.780
Anyway, I think this is the thing we have to do to our soccer.

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:24.900
I have decided my birthday's coming up and yes, I'm going to Chicago, but my birthday,

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:25.900
I'm 40 this year.

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:26.900
God damn it.

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:29.060
I want to go to a theme park for my birthday.

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.340
Like after before.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.620
All right.

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:34.620
We should make it happen.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.620
I think so.

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:36.620
That's what I want.

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.620
You know what?

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:40.300
Well, speaking by the way, I need to bring this up at some point.

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:46.380
I'm actually glad I said the word birthday because we need to acknowledge that dark soccer's

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.500
birthday is Thursday.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.500
Yes, it is.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.180
So dark soccer is turning 29 all over again.

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:53.180
Just like Bobby Black Wolf.

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:54.180
No, I'm not.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.180
No.

01:03:55.180 --> 01:04:01.380
And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what I like being where I am and getting carded for number

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.380
one.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.060
I got carded today buying Guinness.

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:09.160
Like yeah, my skin looks better than I did as a teenager.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.760
People don't believe it's me.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:16.540
So I'm fine with my illusion, but I'm glad that I'm not 29 for all the fucking bullshit

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.680
that happened in my twenties.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.420
Life got better when I turned 30.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:21.420
Oh yeah.

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.420
No, my thirties.

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:24.520
The older I get, the less of a fuck I give.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.500
I'm actually welcoming 40 because my thirties have been way better than my twenties.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.460
I can't believe you're still not 40.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.460
It's coming up.

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:33.660
Well, I mean, remember this show has been around for 16 years.

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.660
Okay.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.740
So when the show started, I was 24.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:41.100
I just in the thing, and I'll go ahead and fucking say it, I'm going to be 42 and I don't

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.100
care.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:45.500
Well, and because it is the answer to everything, I will be the answer to life, the universe

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.500
and everything.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.500
That's right.

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.500
But the thing is, you know what?

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.980
Billy Mitchell's older than you are and he's got more drama.

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:53.340
But here's the thing about it.

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:56.980
I still like all the stuff I did in my twenties.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:58.820
I still enjoy myself.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:03.980
I don't fucking feel like I thought I would feel in my forties.

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:07.500
I've done things to improve my health.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:13.200
You know, I've I mean, fuck, I've dropped 40 is the new 70.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:17.180
I've dropped 76 pounds since October.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:23.660
And I'm happy as long as I don't end up, you know, in the same situation my mother is in.

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.540
I think I'll be okay.

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:28.340
You know, my life is a success.

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:29.860
I have a great job.

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:30.860
I have a great husband.

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:31.860
I have a great cat.

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:32.860
I have wonderful friends.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:33.860
And you have great friends.

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:34.860
Holla.

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:35.860
Right.

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:42.300
And I wish that for everyone to make it to the same point that I have and feel as I wouldn't

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:46.740
say successful because success is personal, but feel satisfied.

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:50.260
And I feel satisfied with my life and I would like for everyone to have that same feeling

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.260
of satisfaction.

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:57.340
But the only thing that I want on my birthday is to play more video games is a cupcake,

01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:04.020
a carrot cake, carrot cake cupcake with no fucking raisins in it.

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:09.260
Raisins are the wire hangers of my soul.

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.260
Fuck that noise.

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.260
All right.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.460
Well, I hope I hope you get that cupcake.

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.460
Thank you.

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:15.460
I would bake it if I baked.

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:16.460
But I don't.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:18.980
I'm just going to say I don't I don't bake and I bake it for you.

01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:23.760
So you know what you let me find a place with cupcakes.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.780
We can go there together and I will buy you the fucking cake with no raisins.

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.700
And I think I'm going to go see you ready player one that night.

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.020
You should do it.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.020
I deserve it.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:35.440
Link in our chat over at live dot vog network dot com MXC says great to hear as someone

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.980
nearing 30.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.500
Fifth Dream says I'm 44 in three weeks.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.840
So you know, we got we got some 40 year olds.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:47.000
Act Def says I've been listening to OLR since I was 24 and that was around 11 years ago.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Let's see.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.820
SSJ 100 Matt in chat says Rob is going to turn into Sally O'Malley from the Saturday

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:55.020
Night Live skit when he turns 50.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:56.740
Cuz I'm 50.

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:59.220
That was a great character at Molly Shannon.

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:00.420
I love it.

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.540
All right.

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:05.020
And then everybody in chat is complaining about raisins.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.900
I don't see raisins are deceptive little motherfuckers.

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:09.900
I like raisins.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:11.980
However, I will look.

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:13.960
I'm going to give the anti raisin crowd this.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.580
I'm going to give them two things.

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:18.320
First off, craisins are superior in every way.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.940
They are second occurrence.

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:26.220
Second off, I too get really pissed off when I'm like, is that a chocolate chip cookie?

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:29.420
And I bite into it and it's fucking oatmeal raisins, right?

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:34.840
Raisins are the assholes to sever raisins are the Trump of the cookie world.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.460
I'm However, however, no, this is important.

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:38.460
This is important.

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.460
Let me finish.

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:44.060
Like I let you finish.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:47.340
If you tell me it's an oatmeal raisin cookie up front.

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:48.380
And so I am prepared.

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:52.780
My palate is ready to like, okay, this is going to be a raisin thing.

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:53.780
And then I eat that.

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:54.780
I'm fine.

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:55.780
I'm fine.

01:07:55.780 --> 01:08:00.580
Loki, you just don't put, just don't put raisins in baked goods.

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:05.080
You can have reasons by themselves or even, I guess it's fine if it's like in a brand

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:09.820
muffin or something like that, but like anything else, they should not be in there.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:10.820
You know what?

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:14.600
What would be good in oatmeal cookies is currents.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.600
Currents would be good or quick.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:22.560
I've had craisin oatmeal cookies and those were delicious, but no raisins are terrible.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:25.600
And the reason why I call them the Trump of the cookie world is because they're deceptive

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.280
lying assholes that are shriveled and need to not exist in my universe.

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:34.640
Fuck the assholes at the goddamn grocery store who put the chocolate chip bagels right next

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.880
to the raisin bagels.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.480
That's like right next to each other.

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.480
It's like, dude.

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.480
Okay.

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.480
Here's the thing.

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.480
Now you, you, okay.

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.480
We are a video game show.

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:45.720
I promise we'll get back to video games.

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.160
However, this is important.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.880
When it comes to bagels, chocolate chips and bagels.

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.880
Really?

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.880
Yes.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:54.880
No, no, no.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:55.880
Chocolate buns and everything.

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:56.880
No, no, no.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.280
Raisins and bagels are superior.

01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.280
Ew.

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.280
No.

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.280
That's disgusting.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.200
Especially when it's cinnamon raisin.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.080
Raisins are, I hate cinnamon raisin stuff.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.080
You know what?

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.080
This is going to make me mad.

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.080
You know what?

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.080
You take the mayonnaise.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.080
I'll take the cinnamon raisin.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.080
Done.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.080
You can have that fucking bagel chip.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.720
Raisins and ketchup and yellow mustard.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:14.960
All three in the same category.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:18.240
You can have that mayo chop, that disgusting vile substance that's been all over Twitter

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:19.240
this week.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.240
I don't like ketchup.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.240
So that's going to be disgusting.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.240
Mayo chop?

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.240
Yeah.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.240
Heinz is making...

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.240
Heinz is making its base.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.800
It's mayonnaise plus ketchup in a single bottle.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.800
That's what it is.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.400
Who makes his mayo and ketchup?

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.400
Kids do.

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.400
Europeans.

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.400
Belgians.

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.800
Like, that's my actual answer, actually.

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:43.480
Well, Belgians do the superior thing of using mayonnaise for fries, but I will tell you

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.480
this.

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.480
I'm going to go to Disneyland on that Monday.

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:52.600
I'm going to get a carrot cake churro, but their dipping sauce is cream cheese raisin,

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:56.560
and I am just going to take every bit of raisin out of that nastiness.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:01.240
You should, without breaking eye contact with the person running the cart, pick up the little

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.880
dip that they give you, extend your hand over the trash and throw it in, and then turn around

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.880
and walk away.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880
It's not their fault.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:12.040
I am not the, can I speak to your manager, bitch?

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.600
Are you sure?

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.600
Cause, girl.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.600
No.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.960
The, can I speak to your manager, bitch, is when I'm dealing with pure incompetence.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.640
Not when it's something that's a policy they can't do shit about.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.640
I'm allergic to raisins.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.640
Can you please give me some without?

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.640
They don't, they're pre-done.

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.640
They're all like that.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.640
Oh, yeah.

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:33.800
What if you said, oh my gosh, I'm allergic to raisins, and the Disney magic is being

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.800
ruined for me?

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.800
Like, they would find something anyway.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.800
I demand magic!

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.560
Dungeon Busters, even Jamie's laughing.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:48.880
Dungeon Buster chat over at live.fognetwork.com says, hey, this is still about gaming.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.800
Remember the California raisins had their own video game?

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:52.800
Yes.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:53.800
It was annoying too.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:54.800
Okay.

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.000
I never played it because the California raisins kind of scared me when I was a kid.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.240
Now, VidPower is saying that ketchup and mayo is fry sauce, but that is not entirely true

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:08.120
because I have had fry sauce that, yes, it did contain ketchup and mayo, but that's not

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.120
all that goes into proper fry sauce.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.400
Thousand Island also has relish, right?

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.280
That's, Thousand Island isn't fry sauce either.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.280
Oh.

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.280
I thought fry sauce was just ketchup and mayo.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.560
I thought that really was just fry sauce.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.960
Not where I'm from, no.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.960
Oh, okay.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:22.960
That's localized versions.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:23.960
Anyway, we got to move on.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.960
Hey, hey, we got more games, video games.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.040
Dark Soccer, in fact, it's your turn, and you have-

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.600
A mouthful of food.

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.080
And Sega stuff though, right?

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.080
Give me a second.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.080
Okay.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.080
Quickly-

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.080
I thought I had a chance to take a bite.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.080
Okay.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.040
What's your favorite Sega game?

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.040
Quick, Logie.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.040
Favorite Sega game?

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.040
Oh, my favorite Sega game?

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.480
I didn't really have a lot of Sega games.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.800
I'd say probably-

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.800
Fancy Star Online.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:48.800
Shadow Dancer.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.800
All right.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.800
That is a good game.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.560
Actually, it wasn't Shadow Dancer.

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:56.920
That was on Genesis because that was-

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.920
It was Genesis.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.920
Yeah.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.880
I'm thinking Dreamcast for some reason.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.080
My brain went right into Dreamcast games.

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.080
That's all right.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.080
Well, that's obviously Power Stone or Power Stone 2.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.080
Powerful.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.080
That was a Capcom game.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.080
Anyway, story.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.080
All right.

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:18.080
So Sega has had mercy on those of us who love our Switches, especially those of us who didn't

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:25.080
pay for them, and we are going to be getting 15 titles under the new Sega Ages lineup.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.080
Three were confirmed.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:33.080
Studio M2 is doing these, so we are going to be getting, for these titles, it looks

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:38.080
like, if this thing wasn't completely out of order, I'd be able to tell everybody.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:52.080
Fantasy Star, and I hope that it's as good as the Sega Ages 2800 ones, like what came

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:56.080
out on PS2, because I will be super happy, because I had to play that in Japanese with

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.080
a guide on that game.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.080
Oh, they're doing Sonic the Hedgehog and Thunder Force 4.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:06.080
It would be cool if they did do, like, the full, you know, upgrade package like they

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.080
did with the Sega Ages 2800, but we'll see.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:12.080
But it'd be nice for a lot of people who had never gotten to play the original Fantasy

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.080
Star, you know, which was a Sega Master System game.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.080
It'd be really great.

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.080
And Thunder Force 4, I mean, that ain't, that ain't crap.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.080
So, pretty good.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:23.080
Hopefully we'll get a list of what the other ones are.

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.080
Isn't it weird, though, yet again, we just had the SNK thing last week.

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.080
Not that I'm complaining, mind you.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.080
This is not a complaint.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.080
However, it is a little weird to me that we had that last week, and now we have this,

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.080
and it's like, wait a minute.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:38.080
Aren't these companies supposed to be saving this stuff for Virtual Console?

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:44.080
Like, so Virtual Console is clearly something the third, well, Virtual Console is not Virtual

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.080
Console anymore.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.080
We're not having a Virtual Console anymore.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.080
There is no Virtual Console.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.080
Whatever Nintendo is planning for the retro stuff is something new, and it's something

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.080
for them, where third parties aren't allowed.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.080
Yeah.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.080
It is what it is.

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.080
That's where we're at right now.

01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:02.080
Well, in other news, though, and I don't know how to feel about this, but Sega, for

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:10.080
the 30th anniversary of the Mega Drive, or as we had at the Genesis, they're doing a

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:17.080
Mega Drive Mini, and it looks like, I had the list, I thought I had the list of games

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:23.080
on here, but they're going to be doing a good number of games on it, except it's not going

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:28.080
to be, though, built by Sega, because Sega doesn't actually do any of their own console

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.080
stuff anymore.

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.080
I'm a little bit worried.

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:36.080
I had the list of the company that was doing this, like AT something, and I don't know

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:42.080
what their track record is, so, but all the Nintendo stuff was done in-house, so I'm just

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.080
a little bit, a little bit leery.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.080
I'll wait and see.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:51.080
I'd really want to see how the emulation is on them, because the Nintendo ones were perfect.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:56.080
Well, clearly this is happening because of the success of the NES, but the thing is,

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.080
those Genesis flashback things have been around forever.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.080
What's going to make this special?

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.080
Well, and the earlier ones were really terrible.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.080
Their emulation was absolute garbage.

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.080
You know, they really are going to have to make this something else.

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:14.080
Yeah, but for Sega, because they kind of licensed this out to sub parties before, I think they're

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:17.080
really going to have to step it up with this to be impressive.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.080
They're going to have to step their pussies up.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.080
That's right.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.080
Alright, just a couple more stories before we get to a real classic game of the week

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:24.080
here in a moment.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.080
Loki.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.080
Alright, so this is kind of interesting.

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.080
So, it's always going to take, like, hackers to add that, you know, additional feature

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:34.080
that we really wish was there.

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:43.080
So apparently, someone had to exploit a flaw in the Switch to add save backups to the Switch,

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.080
which is kind of interesting.

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:54.080
And so, basically, the guy, he rewrote Checkpoint to work with the Switch and using its user

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:59.080
interface and everything, and they actually have, like, some screenshots of backing up

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:02.080
saves to work with the Switch hardware.

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.080
It's kind of interesting.

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:12.080
They said previously, you know, the 3DS and Wii U are cracked enough to suffer piracy

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:18.080
problems, but, you know, the Switch has not really had that issue yet, so they've kind

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.080
of avoided that.

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:25.080
But really, yeah, they should just add basic features to their, you know, console, because

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:30.080
it would be nice to be able to back the stuff up, or at least cloud saves might be nice.

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.080
I mean, I guess I understand, you know, you're not expected to have multiple systems, but

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.080
if the system dies, all your stuff's there.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:41.080
Well, maybe when they start charging people for online, cloud saves is one of those things

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:45.080
that could kind of be, you know, part of the reason why they're charging money for it.

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.080
That would be cool.

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.080
Or at least just allowing you to back it up would be nice.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.080
Yeah, for sure.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:54.080
But, when you can't do what you want with your hardware, hackers gonna hack, right?

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:55.080
Right.

01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:00.080
All right, and when you do things you're not supposed to be doing, when the government

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:03.080
has passed rules about it, they will sometimes fine you and slap you on the wrist.

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:06.080
And that's what's happening in South Korea.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:13.080
The South Korean Fair Trade Commission fined three game publishers over misleading odds

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.080
for loot boxes in the games.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:18.080
See, so even though they have that kind of regulation, they're just gonna exploit it

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.080
because the fine's less than the money they're gonna make.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.080
But now they've been called out, and that's pretty bad when the government has to come

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.080
in and do that.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:30.080
Netmarble, Nextfloor, and Nexon, which they do games here.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.080
The Nexon does a lot of stuff.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.080
They are huge for free-to-play games over in Asia.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:39.080
They are being penalized because they have violated the Electronic Commerce Act.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:44.080
This all according to the Korean Herald that said that they all took issue with the way

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:48.080
that these three companies were advertising odds of loot boxes in their games.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.080
One example was a game called Celebrity Count.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.080
Oh no, the Celebrity Count event in Sudden Attack.

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.080
Nexon's ads showed that anyone who bought a loot box had a chance to get a puzzle piece,

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:02.080
and then on collecting all 16 pieces, players would get an in-game benefit.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:06.080
But the odds of actually receiving a puzzle piece was as low as 0.5%,

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:09.080
and that was something Nexon did not disclose.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:17.080
So Nexon got an $882,700 penalty and then fined for $5,200.

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:20.080
This is the largest of all the three publishers that I mentioned.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:26.080
The publisher said that they used the phrase random provision to suggest that odds would be different.

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:29.080
They disagreed with the FTC's interpretation.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.080
You know what? I'm glad the government slapped him in the face then,

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.080
because don't fucking dance around with this fucking vocabulary.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:43.080
You know what, Nexon? Suck it up and publish the actual odds or not get the fuck off,

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:47.080
which I know you're not going to do because these free-to-play games are everywhere in Asia.

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:55.080
So anyway, Netmarble made a game called Marvel Future Fight and Star Wars Force Arena,

01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:01.080
and then Destiny Child, not to be confused with the band of the same name that reunited last night,

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:07.080
Next Floor makes this game. They were hit with a much smaller fine, just $4,700.

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:11.080
Netmarble, they did reveal the odds, but they weren't accurate.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.080
That's kind of interesting, so...

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.080
I mean, they lied. Lies!

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.080
Yeah, yeah. So, Liza Minnelli lies.

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:21.080
So, interesting to see how this loot box stuff is all going.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.080
You know, it didn't make the show roll tonight,

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:31.080
but I remember seeing a story about how EA is kind of seeing how they're being perceived out there by the mass market.

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:35.080
I'm going to be very curious to see what EA's games looked like this holiday, after last holiday.

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.080
I know you're not convinced, Loki.

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.080
Yeah.

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:40.080
But I think EA's kind of come out and said,

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.080
okay, we realize people don't like us.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.080
Like, that was the sense I was getting.

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:47.080
They realize that this year we haven't liked them for several years.

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:50.080
Well, but this year is when they really felt it in the pocketbook.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:56.080
Okay, yeah. I'm sure this year they'll totally see light and totally change.

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.080
It's not going to be just nothing ever again.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.080
I don't know. I don't trust them at all.

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:07.080
Alright. Well, let's travel back to a simpler time when there was no loot boxes.

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:10.080
You know what? You could type in a code in the cartridge.

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.080
They had loot boxes. They were the grab bags at Sanrio.

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:17.080
That's right. It's the classic game of the week

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.080
where Dark Soccer's going to step into the gaming vault

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:24.080
and find a game that she thinks, hey, you brats, you should check this game out.

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.080
This one might be a hard one, right?

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.080
This is an import-only game you picked this week, right?

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:32.080
It is, and it has the distinction of being the first game I ever imported

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:37.080
when I lived in Alabama, and I paid $120 for this fucker COD.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.080
Wow. Okay. That's pretty impressive.

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.080
So there's your Notability tonight.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.080
It's the first game Jamie ever imported.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.080
Yes.

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.080
Alright, what is the classic game of the week?

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:50.080
Shoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S Joe Gairanto Shakyusou Satsuden.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.080
Sousatsu-sen. Sorry, not Satsuden.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:55.080
Okay, I recognize two words in there. Sailor Moon.

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:56.080
Yes.

01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:59.080
So this is the Sailor Moon S game.

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:04.080
It was a fighting game that came out on Super Famicom done by Angel Studios in 1994.

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:10.080
I imported my copy probably just after I graduated high school.

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.080
It is a fighting game.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:18.080
It has all of the inner and outer Senshi except for Sailor Saturn.

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:22.080
It also has Chibi Moon's Flying Butt Attack,

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:26.080
which basically we would just play Chibi Moon the whole time and do the Flying Butt Attack.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.080
You have four different modes.

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:33.080
You have a practice mode where you can practice the attacks for no damage.

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:39.080
You have tournament mode, which is an eight-character fight for a knockout tournament,

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:44.080
one to eight players being human and the others being CPU characters.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.080
You have versus mode where you just fight one-on-one, standard versus.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:54.080
And you have story mode where it's the Sailor Senshi fighting to choose a new leader.

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:59.080
In this mode, the inner Senshi and Sailor Chibi Moon are all playable.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:03.080
You have to defeat the other eight normally playable Senshi to win.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:06.080
And if you succeed, then the title screen changes

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:09.080
so that the silhouette that's on the top pillar

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:13.080
you know the intro for Sailor Moon where the top pillar has Sailor Moon on it

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:19.080
would be the one who wins and then Tuxedo Kamen shows up on the continue screen if you lose.

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:22.080
There are different stages in it.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.080
There is the Hikawa Shrine for Sailor Mars,

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:28.080
the Jubun Shopping District for Sailor Jupiter,

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:30.080
the Time Space Door for Pluto,

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.080
Moon Castle for Sailor Moon,

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.080
the Water Fountain at the park during the day for Sailor Mercury,

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:38.080
and the one at night for Sailor Uranus,

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.080
Seaside Port for Sailor Neptune,

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.080
Crystal Tokyo during the day for Chibi Moon,

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.080
Crystal Tokyo at night for Sailor Venus,

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:48.080
and then there is a hidden stage that's inside of an office building.

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:52.080
And the workers get up from their cubicles and cheer you on.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:58.080
I like this game a lot because I had just gotten into the real Sailor Moon,

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.080
not the dubs that we got over here,

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:04.080
but I started getting fan subs and watching them.

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:07.080
So it was really fun for me.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:10.080
This music here that we're hearing in the background,

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.080
this is background music from the show.

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.080
Just little background scene music.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.080
The intro is the Sailor Moon intro.

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:27.080
See? It even has all of the little phrases and everything.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.080
It just really makes me happy.

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:33.080
One thing I did know is that the sprites in this game

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:36.080
were actually recycled from the Sailor Moon R game developed by Bondai.

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:42.080
They just retouched from the first game that Angel actually did.

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:45.080
So it's a little bit of recycling and rehashing,

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.080
but the game I thought was fun.

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.080
I always wish I had gotten the Super's game

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.080
because it was a little bit more robust,

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:54.080
and you could play as Saturn as well, but oh well.

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:56.080
This is what I had access to,

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:58.080
and I broke a game genie so I could play this game

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.080
before I realized you could just cut the tabs out inside the machine.

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:05.080
So there you go. 1994 in all of its glory.

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.080
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.080
The Sailor Moon fighting game.

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.080
Sailor Moon S fighting game.

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.080
Which by the way, I do notice in our chat,

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:17.080
VidPower says they're actually having a mini side tournament

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.080
for the Super Nintendo Sailor Moon game at EVO this year.

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:23.080
Which Sailor Moon game though? There were several fighting games.

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.080
This one.

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:26.080
This one? Huh, fun.

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.080
I'm surprised it's not the Super's one,

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.080
because that one is a newer game.

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.080
It came out in 96.

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.080
Wait, let me look at the official tweet.

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.080
Just to make sure we don't have any confusion going on.

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.080
I'm going to leave the official tweet.

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.080
And there's the little...

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:43.080
I think this is it?

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:46.080
I don't know, there's all these logos here I can't see.

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.080
Oh yeah, there it is. The Sailor Moon S right there at the bottom.

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:50.080
Okay. Interesting.

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:53.080
It's not a bad game, I just think the Super's one is better.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.080
Alright, we're going to take a quick break,

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.080
but don't go anywhere because we've got more Orange Lounge Radio to come,

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.080
including rapid fire news.

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.080
We've got the mailbag tonight.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.080
We also have your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:08.080
All when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:17.080
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:20.080
Live on Sunday, April the 15th, 2018,

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:24.080
with episode 726 of our show already in progress

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.080
with myself, DarkSakura, and Loki all here in studio.

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.080
And some of you guys in our chat room,

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.080
those of you that are a little more techy at things

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:33.080
and know how to get in some other ways,

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:37.080
unfortunately our main chat applet at live.vognetwork.com

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:40.080
ain't working, but I've seen some alternative ideas in our Discord,

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.080
and also I retweeted one sent to us by Anime Jam Session.

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:47.080
I guess their chat applet's a little different and is letting people in,

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.080
so you have some other ideas if you want to get in and say hello

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.080
and chat with us here on the show tonight.

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:56.080
So I have to say, so one of our pals here at Orange Lounge Radio,

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.080
JD, who hasn't been on the show in a little while,

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.080
but he's going to be, he's visiting in I think two weeks.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:02.080
So he'll be here, but he's tweeting right now.

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:06.080
He is at a DDR drag show right now.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:09.080
And so, and I think I remember seeing ads for this.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.080
It's some of the, one of the gals from Dragula,

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.080
which kind of like, it's not Drag Race,

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:18.080
but it's like the monster drag, is doing like a DDR rock show themed thing.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.080
Even Loki, I could show this to you.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.080
Look at this, look at this. This is one of them.

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:25.080
She's dressed up right now as like that robot character from DDR.

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.080
That's pretty rad, right?

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.080
Yeah.

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.080
So that's, that's super.

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.080
Zukin?

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:30.080
Yeah, Zukin, that's it.

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:34.080
And then this one's, one of these other gals is dressed up as Storm,

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.080
but she's throwing Starburst to cartoon heroes.

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.080
Remember?

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:38.080
Drag is art.

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:41.080
That's right. This is art. Art, people.

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.080
Who likes art? Art, art.

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:46.080
Speaking of DDR, I didn't mention it during my gaming week,

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.080
but I'll mention it now since that whole DDR drag queen made me think of it.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:53.080
I got to play a DDR third mix Korean this weekend

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:56.080
because I quickly dropped in and visit Mel B

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.080
and they have the machine in their garage.

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:00.080
So I got to play that.

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.080
It was funny because I tweeted it and somebody was like,

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:04.080
oh, did you finally go visit Loki's machine?

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.080
I'm like, no, this is the third mix Korean.

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:11.080
Well, yeah, I have to get, they have a DVD drive you can get for it

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:13.080
because it normally has a CD drive.

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.080
And then there's a universal bootleg thing that you can get that basically

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:20.080
it's 10 mixes you can swap in and out.

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:24.080
So they have third, it's everything up through extreme.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.080
So they have like dancing stage, Euro mix and stuff like that.

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:30.080
Disney's rave that you can put on there.

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:33.080
I would want a fourth plus.

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.080
That would be the one I want.

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:38.080
I kind of, you guys, I really want a DDR machine.

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:41.080
I think I need to get one. I really do.

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:45.080
So borrow a couple of our pinballs so we can have room for DDR.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.080
I kind of want a fourth mix plus more than anything right now.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.080
We've actually got to clear out room because Dan's Mustang is coming home.

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:56.080
Whatever you get, you can always change it out really easy.

01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.080
Yeah, that's true. That's true.

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.080
So I think that's what they did too.

01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.080
I think it was an extreme and they changed it to a third Korean.

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.080
I need to get, I keep looking at my marquee because my marquee is bootleg as fuck.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.080
I need to get a new marquee.

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:11.080
You can have an official second mix.

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:15.080
No, I don't want to take our marquee.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.080
No, I need to actually get something for mine.

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.080
But look, it has a little Konami sticker.

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.080
It's official.

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.080
You know what I have at home, right?

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.080
I have the second mixed up book.

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.080
Oh yeah, because of the Dreamcast version, right?

01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:32.080
No, it's the arcade book.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:34.080
Oh, that's cool. I thought it came with something.

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:36.080
No, it's actually a strategy guide.

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.080
A Japanese strategy guide.

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:41.080
Gotcha. Anyway, cool.

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.080
So yeah, I got to play that a little bit.

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.080
And that was fun because I got to play Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick,

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.080
which I don't think I've played on a machine in like five years easy at least.

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.080
So that was fun.

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.080
So DDR memories, good times.

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:57.080
I would only want third Korean just for Stump to my beat, but you know.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.080
Here's my problem is that we still rent this house.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:03.080
So like if I get a DDR machine, that machine is going to have to be moved at some point.

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:05.080
And that's going to be a terror.

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:06.080
You know what I mean?

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:10.080
It's not as hard moving it as you would think.

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.080
They're all in casters.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:16.080
Having done that, it only takes a couple.

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:18.080
As a DDR machine owner.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:22.080
Yes, having much recently moved the DDR machine,

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:26.080
it's actually not as hard as you would think.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:29.080
But it does take up a lot of space, so that is true.

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:33.080
Let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki.

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.080
So apparently Ikaruga is going to be coming to the Switch.

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:42.080
Or at least that seems to be the case because of a picture that was tweeted out.

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:44.080
And it looks pretty awesome.

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:47.080
So Treasure did tweet that out.

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:53.080
And on top of that, they also showed that it looks like it may have a vertical mode option as well.

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:58.080
Because the screenshot shows kind of it running both in horizontal and vertical.

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.080
So neat.

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:02.080
Ikaruga and all the platforms.

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:05.080
I'm glad they're doing vertical for Ikaruga.

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:09.080
I had said this on OLR. Why aren't they doing more shooters with vertical mode?

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:11.080
And I think vertical mode is good.

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:15.080
That other pinball, not pinball FX3, but the stern pinball, just got vertical mode.

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:21.080
The only problem with vertical mode on that is just that how do you set the screen up.

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:25.080
Because it's kind of awkward. You kind of have to balance it against something.

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.080
The kickstand doesn't do that.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:31.080
You take off the left controller and you just use the right controller.

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:36.080
You don't stand it up. You just hold it in your hand and it's the right amount of counterbalance.

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.080
Because you're holding it in your hand with the right controller and it doesn't bend or anything.

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:41.080
It's fine.

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:44.080
I've played some of the pinball FX. It works.

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:50.080
I think I've seen something that was mocked up where it's basically a holder for the system.

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:53.080
But it's vertical and then you put the controllers on the side.

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:57.080
Kind of like a controller dock but it has enough tension to hold the screen in there.

01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:59.080
Kind of cool.

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:04.080
I'm sure there's something you could rig up to to hold the machine, the little thing, safely in a vertical position.

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:07.080
And then you could use a pro controller or something.

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.080
It's still neat to have the option.

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:11.080
Yeah, it's neat to have the option.

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:14.080
If you play with the controller thing in the bottom, it works really well.

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:17.080
I really like playing pinball FX that way.

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:23.080
Alright, and then there's this cool game called Duck Jam, which is on itch.io.

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:29.080
And it's a free WarioWare type game featuring ducks.

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:34.080
And it definitely takes a lot of inspiration from different Nintendo games.

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:38.080
Because they've got an overworld map that looks like it's out of Super Mario World.

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:44.080
And I know there's some other things in there that very much look like WarioWare.

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.080
But go check it out.

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:48.080
You'll find it at...

01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:51.080
Looks like Boon.itch.io.

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:59.080
So that's Boon with B-O-O-O-N dot itch dot I-O slash duck dash jam.

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.080
And you can check it out.

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:02.080
And it's pretty awesome.

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.080
They've got a bunch of little mini games that increasingly get harder.

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.080
And all sorts of silly stuff in there.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:10.080
So they have one where a duck's eating a piece of bread.

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:12.080
They have one that's like Flappy Bird.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.080
They have one that's a dating sim.

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.080
So just go check it out. It looks silly and it's free.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.080
And check out Super Multitasking.

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:22.080
Even though you have to pay for that one, you know what? It's worth it.

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:27.080
So I know the launch glow has died down a little bit.

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:30.080
And so it's probably having a hard time getting some more exposure.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:33.080
So let me remind you, if you haven't picked up Super Multitasking on Steam,

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:35.080
our buddy YYR did a great job.

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:38.080
If you like these WarioWare type of games, do it.

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:41.080
Anyhow, I have some stories for you guys as well.

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:44.080
We're going to start with a story about the Mega Man X Collection.

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:45.080
Who's excited about this?

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:48.080
There's Mega Man X Legacy 1 and 2.

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:51.080
It is coming to the Nintendo Switch on July 24th.

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:54.080
Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 and 2.

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.080
America and Europe on July 24th.

01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:57.080
You know the only thing about these games?

01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:00.080
I feel like nowadays I'm not very good to play with them.

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:03.080
It's almost like one of these games it'd be like I'd rent it

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:07.080
and then I would use the Game Genie to kind of cheese my way through it.

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:10.080
Here's your chance to do it without cheating.

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.080
I do want to state before someone corrects me,

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:15.080
it is also on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but come on.

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:18.080
I know I'm getting it on the Switch so I can have the, you know,

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:20.080
this isn't a game that needs the most amped up systems

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:23.080
so it'd be nice to have it portable and on the TV.

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.080
So that's pretty cool.

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.080
But they are, I guess they are separate games.

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:30.080
So they're 1 and 2, but I think the disc release is probably the combo.

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:33.080
But if you buy the thing online, you buy them piecemeal.

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:37.080
But if you're wondering, just so you know,

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:44.080
the Mega Man X3 in the collection is the Super Nintendo version of the game.

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:47.080
So it is not the PlayStation version.

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:51.080
Yeah, but even the versions that came out on PlayStation and Saturn

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:55.080
were just the Super Nintendo ones anyway with a big frame around it,

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:56.080
so it doesn't matter.

01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.080
Yeah, so just to be clear what you're buying,

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.080
you're getting the Super Nintendo version.

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:03.080
Also, these were developed internally at Capcom,

01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:07.080
not through Digital Eclipse who did the previous collections.

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:10.080
I guess Capcom saw that these things were selling pretty well

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:13.080
and wanted to bring that in house, so there you go.

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:17.080
Also, Warcraft 3 is getting a patch.

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:19.080
That's right, Warcraft 3.

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:20.080
Another one?

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.080
Yeah.

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.080
I did a story on this a few months ago.

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.080
Well, here's the thing.

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:26.080
When you did the story, it was that the patch was being developed.

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:28.080
Now the patch is out.

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:31.080
So this is the biggest patch that the game has gotten in a long time.

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.080
It's version 1.29.

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:36.080
They are saying this is the biggest patch in over 10 years.

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.080
You know one thing it includes?

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:42.080
You know what you have in Warcraft 3 now that you didn't have before?

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:46.080
Widescreen monitor support is now in Warcraft 3.

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.080
It's about time.

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.080
But that's awesome.

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:52.080
I mean, the fact that this game is so old, but now it's kind of modernized.

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:56.080
Widescreen monitors are commonplace now, so that's really cool.

01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.080
So there is no stretching.

01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:02.080
There are bookends in the in-game interface and black pillars in the menus.

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:05.080
So that way I guess you don't lose, you know.

01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:07.080
It's not all stretchy and weird things like that.

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:10.080
Also in lobbies, 24 players now.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:14.080
12 new team colors, including Maroon, Navy, Turquoise, and others.

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:16.080
A reset in ladder standings.

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.080
Automated tournaments will resume next week.

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:22.080
This will be the last version to support Windows XP.

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:23.080
Sniff.

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:26.080
My fave, y'all.

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.080
My fave.

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.080
The map pool has been updated.

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:34.080
This means there is an object limit increase up to 30,000,

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:38.080
and a map size limit at 480 by 480, and a tile slot limit at 16.

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:41.080
So assuming with the beefier computers we have these days,

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:42.080
now they can do some better maps.

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:46.080
Some folks thinking this is leading to a potential Warcraft remaster,

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:49.080
just like we had the Starcraft remaster.

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:50.080
Who knows?

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.080
I think that would be really awesome, actually.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:53.080
I might even check that out.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.080
I don't...

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:56.080
Gaming's a shocking secret.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:58.080
I don't own Warcraft 3, and I never have.

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:02.080
I own Warcraft 1 and 2, and I own World of Warcraft,

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.080
but Warcraft 3 kind of came out during a time

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:06.080
when I wasn't really playing as many games.

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:08.080
Or if I was playing games, I was probably playing Diablo.

01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:10.080
If I was playing anything Blizzard, I was probably playing that.

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:12.080
Diablo or Diablo 2.

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.080
Never got around to that.

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:17.080
Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:22.080
Well, an announcement was made that Shenmue 1 and 2

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:27.080
is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC through Steam.

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:31.080
They announced it at SEGA Fest 2018,

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:36.080
and it looks like it's going to be released for $29.99.

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:39.080
But in Japan, it's only going to be on PlayStation 4.

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.080
So, yay.

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:44.080
When's Shenmue 3 again?

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:51.080
And then last but not least, they announced a new Sakura Taisen or Sakura Wars.

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:55.080
They don't say what it's going to be on,

01:36:55.080 --> 01:37:03.080
but it will be set in Taisho-era Tokyo around 1929.

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:10.080
And this is the last time I think a Sakura Taisen game came out.

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:19.080
It was in 2010, but that was a re-release of the 2005 Sakura Taisen,

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.080
so long, my love.

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:22.080
So, yay.

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:24.080
Another Sakura Taisen.

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:25.080
What will it be on?

01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:27.080
We don't know.

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:29.080
All the systems.

01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:30.080
All right.

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.080
Fifth Dream in chat says,

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:34.080
I've been waiting for this news ever since Shenmue 3 was announced.

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:37.080
I've never played 2, and I want to play them both before 3.

01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:40.080
So, this will be a good way to get caught up for a lot of people.

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.080
I think I'm going to check it out.

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:42.080
That's for sure.

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:44.080
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates,

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:47.080
and then we'll get to the mailbag right after that.

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:49.080
But first, in the U.S., Loki.

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.080
We've got Ys VIII.

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.080
It looks like a Lacrimosa of Dona.

01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.080
Another freaking Ys game.

01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:57.080
Yes, that's on PC.

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:58.080
Ys.

01:37:58.080 --> 01:37:59.080
Ys.

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:00.080
Ys.

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:02.080
Wild Guns Reloaded on Nintendo Switch.

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:04.080
At least I didn't say Ys.

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.080
I would have had to throw my phone at you.

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:10.080
Yakuza 6, The Song of Life on PlayStation 4.

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:15.080
Metal Max Xeno on PlayStation 4 and the Vita.

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:18.080
God of War on PlayStation 4 this week.

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.080
And then, of course, if you have a Switch and you're feeling a little crafty,

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:26.080
Nintendo Labo, the variety kit and the robot kit are out this week as well.

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:29.080
And I believe that's it.

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:32.080
You know, we haven't talked a lot about God of War this week,

01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:36.080
but I know the reviews for that have been very, very good,

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:37.080
and people are really excited.

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:39.080
So, it's coming out this next week.

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:40.080
It didn't come out.

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.080
I thought it came out last week.

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:42.080
No, it's coming out this week.

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:44.080
Okay, so it must have been just all the press came out this last week,

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.080
so they knew they had a good game on their hands.

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:49.080
So, I have to admit, though, I'm not super into the God of War series.

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:50.080
I never have been.

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:52.080
So, I don't know if this is something that screams at me.

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:55.080
I was interested in the older God of War games.

01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:57.080
This one, I don't really, nah.

01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:00.080
It was interesting, though, one of the reviews I was glancing at on it

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:04.080
said something interesting about how the violence has been,

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:06.080
like, it's not that the game's not violent,

01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:12.080
but that maybe now we're looking at the ramifications of all that violence

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.080
kind of plays out in this game.

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.080
I find that very fascinating,

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.080
very kind of like self-referential sort of thing for the series,

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:20.080
you know what I mean?

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:23.080
So, I'm looking forward to seeing how that plays out.

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.080
All right, let's go over to Japan

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:26.080
and check out what's coming out over there,

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.080
including Metal Max Xeno is also out in a regular limited edition

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.080
on PlayStation 4 in Japan this week.

01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.080
Gravel is also out there as well,

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:38.080
and a price reduction, if you want, on Digimon World Next Order.

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:40.080
So, maybe Dark Soccer wants to import that. I don't know.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:41.080
No.

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:45.080
Man Shima TT Race Ride on the Edge is also out this week,

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:48.080
and God of War also out on Japan on the 20th,

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.080
the same day it is out apparently everywhere else.

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:51.080
There it is.

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:54.080
Let's see, also on the Vita, that Metal Max Xeno

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:56.080
also getting released on the Vita

01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:59.080
because the Vita still gets a lot of games in Japan.

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:00.080
And then on the Switch this week,

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:03.080
that Nintendo Labo also making its way to Japan.

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:06.080
Same kits we have here, the variety kit and the robot kit.

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:10.080
There is no extra stuff that Japan's getting that we're not.

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.080
But, Japan is also getting a game this week on the Switch.

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:16.080
Portal Knights and Wonder Boy the Dragon's Trap

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:19.080
is getting its Japanese release this week,

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.080
which, you know, that was a game we've had for a little bit now

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:24.080
where you can switch between the, speaking of Sega stuff,

01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:26.080
you can switch between the regular and normal,

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.080
or the retro and the remastered modes with a button press.

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:31.080
It's pretty cool.

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:34.080
So, that will be fun to play for the Japanese audience

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:35.080
who hasn't seen that yet.

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:36.080
So, cool.

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:38.080
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:40.080
There are a few things.

01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:44.080
Coming out on the 17th, we have Yakuza 6, the Song of Life.

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:49.080
God, stop asking me to send notifications.

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.080
Fine.

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:52.080
Sorry, it was harassing me.

01:40:52.080 --> 01:41:00.080
We have the PS4 Pro 1TB God of War limited edition console on the 20th.

01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:05.080
And then, of course, God of War, again, on the 20th

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:09.080
with all kinds of figurines and stuff, too.

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:13.080
Assetto Corsa Ultimate Edition on April 20th as well.

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:15.080
Don't Starve Megapack.

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:18.080
And that's it.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:21.080
All right, we're going to get here to the emails.

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:23.080
Sorry for the distraction here in studio,

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:27.080
but JD is using Snapchat to send me snaps of the drag show he's at.

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.080
And so, there was just, I think that was Erica Clash

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:33.080
that was dancing on stage in a big butterfly outfit, too.

01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:34.080
Dynamite rave?

01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.080
Yeah, no, to a rock version of butterfly.

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:37.080
So, I'm living.

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.080
Oh, my God, I should have went.

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:40.080
I can't believe I didn't go to that.

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:42.080
Anyway, but I'm here with you guys.

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:44.080
You don't want to know what else I was doing.

01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:46.080
I'm planning on Disneybounding.

01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:47.080
Oh, for your trip?

01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:52.080
And I'm looking, I found a tank top that looks like a Tron outfit.

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.080
Love it.

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:56.080
But it's got the lines, so I was going to do...

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:59.080
Quick story, because listeners may not know what Disney, Disneybonding?

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:00.080
Bound.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.080
Disneybounding.

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:02.080
I don't know what Disneybonding is.

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.080
It's casual cosplay.

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:07.080
Yeah, it's like, because you can't wear costumes into the park unless you're a kid.

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:10.080
It's an outfit inspired by a Disney character or franchise.

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:14.080
So, you wear like a normal outfit, but that looks kind of,

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:16.080
like I saw one for Gaston.

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:18.080
That was when you were there with me.

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:21.080
The girl that was doing the Gaston tunic.

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:22.080
Yes.

01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:23.080
Yeah, I've seen that, too.

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:28.080
Victoria posted hers the other day with the bell off the shoulder yellow outfit.

01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:31.080
So that's a thing that people do now, is they wear outfits that kind of...

01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:35.080
One of my favorites was a guy wearing a pinstripe black and green suit,

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:38.080
three piece suit, in front of the Haunted Mansion.

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.080
Nice.

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.080
Yep.

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.080
Alright.

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.080
Let's get to the mailbag.

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.080
Every week you guys send us emails.

01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:46.080
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com.

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:49.080
You know when the chat room's busted, email still works.

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:53.080
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.080
Last week we had a dry well in the email bag,

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.080
but I think tonight our fortune has changed a little bit, right?

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:02.080
Dark Soccer's going to dive into the mailbag and find some emails to read for you.

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.080
We have a couple.

01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:04.080
Alright.

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.080
Alright.

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:06.080
Um...

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:07.080
God, long emails.

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.080
Okay.

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:12.080
Um, hello peoples, let us discuss something that is a frequent topic on the show,

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:14.080
food and the ruining of it.

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:16.080
Oh, Rob, you're going to like this one.

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.080
Okay.

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.080
Because you brought it up.

01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:22.080
This weekend, Heinz announced that they would be putting into the market mayochup.

01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:23.080
Next email.

01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.080
A combination of mayonnaise and ketchup.

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:27.080
The reaction to this was wide and almost nearly negative,

01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:31.080
including I've never been inspired to cyberbully a condiment company before,

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:35.080
but here we are at HeinzKetchup underscore US delete your account.

01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:36.080
Sky.

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:38.080
Did somebody just email me my own tweet?

01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:39.080
Yes.

01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:41.080
Also another one for you.

01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:42.080
Why would you ruin ketchup like this?

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.080
Also, Sky.

01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:46.080
Yeah, that guy's smart.

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.080
Listen to him.

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:49.080
Why would you ruin ketchup like this?

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:51.080
Whose bright idea was this?

01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:55.080
Like with many things, the people responsible for this travesty is the Mormons.

01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:57.080
And it's talking about fry sauce.

01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.080
Can we blame millennials for this?

01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:00.080
It's millennials' fault.

01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:02.080
Fry sauce is big in Utah.

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:03.080
I grew up on fry sauce.

01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:04.080
I love fry sauce.

01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:06.080
I expect to have fry sauce with lunch today.

01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:07.080
Fry sauce exists.

01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:10.080
It doesn't have a stupid jumbled up smoosh of a name.

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.080
It's called fry sauce.

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:12.080
You can buy it.

01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:13.080
It exists.

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:14.080
This is already a thing.

01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:15.080
Stay black, great entertainment.

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.080
Fry sauce in the South is much different.

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.080
So, just saying.

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:23.080
Is this like how iced tea in the South is different than everywhere else?

01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:24.080
Oh my God.

01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:28.080
So, one of my friends posted the best thing about iced tea and I have to find it because

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:32.080
this is the perfect thing.

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:33.080
And it's got to be real.

01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:36.080
I actually sent it to my mother because it was so perfect and I don't normally send things

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:39.080
with cussing in it to my mother.

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:44.080
But this is absolute perfection in the form of a post and it's very recent and I'm going

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:49.080
to find it real quick because everyone needs to hear this because this is how I feel.

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:50.080
I'm torn.

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:51.080
Okay.

01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:54.080
You know, I'm just going to pull up out of my message to my mother.

01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:55.080
No, seriously.

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:56.080
It is that newsworthy.

01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:57.080
Okay.

01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:59.080
I'm just kind of like, all right.

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:03.080
The show is at a screeching halt right now to our Sakura because I got nothing until

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:04.080
we get to the next detail.

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:05.080
Okay.

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:06.080
All right.

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:09.080
I hate when I go up North and go to restaurants and the waiter comes to take my order and

01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:10.080
I'm like, do y'all have sweet tea?

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:13.080
And they're like, no sweet sweetheart, but we have unsweetened iced tea.

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:17.080
We can give you some sugar packets like no you fucking Yankee because now the tea is

01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:21.080
already cold so the sugar won't dissolve in it and it'll just sink to the bottom.

01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:22.080
Be nasty.

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:23.080
Learn basic fucking solubility.

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:24.080
This is ninth grade chemistry.

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.080
That's why sweet tea exists in the first place.

01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:30.080
You fucking heat the tea up and make it and then while it's still hot, you add the sugar

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:32.080
and then you chill it and it's sweet fucking tea.

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.080
I bet you pronounce pecan like pecan too.

01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:39.080
So you four seasons having piece of shit.

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:41.080
And now you know how all of us in the South feel about it.

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.080
I'm almost positive.

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:44.080
I brought this up just a couple of weeks ago on the show, but the thing with sweet tea

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:47.080
is that when you order it here in California, you go, do you have sweet tea?

01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:49.080
They'll be like, Oh yeah, we have the raspberry tea.

01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:54.080
Mm hmm.

01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:55.080
That is what they do.

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:56.080
Jamie, you know this.

01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:00.080
If you were to go to like Denny's and ask for sweet tea, they'd be like, we have the

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:01.080
raspberry.

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:02.080
Yeah.

01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:03.080
I'd be like, that is sweet tea here.

01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:04.080
You know what you can have?

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:08.080
You can have a stick up your ass cause I'm going to shove it there and have a grand slam

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:09.080
witch.

01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:15.080
You can have moons over Miami next email.

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:18.080
I remember when I went in and ordered a moons over my Turkey.

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:22.080
I think they have like, I think right now they have like the whole Han Solo themed crap

01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:23.080
at Denny's.

01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:26.080
And I have, I really try to avoid setting foot in at Denny's.

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:30.080
So I was driving back and forth myself to the Bay area yesterday.

01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:31.080
So it was kind of a lonely drive.

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:35.080
Well, no, cause my friend John was nothing for part of it, but then he went to a soccer

01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:36.080
game.

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.080
So, but going home, I was hungry.

01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:40.080
So I was like, God, what's going to be open at 10 o'clock at night?

01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:42.080
And I'm like, Oh my God, I'm gonna have to go to a Denny's.

01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:43.080
So I just want to take a minute.

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:44.080
Bless you back.

01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:49.080
Black bear diner for being available as an alternative and getting food that wasn't Denny's

01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:50.080
food.

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:51.080
And that's all I have to say.

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:52.080
Well, I don't know.

01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:54.080
Sweet tea almost gave me the diabetes.

01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:57.080
Well, my favorite sweet tea story is Alan.

01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:01.080
When we first got to Georgia, we went to that little diner and he was like, Oh man, I'm

01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:02.080
so dehydrated from all that flying.

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:06.080
He drank like four sweet teas and he's like, why am I up till three in the morning?

01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:12.080
I wonder why my granny used to make sweet tea and she would infuse saccharin in it at

01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:16.080
the same time as all the sugar that she put in it while it was steeping.

01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:22.080
It was strong as fuck and that is sweet tea and the kids were not allowed to have it after

01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.080
eight o'clock.

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:24.080
All right.

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:25.080
Next email.

01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:26.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:30.080
You know, why am I the only one who ever deletes things out of the email box, Rob?

01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:33.080
Cause you're the email person.

01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:34.080
Mm hmm.

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.080
But when I'm not here, you don't delete anything.

01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:37.080
Oh yeah, I sure don't.

01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:39.080
Hi all, it's Raginator once again.

01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:42.080
I just thought that I would pose a seemingly random question to everyone.

01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:45.080
By now, most of us have been gamers for quite some time.

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.080
Not me.

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:47.080
I'm kidding.

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:48.080
Decades really.

01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:52.080
With the only real differences being the platforms that we choose to play on as well as the genre

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:53.080
we enjoy.

01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:57.080
We've played miscellaneous platforms and games over the years when they were brand new.

01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:03.080
We've read various gaming magazines religiously for news tips, tricks, reviews, et cetera.

01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:05.080
We've seen, not we've saw.

01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:10.080
We have seen TV commercials galore and we've even engrossed ourselves in gaming related

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:15.080
media, TV shows and cartoons, movies, books, toys, collectibles, even cereal.

01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:18.080
I never ate the video game cereals cause they were gross.

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:19.080
I did.

01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:20.080
Just saying.

01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:21.080
I hate marshmallows.

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:22.080
I don't like the switch cereal.

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:25.080
It tastes like switch cartridges.

01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:31.080
Gaming culture, as we've each individually experienced, it really nestles in nicely with

01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:34.080
the overall culture and has shaped us to become who we are today.

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:40.080
That being said, do each of you have a favorite 10 year, I was trying to say period in history

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.080
at the same time and it's coming up, history.

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:47.080
10 year period in as far as a gaming slash gaming culture slash gaming history.

01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:50.080
For the purposes of this question, the answers don't have to conform to decades, i.e. the

01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:52.080
80s, the 90s, et cetera.

01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:54.080
Please give a reason for your answer.

01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:57.080
Do I have to show my work?

01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:58.080
Jesus.

01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:02.080
I will go though for pretty much my teenage years as a gamer because that was the advent

01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:04.080
of the Super Nintendo.

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:15.080
I would even say from the advent of the Super Nintendo through the life of the Saturn because

01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:21.080
I was old enough to be able to save my own money and buy what I wanted and I, you know,

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:28.080
I stole my brother's Super Nintendo because they were little and I was the bigger sibling.

01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:30.080
So I played a lot of Super Nintendo, just a ton.

01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:36.080
I mean I also played a lot of NES but I really feel like my massive enjoyment and formative

01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:42.080
years are really I guess where I put more skill into it was when I hit my teenage years.

01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:51.080
And then I spent like, you know, my 20s going into, you know, the Dreamcast came out when

01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:54.080
I was in my 20s, 1999.

01:49:54.080 --> 01:50:03.080
So I just think that whole realm from maybe about 13 through 30, so not necessarily a

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:08.080
10-year period but that just period of time, it really seemed like the golden age of really

01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.080
good games.

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:14.080
You know, even though my gut wants to say, oh, go for the retro answer because nothing

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.080
will ever be as good as the Super Nintendo when it was first out and, you know, those

01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:21.080
years and everything, my honest answer, like honestly, and the thing that I'm just like,

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:25.080
no, this is what my heart says is the right answer is Memorial Day 2000 and the 10 years

01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:29.080
that followed because that was the first time I ever saw DDR.

01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:33.080
And then, you know, I got to play DDR the first time at the Rocky Horror Convention

01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:38.080
that Halloween, which is the 25th anniversary collection or collection, 25th anniversary

01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:40.080
gaming podcasting.

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:45.080
But my point is without that, I would not have met the people in this room.

01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:48.080
I wouldn't have the show that y'all are listening to right now.

01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:54.080
Like that was like the culture that formulated that now that I'm like pushing 40 and like

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:58.080
what's come the 16 years before it, you know, especially the heyday of the DDR years.

01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:02.080
And obviously, I think a 10-year period is good because it takes us up through about

01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:07.080
the time when Konami kind of started, you know, declining and so forth and started

01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:12.080
closing, you know, Hawaii and the San Francisco Bay Area studio and kind of turned

01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:15.080
into the, you know, not so great thing that it is now.

01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:17.080
So, yeah, that's my answer.

01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:20.080
Memorial Day 2000 and the 10 years that followed.

01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:22.080
I almost agreed with that.

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:27.080
But I started with like the BM 98 stuff in the 90s.

01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:29.080
So that was your first exposure to it.

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:30.080
That was mine.

01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:35.080
But that 10-year period, though, is a pretty good gap of gaming history.

01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:40.080
But I think that I wouldn't have been as into it if I hadn't had the same formation

01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:44.080
with all of like the Saturn and import gaming, because I started import gaming before I moved

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:45.080
out here.

01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:47.080
So, um, sorry.

01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:48.080
Really quick.

01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:49.080
Then we'll get to look at us.

01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:50.080
Joe and her.

01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:51.080
Matt is asking a chat.

01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:54.080
Was that the same trip where you called Travis drunk Rob with the infamous voicemail that

01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:56.080
I never lived down on under station life?

01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:00.080
Yes, it was because I was with Jessica Harper and some other folks.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:03.080
Actually, I think Princess Irene was there, too.

01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:05.080
We were all there because we were all in the same Rocky cast.

01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:08.080
And so we were all this and we were all the Star Trek experience.

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:10.080
So it was like I miss the Star Trek experience.

01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:11.080
I swear.

01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:14.080
Like, I think like Saturday we went to the Rocky thing.

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:18.080
And what's funny is that the video was circulating on Facebook this week of Eric McCormick as

01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:22.080
frankenfurter singing karaoke to a sweet transvestite.

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:24.080
We were Jessica, myself, Prince Irene.

01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:26.080
We were all in the audience for that.

01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:28.080
I was there live and it's like watching it now.

01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:31.080
I'm like, is this video from the 70s?

01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:34.080
I'm like, it looks so grainy, but I'm like, nope.

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.080
It's just worn down over the years.

01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:36.080
But we were there at Vegas.

01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:37.080
The heart.

01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:41.080
It was the Hard Rock Hotel, which I just heard this week is going to no longer.

01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:43.080
There are no longer going to be Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas.

01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:45.080
It's going to be the Virgin Hotel.

01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:46.080
I remember.

01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:47.080
Now, this is years after that.

01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:50.080
But Jessica and I were there for DDR freak trip.

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:51.080
Yeah.

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:52.080
You guys did your random.

01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:53.080
I was never.

01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:56.080
And we called Travis and left him a drunk voicemail in honor of you.

01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:57.080
Yes.

01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:58.080
Yes.

01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:00.080
And Tiara met us for the Star Trek experience.

01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:01.080
Yeah.

01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:02.080
So that was pretty fun.

01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:03.080
I miss Star Trek experience.

01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:04.080
You all don't even know.

01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:05.080
I mean, that thing's been gone for years.

01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:09.080
I just liked hanging out in quarks because I really did feel like I was on DS9 for a

01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:10.080
moment.

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:11.080
It was very well done.

01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:12.080
And hanging out with Klingons.

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:15.080
That whole ride and everything was very well done.

01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:16.080
It was beautiful.

01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:18.080
Um, you can sort of see it.

01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:24.080
It is on the, um, I have the Blu-ray collection of all the next generation movies.

01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:28.080
I bought it when I had swine flu and I was homebound for a week.

01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:30.080
There is on the extras.

01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:31.080
I gave you swine flu.

01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:32.080
You did.

01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:33.080
Not on purpose.

01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:38.080
On the extras disc in there, there is a decommissioning of the Star Trek experience.

01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:43.080
Um, and I actually got a little verklempt watching it, but you actually, it takes you

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:45.080
through both rides.

01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:48.080
So somebody filmed it in Blu-ray quality, like you're going through both rides.

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:51.080
So that's the closest thing you can get now because I never did get to do the Borg thing.

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.080
So that was the only way I was able to do the Borg thing.

01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:53.080
I didn't do that one either.

01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:55.080
I did the, um, the Klingon.

01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:56.080
Yeah, the original.

01:53:56.080 --> 01:54:00.080
The original, but you could, so you can cut, but nothing compares to being there, especially

01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:03.080
the tran, the transporter thing is such a great effect.

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:06.080
It was just awesome being on the bridge for a bit.

01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:07.080
For sure.

01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:08.080
For sure.

01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:09.080
Anyway, nerd, nerd, nerd.

01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:11.080
How about the email answer for you, Loki?

01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:15.080
Uh, the 10 years of gaming that you liked the most, that defines you the most.

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:17.080
What was the criteria?

01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:22.080
Um, I guess it would be what, do you have a favorite period?

01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:23.080
Okay.

01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:24.080
So yeah.

01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:25.080
No, I don't.

01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:26.080
I don't know.

01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:27.080
I can't think of anything.

01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:30.080
I mean, yeah, DDR was fun.

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:34.080
I say the next 20, next 10 years would be fun.

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:37.080
Uh, a hopeful answer.

01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:38.080
It's the next 10 years.

01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:39.080
Yeah.

01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:42.080
Cause I can imagine with, you know, like how fast VR tech is going.

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:43.080
Okay.

01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:45.080
All the hope has been killed in my heart.

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:49.080
I like, I like, that's a very hopeful, positive answer from Loki.

01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:52.080
And I will be sorely disappointed, but that's all right.

01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:57.080
Are you saying that the Nintendo, everything since the launch of the Nintendo Switch is

01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:58.080
your answer?

01:54:58.080 --> 01:54:59.080
Oh no.

01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:02.080
They're in their own little country where they're doing their own shit about, you know,

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:06.080
not, not really listening to the consumer as far as what we want.

01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:10.080
Nintendo Switch is virtual console or, you know, Animal Crossing with virtual console

01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:11.080
games.

01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:13.080
You're looking forward for Ready Player One to be real.

01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:14.080
Yes, please.

01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:15.080
All right.

01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:16.080
That's what it is.

01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:19.080
There's more to the email cause Reginator of course gave us his answer.

01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:20.080
Of course.

01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:23.080
For me, my favorite period was from 87 to 97.

01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:25.080
Reasons are several fold really.

01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:29.080
NES was really becoming popular in 87 and I had received the deluxe set for Christmas

01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:30.080
that year.

01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:34.080
We saw the beginnings of gaming becoming mainstream with movies and TV shows like Super Mario

01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:39.080
Brothers movie, Double Dragon, Super Mario Super Show, Captain N, and countless others.

01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:44.080
We transitioned from 8-bit generation to the 16-bit generation and saw the whole Sega vs.

01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:46.080
Nintendo console war take off.

01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:50.080
There was the multimedia boom of the early nineties where PCs and consoles that could

01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:53.080
use CDs and thus full motion video became big.

01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:57.080
There were also a plethora of consoles and handhelds released at this time, most of which

01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:00.080
flopped in the end of some made impact.

01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:04.080
Our kids were revitalized with the surge of fighting games like Street Fighter II and

01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:05.080
Mortal Kombat.

01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:07.080
He wrote Kombat, not Kombat.

01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:11.080
Is it like a, like where you do a betting pool against who's going to win the Mortal

01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:12.080
Kombat?

01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:13.080
That would be, uh...

01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:14.080
Mortal Kombat.

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:15.080
What is that called?

01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:16.080
I can't remember.

01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:17.080
It's, uh...

01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:18.080
Blood support.

01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:19.080
Salt.

01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:21.080
I can't remember what they call that.

01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:23.080
There is a Twitch thing.

01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:24.080
Salty bet.

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:25.080
Okay.

01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:29.080
Some political opportunist tasted blood in the water and started attacking gaming.

01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:32.080
I could go on and on, but this email is already getting too long.

01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:36.080
This email was brought to you by Old Potatoes.

01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:37.080
How old?

01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:38.080
I don't know.

01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:41.080
Like so old that they started growing vines out of them?

01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:43.080
But he did the pfft at the end.

01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:46.080
So, which is what the colon P is.

01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:47.080
Right.

01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:48.080
All right.

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:49.080
Is that it for emails?

01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:50.080
Stephanie.

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:54.080
Participate at orangelandrater.com if you'd like to email us for a future episode and

01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:56.080
ask us a question like that one.

01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:57.080
That was a pretty good question.

01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:59.080
We have some good answers there.

01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:02.080
We have some more news stories before we get to a few calls tonight.

01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:06.080
I do have to, because I do have the movie after the show, I do have to end the show

01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:07.080
right at a certain time tonight.

01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:09.080
So sorry, but also not sorry.

01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:12.080
So first we have some news to get to.

01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:17.080
So Valve has updated their privacy options.

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:25.080
Basically, they're allowing Steam users to choose how their, you know, I guess their

01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:27.080
activities are being viewed.

01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:30.080
So, by default, everything is hidden.

01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:34.080
So your library and other data like that.

01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:41.080
Unfortunately, along with that, because it relied on those public, the public libraries

01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:47.080
being scraped and everything, Steam Spy, which is basically a service that kind of helped

01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:54.080
calculate, you know, game sales as well as how much a game is being played and that type

01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:55.080
of stuff.

01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:58.080
Almost like wages to be able to chart sales and everything.

01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:08.080
It is now broken because everybody's profile is now set to hidden by default.

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:11.080
That's unfortunate.

01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:13.080
And unfortunately, there's not really anything they can do.

01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:18.080
So until everything's visible by default, there's not going to be able to operate

01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:19.080
Steam Spy anymore.

01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:21.080
I wonder why Steam decided to make this change.

01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:25.080
Were they specifically just trying to get at Steam Spy or is it just maybe it's because

01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:28.080
of all the privacy stuff going on?

01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:31.080
I mean, even though I know Facebook and Steam really have nothing to do with each other,

01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:35.080
besides the fact that you can link the two, everything that Facebook's going through

01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:37.080
right now with all their bullshit.

01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:42.080
Like maybe Steam is like, maybe we should need to turn like high privacy on by default.

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:44.080
I'm not really sure what the reason was behind it.

01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:47.080
I don't think it was in on purpose to destroy Steam Spy.

01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:49.080
I think it was probably other things they were doing.

01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:53.080
It's probably everything else going on in the world regarding privacy on the internet

01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:57.080
where they were like, you know what, we need to, we need to err on the caution of privacy

01:58:57.080 --> 01:59:01.080
and things being private and friends only is the default option, which is really the

01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:06.080
Yeah, it was really the way things ought to be, but you don't make money that way,

01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:07.080
I suppose.

01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:08.080
All right.

01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:11.080
Well, the BAFTAs happened this past week.

01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:13.080
That is the, uh, what does BAFTAs stand for?

01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:15.080
British Academy Film and Television Arts.

01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:16.080
That's what it stands for.

01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:23.080
The 14th Annual Game Awards were held this past week and, uh, some winners from this

01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:29.080
a best performance, uh, Malina Jergens, who is in Hellblade, uh, Suna's Sacrifice, which

01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:31.080
she was winning that award a lot of places.

01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:34.080
So, not too, uh, uh, shocked to hear that.

01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:37.080
Best Original Property, Horizon Zero Dawn.

01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:39.080
Best Narrative, Night in the Woods.

01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:41.080
Best Music, Cuphead.

01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:42.080
That's a good choice.

01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:45.080
Uh, Best Multiplayer, Divinity Original Sin 2.

01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:48.080
Best Mobile, Golf Clash.

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:52.080
Best Game Innova- Innova- Innovation, The Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild.

01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:55.080
Best Game Design, Super Mario Odyssey.

01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:59.080
Gamed Beyond Entertainment, Hellblade Suna's Sacrifice.

01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:01.080
Best Family Game, Mario Odyssey.

02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:03.080
Best Evolving Game, Overwatch.

02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:07.080
Best Debut Game, Gorogora- Gorogoa, excuse me.

02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:10.080
Uh, Hellblade also got the British Game and Audio Achievement.

02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.080
Best British Game.

02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:13.080
Artistic Achievement, also Hellblade.

02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:17.080
But then the Best Game, something that didn't win an award anywhere else.

02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:20.080
The Best Game, the Game of the Year.

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:24.080
What Remains of Edith Finch was the game that they gave Game of the Year to at the BAFTAs.

02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:28.080
Now, I get it because I thought Edith Finch was amazing.

02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:31.080
And if you haven't played that game, I think it's a great story.

02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:34.080
And it's not going to take you a super long time to get through it.

02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:36.080
It's a few hours, about the length of a long movie.

02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:39.080
Um, but I thought that was a great gaming experience.

02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:45.080
And, you know, but then again, I know some people have strong opinions on walking simulators.

02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:53.080
Now, granted, um, Edith Finch has some more interactive, kind of mini-game-esque sort of things.

02:00:53.080 --> 02:01:00.080
That, like, unlike Gone Home, which really didn't have a lot of, you know, gamey elements in it.

02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:05.080
It was more of like a, you know, a story that you played, you participated in.

02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:08.080
Um, which I still love. That's not a slam on Gone Home. I love Gone Home.

02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:11.080
I do think Edith Finch had a couple more, at least, gamey elements in it.

02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:13.080
So, it might satisfy some of those people.

02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:16.080
I love those games. Like, I think as long as the story is great.

02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:19.080
You all know I fucking love Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.

02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:21.080
I think that game is magnificent.

02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:22.080
I streamed that.

02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:25.080
It gets shit on unnecessarily all the time.

02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:28.080
I think Firewatch is fucking great, too.

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:31.080
I think it's cool that that game is finally coming out on the Switch.

02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:35.080
But I'm also kind of like, well, it's been out for forever. You should have played it by now.

02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:37.080
But I guess Nintendo does have a separate audience.

02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:42.080
So, I mean, those games, all of them I think are great and worth your time.

02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:45.080
Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:52.080
I have, it's kind of just a little, what's the word I'm thinking of, like a personal touch kind of story.

02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:53.080
Sure.

02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:56.080
And it's something that just made me feel really happy to see.

02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:08.080
Because, um, there is a Welsh craft that is creating these balls that you sew into these different patterns.

02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:17.080
And I may not have brought this up, but my family's ancestry is Welsh, a good number of it.

02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:23.080
But there is a lady named Karen Royer who is a grandmother who loves to play video games.

02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:26.080
Especially taken with Assassin's Creed.

02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:31.080
Her name online is the Assassin.

02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:38.080
And she, I'm sorry, I was actually using the wrong one.

02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:42.080
It's the Ukrainian egg art, not the Welsh balls. Although the Welsh balls are also neat.

02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:50.080
But she and her family had different interests.

02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:52.080
But she wanted to do egg kits.

02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:55.080
And she had gotten interested in doing that.

02:02:55.080 --> 02:03:00.080
They're basically, they're called, I'm going to mispronounce it, Pisanki.

02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:04.080
Where you poke holes in a raw egg to drain the eggs.

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:06.080
And you blow out the egg white and the yolks.

02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:10.080
And then you cover them with layers of colored wax.

02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:15.080
And then you use a candle to melt designs over the wax.

02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:24.080
And so what she's wanting to do is work with professors at, I need to find what WPI stands for.

02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:28.080
I think it's one of the local schools. Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:37.080
To create a game that uses basically mathematical patterns.

02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:44.080
So they're using computer science and computer learning to try to make those eggs in a virtual environment.

02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:50.080
And so they are working on it as a project to turn it into a full-fledged game.

02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:52.080
I think that's kind of neat.

02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:55.080
When you take two things that you love and marry them together.

02:03:55.080 --> 02:04:03.080
But on top of that, when you're learning something, basically a mathematical process in a virtual environment.

02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:06.080
Finding something that you love makes it live a lot better.

02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:08.080
And I just think it's kind of cool.

02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:14.080
I'd like to see more traditional crafts have a way to live through video games.

02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:17.080
So I just thought it would be a neat interesting story.

02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:20.080
And she actually made a game, Loki.

02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:24.080
She was being graded for it.

02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:26.080
I had to.

02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:31.080
And then she's really working in the calculation.

02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:35.080
But then she's also working on bringing in a new one which is lace eggs.

02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:39.080
Where you use a drill to make lace like cuts in the eggs.

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:41.080
That's cool.

02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:43.080
So it's like a crafty sort of game.

02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:46.080
I've seen people use exacto knives to do patterns in eggs.

02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:49.080
So there's actually back in the day.

02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:51.080
Now this is getting a little bit into history.

02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:55.080
But in the Victorian era, it was a popular Easter egg thing.

02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:57.080
That you would blow out the eggs like that.

02:04:57.080 --> 02:05:00.080
And use a little bit of wax to seal the bottom of the egg.

02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:03.080
And make chocolate marbled eggs that way.

02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:05.080
And you let them harden in the shell.

02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:09.080
Then they open the shell and there's chocolate inside instead of egg.

02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:12.080
So I think it's just.

02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:14.080
Is that where Cadbury eggs come from?

02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:16.080
Possibly actually. I wouldn't be surprised.

02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:18.080
I had a Reese's egg.

02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:19.080
Yummy.

02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:21.080
It's so good.

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:23.080
I would eat a chocolate peanut butter filled egg.

02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:25.080
You know what though?

02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:28.080
My favorite eggs always and I'm sorry I haven't been to a touch of Britain lately.

02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:30.080
Are Mars eggs.

02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:33.080
If anyone in England wants to send me Mars eggs, please do.

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:35.080
Because they're amazing.

02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:36.080
Okay.

02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:37.080
Just saying.

02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:38.080
All right.

02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:41.080
Oh, you might find them at the not just the touch of Britain.

02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:44.080
But that store at the lolly and pop or whatever it is that has all the import stuff.

02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:45.080
The mall.

02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:46.080
It's expensive though.

02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:47.080
It's expensive.

02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:48.080
But they have it.

02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:49.080
I haven't been there.

02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:51.080
Touch of Britain would always just sell them for like 75 cents.

02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:52.080
That's not bad at all.

02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:53.080
Yeah.

02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:55.080
But I could also get like rhubarb custard candies.

02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:56.080
And spotted dick.

02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:58.080
And spotted dick.

02:05:58.080 --> 02:05:59.080
All right.

02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:02.080
Let's just get a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line.

02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:03.080
Which you can give us a call.

02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:04.080
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:05.080
All one word on Skype.

02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:07.080
But first, Loki.

02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:12.080
Sadly, once again, to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of Grand Theft Auto 4.

02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:15.080
Rockstar has to remove some music from the game.

02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:18.080
Much like they do with San Andreas and even Vice City.

02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:26.080
So, apparently on the 26th there's going to be an update that's going to remove quite a few songs from the game.

02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:31.080
Apparently the rumor is that these are all part of the Russian pop station.

02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:37.080
Was it Vladivostok FM?

02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:38.080
I believe that's how you pronounce it.

02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:40.080
It's been a while since I played the game.

02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:42.080
Honestly, my favorite station in the whole game.

02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:45.080
Because it had all the cool electronica music in there.

02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:48.080
And they had like piano by Eric Prides and stuff like that.

02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:51.080
That was my jam when I was killing people in the game at least.

02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:54.080
But they're going to replace it with something.

02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:58.080
So I guess we'll find out in a couple weeks what exactly they're replacing it with.

02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:02.080
And if it sucks, there's always mods to put it back in.

02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:07.080
Or just don't plug in your thing to download the patch.

02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:08.080
Or if the patch...

02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:10.080
Eh, it's Steam. It's going to download it anyways.

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:12.080
You can stop it from downloading.

02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:15.080
Eh, I just don't care.

02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:17.080
That's probably what they're thinking most people do.

02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:20.080
They probably have to do this because of, again, the licensing.

02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:21.080
Music licensing, yeah.

02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:23.080
Exactly. So they have to kind of do their due diligence.

02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:25.080
But there will be ways around it. You're absolutely right.

02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:26.080
Modding will put it right back in.

02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:27.080
Yeah.

02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:29.080
If not, you know...

02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:32.080
Or maybe the new songs are going to be badass. Who knows?

02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:35.080
Alright. Well, you want to be careful when you're surfing around the internet.

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:41.080
Because sometimes if you download the wrong thing, too much porn, you might end up with ransomware on your PC.

02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.080
Nah, you never get ransomware from downloading porn.

02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:45.080
Alright, well, alright. Anyway.

02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:48.080
We're downloading free games. Piracy. That's how you get it.

02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:49.080
Eh, yeah.

02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:50.080
If you're not careful.

02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:52.080
Anyway, not that you should be doing that.

02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:55.080
But anyway, this is an interesting new sort of ransomware.

02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:58.080
And you might be hearing about this around the internet.

02:07:58.080 --> 02:08:03.080
This is a new malware where your computer is all locked up and all the files are encrypted and stuff.

02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:08.080
And you can't unlock them until you play Player Unknown Battlegrounds.

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:11.080
That's it. They don't want your money. They don't want your Bitcoin.

02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:13.080
Guess who doesn't have to worry about that?

02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:19.080
You just have to play Player Unknown Battlegrounds for one hour.

02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:22.080
The software will make the file inaccessible when you get infected by this.

02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:25.080
Which usually is, you know, the whole Bitcoin thing.

02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:29.080
But for this, don't worry. I don't want money. Just play PUBG for one hour.

02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:33.080
What if I don't have PUBG and then now I have to download it?

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:34.080
You're gonna have to buy it, I guess. There it is.

02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:36.080
Guess who doesn't have to worry about that shit?

02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:37.080
On the Mac?

02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:38.080
I love my Mac.

02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:40.080
Because PUBG won't run on that.

02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:42.080
But on top of that, viruses also.

02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:46.080
Nah, you're not immune. You're not immune to viruses on that thing.

02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:47.080
But.

02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:48.080
There are less of them.

02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:50.080
There are a bajillion times easier to remove.

02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:55.080
So anyway, malware experts have confirmed this is really what it does.

02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:57.080
It really does lock down the files.

02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:01.080
But they do say it's pretty easy to get around because it only encrypts the desktop files.

02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:06.080
And then unlocks them after three minutes in Battlegrounds, not an hour.

02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:11.080
That's about the amount of time it takes to go into a game, get killed, and that's it.

02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:14.080
So there's also other workarounds if you want.

02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:17.080
Maybe you would rather play Fortnite. I don't know.

02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:20.080
There's an unlock code if you really can't be bothered.

02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:22.080
I guess that's...

02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:25.080
There is an unlock code if you really, really can't be bothered.

02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:26.080
What's the point?

02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:28.080
That's very good.

02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:30.080
Actually, one of the malware experts said,

02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:36.080
it's unsure if this is something you will actually be spread or if it's just being made as a joke.

02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:40.080
You know, sometimes some programmers up and coming in college,

02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:46.080
they actually write viruses to learn as part of the programming and the intricate workings of a computer.

02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:52.080
But they contain things like this that are very easy to shut down so they don't actually pose a real threat.

02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:55.080
So I wonder if this wasn't just somebody's pet project where it's like,

02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:59.080
I want to just see if I can do it, but I don't want it to actually hurt people.

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:02.080
So, kind of interesting.

02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:03.080
I don't know.

02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:05.080
Yeah, Tigerclaw says it could be worse.

02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:08.080
They could force you to get winner, winner, chicken dinner to unlock your computer.

02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:11.080
Winner, winner, unlock key.

02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:14.080
That's alright. Fortnite's what I prefer anyway.

02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:15.080
No, I'm just kidding. I haven't played either of them.

02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:18.080
I watch people play Fortnite and I'm like so overwhelmed.

02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:23.080
Like, how do they build stuff so fast in that game?

02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:27.080
Well, now they have the whole like in the shelter, like portable shelter thing.

02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:30.080
Oh, really? That's interesting.

02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:32.080
One of my friends, by the way, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.

02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:35.080
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:37.080
Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:43.080
One of my friends that I know through Ingress who's like, he just started doing game streaming.

02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:45.080
He was playing Fortnite and I was watching his stream.

02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:50.080
And first off, I was laughing my ass off because he was playing like a team Fortnite game.

02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:55.080
And he had three other people on his team that were all like nine and ten year olds.

02:10:55.080 --> 02:11:00.080
And I could hear their voices were like, they were like screaming on top of each other.

02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:03.080
And I could like hear parents in the background. It was crazy.

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:05.080
But I was, I was laughing and having a good time.

02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:07.080
I would love this. I could play Fortnite.

02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:09.080
I just don't have a place to do it very quietly.

02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:12.080
Oh, yeah. You'd have the same thing with screaming kids in the background.

02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:14.080
Anyway, we got a call coming in. Let's do it.

02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:16.080
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:17.080
Hey, what's up, everyone? It's Ranma.

02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:19.080
Hey, Ranma. How you doing, buddy?

02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:20.080
I'm doing good. How about you?

02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:22.080
I am super. Thanks for asking.

02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:26.080
Why am I not surprised you said that?

02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:28.080
What's on your mind, my friend?

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:32.080
There's a lot of stuff on my mind, but I will say that for another time.

02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:41.080
I just want to say, last week, I saw Ready Player One, motherfucking movie of the year.

02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:44.080
Is that only the year?

02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:48.080
I don't care. It's movie of the year. I don't care.

02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:55.080
I went all out. I saw it in 4DX. I was like, I have to go back and see this movie again.

02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:57.080
Nice. I'm sure Loki approves.

02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:01.080
What did you like, without spoiling, what did you like so much about it?

02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:05.080
I actually like more the aspects of the cameo appearances

02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:09.080
because I'm one of those who looks for things like the Easter eggs.

02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:13.080
So I spent half the time pointing out the different characters and stuff like that

02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:17.080
and just fanboying the poor little nerd that I am.

02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:25.080
Fair enough. So you're a fan of the Easter egg extravaganza that they do in the game.

02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:29.080
Yeah, I just wasn't expecting so many. I really enjoyed the storyline.

02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:34.080
I just enjoyed the movie as a whole and the whole virtual reality experience.

02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:38.080
And I'm like, if you think about it, we're not too far from that, you know?

02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:40.080
Oh.

02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:46.080
I just have to go back and see it again in 3D this time.

02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:47.080
Alright.

02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:50.080
Have you seen it yet? I don't remember.

02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:52.080
I haven't. Loki has. I haven't.

02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:55.080
Sadly, it is not the movie I'm seeing tonight.

02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:59.080
I'm seeing Love, Simon tonight because I figure with Avengers coming out,

02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:01.080
Love, Simon's going to be gone.

02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:04.080
There's only so much theater space.

02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:06.080
I totally get that. I totally do.

02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:09.080
Yeah, but Ready Player One, I still haven't seen it.

02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:12.080
You have to see Ready Player One in 4D. Seriously.

02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:15.080
I will. I'm so uncool, Rama. I still haven't seen Black Panther.

02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:19.080
Neither have I. Do you know I've been raked across the coals for it.

02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:21.080
Really? Why?

02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:26.080
I don't want to get political or anything like that.

02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:31.080
It's just that a lot of people look at me like, well, you're black.

02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:33.080
You should go see Black Panther.

02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:37.080
And my response is, I'm not really big on the Marvel movies.

02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:42.080
Age of Ultron left a sour taste in my mouth and I just have been a big Marvel fan.

02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:47.080
Even though I need to go see it because two of my friends were in the film as stunt doubles,

02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:51.080
but I will eventually get around to when it's up to it.

02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:55.080
It's just that my tastes in movies are different from everybody else's.

02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:58.080
And like I said, I was more hyped.

02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:02.080
Honestly, I'm more hyped for Ready Player One and Alita Battle Angel,

02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:08.080
which just got pushed to December over Black Panther, Infinity War and all of that.

02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:11.080
It's not my nerdom, you know?

02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:13.080
That's fair. I mean, I get it.

02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:17.080
But I don't want to say I see both sides because at the same time it's your money.

02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:18.080
Spend it how you want.

02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:22.080
But I do also understand the desire of people to want to elevate Black Panther

02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:26.080
because we need to show Hollywood that they should be making more movies

02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:32.080
that star Black people that are not like, you know, maids and gang members

02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:34.080
and the things that we saw in the 90s.

02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:35.080
Kids need the representation.

02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:37.080
Exactly. Representation. So I get it.

02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:38.080
And I totally get that.

02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:39.080
Yeah.

02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:46.080
But I just feel like I shouldn't have to go see it to show the representation like I'm required to.

02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:48.080
I'd rather go see it of my own volition.

02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:53.080
There is absolutely hundreds of other types of Black arts you could support.

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:54.080
I get it.

02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:57.080
Yeah. And the movie is so popular.

02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:01.080
It's just, hell, a couple of times I have work.

02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:04.080
People are threatening to pull my Black card because I haven't seen it.

02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:06.080
And I'm like, look.

02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:10.080
I didn't know there were Black cards, too, because did you know there's gay cards as well?

02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:11.080
Oh, I believe it.

02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:15.080
And I've said to people, look, my Black card was pulled about 15 years ago.

02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:18.080
If you want it here, just get on the line.

02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:23.080
If I somehow get it again, I will raffle it off so whoever wins the raffle can pull my card.

02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:27.080
Because I kind of don't want it.

02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:28.080
All right. All right.

02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:30.080
Anyway, what else I want to ask you?

02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:33.080
Oh, anything else you want to share with us tonight?

02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:39.080
The thing is, I was also reminiscing about the talk about Space Channel 5.

02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:41.080
And then I heard the talk about DDR.

02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:46.080
And I'm just reminded about 10 years ago, a bunch of my friends, one of them, Jez,

02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:48.080
I think you met him at Capsicon once.

02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:53.080
We actually did a Space Channel 5 versus Dance Dance Revolution skit.

02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:55.080
Nice. That's awesome.

02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:58.080
And we were going to go all out.

02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:02.080
After Team DDR and Team Space Channel 5 battled each other,

02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:05.080
we were going to have a giant space Michael to come out.

02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:08.080
We were going to join forces and dance to take him out and all of that.

02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:11.080
But we did not have enough time to get that done together.

02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:14.080
Well, you know what? There's always next year.

02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:18.080
No, no, I'm done.

02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:23.080
I'm like Danny, when it comes to masquerade skits now,

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:25.080
I'm like Danny Glover from Lethal Weapon.

02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:27.080
I'm getting too old for this shit.

02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:34.080
I have to prepare my body three months in advance of stretches, calisthenics,

02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:36.080
training, remembering how to dance.

02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:37.080
You're missing your calling.

02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:40.080
You're missing your calling, stage parent.

02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:42.080
Shh.

02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:48.080
Honestly, I'd rather sit there, record the masquerade,

02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:53.080
have my flask, I'd be a snarky ass motherfucker on Twitter about the skits.

02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:57.080
Oh, I see. Like the old guys who sit up in the balcony on the Muppets.

02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:58.080
I understand completely.

02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:00.080
Yes, that was in World War.

02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:04.080
All right, Rama, I'm going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call.

02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:05.080
You take care, okay?

02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:07.080
You stay awesome, my friend.

02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:09.080
I will always. You stay fabulous yourself.

02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:10.080
Oh, you know it, honey.

02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:11.080
All right, bye.

02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:17.080
Orange Laundry Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to get through.

02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:20.080
Again, that's Orange Laundry Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:23.080
I should check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.

02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:24.080
No.

02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:25.080
No?

02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:26.080
There's nothing.

02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:27.080
How about you, Dark Soccer?

02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:29.080
Anything last minute you want to talk about?

02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:31.080
No, and these are all expensive.

02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:32.080
What's expensive?

02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:36.080
The tank tops I'm looking at, and there's one that looks like Cora's outfit.

02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:37.080
Oh, for your Disney stuff again?

02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:42.080
But it's a cold shoulder shirt, you know, like her outfit was, but it's going to be in May.

02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:43.080
I'm going to burn.

02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:44.080
Oh, yeah.

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:45.080
So I'm looking for tank tops.

02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:49.080
It was crazy hot today just out catching Pokémon, and then it's supposed to rain.

02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:51.080
I don't know if it rained during the show, but...

02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:52.080
The clouds were coming in.

02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:53.080
Jeez.

02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:54.080
Yeah.

02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:55.080
It's crazy how weather can change, doesn't it?

02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:56.080
Weather.

02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:58.080
It's fascinating.

02:17:58.080 --> 02:17:59.080
Crazy stuff.

02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:03.080
All right, well, that's going to do it, I guess, for the Skype line tonight.

02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:05.080
If you didn't get through, you can always send us an email.

02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:09.080
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place where you can send us an email,

02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:17.080
and you can also tweet us at O-L-R, or, of course, join in on the Discord, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:22.080
But we're going to move around and start to wrap up here tonight for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:25.080
Thank you, guys, as always, for listening to our show.

02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:26.080
We appreciate all the support.

02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:29.080
We would really, really appreciate it if you tell a friend or two about the show.

02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:32.080
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:34.080
but we need the voices here in order to air them.

02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:35.080
You know what else is great?

02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:38.080
It's a nice five-star review on iTunes.

02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:41.080
In the past year, we've gotten one, so it would be fantastic.

02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:45.080
I say it every week, so if you guys could please, please leave us a nice review.

02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:48.080
It would super be appreciated here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:49.080
Thank you so much.

02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:53.080
I should say one in the U.S. store, because I don't always get a chance to check Canada and U.K.

02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:55.080
I try to check them once in a while.

02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:58.080
I think there's some website where you can see them all, but I always forget to do that.

02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:02.080
So if I'm neglecting an overseas review, I apologize.

02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:06.080
I tend to focus on the U.S. store, because it is kind of a bitch to hop around all the different markets.

02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:11.080
But a nice five-star review somewhere else, like Google Play or one of those places would be great, too.

02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:13.080
Super appreciate that.

02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:19.080
And yeah, just be here and participate with our show, and we'll keep making them for you.

02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:22.080
We'll be back next week with Episode 727.

02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:27.080
But before we wrap it up here tonight, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:28.080
And I'll start with my final thought.

02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:31.080
My final thought is movie adventure.

02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:32.080
Yay, movies.

02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:36.080
Even though it's a Sunday night and I have a class to teach tomorrow, I'm going to be dead tired.

02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:37.080
But that's all right.

02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:38.080
Fun, fun.

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:40.080
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:44.080
My final thought is hopefully I'll play more games this week.

02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:49.080
And hopefully I'll be awake enough to actually work on a game.

02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:51.080
I've been trying.

02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:52.080
It's just not been working.

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:54.080
My head's been killing me.

02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:56.080
Or I've been just exhausted at the end of the day.

02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:58.080
Does your promotion start Monday, or did it start this last week?

02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:01.080
Well, it technically started last week.

02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:04.080
But we're still in the transition phase of moving me over to the stuff.

02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:06.080
So I've been kind of still doing my old job.

02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:09.080
And so, I mean, I've been sort of doing the new stuff, too.

02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:13.080
And kind of what I did with my old job is sort of what I do with my new job.

02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:15.080
I don't know. It's slowly getting there.

02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:17.080
At least the paycheck's coming up.

02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:19.080
Oh, the paycheck definitely came.

02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:22.080
In fact, I think they retroactively paid me for the whole last period.

02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:25.080
So I got paid for my previous position and the new position.

02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:26.080
Nice.

02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:27.080
On top of it.

02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:29.080
So I may be looking to get a switch soon.

02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:30.080
Oh, there you go.

02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:31.080
I want to.

02:20:31.080 --> 02:20:32.080
But I have to pass that.

02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:36.080
The wife will not be happy with that because I bought a DDR machine.

02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:40.080
I was not supposed to get any more anythings for a long time.

02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:41.080
I'll buy her something she wants.

02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:42.080
Tiller's research for the show.

02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:43.080
Yeah, research.

02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:45.080
No, that'll never fly.

02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:46.080
Tiller, you won it.

02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:47.080
All right.

02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:50.080
Dark Soccer, last but not least, your final thought tonight?

02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:53.080
It's going to be a long wait for DragCon.

02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:55.080
It'll be here before you know it.

02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:56.080
It's like three weeks away.

02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:59.080
Yeah, but at least this week is this week.

02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:01.080
I also learned something, Rob.

02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:04.080
And here's a little tip for people who are poor.

02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:07.080
If you go out for Mongolian barbecue and they let you take home your leftovers,

02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:11.080
save it, cook up some rice and make fried rice out of it the next day.

02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:13.080
It's actually delicious.

02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:14.080
It tastes like drunk food.

02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:16.080
I need to have more Mongolian barbecue.

02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:17.080
Sounds delicious.

02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:20.080
Anyway, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange L'Antrayo.

02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:22.080
We'll see you in seven days to do it all again next time.

02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:24.080
Until then, bye.

02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:56.080
See you next week.

02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:25.080
Thank you.
