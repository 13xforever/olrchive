0	17900	This week Microsoft's new Xbox One update allows you to give input control to a mixer
17900	18900	stream viewer.
18900	21940	There are many possible uses for this and personally I'm excited to see them.
21940	24900	That's just one change in store, join us for the rest of the week's gaming news starting
24900	29980	right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
29980	34540	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back.
34540	37280	It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37280	43500	It's Orange Lounge Radio, back live tonight, April the 29th, 2018, episode number 728 of
43500	44500	our show.
44500	50180	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here in Studio N7, lovely Sacramento, California,
50180	53380	with my co-hosts over there, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
53380	54380	Hi.
54380	55380	Hi, how are you?
55380	56380	I'm here.
56380	57380	Good.
57380	60980	I'm excited for your DragCon event in two weeks, right?
60980	61980	Two weeks?
61980	62980	I'm ready and nervous.
62980	69020	I've got a lot of stuff to do and some of the things that I ordered are deceptively
69020	71980	not real human body size.
71980	75260	Can we talk about the outfit you were talking about before the show or is that going to
75260	76260	be a secret?
76260	77260	It's fine.
77260	80300	Because it's game related and I love it.
80300	81300	Which one was game related?
81300	82300	The Kirby.
82300	85940	Oh no, I wasn't going to do a Kirby outfit, I was going to do a top hat.
85940	86940	Oh, kind of.
86940	88380	As the hat challenge.
88380	89380	A Kirby.
89380	91500	It's more Drag Race related.
91500	92500	Alright, fine.
92500	93500	Whatever.
93500	94500	I wasn't going to do Kirby at all.
94500	95500	Oh, I thought it was a Kirby.
95500	96500	No.
96500	97500	Oh, a Kirby.
97500	98500	Oh, damn.
98500	99500	I thought that whole time you were going to...
99500	101180	I'm going to do a Kirby top hat.
101180	103180	I thought you were talking about a Kirby.
103180	109180	I mean, I could do a Kirby, Jiggly's already done it I think.
109180	110940	Now you need to do a Jiggly look.
110940	117980	No, if I was going to do one, I would do like a Q-Bone outfit with a skull on my head or
117980	118980	something.
118980	119980	Oh, okay.
119980	120980	I like that.
120980	121980	A little Pokemon.
121980	122980	Yeah.
122980	123980	Alright.
123980	124980	Pokemon, first drag at a ball.
124980	125980	Category is.
125980	126980	Alright.
126980	131420	But no, I have my Shirley Manson inspired outfit.
131420	134340	Hey, Shirley Manson is still awesome.
134340	138460	That's just depending on if I do Sister Face or if I do drag and if I do drag then I bust
138460	140260	out the Shirley Manson wig.
140260	141260	Alright.
141260	145180	Well, looking forward to seeing all that on your social medias in a couple of weeks when
145180	146180	that all goes down.
146180	147180	If I remember, I have one.
147180	148180	Alright.
148180	149180	Also say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
149180	150180	Hello.
150180	151180	Hi, Loki.
151180	152180	How are you?
152180	153180	I'm good.
153180	154180	Good.
154180	155180	Have you seen Ready Player One again this week at all?
155180	157580	No, I went and saw two other movies inside.
157580	159580	So I saw Avengers Infinity War.
159580	160580	Of course.
160580	161580	Everybody's seeing Avengers.
161580	162580	I didn't go see it.
162580	163580	I know.
163580	164580	I am so uncool.
164580	165580	I had a migraine last night.
165580	166580	I am so uncool.
166580	170220	And I'm not trying to be like that edgy guy that's like, I'm going to hate the popular
170380	171380	thing.
171380	172380	Dan saw it.
172380	176540	And I, I just, I haven't seen, okay, so like I saw this brilliant post.
176540	177540	It was on Facebook.
177540	179100	I don't see much that's brilliant on Facebook.
179100	180100	It already got spoiled for me.
180100	181580	But it was a, well, don't.
181580	182580	I'm not.
182580	183580	Okay.
183580	188140	Um, but you know, like there's like this flow chart that was like, this is the Marvel universe
188140	191960	and it showed like all these movies and how they're connected and the order it goes.
191960	198060	And I was like, I have seen that one, that one and that one.
198060	200700	It was like four movies on that entire chart I'd seen.
200700	203940	I'm like, I'm not, I still need to see Black Panther.
203940	205820	I've seen all of them, but Black Panthers.
205820	209740	So Oh my God, that's the one, like everybody did see both of the guardians of the galaxy
209740	210740	movies, right?
210740	211740	No.
211740	212740	Okay.
212740	213740	I'm kidnapping you.
213740	214740	I am the uncoolest.
214740	216300	I know the guardians of galaxy movies are the best.
216300	217920	It's on Netflix, dude.
217920	218920	Is it the second one?
218920	223340	All right, well, well, I've got the Blu-rays anyways, but I want to play video games.
223340	224340	I don't have time for movies.
224340	225340	Okay.
225340	226340	Do it.
226340	227580	I do play them while you're watching the movie.
227580	228580	How was the other one?
228580	229580	The Quiet Place?
229580	232760	Cause I'd go see that because you don't need to see other movies first.
232760	234060	The Quiet Place is good.
234060	240820	Um, it was just a really intense, you know, edge of your seat horror movie, I guess.
240820	247340	Um, I can see, I heard a rumor that at one time they were trying to do that stupid nonsense
247340	252380	where, Oh, Hey, let's take these random movies and make them part of the Cloverfield universe.
252380	258900	And I could see how that could sort of be part of the Cloverfield universe in a very,
258900	262780	we're really stretching to see the connection here, but do you know what weird thing I read
262780	263780	this week?
263780	267260	And I don't even remember where maybe somebody in our chat room knows over at live.vognetwork.com
267260	271380	because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network, vognetwork.com
271380	275060	six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black Wolf show.
275060	278760	Although Bobby is on a little brief hiatus while he takes care of some other things.
278760	280300	So wishing Bobby well.
280340	284380	Um, but anyway, uh, so we are live, so join our chat room unless you're listening on the
284380	285380	podcast.
285380	287940	Then, um, you can go see the chat rooms open 24 seven.
287940	292300	There just might not be anybody there, but anyway, uh, where was I dang it, I was gonna
292300	293300	Cloverfield.
293300	294300	Oh yes.
294300	295300	Okay.
295300	299540	So did you read the thing online about how the Tomb Raider movie, there was a proposal
299540	307180	that that would be in the same universe as just cause hit man, um, all the other stuff
307180	313280	that like they want to turn into movies from like American game studios specifically I'd
313280	318680	asked fine with it, but I like, how would that cross over though, Laura Croft and hit
318680	325740	man and like they all, I don't know, but that would be an awesome, awesome to do what exactly
325740	328220	I regal Rodriguez in, you know, Laura Croft.
328220	333260	I'm down, I'm down for just a just cause movie, honestly, because that's gonna be batshit
333260	334260	insane.
334260	335260	You gotta have Jason Statham.
335380	341260	That's totally un, you know, not going to match the nationality of the main character
341260	342260	at all.
342260	346240	But I just see something like that has to be as crazy as like one of the crank movies
346240	347240	or something.
347240	348240	Right.
348240	350060	But yeah, I'm down with something like that.
350060	354740	I just, I haven't watched any of the hitman movies, so I don't really know how those would
354740	356460	really play into it, but sure.
356460	357460	Why not?
357460	358700	Everyone's wants to make a cinematic universe.
358700	363180	Uh, let's see tiger call out chat over at live.vog network.com says a video game cinematic
363180	364180	universe.
364180	369300	I'm not going to have that with ready player one kind of that's a stretch.
369300	370300	That's a stretch.
370300	371300	Anyway.
371300	372300	All right.
372300	373300	Uh, let's see.
373300	374300	So, okay.
374300	375300	Uh, something else I have to address with you.
375300	376300	Well, let me come back.
376300	377300	Cause I have to introduce, we have a guest in studio.
377300	379840	We always want to say hello to our guests because we haven't had a guest in studio in
379840	383580	like a long time, but, uh, we have an old fave back here on the show this week.
383580	387300	Say hello to longtime music, game, fan, lover, et cetera.
387300	388300	JD.
388300	389300	Hey.
389300	390300	Hi.
390300	391300	How are you?
391300	392300	I'm doing pretty well.
392300	393300	Yeah.
393420	398620	Um, I mean, not much any movies.
398620	399620	Oh yeah.
399620	402300	I saw a game night a couple of weeks ago.
402300	403300	Okay.
403300	404300	That's like board game night.
404300	405300	Right?
405300	406300	Yeah.
406300	407740	I mean, it's a thriller about board games and a friend group.
407740	408740	Like it's pretty fun.
408740	409740	I didn't know that's a thriller.
409740	412060	I thought it was a comedy.
412060	413060	It's a comedy thriller.
413060	416060	Oh, cause I was like, Oh, so like scream.
416060	417060	Yeah.
417060	421220	Or, or well more like, like scream three that when they started getting a little more batshit,
421220	422780	I've only seen the first one.
422780	426700	Oh, well you're not missing much.
426700	430540	Scream two and three are like, okay, they're, they're worth your time, but not when you're
430540	432500	behind on 70,000 Marvel movies.
432500	433500	Like I am.
433500	434500	All right.
434500	435500	Yeah.
435500	436500	I've been like, nothing's new in my life.
436500	437500	Okay.
437500	438500	That's cool.
438500	439500	Uh, but you're, you're doing more Pokemon go.
439500	440500	We had fun playing that.
440500	441500	Yeah.
441500	442500	Right.
442500	443500	Yeah.
443500	444500	Yeah.
444500	445500	It comes in and goes like when there's events, I'll log in and when there's not, you know,
445500	446980	but we'll cover that on my gaming week.
446980	447980	Okay.
447980	451400	Cause I was going to say he's downplaying it just a little bit because this whole weekend
451400	455320	as we've been going around from place to place, it'll be like, Ooh, Wailmer, Ooh, Magikarp,
455320	456320	Ooh, Wailmer.
456320	459040	Well, see, I have a lot of catching up to do cause I don't play all the time.
459040	460040	I understand.
460040	461040	I understand.
461040	462720	That's the great thing about these events though, is that they allow you to catch up.
462720	463720	Right.
463720	464720	All right.
464720	466960	Well, we'll come back to you during your gaming week then and get the full pogo story, but
466960	467960	let's go to Loki.
467960	471720	Um, before we get to the kickoff topic, I think this is worth addressing because you've
471720	474460	been alluding to this on social media.
474460	477800	And then you came in here tonight and said, Rob, I need to borrow some of your amiibo.
477800	478800	I'm not borrowing.
478800	480320	I have it with me.
480320	484160	So I know, I know, but that's like, you're, you're borrowing it for five seconds.
484160	485760	You're not like longterm borrowing it.
485760	488480	But then I kind of went click, click, click, wait a minute.
488480	491080	There was a photo of his kid playing a switch.
491080	493240	Did you finally buy Nintendo switch?
493240	498560	Yes, we, we traded in the Wii U system that you got me a while back and how could you
498560	499560	trade a gift?
499560	500560	No, I'm kidding.
500560	501560	It's totally cool.
501560	502560	That's, that's what happens in gaming.
502560	507040	Well, I didn't want to, but the, the rule is my wife, wife said you have to get rid
507040	508640	of something in order to get something new.
508640	512400	So it's a worthy upgrade and it is it.
512400	518480	It's bittersweet, I guess, because my son, he really, really wanted to switch, but at
518480	523800	the same time he's like, Oh, I, I'm playing through super Mario three D world right now.
523800	525680	And it's like, I'm almost finished with it.
525680	527720	I'm like, well, you sure you want to get switched in?
527720	529480	We can, you know, do this another time.
529480	530480	No, no, no.
530480	531480	I want to get switched.
531480	532480	And then we got switched.
532480	536280	He's like, man, I kind of wish we didn't get a switch cause I wanted to play there, but,
536280	541400	yeah, he's been playing nonstop, you know, Mario Odyssey and always focus on that one.
541400	543720	So we got a switch and, um, did all that.
543720	548160	But so I just, I just want the Nintendo fans who, who all Loki sometimes ruffles their
548160	549160	feathers.
549160	551120	I just want the date and time noted.
551120	554000	Loki is finally on board with a switch.
554000	555000	There we go.
555000	556000	Yeah.
556000	561560	So now I can hate on it, you know, you know, from firsthand experience on it with, uh,
561560	566240	with, uh, like seriously, like when the e-shop, like, geez.
566240	569560	Way to put no effort into that interface.
569560	574120	Like that's even less interface or less effort into an interface than there was on the Wii.
574120	575520	I mean, it's ridiculous.
575520	579560	Oh, dark Tetsuya in chat says, I got a request from Loki on my system.
579560	582880	Wondering if I should do the same since I don't even use my Wii U anymore.
582880	585880	Oh, I guess I should log into my switch and see if Loki sent me a friend request.
585880	588880	I didn't because you're not linked to Facebook or Twitter.
588880	590880	So apparently not.
590880	594340	I unlinked all of that stuff on purpose though.
594340	598140	So I just haven't bothered to go out and share the friend code that I have.
598140	601940	Um, I just was really quickly going through and just doing it through the system.
601940	605180	I'm like, okay, we'll see if this is all linked together and everything.
605180	606460	So I did all that.
606460	607460	Yeah.
607460	610580	Dungeon buster in chat says Loki now has authoritative Nintendo hate.
610580	611960	Oh, absolutely.
611960	613860	So I hate because I love, that's right.
613860	614860	What games?
614860	615860	Yeah.
615860	616860	You're the Tyra Banks of the show.
616860	619840	What was the, um, what was the, uh, games you got?
619840	622340	You said Mario Odyssey, Mario Odyssey and Mario Kart 8.
622340	623340	Mario Kart 8.
623340	624340	I like the two.
624340	625340	No Zelda yet.
625340	627580	No, because I didn't play, you had Zelda on the Wii U.
627580	631460	I had, well, I didn't play it on the Wii U and that's, I didn't play it very much.
631460	632460	Okay.
632460	635580	You know, so I will get Zelda at one point, but I'm like, I'm not gonna buy another game.
635580	637140	I'm not going to get to right away.
637140	638460	I'll pick it up later.
638460	640560	Um, I'm in no hurry yet.
640560	648000	We have a, I bought a 128 gigabyte memory card, so I'm just gonna download stuff as
648000	652540	I feel like it, but I just, I know I'm not going to get to Zelda right now, so I'm not
652540	656500	going to buy it right now because it, I mean, all those accessories and everything are so
656500	657500	expensive.
657500	659980	Nintendo stuff like never goes on sale either.
659980	663460	Like you're still, you're still going to pay 60 bucks for Zelda, right?
663460	666980	And I'm not, you know, I'm not worried about that, but I'm just saying I don't want to
666980	670580	pick it up right now because I'm not going to get to it right now.
670580	675040	I'll just play through Mario Odyssey for now and then all the other games on the other
675040	678380	systems I have and oh shit, there's my scene backlog.
678380	681080	You know, it's like there's too much.
681080	682400	What about Splatoon?
682400	683400	I don't like Splatoon.
683400	684400	Okay.
684400	687460	I mean, I bought the first Splatoon and I was like, oh yeah, it's gonna be awesome.
687460	688460	I never played it.
688460	690640	I'll lend you my copy of Arms.
690640	693080	I know that really does not look good.
693080	694880	The kids will think it's fun though.
694880	695880	That's a good point.
695880	696880	Let the kids try it.
696880	699640	I mean, they might like that, but like, and then that's a problem because they don't have
699640	700640	to buy it.
700640	701640	Well, no, not really.
701640	702640	I mean, it's Splatoon.
702640	705000	It's just like, I just don't think I'll play it.
705000	706520	I mean, that's a problem.
706520	708560	How about Smash Brothers this holiday?
708560	710360	I'll pick, I'll pick up Smash Brothers when it comes out.
710360	711360	That's a must have.
711360	715880	I like Smash Brothers, but like, I just didn't want, like, and I even thought about Splatoon
715880	718680	2 and like, no, I didn't play the first one.
718680	721640	I just didn't really get into it.
721640	726040	Over in chat at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, is there an Arms demo Loki can
726040	727040	try?
727040	730880	They had a test fire or whatever they called it, an Arms fire or whatever they called that
730880	731880	thing.
731880	733080	They have demos for some things and I may pick those up.
733080	735880	They had one previously, but isn't there, wouldn't there supposed to be more Arms like
735880	738320	for some reason, like coming up in the coming weeks?
738320	740960	Like maybe they're trying to get more people to buy Arms.
740960	741960	I don't know.
741960	745080	I believe they had a free weekend a couple of weeks ago and they've been doing it every
745080	746080	so often.
746080	747080	They're already passed.
747080	748080	I'll check it out when it's free.
748080	749240	I mean, it just didn't look very interesting.
749240	754200	I'm very disappointed and I mean, I know a lot of people have shared this complaint,
754200	758080	but like one of the things like I brought when I got in the system was like, it would
758080	761120	have been nice to be able to pick up all those virtual console games I had already.
761120	764520	They're literally losing out money because I would have dropped money for all those games
764520	765520	they have in there.
765520	768040	You know, like Mario 64, that was the other game that he was playing through.
768040	769200	He was playing through Mario 64.
769200	770960	I would have downloaded Mario 64 again.
770960	775840	I would have paid the full $10 or whatever the fucking ridiculous price for virtual console
775840	777640	game again, but they didn't have it available.
777640	780760	So they're literally losing money because of that.
780760	782200	So guess what I'm going to have to do instead?
782200	784520	I'm just saying they put it on emulator.
784520	790080	So sorry Nintendo, you had an opportunity to get much more money from me, but because
790080	793760	of whatever bullshit excuse you're going to use, you didn't.
793760	798160	Well, we have some news coming up later in the show that maybe we'll finally get word
798160	802440	on what's happening on Mario 64 and the other virtual console stuff, but we will get to
802440	804000	that later in the show.
804000	807720	Let's jump into our kickoff topic tonight, which actually has nothing to do with Nintendo
807720	808720	and our gaming weeks.
808720	809720	Yes, of course.
809720	810720	Our gaming weeks as well.
810720	814060	We'll start with our kickoff topic as we usually do here at the top of the show, which has
814060	816240	to do not with Nintendo, but with Microsoft.
816240	817240	Right?
817240	818240	Yeah.
818240	820600	So Microsoft and discord are, I guess, teaming up.
820600	825720	And so they have this, um, Xbox heart discord thing where you can link your account, sync
825720	829280	your friends, and I guess, um, display which games you're playing.
829280	830840	I don't want to sync my friends.
830840	832560	I like them.
832560	838860	So yeah, you can do that on PC and console and, um, it's interesting.
838860	844400	So how it works is it doesn't sound like it's much like, it's not like Xbox live is suddenly
844400	849540	integrating discord chattery that it's just like, uh, it's like how discord, uh, integrated
849580	851100	Spotify not that long ago.
851100	853540	You can see what people are listening to on Spotify, but that's it.
853540	854540	It's just their little stuff.
854540	857380	Maybe you can share stuff to it because they have a basic lens, the same.
857380	860060	It's linking like a social media account.
860060	864180	So like Facebook and Twitter, so you can like maybe post to it, you know, Hey, I just got
864180	865180	this achievement or something.
865180	866180	Yeah.
866180	867180	Then maybe, maybe you'll be able to do things like that.
867180	871040	But I think also like if you look on the sidebar, like, you know, cause, cause vog network has
871040	873100	a discord, cheap plug, cheap plug.
873100	877060	And so you'll see me on that discord and you can actually see what games I'm like as I,
877060	879640	I let it post, it's not a big deal.
879640	884340	You can actually see when I'm playing stuff on PC, you can see that, you know, Rob Roberts
884340	888880	is currently playing Diablo three, which has been a lot this week if, if I'm playing it
888880	889880	on PC.
889880	893200	But if I'm playing these on console, like if I'm playing DJ max on PlayStation four,
893200	897140	you don't see that on discord because the PlayStation doesn't talk to discord.
897140	899540	But now Microsoft will do that.
899540	903780	It sounds like, so you'll be able to see Rob Roberts is playing, I don't know, what do
903780	905300	I play on Xbox one anymore?
905740	909500	What was I was playing the Gianna sisters game this week to spoil my, my gaming week
909500	910500	a little bit.
910500	913740	So let's say Rob Roberts is playing Gianna sisters, twisted dreams or whatever.
913740	917180	And so maybe you decide, Oh, I want to join him in that game.
917180	920900	You could, you would know from your desktop discord or even your mobile that, Oh, Rob's
920900	922260	playing Gianna sisters.
922260	924820	I could jump in and join him right now or whatever it is on Xbox.
924820	929260	I mean, that's a neat for a lot of people I'm sure, right?
929260	933740	So yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm into this idea, but I mean it, it doesn't sound like it's
933740	935280	this gigantic Alliance.
935280	939120	It's just, Oh, discord is going to show your Xbox activity now.
939120	940120	Cool.
940120	944040	But it's still kind of like, this is a nice little foot in the door for Microsoft because
944040	948040	I think discord is one of those things in gaming and kind of what I wanted to talk about
948040	950240	here a little bit at the top of the show.
950240	954400	Discord's really been blowing up and gaming like, you know, nobody knew what discord was
954400	959400	what like two months ago or I'm sorry, not too much, two years ago.
959400	966540	Discord basically took the concept of chat and especially like team speak servers that
966540	967880	people were paying money for.
967880	970760	I think that's the big thing and made it free.
970760	974680	I'm not completely sure how discord is making enough money to keep those servers afloat.
974680	978160	I know they sell their premium subscriptions and things like that, but I don't know how
978160	981080	many people are actually buying those cause you can create servers for free.
981080	984680	There's a lot of conspiracy thoughts about like what discord might be doing with your
984680	985680	data.
985680	989360	Oh, they might be selling the play data or something or who knows, but like it's, it's
989360	992920	a Facebook kind of situation where it's like, well, if you don't, if you're not paying for
992920	994080	it, you are the product.
994080	995080	Yeah.
995080	996080	Yeah.
996080	997080	So, so who knows?
997080	1000640	But anyway, uh, discord's like blown up and I think especially you got two big things
1000640	1002920	to thank for discord blown up.
1002920	1004760	One of them is Pokemon go.
1004760	1009360	Like I, I mean, I know not everybody out there plays Pokemon go, but if you do play Pokemon
1009360	1014120	go because there is no chat within Pokemon go and this rating thing is such a big deal
1014120	1015880	and you've got to find other people to raid with.
1015880	1018680	Like discord has really taken over for Pokemon go.
1018680	1022300	That's how you find out where raids are and know when people are going to be there.
1022300	1026160	And I think so many people that necessarily wouldn't even necessarily play other games
1026160	1029440	because you know, there's plenty of people out there who play Pokemon go and don't play
1029440	1034200	other games, I think are getting exposed to discord and all of this stuff.
1034200	1039080	And then I think the other big thing that has really caused discord to blow up is Nintendo
1039080	1042080	because Nintendo doesn't really have an online solution.
1042080	1044880	A lot of people are going to discord to do their chats.
1044880	1048960	I mean, granted, there's, there's other stuff too, like MMOs, like all the people that were
1048960	1056080	using TeamSpeak before, like to do their raids, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy, Guild Wars,
1056080	1057720	all those MMOs online.
1057720	1062560	You know, why would people pay for a TeamSpeak server when you just go to their discord now?
1062560	1068120	So you know, discord is really, I think, wedge their foot in the door with all these different,
1068120	1069120	different things.
1069120	1072560	And so I think it's, it's really kind of transformed in some ways, a lot of the gaming stuff.
1072560	1077400	So it's interesting that discord is continuing to be like one unified kind of gaming ecosystem
1077400	1081840	instead of like Xbox Live being in their own bubble and PlayStation being in their own
1081840	1082840	bubble and so forth.
1082840	1088280	Because if you use discord, you can chat to anybody playing anything because the fact
1088280	1089800	that it's mobile is a big deal.
1089800	1090800	Yeah.
1090800	1096000	Uh, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Tiger Claw says, indeed, you can start your
1096000	1099120	own community in discord, which is what we did at VOG network.
1099120	1103880	And if you want to join our discord, you can over at vognetwork.com slash discord,
1103880	1105120	and that will just give you the invite.
1105120	1108320	You don't have to worry about an invite code because it'll just put it right in there for
1108320	1109320	you.
1109320	1112320	So we, uh, we, we want anybody to join.
1112320	1116560	Um, well, as long as you're not a dick, that's the general rule, right?
1116560	1121160	As Joan Hunter-Matt says, I'm worried someone will buy discord sometime soon and turn it
1121160	1124280	into an exclusivicity war.
1124280	1128760	Um, perhaps Microsoft would be a worthy suitor, huh?
1128760	1133320	However, blueberry follows that up in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, discord
1133320	1136020	has denied buyouts several times.
1136020	1142280	So anyway, uh, and Tiger Claw also points out the great thing about discord is you can
1142280	1144240	connect to multiple servers at once.
1144240	1145240	Oh, absolutely.
1145240	1150080	I mean, obviously I have the VOG network one, but I'm probably on like 10 different servers.
1150080	1154520	Uh, and that's, I think that's small fry compared to a lot of people I've heard of some people
1154520	1155520	that have filled it up.
1155520	1158080	Like guys, I think you can only be on like a hundred different servers.
1158400	1162640	Yeah, I haven't really messed with discord too much, but it seems interesting.
1162640	1163640	Yeah.
1163640	1167400	How do you even with a hundred servers, like who has time for that?
1167400	1171120	Well, I think some of them are more like, like it seems like everybody starts their
1171120	1172120	own server.
1172120	1175720	I think if you're like a Twitch person, all the Twitch people you follow probably have
1175720	1177120	their own servers.
1177120	1183180	Um, I decided to buy in more to the idea of together we are stronger, which is why I throw
1183180	1184180	all my Twitch.
1184300	1189100	Even though I do broadcast on Twitch instead of using my own server, which I started one,
1189100	1192180	but like the only people in it are Alan and I, because I was like, you know what, I'm
1192180	1196560	going to throw my, my w whatever weight this is, it's not much weight, but, uh, behind
1196560	1200720	the VOG server, you know, to try to get more people in one place type of thing.
1200720	1203220	But I know a lot of Twitch streamers will have their own servers.
1203220	1208940	Um, plus a lot of like, I have two for Pokemon go cause I have Pokemon go for the Sacramento
1208940	1213780	area, but then they also have an X-rays server dedicated to the, the, um, you too.
1213780	1218460	I always say Meowth raids with the Mewtwo raids that happened with, um, uh, Pokemon
1218460	1219460	go.
1219460	1220820	So I have two just for that.
1220820	1225900	And then I have like a, when I was playing Warcraft for a hot minute, I was in a Warcraft
1225900	1227500	Guild chat.
1227500	1230220	I was, I'm still in a final fantasy 14.
1230220	1232720	I'm in like two or three final fantasy 14 ones.
1232720	1235020	So it's just that caps out at maybe 15 though.
1235020	1238460	Like I'm talking like you have a hundred, how do you keep up with all of that?
1238460	1239460	It's a lot.
1239460	1240460	So overwhelmed.
1240460	1241460	It is a lot.
1241460	1242460	It's a lot.
1242500	1248540	Live.vognetwork.com dark Tetsuya says, I do have some of the Twitch folks I follow also
1248540	1250180	follow their discords.
1250180	1254460	There's always discussion going on, or they also have image boards or places to share
1254460	1255460	music.
1255460	1256460	Good point.
1256460	1260300	Uh, Rama on the whole Microsoft and discord thing says, no, Microsoft is still working
1260300	1261340	on Skype.
1261340	1265900	They're shutting down Skype for business and merging it into Microsoft teams.
1265900	1273020	It's Slack's competitor, which well, discord is kind of like Slack in a way, but with the
1273020	1275820	team speak element and all that.
1275820	1280100	I wouldn't really say discord is Slack's competitor, even though they're very similar services
1280100	1287540	because Slack is extremely aimed at businesses and Microsoft teams is also going after businesses.
1287540	1290300	Discord is not going for the professional users.
1290300	1291300	Okay.
1291300	1293040	But like, here's, here's the funny thing.
1293080	1301040	So when it comes to Slack, I am in probably 12 different Slacks, 11 of them are ingress
1301040	1302040	related.
1302040	1303040	Oh yeah.
1303040	1304040	Yeah.
1304040	1306520	Like I think ingress got on Slack because Slack was out before discord.
1306520	1309720	I think, I think it's exactly what it is because there's been that talk about should, should
1309720	1311560	we be using discord as an ingress thing?
1311560	1315200	But the problem is now all this customization has been done for Slack.
1315200	1316320	People want to get off of it.
1316320	1321600	Well, I mean, I have both Slack and discord and I like Slack a lot better, but so like,
1321600	1325800	I feel like people who are used to Slack don't want to switch over to discord because
1325800	1329720	they feel very different, but right now I hear that.
1329720	1331900	But Slack also like misses certain features.
1331900	1335160	Make sure you're nice and in that microphone cause you're being very quiet right now.
1335160	1336160	Sorry.
1336160	1341320	Slack is missing specific gaming related features like ignoring people, you know, because it's,
1341320	1343520	Oh, well it's a business tool, right?
1343520	1345920	Which is a whole other argument that we don't need to get into.
1345920	1346920	What?
1346920	1349200	I can't ignore my coworkers?
1349200	1354980	But what's funny to me is that we've never used Slack in my work environments.
1354980	1359960	Now granted, I've historically worked in healthcare and I would imagine using Slack and their
1359960	1364200	servers is probably not good for HIPAA and those types of losses probably why I did Slack
1364200	1365200	is never really.
1365200	1366200	Yep.
1366200	1367200	I don't know.
1367200	1368840	Then maybe they do have the high encryption, but for whatever reason, the companies I've
1368840	1369840	worked for don't use it.
1369840	1374040	We use some type of instant messaging that's in house.
1374040	1378720	Doesn't Salesforce have their own like group message thing cause it's shit.
1379240	1385640	It's Salesforce, so yes, but no, the, my point is like a lot of companies are like, Oh, we're
1385640	1387440	already in on this one thing.
1387440	1388880	We'll just use whatever chat I guess.
1388880	1392280	If you're talking about like chatter, then that is shit.
1392280	1397520	But no, my knowledge of Salesforce is very small, but like for what my company uses for,
1397520	1398520	it's great.
1398520	1404080	But we use, I think we're using like one tiny branch of this huge mungus tree.
1404080	1407960	So and they have so many ways because of my Salesforce, it could be something that we
1407960	1412800	just don't use, which is very, very, very possible.
1412800	1413800	True.
1413800	1418320	Uh, looking at chat over at live.voggenower.com, Tiger cloud points out a great thing about
1418320	1421960	discord is you can use it anywhere since you can use the mobile app.
1421960	1425400	You can even use voice chat on the mobile app, post pics from your phone.
1425400	1431800	I think that is a big part about why discord has succeeded in such a big way too is because
1431800	1432800	of that.
1432800	1435920	You know, like who doesn't have a smartphone in this day and age, right?
1435920	1438080	No, RageNator finally got a smartphone.
1438080	1441940	So I mean like, oh, and Daniel Day Lewis still uses a flip phone.
1441940	1443160	We saw that on social media.
1443160	1444160	Okay.
1444160	1447240	But most like 99% of people have smartphones at this point.
1447240	1452200	So uh, when it comes to the smartphones, like, you know, you, you're gaming on your console.
1452200	1456400	It's very easy to just have your smartphone right there with your little earbud in or
1456400	1457680	just even on speaker or whatever.
1457680	1462480	It's like you have this chat device with you even when Nintendo doesn't have anything.
1462480	1464600	Although those features are not exclusive to discord.
1464600	1468420	Like the Slack app also has, you can upload pictures, you can do voice calls, like all
1468420	1469420	sorts of things.
1469420	1472920	Like I'm not trying to like say one or the other, I'm just saying these are common features.
1472920	1476120	So why do you think the gamers have gravitated towards discord instead of Slack?
1476120	1477120	It's easier to invite people.
1477120	1480720	Slack, you have to have one admin who like has to approve everyone because like in a
1480720	1483160	business environment, you don't just want anyone joining.
1483160	1484160	You know what?
1484160	1489000	That is a damn good point because I can, I don't think there's a problem with me saying
1489000	1490000	this.
1490000	1491860	Uh, if, if there was, I'll hear it from Bobby later.
1491860	1497740	But VOG network looked into getting a Slack, um, before discord was really big.
1497740	1500780	And there were some people that were saying, Oh, you should definitely get VOG on Slack.
1500780	1502100	You could do your chat and all this stuff.
1502100	1506180	And we were kind of looking into it, but the thing that stopped us was what you just said.
1506180	1507180	Yeah.
1507180	1512800	The nice thing about the way the chat is at OLR right now is that you go onto the site,
1512800	1513940	you just click and you're in.
1513940	1517820	But with Slack, somebody would have to invite you and you wouldn't like, you know, that
1517820	1520760	doesn't lend itself well to the instant gratification and that whole thing.
1520760	1525960	The other part is that discord is almost entirely free and Slack is very much aimed
1525960	1529480	at getting you to upgrade to an enterprise solution.
1529480	1535440	So like my Guild Wars Guild uses Slack because of reasons and we are constantly running into,
1535440	1539640	Oh, you can only show like, I think it's 10,000 messages on the free account.
1539640	1540640	Yeah.
1540640	1543280	And that goes by in like, I don't know.
1543280	1544720	It's depending on how busy we are.
1544720	1547160	It's the storage and image thing in Ingress.
1547160	1549600	Go delete all your images.
1549600	1552760	Because everybody's posting like, Oh, here's a field.
1552760	1553760	Here's my badge.
1553760	1554760	I got it.
1554760	1556700	Everybody's posting all their stuff from their cell phone.
1556700	1558880	It fills up the image thing so fucking fast.
1558880	1559880	Right.
1559880	1562080	So like that's the other reason because discord doesn't do that.
1562080	1563340	You can search for it eventually.
1563340	1568000	I think I don't know enough about discord to say, but like they don't like push you
1568000	1573080	at, Oh, you're running out of image space, running out of message space, you should upgrade
1573080	1575420	and each the upgrade is like priced per user.
1575420	1579480	So like any sizable gaming community is not going to do that.
1579480	1583360	Tiger con chat says how long until someone goes into a movie theater, turn on the voice
1583360	1586280	chat and then you hear the movie coming through the voice chat.
1586280	1590040	We wouldn't be able to see the movie that way, but I'm sure, I'm sure there are people
1590040	1591560	that have a Periscope.
1591560	1592560	That was the thing.
1592560	1594800	I don't, I don't, I don't hear much about Periscope anymore.
1594800	1597720	Twitter bought it and then kind of let it die.
1597720	1598720	Just like they didn't rise.
1598720	1600880	Um, you know, just like they did vine.
1600880	1603800	Uh, don't let Twitter buy your company vine coming back.
1603800	1605640	I thought vine was coming back.
1605640	1608660	I think the founder said, gosh, this is terrible.
1608660	1613780	They killed my products and is trying to bring it back, but anyway, but my point with
1613780	1615860	that is that they were doing that with Periscope, right?
1615860	1618540	People were shooting at the movie, uh, the movie.
1618540	1620980	And that's, that's why sometimes the esters will come in and look at the eye because I
1620980	1622220	want to make sure you're not filming the movie.
1622220	1626540	Uh, but then the other big thing was a game of Thrones episodes were going on Periscope,
1626540	1631380	uh, and like the, the big pay-per-view stuff, the Wrestle manias and the MMA is and all
1631380	1633380	that stuff that was, that's huge.
1633380	1634900	Probably still is a problem on Periscope.
1634900	1638420	Honestly, I just, who's, who's uses I, I, you know what?
1638420	1641700	Old Periscope fucking Instagram stories.
1641700	1643140	I thought that was snap.
1643140	1646540	They were killing snapshot with the both.
1646540	1651460	You know, game of Thrones, like speaking of their piracy, like threatened, Oh, we'll pay
1651460	1655660	somebody and we'll just release all of the spoilers like ahead of the season.
1655660	1656660	Huh?
1656660	1658340	That was a thing a couple of weeks ago.
1658340	1659340	I remember that.
1659340	1660340	I remember that.
1660340	1661340	Uh, let's see.
1661340	1664660	Also a tiger class says there's a going around YouTube that I discovered this weekend where
1664660	1668300	they post audio of an audience reacting to infinity war.
1668300	1672300	They don't show video, but rather audio of the audience reacting to certain scenes from
1672300	1673300	the movie.
1673300	1675240	So they aren't playing the entire movie.
1675240	1676580	I've kind of seen that before.
1676580	1677940	They've done that in marketing.
1677940	1680500	Remember the very first paranormal activity?
1680500	1682720	Like I remember the early trailer for that movie.
1682720	1684640	It wasn't even really showing the movie.
1684640	1687420	It was showing the audience's reaction to things in the movie.
1687420	1688780	The movie was lame.
1688780	1689780	Yeah.
1689780	1693140	So, but that was how they sold and pro I want to say Blair witch project, I think did some
1693140	1694140	of that too.
1694140	1696880	Like those, those low budget movies that are super fucking scary.
1696880	1699840	That's kind of how they sell them sometimes is showing the reaction to the movies.
1699840	1702480	Didn't Blair witch project come out before YouTube was founded?
1702480	1703840	Like how did they do reactions?
1703840	1705760	You know, it was in the trailer.
1705760	1706760	Oh, in the trailer.
1706760	1707760	Remember?
1707760	1708760	Oh, got it.
1708760	1709760	Yeah.
1709760	1715100	JD, I know you're a young kid, but back in my day, if you wanted to see a new trailer,
1715100	1716800	you had to go see another movie.
1716800	1721880	I thought you meant they posted a trail, like a separate, like, I think when Blair witch
1721880	1724800	project came out, you had to download a quick time.
1724800	1729920	There was no YouTube, but you could like go to MTV.com and get a quick time or something.
1729920	1730920	Real media.
1730920	1731920	Yes.
1731920	1732920	Real player.
1732920	1733920	Yeah.
1733920	1737120	Or you just had to go on to like watch TV shows and they'd have a trailer from playing
1737120	1742080	an exclusive trailer from Blair witch project after entertainment tonight.
1742080	1743400	They still kind of do that though.
1743400	1744400	Yeah, they do.
1744400	1745400	Yeah.
1745400	1746400	SSJ 100.
1746400	1750400	Matt says used to be the Haven for pay-per-view and didn't that become Twitch?
1750400	1751400	Oh yeah.
1751400	1752400	Justin TV became Twitch.
1752760	1758120	I always thought there's always rumors that Justin's going to come back, but I kind of,
1758120	1760240	I don't think Justin TV is going to come back.
1760240	1762640	I think it's just going to be Twitch is going to get bigger.
1762640	1764080	That's that's what's going to happen.
1764080	1768000	I feel like Justin got his stock options and got very rich and is on an island somewhere.
1768000	1771320	Didn't Justin get let go or am I confusing him with somebody else?
1771320	1772320	I haven't kept up.
1772320	1773320	I know.
1773320	1774320	All right.
1774320	1776880	I won't go into that drama because I'll put my foot in my space.
1776880	1780200	Tom is taking, he's a photographer now.
1780200	1781200	My space.
1781200	1782200	Dude, my space.
1782200	1784600	Tom has to have so much fucking money.
1784600	1788480	Didn't he sell that site when it was still a big deal or did he, did he, was he, was
1788480	1789840	he gone by the time it was in the ground?
1789840	1790840	I have no idea.
1790840	1792640	Did he sell it to Justin Timberlake or something?
1792640	1794120	I have no idea.
1794120	1795120	God.
1795120	1796320	Anyway, uh, let's see.
1796320	1802200	Uh, also in chat at live.vognetwork.com, uh, let's see a dark tissue says, reminds me of
1802200	1806640	the one guy, I think he streamed a UFC thing, but framed it as if he was playing one of
1806640	1807640	the games.
1807640	1808640	Oh yeah.
1808640	1809640	That was a news story a while ago.
1810080	1814320	I was said he was playing UFC, whatever on PlayStation four, but he was actually streaming
1814320	1816800	the live event and clever.
1816800	1819440	It's clever, highly illegal, but clever.
1819440	1820440	My space.
1820440	1824040	Tom's sold my space in 2005 for $580 million.
1824040	1826680	Oh my God.
1826680	1831040	Like, of course he's on a fucking desert island.
1831040	1836040	Just like what, Oh my God, can you imagine $580 million?
1836040	1837240	That's winning the power ball basically.
1837240	1838240	Yeah.
1838840	1839840	Mostly.
1839840	1840840	Mostly.
1843840	1844840	I shouldn't laugh at that.
1844840	1845840	It's horrible.
1845840	1846840	Brad fits.
1846840	1847840	Isn't rolling in it.
1847840	1848840	The, the founder of life.
1848840	1850040	Oh, the founder of live journal.
1850040	1856200	Well, you know, I mean he works at Google now, so he is, but, uh, let's see a rama and
1856200	1860800	chat over at live.vognetwork.com says after being in the social network, Justin Timberlake
1860800	1863480	bought my space from Fox interactive.
1863480	1865280	Oh, that's right.
1865280	1866280	Cause they sold my space.
1866280	1867280	Yeah.
1867320	1868320	Okay.
1868320	1869320	So I mean it was the whole music thing.
1869320	1870320	Yeah.
1870320	1872320	And then they tried to turn my space in the music thing, but I don't think it really worked.
1872320	1875480	I think it's still there, but it's kind of not, it is not what it was.
1875480	1876480	Yeah.
1876480	1877880	It's, it's the source of blackmail photos for everyone.
1877880	1878960	Oh, right.
1878960	1881080	Get in there and delete your my spaces.
1881080	1884480	If you ever had a my space account, I, you better get in there and delete it or those
1884480	1886840	old pictures are going to come back to haunt your ass.
1886840	1890720	Thankfully I never posted anything questionable.
1890720	1895360	Well even like, did you ever post silly things?
1895360	1896360	Nope.
1896440	1897920	Well then that's good for you.
1897920	1901800	I deactivated mine a long time ago, but actually there's a part of me that's kind of sad.
1901800	1905800	Like I wish I would have downloaded a backup first because you know, that's open.
1905800	1908400	Like that was like when everybody was going digital for the first time.
1908400	1912360	So I was like, I've lost this whole series of pictures from a time in my life because
1912360	1914420	I, I nuked my space.
1914420	1919240	So that's why I'm glad not everything is on Facebook, that it's like backed up on my phone
1919240	1922440	and I do back up my phone to my computer once in a while and pull all the pictures down.
1922440	1923800	So that's the nice thing.
1923800	1925800	I don't want to have it all online.
1925800	1926800	All right.
1926800	1931320	Anyway, we have digressed enough from the topic of my space and discord of Microsoft
1931320	1932320	and discord.
1932320	1933320	Does my space have a discord?
1933320	1935600	You think maybe here's the top eight channels.
1935600	1939200	All right, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have
1939200	1940720	been playing this week.
1940720	1942840	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1942840	1944440	It was non-existent.
1944440	1949680	I haven't touched animal crossing in about a week and a half now.
1949680	1953480	I also have only played a little bit of Pokemon.
1953480	1958360	I have only played a little bit of Miitomo because I want to just see it through to
1958360	1960960	its bitter end.
1960960	1968960	And really it's mostly been watching Dan play, uh, you know, go Korok hunting in a Breath
1968960	1970320	of the Wild.
1970320	1973640	And then, yeah, not, not a whole bunch.
1973640	1976620	Just I've got drag con that I'm getting ready for.
1976620	1981320	So that's really been the, uh, the extent of it.
1982040	1983040	Sorry.
1984040	1985040	All good.
1985040	1986040	It happens.
1986040	1988360	Uh, Loki, I'm sure you've had a busy gaming week with the new console.
1988360	1989360	Yeah, I did.
1989360	1993200	I, so now of course, since I got the switch, I've been playing tons of Mario Odyssey.
1993200	1996240	Um, so I haven't gotten that far in the game yet.
1996240	1998760	My son already beat the game, but he's not collecting everything.
1998760	2003440	So I'm up to the Lake Kingdom.
2003440	2011100	I did the tree kingdom and so now just started that and I've got like 72 of the moons already
2011880	2016700	and yeah, I have got Mario Kart 8 as well, but I haven't actually put that into the system
2016700	2020740	yet and I'm looking at probably getting more games for it.
2020740	2022060	I just haven't decided what yet.
2022060	2027780	Minecraft probably, um, and then maybe some more multiplayer stuff.
2027780	2034700	I kept looking at Labo and I kept going over and like, cause I saw it everywhere, you know,
2034700	2040000	this weekend I was like, eh, I picked it up, but all I can think of after looking at my
2040000	2044840	house and how destroyed it is with the kids crap everywhere, that stuff would just be
2044840	2047600	all over the goddamn house and destroyed.
2047600	2052160	So I just, I can't, I cannot buy Labo.
2052160	2058960	It looks neat, but that they're going to get bored with that so quick that it's not worth
2058960	2059960	it.
2059960	2060960	It's just not worth it at all.
2060960	2065600	So I mean as much fun as it would be to make a piano, I think I'd just be bored with it
2065600	2066600	immediately.
2066600	2074200	So not for me, um, but then aside from the Switch stuff, I did play a ton of Pokemon
2074200	2077720	Go just because I've been in a lot of places that had Poke stops and stuff.
2077720	2085200	Um, I think, I think it was kind of ironic that, um, one of the first last like research
2085200	2089800	I had to do was catch three insect type Pokemon and all of a sudden there's no insect type
2089800	2090800	Pokemon anywhere.
2090800	2093040	It's like, it's like Paris a lot.
2093040	2097240	Paris is, I don't know about your neck of the woods, but Paris is herpes around here.
2097240	2099160	It is everywhere and unstoppable.
2099160	2103840	But then when they do a special event, Paris is nowhere to be found.
2103840	2106480	Yeah, it's, it's just, it's, and Venonat is the other one.
2106480	2108680	Venonat is, is everywhere.
2108680	2112000	And then when special event rolls in, it's like all the special stuff takes the Venonat
2112000	2113820	and uh, Paris spawns.
2113820	2117120	It was nice to be able to get some Wailmers cause I hadn't gotten any of those.
2117120	2120080	So I got some of those and I've been catching Magikarp and stuff.
2120120	2125000	I just been just catching as much as I can and just trying to do the daily things.
2125000	2128840	But I've not been like killing myself if I don't get like certain things or whatever.
2128840	2130840	Um, I don't know.
2130840	2131840	It's just a good time killer.
2131840	2135120	Like my kids are at the park today and so I did that cause the park that we're at had
2135120	2136560	like three or four Pokestops.
2136560	2142440	So I just kept walking between them to like, uh, stash up, you know, on the, you know,
2142440	2143440	more items.
2143440	2146880	Did you get to a high enough level in Ingress where you can send more, um, Pokestops?
2146880	2148520	I think it's 10.
2148960	2150640	Yeah, I'm like 13.
2150640	2151640	Oh shoot.
2151640	2152640	Yeah.
2152640	2153640	Then you can also review.
2153640	2154640	I mean, I don't, I'm sure.
2154640	2155640	I did review some.
2155640	2156640	Yeah.
2156640	2157640	Just for fun.
2157640	2158640	I just got bored.
2158640	2159640	Yeah.
2159640	2160640	I hear you.
2160640	2161640	But um, yeah, you can submit too.
2161640	2162640	Why not?
2162640	2163640	Yeah, I guess I could.
2163640	2164640	Um, so I may do that.
2164640	2165640	Who knows?
2165640	2169520	Um, then I was, other than that, I mean, that's pretty much it.
2169520	2173840	It was just mainly just phone games and the switch and now that I have the switch and
2173840	2177840	I'm this close to get in the Skyrim again.
2177840	2180560	I don't want to, I don't want to buy Skyrim again.
2180560	2182560	I'm this close though.
2182560	2183560	It's tempted.
2183560	2186440	They're very tempting, but I may just stick with my PC.
2186440	2189160	I may end up getting on VR though cause that might be fun.
2189160	2195280	Um, I think better than the switch, but yeah, I mean, I've kind of like looked at the stuff
2195280	2196280	online.
2196280	2199160	Um, some of the games are looking at like golf story might be really good.
2199160	2202160	I hear that's a pretty fun RPG, so I may try that.
2202160	2205280	Um, blaster masters looks pretty awesome.
2205800	2207880	Oh, definitely get blast master.
2207880	2208880	That's a good deal.
2208880	2209880	So I may do that.
2209880	2214080	Um, but like, it's kind of like, I've been hard trying to figure out what I want to purchase
2214080	2218720	on the switch and like even like the Nintendo stuff, it's like, eh, I don't really want
2218720	2219720	that.
2219720	2221960	I mean, I'm, I guess I'll have to wait until E3 this year to see what else they're going
2221960	2222960	to come out with.
2222960	2227000	I hope they bring back Mario maker cause that's one I am really sad that I had to let go of
2227000	2232560	because of this, but in the end of the thing I told my son too, cause I backed the ball
2232560	2234360	with the saves before that.
2234360	2239560	My PC runs a fucking Wii U emulator like a bomb, so I don't, it's not a big deal that
2239560	2244800	we're losing some of those Wii U games, so I'll just play it on there.
2244800	2248120	I think Mario maker would be a good one to come back to, but they did put it on 3DS that
2248120	2249480	might've been there.
2249480	2250480	I know, I know.
2250480	2251480	It's not the same thing.
2251480	2252480	It's not the same thing.
2252480	2253480	It's not.
2253480	2255880	And they like took out something really add anything so I can see them bringing it back
2255880	2260640	as like a remaster of a game and maybe putting another Mario set in there.
2260640	2264020	Maybe they do Mario two level Mario two game boy.
2264020	2268240	Mario two played so different from the other Mario's because it wasn't originally a Mario
2268240	2269240	game.
2269240	2271040	So maybe Mario land.
2271040	2277720	Well I would say another graphic skin they could do easy would be Mario all stars.
2277720	2278720	That was missing.
2278720	2282040	I think Mario all stars would be like an extra bonus skin they could put in there and that
2282040	2283040	would work really well.
2283040	2285920	Did they add any Odyssey stuff in yet?
2285920	2288520	But Odyssey is 3D so it doesn't really work.
2289400	2294880	Well I don't think they would do it, but we need for a 3D Mario maker do Odyssey Galaxy
2294880	2295880	64.
2295880	2296880	Sunshine.
2296880	2301120	I would be that might be a bit much but yeah I mean I'd be for it if they if Nintendo can
2301120	2302120	pull it off in a Nintendo way.
2302120	2304640	I mean someone's pulled it off on an emulator for the 64.
2304640	2310640	I think a Mario maker with the bonus all stars skin would be a smart thing to do.
2310640	2314520	Mario two like again I'm all for it like in theory it would be awesome and if Nintendo
2314520	2317200	can kind of figure out how to incorporate that Mario maker but I almost feel like that
2317200	2321600	would have to be a separate thing because Mario two is not the same game as the others.
2321600	2322600	Or just bring some.
2322600	2328600	Although it would be sorry it would be badass if you could like I do think about NES remix
2328600	2332860	like you know those games and it had these random ass stages where you could play as
2332860	2336560	the princess in Super Mario Brothers 3.
2336560	2338080	Like that was some of the weird shit it did.
2338080	2342160	So actually it would be really rad and I think would justify a re-release of Mario maker
2342160	2347920	if they did a Super Mario maker with Mario two Mario all stars and you can play as Luigi
2347920	2350760	Toad and Princess.
2350760	2351760	That would be right.
2351760	2352760	Wouldn't that be awesome.
2352760	2356240	But and then people would really have to think about some of the levels and the fact that
2356240	2359940	you know Toad and Princess and Luigi and some of the things they could do would be different.
2359940	2360940	So I don't know.
2360940	2362240	There's a lot to do with it.
2362240	2363680	Yeah there's a lot you could do with it.
2363680	2367080	So OK J.D. how was your gaming week.
2367080	2368080	It was good.
2368080	2369080	Yeah.
2369080	2371160	I've been also playing Odyssey.
2371200	2373000	I've beaten the game already.
2373000	2376760	So but they put in a lot of updates recently.
2376760	2380080	Like they introduced I mean this is in the past couple of months but I haven't really
2380080	2382080	picked it up until now.
2382080	2392000	They put in a Luigi balloon mode where it's hide and seek with balloons and that's been
2392000	2394160	a lot of fun.
2394160	2400900	And it's a huge coin maker like I will never need to grind for coins again with this mode.
2400900	2404540	So they put in a bunch of new costumes to buy.
2404540	2411540	So I've been playing dress up and I finally went through the stupid volleyball moon where
2411540	2414940	you have to like hit it a hundred times.
2414940	2420940	I've also been playing Splatoon within the single player mode mostly Splatoon 2.
2420940	2421940	Splatoon 2.
2421940	2422940	Yeah.
2422940	2423940	Sorry I don't have the first one.
2423940	2424940	Yeah.
2424940	2428540	The single player mode has like a bunch of collectibles so that's what I've been doing.
2428540	2434140	And they recently like in the past week put Callie in if you've beaten the game.
2434140	2437160	So I wanted to see what that was about.
2437160	2441900	I've also been buying a bunch of 3DS games when they go on sale on my Nintendo.
2441900	2447320	It's like 30% off and you know it's a digital copy so I'm on board with that.
2447320	2453660	So I've recently gone most of the way through Paper Mario Sticker Star which I have feelings
2453660	2456660	about.
2456660	2457660	And then.
2457660	2460260	Just wait a minute elaborate on this please.
2460260	2466260	I mean the Paper Mario series is pretty inconsistent like it's the first two games were fantastic
2466260	2470740	and then the Wii one was a bit of a departure and I feel like it's kind of deteriorated
2470740	2471740	from there.
2471740	2472740	I love the Wii one.
2472740	2475480	I mean that's the only one I played so I don't know.
2475480	2479640	It's different like the first two are much more like standard RPGs and the Wii one was
2479640	2482820	like a hybrid platformer RPG.
2482820	2489640	And then Sticker Star like is just a like it's kind of a weird like run around adventure
2489640	2490780	kind of a thing.
2490780	2496160	And the thing that really bothers me the most is that you in order to attack you have to
2496160	2502460	use stickers which are consumable and I'm the kind of gamer who hoards everything because
2502460	2504700	I might need it someday.
2504700	2509780	And I have all these I have hundreds of potions in Skyrim and I may need them at some point.
2509780	2510780	Right.
2510780	2515620	The inventory management was really difficult because you can only hold so many and then
2515620	2521360	it's like well OK I might need this because I only have so many jumps but there's this
2521360	2524980	really big one that's powerful that I want to hang on to because I just found it and
2524980	2527700	if I don't make room for it I'll lose it.
2527700	2531060	But then I have to get rid of the attacks that I'm using because you can't do anything
2531060	2536860	without a sticker like that whole mechanic really did not work for me.
2536860	2541220	And then I've been playing Animal Crossing Pocket Camp and Pokemon Go.
2541220	2547740	Animal Crossing they put in loot boxes that are cutesy fortune cookies and like literally
2547740	2552620	everybody I've read anything about like on Reddit or whatever is upset about it because
2552620	2559060	they cost a pretty significant amount of real world money to get for the most part and you're
2559060	2560940	not guaranteed uniques.
2560940	2566740	So like I think the stats someone posted said if you were to buy enough fortune cookies
2566740	2571740	to get one of each item if you had perfect luck it would be like $20.
2571740	2575380	Wait the only person I always defer to Jamie when it comes to Animal Crossing is this kind
2575380	2576380	of why I stopped playing.
2576380	2577380	Oh yeah.
2577380	2579340	Oh so this you are not you're not a fan of this either.
2579340	2580340	No.
2580340	2582620	So it has taken the fun out of it for me.
2582620	2583620	Yikes.
2583620	2584620	Yikes Nintendo.
2584620	2588940	A lot of Animal Crossing players like to complete the catalog because that's you know all the
2588940	2594220	items you know it's fashion it's whatever and fortune cookie items the paid ones or
2594220	2599440	I mean you can do it with in game currency sort of a little bit but not like all of it.
2599440	2601420	Those also go in the same catalog.
2601420	2606760	So it's like well you have to either be OK with an incomplete list of everything or pay
2606760	2611660	real world money and it's gambling because you don't know are you going to get the rare
2611660	2616340	or are you going to get the stupid two star item that you've got four times already.
2616340	2620420	Yeah there's there's a lot of content that they put in that's been locked behind.
2620420	2622980	Not only is it paid but it's limited time.
2622980	2627660	Like they put in a fortune cookie that's like here's a bunch of game consoles that
2627660	2630380	you can get for your house or for your campsite.
2630380	2633140	But this is only here for two weeks.
2633140	2635900	Like it's it's yeah it's frustrating.
2635900	2636900	OK.
2636900	2638980	All right.
2638980	2643300	Well we're going to move on to me and my gaming week.
2643300	2647100	My gaming week was kind of a potpourri of a lot of different type of stuff.
2647100	2651420	I've randomly got back into Diablo 3 it's like Diablo is one of those it's one of those
2651420	2652420	old flings.
2652420	2657140	You just kind of end up going back to once in a while and they ever going to bring that
2657140	2661380	to the switch because you know those are those rumors I know we talked we talked about previously
2661380	2665780	I'll be a very interesting sort of like the most land Diablo experience would be if they
2665780	2668900	brought it to switch and everybody could play Diablo on their own screens or gauntlet.
2668900	2674260	I'll play gauntlet on multiplayer like gauntlet would be a lot more possible because they
2674260	2678060	did have that gauntlet remake a couple of years ago that was on PlayStation 4 and Steam
2678060	2679060	and all that.
2679060	2681940	So there's no reason they couldn't put that on switch if they wanted to.
2681980	2686180	I don't know if they're still you know supporting gauntlet but anyway.
2686180	2693620	So I was playing I was playing that and kind of got sucked back into the season play season
2693620	2697300	13 right now so I've been working on that I'm almost to level 70 I have a little more
2697300	2698300	ways to go.
2698300	2700500	So I've been doing that on PC.
2700500	2704020	Also been playing Overwatch continuing to do that especially since they still have that
2704020	2705260	special event going on.
2705260	2709940	I still have yet to get a skin for that oh wait no I take it back I got a Reinhardt skin
2709940	2714340	great a character I never pick in a quick play I got a skin for them oh well.
2714340	2720620	All I wanted was the Kris Jenner Sombra skin that's all I wanted and instead you got Alexis
2720620	2723020	Michelle basically.
2723020	2729300	So anyway I've been playing a little bit of Overwatch and I've actually not been playing
2729300	2733020	as much Final Fantasy 14 lately I'm kind of waiting for the next content patch and that
2733020	2736900	I'll log in to keep my house and my account active but that's about it.
2736900	2740460	And then randomly I was on Xbox One playing some stuff on there so I talked about Gianna
2740460	2743820	Sisters earlier and since you were visiting this weekend I was like let's look at some
2743820	2748540	of the backwards compatible stuff you had never seen Beaten Groovy before and I was
2748540	2753540	like let me show you how Konami shot themselves in the foot when they tried to launch Papa
2753540	2758020	Music here in the US and so we played Beaten Groovy which I still to this day I don't know
2758020	2763460	why anybody wasted a second of time trying to make that game backwards compatible I mean
2763460	2768260	I guess making something else backwards compatible made that backwards compatible so I was like
2768260	2773580	hey bonus but that game is a waste of everything so but I had to show you what an abomination
2773580	2776860	was so we got to see that that was fun right you know they have a popin music game on the
2776860	2782500	Wii too I know I never played it yeah I didn't either is it yeah I was like is it interesting
2782500	2788580	I tell you what my Wii is homebrew enabled so I might at some point when I'm bored just
2788580	2795900	like download it and try it there you go and then um let's see uh also I've still been
2795900	2801620	playing Minecraft what the heck I'm still playing Minecraft I um I was playing a little
2801620	2807420	bit more on that so after last you need to tell me when after last week's show we went
2807420	2812540	on to twitch and I did a world called Miss Vanjie that but it was like spelled in all
2812540	2816040	caps this time so I got a different world and we're actually doing a little bit of multiplayer
2816040	2820640	and I still kind of went on in that world but I got really frustrated that I could not for the
2820640	2826280	life of me find any iron like just freaking iron I was like not finding so finally I decided to
2826280	2832480	give up on Miss Vanjie and on the I think it was Thursday night I rolled a new world because I
2832480	2836520	wanted to see what it looked like if you let the chest and the village start in the game because I
2836520	2842520	hadn't seen any of that so I started a new world called proportion izing it was my seed do you like
2842560	2847000	that I like that one I did and some some of you out there will get the reference some work but
2847000	2853280	some won't but I started a new world called proportion izing and it's actually probably my
2853280	2859600	favorite seed I've done yet so there is that it's all in lowercase proportion izing and I was able
2859600	2863080	to quickly build a little shelter in the side of the mountain and then there's a little village
2863080	2867600	that's like right there and so I kind of got to see that village mechanic but damn they want a lot
2867600	2871960	of shit to give you an emerald oh my god they weren't like the one guy wants like 25 pieces
2871960	2876280	of paper for one emerald and I'm like where's sugar cane around here it's fine emeralds yeah
2876280	2882640	where do you find it Oh emeralds are in the care in their abandoned mine shafts do you yell Eureka
2882640	2892480	when you find something I do I do and and there are is plenty of iron that was the I started not
2892480	2897840	far from this gigantic cave entrance and it was like one of those were like the underground was
2897880	2902320	already like really opened up and there's all these places to go in the underground and so
2902320	2906800	I was finding hella iron in there so I was able to make myself a full suit of armor pretty quick
2906800	2910920	so yeah I was pretty happy with that anyway minecraft minecraft minecraft but like I'm
2910920	2916480	actually into minecraft but I'm gonna kind of dial it back a bit because I'm waiting for mr.
2916480	2923880	black wolf to be available again so we can start our official vog realm so we can invite switch
2923880	2931440	players Xbox players and PC players to all play together on the vog realm which we will see what
2931440	2938080	drag race word of the will be available technically Android and iOS players oh yeah Android iOS
2938080	2943960	players so yeah everybody will be able to play on that realm so I'll be fun as 200 Matt says I need
2943960	2947840	to get back into minecraft yeah it's fun it's fun but I'm having a hard time kind of breaking like
2947840	2951680	past that first phase of the game when you're collecting iron when you start have to like
2951680	2956240	really start collecting the other stuff for like redstone like you know you need redstone to be able
2956240	2959960	to make a compass and all that other stuff you know when you can kind of really start to go into
2959960	2965440	the next phase of the game but yeah just dig on down I know you gotta keep keep digging down keep
2965440	2970040	digging how do you know you've hit the bottom in minecraft do you hit is it all lava at the bottom
2970040	2976000	it's bedrock you won't be able to go any further okay okay and you see like this like weird black
2976000	2982040	fog type stuff oh interesting okay well I'll so I have yet to hit absolute rock bottom it's like
2982040	2989760	I don't remember like the exact depth I know like I remember his many down as it is up it's like 64
2989760	2997640	down and 64 oh it's more than that is there than 128 down 128 up maybe yeah it's got to be some
2997640	3003440	power of two otherwise you're talking 256 down that's that's I think it might be 256 is it really
3003440	3007960	I don't know I can look it up I'm sure it's on the way you've done that thing where you find the
3007960	3013640	edge of the world and everything goes crazy I play on the worlds that keep like they go forever
3013640	3019000	yeah that you can't find the edge ever I just remember that being a thing once yeah I know
3019000	3023440	well especially because I guess they split so now you just have minecraft which are all the
3023440	3027800	connected versions are just minecraft you have minecraft PlayStation 4 Edition because it's not
3027800	3033720	connected to the others you have minecraft Java Edition which is the old-school minecraft where
3033720	3038120	you still have to like craft everything by hand and stuff and that has probably what you're talking
3038120	3044120	about yeah yeah so but I like I like Windows 10 minecraft a lot and I'm really excited for when
3044120	3049320	they do the super duper graphics 4k thing that's gonna be I know 4k minecraft I'm so excited but
3049320	3052560	the weather effects are what I'm really looking forward to I think they'll look really cool yeah
3052560	3058520	all right anyway that's enough for my gaming week so I'm gonna quickly say that you can follow us on
3058520	3064080	Twitter at twitter.com slash olr we're also on Facebook at orange lounge radio and that's really
3064080	3069680	all I have to announce tonight not a lot of announcements we I'm considering taking the
3069680	3075000	show off when she goes to drag con so that's gonna be in two weeks but I'll have a final call on that
3075000	3079400	next week because it looks like I'm gonna be in San Francisco that weekend hanging with JD because
3079400	3083960	that's Eurovision weekend apparently is the same weekend is so I may just end up staying in San
3083960	3091000	Francisco so later the total height of the map is 256 okay so 128 up 128 but the highest they
3091000	3096800	basically the way they say is the highest sea level or sea water levels give me 62 so you think
3096800	3104280	it's not quite even it's not even so like you're probably looking at 180 something down got it okay
3104280	3110360	I see so it's not it's not evil and they have four layers of bedrock too so okay got it why
3110360	3115480	do they have four layers of bedrock if because it's a seed and so it's just kind of scattered
3115480	3123080	around so you don't fall through it okay interesting okay all right well we're going to
3123080	3129080	move on to some news and the news this week and of course again if you're listening live you can
3129080	3134880	always join us at live.vognetwork.com I want to say I was looking at chat cuz there's a really
3134880	3138400	funny comment I read earlier that I wanted to read oh here it is I I missed this comment earlier I
3138400	3144380	want to read it now MXC in our chat room said my gaming week was non-existent because Rob named
3144380	3151600	drop the soap opera passions last week so my time was spent binging that goddamn show you're welcome
3151600	3157080	and tell me tell me you don't love Tabitha and Timmy but try not to be sad because Timmy actually
3157080	3162680	like passed away halfway through the making of that show and I think they replaced Timmy with a
3162680	3167840	female doll at some point I don't remember I need to go back and binge the show myself to remember
3167840	3178920	so or to quote the wonderful show dinosaurs uh-huh we're gonna need new Timmy all right news let's
3178920	3184920	get into some gaming news Loki all right so Nintendo is getting a new president so basically
3185760	3195960	the previous president which was Tatsumi can we have Nintendo influence America I couldn't resist
3195960	3202840	sorry please continue Tatsumi Kimishima it basically is gonna step down and replacing them
3202840	3212640	is gonna be Shintaro Furukawa and I guess he joined the company in 1994 where he was he's
3212640	3219120	been an outside director of the Pokemon company since 2012 and then a managing executive officer
3219120	3224800	and then supervisor of corporate analysis and administration division and director of Nintendo
3224800	3234200	since 2016 so doesn't really say anything's gonna really change from that but I guess well they're
3234200	3238240	not gonna okay they're not gonna be like we changed our president and the whole get a hold
3238240	3242400	on your butts because everything is gonna fucking change not everything's gonna change I know like
3242720	3248880	when we had like our company had president changes or CEO changes you know that basically it's not
3248880	3253080	necessarily the direction but like kind of their focus may have changed like they might be one in
3253080	3259320	the focus more on like one aspect of the company or one direction versus another so you may have
3259320	3266400	like a difference in like kind of where they want to use where they want the company to go and well
3266400	3271080	what's also interesting is that this this new president what was his name again I'm it's gonna
3271080	3275520	take some getting used to free kumashima oh kimishim is that no kimishim is the no it's a
3275520	3282400	Furukawa Furukawa yeah Furukawa is the new president he's only like 45 years old right
3282400	3289120	yeah it's 46 years old 46 years old okay so he's seven years older than me so he grew up on the
3289120	3293680	Nintendo he grew up in a world where Nintendo was already I couldn't think of a more perfect person
3293680	3301040	for that yeah right um and well I mean what I'm assuming is by going with somebody who is a little
3301040	3306360	more younger you know not that I am for age discrimination but when a wada took over Nintendo
3306360	3311120	he was a younger guy too if I remember right and he really became kind of the face of Nintendo I
3311120	3316000	mean obviously you know Miyamoto just you know I would hope with like someone that is a bit younger
3316000	3319800	like that would be a little bit more tech savvy and so we don't have any of these scenarios where
3319800	3326200	it's like we don't know what Xbox Live is like and so you know like I think they have like this
3326200	3330320	is years ago that we talked about this like where they didn't even it seemed like they didn't know
3330320	3335440	what their competition was doing in the realm of like network at least he doesn't look as scary as
3335440	3340560	Yamauchi did cuz I always thought that he looked like he was former Yakuza or something I know
3340560	3344480	every time we would watch like Dan and I would watch a Nintendo documentary we would just say
3344480	3350560	it's Yamauchi of the Yamauchi gumi hmm so well and I think a lot of people are wondering like did
3350560	3357400	did Kimishima do something wrong or was were they unhappy with him he wants a younger guy well I
3357640	3361960	think that was what he said right well it's part that but I think the other thing to remember is
3361960	3367200	that I do recall when they put Kimishima and they were like this is this was always temporary yeah
3367200	3373160	and basically you know it wasn't that he wasn't doing well it was just basically said that Kimishima
3373160	3378240	thought that Nintendo's management needed to be younger to better understand its customers thank
3378240	3383440	you thank you well in Kimishima I mean you know here's the thing I'm not gonna knock him at all
3383440	3389720	because he he did exactly what he needed to do he carried out a wata's vision he was a financial
3389720	3394240	guy and you can say that you can certainly say Nintendo is in a great fucking place financially
3394240	3399600	now the switch has done very well you know and all this stuff so I know Kimishima has done what
3399600	3405920	he went there to do so I think he's been the guy that kind of his role was to fully carry out what
3405920	3412120	a wata was working on now you're gonna have this new guy come in that's gonna be okay what's the
3412120	3417160	next Nintendo system what's the next direction for Nintendo and I think that's what this new
3417160	3421840	guy is gonna be coming in to do in part not to say that Nintendo probably doesn't already have
3421840	3427200	a plan in place for the next few years and maybe even has an idea of what their next system is but
3427200	3431840	I think this is going to be the guy that then carries that next system out and I think it's
3431840	3436480	probably gonna be more of a face of the company like Kimishima he never showed up in Nintendo
3436480	3442520	Directs no he didn't do any of the the shows or anything they always sent Reggie to any of the
3442520	3447120	American talk shows maybe Miyamoto with his that infamous thumbs up thumbs down thing from the
3447120	3451360	Tonight Show and all that but for the most part you know those are the guys making all the public
3451360	3457680	appearances so I'm imagining because this guy is younger he and maybe just his attitude I mean we
3457680	3462480	haven't really seen this guy yet maybe he is going to be more of the guy you're gonna see and be like
3462480	3467760	that face of Nintendo now and that I'm assuming that's kind of why they're doing this transition
3467760	3474720	now so my assumption is that e3 is going to be this guy's big unveiling he you because the
3474720	3479680	transition doesn't happen till the end of May right it doesn't actually become effective till
3479680	3486080	then or mid-may or something that probably yeah so e3 is going to be the official unveiling of
3486080	3489920	this new CEO and that's when you're gonna really get to meet him and know his personality I think
3489920	3494440	a little bit in the Nintendo Direct at least that's my said summer so I don't know okay when
3494440	3501040	that's one they're determining summer is gonna be okay all right fair enough fair enough so yeah so
3501040	3505400	again I it's kind of one of those things where it's like oh shoot Nintendo got a new president
3505400	3510040	like I wasn't expecting that but it's like oh wait a minute but you know Kimishima was supposed
3510040	3514920	to be a temporary guy he wasn't you know he was only gonna be there to really finish off what a
3514920	3519280	wata had started and and now we're starting to see really okay now what is the future
3519280	3527040	Nintendo look like so very interested to see what this guy does no pressure right right maybe hope
3527040	3533160	a virtual console on maybe you maybe he will if he you know what if he grew up on Famicom games
3533160	3538920	then maybe he's gonna say I want to play those games again we need to figure out a way to make
3538920	3542840	those games back out there I wouldn't be surprised if he had gaming watches when he was a kid you
3542840	3547400	know for the market they were intended for course of course now is the right type of nostalgia to
3547400	3554200	cash in on well and and is it going to be another classic NES I mean because there's no reason why
3554200	3559280	Nintendo could not wouldn't do like a classic NES too and it could take you know what they could
3559280	3564920	absolutely do a classic NES too and it's shaped like the new Nintendo's that hardly anybody had
3564920	3569440	the top loaders you know what I mean so there's no reason they couldn't do another one of those
3569440	3574720	I still wanted to get one of the Famicom style ones oh one of the classic Famicoms yeah except
3574720	3578760	the thing that I always hated about the Famicom is that the controllers are attached and really
3578760	3585680	short hmm all right well let's move on to other Microsoft news and Jason alluded to this in the
3585680	3592240	intro and I find this very fascinating there's a new April Xbox update and it started coming out
3592240	3596480	you're starting to see that on the Xbox one and there's a lot of new stuff with it including
3596480	3601280	advanced video modes that will allow you to smooth out displays club and community tournament
3601280	3606840	improvements and this is pretty big deal you can share your controller with one of your viewers on
3606840	3613160	mixer so whereas the PlayStation has share play which is more of a private thing right you kind
3613160	3616880	of streamed one of your friends and they can take your controller mixer is gonna allow you to do
3616880	3622200	this with your viewers you know and mixer again if you didn't already know is Microsoft's kind of
3622200	3627880	competitor for twitch and it's interesting to see you know they're really trying to think of some
3627880	3632600	different ideas than which twitch is provided so this is this is very different and I think you
3632600	3637120	would crack the joke before the show before we went online you could give your controller over
3637120	3641240	to somebody on mixer and then that person could go in and delete all your save files I don't think
3641240	3645400	that's gonna be how it works I know well you and I imagine you can take the controller back in a
3645400	3651720	heartbeat if if somebody's fucking around or whatever with this will be low latency mode so
3651720	3656800	if the TV has a low latency or game mode your Xbox is gonna be able to communicate you're playing a
3656800	3662640	game to the device and switch the mode automatically so it's gonna tell your TV to switch future is now
3662640	3671840	that's right also adding support for 2560 by 1440 that's kind of neat to variable refresh rate start
3671840	3676920	the mixer broadcast anywhere on Xbox one and a pause animation if you switch games or go to the
3676920	3682080	dashboard you can share screenshots directly to Twitter now which I think PlayStation 4 is let
3682080	3686040	you've done that do that for a while but Xbox will have you do that light and dark themes for
3686040	3691040	everybody a high contrast theme probably for those that need a little help with the site things
3691040	3697240	improvements to Xbox narrator again great accessibility changes their balance in game
3697240	3703280	audio and streamed music spatial audio on the Xbox one dashboard an updated edge browser woohoo
3703280	3708720	anyone can create community tournaments new filters to club feeds club admins can filter
3708720	3714240	invitation requests and experimental new features oh I like a system that experiments but that's
3714240	3718840	everything to look forward to in the April update so what do you guys think controller sharing on
3718840	3724000	mixer is this a good thing or is this a waste of time on Microsoft to put this in I think it's a
3724000	3727760	waste of time I just don't know yet how that's gonna be utilized and I guess we'll have to see
3727760	3732840	when people are streaming how they utilize that hey play my game while I pee yeah play my game
3732840	3738280	while I pee pretty much I wonder if they're gonna try to do like twitch plays Pokemon style stuff
3738280	3743400	like because mixer is their streaming thing and like twitch plays Pokemon was probably one of the
3743400	3748200	first times I heard twitch being like a big name so maybe they're trying to go for something like
3748440	3755440	plays pub G can you imagine a thing though we're like mixer plays Pokemon well yeah it'll probably
3755440	3760600	be a Microsoft game but racer plays halo or something where each person can control for
3760600	3767080	one second yeah I mean like maybe that's the kind of like creative stuff they're trying to win you
3767080	3772600	know get on board with who knows guys you don't chat says PlayStation 4 been doing share play out
3772600	3777560	the box I don't think that was out the box the streaming was out of the box on the PlayStation
3777560	3781440	4 but I don't think share play came in till later yeah that wasn't until later where you
3781440	3786000	could share your controller with somebody else I didn't come in till later but but the difference
3786000	3792560	here is on PlayStation 4 it's private on mixer it's gonna be public right I think it's for
3792560	3797000	different intents so I don't know if it's gonna be the same right yeah just let me like hey you
3797000	3801240	want to try this game or want play co-op with me but you could and share please share please
3801240	3807000	though it's not so that's why I'm kind of confused on this so like is this where like I can start a
3807000	3811280	game say of halo death match or something like that and I could have three other people join
3811280	3815640	like to play local play type thing like they're like remotely controlling player two three and
3815640	3820360	four or is this gonna be like hey I'm playing halo you take over the controls for me and I'm
3820360	3825600	like hands off and I'm just gonna commentate on you playing this or something either or would be
3825600	3830260	if it's like share play it would be either or so but the other thing would be that they'd have to
3830260	3835080	kind of have the load that they'd have to have really good latency but I think mixer already
3835080	3841360	has like super low latency because mixer is kind of the way twitch used to be before twitch got
3841360	3845560	really big remember how like it was almost instantaneous on twitch previously and now
3845560	3850920	there's like what a 25 second delay or something on twitch whereas on mixer I think it's much lower
3850920	3855360	so maybe you know cuz it isn't gonna be hard to play a platforming game or something if it's not
3855360	3860920	like instantaneous the nice thing about share play is it does feel really good like it's not like I
3860920	3865720	wouldn't play a music game or anything on it but playing like other like playing like monster
3865720	3870880	hunter or something like you it does feel normal like you're playing a normal game instantaneous
3870880	3875160	you're gonna have people stream sniping these guys but I mean well I don't think you're just gonna be
3875160	3878920	able to like you're gonna have to give permission for somebody to take controls well right what I'm
3878920	3884520	saying is though is if it's instantaneous in order for it to be able to handle something like this
3884520	3889680	people are gonna be able to watch people play PUBG yeah and they can stream snipe them because
3889720	3894480	there's no delay well you could do that now anyway no you can't because there's a delay in playing
3894480	3898520	the game there's like a 25 second delay you said no mixer doesn't have that delay and the mixers
3898520	3904200	never had that delay oh it's it's much shorter but it's gonna have to get even shorter you know
3904200	3910560	I mean right anyway I'm excited to see what this is and I like that mixer is doing these sorts of
3910560	3915520	things to really try to differentiate themselves from twitch like it does kind of make me go I
3916020	3922360	should be doing stuff more stuff with mixer but then I go but twitch will pay me so or at least I
3922360	3928000	there is a money-making mechanism through twitch right now so you know there is there is that to
3928000	3932760	consider and and I think if mixer could kind of figure that all out like I know you can become a
3932760	3939920	mixer partner and stuff but you know it's it's not they need that more entry-level type of program I
3939920	3946320	think to really have that take off it'll come in and if it doesn't then if this is popular then
3946320	3951600	twitch will just copy it but twitch hasn't been copying what make sure does I would have thought
3951600	3957520	for sure twitch would have jacked the multi stream thing by now but they haven't this is interesting
3957520	3964000	all right maybe it's because in a lot of streams on mixer it's very messy and that's because you
3964000	3968040	can do a multi stream of four people but the problem is all four people keep talking over
3968040	3973560	each other like these people need to use like a unified chat environment or something where it
3973560	3977840	would make the streams a lot cleaner if they did that's how they do it with awesome games done
3977840	3983160	quick it's basically just you have audio from one whoever's in the lead that's the audio you hear
3983160	3989680	yeah however they rotate it around yeah looking in chat at live dog network comms Kaijuto says
3989680	3995720	twitch probably can't do it because they don't have the tech they're related to Amazon now don't
3995720	4000640	forget they've got they've got plenty of tech let's see blueberry and chat says can Xbox now
4000640	4007400	play local co-op online or only with gold oh that's a good question about would gold people
4007400	4013120	only be able to use the mixer control we don't know that do we know if that's only available to
4013120	4017720	gold or not good question because share play on PlayStation 4 you have to have PlayStation
4017720	4022000	Plus to take the controller you don't have to have PlayStation Plus to watch but you have to
4022000	4025920	have PlayStation Plus to take the controller so that's a very good question and I'm not sure one
4025920	4031440	that has been answered yet so all right well let's move on with some other stories dark soccer what
4031440	4037880	do you have for us oh in other news there are well you know hackers gonna hack and data miners
4037880	4045800	gonna data mine so there are some new Super Mario Odyssey costumes coming out they the names were
4045800	4051120	data mined in February but now the designs are released so we have a zombie outfit that's got
4051120	4058000	Mario all green and happy and torn to bits with an axe in his head that's charming there's also I
4058000	4067640	guess a looks like a 17th century or 18th century French nobleman outfit complete with wig there's
4067640	4073040	an astronaut no maybe a racer it looks kind of like a race car driver yeah there's a Santa
4073040	4079920	there's a weird Viking looking one I guess it's definitely race because it says Mario
4079920	4088160	Motors on him there's also a little dress and dude I guess these are the Bowser marriage
4088160	4095640	these are the brutal the brutal yeah yeah one of those has been officially released like there is
4095640	4099800	a news piss on the switch channel and everything that's not the one that's in this picture though
4099800	4107600	that's the one of the green one with a hat yeah this is like a pretty dress and a weird-looking
4107600	4118480	courier typer or courtier type person and another one is a dude in a sombrero so that's all of the
4118480	4126400	brutal that's cool if you like collecting the outfits I'm sure that Nintendo is just gonna
4126400	4130520	gradually roll those out because they've been doing that for the past like a couple of months
4130520	4135240	it just it keeps Odyssey kind of fresh in people's mind the zombie one is a little surprising I
4135240	4138760	wouldn't be surprised if these are tied with holidays because you have the zombie one that
4138760	4143840	could be Halloween you have one that looks like George Washington Independence Day and Santa
4143840	4153160	Claus obviously that's gonna be st. Patrick's Day I mean so what about Hanukkah Mario Rob you know
4153160	4159440	they always ignore us for any holidays I know but there's like maybe five Jews in Japan maybe
4159440	4164000	toad is the Jewish one maybe maybe they're not there actually is a very large Jewish community
4164000	4169920	in Japan oh I didn't because even though they were allied with the Nazis during World War two they
4169920	4177400	did open their borders to Jewish refugees interesting history lesson there you go more than a bargain
4177400	4183520	for on oil art but no it's pretty much just all of the commercial holidays okay fair enough
4183520	4189360	race day I love race day I mean that's probably a Mario Kart tie-in they've been doing like the
4189360	4196760	Satellaview costume and like other Nintendo wait which one's the dress oh okay yeah yeah the girl
4196760	4202840	brutal yeah there's three names so for Mario's quinceañera I think the wedding dress would work
4202840	4208920	for the quinceañera actually yeah it's honestly honestly like I I'm like when I hear these Mario
4208920	4213840	costume stories I'm like okay cool me I'm never gonna change out of the wedding dress like the
4213840	4217320	Mario on the wedding dress is the only way I can play Mario Odyssey because it's just it lends
4217320	4221960	itself to non-stop amazing screenshots I like playing with different hats and the wedding
4221960	4227280	dress because like the juxtaposition is crazy what you like to have a say-something hat I mean
4227280	4234160	you know that I've seen it I like I like going into the 8-bit Mario whenever you go into those
4234160	4239600	sections and seeing what the costume looks like mm-hmm that's always fun um for real though like
4239600	4243800	I thought I was always gonna play with the wedding dress but then they released the sunshine outfit
4243800	4249600	and I was like this is my aesthetic we're good okay fair enough all right I go to a chat over at
4249600	4256440	live dot vog and network comm Raginator in chat says costumes as DLC and Mario Odyssey reminds
4256440	4261120	me of little big planet on PlayStation 3 another game that had tons and tons of costumes were they
4261120	4265440	it some you had to pay for some you didn't you would unlock as you play different levels it's
4265440	4269760	kind of a mix-and-match there especially if it was licensed you probably had to pay for it like
4269760	4276400	I remember having yes some of them you do they do those like it's like an actual like level pack
4276400	4281240	like I remember Pirates of the Caribbean one I got I kind of miss a little big planet like I know
4281240	4284800	that I know they did one on PlayStation 4 but it's been a few I'm ready for I'm ready for another
4284800	4287840	little bit got it yeah we got it free not too long ago well you're not gonna get a little big player
4287840	4291960	and get that was it dreams or whatever they call that now which is sort of like a little big plan
4291960	4296120	but not sure they'll have a little big planet costumes in there cool I guess all of those
4296120	4300320	costumes though have been free they aren't DLC in the fact that you have to buy them which makes
4300320	4306240	me think maybe they're doing all of this build-up to announce like DLC 83 or something like I'd be
4306240	4310160	so down for Mario Odyssey DLC I feel like they're not done with the game because they keep rolling
4310160	4315960	out new things you know with as much crap as we give Nintendo and online they do DLC very fucking
4315960	4321720	well like their DLC stuff that they do is like really robust yeah I've already bought the
4321720	4326480	Splatoon DLC even though it's not even out yeah well sure but that's that's how they get you all
4326480	4332880	right let's move on we have more new speaking of a time to announce things right Logie right so
4332880	4338440	let's talk about III III is right around the corner just in June and we've already got the
4338440	4343760	press conference schedule so starting things off everything is still kind of walking and taking
4343760	4350480	place on the weekend before almost so Saturday you have EA which was June 9th at 11 p.m. Pacific
4350480	4357480	time so they're gonna have their conference then month or on Sunday they're gonna have of course
4357480	4363760	the Microsoft press event at 1 p.m. and then of course interrupting our show as they've done in
4363760	4370320	the last few years we have Bethesda fault certainly are shortly after and I hear rumors at least I
4370320	4375400	there was a rumored list of like some you know the Microsoft marketing rights for certain games
4375400	4381960	and all their scroll six is on there and I'm like please so we'll see they're just gonna give us a
4381960	4387880	name yeah it's not gonna come out for years but I they have to really scatter out now it's time
4387880	4393840	for Elder Scrolls six no they need to release Skyrim on four more platforms nope six it's on
4393840	4399480	all the platforms it's not mobile yet but it's not on 3ds scroll six would be this year uh-huh
4399480	4403960	that's it you know what though we say like oh it wouldn't be for years but you know they've been
4403960	4408120	working on it for a long time though I think and they don't tend to announce shit until like it's
4408120	4412240	gonna come out that year like what do they have coming out this year I mean I don't really know
4412240	4417720	what their lineup is at all everything that they've announced is already out I think maybe doom 2 I
4417720	4423720	think would have been would be a logical choice like a doom 2 and perhaps I would have assumed
4423720	4429840	like a Fallout New Vegas type type of there could be a new like a remaster of Fallout New Vegas or
4429840	4437480	something like that maybe or just like a spin-off fallout with the Fallout 4 engine but I fuck if
4437480	4443440	it's Elder Scrolls 6 this year sign me up like you are allowed to interrupt OLR to announce
4443440	4455480	a new Elder Scrolls 6 anyways then on Monday of course we have Ubisoft at 1 p.m. Pacific and then
4455520	4462800	following that Nintendo is gonna have their thing on Tuesday at starting at 9 now what exactly
4462800	4467240	Nintendo's thing is gonna be well we've got a little bit more information regarding that so on
4467240	4473000	June 11th they're gonna do a Splatoon 2 World Championship and that's gonna be from 3 30 p.m.
4473000	4480280	to 6 p.m. Pacific time with the finals on the 12th they're gonna have their video presentation at 9
4480280	4488040	a.m. on June 12th as well and of course they're gonna include Smash Brothers in that as you know
4488040	4492760	on top of other announcements they're gonna do the Nintendo treehouse live for three days
4492760	4497880	afterwards kind of similar to what they've done in the past and then Super Smash Brothers invitationals
4497880	4504360	2018 which is gonna be on June 12th they didn't see though which version of the game that is I
4504440	4514800	feel like it's got to be the Wii U one maybe who knows if the new one is an upgrade ish of the Wii
4514800	4520440	U one then they could do the new one yeah you mean if it's an enhanced remake kind of if it's
4520440	4526120	like I don't know it'll say Splatoon 2 to Splatoon 1 but some of the Splatoon players don't like that
4526120	4531600	comparison but anyway yeah so at least that's what's coming and just right around the corner
4531600	4540160	you'll not even like two months away in a month and a couple days I'm looking at chat over at
4540160	4546120	live.vognetware.com sj100 Matt says Bethesda will probably announce at least another mobile game
4546120	4553480	that will go live when the presentation is over that seems to be their deal okay they had the
4553480	4557840	fallout shelter they had a trading card game yeah I think they've kind of done that before
4558000	4562640	maybe it's got maybe a Skyrim an Elder Scrolls game that was a trading card game was Elder
4562640	4568480	Scrolls well shit uh dungeon buster says Elder Scrolls online is getting another expansion this
4568480	4574080	summer set in the Somerset region of Tamriel but I Elder Scrolls online I would think has kind of
4574080	4578040	like their own dedicated team at this point and like what they're doing doesn't really influence
4578040	4583800	the production yeah that that they that's already coming out so they may talk about a little bit
4583840	4591160	saying hey this just came out but I don't think it's gonna be SSJ 100 Matt suggests Wolfenstein
4591160	4601200	Nazi punching clicker game I'm in I'm in all right e3 look forward to it well this is a game
4601200	4605560	I know you're gonna see a lot of it e3 but we got some more information this week on shadow of the
4605560	4610800	Tomb Raider because there was a new trailer that showed up for the game that made its way online
4610800	4616960	and there was a panel that occurred at the Tribeca Film Festival of all places talking must be
4616960	4620720	because of the movie where they were talking a little bit about shadow of the Tomb Raider and
4620720	4625720	it sounds like behind the scenes some press got to play about 45 minutes of the new game so you'll
4625720	4629120	probably see plenty more of this e3 this year but they're definitely ramping up for shadow of the
4629120	4632960	Tomb Raider which I'm assuming must be a holiday release this must be one of the big holiday
4632960	4639760	releases they talk about Laura goes from being being hunted to becoming the hunter she's smart
4639800	4645440	and resourceful and there's more stealth in the game I guess they have the game in the jungle this
4645440	4651080	time she goes from Mexico to Peru she has all the skills she got in the previous games so they had
4651080	4654520	to put her in an environment where she's still in danger and the jungle kind of works for that
4654520	4659680	dr. Dominguez is the name of the antagonist the head of Trinity they'll talk a little bit more
4659680	4664200	about that at e3 they also say the game is gonna have a lot of open exploration and will have a
4664200	4668280	lot of characters that can be met in the world apparently even in the first sequence there's
4668280	4672440	other people and you weren't really used to I mean you kind of would run into other people
4672440	4676400	here and there in the old Tomb Raider games but you're gonna definitely kind of see more people
4676400	4682920	than this and also swimming underwater so Laura's learned to swim like well and there are I'm sure
4682920	4687080	she's got some things that keep her afloat I'm kidding okay and there are special things and
4687080	4693480	secrets to be found by taking risks and swimming deeper someone got the joke thank you all right
4693480	4701040	anyway there'll be more to come at e3 by the way just you know I das Montreal is actually making
4701040	4705200	this game it is not coming from Crystal Dynamics it's actually I das Montreal that's doing this
4705200	4710840	game so some people have asked well why is I das Montreal doing this and basically they they they
4710840	4716320	kind of gave a line about well since we did Deus Ex mankind divided it fits perfectly with Laura's
4716320	4720760	arc we're the perfect choice new it's new flavors you don't always want to do the same thing I don't
4720880	4724480	know why they just didn't fucking say Crystal Dynamics is doing the Marvel game we already
4724480	4729400	knew that they it's not a secret they announced that at last e3 the Crystal Dynamics is doing
4729400	4735560	this Marvel game so we were talking a little bit about how they're the rumors of like where they
4735560	4741000	were trying to tie in like just cause and stuff like that with other you know properties within
4741000	4746520	this mm-hmm Marvel Universe we're gonna bring them into the Marvel Universe now because you know
4746520	4754520	no because Disney that's that's where things get complicated there but well I would imagine
4754520	4761320	this a Marvel game is something we've got to see more about it this I hope so but if if Shadow of
4761320	4768120	the Tomb Raider is kind of Square Enix is big kind of this side of the shores release for the
4768120	4773800	end of the year I would assume the Marvel project is maybe spring early summer next year to tie in
4773960	4780000	with the net because the the last move well I the last is it the last movie the next movie the next
4780000	4784400	Avengers movie that's the last part of this fit because I can't imagine they're gonna stop making
4784400	4791040	Avengers movies I don't the actors contracts are up after this next one or a lot of them it's they
4791040	4795960	have a way to deal with that based on the last movie so it'll be fine all right all right fine
4795960	4802480	so fascinating whatever the the last known Avengers movie is next summer right because they they must
4802480	4806400	have done these two back-to-back right they said that it was gonna I think I saw on Twitter like
4806400	4812320	370 days so it's almost it's a little over a year from now okay so it's but it is is next is it's
4812320	4818080	2019 is the last movie which does not have a title because I guess that would be a spoiler okay the
4818080	4824240	title what I'm really a spoiler so I'll say no more but okay so I mean it would make a lot of
4824240	4830320	sense if crystal dynamics you know is gonna drop this you know what I imagine is going to be you
4830320	4835440	know if it's anything like the Tomb Raider reboot that game was fucking rad when it came out like it
4835440	4839320	really was kind of pushing the envelope you know and if they're gonna do that with Marvel and make
4839320	4846880	a heaven forbid good movie video game tie-in brace yourselves then or it could be terrible
4846880	4850880	Marvel Ultimate Alliance was pretty good yeah that's true that's true but I mean like something
4850880	4856200	on the level of like Tomb Raider with Marvel characters is gonna be badass I don't know how
4856200	4860720	that would play but yeah I want to see what it is and we're just assuming that it's going to be
4860720	4865920	a Tomb Raider game with Marvel characters there's obviously they think they have an empty palette
4865920	4869560	they can do whatever they want but it would make a lot of sense I don't know dark soccer you like
4869560	4876360	Marvel would you play a Tomb Raider with Marvel characters yes yeah me too so I'm all for I really
4876360	4881840	just wanted Jessica Jones game she just walks around drinking and then punching people okay
4881840	4888200	so like Phoenix Wright but with Jessica Jones no I would like that no it needs it needs more
4888200	4894280	violence all right okay and she doesn't do courtroom so okay but like the investigative
4894280	4899400	part yeah but I don't want like Phoenix Wright so like Sam and more like instead of objection
4899400	4905280	it's just a punch I would maybe if it had to be like a visual novel so I'd want it to be more
4905280	4912200	like danganronpa okay but I'd rather it be like just a standard so you want a danganronpa game
4912200	4919120	with Jessica Jones not really I just want a game just like a standard more like L.A. noir maybe
4919120	4924640	okay but you know that type of game all right that's fair so well we'll see we'll see I'm
4924640	4928400	hoping this e3 we're gonna hear a little more about what that is because I'm assuming that's
4928400	4934640	gonna be a tie-in for the next Avengers movie release since we know it's only a year out so
4934640	4938960	some folks in chat are talking about Captain Marvel and how that's currently filming and
4938960	4943040	Tiger Claw says Captain Marvel is gonna be interesting because that movie is set in the
4943040	4948680	90s and we'll deal with the Scrolls so she has Rachel here all right I'm I'm looking forward
4948680	4954640	to not seeing it because I don't see any other Marvel like Rachel from Friends yes Oh the Rachel
4954640	4961160	the Rachel haircut yeah she has the Rachel haircut that's okay because I I love Carol Danvers as a
4961160	4967160	character which I was really disappointed that it was Trish and not Carol Danvers in the Jessica
4967160	4975280	Jones series cuz in alias in the pulse her BFF is Carol Danvers but I don't mind if we get a
4975280	4980320	whole Carol Danvers movie that makes me happy how do you feel about Brie Larson I'm super happy
4980320	4985640	because I mean the last thing I saw her in was Scott Pilgrim oh right right oh my god like all
4985640	4990040	those actors and actresses of Scott Pilgrim like went on to like these huge things it's crazy yeah
4990560	4995400	so I like Brie Larson and she's got a great voice yeah and she's a Sacramento person isn't she
4995400	5004160	Sacramento actresses I think she is hmm her and that other redhead all right anyway let's move on
5004160	5010160	Dark Sakura what do you have for us well a game that I'm actually very interested in that has been
5010160	5018680	on my radar this week but it's a very interesting one not just for how it's played but the the
5018680	5026480	content as well but it's an interaction an interactive story it's it's a smartphone game
5026480	5032820	as well called bury me my love and it's about a woman named now or who's trying to escape the
5032820	5039080	civil war in Syria by fleeing to Europe and the story is told through text messages however it's
5039080	5045360	based on stories of actual Syrian refugees who you know are trying to communicate with people
5045360	5052960	back home to show their you know their experiences with this and it makes a very strong statement on
5052960	5061960	what these people are going through and of course the you know the reactions around the world and
5061960	5069640	on top of this too you actually get to see the results of your decisions almost immediately like
5069720	5079320	do you do you sleep somewhere dangerous do you try to pay to bypass dangerous places you know
5079320	5085560	and what the consequences of these actions are gonna be so and this is made by pixel hunt and
5085560	5093360	it looks amazing and I think it would make me cry and it's on both iOS and Android I like the concept
5093360	5097720	of the game where it's kind of like playing when you're not playing it type of thing mm-hmm how it
5097720	5102920	might send you like text messages as notifications and yeah it's kind of neat yeah that's a very
5102920	5108400	interesting interface and I just think I would cry so all right well you should download it and have
5108400	5114120	a cry you should download it and then support or if the refugees fair enough is there any tie-in
5114120	5119720	for fundraising for that to the game I didn't see sorry all right well there's other mobile games you
5119720	5125840	could play right look good yes in fact if you're a Harry Potter fan there's a new Hogwarts game
5125840	5134880	that's on mobile playing it Hogwarts mystery and basically the game has it takes place before the
5134880	5141960	actual events in the books so you're trying to investigate I guess your brother has run away or
5141960	5146440	been expelled from school and trying to figure that stuff out but the thing that everybody loves
5146440	5152440	the most about this and it's you know wonderful trope of mobile games is energy gotta love that
5152480	5157240	energy oh you want to do that action well I'm sorry you can't because of energy if only you
5157240	5164080	had more energy and so that is one of the gripes that people have been making about the game is
5164080	5168480	that oh yeah you want to get out of the escape the devil's snare hope you have enough energy
5168480	5172840	you're gonna have to buy that with premium currency the dar Cyrus since you've been playing it have
5172840	5177760	you been annoyed by energy yet I'll be honest I haven't been playing get a whole bunch so she
5177760	5181760	probably hasn't hit the wall yet cuz usually usually you can play a good chunk of the game
5181800	5185240	where it keeps giving you items that will give you energy so you can go for a little while and
5185240	5190640	the BAM you hit a wall yeah I mean it looks cool to me you go to classes you learn spells and that
5190640	5195560	kind of stuff you can pick which house you're in so to be fair if it is a good game then you know
5195560	5199580	kicking a little money at it shouldn't be the end of the world it's kind of like you know Super
5199580	5204080	Mario run if that was something you were into then you pay ten dollars and get the full game
5204080	5209840	right or you buy it for five dollars when it's on sale or that if you are lucky enough to get it at
5209840	5214200	that point but yeah I mean but it's I guess they chose not to go that route with this game where
5214200	5218680	they could have just had you hit a wall and say pay five bucks to pass they decided to do the
5218680	5223680	energy thing yes maybe because the five dollars ten dollars to pass thing didn't work out so well
5223680	5228080	for super because it works in other mobile games and maybe figure they're gonna make some money
5228080	5234040	that way maybe all right well I downloaded it but I haven't played it yet I'm looking forward
5234040	5239040	to Harry Potter wizards unite because of the whole AR gaming thing but we'll see I'm hoping
5239040	5243240	it'll let me be a Slytherin that'll be fun anyway before we get to the classic game of the week
5243240	5246800	let's talk about some twitch news it's only fair we talked about some mixer news how about some
5246800	5252760	twitch news so apparently now you know how you can give people bits on twitch which yeah when
5252760	5257640	you're watching my stream over at Rob Roberts cheap plug you can show me your biddies you can
5257640	5261740	give me biddies while I'm playing games and that actually basically you're giving me money which
5261740	5266960	who doesn't like money and honestly the money just goes to pay for all this stuff here at OLR
5266960	5273240	like I just paid the hosting bill for the network this week and yeah but anyway no it's fine it's
5273240	5279280	fine um but obviously money helps buy new games and who doesn't like a little bit of money there
5279280	5287640	are now more ways to incorporate bit stuff onto your stream and that is through extensions so now
5287640	5293260	twitch has released a variety of extensions that will actually interact with bit donations for
5293260	5299220	example there's one for League of Legends where you can predict winners and stuff using bits I
5299220	5303460	don't know if that means it's like a gambling thing where you might win bits if you predict
5303460	5307220	correctly me it's kind of sounds like that a little bit like you might be doing gambling
5307220	5311620	with bits I don't want to quote that until I've tried this myself because that could get very
5311620	5317740	interesting if you're like gambling without gambling yeah it's currency that you're buying
5317740	5321860	that you're gambling with it's like pachinko it could be interesting I don't know but there's also
5322020	5326660	things like voting studios so you can actually like make a poll and then in order to vote in
5326660	5333140	the poll you would have to donate biddies to do that so you know as somebody who does some live
5333140	5338340	streaming and who is an affiliate on Twitch I'm I think this is cool for people that will be into
5338340	5343340	it but like you know I don't I don't know I don't want to do like voting based on how much money you
5343340	5350220	give me that's just for me that's how it works in the real world Rob I it's just accuracy well
5350260	5356820	played well play well I I don't want the NRA donating to the polls on my stream or any of
5356820	5361780	that stuff but I don't know I would have to see maybe for the right integration like there's some
5361780	5367140	where you can play games with the streamer and things like that and maybe I don't know but I
5367140	5372300	don't know if I I see the right fit for that yet I like to do as much stuff as possible for free
5372300	5377940	and then if you feel so inclined watch an ad and throw the bits at me like that's that's you know
5377940	5385340	even if it's just five cents ten cents you know what y'all it adds up it adds up all right let's
5385340	5389900	see s 200 Matt and chat over at live dog network comm says predict Rob will scream at this one
5389900	5394020	scary part in this jump scare game yep that's something you could do a biddies if you wanted
5394020	5398100	to or be even better if it was like you know how they have the twitch integration with different
5398100	5404460	games where you can like send a jump scare and pay some biddies to send a job maybe maybe yeah
5404460	5409460	pay some biddies to get jump scared oh I bet I bet that could be a thing the developers have to
5409460	5412700	kind of put that in the game though I don't know if that would be through extensions I should point
5412700	5418380	out to the other interesting thing about the extensions with biddies is that you only get as
5418380	5424420	the streamer you get 80% of the bitty money you don't get the full hundred percent that you do
5424420	5428880	if somebody just tips you or whatever you only get 80% because you know where the other 20% is
5428880	5433860	going the extension developer yeah to promote them to keep doing extensions so that's something
5433900	5438020	else to think about too is that if I use it through extensions I'm actually kind of getting
5438020	5443380	less money although maybe I'm incentivizing getting more so it's it's a lot to think about
5443380	5448940	I don't know all right anyhow let's let's go back to a simpler time when you know what there was no
5448940	5454100	there was no way to live stream your game during Sega's really weird arcade phase right I think I
5454100	5459180	think you still had to have a camcorder on your shoulder if you wanted to film this right anyway
5459180	5463140	it's the classic game of the week where dark soccer is gonna step into the gaming vault and
5463140	5469420	find a game that she thinks hey you brats never came out at home as far as I know all right here
5469420	5473300	it is the classic game of the week dark soccer would you pick this week I picked a game called
5473300	5480420	brave firefighters also known as show bullshit brave firefighters in Japan it is a light gun
5480420	5488980	game and it was the as I recall the first Hikaru game for the Sega Hikaru software came out in 1999
5488980	5495980	it has a vibrating light gun control it's in the shape of a fire hose you can fight the fires
5495980	5503300	because the fires need to be thought so you can save your pot stash like Willie Nelson actually
5503300	5510180	that was a true story anyway and it was as I said the first title that came out for the Hikaru
5510180	5515900	system and it was also at the time the most technically advanced game of its time it was
5515900	5522380	the first one that used Fong shading and now it's the most common shading technique had some
5522380	5529580	really great lighting and particle fire effects and one of the most detailed environments so this
5529580	5534580	particular game have you ever played this Rob I think I've seen it I feel like one of the because
5534580	5539620	this is like it was only released in Japan right um no really it came out in the US I feel like I
5539620	5543380	saw it somewhere but it was like at an import arcade like either like I don't see arcade
5543380	5549300	infinity but another one of those type of places I saw it in I want to see one of those like
5549300	5555740	Koreatown arcades I think I saw this in Las Vegas okay yeah that's when I played it yeah but anyway
5555740	5562220	the story is that there is an electrical fault that caused the Whitehead Hotel to go up in flames
5562220	5567420	and Mayor Taylor and his family are trapped inside so you have to go through and put out the fires
5567420	5575380	and rescue the mayor and his family so you can you hold the drainage button on the hose control
5575380	5581580	to release the steam a stream of water but you will deplete your water gauge as you go forward
5581580	5590980	so you can also twist the nozzle to have like a fog effect that can extinguish fires and flying
5590980	5595660	sparks as well as destroy obstacles that are in your path you have a time limit for each stage
5595700	5601100	but you get extra seconds if for each fire that's extinguished quickly and of course when the time
5601100	5607420	runs out the game ends there was a modified version of brave firefighters that was donated
5607420	5614460	to the Kyoto Kyoto City disaster prevention center that a different scenario and opening
5614460	5624380	movie and no time limit so I guess it was for I guess teaching disaster relief but anyway this
5624380	5632180	particular game again it was notable for being the first Hikaru game which as in essence it was
5632180	5639820	a modified version of the NAOMI hardware system it had a custom Sega graphics chip larger memory
5639820	5647100	capacity and they made those modifications for the sake of releasing brave firefighters because
5647100	5653860	the engineering the engineers had difficulty creating 3d images of the flame and the water
5653860	5664100	with the NAOMI capability so there you go it led us to all kinds of new innovations that really
5664100	5674300	was the big big thing about it it was produced by Rikiya Nakagawa and it came out in 1999 that's
5674300	5681220	about it it was one of those like I said it's that weird era of Sega games yeah but that's
5681260	5688900	like the cool stuff honestly it is it is and as far as like other stuff that was that came out
5688900	5697580	for Hikaru I mean I've already covered Planet Harriers which really I think did like the really
5697580	5703740	the best I think made the most of the of the system but other of the Hikaru games was the
5703740	5708580	NASCAR arcade Planet Harriers Starward Racer arcade air tricks which we played a lot of that
5708580	5717180	and virtual on force and Hikaru was succeeded by NAOMI too so there you go all right s2100
5717180	5721900	Matt in our chat says this running water gameplay sound will make all the podcast listeners want to
5721900	5736900	pee for sure well it is a game about fire hoses anyway there it is your classic game of the week
5736900	5741180	brave firefighters there were all kinds of games like that they were coming out at the time
5741180	5750020	remember oh yeah like we had what was the Konami ones we had the mocap games like the punch mania
5750020	5753780	or whatever was called those punch mania but I'm trying to think of what was the police 911 oh
5753780	5759020	yeah please no one was one and there was like a boxing one too right yeah I remember that but
5759020	5764380	man that was and I think like what did deadstorm pirates come out on dark to see us as mocap golf
5764380	5773060	yeah that was it yeah but I'm trying to remember when deadstorm pirates came out it was it wasn't
5773060	5779260	one of the Sega games was it maybe not all right well you look into that while we take a break
5779260	5782740	we're gonna take a break and when we come back there's plenty more of Orange Lounge radio to
5782740	5787620	come including rapid-fire news maybe emails although there weren't any when I check before

5837780	5841540	the show there's there's a little bit of caffeine there's enough caffeine to hopefully starve off
5841540	5847500	the the brain problems I hope the brains well I hope I hope it is enough to silence your brain
5847500	5853740	and then Loki my brain meets quiver Loki's working on all those amiibos in the other room
5853740	5858860	yeah it's back now so hello hello but I've got all the Animal Crossing ones if you want to use
5858860	5862860	this too Rob's got everything I don't have the whole Animal Crossing series I don't think the
5862860	5866860	Animal Crossing ones have costumes in Odyssey yeah they don't work for the Mario games they're fine
5866860	5871980	whatever sorry I was gonna say though JD because you mentioned we didn't have an opportunity to
5871980	5875980	bring this up earlier in the show we should mention it now so JD's been spending the weekend
5875980	5881260	with me and we've been you know doing doing such manly things like yesterday we went and
5881260	5887660	got mani pedis it was so much fun and it was oh my god I don't know why more dudes don't allow
5887660	5891780	themselves just go get mani pedis because seriously my nails have never looked better
5891780	5899020	like and I don't okay now JD went the extra route and went with a glitter blue color so like his
5899020	5905420	nails are like like nails so I did like a lighter turquoise on my hands and like a deep like royal
5905420	5912700	blue on my toes okay do you remember when we had Steve here for Flom yeah he always has his done
5912700	5917300	yeah I mean and honestly my nails don't look good well here's the I didn't I they're they're quote
5917300	5921860	unquote painted but it's clear yeah and the only reason I had them do the clear is that a it does
5921860	5927660	look really good but B it makes me not bite them and so like honestly like the best tip if you bite
5927660	5931300	your nails you want to stop doing it like paint your nails clear used to never stop me because
5931540	5936580	really oh my god so disgusting those are trying to eat a switch cartridge it would I would just
5936580	5940740	peel all of it off in this to go back to chewing but I'm always like okay I'm always like disgusted
5940740	5945020	and I was a kid though I'm also just I'm disgusted and fascinated when they do the nails because they
5945020	5948860	don't just they don't just trim the nails like they dig the whole thing into the cuticles to
5948860	5953180	like help prevent hang nails and stuff like that and I'm always like shocked at how much shit they
5953180	5957660	get it I'm like oh my god that's all on my this is what the sad thing is that cuticle is actually
5957660	5962300	do serve a purpose yeah except that people have started taking it off to make it look like you've
5962300	5967180	got a longer nail bed mm-hmm I mean that's the whole thing for it but I think that you know
5967180	5972860	keeping it I'd say trimmed like at least every month or so you know promotes healthy growth so
5972860	5979020	I need I need to I'm probably gonna go get all mine done before drag con well but if you're not
5979020	5984060	wearing nails you're not doing drag I got I'm saying you can you can get just a manicure
5984060	5988380	pedicure without having your nails like done yeah use basically basically it's like getting
5988380	5993580	a haircut you don't know in there and get it died and I want a white gel base cut hmm but I
5993580	5999020	want gels just to have something that Alan have that done not that long ago he had like the blue
5999020	6003620	gel it looked really good even though it's like you know you don't see a lot of dudes with their
6003620	6007060	nails painted but it looked really good but it was like dang that's like permit he had to go in
6007060	6010820	it took him like 30 minutes to get it off yeah cuz you have to soak them off yeah yeah but Rob
6010820	6015540	if you get the gels you won't be able to bite your nails that's because they're like they're
6015540	6020420	really yeah that's true but I always recommend because I had them glued on once and it ruined
6020420	6025020	my remember when we didn't allow to my nails were so thin and hurt to the touch oh yeah that was
6025020	6030060	because they glued them on and I reacted to the glue so you always should have them build on top
6030060	6033660	of the natural nail you know and if you play a lot of DDR or pump it up you should treat yourself
6033660	6040260	to a pedicure because yeah or if you that athlete you know athletes have to get pedicures like all
6040260	6044700	the time because they fuck up their feet yeah so Loki have you ever had a mani-pedi you should
6044700	6048420	consider getting one done now that's a lot of fun it's fun we'll go some time dance dance and he
6048420	6052140	would go with me because there's two nails are atrocious and I can't do anything with them there
6052140	6057820	you go all right I'm his esthetician all right let's move on we got to get back to video games
6057820	6062660	you have to have those perfect fingers to hold controllers so that the big old you know gross
6062660	6068500	nails don't get in the way anyway to register participation for this week's episode of orange
6068540	6075260	lounge radio at fog network comm use the passphrase teacher let's get into some rapid fire news and
6075260	6080060	talk about some other news that has happened this week rapidly Loki let's talk about my favorite
6080060	6086980	topic when it comes to Nintendo and that's online it's still coming out September at least whatever
6086980	6092220	they have planned however they're gonna be talking about what it is that's gonna be coming out in
6092220	6100820	September it's gonna be revealed in May so this is coming from the current president Tatsumi Kimi
6100820	6107580	Shima basically say that Nintendo switch online a paid subscription service that will expand the
6107580	6112580	online functionality of the switch will begin in September of this year the service will provide
6112580	6117860	consumers with a richness of online features that allow them to continuously enjoy Nintendo switch
6117860	6124540	more from hot air hot air I know it's like this doesn't tell me jack shit I do know that they have
6124540	6130820	the costs listed online but we still don't know exactly what that will entail and it says it's
6130820	6136180	gonna have access to a library of classic games I just wish they would still like I don't don't
6136180	6140220	be wrong I think it's cool that they want to do like a Netflix type thing where you have access
6140220	6145580	to stuff but the same time just let me buy things like it's worked for the other systems why now
6145580	6151060	do you okay I'm I'm all for a Netflix style classic thing that would just you could play
6151060	6156980	whatever you want that would be an amazing deal oh my god but did you notice I don't think it
6156980	6161100	comes up later in the show where I hope I'm not spoiling a story but there was a bunch of
6161100	6166880	trademarks by Nintendo this week on things like dr. Mario and some other Mario games so and my
6166880	6171260	brain went to because some people are like oh they're gonna redo these games so no these are
6171260	6177060	probably the first releases on this Nintendo online probably dr. Mario would make a lot of
6177060	6182660	sense a lot of sense as a debut game especially if this is whole you can play with friends across
6182660	6188580	the internet dr. Mario makes a fuck of a lot of sense as a game to include with this to start and
6188580	6192820	I'm fine if those games have that functionality but I would also like it like if I don't care
6192820	6196700	about playing over the other people they just be able to purchase the virtual console games
6196700	6203060	you've released on a few systems already yeah I mean why I'm sure Nintendo will happily take your
6203060	6211740	money in whatever form you want to give it to him we'll see I don't know anyways and then of course
6211740	6217220	we talked about it a couple weeks ago about how the rock star was basically giving polling some
6217220	6225660	music from Grand Theft Auto 4 in regards to most of us was to be from the the Russian radio station
6225660	6230220	that was in the game but apparently it's not just that so there are several different stations are
6230220	6237260	affected by this and even like a lot of the rock songs so they even had like of David Bowie songs
6237260	6244620	taken from the game I know I kind of went through the whole list of stuff thankfully the some of the
6244620	6251140	songs I did listen to quite a bit are still in the game but some are not in the ones that they
6251140	6258060	replace them with are kind of lame I don't know and I I find it frustrating though like and I
6258060	6263060	understand why that they have to patch this out now because they're still selling the game it
6263060	6267460	would be different than like say if they sold the game and then they weren't selling it anymore and
6267460	6272820	so the other licenses expired there's nothing that they're gonna really do to the game but now it's
6272820	6278700	still some active thing that it's just gonna be removed from it so if you have a console version
6278780	6284700	the game you're kind of screwed however if you're on PC people have already found ways to put back
6284700	6290820	the removed songs into the game so if you are you know bothered by that course they did then you can
6290820	6296780	go ahead and do that and of course if you have like a PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 version of that
6296780	6303060	those games then you can always keep your console offline if you want to keep your you know songs in
6303060	6308980	there honestly I mean it's disappointing I did like a lot of the Russian songs that were in the
6308980	6313820	game but I it wasn't one of the main stations I listened to I mean it wasn't the first the
6313820	6319060	granted out for that was before you know the validate Tony and lost in the dam where they
6319060	6323700	added more a whole nother I think dance music station so I listened to the rest of the station
6323700	6332260	because it was mostly it was Russian music and dance music which why okay all right well moving
6332340	6337620	on to talk about Nintendo Splatfest the next Splatfest has been announced and it's it's a
6337620	6341420	little different it's not kind of the same that they've been doing for other Splatfest because
6341420	6347140	this is gonna be a three-parter because it is to determine who is your favorite Ninja Turtle and
6347140	6352500	so the first round starts this next weekend which will be Raphael versus Leonardo will be the first
6352500	6359460	matchup Raphael Leonardo actually round two will be Mike Michelangelo or Mikey versus Donny did they
6359460	6364580	shorten all the names Donatello yeah Donatello that's what they call them now the new Nickelodeon
6364580	6371220	series all right Mikey and Donny then around two and then the finals will be May 18th and obviously
6371220	6375060	Donatello is the best and should be the one that everybody picks although I don't know how these
6375060	6380140	new ones are I'm thinking Donatello from back in the day so maybe maybe it's different it's always
6380140	6387100	the best this is probably the first splat I'm not gonna you just you're really I can't be bothered
6387100	6391220	with this huh I mean Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was never my thing plus we could have had the
6391220	6396060	Japan one and I'm so mad well let's talk about the Japan one actually since you brought it up so
6396060	6402020	Japan doesn't really have the same thing with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles so instead the San
6402020	6407380	Rio character collaboration ranking contest is happening in Japan voting for the event starts on
6407380	6412860	May 10th there will be characters represented in a crossover including Splatoon 2 cross San
6412900	6417380	Rio I but then there's a cute little Hello Kitty dressed up as an inkling type of thing it looks
6417380	6421060	adorable I don't know if that means they're getting like a San Rio Splatfest or what that
6421060	6425260	is we don't know exactly understanding but that's probably what it is Hello Kitty versus Bats
6425260	6429660	Maru I would so be about that that would be amazing why can't they do that over here as well
6429660	6435980	I'm right good question good fucking question it's it's weird some of the marketing choices
6435980	6440860	that they've made because they've done like McDonald's Splatfest in Japan only and I'm like
6440860	6447660	you'd think that if they were gonna do that there well it was like chicken nuggets versus fries I
6447660	6452460	mean it was like dude you can't put anything up against fries fries are always gonna win
6452460	6457300	but chicken McNuggets already good see see now we have a Splatfest already but the point was
6457300	6462380	like McDonald's is just such a very classic American thing that I'm surprised they didn't
6462380	6468660	decide to do it here yeah you know they need to do here is the flavorings like they have at
6468660	6474220	McDonald's in Japan right oh they already did that disgusting ketchup and mayonnaise why no
6474220	6477940	it's like ketchup and mustard no I'm talking about that you put them in the bag and shake
6477940	6486540	them up and they have like a curry flavor and here with the fries too they have like flavored
6486540	6493260	fries that's right they did they had the shaker bags McDonald's and they sucked ass so like it
6493260	6499660	wasn't curry it was like ranch flavor it'd be amazing ranching they have like garlic parmesan
6499660	6503300	like ooh I like garlic parmesan and they tried it on the fries like wow these ruin the fries
6503300	6507540	well I'm never doing that again I don't trust McDonald's to have good food I was just saying
6507540	6512100	it's popular here because it's all right all right we're turning too much into orange on foodio
6512100	6517500	let's bring it back to games talking about the next somebody's doing classic games on the switch
6517500	6522900	that's for sure but it is it's neo geo that's actually doing those games on the switch it is

6808820	6814260	work for is a big Warhammer gamer which we found out when we were talking about like cons and stuff
6814260	6820100	it was yeah I've seen actually the big con you know full-scale Warhammer things are pretty
6820100	6826700	exciting to watch but pretty terrible to prepare for all right well this is usually the part of the
6826700	6830660	show where we would visit the mail bag and participate at orange laundry calm to read all
6830660	6833940	those lovely emails you send us I found dust bunnies but I believe we have an empty mail

6871700	6877380	like I don't even know how many listeners we have anymore all right so moving on let's get into some
6877380	6883780	more gaming news Loki all right so things are kind of getting ridiculous as far as the whole
6883780	6891460	pub G cheans sorry goes so you may remember there was a group of people that were making certain
6892300	6898140	subscription cheat services for pub G and they made quite a billion or quite a bit of money off
6898140	6905380	of that of course they found themselves in so with some legal trouble with bluehole now there's
6905380	6913500	actually been arrests and fines being placed on them so they had 15 suspects that were arrested
6913500	6920500	for developing hack programs hosting marketplaces for hack programs and brokering transactions the
6920500	6927500	currently the suspects have been fined approximately 5.1 million dollars and then other suspects
6927500	6933460	related to the case are still being investigated sucks to be them dude I didn't know you could go
6933460	6938940	to jail for cheating in an online game well I think it's more than just it's probably making
6938940	6945940	the cheats and you know still though come on it's a fucking game what kind this is in the US no okay
6945980	6951100	so it's other other countries is against the law yeah yeah that's what it is so wow all right I
6951100	6956820	guess they take that stuff seriously but seriously though like I get it I get yeah it's bad that they
6956820	6962060	you're cheating yeah you know shut them down do a cease and desist and all that shit but really
6962060	6967900	arresting people and fighting them 5.1 million dollars haven't we talked about a spanking like
6967900	6971740	I'm not talking about a caning or any of that stuff I'm talking about you need to take them
6971740	6975820	and spank them and say you've been very very naughty it's super nanny needs to come out and
6975820	6980340	do it is she even still around super nanny needs to come out and spank them and say you've been
6980340	6991660	very naughty just need friend dresser to come out you should see I was just thinking bad wicked
6991660	6999020	naughty suit and say you've been very must give us all good spanking very naughty you shouldn't
6999020	7006980	cheat in games it's very naughty I just think it's ridiculous that but I I could totally see
7006980	7011460	blue hole doing this because these are the same fucking people are like you copied us we're
7011460	7016380	fucking pissed off so we're suing you because you use a fucking frying pan in your fucking game so
7016380	7025420	yes I could see them doing some bullshit like this all right anyhow guys you don't chat at
7025420	7031620	live.vog network.com wants to know how the fuck did that nanny show stay on TV so long there's a
7031620	7036540	lot of shows isn't a friend dresser was great because she was also in UHF and this is final
7036540	7042860	tap The Simpsons I think has officially become the longest-running scripted series on television
7042860	7049780	ever and that is a show that stopped being funny a long time ago and we still have more episodes
7049780	7055980	of them and yeah same boat but what can you do all right SHO 100 Matt suggests they should all
7055980	7067060	have to endure a yelling by the God Warrior lady this is dark-sided I do miss wife swap that was a
7067060	7073340	fun that was a good show good times it sounds like a completely different show actually I wife swap
7073340	7079460	was the ABC show God Warrior was on the Fox version was the trading spouses oh same shit
7079460	7084940	big difference oh no no cuz that that God Warrior is better than anything that was ever on one of
7084940	7091180	those names is a pun I think trading spouses is a pun off of trading spaces I think it is yeah I
7091180	7097220	think you're right all right anyway moving on this is unfortunately not really a humorous piece of
7097220	7102340	news because this has to tie into things that have happened in the real world and how they can yes
7102340	7108060	impact the side of video games especially the business side of games so a game was supposed
7108140	7113500	to be released on the switch the PlayStation 4 and Xbox this week Xbox one this week with its
7113500	7119620	different ports that game was called Death Road to Canada and I'm sure you can imagine why it may
7119620	7125300	be in poor taste for a game with that title to come out right now because of the horrific incident
7125300	7130020	that happened in Toronto earlier this week so developer rocket cat games and publisher
7130020	7135780	Yukio publishing have delayed the title indefinitely with a statement that says we
7135860	7139820	feel it would be deeply inappropriate to launch the game at such a time we would like to express
7139820	7145740	our deepest condolences to everyone affected by the tragic events in Toronto so they've they've
7145740	7149820	stopped this indefinitely I don't think that means they'll never put them out but they'll
7149820	7154500	probably push it back to around the holiday or you know a time when hopefully people have been
7154500	7159340	able to heal a little bit from the craziness that happened there it should be pointed out now this
7159340	7164380	article says Death Road to Canada makes no references to aggravated assault but like if
7164380	7169660	you actually look at the game you do play like you're in a car and you're a person in the car
7169660	7173380	but you're like an animal you play this little dog that kind of drives around in the car and
7173380	7178900	you're like fucking shooting and running over people but they're zombies so because they're
7178900	7186700	zombies it's okay but obviously you can see where it's a little too close to events in the real
7186700	7191900	world right now so they've had to delay it so it's just kind of goes to show that sometimes
7191900	7196620	events that happen in the real world they can have an impact on gaming especially because you know
7196620	7201500	it would have been kind of shitty business sense to release a game like that right now you know one
7201500	7205700	of those news networks would have done a very exploitative piece about it so just now is not
7205700	7211740	the time for pit bulls holding shotguns to shoot down zombies and drive over them in their car I
7211740	7216580	will just come out later it is on steam if you want to play the game I will tell you if there's
7216580	7223900	ever a video game that one made into a movie that sounds awesome well anyway it is on steam if you
7223900	7228500	do want to judge for yourself and there's trailers available online and all that stuff so yeah there
7228500	7234940	you go I'm going in chat over at live dot vog network comm s to 100 Matt reminds us there were
7234940	7240180	a ton of games that got delayed due to 9-eleven you know when that happened that also 9-eleven
7240180	7246140	had impact on movies TV all of it oh yeah yeah well like other shows too like Buffy had an
7246180	7251980	episode they delayed because of Columbine yep yep I remember 9-eleven because that caused that show
7251980	7256100	the mole to get really erratic schedule that was my favorite reality game show that was ever on TV
7256100	7260260	the Anderson Cooper hosted and that show was amazing I didn't really see hosted that yeah
7260260	7263780	Anderson Cooper hosted them all the first yeah it was before his big CNN stuff and all that
7263780	7271260	still have gray hair back then yes he did yes he did so he went great really early so I you should
7271260	7276260	and he looked fabulous doing it he was a great host I was still upset with him though you should
7276260	7284500	what are you over Kathy Griffin oh he was such a shit to her over the whole yeah yeah not as bad
7284500	7291300	as Andy Cohen well Andy Cohen is also but anyway look you should go check out Anderson Cooper in
7291300	7294540	his prime on the mole and that was the best reality game show there ever was I'm almost
7294540	7300380	positive it's all on YouTube if you look up the mole season one but season two was displaced by
7300380	7306580	9-eleven because they it got terrible ratings because people didn't you know that they've got
7306580	7312340	boosted back because the news coverage was on else it just it never had a chance it's like the dark
7312340	7315660	shadows revival which I feel like we talked about on the show a few weeks ago the dark shadows
7315660	7321460	revival got screwed up because the Gulf War coverage so anyway Kai's you don't chat says
7321460	7327180	the mole was the shit they fucked it up with celebrity mole ironically now spoiler alert for
7327180	7333300	a show that is well over 10 years old at this point but Kathy Griffin won celebrity mole one
7333300	7338820	of the time she was on it but it was not Anderson Cooper was done being the whole host they had
7338820	7344060	somebody else a moderate shot I think was sport they moved on to sports personalities hosting it
7344060	7348340	and I think he was the one that hosted it that season when Kathy Griffin won that sounds like
7348340	7354500	the worst choice for a reality show host sports personality he wasn't as good as it he did okay
7354820	7359140	but he wasn't Anderson Cooper it was just like I don't remember the guy they tried to do a revival
7359140	7366380	of the mole oh god it was probably 2010 2011 they did a new season of the mole it was the mole
7366380	7373340	season 5 and they had another sports guy doing it and I don't remember his name but it just it
7373340	7378820	just didn't work it was still a decent show but it just wasn't the same as the first two seasons
7378820	7383220	which were amazing didn't they do like an international version too well the mole was
7383220	7386900	an international show it started it started in the Netherlands where I think all our good
7386900	7390700	reality TV comes from that's what I'm thinking cuz like survivors from their big brothers from
7390700	7398460	there all of it yeah so anyway um phantasm chat over at live dog network comm says people think
7398460	7403900	Toronto in the center of the universe in Canada but there's other cities too yes Canada is a very
7403900	7408020	very very big place people sometimes forget that it's a it's a bigger country than the US believe
7408020	7412700	it or not but I mean if there's a lot of less there's a lot of lowly populated areas because
7412700	7416740	the closer you get to the North Pole and all that but if you have a national tragedy like it's
7416740	7420740	sensitive should delay it like it doesn't matter that there's other parts of Canada like they're
7420740	7428700	being sensitive oh for sure for sure anyway um Tiger Claw chat says could a new mole work in
7428700	7434020	today's climate fuck yeah it could I don't know who owns the rights to it here but I always see
7434020	7438140	I love the mole I'm getting into my like soapbox that really doesn't have anything to do with
7438140	7442820	gaming but it's game show so it's kind of adjacent um here's the thing the mole to me
7442820	7446780	part of the reason I loved it is it was very James Bond in the types of things that they had to do
7446780	7452020	and if you didn't know this premise of the mole basically it was that you have ten contestants
7452020	7456780	and they all do these challenges to put money in the pot and at the end of the game one of them is
7456780	7462420	gonna win all the money but one of the contestants is the mole and they are working against to try to
7462420	7467500	fuck up the pot basically and as much money as they can keep out of the pot they get some type
7467500	7472180	of stipend from the producers and so forth so at the end of every episode they have to take a
7472180	7476900	test the contestants take a test who is the mole and that's part probably part of the reason why
7476900	7481500	the show wasn't as glamorous because there's no voting there's no whatever you take a test they
7481500	7485540	did have they called it coalitions which was basically alliances where you could kind of
7485540	7489380	collaborate notes with people and try to figure it out but you know then the mole would get
7489380	7493700	involved in that shit too and fuck players up so you would take these tests and whoever got the
7493700	7497580	lowest score at the end was executed at the end of the episode that's the caught they said welcome
7497580	7503940	to your first execution this is the results of the quiz and it was like suspenseful ass-clenching
7503940	7508780	television the way they did like because Anderson Cooper would like look around the room and he'd be
7508780	7513660	like whoever the contestant I don't remember he'd be like Jamie and he would type the name into the
7513660	7517940	computer and he'd press enter and there would be like the longest fucking pause and then it would
7517940	7522980	go go green and that means they're safe or it would go red and if it went red it would go
7523860	7528100	like that and basically Anderson Cooper would walk over to the contestant say please come with me and
7528100	7531660	pick them up take them out of the room to the car that's it like the other contestants couldn't hug
7531660	7537820	them say goodbye or anything like that just up out and that was awesome like did the odd do you
7537820	7541900	find out who the mole is at the end or do you know from the get-go of course you didn't know you find
7541900	7547340	out at the end because they leave they left clues in every episode and so at the very end they say
7547340	7551700	here was the clue in episode one here was the clue in episode two then they tell you what the
7551700	7555980	clues were to the mole's identity and some of them were really stupid and I think that's part
7555980	7562620	of why the fifth season didn't work is that one of the clues was so obvious and ridiculous like it
7562620	7567980	kind of ruined it I think so I'm not gonna spoil it in case now because I'm actually excited people
7567980	7572420	sound interested in it they might go back and watch it but the first couple seasons were pretty
7572420	7577100	decent with the clues some were a stretch but you know they didn't want the internet was still kind
7577100	7580580	of coming alive in that age and they didn't want people to get out on the internet and say who it
7580580	7584780	was and ruin it for everybody but you would you would find out in the last episode who it was the
7584780	7590820	season with BB Zahara Benet really stretched BB Zahara Benet was not on the mole she was the mole
7590820	7598860	she's not the mole going to chat over at live.voggannetwork.com there's actually comments here
7598860	7603700	Kaijuto says they could make the mole into a video game or a board game too I feel like there was a
7603700	7607700	tie-in that didn't happen I will okay I'm gonna tell you what I'll tell you one more thing about
7607780	7613860	the mole that I thought was brilliant so it was the end of the first episode so you know how like
7613860	7619260	everybody has their luggage that they go on or whatever on a trip or whatever so Anderson Cooper
7619260	7625020	says okay so here is the test I'm gonna ask you all trivia questions about the other players and
7625020	7630380	you're not allowed to confer with each other this challenge is called the burning bags over here on
7630380	7635620	a forklift we have your bags every time you answer a question wrong they will be lowered slowly into
7635620	7641580	this fire if you get three questions wrong your bags will be burned and so what happens like the
7641580	7646340	first three questions they get wrong and so all of their bags burn and they're all fucking crying
7646340	7653500	and shit because like someone's like like they're all like losing their shit but then spoiler alert
7653500	7657140	at the very beginning of the next episode you find out they were just fucking with them those
7657140	7665620	are fake bags yeah like as you're watching you're like this is so fucking cruel I can't what this is
7665620	7671700	like this is mean television so far and then it turns out oh just like that one show they have
7671700	7676620	never they had like that one show it was like the the Joe project or something like that is basically
7676620	7682900	it's one dude so they think they've made him seem think that he was on a reality show but it wasn't
7682900	7689060	actually a reality show we were just fucking with him the entire time but then in the fifth season
7689060	7695060	they did something like it again but they did it with their journals they did the place where they
7695060	7699500	take all the notes they said here's your journals and we're gonna look and they really did it like
7699500	7705180	they got it wrong and the journals all got burned and it was like well they have no more notes but
7705180	7710080	that's different because the journals were just simply for the purposes of you know reviewing
7710080	7714000	notes and stuff like that and I think there was another twist where they had to like they had to
7714000	7719520	give the journal to somebody else so anyway I could I could just do like a podcast for 700
7719520	7725280	episodes about the mole and what a great show it was so if anybody out there has the power to bring
7725280	7729180	the mole back to television you should do it and I will happily host it and I will be as good as
7729180	7733080	Anderson Cooper have you ever found a social media version like you know you play this Facebook
7733080	7740080	reality games thank you for bringing that up no I they did do a version on live journal of the
7740080	7745960	mole I never played it but I watched it and it was you know that as good as it can be for a live
7745960	7750200	journal game but part of the what made the mole really exciting was that they were traveling to
7750200	7754520	all these extravagant locations like I remember the first season ended they did the big reveal
7754520	7758640	and like this giant Coliseum in Spain you know and it was like they were going to all these like
7758640	7762920	crazy-ass location that's what made a very James Bond so and then that's why the celebrity mole
7762920	7768600	was stupid because celebrity mole was like we're in Hawaii or I think the other one was we're in
7768600	7777680	Mexico and like they didn't leave the one little resort they were at it was stupid so anyway act
7777680	7783000	Efton chat says Kai's you know that's what I'm saying let jackpot lick jackbox make it okay
7783000	7788440	Judah says we play games online and the mole has to fuck the team up there you go jackbox I know
7788480	7795520	some of y'all are out there figure out how to get the license to the mole and do it that'd be
7795520	7801640	awesome interview them when they come on the show and ask them about them all right anyway
7801640	7807520	uh let's move on that we got more stories to get into I guess I filled up this week's mailbag
7807520	7812120	segment with discussion on the mole so this is what happens if you don't email us in a future
7812120	7819200	week I I have the right to go on reality TV tangent for 20 minutes all right let's get into
7819200	7824480	some more news we actually did a couple stories and I think we're up to Jamie and your last story
7824480	7835320	here before calls well Sega made one significant sale over the last week in quarter 1 2018 a Sega
7835520	7846520	Game Gear title sold for retail as in it touched a retail POS yes and the game was Sonic the hedgehog
7846520	7856520	2 for Sega Game Gear not aftermarket not eBay not used it sold for fucking retail just like it was
7856520	7864640	1992 so who had Game Gear games on their shelf in 1992 I don't know but they want to find it
7864640	7873800	basically the it came from an NPD group analyst named Matt Piscatella who said that the report
7873800	7879240	came in and now they want to know who the fuck it was Kmart I'm telling you it came from a Kmart
7879240	7887520	it had to be the tweet no it's two tweets someone in the US market bought a brand new copy of Sonic
7887520	7893080	2 for Game Gear at retail in March 2018 I want to know who this person is where they bought it
7893080	7898600	and how it all happened like was it just buried in some back room for the last 20 years did it get
7898600	7904440	lost underneath some retail fixture was it the 20 year old pre-order what was the reaction when
7904440	7911560	the person who bought it saw it so many questions I have it's totally one of those things like you
7911560	7915440	know where they do have that stuff hidden away when they just find it in their back room or
7915440	7920680	something because I've seen like lots of different posts that usually is like a Walmart's like you
7920680	7925080	know they where they kind of go searching for old things and like they'll have you know 56 K
7925080	7931360	modems or you know ridiculous it's a Kmart and are there any that have a diner still check those
7931360	7937440	first no one of the theories is that it's a Toys R Us self I guess that it could be old stock
7937440	7943000	leftover during the liquidation so somebody like like what's behind this door at the Toys R Us oh
7943000	7950400	we don't go back there okay open it what's in there and that's my guy the the timing matches
7950400	7955760	up and the age of it matches up like but wouldn't it when did the Toys R Us liquidation start
7955760	7960480	because this is first couple weeks ago it was in March it was in March and this is a March sale
7961200	7966000	Toys R Us in a few weeks then again no other deals let me see when the announcement for the Toys R
7966000	7969860	Us liquidation so go into something else and I'll research act Defton chat says can we have a
7969860	7975440	reality show for those types of things finding old stuff in retail stores it's called unsolved
7975440	7982560	mysteries that's the theme I should have played that was March 21st is when they announced the
7982560	7989600	start date according to fortune but I'm trying to get the exact day that it began see that's my
7989600	7993200	thing is I don't think the people are saying Toys R Us is the easy answer here but I don't
7993200	7999080	think Toys R Us things started until earlier this month I mean the other thing is like if have they
7999080	8004760	put out the April numbers yet because if it's a big chain and they started really late into March
8004760	8010840	maybe they'll find more reports in April maybe the only it doesn't have the date on it just says
8010840	8016640	that it was going into effect after the 21st of March so it could be a theory I I would still
8016640	8021880	bet money it's a Kmart I mean are there any Kmarts that are having problems like that in
8021880	8029720	closing like all over at they all Oh Sears I wonder if it's a Sears inventory I know Sears
8029720	8034880	got out of the game business a long time ago but Sears are liquidating to aren't they some of them
8034880	8040160	Sears was in the game business back when this game was out I mean I maybe grandma found it at Sears
8040160	8045440	so the other thing is like if it were like a big chain or something I feel like we would see more
8045440	8050200	than just one sale like the fact that it's only one feels weird well they would have destroyed
8050200	8055160	them or returned them like a long time ago or clean the clean anything like one branch like if
8055160	8062000	it's like that it would just be like just write it off it's so old anything else on this Jamie
8062000	8067720	all right it's a collector's item now all right let's move on a couple more stories for you guys
8067720	8071760	and then we're gonna open up the skype line at orange lounge radio on skype okay hopefully this
8071760	8078240	will be end of some of this loot box stuff but Belgium has ruled that loot boxes in certain games
8078240	8084760	are illegal so loot boxes as seen in like FIFA 18 Overwatch counter-strike global offensive are now
8084760	8093600	illegal in Belgium and if you are company is still having those loot boxes in your games you can be
8093600	8099880	subject to criminal punishment including fines up to 800,000 euros which is just under 1 million
8099880	8105480	dollars I'm pretty sure I am prison sentences so I'm pretty sure if it weren't for the prison
8105480	8110560	sentences they probably just take the fine and say fuck it but now they'll have to somehow remove
8110560	8117000	these I would assume or stop selling their game in Belgium and you know they said the Belgium
8117000	8122960	Commission has not contacted us or shared its report and that's from EA we strongly believe
8122960	8127880	that our games are developed and implemented ethically and lawfully around the world and we
8127880	8142280	take these responsibilities very seriously sure EA I totally believe that yeah so I guess they're
8142280	8148120	gonna start a dialogue but I mean it's kind of ironic though that EA would be making a comment
8148120	8152920	about this being that you know the fact that they fucked with Star Wars kind of started this whole
8153160	8161320	avalanche in the first place hmm all right by the way dark to see is shared this in chat apparently
8161320	8167720	the sale for Sonic 2 happened in Wisconsin they know that it was a retail location in Wisconsin
8167720	8172260	I'm telling you it's a Kmart in Wisconsin fascinating yeah we should interview Trixie Mattel
8172260	8179400	and get her local expert feedback on this matter maybe maybe anyway so back to the loot boxes so
8179400	8182720	what's gonna happen it they just gonna pull overwatch out of Belgium so that they don't go
8182760	8187160	to jail I don't know or patch it out or something I would I would I would well they'll probably still
8187160	8191480	continue to have overwatch but they're just you just get the basic skins you don't get any of the
8191480	8197040	extra stuff which would suck because the holiday events aren't gonna be very special yeah I don't
8197040	8200360	know I'd be very curious to see how companies like Blizzard and stuff are gonna respond is or
8200360	8205040	maybe they'll just stop selling the games there I mean it's not like people that want to get the
8205040	8209520	game aren't feel gonna be able to go somewhere else yeah especially in a company like Belgium
8209520	8216240	or in a country like Belgium all right anyhow one more story for you guys it's also something
8216240	8220160	that's gonna impact Blizzard it's something that they had talked about a long time ago in fact I
8220160	8225600	think way back when this game was first announced 2009 Blizzard said that Starcraft 2 would have a
8225600	8232400	map marketplace with the options to buy and sell custom maps well now that it's 2018 nine years
8232400	8239960	later it's finally gonna be a reality so the Starcraft arcade which allows you to create and
8239960	8247040	play custom maps will add a premium fan-made map alongside the next big patch which is version 4.3
8247040	8253280	they say it's very similar to the creation club by Bethesda Blizzard will handpick specific prominent
8253280	8257720	community creators and work with them to create new maps and modes and the share of the sales will
8257720	8262080	go directly to the creators and of course some of it to Blizzard as well for the promotion Blizzard
8262080	8269080	has been applying their help to the first batch of premium maps which include arc star from creator
8269080	8274640	pirate and direct strike from Taya I almost said Tyra but that would be a whole different
8274640	8282160	conversation let's not go there anyhow both these maps will cost $4.99 direct strike will actually
8282160	8287960	have a free and a premium version premium is going to include four new modes and special cosmetics we
8287960	8293360	don't know the patch for Starcraft 2's 4.3 patch we don't the date for it yet but hopefully it's
8293360	8300200	going to be soon and not like next year so there you go that feature now finally coming to Starcraft
8300200	8304640	2 it feels like it's too late for me but at the same time there's still lots of people playing
8304640	8309480	Starcraft and loving Starcraft and the arcade mode was like one of the best things about Starcraft 2
8309480	8314600	so it's interesting that's still going all this years in fact Starcraft 2 went free to play at
8314600	8318760	some point right that was a big thing last year so I mean you can check out the arcade apparently
8318760	8323920	for free so but then of course you can you know buy this stuff if you want as to 100 Matt says
8323920	8328640	they will just make skins tags and so forth level based they will just gain those whenever they
8328640	8333120	level up it will be random like the loot boxes but still encourage the player to keep playing
8333120	8339640	that could be a loophole maybe maybe so as Joe 100 Matt thinks maybe they just won't have you
8339640	8343280	able to buy the loot boxes anymore they'll just cut out that feature and that you'll still have
8343280	8347360	the loot boxes through the natural progression but then how's Blizzard gonna make their money
8347360	8352800	post I mean they could also if they wanted to just patch in a shop and you could just buy the
8352800	8358240	currency and buy whatever and then people be like what the fuck yeah then people will be pissed
8358240	8362320	because Belgium has it and they don't you know I want to buy individual skin yeah so me I think
8362320	8365840	it might probably is in blizzards best interest to either just pull out of Belgium all together
8365840	8372760	or follow what sg100 Matt is suggesting so I mean you may have heard like different games have been
8372760	8376480	like banned in like Germany and stuff so wouldn't be the first time that they haven't sold the game
8376480	8381280	in a certain region like that absolutely all right it's time to open up the Skype line you guys if you
8381280	8386400	want to give us a call orange lounge radio on Skype all one word is the place to do it and as
8386400	8390440	we await your calls I'll check in and see if there's any last-minute stories or other things
8390440	8397440	we want to get to tonight anything from dark soccer or Loki or JD even I haven't seen anything
8397440	8406200	come up it's really slow this week I was a little bit of a news week it is the trickle well because
8406200	8414920	e3 is someone e3 is only about five weeks away so we got to get to this phone call here so let's
8414920	8421840	oh it just went away so I missed it so again orange launch radio all one word on Skype if
8421840	8428480	you want to go ahead and give us a call someone played God of War did it come through oh are you
8428480	8432200	playing God of War nice I haven't oh yeah I watched somebody streaming that hold on we got
8432200	8437200	a call hi you're on orange entree who's this hey it's a regionator hey regent or what's on your
8437200	8444840	mind um I just want to comment on that once draw your you and Loki were talking about earlier
8444840	8451000	where you know some music was being patched out of Grand Theft Auto 4 yeah what about all now here's
8451000	8458440	the thing you know I can see you know don't you know no don't patching know the music out for new
8458440	8465960	sales because license is you know expiring I doubt they want to renew the licenses right but the
8465960	8473640	thing is if you already have the game and the music Senate no I don't see why you should lose
8473640	8481240	access to the music I mean well you know as long as you don't put your game online but no it's a
8481240	8488400	good point like why should you lose access if you already own the game because you know you already
8488400	8491960	pretty much paid for it and they got the money and that all went towards the licensing a long
8491960	8496400	time ago so it is a little weird because you know the way video games used to be you didn't always
8496400	8502480	used to patch games so it is a little a little weird I don't know if the online element is part
8502480	8508560	of the problem is still online but I don't think it's that at all I think it's more of just their
8508560	8512720	current they're still selling it which is why it's an issue and they can't really just patch
8512720	8517200	it out it's not like it's not like games used to be where it's like oh we lost our light rights
8517200	8521000	to the music so we're gonna have different music and all the copies we sell going forward they're
8521000	8530920	still selling digitally yeah no no granted this may not be the best analogy but I kind of like
8530920	8540280	in this to a certain extent to the whole other OS debacle you know from a few years ago where
8540280	8545800	they removed it on PlayStation 3 I remember that yeah I made a lot of people upset yeah I mean you
8545800	8553520	know granted you know the other OS is an actual feature feature you know on the PlayStation 3
8553520	8563240	you know whereas the music is just a mere element within a game but still I mean no no like you
8563240	8571880	guys were saying you know you but you bought the game as it was no music and all and you know I
8571880	8578440	feel that if you they suddenly take this away you know it's not like they're gonna compensate you
8578440	8585280	or anything because they let me get some comments from chat Rama and chat says you don't own the
8585280	8589680	game you own the license to play the game and yeah I know that's always like that little like
8589680	8595040	the footnote or whatever they get you on but at the same time it's like okay if I were to put in
8595040	8600520	DDR max for the PlayStation 2 or something into my PlayStation 2 I wouldn't want to suddenly find
8600520	8604280	out that like oh half the songs I can't play anymore because the license expired you know
8604280	8608880	like I should be able to continue to play those games basically and I've not heard of this
8608880	8614880	happening with especially well I should say non connected music based games yeah connected music
8614880	8619160	based games I have heard of this this happens all the time in DDR arcade sure like they'll just say
8619160	8624120	okay well time's up on the license but it's gonna go away now but it's also usually a new mix you
8624120	8629040	know something else is coming out no I mean it's with EMUs with with the EMUs being mandatory now
8629040	8634920	like ace has had this happen 2013 2014 like all of the newer ones they're just like yeah time's
8634920	8639760	up it's not in anymore it must be something in the way they license music and now right maybe
8639760	8644600	maybe the the takeoff of games like rock band and stuff or to thank for stuff like this I don't know
8644600	8650000	I think it's just the way IP works in the music industry and the way licensing works is just
8650000	8656560	really complicated and it's all in the specifics of the contract in reality if you don't plug your
8656560	8661600	game in online you're never gonna get the patch the patches it out and honestly how long is Grand
8661600	8668280	Theft Auto 4 been out I can't exactly see that they are probably like releasing new content for
8668280	8672000	these games right because Grand Theft Auto 5 already happened so like there's not gonna be
8672000	8675640	you're not gonna miss anything content wise now Grand Theft Auto 4 though still has multiplayer
8675640	8679360	and that's probably gonna be the slippery slope if you want to continue to play multiplayer online
8679360	8685060	you're gonna have to patch the game but if that's of no interest to you then don't patch it and you
8685060	8692940	will get to keep all your music easy all right well you know before I let you go because I
8692940	8699060	reimagine that either act after someone else who would want to call in sure what I do got a tip
8699060	8708140	if it news for you regarding my computer situation I'll make a very long story short it looks like I
8708140	8718100	could be having a video card on the way possibly by Wednesday a friend of mine from high school I
8718100	8722840	don't want a name drop because I don't have his permission to but this is so you can play Magic
8722840	8730620	the Gathering 2018 right well there is no 2018 the most recent one is Magic duels but there's
8730620	8744060	gonna be shipping me his old you know you know GTX 970 so he says he's gonna put a ship in Monday
8744060	8749820	and I'll probably get one say so you'll be able to do a lot with that so hey hand-me-downs they're
8749820	8754660	awesome they work oh oh yeah a 970 would be an upgrade on this computer that's for sure but
8754660	8758500	that's that's for another time all right anyway Ray Jeter I'm gonna let you go thank you so much
8758500	8763620	have a good one yep you too take care all right bye orange on radio all one word on Skype if you
8763620	8769540	want to get through and give us a call let's see SSG 100 Matt says there's a person on Twitter with
8769540	8773780	this whole game gear thing claiming to know the person who bought the game they bought it from a
8773780	8781060	half-price books in Wisconsin a chain of stores there I can't have price but I can't believe I've
8781060	8786820	never bought any video games at a half price we've got one in Roosevelt isn't it a use I just can't
8786820	8791700	they do get some new content in I just can't believe this is like the fucking like like
8791700	8796700	mystery of the century going on here it's just blows my fucking mind all right anyway I think
8796700	8800680	we have another call coming in so let's get to it if Skype will cooperate with me higher on orange
8800680	8805380	launch radio who's this hey what's going on everyone it's Ron hey Rama what's up buddy not
8805380	8811740	much I am running at full cylinders right now so I got you guys on the speakers I'm currently in the
8811740	8817420	chat I got Lightroom going editing photos I got my heater going because even for 56 degrees in
8817420	8822180	New York it's still cold in my little subterranean apartment and I'm going through stuff getting
8822180	8828020	ready for this week's podcast I love it love it were you at a convention this weekend no I did
8828020	8833900	something that was I thought was a lot better the convention is this weekend this weekend was
8833900	8840860	normally or say last weekend whatever it's our Sakura Matsuri but right it costs like 40 bucks
8840860	8847980	to get in we charge you guys yes most Sakura Matsuri events they charge you to get in oh I'm
8847980	8856300	you're on the wrong not not in California these coast ones they charge because what started out
8856300	8862540	as a normal event has become an over glorified convention I mean you pay 40 bucks to go into
8862540	8869300	the Botanical Gardens you've got panels on j-pop j-rock cosplay Lolita okay so this they're doing
8869380	8874140	a convention like a mini convention out of it what's up there's any cosplay yeah there's there's
8874140	8877900	a Sakura Matsuri here and you get to walk in a parade and be afraid there's a lot of free stuff
8877900	8882540	here but to be fair they do like concerts and things around the same time cuz didn't you and
8882540	8888100	um your your pal go to the taiko drum thing and that we didn't know that one though that money
8888100	8893500	goes back into the Taiko group special thing the Northern California cherry blossom festival which
8893500	8899580	was in San Francisco the past two weeks does concerts also yeah so and those are free they
8899580	8904240	have here they're arguing and some pay things but they're the type of thing you you expect to pay
8904240	8909420	money to go to God likes like the food vendors and whatnot yeah that's right anyway sorry no
8909420	8916740	problem I mean yeah that's basically what it's become so instead of doing that I went to it a
8916740	8923260	ramen street festival and dropped $40 there and the food was so good good times that sounds good
8923260	8932780	what'd you get um I had fish ramen I had ultimate um and to ultimate ramen um taste one was called
8932780	8938100	championship ramen and I forget the name of the other one but I did post it on my Facebook but
8938100	8947140	one thing that did happen will make um Jamie squee like nobody else's business more or less please go
8947140	8954020	for it elaborate so I James you know I have a ronma what have hard battle t-shirt that I wear yes
8954020	8959900	so I'm walking around you know filming you know doing a Facebook live with me walking up and down
8959900	8966100	the block and then I see some and I noticed a lot of Japanese workers who came from Japan for this
8966100	8971740	notice the shirt and pointed out I was at one booth and I found myself getting excited because
8971740	8976940	a lot of people there knew the shirt knew the characters I always started singing the opening
8977740	8983020	right there spot that's cute that's awesome yeah I have to quickly say though on ramen since you
8983020	8987660	brought up food my favorite to order when I go to the restaurant is a curry ramen that's always my
8987660	8995740	favorite always black garlic tonkatsu for me but what's interesting so this near where I work here
8995740	9001100	in Sacramento there's been this Chinese restaurant that's been there for years like he's at least 10
9001100	9006380	years probably 15 years it closed kind of out of nowhere and I'm a little sad about it but at the
9006380	9011260	same time a ramen joint is replacing it so I'm kind of like well okay that happened to the pokey
9011260	9017500	place near my house I kind of think pokies overrated I don't know it's nice to have something
9017500	9022580	that I that I can eat yeah no no I understand but pokies becoming like frozen yogurt like there's
9022580	9028220	just too many places it's super trendy it yeah it's replacing I'm not saying we should like eliminate
9028220	9033340	all the poke in the world but it's you know we got to scale it back although speaking of frozen
9033340	9037100	yogurt places you may not have heard this new star sorry to hijack your call Rama but this
9037100	9042860	happens cool uh dark soccer I don't know if you heard about this yogurt land the place that had
9042860	9049100	the Nintendo tie-ins here the one here locally gone it closed that sucks I know it fucking sucks
9049100	9054580	you still have pink bury which you know is the good old OLR standby but we have a new one we
9054580	9058820	relate to like to go to call Menchie's which I think I think they have those oh I think I saw
9058820	9062620	Menchie's when I was traveling so I think they're all over wait wait wait wait wait hold up hold up
9062620	9068900	did you say yogurt land yeah yeah it's a chain we had one out here in lower Manhattan that's been
9068900	9072580	closed for over a year and I never got you has to check it out because they put a sign saying
9072580	9079380	they're renovating next thing you know it's gone yeah I mean we we have a pink berry we have 16
9079380	9084940	handles far as I know the closest Menchie is somewhere out on Long Island but you know yeah
9084940	9089300	that's I just I like the crazy flavors I don't know I got to admit pink berry I'm not as big
9089300	9094180	on it as I used to be because I think a lot of the flavors like every time they get a flavor I
9094180	9099660	really like it never comes back and so I'm I kind of get annoyed by that I don't like how the pink
9099660	9104820	berry doesn't let you do your own toppings now it's like the the killer for me yeah they have
9104820	9110100	some good stuff but I think I think I kind of kind of drifted more towards that you get to make it
9110100	9114780	yourself that's probably Alan's influence Alan never really liked that either Alan was more big
9114780	9119300	on the other do-it-yourself let's not eat it pink berry I got sick but I think it was the Nutella
9119300	9124260	I've got to say though every time we go to Menchie's I just can't stop thinking of the
9124260	9132820	emergency rations in Excel saga all right Rama I have a Menchie hat I know I hijacked your call
9132820	9136380	but anything else you want to share with us tonight before we let you go I will cut down
9136380	9141740	my topics to two all right number one you talked about my space at the beginning of the show yeah
9141740	9147620	there is there is an article that's been floating around about my space about some of the craziness
9147620	9152460	one one of them in there they talk about the top eight there's always a fight about the top eight
9152460	9157260	and I think this was a BuzzFeed article yeah whenever this floats around that top eight I
9157260	9161940	know six of the people on that top eight because I was friends I'm still friends with that person's
9161940	9168700	but that was on myspace yeah I don't even remember who is in my top eight I really don't I feel like
9168700	9173540	olr started around that time so I probably had Janie in the top eight probably Loki if he was
9173540	9181020	even on myspace on you remember I had my music stuff on there oh you sure did I know I had you
9181020	9189880	and she who shall not be named uh-huh um yeah yeah I don't I don't even remember anymore so I I have
9189880	9193260	no idea who is in my top eight I wasn't dating Alan then so he wouldn't have been in the top
9193260	9198220	eight maybe whoever I was taking at the time it was a long time ago but yeah I can't even remember
9198380	9202300	it would be fun to go back and see though because yeah who knows if I'm even still friends with those
9202300	9208100	people as sad as it is I think I deleted mine oh yeah I did too so I wouldn't be able to know well
9208100	9213100	then at some point you were able to expand it to like a top 24 so that's what I did yeah just used
9213100	9217580	to be able to write code inject code in here to make it like your top 100 you know what I think
9217580	9223700	I did I think I made my top eight so that it wasn't so competitive I think I made my top eight like
9223700	9230700	Abba and Alanis Morissette and it was like all the like bands and stuff so I I didn't have to
9230700	9235940	play that ugly rank your friends game Rob forget forget the rest of the topics I want to talk about
9235940	9244500	tonight what's on Abba coming back we haven't I opened up that door didn't I stay tuned to this
9244500	9250220	week shaking and crying and yes there will be a new episode this week but I Lord Jesus I don't
9250300	9254340	want to ruin it but all I will say is that the title is appropriate didn't you just have a
9254340	9262980	musical episode yes yes that's that's all I can say Rama I'm sorry that's cool cuz my first one
9262980	9267800	article I was like oh my god I have to tell her I gotta tell you were the first to put it on my
9267800	9271860	page for what it's worth when I roll that a baby probably you had the East Coast advantage here
9271860	9276140	because when I rolled out of bed it was like Rama shared an article with you and if you were the
9276140	9281420	first to post it and then like it I kid you not that article got posted to my Facebook page at
9281420	9287300	least five times and one of them was Jamie which but but like I think I responded to Jamie's I'm
9287300	9292820	like yeah I woke up saw it yeah no which which again I put I love that I'm getting tied to this
9292820	9298300	all the time but I'm not being sarcastic like I'm actually really touched that people when they
9298300	9303140	think of such a great fucking band like Abba think of me and like want to tell me and share
9303140	9309100	that news so I'm I'm post it five more times to my wall I love it I almost texted it to you that
9309100	9315900	morning and good thing you didn't cuz we're three hours behind you don't forget all right welcome

9320300	9326300	gotten a pass for that news all right Rama I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show but
9326300	9330140	thank you for your call no problem also I got a SNES classic I'm out of here all right bye have
9330140	9336940	fun with it it's a fun system all right oh my god my myspace page is linked on our wiki is it

9355340	9364340	lounge radio on Skype last call Meg Z okay sure um make sense Kristen from work um I love the way
9364340	9374500	you said that my friend Derek who was our Matt and Marissa sorry Rob I thought I had you in my
9374500	9379700	top I deleted my myspace that's right so I may have been in your top eight and I got bounced
9379700	9384420	out when I deleted it I do have a last-minute story all right go for it so the switch has
9384500	9395940	been hacked finally oh so it's been hacked in the craziest part about this hack it's unpatchable so
9395940	9402420	the way it's involves a flaw in the switches Tegra processor their USB recovery mode which
9402420	9408380	can't be patched it just cannot be patched anymore so already two hacking groups have allowed users
9408420	9415700	to jailbreak the switch and even run a ported version of Linux on the system and to actually
9415700	9420580	access it I mean it's like super easy basically create like a little dongle thing that hooks up
9420580	9425340	to the side of it and you can do it actually with a paperclip if you have it formatted just right
9425340	9432820	but it's just so crazy that already we've this has happened and it's unpatchable so it'll be
9432820	9440220	interesting to see what happens from here interesting especially to see whatever they
9440220	9445020	announced next oh my god Jamie is this your own myspace picture that you just linked in chat yep
9445020	9449820	and also I linked another one of you and me on Space Mountain oh Jesus was my old crappy phone
9449820	9455700	so it's all blurry as shit so the so for the sake of our radio people this is a picture of Jamie
9455700	9459300	standing in front of Space Mountain and she's looking happy which of course she would be because
9459300	9464060	she's about to go on fucking that was rockin Space Mountain so that's 2000 fucking six oh shit
9464060	9469020	that was my first trip back to Disneyland and I am like legit screaming on this right this is before
9469020	9474900	we did the poses cuz I'm doing moose ears that was like my first time on Space Mountain in years
9474900	9480700	oh that's awesome and I remembered when cuz to keep in mind I went on that and scream in 24
9480700	9488380	times that year because that was the year that Chris got me a annual pass love it that was so
9488380	9493040	much fun at times that was my first trip back to Disneyland in my adult life it was you me

9503380	9506940	last-minute call coming in so we will take this and then we'll wrap it up hi you're on orange
9506940	9514660	launch radio who's this hey this act up yeah buddy good to hear from you well I have a last
9514700	9521060	minute story for you involving Kirby Star Allies oh yes yes that JD is a fan of this game what
9521060	9531220	would you like to say well they that a mining data mining mines sorry that the bill and basically
9531220	9536780	they found more DLC characters that are coming to the game and it's pretty exciting okay what
9536780	9546180	kind of characters probably two other waves that the first one would be Adeline from Kirby 64 mm-hmm
9546180	9558140	also I forgot the name Oh row road Roach the Roach sorry that Roach from Kirby's quick squat and
9558140	9568460	also Dark Meta Knight too and there's also a third DLC probably with with the gem Bastion
9568460	9578700	the sisters or mages from Kirby Star Allies okay there's also one other Megalor from Kirby return
9578700	9586540	to dreamland and another character which I forgot god damn ah Susie from Kirby planet robot so and
9586540	9591500	also Terenza from Kirby triple deluxe so look forward to all those amiibo coming soon as well
9591500	9599980	yes dark soccer is actually wearing a Kirby shirt tonight and earlier in the show I know you weren't
9599980	9603220	here for the first 30 minutes but be sure to go back and listen to it because I thought dark
9603220	9608340	soccer was telling me about a Kirby drag outfit she was planning but it turns out she said a Kirby
9608340	9613580	and I was like oh act F's gonna be so disappointed I thought it was a Kirby drag outfit you know I
9613580	9618940	could probably put something together I'm pretty handy with some hot glue yes I know I know I'll do
9618940	9623020	a Meta Knight one well that'd be fun so you're enjoying the Kirby of course you're enjoying the
9623020	9631420	Kirby switch game of course I already finished it so I I'm pretty excited about the new content and
9631420	9639180	having more characters though I do wish the game had a little more expansion to it mm-hmm since it's
9639380	9648180	it is kind of short and all that stuff but the game is if if anybody is still considering getting
9648180	9655020	it I really recommend it especially playing with friends yeah that game is so much fun with friends
9655020	9660420	so way too much fun how about that another party game that Nintendo has done successfully yeah
9660420	9665740	that's not a read that's a real like they just always seem to do that I finished the game when
9665740	9669580	I had a bunch of friends over and it was it was a lot of fun but it also made it a lot easier
9669580	9677080	because you can use the special characters and they're super overpowered like the the one guy
9677080	9682140	from Kirby superstar like lets you rain down bomb confetti or something and it just decimated
9682140	9687740	everything it was great yeah marks Marcus is overpowered also gooey it's like really fun to
9687740	9693220	use yeah all right well act after I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up but thank you for the
9693220	9700020	Kirby update hey thanks the inner problem no problem take care buddy all right I think that

9766780	9773220	donuts yay donuts donuts are a thing to get excited about you know we didn't mention this
9773220	9779100	on air but last night we went to that place they do the big puffs here so you actually get like
9779100	9782700	you can get a glazed or a non glazed donut I was like a glazed donut that's too much I got a non
9782700	9787780	glazed donut they put ice cream in it so I got cake batter ice cream in a donut and then they
9787780	9791580	like they like fry it they fuse it together or something they roll it around in toppings and
9791580	9796260	then fuse it together they let you do your choice of like frozen yogurt style toppings like coconut
9796260	9803820	and sprinkles and candy bits I got sprinkles and coconut cream used to have cronuts for their ice
9803860	9809060	cream sandwiches interesting it was pretty epic I think they put them in a panini press yeah I
9809060	9813140	think they put them in a panini press and kind of like reunify the donut but it works it works
