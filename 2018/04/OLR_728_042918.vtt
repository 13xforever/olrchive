00:00.000 --> 00:17.900
This week Microsoft's new Xbox One update allows you to give input control to a mixer

00:17.900 --> 00:18.900
stream viewer.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.940
There are many possible uses for this and personally I'm excited to see them.

00:21.940 --> 00:24.900
That's just one change in store, join us for the rest of the week's gaming news starting

00:24.900 --> 00:29.980
right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:29.980 --> 00:34.540
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back.

00:34.540 --> 00:37.280
It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.280 --> 00:43.500
It's Orange Lounge Radio, back live tonight, April the 29th, 2018, episode number 728 of

00:43.500 --> 00:44.500
our show.

00:44.500 --> 00:50.180
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here in Studio N7, lovely Sacramento, California,

00:50.180 --> 00:53.380
with my co-hosts over there, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:53.380 --> 00:54.380
Hi.

00:54.380 --> 00:55.380
Hi, how are you?

00:55.380 --> 00:56.380
I'm here.

00:56.380 --> 00:57.380
Good.

00:57.380 --> 01:00.980
I'm excited for your DragCon event in two weeks, right?

01:00.980 --> 01:01.980
Two weeks?

01:01.980 --> 01:02.980
I'm ready and nervous.

01:02.980 --> 01:09.020
I've got a lot of stuff to do and some of the things that I ordered are deceptively

01:09.020 --> 01:11.980
not real human body size.

01:11.980 --> 01:15.260
Can we talk about the outfit you were talking about before the show or is that going to

01:15.260 --> 01:16.260
be a secret?

01:16.260 --> 01:17.260
It's fine.

01:17.260 --> 01:20.300
Because it's game related and I love it.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.300
Which one was game related?

01:21.300 --> 01:22.300
The Kirby.

01:22.300 --> 01:25.940
Oh no, I wasn't going to do a Kirby outfit, I was going to do a top hat.

01:25.940 --> 01:26.940
Oh, kind of.

01:26.940 --> 01:28.380
As the hat challenge.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.380
A Kirby.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.500
It's more Drag Race related.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.500
Alright, fine.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.500
Whatever.

01:33.500 --> 01:34.500
I wasn't going to do Kirby at all.

01:34.500 --> 01:35.500
Oh, I thought it was a Kirby.

01:35.500 --> 01:36.500
No.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.500
Oh, a Kirby.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.500
Oh, damn.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.500
I thought that whole time you were going to...

01:39.500 --> 01:41.180
I'm going to do a Kirby top hat.

01:41.180 --> 01:43.180
I thought you were talking about a Kirby.

01:43.180 --> 01:49.180
I mean, I could do a Kirby, Jiggly's already done it I think.

01:49.180 --> 01:50.940
Now you need to do a Jiggly look.

01:50.940 --> 01:57.980
No, if I was going to do one, I would do like a Q-Bone outfit with a skull on my head or

01:57.980 --> 01:58.980
something.

01:58.980 --> 01:59.980
Oh, okay.

01:59.980 --> 02:00.980
I like that.

02:00.980 --> 02:01.980
A little Pokemon.

02:01.980 --> 02:02.980
Yeah.

02:02.980 --> 02:03.980
Alright.

02:03.980 --> 02:04.980
Pokemon, first drag at a ball.

02:04.980 --> 02:05.980
Category is.

02:05.980 --> 02:06.980
Alright.

02:06.980 --> 02:11.420
But no, I have my Shirley Manson inspired outfit.

02:11.420 --> 02:14.340
Hey, Shirley Manson is still awesome.

02:14.340 --> 02:18.460
That's just depending on if I do Sister Face or if I do drag and if I do drag then I bust

02:18.460 --> 02:20.260
out the Shirley Manson wig.

02:20.260 --> 02:21.260
Alright.

02:21.260 --> 02:25.180
Well, looking forward to seeing all that on your social medias in a couple of weeks when

02:25.180 --> 02:26.180
that all goes down.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.180
If I remember, I have one.

02:27.180 --> 02:28.180
Alright.

02:28.180 --> 02:29.180
Also say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.180
Hello.

02:30.180 --> 02:31.180
Hi, Loki.

02:31.180 --> 02:32.180
How are you?

02:32.180 --> 02:33.180
I'm good.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.180
Good.

02:34.180 --> 02:35.180
Have you seen Ready Player One again this week at all?

02:35.180 --> 02:37.580
No, I went and saw two other movies inside.

02:37.580 --> 02:39.580
So I saw Avengers Infinity War.

02:39.580 --> 02:40.580
Of course.

02:40.580 --> 02:41.580
Everybody's seeing Avengers.

02:41.580 --> 02:42.580
I didn't go see it.

02:42.580 --> 02:43.580
I know.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.580
I am so uncool.

02:44.580 --> 02:45.580
I had a migraine last night.

02:45.580 --> 02:46.580
I am so uncool.

02:46.580 --> 02:50.220
And I'm not trying to be like that edgy guy that's like, I'm going to hate the popular

02:50.380 --> 02:51.380
thing.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.380
Dan saw it.

02:52.380 --> 02:56.540
And I, I just, I haven't seen, okay, so like I saw this brilliant post.

02:56.540 --> 02:57.540
It was on Facebook.

02:57.540 --> 02:59.100
I don't see much that's brilliant on Facebook.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.100
It already got spoiled for me.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.580
But it was a, well, don't.

03:01.580 --> 03:02.580
I'm not.

03:02.580 --> 03:03.580
Okay.

03:03.580 --> 03:08.140
Um, but you know, like there's like this flow chart that was like, this is the Marvel universe

03:08.140 --> 03:11.960
and it showed like all these movies and how they're connected and the order it goes.

03:11.960 --> 03:18.060
And I was like, I have seen that one, that one and that one.

03:18.060 --> 03:20.700
It was like four movies on that entire chart I'd seen.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.940
I'm like, I'm not, I still need to see Black Panther.

03:23.940 --> 03:25.820
I've seen all of them, but Black Panthers.

03:25.820 --> 03:29.740
So Oh my God, that's the one, like everybody did see both of the guardians of the galaxy

03:29.740 --> 03:30.740
movies, right?

03:30.740 --> 03:31.740
No.

03:31.740 --> 03:32.740
Okay.

03:32.740 --> 03:33.740
I'm kidnapping you.

03:33.740 --> 03:34.740
I am the uncoolest.

03:34.740 --> 03:36.300
I know the guardians of galaxy movies are the best.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.920
It's on Netflix, dude.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.920
Is it the second one?

03:38.920 --> 03:43.340
All right, well, well, I've got the Blu-rays anyways, but I want to play video games.

03:43.340 --> 03:44.340
I don't have time for movies.

03:44.340 --> 03:45.340
Okay.

03:45.340 --> 03:46.340
Do it.

03:46.340 --> 03:47.580
I do play them while you're watching the movie.

03:47.580 --> 03:48.580
How was the other one?

03:48.580 --> 03:49.580
The Quiet Place?

03:49.580 --> 03:52.760
Cause I'd go see that because you don't need to see other movies first.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.060
The Quiet Place is good.

03:54.060 --> 04:00.820
Um, it was just a really intense, you know, edge of your seat horror movie, I guess.

04:00.820 --> 04:07.340
Um, I can see, I heard a rumor that at one time they were trying to do that stupid nonsense

04:07.340 --> 04:12.380
where, Oh, Hey, let's take these random movies and make them part of the Cloverfield universe.

04:12.380 --> 04:18.900
And I could see how that could sort of be part of the Cloverfield universe in a very,

04:18.900 --> 04:22.780
we're really stretching to see the connection here, but do you know what weird thing I read

04:22.780 --> 04:23.780
this week?

04:23.780 --> 04:27.260
And I don't even remember where maybe somebody in our chat room knows over at live.vognetwork.com

04:27.260 --> 04:31.380
because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network, vognetwork.com

04:31.380 --> 04:35.060
six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black Wolf show.

04:35.060 --> 04:38.760
Although Bobby is on a little brief hiatus while he takes care of some other things.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.300
So wishing Bobby well.

04:40.340 --> 04:44.380
Um, but anyway, uh, so we are live, so join our chat room unless you're listening on the

04:44.380 --> 04:45.380
podcast.

04:45.380 --> 04:47.940
Then, um, you can go see the chat rooms open 24 seven.

04:47.940 --> 04:52.300
There just might not be anybody there, but anyway, uh, where was I dang it, I was gonna

04:52.300 --> 04:53.300
Cloverfield.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.300
Oh yes.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.300
Okay.

04:55.300 --> 04:59.540
So did you read the thing online about how the Tomb Raider movie, there was a proposal

04:59.540 --> 05:07.180
that that would be in the same universe as just cause hit man, um, all the other stuff

05:07.180 --> 05:13.280
that like they want to turn into movies from like American game studios specifically I'd

05:13.280 --> 05:18.680
asked fine with it, but I like, how would that cross over though, Laura Croft and hit

05:18.680 --> 05:25.740
man and like they all, I don't know, but that would be an awesome, awesome to do what exactly

05:25.740 --> 05:28.220
I regal Rodriguez in, you know, Laura Croft.

05:28.220 --> 05:33.260
I'm down, I'm down for just a just cause movie, honestly, because that's gonna be batshit

05:33.260 --> 05:34.260
insane.

05:34.260 --> 05:35.260
You gotta have Jason Statham.

05:35.380 --> 05:41.260
That's totally un, you know, not going to match the nationality of the main character

05:41.260 --> 05:42.260
at all.

05:42.260 --> 05:46.240
But I just see something like that has to be as crazy as like one of the crank movies

05:46.240 --> 05:47.240
or something.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.240
Right.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.060
But yeah, I'm down with something like that.

05:50.060 --> 05:54.740
I just, I haven't watched any of the hitman movies, so I don't really know how those would

05:54.740 --> 05:56.460
really play into it, but sure.

05:56.460 --> 05:57.460
Why not?

05:57.460 --> 05:58.700
Everyone's wants to make a cinematic universe.

05:58.700 --> 06:03.180
Uh, let's see tiger call out chat over at live.vog network.com says a video game cinematic

06:03.180 --> 06:04.180
universe.

06:04.180 --> 06:09.300
I'm not going to have that with ready player one kind of that's a stretch.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.300
That's a stretch.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.300
Anyway.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.300
All right.

06:12.300 --> 06:13.300
Uh, let's see.

06:13.300 --> 06:14.300
So, okay.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.300
Uh, something else I have to address with you.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.300
Well, let me come back.

06:16.300 --> 06:17.300
Cause I have to introduce, we have a guest in studio.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.840
We always want to say hello to our guests because we haven't had a guest in studio in

06:19.840 --> 06:23.580
like a long time, but, uh, we have an old fave back here on the show this week.

06:23.580 --> 06:27.300
Say hello to longtime music, game, fan, lover, et cetera.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.300
JD.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.300
Hey.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.300
Hi.

06:30.300 --> 06:31.300
How are you?

06:31.300 --> 06:32.300
I'm doing pretty well.

06:32.300 --> 06:33.300
Yeah.

06:33.420 --> 06:38.620
Um, I mean, not much any movies.

06:38.620 --> 06:39.620
Oh yeah.

06:39.620 --> 06:42.300
I saw a game night a couple of weeks ago.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.300
Okay.

06:43.300 --> 06:44.300
That's like board game night.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.300
Right?

06:45.300 --> 06:46.300
Yeah.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.740
I mean, it's a thriller about board games and a friend group.

06:47.740 --> 06:48.740
Like it's pretty fun.

06:48.740 --> 06:49.740
I didn't know that's a thriller.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.060
I thought it was a comedy.

06:52.060 --> 06:53.060
It's a comedy thriller.

06:53.060 --> 06:56.060
Oh, cause I was like, Oh, so like scream.

06:56.060 --> 06:57.060
Yeah.

06:57.060 --> 07:01.220
Or, or well more like, like scream three that when they started getting a little more batshit,

07:01.220 --> 07:02.780
I've only seen the first one.

07:02.780 --> 07:06.700
Oh, well you're not missing much.

07:06.700 --> 07:10.540
Scream two and three are like, okay, they're, they're worth your time, but not when you're

07:10.540 --> 07:12.500
behind on 70,000 Marvel movies.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.500
Like I am.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.500
All right.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.500
Yeah.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.500
I've been like, nothing's new in my life.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.500
Okay.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.500
That's cool.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.500
Uh, but you're, you're doing more Pokemon go.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.500
We had fun playing that.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.500
Yeah.

07:21.500 --> 07:22.500
Right.

07:22.500 --> 07:23.500
Yeah.

07:23.500 --> 07:24.500
Yeah.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.500
It comes in and goes like when there's events, I'll log in and when there's not, you know,

07:25.500 --> 07:26.980
but we'll cover that on my gaming week.

07:26.980 --> 07:27.980
Okay.

07:27.980 --> 07:31.400
Cause I was going to say he's downplaying it just a little bit because this whole weekend

07:31.400 --> 07:35.320
as we've been going around from place to place, it'll be like, Ooh, Wailmer, Ooh, Magikarp,

07:35.320 --> 07:36.320
Ooh, Wailmer.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.040
Well, see, I have a lot of catching up to do cause I don't play all the time.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.040
I understand.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.040
I understand.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.720
That's the great thing about these events though, is that they allow you to catch up.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.720
Right.

07:43.720 --> 07:44.720
All right.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.960
Well, we'll come back to you during your gaming week then and get the full pogo story, but

07:46.960 --> 07:47.960
let's go to Loki.

07:47.960 --> 07:51.720
Um, before we get to the kickoff topic, I think this is worth addressing because you've

07:51.720 --> 07:54.460
been alluding to this on social media.

07:54.460 --> 07:57.800
And then you came in here tonight and said, Rob, I need to borrow some of your amiibo.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.800
I'm not borrowing.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.320
I have it with me.

08:00.320 --> 08:04.160
So I know, I know, but that's like, you're, you're borrowing it for five seconds.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.760
You're not like longterm borrowing it.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.480
But then I kind of went click, click, click, wait a minute.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.080
There was a photo of his kid playing a switch.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.240
Did you finally buy Nintendo switch?

08:13.240 --> 08:18.560
Yes, we, we traded in the Wii U system that you got me a while back and how could you

08:18.560 --> 08:19.560
trade a gift?

08:19.560 --> 08:20.560
No, I'm kidding.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.560
It's totally cool.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.560
That's, that's what happens in gaming.

08:22.560 --> 08:27.040
Well, I didn't want to, but the, the rule is my wife, wife said you have to get rid

08:27.040 --> 08:28.640
of something in order to get something new.

08:28.640 --> 08:32.400
So it's a worthy upgrade and it is it.

08:32.400 --> 08:38.480
It's bittersweet, I guess, because my son, he really, really wanted to switch, but at

08:38.480 --> 08:43.800
the same time he's like, Oh, I, I'm playing through super Mario three D world right now.

08:43.800 --> 08:45.680
And it's like, I'm almost finished with it.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.720
I'm like, well, you sure you want to get switched in?

08:47.720 --> 08:49.480
We can, you know, do this another time.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.480
No, no, no.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.480
I want to get switched.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.480
And then we got switched.

08:52.480 --> 08:56.280
He's like, man, I kind of wish we didn't get a switch cause I wanted to play there, but,

08:56.280 --> 09:01.400
yeah, he's been playing nonstop, you know, Mario Odyssey and always focus on that one.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.720
So we got a switch and, um, did all that.

09:03.720 --> 09:08.160
But so I just, I just want the Nintendo fans who, who all Loki sometimes ruffles their

09:08.160 --> 09:09.160
feathers.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.120
I just want the date and time noted.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.000
Loki is finally on board with a switch.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
There we go.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Yeah.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.560
So now I can hate on it, you know, you know, from firsthand experience on it with, uh,

09:21.560 --> 09:26.240
with, uh, like seriously, like when the e-shop, like, geez.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.560
Way to put no effort into that interface.

09:29.560 --> 09:34.120
Like that's even less interface or less effort into an interface than there was on the Wii.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.520
I mean, it's ridiculous.

09:35.520 --> 09:39.560
Oh, dark Tetsuya in chat says, I got a request from Loki on my system.

09:39.560 --> 09:42.880
Wondering if I should do the same since I don't even use my Wii U anymore.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.880
Oh, I guess I should log into my switch and see if Loki sent me a friend request.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.880
I didn't because you're not linked to Facebook or Twitter.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.880
So apparently not.

09:50.880 --> 09:54.340
I unlinked all of that stuff on purpose though.

09:54.340 --> 09:58.140
So I just haven't bothered to go out and share the friend code that I have.

09:58.140 --> 10:01.940
Um, I just was really quickly going through and just doing it through the system.

10:01.940 --> 10:05.180
I'm like, okay, we'll see if this is all linked together and everything.

10:05.180 --> 10:06.460
So I did all that.

10:06.460 --> 10:07.460
Yeah.

10:07.460 --> 10:10.580
Dungeon buster in chat says Loki now has authoritative Nintendo hate.

10:10.580 --> 10:11.960
Oh, absolutely.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.860
So I hate because I love, that's right.

10:13.860 --> 10:14.860
What games?

10:14.860 --> 10:15.860
Yeah.

10:15.860 --> 10:16.860
You're the Tyra Banks of the show.

10:16.860 --> 10:19.840
What was the, um, what was the, uh, games you got?

10:19.840 --> 10:22.340
You said Mario Odyssey, Mario Odyssey and Mario Kart 8.

10:22.340 --> 10:23.340
Mario Kart 8.

10:23.340 --> 10:24.340
I like the two.

10:24.340 --> 10:25.340
No Zelda yet.

10:25.340 --> 10:27.580
No, because I didn't play, you had Zelda on the Wii U.

10:27.580 --> 10:31.460
I had, well, I didn't play it on the Wii U and that's, I didn't play it very much.

10:31.460 --> 10:32.460
Okay.

10:32.460 --> 10:35.580
You know, so I will get Zelda at one point, but I'm like, I'm not gonna buy another game.

10:35.580 --> 10:37.140
I'm not going to get to right away.

10:37.140 --> 10:38.460
I'll pick it up later.

10:38.460 --> 10:40.560
Um, I'm in no hurry yet.

10:40.560 --> 10:48.000
We have a, I bought a 128 gigabyte memory card, so I'm just gonna download stuff as

10:48.000 --> 10:52.540
I feel like it, but I just, I know I'm not going to get to Zelda right now, so I'm not

10:52.540 --> 10:56.500
going to buy it right now because it, I mean, all those accessories and everything are so

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
expensive.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.980
Nintendo stuff like never goes on sale either.

10:59.980 --> 11:03.460
Like you're still, you're still going to pay 60 bucks for Zelda, right?

11:03.460 --> 11:06.980
And I'm not, you know, I'm not worried about that, but I'm just saying I don't want to

11:06.980 --> 11:10.580
pick it up right now because I'm not going to get to it right now.

11:10.580 --> 11:15.040
I'll just play through Mario Odyssey for now and then all the other games on the other

11:15.040 --> 11:18.380
systems I have and oh shit, there's my scene backlog.

11:18.380 --> 11:21.080
You know, it's like there's too much.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.400
What about Splatoon?

11:22.400 --> 11:23.400
I don't like Splatoon.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.400
Okay.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.460
I mean, I bought the first Splatoon and I was like, oh yeah, it's gonna be awesome.

11:27.460 --> 11:28.460
I never played it.

11:28.460 --> 11:30.640
I'll lend you my copy of Arms.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.080
I know that really does not look good.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.880
The kids will think it's fun though.

11:34.880 --> 11:35.880
That's a good point.

11:35.880 --> 11:36.880
Let the kids try it.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.640
I mean, they might like that, but like, and then that's a problem because they don't have

11:39.640 --> 11:40.640
to buy it.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.640
Well, no, not really.

11:41.640 --> 11:42.640
I mean, it's Splatoon.

11:42.640 --> 11:45.000
It's just like, I just don't think I'll play it.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.520
I mean, that's a problem.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.560
How about Smash Brothers this holiday?

11:48.560 --> 11:50.360
I'll pick, I'll pick up Smash Brothers when it comes out.

11:50.360 --> 11:51.360
That's a must have.

11:51.360 --> 11:55.880
I like Smash Brothers, but like, I just didn't want, like, and I even thought about Splatoon

11:55.880 --> 11:58.680
2 and like, no, I didn't play the first one.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.640
I just didn't really get into it.

12:01.640 --> 12:06.040
Over in chat at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, is there an Arms demo Loki can

12:06.040 --> 12:07.040
try?

12:07.040 --> 12:10.880
They had a test fire or whatever they called it, an Arms fire or whatever they called that

12:10.880 --> 12:11.880
thing.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.080
They have demos for some things and I may pick those up.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.880
They had one previously, but isn't there, wouldn't there supposed to be more Arms like

12:15.880 --> 12:18.320
for some reason, like coming up in the coming weeks?

12:18.320 --> 12:20.960
Like maybe they're trying to get more people to buy Arms.

12:20.960 --> 12:21.960
I don't know.

12:21.960 --> 12:25.080
I believe they had a free weekend a couple of weeks ago and they've been doing it every

12:25.080 --> 12:26.080
so often.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.080
They're already passed.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.080
I'll check it out when it's free.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.240
I mean, it just didn't look very interesting.

12:29.240 --> 12:34.200
I'm very disappointed and I mean, I know a lot of people have shared this complaint,

12:34.200 --> 12:38.080
but like one of the things like I brought when I got in the system was like, it would

12:38.080 --> 12:41.120
have been nice to be able to pick up all those virtual console games I had already.

12:41.120 --> 12:44.520
They're literally losing out money because I would have dropped money for all those games

12:44.520 --> 12:45.520
they have in there.

12:45.520 --> 12:48.040
You know, like Mario 64, that was the other game that he was playing through.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.200
He was playing through Mario 64.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.960
I would have downloaded Mario 64 again.

12:50.960 --> 12:55.840
I would have paid the full $10 or whatever the fucking ridiculous price for virtual console

12:55.840 --> 12:57.640
game again, but they didn't have it available.

12:57.640 --> 13:00.760
So they're literally losing money because of that.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.200
So guess what I'm going to have to do instead?

13:02.200 --> 13:04.520
I'm just saying they put it on emulator.

13:04.520 --> 13:10.080
So sorry Nintendo, you had an opportunity to get much more money from me, but because

13:10.080 --> 13:13.760
of whatever bullshit excuse you're going to use, you didn't.

13:13.760 --> 13:18.160
Well, we have some news coming up later in the show that maybe we'll finally get word

13:18.160 --> 13:22.440
on what's happening on Mario 64 and the other virtual console stuff, but we will get to

13:22.440 --> 13:24.000
that later in the show.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.720
Let's jump into our kickoff topic tonight, which actually has nothing to do with Nintendo

13:27.720 --> 13:28.720
and our gaming weeks.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.720
Yes, of course.

13:29.720 --> 13:30.720
Our gaming weeks as well.

13:30.720 --> 13:34.060
We'll start with our kickoff topic as we usually do here at the top of the show, which has

13:34.060 --> 13:36.240
to do not with Nintendo, but with Microsoft.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.240
Right?

13:37.240 --> 13:38.240
Yeah.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.600
So Microsoft and discord are, I guess, teaming up.

13:40.600 --> 13:45.720
And so they have this, um, Xbox heart discord thing where you can link your account, sync

13:45.720 --> 13:49.280
your friends, and I guess, um, display which games you're playing.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.840
I don't want to sync my friends.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.560
I like them.

13:52.560 --> 13:58.860
So yeah, you can do that on PC and console and, um, it's interesting.

13:58.860 --> 14:04.400
So how it works is it doesn't sound like it's much like, it's not like Xbox live is suddenly

14:04.400 --> 14:09.540
integrating discord chattery that it's just like, uh, it's like how discord, uh, integrated

14:09.580 --> 14:11.100
Spotify not that long ago.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.540
You can see what people are listening to on Spotify, but that's it.

14:13.540 --> 14:14.540
It's just their little stuff.

14:14.540 --> 14:17.380
Maybe you can share stuff to it because they have a basic lens, the same.

14:17.380 --> 14:20.060
It's linking like a social media account.

14:20.060 --> 14:24.180
So like Facebook and Twitter, so you can like maybe post to it, you know, Hey, I just got

14:24.180 --> 14:25.180
this achievement or something.

14:25.180 --> 14:26.180
Yeah.

14:26.180 --> 14:27.180
Then maybe, maybe you'll be able to do things like that.

14:27.180 --> 14:31.040
But I think also like if you look on the sidebar, like, you know, cause, cause vog network has

14:31.040 --> 14:33.100
a discord, cheap plug, cheap plug.

14:33.100 --> 14:37.060
And so you'll see me on that discord and you can actually see what games I'm like as I,

14:37.060 --> 14:39.640
I let it post, it's not a big deal.

14:39.640 --> 14:44.340
You can actually see when I'm playing stuff on PC, you can see that, you know, Rob Roberts

14:44.340 --> 14:48.880
is currently playing Diablo three, which has been a lot this week if, if I'm playing it

14:48.880 --> 14:49.880
on PC.

14:49.880 --> 14:53.200
But if I'm playing these on console, like if I'm playing DJ max on PlayStation four,

14:53.200 --> 14:57.140
you don't see that on discord because the PlayStation doesn't talk to discord.

14:57.140 --> 14:59.540
But now Microsoft will do that.

14:59.540 --> 15:03.780
It sounds like, so you'll be able to see Rob Roberts is playing, I don't know, what do

15:03.780 --> 15:05.300
I play on Xbox one anymore?

15:05.740 --> 15:09.500
What was I was playing the Gianna sisters game this week to spoil my, my gaming week

15:09.500 --> 15:10.500
a little bit.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.740
So let's say Rob Roberts is playing Gianna sisters, twisted dreams or whatever.

15:13.740 --> 15:17.180
And so maybe you decide, Oh, I want to join him in that game.

15:17.180 --> 15:20.900
You could, you would know from your desktop discord or even your mobile that, Oh, Rob's

15:20.900 --> 15:22.260
playing Gianna sisters.

15:22.260 --> 15:24.820
I could jump in and join him right now or whatever it is on Xbox.

15:24.820 --> 15:29.260
I mean, that's a neat for a lot of people I'm sure, right?

15:29.260 --> 15:33.740
So yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm into this idea, but I mean it, it doesn't sound like it's

15:33.740 --> 15:35.280
this gigantic Alliance.

15:35.280 --> 15:39.120
It's just, Oh, discord is going to show your Xbox activity now.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.120
Cool.

15:40.120 --> 15:44.040
But it's still kind of like, this is a nice little foot in the door for Microsoft because

15:44.040 --> 15:48.040
I think discord is one of those things in gaming and kind of what I wanted to talk about

15:48.040 --> 15:50.240
here a little bit at the top of the show.

15:50.240 --> 15:54.400
Discord's really been blowing up and gaming like, you know, nobody knew what discord was

15:54.400 --> 15:59.400
what like two months ago or I'm sorry, not too much, two years ago.

15:59.400 --> 16:06.540
Discord basically took the concept of chat and especially like team speak servers that

16:06.540 --> 16:07.880
people were paying money for.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.760
I think that's the big thing and made it free.

16:10.760 --> 16:14.680
I'm not completely sure how discord is making enough money to keep those servers afloat.

16:14.680 --> 16:18.160
I know they sell their premium subscriptions and things like that, but I don't know how

16:18.160 --> 16:21.080
many people are actually buying those cause you can create servers for free.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.680
There's a lot of conspiracy thoughts about like what discord might be doing with your

16:24.680 --> 16:25.680
data.

16:25.680 --> 16:29.360
Oh, they might be selling the play data or something or who knows, but like it's, it's

16:29.360 --> 16:32.920
a Facebook kind of situation where it's like, well, if you don't, if you're not paying for

16:32.920 --> 16:34.080
it, you are the product.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.080
Yeah.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.080
Yeah.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.080
So, so who knows?

16:37.080 --> 16:40.640
But anyway, uh, discord's like blown up and I think especially you got two big things

16:40.640 --> 16:42.920
to thank for discord blown up.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.760
One of them is Pokemon go.

16:44.760 --> 16:49.360
Like I, I mean, I know not everybody out there plays Pokemon go, but if you do play Pokemon

16:49.360 --> 16:54.120
go because there is no chat within Pokemon go and this rating thing is such a big deal

16:54.120 --> 16:55.880
and you've got to find other people to raid with.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.680
Like discord has really taken over for Pokemon go.

16:58.680 --> 17:02.300
That's how you find out where raids are and know when people are going to be there.

17:02.300 --> 17:06.160
And I think so many people that necessarily wouldn't even necessarily play other games

17:06.160 --> 17:09.440
because you know, there's plenty of people out there who play Pokemon go and don't play

17:09.440 --> 17:14.200
other games, I think are getting exposed to discord and all of this stuff.

17:14.200 --> 17:19.080
And then I think the other big thing that has really caused discord to blow up is Nintendo

17:19.080 --> 17:22.080
because Nintendo doesn't really have an online solution.

17:22.080 --> 17:24.880
A lot of people are going to discord to do their chats.

17:24.880 --> 17:28.960
I mean, granted, there's, there's other stuff too, like MMOs, like all the people that were

17:28.960 --> 17:36.080
using TeamSpeak before, like to do their raids, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy, Guild Wars,

17:36.080 --> 17:37.720
all those MMOs online.

17:37.720 --> 17:42.560
You know, why would people pay for a TeamSpeak server when you just go to their discord now?

17:42.560 --> 17:48.120
So you know, discord is really, I think, wedge their foot in the door with all these different,

17:48.120 --> 17:49.120
different things.

17:49.120 --> 17:52.560
And so I think it's, it's really kind of transformed in some ways, a lot of the gaming stuff.

17:52.560 --> 17:57.400
So it's interesting that discord is continuing to be like one unified kind of gaming ecosystem

17:57.400 --> 18:01.840
instead of like Xbox Live being in their own bubble and PlayStation being in their own

18:01.840 --> 18:02.840
bubble and so forth.

18:02.840 --> 18:08.280
Because if you use discord, you can chat to anybody playing anything because the fact

18:08.280 --> 18:09.800
that it's mobile is a big deal.

18:09.800 --> 18:10.800
Yeah.

18:10.800 --> 18:16.000
Uh, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Tiger Claw says, indeed, you can start your

18:16.000 --> 18:19.120
own community in discord, which is what we did at VOG network.

18:19.120 --> 18:23.880
And if you want to join our discord, you can over at vognetwork.com slash discord,

18:23.880 --> 18:25.120
and that will just give you the invite.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.320
You don't have to worry about an invite code because it'll just put it right in there for

18:28.320 --> 18:29.320
you.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.320
So we, uh, we, we want anybody to join.

18:32.320 --> 18:36.560
Um, well, as long as you're not a dick, that's the general rule, right?

18:36.560 --> 18:41.160
As Joan Hunter-Matt says, I'm worried someone will buy discord sometime soon and turn it

18:41.160 --> 18:44.280
into an exclusivicity war.

18:44.280 --> 18:48.760
Um, perhaps Microsoft would be a worthy suitor, huh?

18:48.760 --> 18:53.320
However, blueberry follows that up in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, discord

18:53.320 --> 18:56.020
has denied buyouts several times.

18:56.020 --> 19:02.280
So anyway, uh, and Tiger Claw also points out the great thing about discord is you can

19:02.280 --> 19:04.240
connect to multiple servers at once.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.240
Oh, absolutely.

19:05.240 --> 19:10.080
I mean, obviously I have the VOG network one, but I'm probably on like 10 different servers.

19:10.080 --> 19:14.520
Uh, and that's, I think that's small fry compared to a lot of people I've heard of some people

19:14.520 --> 19:15.520
that have filled it up.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.080
Like guys, I think you can only be on like a hundred different servers.

19:18.400 --> 19:22.640
Yeah, I haven't really messed with discord too much, but it seems interesting.

19:22.640 --> 19:23.640
Yeah.

19:23.640 --> 19:27.400
How do you even with a hundred servers, like who has time for that?

19:27.400 --> 19:31.120
Well, I think some of them are more like, like it seems like everybody starts their

19:31.120 --> 19:32.120
own server.

19:32.120 --> 19:35.720
I think if you're like a Twitch person, all the Twitch people you follow probably have

19:35.720 --> 19:37.120
their own servers.

19:37.120 --> 19:43.180
Um, I decided to buy in more to the idea of together we are stronger, which is why I throw

19:43.180 --> 19:44.180
all my Twitch.

19:44.300 --> 19:49.100
Even though I do broadcast on Twitch instead of using my own server, which I started one,

19:49.100 --> 19:52.180
but like the only people in it are Alan and I, because I was like, you know what, I'm

19:52.180 --> 19:56.560
going to throw my, my w whatever weight this is, it's not much weight, but, uh, behind

19:56.560 --> 20:00.720
the VOG server, you know, to try to get more people in one place type of thing.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.220
But I know a lot of Twitch streamers will have their own servers.

20:03.220 --> 20:08.940
Um, plus a lot of like, I have two for Pokemon go cause I have Pokemon go for the Sacramento

20:08.940 --> 20:13.780
area, but then they also have an X-rays server dedicated to the, the, um, you too.

20:13.780 --> 20:18.460
I always say Meowth raids with the Mewtwo raids that happened with, um, uh, Pokemon

20:18.460 --> 20:19.460
go.

20:19.460 --> 20:20.820
So I have two just for that.

20:20.820 --> 20:25.900
And then I have like a, when I was playing Warcraft for a hot minute, I was in a Warcraft

20:25.900 --> 20:27.500
Guild chat.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.220
I was, I'm still in a final fantasy 14.

20:30.220 --> 20:32.720
I'm in like two or three final fantasy 14 ones.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.020
So it's just that caps out at maybe 15 though.

20:35.020 --> 20:38.460
Like I'm talking like you have a hundred, how do you keep up with all of that?

20:38.460 --> 20:39.460
It's a lot.

20:39.460 --> 20:40.460
So overwhelmed.

20:40.460 --> 20:41.460
It is a lot.

20:41.460 --> 20:42.460
It's a lot.

20:42.500 --> 20:48.540
Live.vognetwork.com dark Tetsuya says, I do have some of the Twitch folks I follow also

20:48.540 --> 20:50.180
follow their discords.

20:50.180 --> 20:54.460
There's always discussion going on, or they also have image boards or places to share

20:54.460 --> 20:55.460
music.

20:55.460 --> 20:56.460
Good point.

20:56.460 --> 21:00.300
Uh, Rama on the whole Microsoft and discord thing says, no, Microsoft is still working

21:00.300 --> 21:01.340
on Skype.

21:01.340 --> 21:05.900
They're shutting down Skype for business and merging it into Microsoft teams.

21:05.900 --> 21:13.020
It's Slack's competitor, which well, discord is kind of like Slack in a way, but with the

21:13.020 --> 21:15.820
team speak element and all that.

21:15.820 --> 21:20.100
I wouldn't really say discord is Slack's competitor, even though they're very similar services

21:20.100 --> 21:27.540
because Slack is extremely aimed at businesses and Microsoft teams is also going after businesses.

21:27.540 --> 21:30.300
Discord is not going for the professional users.

21:30.300 --> 21:31.300
Okay.

21:31.300 --> 21:33.040
But like, here's, here's the funny thing.

21:33.080 --> 21:41.040
So when it comes to Slack, I am in probably 12 different Slacks, 11 of them are ingress

21:41.040 --> 21:42.040
related.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.040
Oh yeah.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.040
Yeah.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.520
Like I think ingress got on Slack because Slack was out before discord.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.720
I think, I think it's exactly what it is because there's been that talk about should, should

21:49.720 --> 21:51.560
we be using discord as an ingress thing?

21:51.560 --> 21:55.200
But the problem is now all this customization has been done for Slack.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.320
People want to get off of it.

21:56.320 --> 22:01.600
Well, I mean, I have both Slack and discord and I like Slack a lot better, but so like,

22:01.600 --> 22:05.800
I feel like people who are used to Slack don't want to switch over to discord because

22:05.800 --> 22:09.720
they feel very different, but right now I hear that.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.900
But Slack also like misses certain features.

22:11.900 --> 22:15.160
Make sure you're nice and in that microphone cause you're being very quiet right now.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.160
Sorry.

22:16.160 --> 22:21.320
Slack is missing specific gaming related features like ignoring people, you know, because it's,

22:21.320 --> 22:23.520
Oh, well it's a business tool, right?

22:23.520 --> 22:25.920
Which is a whole other argument that we don't need to get into.

22:25.920 --> 22:26.920
What?

22:26.920 --> 22:29.200
I can't ignore my coworkers?

22:29.200 --> 22:34.980
But what's funny to me is that we've never used Slack in my work environments.

22:34.980 --> 22:39.960
Now granted, I've historically worked in healthcare and I would imagine using Slack and their

22:39.960 --> 22:44.200
servers is probably not good for HIPAA and those types of losses probably why I did Slack

22:44.200 --> 22:45.200
is never really.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.200
Yep.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.200
I don't know.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.840
Then maybe they do have the high encryption, but for whatever reason, the companies I've

22:48.840 --> 22:49.840
worked for don't use it.

22:49.840 --> 22:54.040
We use some type of instant messaging that's in house.

22:54.040 --> 22:58.720
Doesn't Salesforce have their own like group message thing cause it's shit.

22:59.240 --> 23:05.640
It's Salesforce, so yes, but no, the, my point is like a lot of companies are like, Oh, we're

23:05.640 --> 23:07.440
already in on this one thing.

23:07.440 --> 23:08.880
We'll just use whatever chat I guess.

23:08.880 --> 23:12.280
If you're talking about like chatter, then that is shit.

23:12.280 --> 23:17.520
But no, my knowledge of Salesforce is very small, but like for what my company uses for,

23:17.520 --> 23:18.520
it's great.

23:18.520 --> 23:24.080
But we use, I think we're using like one tiny branch of this huge mungus tree.

23:24.080 --> 23:27.960
So and they have so many ways because of my Salesforce, it could be something that we

23:27.960 --> 23:32.800
just don't use, which is very, very, very possible.

23:32.800 --> 23:33.800
True.

23:33.800 --> 23:38.320
Uh, looking at chat over at live.voggenower.com, Tiger cloud points out a great thing about

23:38.320 --> 23:41.960
discord is you can use it anywhere since you can use the mobile app.

23:41.960 --> 23:45.400
You can even use voice chat on the mobile app, post pics from your phone.

23:45.400 --> 23:51.800
I think that is a big part about why discord has succeeded in such a big way too is because

23:51.800 --> 23:52.800
of that.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.920
You know, like who doesn't have a smartphone in this day and age, right?

23:55.920 --> 23:58.080
No, RageNator finally got a smartphone.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.940
So I mean like, oh, and Daniel Day Lewis still uses a flip phone.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.160
We saw that on social media.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.160
Okay.

24:04.160 --> 24:07.240
But most like 99% of people have smartphones at this point.

24:07.240 --> 24:12.200
So uh, when it comes to the smartphones, like, you know, you, you're gaming on your console.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.400
It's very easy to just have your smartphone right there with your little earbud in or

24:16.400 --> 24:17.680
just even on speaker or whatever.

24:17.680 --> 24:22.480
It's like you have this chat device with you even when Nintendo doesn't have anything.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.600
Although those features are not exclusive to discord.

24:24.600 --> 24:28.420
Like the Slack app also has, you can upload pictures, you can do voice calls, like all

24:28.420 --> 24:29.420
sorts of things.

24:29.420 --> 24:32.920
Like I'm not trying to like say one or the other, I'm just saying these are common features.

24:32.920 --> 24:36.120
So why do you think the gamers have gravitated towards discord instead of Slack?

24:36.120 --> 24:37.120
It's easier to invite people.

24:37.120 --> 24:40.720
Slack, you have to have one admin who like has to approve everyone because like in a

24:40.720 --> 24:43.160
business environment, you don't just want anyone joining.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.160
You know what?

24:44.160 --> 24:49.000
That is a damn good point because I can, I don't think there's a problem with me saying

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
this.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.860
Uh, if, if there was, I'll hear it from Bobby later.

24:51.860 --> 24:57.740
But VOG network looked into getting a Slack, um, before discord was really big.

24:57.740 --> 25:00.780
And there were some people that were saying, Oh, you should definitely get VOG on Slack.

25:00.780 --> 25:02.100
You could do your chat and all this stuff.

25:02.100 --> 25:06.180
And we were kind of looking into it, but the thing that stopped us was what you just said.

25:06.180 --> 25:07.180
Yeah.

25:07.180 --> 25:12.800
The nice thing about the way the chat is at OLR right now is that you go onto the site,

25:12.800 --> 25:13.940
you just click and you're in.

25:13.940 --> 25:17.820
But with Slack, somebody would have to invite you and you wouldn't like, you know, that

25:17.820 --> 25:20.760
doesn't lend itself well to the instant gratification and that whole thing.

25:20.760 --> 25:25.960
The other part is that discord is almost entirely free and Slack is very much aimed

25:25.960 --> 25:29.480
at getting you to upgrade to an enterprise solution.

25:29.480 --> 25:35.440
So like my Guild Wars Guild uses Slack because of reasons and we are constantly running into,

25:35.440 --> 25:39.640
Oh, you can only show like, I think it's 10,000 messages on the free account.

25:39.640 --> 25:40.640
Yeah.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.280
And that goes by in like, I don't know.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.720
It's depending on how busy we are.

25:44.720 --> 25:47.160
It's the storage and image thing in Ingress.

25:47.160 --> 25:49.600
Go delete all your images.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.760
Because everybody's posting like, Oh, here's a field.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.760
Here's my badge.

25:53.760 --> 25:54.760
I got it.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.700
Everybody's posting all their stuff from their cell phone.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.880
It fills up the image thing so fucking fast.

25:58.880 --> 25:59.880
Right.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.080
So like that's the other reason because discord doesn't do that.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.340
You can search for it eventually.

26:03.340 --> 26:08.000
I think I don't know enough about discord to say, but like they don't like push you

26:08.000 --> 26:13.080
at, Oh, you're running out of image space, running out of message space, you should upgrade

26:13.080 --> 26:15.420
and each the upgrade is like priced per user.

26:15.420 --> 26:19.480
So like any sizable gaming community is not going to do that.

26:19.480 --> 26:23.360
Tiger con chat says how long until someone goes into a movie theater, turn on the voice

26:23.360 --> 26:26.280
chat and then you hear the movie coming through the voice chat.

26:26.280 --> 26:30.040
We wouldn't be able to see the movie that way, but I'm sure, I'm sure there are people

26:30.040 --> 26:31.560
that have a Periscope.

26:31.560 --> 26:32.560
That was the thing.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.800
I don't, I don't, I don't hear much about Periscope anymore.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.720
Twitter bought it and then kind of let it die.

26:37.720 --> 26:38.720
Just like they didn't rise.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.880
Um, you know, just like they did vine.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.800
Uh, don't let Twitter buy your company vine coming back.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.640
I thought vine was coming back.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.660
I think the founder said, gosh, this is terrible.

26:48.660 --> 26:53.780
They killed my products and is trying to bring it back, but anyway, but my point with

26:53.780 --> 26:55.860
that is that they were doing that with Periscope, right?

26:55.860 --> 26:58.540
People were shooting at the movie, uh, the movie.

26:58.540 --> 27:00.980
And that's, that's why sometimes the esters will come in and look at the eye because I

27:00.980 --> 27:02.220
want to make sure you're not filming the movie.

27:02.220 --> 27:06.540
Uh, but then the other big thing was a game of Thrones episodes were going on Periscope,

27:06.540 --> 27:11.380
uh, and like the, the big pay-per-view stuff, the Wrestle manias and the MMA is and all

27:11.380 --> 27:13.380
that stuff that was, that's huge.

27:13.380 --> 27:14.900
Probably still is a problem on Periscope.

27:14.900 --> 27:18.420
Honestly, I just, who's, who's uses I, I, you know what?

27:18.420 --> 27:21.700
Old Periscope fucking Instagram stories.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.140
I thought that was snap.

27:23.140 --> 27:26.540
They were killing snapshot with the both.

27:26.540 --> 27:31.460
You know, game of Thrones, like speaking of their piracy, like threatened, Oh, we'll pay

27:31.460 --> 27:35.660
somebody and we'll just release all of the spoilers like ahead of the season.

27:35.660 --> 27:36.660
Huh?

27:36.660 --> 27:38.340
That was a thing a couple of weeks ago.

27:38.340 --> 27:39.340
I remember that.

27:39.340 --> 27:40.340
I remember that.

27:40.340 --> 27:41.340
Uh, let's see.

27:41.340 --> 27:44.660
Also a tiger class says there's a going around YouTube that I discovered this weekend where

27:44.660 --> 27:48.300
they post audio of an audience reacting to infinity war.

27:48.300 --> 27:52.300
They don't show video, but rather audio of the audience reacting to certain scenes from

27:52.300 --> 27:53.300
the movie.

27:53.300 --> 27:55.240
So they aren't playing the entire movie.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.580
I've kind of seen that before.

27:56.580 --> 27:57.940
They've done that in marketing.

27:57.940 --> 28:00.500
Remember the very first paranormal activity?

28:00.500 --> 28:02.720
Like I remember the early trailer for that movie.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.640
It wasn't even really showing the movie.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.420
It was showing the audience's reaction to things in the movie.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.780
The movie was lame.

28:08.780 --> 28:09.780
Yeah.

28:09.780 --> 28:13.140
So, but that was how they sold and pro I want to say Blair witch project, I think did some

28:13.140 --> 28:14.140
of that too.

28:14.140 --> 28:16.880
Like those, those low budget movies that are super fucking scary.

28:16.880 --> 28:19.840
That's kind of how they sell them sometimes is showing the reaction to the movies.

28:19.840 --> 28:22.480
Didn't Blair witch project come out before YouTube was founded?

28:22.480 --> 28:23.840
Like how did they do reactions?

28:23.840 --> 28:25.760
You know, it was in the trailer.

28:25.760 --> 28:26.760
Oh, in the trailer.

28:26.760 --> 28:27.760
Remember?

28:27.760 --> 28:28.760
Oh, got it.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.760
Yeah.

28:29.760 --> 28:35.100
JD, I know you're a young kid, but back in my day, if you wanted to see a new trailer,

28:35.100 --> 28:36.800
you had to go see another movie.

28:36.800 --> 28:41.880
I thought you meant they posted a trail, like a separate, like, I think when Blair witch

28:41.880 --> 28:44.800
project came out, you had to download a quick time.

28:44.800 --> 28:49.920
There was no YouTube, but you could like go to MTV.com and get a quick time or something.

28:49.920 --> 28:50.920
Real media.

28:50.920 --> 28:51.920
Yes.

28:51.920 --> 28:52.920
Real player.

28:52.920 --> 28:53.920
Yeah.

28:53.920 --> 28:57.120
Or you just had to go on to like watch TV shows and they'd have a trailer from playing

28:57.120 --> 29:02.080
an exclusive trailer from Blair witch project after entertainment tonight.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.400
They still kind of do that though.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.400
Yeah, they do.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.400
Yeah.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.400
SSJ 100.

29:06.400 --> 29:10.400
Matt says used to be the Haven for pay-per-view and didn't that become Twitch?

29:10.400 --> 29:11.400
Oh yeah.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.400
Justin TV became Twitch.

29:12.760 --> 29:18.120
I always thought there's always rumors that Justin's going to come back, but I kind of,

29:18.120 --> 29:20.240
I don't think Justin TV is going to come back.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.640
I think it's just going to be Twitch is going to get bigger.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.080
That's that's what's going to happen.

29:24.080 --> 29:28.000
I feel like Justin got his stock options and got very rich and is on an island somewhere.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.320
Didn't Justin get let go or am I confusing him with somebody else?

29:31.320 --> 29:32.320
I haven't kept up.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.320
I know.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.320
All right.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.880
I won't go into that drama because I'll put my foot in my space.

29:36.880 --> 29:40.200
Tom is taking, he's a photographer now.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.200
My space.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.200
Dude, my space.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.600
Tom has to have so much fucking money.

29:44.600 --> 29:48.480
Didn't he sell that site when it was still a big deal or did he, did he, was he, was

29:48.480 --> 29:49.840
he gone by the time it was in the ground?

29:49.840 --> 29:50.840
I have no idea.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.640
Did he sell it to Justin Timberlake or something?

29:52.640 --> 29:54.120
I have no idea.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.120
God.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.320
Anyway, uh, let's see.

29:56.320 --> 30:02.200
Uh, also in chat at live.vognetwork.com, uh, let's see a dark tissue says, reminds me of

30:02.200 --> 30:06.640
the one guy, I think he streamed a UFC thing, but framed it as if he was playing one of

30:06.640 --> 30:07.640
the games.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.640
Oh yeah.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.640
That was a news story a while ago.

30:10.080 --> 30:14.320
I was said he was playing UFC, whatever on PlayStation four, but he was actually streaming

30:14.320 --> 30:16.800
the live event and clever.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.440
It's clever, highly illegal, but clever.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.440
My space.

30:20.440 --> 30:24.040
Tom's sold my space in 2005 for $580 million.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.680
Oh my God.

30:26.680 --> 30:31.040
Like, of course he's on a fucking desert island.

30:31.040 --> 30:36.040
Just like what, Oh my God, can you imagine $580 million?

30:36.040 --> 30:37.240
That's winning the power ball basically.

30:37.240 --> 30:38.240
Yeah.

30:38.840 --> 30:39.840
Mostly.

30:39.840 --> 30:40.840
Mostly.

30:43.840 --> 30:44.840
I shouldn't laugh at that.

30:44.840 --> 30:45.840
It's horrible.

30:45.840 --> 30:46.840
Brad fits.

30:46.840 --> 30:47.840
Isn't rolling in it.

30:47.840 --> 30:48.840
The, the founder of life.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.040
Oh, the founder of live journal.

30:50.040 --> 30:56.200
Well, you know, I mean he works at Google now, so he is, but, uh, let's see a rama and

30:56.200 --> 31:00.800
chat over at live.vognetwork.com says after being in the social network, Justin Timberlake

31:00.800 --> 31:03.480
bought my space from Fox interactive.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.280
Oh, that's right.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.280
Cause they sold my space.

31:06.280 --> 31:07.280
Yeah.

31:07.320 --> 31:08.320
Okay.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.320
So I mean it was the whole music thing.

31:09.320 --> 31:10.320
Yeah.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.320
And then they tried to turn my space in the music thing, but I don't think it really worked.

31:12.320 --> 31:15.480
I think it's still there, but it's kind of not, it is not what it was.

31:15.480 --> 31:16.480
Yeah.

31:16.480 --> 31:17.880
It's, it's the source of blackmail photos for everyone.

31:17.880 --> 31:18.960
Oh, right.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.080
Get in there and delete your my spaces.

31:21.080 --> 31:24.480
If you ever had a my space account, I, you better get in there and delete it or those

31:24.480 --> 31:26.840
old pictures are going to come back to haunt your ass.

31:26.840 --> 31:30.720
Thankfully I never posted anything questionable.

31:30.720 --> 31:35.360
Well even like, did you ever post silly things?

31:35.360 --> 31:36.360
Nope.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.920
Well then that's good for you.

31:37.920 --> 31:41.800
I deactivated mine a long time ago, but actually there's a part of me that's kind of sad.

31:41.800 --> 31:45.800
Like I wish I would have downloaded a backup first because you know, that's open.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.400
Like that was like when everybody was going digital for the first time.

31:48.400 --> 31:52.360
So I was like, I've lost this whole series of pictures from a time in my life because

31:52.360 --> 31:54.420
I, I nuked my space.

31:54.420 --> 31:59.240
So that's why I'm glad not everything is on Facebook, that it's like backed up on my phone

31:59.240 --> 32:02.440
and I do back up my phone to my computer once in a while and pull all the pictures down.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.800
So that's the nice thing.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.800
I don't want to have it all online.

32:05.800 --> 32:06.800
All right.

32:06.800 --> 32:11.320
Anyway, we have digressed enough from the topic of my space and discord of Microsoft

32:11.320 --> 32:12.320
and discord.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.320
Does my space have a discord?

32:13.320 --> 32:15.600
You think maybe here's the top eight channels.

32:15.600 --> 32:19.200
All right, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

32:19.200 --> 32:20.720
been playing this week.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.840
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

32:22.840 --> 32:24.440
It was non-existent.

32:24.440 --> 32:29.680
I haven't touched animal crossing in about a week and a half now.

32:29.680 --> 32:33.480
I also have only played a little bit of Pokemon.

32:33.480 --> 32:38.360
I have only played a little bit of Miitomo because I want to just see it through to

32:38.360 --> 32:40.960
its bitter end.

32:40.960 --> 32:48.960
And really it's mostly been watching Dan play, uh, you know, go Korok hunting in a Breath

32:48.960 --> 32:50.320
of the Wild.

32:50.320 --> 32:53.640
And then, yeah, not, not a whole bunch.

32:53.640 --> 32:56.620
Just I've got drag con that I'm getting ready for.

32:56.620 --> 33:01.320
So that's really been the, uh, the extent of it.

33:02.040 --> 33:03.040
Sorry.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.040
All good.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.040
It happens.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.360
Uh, Loki, I'm sure you've had a busy gaming week with the new console.

33:08.360 --> 33:09.360
Yeah, I did.

33:09.360 --> 33:13.200
I, so now of course, since I got the switch, I've been playing tons of Mario Odyssey.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.240
Um, so I haven't gotten that far in the game yet.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.760
My son already beat the game, but he's not collecting everything.

33:18.760 --> 33:23.440
So I'm up to the Lake Kingdom.

33:23.440 --> 33:31.100
I did the tree kingdom and so now just started that and I've got like 72 of the moons already

33:31.880 --> 33:36.700
and yeah, I have got Mario Kart 8 as well, but I haven't actually put that into the system

33:36.700 --> 33:40.740
yet and I'm looking at probably getting more games for it.

33:40.740 --> 33:42.060
I just haven't decided what yet.

33:42.060 --> 33:47.780
Minecraft probably, um, and then maybe some more multiplayer stuff.

33:47.780 --> 33:54.700
I kept looking at Labo and I kept going over and like, cause I saw it everywhere, you know,

33:54.700 --> 34:00.000
this weekend I was like, eh, I picked it up, but all I can think of after looking at my

34:00.000 --> 34:04.840
house and how destroyed it is with the kids crap everywhere, that stuff would just be

34:04.840 --> 34:07.600
all over the goddamn house and destroyed.

34:07.600 --> 34:12.160
So I just, I can't, I cannot buy Labo.

34:12.160 --> 34:18.960
It looks neat, but that they're going to get bored with that so quick that it's not worth

34:18.960 --> 34:19.960
it.

34:19.960 --> 34:20.960
It's just not worth it at all.

34:20.960 --> 34:25.600
So I mean as much fun as it would be to make a piano, I think I'd just be bored with it

34:25.600 --> 34:26.600
immediately.

34:26.600 --> 34:34.200
So not for me, um, but then aside from the Switch stuff, I did play a ton of Pokemon

34:34.200 --> 34:37.720
Go just because I've been in a lot of places that had Poke stops and stuff.

34:37.720 --> 34:45.200
Um, I think, I think it was kind of ironic that, um, one of the first last like research

34:45.200 --> 34:49.800
I had to do was catch three insect type Pokemon and all of a sudden there's no insect type

34:49.800 --> 34:50.800
Pokemon anywhere.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.040
It's like, it's like Paris a lot.

34:53.040 --> 34:57.240
Paris is, I don't know about your neck of the woods, but Paris is herpes around here.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.160
It is everywhere and unstoppable.

34:59.160 --> 35:03.840
But then when they do a special event, Paris is nowhere to be found.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.480
Yeah, it's, it's just, it's, and Venonat is the other one.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.680
Venonat is, is everywhere.

35:08.680 --> 35:12.000
And then when special event rolls in, it's like all the special stuff takes the Venonat

35:12.000 --> 35:13.820
and uh, Paris spawns.

35:13.820 --> 35:17.120
It was nice to be able to get some Wailmers cause I hadn't gotten any of those.

35:17.120 --> 35:20.080
So I got some of those and I've been catching Magikarp and stuff.

35:20.120 --> 35:25.000
I just been just catching as much as I can and just trying to do the daily things.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.840
But I've not been like killing myself if I don't get like certain things or whatever.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.840
Um, I don't know.

35:30.840 --> 35:31.840
It's just a good time killer.

35:31.840 --> 35:35.120
Like my kids are at the park today and so I did that cause the park that we're at had

35:35.120 --> 35:36.560
like three or four Pokestops.

35:36.560 --> 35:42.440
So I just kept walking between them to like, uh, stash up, you know, on the, you know,

35:42.440 --> 35:43.440
more items.

35:43.440 --> 35:46.880
Did you get to a high enough level in Ingress where you can send more, um, Pokestops?

35:46.880 --> 35:48.520
I think it's 10.

35:48.960 --> 35:50.640
Yeah, I'm like 13.

35:50.640 --> 35:51.640
Oh shoot.

35:51.640 --> 35:52.640
Yeah.

35:52.640 --> 35:53.640
Then you can also review.

35:53.640 --> 35:54.640
I mean, I don't, I'm sure.

35:54.640 --> 35:55.640
I did review some.

35:55.640 --> 35:56.640
Yeah.

35:56.640 --> 35:57.640
Just for fun.

35:57.640 --> 35:58.640
I just got bored.

35:58.640 --> 35:59.640
Yeah.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.640
I hear you.

36:00.640 --> 36:01.640
But um, yeah, you can submit too.

36:01.640 --> 36:02.640
Why not?

36:02.640 --> 36:03.640
Yeah, I guess I could.

36:03.640 --> 36:04.640
Um, so I may do that.

36:04.640 --> 36:05.640
Who knows?

36:05.640 --> 36:09.520
Um, then I was, other than that, I mean, that's pretty much it.

36:09.520 --> 36:13.840
It was just mainly just phone games and the switch and now that I have the switch and

36:13.840 --> 36:17.840
I'm this close to get in the Skyrim again.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.560
I don't want to, I don't want to buy Skyrim again.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.560
I'm this close though.

36:22.560 --> 36:23.560
It's tempted.

36:23.560 --> 36:26.440
They're very tempting, but I may just stick with my PC.

36:26.440 --> 36:29.160
I may end up getting on VR though cause that might be fun.

36:29.160 --> 36:35.280
Um, I think better than the switch, but yeah, I mean, I've kind of like looked at the stuff

36:35.280 --> 36:36.280
online.

36:36.280 --> 36:39.160
Um, some of the games are looking at like golf story might be really good.

36:39.160 --> 36:42.160
I hear that's a pretty fun RPG, so I may try that.

36:42.160 --> 36:45.280
Um, blaster masters looks pretty awesome.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.880
Oh, definitely get blast master.

36:47.880 --> 36:48.880
That's a good deal.

36:48.880 --> 36:49.880
So I may do that.

36:49.880 --> 36:54.080
Um, but like, it's kind of like, I've been hard trying to figure out what I want to purchase

36:54.080 --> 36:58.720
on the switch and like even like the Nintendo stuff, it's like, eh, I don't really want

36:58.720 --> 36:59.720
that.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.960
I mean, I'm, I guess I'll have to wait until E3 this year to see what else they're going

37:01.960 --> 37:02.960
to come out with.

37:02.960 --> 37:07.000
I hope they bring back Mario maker cause that's one I am really sad that I had to let go of

37:07.000 --> 37:12.560
because of this, but in the end of the thing I told my son too, cause I backed the ball

37:12.560 --> 37:14.360
with the saves before that.

37:14.360 --> 37:19.560
My PC runs a fucking Wii U emulator like a bomb, so I don't, it's not a big deal that

37:19.560 --> 37:24.800
we're losing some of those Wii U games, so I'll just play it on there.

37:24.800 --> 37:28.120
I think Mario maker would be a good one to come back to, but they did put it on 3DS that

37:28.120 --> 37:29.480
might've been there.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.480
I know, I know.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.480
It's not the same thing.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.480
It's not the same thing.

37:32.480 --> 37:33.480
It's not.

37:33.480 --> 37:35.880
And they like took out something really add anything so I can see them bringing it back

37:35.880 --> 37:40.640
as like a remaster of a game and maybe putting another Mario set in there.

37:40.640 --> 37:44.020
Maybe they do Mario two level Mario two game boy.

37:44.020 --> 37:48.240
Mario two played so different from the other Mario's because it wasn't originally a Mario

37:48.240 --> 37:49.240
game.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.040
So maybe Mario land.

37:51.040 --> 37:57.720
Well I would say another graphic skin they could do easy would be Mario all stars.

37:57.720 --> 37:58.720
That was missing.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.040
I think Mario all stars would be like an extra bonus skin they could put in there and that

38:02.040 --> 38:03.040
would work really well.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.920
Did they add any Odyssey stuff in yet?

38:05.920 --> 38:08.520
But Odyssey is 3D so it doesn't really work.

38:09.400 --> 38:14.880
Well I don't think they would do it, but we need for a 3D Mario maker do Odyssey Galaxy

38:14.880 --> 38:15.880
64.

38:15.880 --> 38:16.880
Sunshine.

38:16.880 --> 38:21.120
I would be that might be a bit much but yeah I mean I'd be for it if they if Nintendo can

38:21.120 --> 38:22.120
pull it off in a Nintendo way.

38:22.120 --> 38:24.640
I mean someone's pulled it off on an emulator for the 64.

38:24.640 --> 38:30.640
I think a Mario maker with the bonus all stars skin would be a smart thing to do.

38:30.640 --> 38:34.520
Mario two like again I'm all for it like in theory it would be awesome and if Nintendo

38:34.520 --> 38:37.200
can kind of figure out how to incorporate that Mario maker but I almost feel like that

38:37.200 --> 38:41.600
would have to be a separate thing because Mario two is not the same game as the others.

38:41.600 --> 38:42.600
Or just bring some.

38:42.600 --> 38:48.600
Although it would be sorry it would be badass if you could like I do think about NES remix

38:48.600 --> 38:52.860
like you know those games and it had these random ass stages where you could play as

38:52.860 --> 38:56.560
the princess in Super Mario Brothers 3.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.080
Like that was some of the weird shit it did.

38:58.080 --> 39:02.160
So actually it would be really rad and I think would justify a re-release of Mario maker

39:02.160 --> 39:07.920
if they did a Super Mario maker with Mario two Mario all stars and you can play as Luigi

39:07.920 --> 39:10.760
Toad and Princess.

39:10.760 --> 39:11.760
That would be right.

39:11.760 --> 39:12.760
Wouldn't that be awesome.

39:12.760 --> 39:16.240
But and then people would really have to think about some of the levels and the fact that

39:16.240 --> 39:19.940
you know Toad and Princess and Luigi and some of the things they could do would be different.

39:19.940 --> 39:20.940
So I don't know.

39:20.940 --> 39:22.240
There's a lot to do with it.

39:22.240 --> 39:23.680
Yeah there's a lot you could do with it.

39:23.680 --> 39:27.080
So OK J.D. how was your gaming week.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.080
It was good.

39:28.080 --> 39:29.080
Yeah.

39:29.080 --> 39:31.160
I've been also playing Odyssey.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.000
I've beaten the game already.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.760
So but they put in a lot of updates recently.

39:36.760 --> 39:40.080
Like they introduced I mean this is in the past couple of months but I haven't really

39:40.080 --> 39:42.080
picked it up until now.

39:42.080 --> 39:52.000
They put in a Luigi balloon mode where it's hide and seek with balloons and that's been

39:52.000 --> 39:54.160
a lot of fun.

39:54.160 --> 40:00.900
And it's a huge coin maker like I will never need to grind for coins again with this mode.

40:00.900 --> 40:04.540
So they put in a bunch of new costumes to buy.

40:04.540 --> 40:11.540
So I've been playing dress up and I finally went through the stupid volleyball moon where

40:11.540 --> 40:14.940
you have to like hit it a hundred times.

40:14.940 --> 40:20.940
I've also been playing Splatoon within the single player mode mostly Splatoon 2.

40:20.940 --> 40:21.940
Splatoon 2.

40:21.940 --> 40:22.940
Yeah.

40:22.940 --> 40:23.940
Sorry I don't have the first one.

40:23.940 --> 40:24.940
Yeah.

40:24.940 --> 40:28.540
The single player mode has like a bunch of collectibles so that's what I've been doing.

40:28.540 --> 40:34.140
And they recently like in the past week put Callie in if you've beaten the game.

40:34.140 --> 40:37.160
So I wanted to see what that was about.

40:37.160 --> 40:41.900
I've also been buying a bunch of 3DS games when they go on sale on my Nintendo.

40:41.900 --> 40:47.320
It's like 30% off and you know it's a digital copy so I'm on board with that.

40:47.320 --> 40:53.660
So I've recently gone most of the way through Paper Mario Sticker Star which I have feelings

40:53.660 --> 40:56.660
about.

40:56.660 --> 40:57.660
And then.

40:57.660 --> 41:00.260
Just wait a minute elaborate on this please.

41:00.260 --> 41:06.260
I mean the Paper Mario series is pretty inconsistent like it's the first two games were fantastic

41:06.260 --> 41:10.740
and then the Wii one was a bit of a departure and I feel like it's kind of deteriorated

41:10.740 --> 41:11.740
from there.

41:11.740 --> 41:12.740
I love the Wii one.

41:12.740 --> 41:15.480
I mean that's the only one I played so I don't know.

41:15.480 --> 41:19.640
It's different like the first two are much more like standard RPGs and the Wii one was

41:19.640 --> 41:22.820
like a hybrid platformer RPG.

41:22.820 --> 41:29.640
And then Sticker Star like is just a like it's kind of a weird like run around adventure

41:29.640 --> 41:30.780
kind of a thing.

41:30.780 --> 41:36.160
And the thing that really bothers me the most is that you in order to attack you have to

41:36.160 --> 41:42.460
use stickers which are consumable and I'm the kind of gamer who hoards everything because

41:42.460 --> 41:44.700
I might need it someday.

41:44.700 --> 41:49.780
And I have all these I have hundreds of potions in Skyrim and I may need them at some point.

41:49.780 --> 41:50.780
Right.

41:50.780 --> 41:55.620
The inventory management was really difficult because you can only hold so many and then

41:55.620 --> 42:01.360
it's like well OK I might need this because I only have so many jumps but there's this

42:01.360 --> 42:04.980
really big one that's powerful that I want to hang on to because I just found it and

42:04.980 --> 42:07.700
if I don't make room for it I'll lose it.

42:07.700 --> 42:11.060
But then I have to get rid of the attacks that I'm using because you can't do anything

42:11.060 --> 42:16.860
without a sticker like that whole mechanic really did not work for me.

42:16.860 --> 42:21.220
And then I've been playing Animal Crossing Pocket Camp and Pokemon Go.

42:21.220 --> 42:27.740
Animal Crossing they put in loot boxes that are cutesy fortune cookies and like literally

42:27.740 --> 42:32.620
everybody I've read anything about like on Reddit or whatever is upset about it because

42:32.620 --> 42:39.060
they cost a pretty significant amount of real world money to get for the most part and you're

42:39.060 --> 42:40.940
not guaranteed uniques.

42:40.940 --> 42:46.740
So like I think the stats someone posted said if you were to buy enough fortune cookies

42:46.740 --> 42:51.740
to get one of each item if you had perfect luck it would be like $20.

42:51.740 --> 42:55.380
Wait the only person I always defer to Jamie when it comes to Animal Crossing is this kind

42:55.380 --> 42:56.380
of why I stopped playing.

42:56.380 --> 42:57.380
Oh yeah.

42:57.380 --> 42:59.340
Oh so this you are not you're not a fan of this either.

42:59.340 --> 43:00.340
No.

43:00.340 --> 43:02.620
So it has taken the fun out of it for me.

43:02.620 --> 43:03.620
Yikes.

43:03.620 --> 43:04.620
Yikes Nintendo.

43:04.620 --> 43:08.940
A lot of Animal Crossing players like to complete the catalog because that's you know all the

43:08.940 --> 43:14.220
items you know it's fashion it's whatever and fortune cookie items the paid ones or

43:14.220 --> 43:19.440
I mean you can do it with in game currency sort of a little bit but not like all of it.

43:19.440 --> 43:21.420
Those also go in the same catalog.

43:21.420 --> 43:26.760
So it's like well you have to either be OK with an incomplete list of everything or pay

43:26.760 --> 43:31.660
real world money and it's gambling because you don't know are you going to get the rare

43:31.660 --> 43:36.340
or are you going to get the stupid two star item that you've got four times already.

43:36.340 --> 43:40.420
Yeah there's there's a lot of content that they put in that's been locked behind.

43:40.420 --> 43:42.980
Not only is it paid but it's limited time.

43:42.980 --> 43:47.660
Like they put in a fortune cookie that's like here's a bunch of game consoles that

43:47.660 --> 43:50.380
you can get for your house or for your campsite.

43:50.380 --> 43:53.140
But this is only here for two weeks.

43:53.140 --> 43:55.900
Like it's it's yeah it's frustrating.

43:55.900 --> 43:56.900
OK.

43:56.900 --> 43:58.980
All right.

43:58.980 --> 44:03.300
Well we're going to move on to me and my gaming week.

44:03.300 --> 44:07.100
My gaming week was kind of a potpourri of a lot of different type of stuff.

44:07.100 --> 44:11.420
I've randomly got back into Diablo 3 it's like Diablo is one of those it's one of those

44:11.420 --> 44:12.420
old flings.

44:12.420 --> 44:17.140
You just kind of end up going back to once in a while and they ever going to bring that

44:17.140 --> 44:21.380
to the switch because you know those are those rumors I know we talked we talked about previously

44:21.380 --> 44:25.780
I'll be a very interesting sort of like the most land Diablo experience would be if they

44:25.780 --> 44:28.900
brought it to switch and everybody could play Diablo on their own screens or gauntlet.

44:28.900 --> 44:34.260
I'll play gauntlet on multiplayer like gauntlet would be a lot more possible because they

44:34.260 --> 44:38.060
did have that gauntlet remake a couple of years ago that was on PlayStation 4 and Steam

44:38.060 --> 44:39.060
and all that.

44:39.060 --> 44:41.940
So there's no reason they couldn't put that on switch if they wanted to.

44:41.980 --> 44:46.180
I don't know if they're still you know supporting gauntlet but anyway.

44:46.180 --> 44:53.620
So I was playing I was playing that and kind of got sucked back into the season play season

44:53.620 --> 44:57.300
13 right now so I've been working on that I'm almost to level 70 I have a little more

44:57.300 --> 44:58.300
ways to go.

44:58.300 --> 45:00.500
So I've been doing that on PC.

45:00.500 --> 45:04.020
Also been playing Overwatch continuing to do that especially since they still have that

45:04.020 --> 45:05.260
special event going on.

45:05.260 --> 45:09.940
I still have yet to get a skin for that oh wait no I take it back I got a Reinhardt skin

45:09.940 --> 45:14.340
great a character I never pick in a quick play I got a skin for them oh well.

45:14.340 --> 45:20.620
All I wanted was the Kris Jenner Sombra skin that's all I wanted and instead you got Alexis

45:20.620 --> 45:23.020
Michelle basically.

45:23.020 --> 45:29.300
So anyway I've been playing a little bit of Overwatch and I've actually not been playing

45:29.300 --> 45:33.020
as much Final Fantasy 14 lately I'm kind of waiting for the next content patch and that

45:33.020 --> 45:36.900
I'll log in to keep my house and my account active but that's about it.

45:36.900 --> 45:40.460
And then randomly I was on Xbox One playing some stuff on there so I talked about Gianna

45:40.460 --> 45:43.820
Sisters earlier and since you were visiting this weekend I was like let's look at some

45:43.820 --> 45:48.540
of the backwards compatible stuff you had never seen Beaten Groovy before and I was

45:48.540 --> 45:53.540
like let me show you how Konami shot themselves in the foot when they tried to launch Papa

45:53.540 --> 45:58.020
Music here in the US and so we played Beaten Groovy which I still to this day I don't know

45:58.020 --> 46:03.460
why anybody wasted a second of time trying to make that game backwards compatible I mean

46:03.460 --> 46:08.260
I guess making something else backwards compatible made that backwards compatible so I was like

46:08.260 --> 46:13.580
hey bonus but that game is a waste of everything so but I had to show you what an abomination

46:13.580 --> 46:16.860
was so we got to see that that was fun right you know they have a popin music game on the

46:16.860 --> 46:22.500
Wii too I know I never played it yeah I didn't either is it yeah I was like is it interesting

46:22.500 --> 46:28.580
I tell you what my Wii is homebrew enabled so I might at some point when I'm bored just

46:28.580 --> 46:35.900
like download it and try it there you go and then um let's see uh also I've still been

46:35.900 --> 46:41.620
playing Minecraft what the heck I'm still playing Minecraft I um I was playing a little

46:41.620 --> 46:47.420
bit more on that so after last you need to tell me when after last week's show we went

46:47.420 --> 46:52.540
on to twitch and I did a world called Miss Vanjie that but it was like spelled in all

46:52.540 --> 46:56.040
caps this time so I got a different world and we're actually doing a little bit of multiplayer

46:56.040 --> 47:00.640
and I still kind of went on in that world but I got really frustrated that I could not for the

47:00.640 --> 47:06.280
life of me find any iron like just freaking iron I was like not finding so finally I decided to

47:06.280 --> 47:12.480
give up on Miss Vanjie and on the I think it was Thursday night I rolled a new world because I

47:12.480 --> 47:16.520
wanted to see what it looked like if you let the chest and the village start in the game because I

47:16.520 --> 47:22.520
hadn't seen any of that so I started a new world called proportion izing it was my seed do you like

47:22.560 --> 47:27.000
that I like that one I did and some some of you out there will get the reference some work but

47:27.000 --> 47:33.280
some won't but I started a new world called proportion izing and it's actually probably my

47:33.280 --> 47:39.600
favorite seed I've done yet so there is that it's all in lowercase proportion izing and I was able

47:39.600 --> 47:43.080
to quickly build a little shelter in the side of the mountain and then there's a little village

47:43.080 --> 47:47.600
that's like right there and so I kind of got to see that village mechanic but damn they want a lot

47:47.600 --> 47:51.960
of shit to give you an emerald oh my god they weren't like the one guy wants like 25 pieces

47:51.960 --> 47:56.280
of paper for one emerald and I'm like where's sugar cane around here it's fine emeralds yeah

47:56.280 --> 48:02.640
where do you find it Oh emeralds are in the care in their abandoned mine shafts do you yell Eureka

48:02.640 --> 48:12.480
when you find something I do I do and and there are is plenty of iron that was the I started not

48:12.480 --> 48:17.840
far from this gigantic cave entrance and it was like one of those were like the underground was

48:17.880 --> 48:22.320
already like really opened up and there's all these places to go in the underground and so

48:22.320 --> 48:26.800
I was finding hella iron in there so I was able to make myself a full suit of armor pretty quick

48:26.800 --> 48:30.920
so yeah I was pretty happy with that anyway minecraft minecraft minecraft but like I'm

48:30.920 --> 48:36.480
actually into minecraft but I'm gonna kind of dial it back a bit because I'm waiting for mr.

48:36.480 --> 48:43.880
black wolf to be available again so we can start our official vog realm so we can invite switch

48:43.880 --> 48:51.440
players Xbox players and PC players to all play together on the vog realm which we will see what

48:51.440 --> 48:58.080
drag race word of the will be available technically Android and iOS players oh yeah Android iOS

48:58.080 --> 49:03.960
players so yeah everybody will be able to play on that realm so I'll be fun as 200 Matt says I need

49:03.960 --> 49:07.840
to get back into minecraft yeah it's fun it's fun but I'm having a hard time kind of breaking like

49:07.840 --> 49:11.680
past that first phase of the game when you're collecting iron when you start have to like

49:11.680 --> 49:16.240
really start collecting the other stuff for like redstone like you know you need redstone to be able

49:16.240 --> 49:19.960
to make a compass and all that other stuff you know when you can kind of really start to go into

49:19.960 --> 49:25.440
the next phase of the game but yeah just dig on down I know you gotta keep keep digging down keep

49:25.440 --> 49:30.040
digging how do you know you've hit the bottom in minecraft do you hit is it all lava at the bottom

49:30.040 --> 49:36.000
it's bedrock you won't be able to go any further okay okay and you see like this like weird black

49:36.000 --> 49:42.040
fog type stuff oh interesting okay well I'll so I have yet to hit absolute rock bottom it's like

49:42.040 --> 49:49.760
I don't remember like the exact depth I know like I remember his many down as it is up it's like 64

49:49.760 --> 49:57.640
down and 64 oh it's more than that is there than 128 down 128 up maybe yeah it's got to be some

49:57.640 --> 50:03.440
power of two otherwise you're talking 256 down that's that's I think it might be 256 is it really

50:03.440 --> 50:07.960
I don't know I can look it up I'm sure it's on the way you've done that thing where you find the

50:07.960 --> 50:13.640
edge of the world and everything goes crazy I play on the worlds that keep like they go forever

50:13.640 --> 50:19.000
yeah that you can't find the edge ever I just remember that being a thing once yeah I know

50:19.000 --> 50:23.440
well especially because I guess they split so now you just have minecraft which are all the

50:23.440 --> 50:27.800
connected versions are just minecraft you have minecraft PlayStation 4 Edition because it's not

50:27.800 --> 50:33.720
connected to the others you have minecraft Java Edition which is the old-school minecraft where

50:33.720 --> 50:38.120
you still have to like craft everything by hand and stuff and that has probably what you're talking

50:38.120 --> 50:44.120
about yeah yeah so but I like I like Windows 10 minecraft a lot and I'm really excited for when

50:44.120 --> 50:49.320
they do the super duper graphics 4k thing that's gonna be I know 4k minecraft I'm so excited but

50:49.320 --> 50:52.560
the weather effects are what I'm really looking forward to I think they'll look really cool yeah

50:52.560 --> 50:58.520
all right anyway that's enough for my gaming week so I'm gonna quickly say that you can follow us on

50:58.520 --> 51:04.080
Twitter at twitter.com slash olr we're also on Facebook at orange lounge radio and that's really

51:04.080 --> 51:09.680
all I have to announce tonight not a lot of announcements we I'm considering taking the

51:09.680 --> 51:15.000
show off when she goes to drag con so that's gonna be in two weeks but I'll have a final call on that

51:15.000 --> 51:19.400
next week because it looks like I'm gonna be in San Francisco that weekend hanging with JD because

51:19.400 --> 51:23.960
that's Eurovision weekend apparently is the same weekend is so I may just end up staying in San

51:23.960 --> 51:31.000
Francisco so later the total height of the map is 256 okay so 128 up 128 but the highest they

51:31.000 --> 51:36.800
basically the way they say is the highest sea level or sea water levels give me 62 so you think

51:36.800 --> 51:44.280
it's not quite even it's not even so like you're probably looking at 180 something down got it okay

51:44.280 --> 51:50.360
I see so it's not it's not evil and they have four layers of bedrock too so okay got it why

51:50.360 --> 51:55.480
do they have four layers of bedrock if because it's a seed and so it's just kind of scattered

51:55.480 --> 52:03.080
around so you don't fall through it okay interesting okay all right well we're going to

52:03.080 --> 52:09.080
move on to some news and the news this week and of course again if you're listening live you can

52:09.080 --> 52:14.880
always join us at live.vognetwork.com I want to say I was looking at chat cuz there's a really

52:14.880 --> 52:18.400
funny comment I read earlier that I wanted to read oh here it is I I missed this comment earlier I

52:18.400 --> 52:24.380
want to read it now MXC in our chat room said my gaming week was non-existent because Rob named

52:24.380 --> 52:31.600
drop the soap opera passions last week so my time was spent binging that goddamn show you're welcome

52:31.600 --> 52:37.080
and tell me tell me you don't love Tabitha and Timmy but try not to be sad because Timmy actually

52:37.080 --> 52:42.680
like passed away halfway through the making of that show and I think they replaced Timmy with a

52:42.680 --> 52:47.840
female doll at some point I don't remember I need to go back and binge the show myself to remember

52:47.840 --> 52:58.920
so or to quote the wonderful show dinosaurs uh-huh we're gonna need new Timmy all right news let's

52:58.920 --> 53:04.920
get into some gaming news Loki all right so Nintendo is getting a new president so basically

53:05.760 --> 53:15.960
the previous president which was Tatsumi can we have Nintendo influence America I couldn't resist

53:15.960 --> 53:22.840
sorry please continue Tatsumi Kimishima it basically is gonna step down and replacing them

53:22.840 --> 53:32.640
is gonna be Shintaro Furukawa and I guess he joined the company in 1994 where he was he's

53:32.640 --> 53:39.120
been an outside director of the Pokemon company since 2012 and then a managing executive officer

53:39.120 --> 53:44.800
and then supervisor of corporate analysis and administration division and director of Nintendo

53:44.800 --> 53:54.200
since 2016 so doesn't really say anything's gonna really change from that but I guess well they're

53:54.200 --> 53:58.240
not gonna okay they're not gonna be like we changed our president and the whole get a hold

53:58.240 --> 54:02.400
on your butts because everything is gonna fucking change not everything's gonna change I know like

54:02.720 --> 54:08.880
when we had like our company had president changes or CEO changes you know that basically it's not

54:08.880 --> 54:13.080
necessarily the direction but like kind of their focus may have changed like they might be one in

54:13.080 --> 54:19.320
the focus more on like one aspect of the company or one direction versus another so you may have

54:19.320 --> 54:26.400
like a difference in like kind of where they want to use where they want the company to go and well

54:26.400 --> 54:31.080
what's also interesting is that this this new president what was his name again I'm it's gonna

54:31.080 --> 54:35.520
take some getting used to free kumashima oh kimishim is that no kimishim is the no it's a

54:35.520 --> 54:42.400
Furukawa Furukawa yeah Furukawa is the new president he's only like 45 years old right

54:42.400 --> 54:49.120
yeah it's 46 years old 46 years old okay so he's seven years older than me so he grew up on the

54:49.120 --> 54:53.680
Nintendo he grew up in a world where Nintendo was already I couldn't think of a more perfect person

54:53.680 --> 55:01.040
for that yeah right um and well I mean what I'm assuming is by going with somebody who is a little

55:01.040 --> 55:06.360
more younger you know not that I am for age discrimination but when a wada took over Nintendo

55:06.360 --> 55:11.120
he was a younger guy too if I remember right and he really became kind of the face of Nintendo I

55:11.120 --> 55:16.000
mean obviously you know Miyamoto just you know I would hope with like someone that is a bit younger

55:16.000 --> 55:19.800
like that would be a little bit more tech savvy and so we don't have any of these scenarios where

55:19.800 --> 55:26.200
it's like we don't know what Xbox Live is like and so you know like I think they have like this

55:26.200 --> 55:30.320
is years ago that we talked about this like where they didn't even it seemed like they didn't know

55:30.320 --> 55:35.440
what their competition was doing in the realm of like network at least he doesn't look as scary as

55:35.440 --> 55:40.560
Yamauchi did cuz I always thought that he looked like he was former Yakuza or something I know

55:40.560 --> 55:44.480
every time we would watch like Dan and I would watch a Nintendo documentary we would just say

55:44.480 --> 55:50.560
it's Yamauchi of the Yamauchi gumi hmm so well and I think a lot of people are wondering like did

55:50.560 --> 55:57.400
did Kimishima do something wrong or was were they unhappy with him he wants a younger guy well I

55:57.640 --> 56:01.960
think that was what he said right well it's part that but I think the other thing to remember is

56:01.960 --> 56:07.200
that I do recall when they put Kimishima and they were like this is this was always temporary yeah

56:07.200 --> 56:13.160
and basically you know it wasn't that he wasn't doing well it was just basically said that Kimishima

56:13.160 --> 56:18.240
thought that Nintendo's management needed to be younger to better understand its customers thank

56:18.240 --> 56:23.440
you thank you well in Kimishima I mean you know here's the thing I'm not gonna knock him at all

56:23.440 --> 56:29.720
because he he did exactly what he needed to do he carried out a wata's vision he was a financial

56:29.720 --> 56:34.240
guy and you can say that you can certainly say Nintendo is in a great fucking place financially

56:34.240 --> 56:39.600
now the switch has done very well you know and all this stuff so I know Kimishima has done what

56:39.600 --> 56:45.920
he went there to do so I think he's been the guy that kind of his role was to fully carry out what

56:45.920 --> 56:52.120
a wata was working on now you're gonna have this new guy come in that's gonna be okay what's the

56:52.120 --> 56:57.160
next Nintendo system what's the next direction for Nintendo and I think that's what this new

56:57.160 --> 57:01.840
guy is gonna be coming in to do in part not to say that Nintendo probably doesn't already have

57:01.840 --> 57:07.200
a plan in place for the next few years and maybe even has an idea of what their next system is but

57:07.200 --> 57:11.840
I think this is going to be the guy that then carries that next system out and I think it's

57:11.840 --> 57:16.480
probably gonna be more of a face of the company like Kimishima he never showed up in Nintendo

57:16.480 --> 57:22.520
Directs no he didn't do any of the the shows or anything they always sent Reggie to any of the

57:22.520 --> 57:27.120
American talk shows maybe Miyamoto with his that infamous thumbs up thumbs down thing from the

57:27.120 --> 57:31.360
Tonight Show and all that but for the most part you know those are the guys making all the public

57:31.360 --> 57:37.680
appearances so I'm imagining because this guy is younger he and maybe just his attitude I mean we

57:37.680 --> 57:42.480
haven't really seen this guy yet maybe he is going to be more of the guy you're gonna see and be like

57:42.480 --> 57:47.760
that face of Nintendo now and that I'm assuming that's kind of why they're doing this transition

57:47.760 --> 57:54.720
now so my assumption is that e3 is going to be this guy's big unveiling he you because the

57:54.720 --> 57:59.680
transition doesn't happen till the end of May right it doesn't actually become effective till

57:59.680 --> 58:06.080
then or mid-may or something that probably yeah so e3 is going to be the official unveiling of

58:06.080 --> 58:09.920
this new CEO and that's when you're gonna really get to meet him and know his personality I think

58:09.920 --> 58:14.440
a little bit in the Nintendo Direct at least that's my said summer so I don't know okay when

58:14.440 --> 58:21.040
that's one they're determining summer is gonna be okay all right fair enough fair enough so yeah so

58:21.040 --> 58:25.400
again I it's kind of one of those things where it's like oh shoot Nintendo got a new president

58:25.400 --> 58:30.040
like I wasn't expecting that but it's like oh wait a minute but you know Kimishima was supposed

58:30.040 --> 58:34.920
to be a temporary guy he wasn't you know he was only gonna be there to really finish off what a

58:34.920 --> 58:39.280
wata had started and and now we're starting to see really okay now what is the future

58:39.280 --> 58:47.040
Nintendo look like so very interested to see what this guy does no pressure right right maybe hope

58:47.040 --> 58:53.160
a virtual console on maybe you maybe he will if he you know what if he grew up on Famicom games

58:53.160 --> 58:58.920
then maybe he's gonna say I want to play those games again we need to figure out a way to make

58:58.920 --> 59:02.840
those games back out there I wouldn't be surprised if he had gaming watches when he was a kid you

59:02.840 --> 59:07.400
know for the market they were intended for course of course now is the right type of nostalgia to

59:07.400 --> 59:14.200
cash in on well and and is it going to be another classic NES I mean because there's no reason why

59:14.200 --> 59:19.280
Nintendo could not wouldn't do like a classic NES too and it could take you know what they could

59:19.280 --> 59:24.920
absolutely do a classic NES too and it's shaped like the new Nintendo's that hardly anybody had

59:24.920 --> 59:29.440
the top loaders you know what I mean so there's no reason they couldn't do another one of those

59:29.440 --> 59:34.720
I still wanted to get one of the Famicom style ones oh one of the classic Famicoms yeah except

59:34.720 --> 59:38.760
the thing that I always hated about the Famicom is that the controllers are attached and really

59:38.760 --> 59:45.680
short hmm all right well let's move on to other Microsoft news and Jason alluded to this in the

59:45.680 --> 59:52.240
intro and I find this very fascinating there's a new April Xbox update and it started coming out

59:52.240 --> 59:56.480
you're starting to see that on the Xbox one and there's a lot of new stuff with it including

59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.280
advanced video modes that will allow you to smooth out displays club and community tournament

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:06.840
improvements and this is pretty big deal you can share your controller with one of your viewers on

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:13.160
mixer so whereas the PlayStation has share play which is more of a private thing right you kind

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.880
of streamed one of your friends and they can take your controller mixer is gonna allow you to do

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:22.200
this with your viewers you know and mixer again if you didn't already know is Microsoft's kind of

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:27.880
competitor for twitch and it's interesting to see you know they're really trying to think of some

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:32.600
different ideas than which twitch is provided so this is this is very different and I think you

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:37.120
would crack the joke before the show before we went online you could give your controller over

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:41.240
to somebody on mixer and then that person could go in and delete all your save files I don't think

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.400
that's gonna be how it works I know well you and I imagine you can take the controller back in a

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:51.720
heartbeat if if somebody's fucking around or whatever with this will be low latency mode so

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:56.800
if the TV has a low latency or game mode your Xbox is gonna be able to communicate you're playing a

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:02.640
game to the device and switch the mode automatically so it's gonna tell your TV to switch future is now

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:11.840
that's right also adding support for 2560 by 1440 that's kind of neat to variable refresh rate start

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.920
the mixer broadcast anywhere on Xbox one and a pause animation if you switch games or go to the

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:22.080
dashboard you can share screenshots directly to Twitter now which I think PlayStation 4 is let

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:26.040
you've done that do that for a while but Xbox will have you do that light and dark themes for

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.040
everybody a high contrast theme probably for those that need a little help with the site things

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:37.240
improvements to Xbox narrator again great accessibility changes their balance in game

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:43.280
audio and streamed music spatial audio on the Xbox one dashboard an updated edge browser woohoo

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.720
anyone can create community tournaments new filters to club feeds club admins can filter

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:54.240
invitation requests and experimental new features oh I like a system that experiments but that's

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.840
everything to look forward to in the April update so what do you guys think controller sharing on

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:04.000
mixer is this a good thing or is this a waste of time on Microsoft to put this in I think it's a

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.760
waste of time I just don't know yet how that's gonna be utilized and I guess we'll have to see

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.840
when people are streaming how they utilize that hey play my game while I pee yeah play my game

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:18.280
while I pee pretty much I wonder if they're gonna try to do like twitch plays Pokemon style stuff

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:23.400
like because mixer is their streaming thing and like twitch plays Pokemon was probably one of the

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:28.200
first times I heard twitch being like a big name so maybe they're trying to go for something like

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:35.440
plays pub G can you imagine a thing though we're like mixer plays Pokemon well yeah it'll probably

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.600
be a Microsoft game but racer plays halo or something where each person can control for

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:47.080
one second yeah I mean like maybe that's the kind of like creative stuff they're trying to win you

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:52.600
know get on board with who knows guys you don't chat says PlayStation 4 been doing share play out

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:57.560
the box I don't think that was out the box the streaming was out of the box on the PlayStation

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.440
4 but I don't think share play came in till later yeah that wasn't until later where you

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.000
could share your controller with somebody else I didn't come in till later but but the difference

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.560
here is on PlayStation 4 it's private on mixer it's gonna be public right I think it's for

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.000
different intents so I don't know if it's gonna be the same right yeah just let me like hey you

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.240
want to try this game or want play co-op with me but you could and share please share please

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:27.000
though it's not so that's why I'm kind of confused on this so like is this where like I can start a

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.280
game say of halo death match or something like that and I could have three other people join

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:35.640
like to play local play type thing like they're like remotely controlling player two three and

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:40.360
four or is this gonna be like hey I'm playing halo you take over the controls for me and I'm

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.600
like hands off and I'm just gonna commentate on you playing this or something either or would be

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.260
if it's like share play it would be either or so but the other thing would be that they'd have to

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:55.080
kind of have the load that they'd have to have really good latency but I think mixer already

01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:01.360
has like super low latency because mixer is kind of the way twitch used to be before twitch got

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.560
really big remember how like it was almost instantaneous on twitch previously and now

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:10.920
there's like what a 25 second delay or something on twitch whereas on mixer I think it's much lower

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:15.360
so maybe you know cuz it isn't gonna be hard to play a platforming game or something if it's not

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:20.920
like instantaneous the nice thing about share play is it does feel really good like it's not like I

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.720
wouldn't play a music game or anything on it but playing like other like playing like monster

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:30.880
hunter or something like you it does feel normal like you're playing a normal game instantaneous

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.160
you're gonna have people stream sniping these guys but I mean well I don't think you're just gonna be

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.920
able to like you're gonna have to give permission for somebody to take controls well right what I'm

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:44.520
saying is though is if it's instantaneous in order for it to be able to handle something like this

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:49.680
people are gonna be able to watch people play PUBG yeah and they can stream snipe them because

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:54.480
there's no delay well you could do that now anyway no you can't because there's a delay in playing

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:58.520
the game there's like a 25 second delay you said no mixer doesn't have that delay and the mixers

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:04.200
never had that delay oh it's it's much shorter but it's gonna have to get even shorter you know

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:10.560
I mean right anyway I'm excited to see what this is and I like that mixer is doing these sorts of

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:15.520
things to really try to differentiate themselves from twitch like it does kind of make me go I

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:22.360
should be doing stuff more stuff with mixer but then I go but twitch will pay me so or at least I

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:28.000
there is a money-making mechanism through twitch right now so you know there is there is that to

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.760
consider and and I think if mixer could kind of figure that all out like I know you can become a

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:39.920
mixer partner and stuff but you know it's it's not they need that more entry-level type of program I

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:46.320
think to really have that take off it'll come in and if it doesn't then if this is popular then

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:51.600
twitch will just copy it but twitch hasn't been copying what make sure does I would have thought

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:57.520
for sure twitch would have jacked the multi stream thing by now but they haven't this is interesting

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:04.000
all right maybe it's because in a lot of streams on mixer it's very messy and that's because you

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.040
can do a multi stream of four people but the problem is all four people keep talking over

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:13.560
each other like these people need to use like a unified chat environment or something where it

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.840
would make the streams a lot cleaner if they did that's how they do it with awesome games done

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:23.160
quick it's basically just you have audio from one whoever's in the lead that's the audio you hear

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:29.680
yeah however they rotate it around yeah looking in chat at live dog network comms Kaijuto says

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:35.720
twitch probably can't do it because they don't have the tech they're related to Amazon now don't

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:40.640
forget they've got they've got plenty of tech let's see blueberry and chat says can Xbox now

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:47.400
play local co-op online or only with gold oh that's a good question about would gold people

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:53.120
only be able to use the mixer control we don't know that do we know if that's only available to

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.720
gold or not good question because share play on PlayStation 4 you have to have PlayStation

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:02.000
Plus to take the controller you don't have to have PlayStation Plus to watch but you have to

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.920
have PlayStation Plus to take the controller so that's a very good question and I'm not sure one

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:11.440
that has been answered yet so all right well let's move on with some other stories dark soccer what

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:17.880
do you have for us oh in other news there are well you know hackers gonna hack and data miners

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:25.800
gonna data mine so there are some new Super Mario Odyssey costumes coming out they the names were

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:31.120
data mined in February but now the designs are released so we have a zombie outfit that's got

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:38.000
Mario all green and happy and torn to bits with an axe in his head that's charming there's also I

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:47.640
guess a looks like a 17th century or 18th century French nobleman outfit complete with wig there's

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:53.040
an astronaut no maybe a racer it looks kind of like a race car driver yeah there's a Santa

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:59.920
there's a weird Viking looking one I guess it's definitely race because it says Mario

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:08.160
Motors on him there's also a little dress and dude I guess these are the Bowser marriage

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:15.640
these are the brutal the brutal yeah yeah one of those has been officially released like there is

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:19.800
a news piss on the switch channel and everything that's not the one that's in this picture though

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:27.600
that's the one of the green one with a hat yeah this is like a pretty dress and a weird-looking

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:38.480
courier typer or courtier type person and another one is a dude in a sombrero so that's all of the

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:46.400
brutal that's cool if you like collecting the outfits I'm sure that Nintendo is just gonna

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.520
gradually roll those out because they've been doing that for the past like a couple of months

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:55.240
it just it keeps Odyssey kind of fresh in people's mind the zombie one is a little surprising I

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.760
wouldn't be surprised if these are tied with holidays because you have the zombie one that

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:03.840
could be Halloween you have one that looks like George Washington Independence Day and Santa

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:13.160
Claus obviously that's gonna be st. Patrick's Day I mean so what about Hanukkah Mario Rob you know

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:19.440
they always ignore us for any holidays I know but there's like maybe five Jews in Japan maybe

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:24.000
toad is the Jewish one maybe maybe they're not there actually is a very large Jewish community

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.920
in Japan oh I didn't because even though they were allied with the Nazis during World War two they

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:37.400
did open their borders to Jewish refugees interesting history lesson there you go more than a bargain

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:43.520
for on oil art but no it's pretty much just all of the commercial holidays okay fair enough

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:49.360
race day I love race day I mean that's probably a Mario Kart tie-in they've been doing like the

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:56.760
Satellaview costume and like other Nintendo wait which one's the dress oh okay yeah yeah the girl

01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:02.840
brutal yeah there's three names so for Mario's quinceañera I think the wedding dress would work

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:08.920
for the quinceañera actually yeah it's honestly honestly like I I'm like when I hear these Mario

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.840
costume stories I'm like okay cool me I'm never gonna change out of the wedding dress like the

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:17.320
Mario on the wedding dress is the only way I can play Mario Odyssey because it's just it lends

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:21.960
itself to non-stop amazing screenshots I like playing with different hats and the wedding

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:27.280
dress because like the juxtaposition is crazy what you like to have a say-something hat I mean

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:34.160
you know that I've seen it I like I like going into the 8-bit Mario whenever you go into those

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:39.600
sections and seeing what the costume looks like mm-hmm that's always fun um for real though like

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.800
I thought I was always gonna play with the wedding dress but then they released the sunshine outfit

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:49.600
and I was like this is my aesthetic we're good okay fair enough all right I go to a chat over at

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:56.440
live dot vog and network comm Raginator in chat says costumes as DLC and Mario Odyssey reminds

01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:01.120
me of little big planet on PlayStation 3 another game that had tons and tons of costumes were they

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:05.440
it some you had to pay for some you didn't you would unlock as you play different levels it's

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.760
kind of a mix-and-match there especially if it was licensed you probably had to pay for it like

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:16.400
I remember having yes some of them you do they do those like it's like an actual like level pack

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:21.240
like I remember Pirates of the Caribbean one I got I kind of miss a little big planet like I know

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.800
that I know they did one on PlayStation 4 but it's been a few I'm ready for I'm ready for another

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.840
little bit got it yeah we got it free not too long ago well you're not gonna get a little big player

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.960
and get that was it dreams or whatever they call that now which is sort of like a little big plan

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.120
but not sure they'll have a little big planet costumes in there cool I guess all of those

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.320
costumes though have been free they aren't DLC in the fact that you have to buy them which makes

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:46.240
me think maybe they're doing all of this build-up to announce like DLC 83 or something like I'd be

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:50.160
so down for Mario Odyssey DLC I feel like they're not done with the game because they keep rolling

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:55.960
out new things you know with as much crap as we give Nintendo and online they do DLC very fucking

01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:01.720
well like their DLC stuff that they do is like really robust yeah I've already bought the

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:06.480
Splatoon DLC even though it's not even out yeah well sure but that's that's how they get you all

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:12.880
right let's move on we have more new speaking of a time to announce things right Logie right so

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.440
let's talk about III III is right around the corner just in June and we've already got the

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:23.760
press conference schedule so starting things off everything is still kind of walking and taking

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:30.480
place on the weekend before almost so Saturday you have EA which was June 9th at 11 p.m. Pacific

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:37.480
time so they're gonna have their conference then month or on Sunday they're gonna have of course

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:43.760
the Microsoft press event at 1 p.m. and then of course interrupting our show as they've done in

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:50.320
the last few years we have Bethesda fault certainly are shortly after and I hear rumors at least I

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:55.400
there was a rumored list of like some you know the Microsoft marketing rights for certain games

01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:01.960
and all their scroll six is on there and I'm like please so we'll see they're just gonna give us a

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:07.880
name yeah it's not gonna come out for years but I they have to really scatter out now it's time

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:13.840
for Elder Scrolls six no they need to release Skyrim on four more platforms nope six it's on

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:19.480
all the platforms it's not mobile yet but it's not on 3ds scroll six would be this year uh-huh

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:23.960
that's it you know what though we say like oh it wouldn't be for years but you know they've been

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.120
working on it for a long time though I think and they don't tend to announce shit until like it's

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:32.240
gonna come out that year like what do they have coming out this year I mean I don't really know

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:37.720
what their lineup is at all everything that they've announced is already out I think maybe doom 2 I

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:43.720
think would have been would be a logical choice like a doom 2 and perhaps I would have assumed

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:49.840
like a Fallout New Vegas type type of there could be a new like a remaster of Fallout New Vegas or

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:57.480
something like that maybe or just like a spin-off fallout with the Fallout 4 engine but I fuck if

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:03.440
it's Elder Scrolls 6 this year sign me up like you are allowed to interrupt OLR to announce

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:15.480
a new Elder Scrolls 6 anyways then on Monday of course we have Ubisoft at 1 p.m. Pacific and then

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:22.800
following that Nintendo is gonna have their thing on Tuesday at starting at 9 now what exactly

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.240
Nintendo's thing is gonna be well we've got a little bit more information regarding that so on

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:33.000
June 11th they're gonna do a Splatoon 2 World Championship and that's gonna be from 3 30 p.m.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:40.280
to 6 p.m. Pacific time with the finals on the 12th they're gonna have their video presentation at 9

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:48.040
a.m. on June 12th as well and of course they're gonna include Smash Brothers in that as you know

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.760
on top of other announcements they're gonna do the Nintendo treehouse live for three days

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:57.880
afterwards kind of similar to what they've done in the past and then Super Smash Brothers invitationals

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:04.360
2018 which is gonna be on June 12th they didn't see though which version of the game that is I

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:14.800
feel like it's got to be the Wii U one maybe who knows if the new one is an upgrade ish of the Wii

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:20.440
U one then they could do the new one yeah you mean if it's an enhanced remake kind of if it's

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:26.120
like I don't know it'll say Splatoon 2 to Splatoon 1 but some of the Splatoon players don't like that

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:31.600
comparison but anyway yeah so at least that's what's coming and just right around the corner

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:40.160
you'll not even like two months away in a month and a couple days I'm looking at chat over at

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:46.120
live.vognetware.com sj100 Matt says Bethesda will probably announce at least another mobile game

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:53.480
that will go live when the presentation is over that seems to be their deal okay they had the

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.840
fallout shelter they had a trading card game yeah I think they've kind of done that before

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.640
maybe it's got maybe a Skyrim an Elder Scrolls game that was a trading card game was Elder

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:08.480
Scrolls well shit uh dungeon buster says Elder Scrolls online is getting another expansion this

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:14.080
summer set in the Somerset region of Tamriel but I Elder Scrolls online I would think has kind of

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.040
like their own dedicated team at this point and like what they're doing doesn't really influence

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:23.800
the production yeah that that they that's already coming out so they may talk about a little bit

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:31.160
saying hey this just came out but I don't think it's gonna be SSJ 100 Matt suggests Wolfenstein

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:41.200
Nazi punching clicker game I'm in I'm in all right e3 look forward to it well this is a game

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:45.560
I know you're gonna see a lot of it e3 but we got some more information this week on shadow of the

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:50.800
Tomb Raider because there was a new trailer that showed up for the game that made its way online

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:56.960
and there was a panel that occurred at the Tribeca Film Festival of all places talking must be

01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.720
because of the movie where they were talking a little bit about shadow of the Tomb Raider and

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:05.720
it sounds like behind the scenes some press got to play about 45 minutes of the new game so you'll

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:09.120
probably see plenty more of this e3 this year but they're definitely ramping up for shadow of the

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:12.960
Tomb Raider which I'm assuming must be a holiday release this must be one of the big holiday

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:19.760
releases they talk about Laura goes from being being hunted to becoming the hunter she's smart

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:25.440
and resourceful and there's more stealth in the game I guess they have the game in the jungle this

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:31.080
time she goes from Mexico to Peru she has all the skills she got in the previous games so they had

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.520
to put her in an environment where she's still in danger and the jungle kind of works for that

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:39.680
dr. Dominguez is the name of the antagonist the head of Trinity they'll talk a little bit more

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:44.200
about that at e3 they also say the game is gonna have a lot of open exploration and will have a

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.280
lot of characters that can be met in the world apparently even in the first sequence there's

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:52.440
other people and you weren't really used to I mean you kind of would run into other people

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:56.400
here and there in the old Tomb Raider games but you're gonna definitely kind of see more people

01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:02.920
than this and also swimming underwater so Laura's learned to swim like well and there are I'm sure

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:07.080
she's got some things that keep her afloat I'm kidding okay and there are special things and

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:13.480
secrets to be found by taking risks and swimming deeper someone got the joke thank you all right

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:21.040
anyway there'll be more to come at e3 by the way just you know I das Montreal is actually making

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:25.200
this game it is not coming from Crystal Dynamics it's actually I das Montreal that's doing this

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:30.840
game so some people have asked well why is I das Montreal doing this and basically they they they

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:36.320
kind of gave a line about well since we did Deus Ex mankind divided it fits perfectly with Laura's

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.760
arc we're the perfect choice new it's new flavors you don't always want to do the same thing I don't

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.480
know why they just didn't fucking say Crystal Dynamics is doing the Marvel game we already

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:49.400
knew that they it's not a secret they announced that at last e3 the Crystal Dynamics is doing

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:55.560
this Marvel game so we were talking a little bit about how they're the rumors of like where they

01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:01.000
were trying to tie in like just cause and stuff like that with other you know properties within

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.520
this mm-hmm Marvel Universe we're gonna bring them into the Marvel Universe now because you know

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:14.520
no because Disney that's that's where things get complicated there but well I would imagine

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:21.320
this a Marvel game is something we've got to see more about it this I hope so but if if Shadow of

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:28.120
the Tomb Raider is kind of Square Enix is big kind of this side of the shores release for the

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:33.800
end of the year I would assume the Marvel project is maybe spring early summer next year to tie in

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:40.000
with the net because the the last move well I the last is it the last movie the next movie the next

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.400
Avengers movie that's the last part of this fit because I can't imagine they're gonna stop making

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:51.040
Avengers movies I don't the actors contracts are up after this next one or a lot of them it's they

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.960
have a way to deal with that based on the last movie so it'll be fine all right all right fine

01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:02.480
so fascinating whatever the the last known Avengers movie is next summer right because they they must

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:06.400
have done these two back-to-back right they said that it was gonna I think I saw on Twitter like

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:12.320
370 days so it's almost it's a little over a year from now okay so it's but it is is next is it's

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:18.080
2019 is the last movie which does not have a title because I guess that would be a spoiler okay the

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:24.240
title what I'm really a spoiler so I'll say no more but okay so I mean it would make a lot of

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:30.320
sense if crystal dynamics you know is gonna drop this you know what I imagine is going to be you

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:35.440
know if it's anything like the Tomb Raider reboot that game was fucking rad when it came out like it

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:39.320
really was kind of pushing the envelope you know and if they're gonna do that with Marvel and make

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:46.880
a heaven forbid good movie video game tie-in brace yourselves then or it could be terrible

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:50.880
Marvel Ultimate Alliance was pretty good yeah that's true that's true but I mean like something

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:56.200
on the level of like Tomb Raider with Marvel characters is gonna be badass I don't know how

01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.720
that would play but yeah I want to see what it is and we're just assuming that it's going to be

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:05.920
a Tomb Raider game with Marvel characters there's obviously they think they have an empty palette

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.560
they can do whatever they want but it would make a lot of sense I don't know dark soccer you like

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:16.360
Marvel would you play a Tomb Raider with Marvel characters yes yeah me too so I'm all for I really

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:21.840
just wanted Jessica Jones game she just walks around drinking and then punching people okay

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:28.200
so like Phoenix Wright but with Jessica Jones no I would like that no it needs it needs more

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:34.280
violence all right okay and she doesn't do courtroom so okay but like the investigative

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:39.400
part yeah but I don't want like Phoenix Wright so like Sam and more like instead of objection

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:45.280
it's just a punch I would maybe if it had to be like a visual novel so I'd want it to be more

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:52.200
like danganronpa okay but I'd rather it be like just a standard so you want a danganronpa game

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:59.120
with Jessica Jones not really I just want a game just like a standard more like L.A. noir maybe

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:04.640
okay but you know that type of game all right that's fair so well we'll see we'll see I'm

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:08.400
hoping this e3 we're gonna hear a little more about what that is because I'm assuming that's

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:14.640
gonna be a tie-in for the next Avengers movie release since we know it's only a year out so

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:18.960
some folks in chat are talking about Captain Marvel and how that's currently filming and

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:23.040
Tiger Claw says Captain Marvel is gonna be interesting because that movie is set in the

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:28.680
90s and we'll deal with the Scrolls so she has Rachel here all right I'm I'm looking forward

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:34.640
to not seeing it because I don't see any other Marvel like Rachel from Friends yes Oh the Rachel

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:41.160
the Rachel haircut yeah she has the Rachel haircut that's okay because I I love Carol Danvers as a

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:47.160
character which I was really disappointed that it was Trish and not Carol Danvers in the Jessica

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:55.280
Jones series cuz in alias in the pulse her BFF is Carol Danvers but I don't mind if we get a

01:22:55.280 --> 01:23:00.320
whole Carol Danvers movie that makes me happy how do you feel about Brie Larson I'm super happy

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:05.640
because I mean the last thing I saw her in was Scott Pilgrim oh right right oh my god like all

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:10.040
those actors and actresses of Scott Pilgrim like went on to like these huge things it's crazy yeah

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:15.400
so I like Brie Larson and she's got a great voice yeah and she's a Sacramento person isn't she

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:24.160
Sacramento actresses I think she is hmm her and that other redhead all right anyway let's move on

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:30.160
Dark Sakura what do you have for us well a game that I'm actually very interested in that has been

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:38.680
on my radar this week but it's a very interesting one not just for how it's played but the the

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:46.480
content as well but it's an interaction an interactive story it's it's a smartphone game

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:52.820
as well called bury me my love and it's about a woman named now or who's trying to escape the

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:59.080
civil war in Syria by fleeing to Europe and the story is told through text messages however it's

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:05.360
based on stories of actual Syrian refugees who you know are trying to communicate with people

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:12.960
back home to show their you know their experiences with this and it makes a very strong statement on

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:21.960
what these people are going through and of course the you know the reactions around the world and

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:29.640
on top of this too you actually get to see the results of your decisions almost immediately like

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:39.320
do you do you sleep somewhere dangerous do you try to pay to bypass dangerous places you know

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:45.560
and what the consequences of these actions are gonna be so and this is made by pixel hunt and

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:53.360
it looks amazing and I think it would make me cry and it's on both iOS and Android I like the concept

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:57.720
of the game where it's kind of like playing when you're not playing it type of thing mm-hmm how it

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:02.920
might send you like text messages as notifications and yeah it's kind of neat yeah that's a very

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:08.400
interesting interface and I just think I would cry so all right well you should download it and have

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:14.120
a cry you should download it and then support or if the refugees fair enough is there any tie-in

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:19.720
for fundraising for that to the game I didn't see sorry all right well there's other mobile games you

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:25.840
could play right look good yes in fact if you're a Harry Potter fan there's a new Hogwarts game

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:34.880
that's on mobile playing it Hogwarts mystery and basically the game has it takes place before the

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:41.960
actual events in the books so you're trying to investigate I guess your brother has run away or

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:46.440
been expelled from school and trying to figure that stuff out but the thing that everybody loves

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:52.440
the most about this and it's you know wonderful trope of mobile games is energy gotta love that

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:57.240
energy oh you want to do that action well I'm sorry you can't because of energy if only you

01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:04.080
had more energy and so that is one of the gripes that people have been making about the game is

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.480
that oh yeah you want to get out of the escape the devil's snare hope you have enough energy

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:12.840
you're gonna have to buy that with premium currency the dar Cyrus since you've been playing it have

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:17.760
you been annoyed by energy yet I'll be honest I haven't been playing get a whole bunch so she

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:21.760
probably hasn't hit the wall yet cuz usually usually you can play a good chunk of the game

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.240
where it keeps giving you items that will give you energy so you can go for a little while and

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:30.640
the BAM you hit a wall yeah I mean it looks cool to me you go to classes you learn spells and that

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:35.560
kind of stuff you can pick which house you're in so to be fair if it is a good game then you know

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:39.580
kicking a little money at it shouldn't be the end of the world it's kind of like you know Super

01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:44.080
Mario run if that was something you were into then you pay ten dollars and get the full game

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:49.840
right or you buy it for five dollars when it's on sale or that if you are lucky enough to get it at

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:54.200
that point but yeah I mean but it's I guess they chose not to go that route with this game where

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:58.680
they could have just had you hit a wall and say pay five bucks to pass they decided to do the

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:03.680
energy thing yes maybe because the five dollars ten dollars to pass thing didn't work out so well

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.080
for super because it works in other mobile games and maybe figure they're gonna make some money

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:14.040
that way maybe all right well I downloaded it but I haven't played it yet I'm looking forward

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:19.040
to Harry Potter wizards unite because of the whole AR gaming thing but we'll see I'm hoping

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:23.240
it'll let me be a Slytherin that'll be fun anyway before we get to the classic game of the week

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:26.800
let's talk about some twitch news it's only fair we talked about some mixer news how about some

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:32.760
twitch news so apparently now you know how you can give people bits on twitch which yeah when

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:37.640
you're watching my stream over at Rob Roberts cheap plug you can show me your biddies you can

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.740
give me biddies while I'm playing games and that actually basically you're giving me money which

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:46.960
who doesn't like money and honestly the money just goes to pay for all this stuff here at OLR

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:53.240
like I just paid the hosting bill for the network this week and yeah but anyway no it's fine it's

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:59.280
fine um but obviously money helps buy new games and who doesn't like a little bit of money there

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:07.640
are now more ways to incorporate bit stuff onto your stream and that is through extensions so now

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:13.260
twitch has released a variety of extensions that will actually interact with bit donations for

01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:19.220
example there's one for League of Legends where you can predict winners and stuff using bits I

01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:23.460
don't know if that means it's like a gambling thing where you might win bits if you predict

01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:27.220
correctly me it's kind of sounds like that a little bit like you might be doing gambling

01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:31.620
with bits I don't want to quote that until I've tried this myself because that could get very

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:37.740
interesting if you're like gambling without gambling yeah it's currency that you're buying

01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:41.860
that you're gambling with it's like pachinko it could be interesting I don't know but there's also

01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:46.660
things like voting studios so you can actually like make a poll and then in order to vote in

01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:53.140
the poll you would have to donate biddies to do that so you know as somebody who does some live

01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:58.340
streaming and who is an affiliate on Twitch I'm I think this is cool for people that will be into

01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:03.340
it but like you know I don't I don't know I don't want to do like voting based on how much money you

01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:10.220
give me that's just for me that's how it works in the real world Rob I it's just accuracy well

01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:16.820
played well play well I I don't want the NRA donating to the polls on my stream or any of

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:21.780
that stuff but I don't know I would have to see maybe for the right integration like there's some

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:27.140
where you can play games with the streamer and things like that and maybe I don't know but I

01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:32.300
don't know if I I see the right fit for that yet I like to do as much stuff as possible for free

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:37.940
and then if you feel so inclined watch an ad and throw the bits at me like that's that's you know

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:45.340
even if it's just five cents ten cents you know what y'all it adds up it adds up all right let's

01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:49.900
see s 200 Matt and chat over at live dog network comm says predict Rob will scream at this one

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:54.020
scary part in this jump scare game yep that's something you could do a biddies if you wanted

01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:58.100
to or be even better if it was like you know how they have the twitch integration with different

01:29:58.100 --> 01:30:04.460
games where you can like send a jump scare and pay some biddies to send a job maybe maybe yeah

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:09.460
pay some biddies to get jump scared oh I bet I bet that could be a thing the developers have to

01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:12.700
kind of put that in the game though I don't know if that would be through extensions I should point

01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:18.380
out to the other interesting thing about the extensions with biddies is that you only get as

01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:24.420
the streamer you get 80% of the bitty money you don't get the full hundred percent that you do

01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:28.880
if somebody just tips you or whatever you only get 80% because you know where the other 20% is

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:33.860
going the extension developer yeah to promote them to keep doing extensions so that's something

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:38.020
else to think about too is that if I use it through extensions I'm actually kind of getting

01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:43.380
less money although maybe I'm incentivizing getting more so it's it's a lot to think about

01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:48.940
I don't know all right anyhow let's let's go back to a simpler time when you know what there was no

01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:54.100
there was no way to live stream your game during Sega's really weird arcade phase right I think I

01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:59.180
think you still had to have a camcorder on your shoulder if you wanted to film this right anyway

01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:03.140
it's the classic game of the week where dark soccer is gonna step into the gaming vault and

01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:09.420
find a game that she thinks hey you brats never came out at home as far as I know all right here

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:13.300
it is the classic game of the week dark soccer would you pick this week I picked a game called

01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:20.420
brave firefighters also known as show bullshit brave firefighters in Japan it is a light gun

01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:28.980
game and it was the as I recall the first Hikaru game for the Sega Hikaru software came out in 1999

01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:35.980
it has a vibrating light gun control it's in the shape of a fire hose you can fight the fires

01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:43.300
because the fires need to be thought so you can save your pot stash like Willie Nelson actually

01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:50.180
that was a true story anyway and it was as I said the first title that came out for the Hikaru

01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:55.900
system and it was also at the time the most technically advanced game of its time it was

01:31:55.900 --> 01:32:02.380
the first one that used Fong shading and now it's the most common shading technique had some

01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:09.580
really great lighting and particle fire effects and one of the most detailed environments so this

01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:14.580
particular game have you ever played this Rob I think I've seen it I feel like one of the because

01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:19.620
this is like it was only released in Japan right um no really it came out in the US I feel like I

01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:23.380
saw it somewhere but it was like at an import arcade like either like I don't see arcade

01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:29.300
infinity but another one of those type of places I saw it in I want to see one of those like

01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:35.740
Koreatown arcades I think I saw this in Las Vegas okay yeah that's when I played it yeah but anyway

01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:42.220
the story is that there is an electrical fault that caused the Whitehead Hotel to go up in flames

01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:47.420
and Mayor Taylor and his family are trapped inside so you have to go through and put out the fires

01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:55.380
and rescue the mayor and his family so you can you hold the drainage button on the hose control

01:32:55.380 --> 01:33:01.580
to release the steam a stream of water but you will deplete your water gauge as you go forward

01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:10.980
so you can also twist the nozzle to have like a fog effect that can extinguish fires and flying

01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:15.660
sparks as well as destroy obstacles that are in your path you have a time limit for each stage

01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:21.100
but you get extra seconds if for each fire that's extinguished quickly and of course when the time

01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:27.420
runs out the game ends there was a modified version of brave firefighters that was donated

01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:34.460
to the Kyoto Kyoto City disaster prevention center that a different scenario and opening

01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:44.380
movie and no time limit so I guess it was for I guess teaching disaster relief but anyway this

01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:52.180
particular game again it was notable for being the first Hikaru game which as in essence it was

01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:59.820
a modified version of the NAOMI hardware system it had a custom Sega graphics chip larger memory

01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:07.100
capacity and they made those modifications for the sake of releasing brave firefighters because

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:13.860
the engineering the engineers had difficulty creating 3d images of the flame and the water

01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:24.100
with the NAOMI capability so there you go it led us to all kinds of new innovations that really

01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:34.300
was the big big thing about it it was produced by Rikiya Nakagawa and it came out in 1999 that's

01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:41.220
about it it was one of those like I said it's that weird era of Sega games yeah but that's

01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:48.900
like the cool stuff honestly it is it is and as far as like other stuff that was that came out

01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:57.580
for Hikaru I mean I've already covered Planet Harriers which really I think did like the really

01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:03.740
the best I think made the most of the of the system but other of the Hikaru games was the

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:08.580
NASCAR arcade Planet Harriers Starward Racer arcade air tricks which we played a lot of that

01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:17.180
and virtual on force and Hikaru was succeeded by NAOMI too so there you go all right s2100

01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:21.900
Matt in our chat says this running water gameplay sound will make all the podcast listeners want to

01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:36.900
pee for sure well it is a game about fire hoses anyway there it is your classic game of the week

01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:41.180
brave firefighters there were all kinds of games like that they were coming out at the time

01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:50.020
remember oh yeah like we had what was the Konami ones we had the mocap games like the punch mania

01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:53.780
or whatever was called those punch mania but I'm trying to think of what was the police 911 oh

01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:59.020
yeah please no one was one and there was like a boxing one too right yeah I remember that but

01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:04.380
man that was and I think like what did deadstorm pirates come out on dark to see us as mocap golf

01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:13.060
yeah that was it yeah but I'm trying to remember when deadstorm pirates came out it was it wasn't

01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:19.260
one of the Sega games was it maybe not all right well you look into that while we take a break

01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:22.740
we're gonna take a break and when we come back there's plenty more of Orange Lounge radio to

01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:21.540
the show there's there's a little bit of caffeine there's enough caffeine to hopefully starve off

01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:42.860
this too Rob's got everything I don't have the whole Animal Crossing series I don't think the

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:46.860
Animal Crossing ones have costumes in Odyssey yeah they don't work for the Mario games they're fine

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:51.980
whatever sorry I was gonna say though JD because you mentioned we didn't have an opportunity to

01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:55.980
bring this up earlier in the show we should mention it now so JD's been spending the weekend

01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:01.260
with me and we've been you know doing doing such manly things like yesterday we went and

01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:07.660
got mani pedis it was so much fun and it was oh my god I don't know why more dudes don't allow

01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:11.780
themselves just go get mani pedis because seriously my nails have never looked better

01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:19.020
like and I don't okay now JD went the extra route and went with a glitter blue color so like his

01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:25.420
nails are like like nails so I did like a lighter turquoise on my hands and like a deep like royal

01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:32.700
blue on my toes okay do you remember when we had Steve here for Flom yeah he always has his done

01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:37.300
yeah I mean and honestly my nails don't look good well here's the I didn't I they're they're quote

01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:41.860
unquote painted but it's clear yeah and the only reason I had them do the clear is that a it does

01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:47.660
look really good but B it makes me not bite them and so like honestly like the best tip if you bite

01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:51.300
your nails you want to stop doing it like paint your nails clear used to never stop me because

01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:56.580
really oh my god so disgusting those are trying to eat a switch cartridge it would I would just

01:38:56.580 --> 01:39:00.740
peel all of it off in this to go back to chewing but I'm always like okay I'm always like disgusted

01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:05.020
and I was a kid though I'm also just I'm disgusted and fascinated when they do the nails because they

01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:08.860
don't just they don't just trim the nails like they dig the whole thing into the cuticles to

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:13.180
like help prevent hang nails and stuff like that and I'm always like shocked at how much shit they

01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:17.660
get it I'm like oh my god that's all on my this is what the sad thing is that cuticle is actually

01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:22.300
do serve a purpose yeah except that people have started taking it off to make it look like you've

01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:27.180
got a longer nail bed mm-hmm I mean that's the whole thing for it but I think that you know

01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:32.860
keeping it I'd say trimmed like at least every month or so you know promotes healthy growth so

01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:39.020
I need I need to I'm probably gonna go get all mine done before drag con well but if you're not

01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:44.060
wearing nails you're not doing drag I got I'm saying you can you can get just a manicure

01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:48.380
pedicure without having your nails like done yeah use basically basically it's like getting

01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:53.580
a haircut you don't know in there and get it died and I want a white gel base cut hmm but I

01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:59.020
want gels just to have something that Alan have that done not that long ago he had like the blue

01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:03.620
gel it looked really good even though it's like you know you don't see a lot of dudes with their

01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:07.060
nails painted but it looked really good but it was like dang that's like permit he had to go in

01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:10.820
it took him like 30 minutes to get it off yeah cuz you have to soak them off yeah yeah but Rob

01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:15.540
if you get the gels you won't be able to bite your nails that's because they're like they're

01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:20.420
really yeah that's true but I always recommend because I had them glued on once and it ruined

01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:25.020
my remember when we didn't allow to my nails were so thin and hurt to the touch oh yeah that was

01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:30.060
because they glued them on and I reacted to the glue so you always should have them build on top

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:33.660
of the natural nail you know and if you play a lot of DDR or pump it up you should treat yourself

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:40.260
to a pedicure because yeah or if you that athlete you know athletes have to get pedicures like all

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:44.700
the time because they fuck up their feet yeah so Loki have you ever had a mani-pedi you should

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:48.420
consider getting one done now that's a lot of fun it's fun we'll go some time dance dance and he

01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:52.140
would go with me because there's two nails are atrocious and I can't do anything with them there

01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:57.820
you go all right I'm his esthetician all right let's move on we got to get back to video games

01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:02.660
you have to have those perfect fingers to hold controllers so that the big old you know gross

01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:08.500
nails don't get in the way anyway to register participation for this week's episode of orange

01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:15.260
lounge radio at fog network comm use the passphrase teacher let's get into some rapid fire news and

01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:20.060
talk about some other news that has happened this week rapidly Loki let's talk about my favorite

01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:26.980
topic when it comes to Nintendo and that's online it's still coming out September at least whatever

01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:32.220
they have planned however they're gonna be talking about what it is that's gonna be coming out in

01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:40.820
September it's gonna be revealed in May so this is coming from the current president Tatsumi Kimi

01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:47.580
Shima basically say that Nintendo switch online a paid subscription service that will expand the

01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:52.580
online functionality of the switch will begin in September of this year the service will provide

01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:57.860
consumers with a richness of online features that allow them to continuously enjoy Nintendo switch

01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:04.540
more from hot air hot air I know it's like this doesn't tell me jack shit I do know that they have

01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:10.820
the costs listed online but we still don't know exactly what that will entail and it says it's

01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:16.180
gonna have access to a library of classic games I just wish they would still like I don't don't

01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:20.220
be wrong I think it's cool that they want to do like a Netflix type thing where you have access

01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:25.580
to stuff but the same time just let me buy things like it's worked for the other systems why now

01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:31.060
do you okay I'm I'm all for a Netflix style classic thing that would just you could play

01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:36.980
whatever you want that would be an amazing deal oh my god but did you notice I don't think it

01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:41.100
comes up later in the show where I hope I'm not spoiling a story but there was a bunch of

01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:46.880
trademarks by Nintendo this week on things like dr. Mario and some other Mario games so and my

01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:51.260
brain went to because some people are like oh they're gonna redo these games so no these are

01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:57.060
probably the first releases on this Nintendo online probably dr. Mario would make a lot of

01:42:57.060 --> 01:43:02.660
sense a lot of sense as a debut game especially if this is whole you can play with friends across

01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:08.580
the internet dr. Mario makes a fuck of a lot of sense as a game to include with this to start and

01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:12.820
I'm fine if those games have that functionality but I would also like it like if I don't care

01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:16.700
about playing over the other people they just be able to purchase the virtual console games

01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:23.060
you've released on a few systems already yeah I mean why I'm sure Nintendo will happily take your

01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:31.740
money in whatever form you want to give it to him we'll see I don't know anyways and then of course

01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:37.220
we talked about it a couple weeks ago about how the rock star was basically giving polling some

01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:45.660
music from Grand Theft Auto 4 in regards to most of us was to be from the the Russian radio station

01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:50.220
that was in the game but apparently it's not just that so there are several different stations are

01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:57.260
affected by this and even like a lot of the rock songs so they even had like of David Bowie songs

01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:04.620
taken from the game I know I kind of went through the whole list of stuff thankfully the some of the

01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:11.140
songs I did listen to quite a bit are still in the game but some are not in the ones that they

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:18.060
replace them with are kind of lame I don't know and I I find it frustrating though like and I

01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:23.060
understand why that they have to patch this out now because they're still selling the game it

01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:27.460
would be different than like say if they sold the game and then they weren't selling it anymore and

01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:32.820
so the other licenses expired there's nothing that they're gonna really do to the game but now it's

01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:38.700
still some active thing that it's just gonna be removed from it so if you have a console version

01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:44.700
the game you're kind of screwed however if you're on PC people have already found ways to put back

01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:50.820
the removed songs into the game so if you are you know bothered by that course they did then you can

01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:56.780
go ahead and do that and of course if you have like a PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 version of that

01:44:56.780 --> 01:45:03.060
those games then you can always keep your console offline if you want to keep your you know songs in

01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:08.980
there honestly I mean it's disappointing I did like a lot of the Russian songs that were in the

01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:13.820
game but I it wasn't one of the main stations I listened to I mean it wasn't the first the

01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:19.060
granted out for that was before you know the validate Tony and lost in the dam where they

01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:23.700
added more a whole nother I think dance music station so I listened to the rest of the station

01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:32.260
because it was mostly it was Russian music and dance music which why okay all right well moving

01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:37.620
on to talk about Nintendo Splatfest the next Splatfest has been announced and it's it's a

01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:41.420
little different it's not kind of the same that they've been doing for other Splatfest because

01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:47.140
this is gonna be a three-parter because it is to determine who is your favorite Ninja Turtle and

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:52.500
so the first round starts this next weekend which will be Raphael versus Leonardo will be the first

01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:59.460
matchup Raphael Leonardo actually round two will be Mike Michelangelo or Mikey versus Donny did they

01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:04.580
shorten all the names Donatello yeah Donatello that's what they call them now the new Nickelodeon

01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:11.220
series all right Mikey and Donny then around two and then the finals will be May 18th and obviously

01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:15.060
Donatello is the best and should be the one that everybody picks although I don't know how these

01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:20.140
new ones are I'm thinking Donatello from back in the day so maybe maybe it's different it's always

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:27.100
the best this is probably the first splat I'm not gonna you just you're really I can't be bothered

01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:31.220
with this huh I mean Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was never my thing plus we could have had the

01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:36.060
Japan one and I'm so mad well let's talk about the Japan one actually since you brought it up so

01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:42.020
Japan doesn't really have the same thing with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles so instead the San

01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:47.380
Rio character collaboration ranking contest is happening in Japan voting for the event starts on

01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:52.860
May 10th there will be characters represented in a crossover including Splatoon 2 cross San

01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:57.380
Rio I but then there's a cute little Hello Kitty dressed up as an inkling type of thing it looks

01:46:57.380 --> 01:47:01.060
adorable I don't know if that means they're getting like a San Rio Splatfest or what that

01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:05.260
is we don't know exactly understanding but that's probably what it is Hello Kitty versus Bats

01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:09.660
Maru I would so be about that that would be amazing why can't they do that over here as well

01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:15.980
I'm right good question good fucking question it's it's weird some of the marketing choices

01:47:15.980 --> 01:47:20.860
that they've made because they've done like McDonald's Splatfest in Japan only and I'm like

01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:27.660
you'd think that if they were gonna do that there well it was like chicken nuggets versus fries I

01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:32.460
mean it was like dude you can't put anything up against fries fries are always gonna win

01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:37.300
but chicken McNuggets already good see see now we have a Splatfest already but the point was

01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:42.380
like McDonald's is just such a very classic American thing that I'm surprised they didn't

01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:48.660
decide to do it here yeah you know they need to do here is the flavorings like they have at

01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:54.220
McDonald's in Japan right oh they already did that disgusting ketchup and mayonnaise why no

01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:57.940
it's like ketchup and mustard no I'm talking about that you put them in the bag and shake

01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:06.540
them up and they have like a curry flavor and here with the fries too they have like flavored

01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:13.260
fries that's right they did they had the shaker bags McDonald's and they sucked ass so like it

01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:19.660
wasn't curry it was like ranch flavor it'd be amazing ranching they have like garlic parmesan

01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:23.300
like ooh I like garlic parmesan and they tried it on the fries like wow these ruin the fries

01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:27.540
well I'm never doing that again I don't trust McDonald's to have good food I was just saying

01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:32.100
it's popular here because it's all right all right we're turning too much into orange on foodio

01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:37.500
let's bring it back to games talking about the next somebody's doing classic games on the switch

01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:42.900
that's for sure but it is it's neo geo that's actually doing those games on the switch it is

01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:49.420

Quest 10 who is who just saw a gene has announced that he's leaving school Winnick's he got his

01:49:55.500 --> 01:50:02.780
start as an assistant for the creator of Hori Yuji in the 1990s he has worked on most of the Dragon

01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:09.460
Quest games since then and now that he was the director he is going to step away from the

basically what he said is I who do you saw I'm leaving Square Enix I apologize for the sudden

01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:30.020
announcement well that is quite I hope he's okay maybe he's old enough to enjoy retirement who knows

01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:38.460
he's still a young guy oh well maybe maybe he's going to join the collective with all those other

01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:43.420
people who have departed companies to do their own thing maybe he just got really frustrated one day

01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:50.220

01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:58.140
you won't be playing Dragon Quest 10 here in the US anytime soon but what will you be playing Loki

01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:03.860
you'll be playing a re-release of battle zone gold edition this is the one that I think they had

01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:09.940
is a PlayStation VR game now it's not VR and it's on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox one although I'm

01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:15.220

the switch has Donkey Kong tropical freeze that is coming out in Japan this week on May 3rd but

01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:10.220
that's honestly like the only big release that's catching my eye here I was trying to see if maybe

01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:14.260
I missed something on like the 3ds or the Vita but it just looks like it is a very slow release

01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:19.540
week this week in Japan checking the Vita real quick to make sure to miss anything yeah no

01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:24.500

01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:34.260
work for is a big Warhammer gamer which we found out when we were talking about like cons and stuff

01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:40.100
it was yeah I've seen actually the big con you know full-scale Warhammer things are pretty

01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:46.700
exciting to watch but pretty terrible to prepare for all right well this is usually the part of the

01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:50.660
show where we would visit the mail bag and participate at orange laundry calm to read all

01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:53.940
those lovely emails you send us I found dust bunnies but I believe we have an empty mail

01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:59.980

01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:22.260
so if it's tacos though tacos would be great but if it's food we're down for that too so participate

01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:26.060
at orange laundry calm I want to hear from every listener so I know how many listeners we have

01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:31.700
tacos are amazing all right because I don't know I forgot the password to look at all our stats so

01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:37.380
like I don't even know how many listeners we have anymore all right so moving on let's get into some

01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:43.780
more gaming news Loki all right so things are kind of getting ridiculous as far as the whole

01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:51.460
pub G cheans sorry goes so you may remember there was a group of people that were making certain

01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:58.140
subscription cheat services for pub G and they made quite a billion or quite a bit of money off

01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:05.380
of that of course they found themselves in so with some legal trouble with bluehole now there's

01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:13.500
actually been arrests and fines being placed on them so they had 15 suspects that were arrested

01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:20.500
for developing hack programs hosting marketplaces for hack programs and brokering transactions the

01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:27.500
currently the suspects have been fined approximately 5.1 million dollars and then other suspects

01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:33.460
related to the case are still being investigated sucks to be them dude I didn't know you could go

01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:38.940
to jail for cheating in an online game well I think it's more than just it's probably making

01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:45.940
the cheats and you know still though come on it's a fucking game what kind this is in the US no okay

01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:51.100
so it's other other countries is against the law yeah yeah that's what it is so wow all right I

01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:56.820
guess they take that stuff seriously but seriously though like I get it I get yeah it's bad that they

01:55:56.820 --> 01:56:02.060
you're cheating yeah you know shut them down do a cease and desist and all that shit but really

01:56:02.060 --> 01:56:07.900
arresting people and fighting them 5.1 million dollars haven't we talked about a spanking like

01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:11.740
I'm not talking about a caning or any of that stuff I'm talking about you need to take them

01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:15.820
and spank them and say you've been very very naughty it's super nanny needs to come out and

01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:20.340

01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:51.460
blue hole doing this because these are the same fucking people are like you copied us we're

01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:56.380
fucking pissed off so we're suing you because you use a fucking frying pan in your fucking game so

01:56:56.380 --> 01:57:05.420
yes I could see them doing some bullshit like this all right anyhow guys you don't chat at

01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:11.620
live.vog network.com wants to know how the fuck did that nanny show stay on TV so long there's a

01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:16.540
lot of shows isn't a friend dresser was great because she was also in UHF and this is final

01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:22.860
tap The Simpsons I think has officially become the longest-running scripted series on television

01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:29.780
ever and that is a show that stopped being funny a long time ago and we still have more episodes

01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:35.980
of them and yeah same boat but what can you do all right SHO 100 Matt suggests they should all

01:57:35.980 --> 01:57:47.060
have to endure a yelling by the God Warrior lady this is dark-sided I do miss wife swap that was a

01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:53.340
fun that was a good show good times it sounds like a completely different show actually I wife swap

01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:59.460
was the ABC show God Warrior was on the Fox version was the trading spouses oh same shit

01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:04.940
big difference oh no no cuz that that God Warrior is better than anything that was ever on one of

01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:11.180
those names is a pun I think trading spouses is a pun off of trading spaces I think it is yeah I

01:58:11.180 --> 01:58:17.220
think you're right all right anyway moving on this is unfortunately not really a humorous piece of

01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:22.340
news because this has to tie into things that have happened in the real world and how they can yes

01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:28.060
impact the side of video games especially the business side of games so a game was supposed

01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:33.500
to be released on the switch the PlayStation 4 and Xbox this week Xbox one this week with its

01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:39.620
different ports that game was called Death Road to Canada and I'm sure you can imagine why it may

01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:45.300
be in poor taste for a game with that title to come out right now because of the horrific incident

01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:50.020
that happened in Toronto earlier this week so developer rocket cat games and publisher

01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:55.780
Yukio publishing have delayed the title indefinitely with a statement that says we

01:58:55.860 --> 01:58:59.820
feel it would be deeply inappropriate to launch the game at such a time we would like to express

01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:05.740
our deepest condolences to everyone affected by the tragic events in Toronto so they've they've

01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:09.820
stopped this indefinitely I don't think that means they'll never put them out but they'll

01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:14.500
probably push it back to around the holiday or you know a time when hopefully people have been

01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:19.340
able to heal a little bit from the craziness that happened there it should be pointed out now this

01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:24.380
article says Death Road to Canada makes no references to aggravated assault but like if

01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:29.660
you actually look at the game you do play like you're in a car and you're a person in the car

01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:33.380
but you're like an animal you play this little dog that kind of drives around in the car and

01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:38.900
you're like fucking shooting and running over people but they're zombies so because they're

01:59:38.900 --> 01:59:46.700
zombies it's okay but obviously you can see where it's a little too close to events in the real

01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:51.900
world right now so they've had to delay it so it's just kind of goes to show that sometimes

01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:56.620
events that happen in the real world they can have an impact on gaming especially because you know

01:59:56.620 --> 02:00:01.500
it would have been kind of shitty business sense to release a game like that right now you know one

02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:05.700
of those news networks would have done a very exploitative piece about it so just now is not

02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:11.740
the time for pit bulls holding shotguns to shoot down zombies and drive over them in their car I

02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:16.580
will just come out later it is on steam if you want to play the game I will tell you if there's

02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:23.900
ever a video game that one made into a movie that sounds awesome well anyway it is on steam if you

02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:28.500
do want to judge for yourself and there's trailers available online and all that stuff so yeah there

02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:34.940
you go I'm going in chat over at live dot vog network comm s to 100 Matt reminds us there were

02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:40.180
a ton of games that got delayed due to 9-eleven you know when that happened that also 9-eleven

02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:46.140
had impact on movies TV all of it oh yeah yeah well like other shows too like Buffy had an

02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:51.980
episode they delayed because of Columbine yep yep I remember 9-eleven because that caused that show

02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:56.100
the mole to get really erratic schedule that was my favorite reality game show that was ever on TV

02:00:56.100 --> 02:01:00.260
the Anderson Cooper hosted and that show was amazing I didn't really see hosted that yeah

02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:03.780
Anderson Cooper hosted them all the first yeah it was before his big CNN stuff and all that

02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:11.260
still have gray hair back then yes he did yes he did so he went great really early so I you should

02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:16.260
and he looked fabulous doing it he was a great host I was still upset with him though you should

02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:24.500
what are you over Kathy Griffin oh he was such a shit to her over the whole yeah yeah not as bad

02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:31.300
as Andy Cohen well Andy Cohen is also but anyway look you should go check out Anderson Cooper in

02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:34.540
his prime on the mole and that was the best reality game show there ever was I'm almost

02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:40.380
positive it's all on YouTube if you look up the mole season one but season two was displaced by

02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:46.580
9-eleven because they it got terrible ratings because people didn't you know that they've got

02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:52.340
boosted back because the news coverage was on else it just it never had a chance it's like the dark

02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:55.660
shadows revival which I feel like we talked about on the show a few weeks ago the dark shadows

02:01:55.660 --> 02:02:01.460
revival got screwed up because the Gulf War coverage so anyway Kai's you don't chat says

02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:07.180
the mole was the shit they fucked it up with celebrity mole ironically now spoiler alert for

02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:13.300
a show that is well over 10 years old at this point but Kathy Griffin won celebrity mole one

02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:18.820
of the time she was on it but it was not Anderson Cooper was done being the whole host they had

02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:24.060
somebody else a moderate shot I think was sport they moved on to sports personalities hosting it

02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:28.340
and I think he was the one that hosted it that season when Kathy Griffin won that sounds like

02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:34.500
the worst choice for a reality show host sports personality he wasn't as good as it he did okay

02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:39.140
but he wasn't Anderson Cooper it was just like I don't remember the guy they tried to do a revival

02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:46.380
of the mole oh god it was probably 2010 2011 they did a new season of the mole it was the mole

02:02:46.380 --> 02:02:53.340
season 5 and they had another sports guy doing it and I don't remember his name but it just it

02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:58.820
just didn't work it was still a decent show but it just wasn't the same as the first two seasons

02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:03.220
which were amazing didn't they do like an international version too well the mole was

02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:06.900
an international show it started it started in the Netherlands where I think all our good

02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:10.700
reality TV comes from that's what I'm thinking cuz like survivors from their big brothers from

02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:18.460
there all of it yeah so anyway um phantasm chat over at live dog network comm says people think

02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:23.900
Toronto in the center of the universe in Canada but there's other cities too yes Canada is a very

02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:28.020
very very big place people sometimes forget that it's a it's a bigger country than the US believe

02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:32.700
it or not but I mean if there's a lot of less there's a lot of lowly populated areas because

02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:36.740
the closer you get to the North Pole and all that but if you have a national tragedy like it's

02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:40.740
sensitive should delay it like it doesn't matter that there's other parts of Canada like they're

02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:48.700
being sensitive oh for sure for sure anyway um Tiger Claw chat says could a new mole work in

02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:54.020
today's climate fuck yeah it could I don't know who owns the rights to it here but I always see

02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:58.140
I love the mole I'm getting into my like soapbox that really doesn't have anything to do with

02:03:58.140 --> 02:04:02.820
gaming but it's game show so it's kind of adjacent um here's the thing the mole to me

02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:06.780
part of the reason I loved it is it was very James Bond in the types of things that they had to do

02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:12.020
and if you didn't know this premise of the mole basically it was that you have ten contestants

02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:16.780
and they all do these challenges to put money in the pot and at the end of the game one of them is

02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:22.420
gonna win all the money but one of the contestants is the mole and they are working against to try to

02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:27.500
fuck up the pot basically and as much money as they can keep out of the pot they get some type

02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:32.180
of stipend from the producers and so forth so at the end of every episode they have to take a

02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:36.900
test the contestants take a test who is the mole and that's part probably part of the reason why

02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:41.500
the show wasn't as glamorous because there's no voting there's no whatever you take a test they

02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:45.540
did have they called it coalitions which was basically alliances where you could kind of

02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:49.380
collaborate notes with people and try to figure it out but you know then the mole would get

02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:53.700
involved in that shit too and fuck players up so you would take these tests and whoever got the

02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:57.580
lowest score at the end was executed at the end of the episode that's the caught they said welcome

02:04:57.580 --> 02:05:03.940
to your first execution this is the results of the quiz and it was like suspenseful ass-clenching

02:05:03.940 --> 02:05:08.780
television the way they did like because Anderson Cooper would like look around the room and he'd be

02:05:08.780 --> 02:05:13.660
like whoever the contestant I don't remember he'd be like Jamie and he would type the name into the

02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:17.940
computer and he'd press enter and there would be like the longest fucking pause and then it would

02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:22.980
go go green and that means they're safe or it would go red and if it went red it would go

02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:28.100
like that and basically Anderson Cooper would walk over to the contestant say please come with me and

02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:31.660
pick them up take them out of the room to the car that's it like the other contestants couldn't hug

02:05:31.660 --> 02:05:37.820
them say goodbye or anything like that just up out and that was awesome like did the odd do you

02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:41.900
find out who the mole is at the end or do you know from the get-go of course you didn't know you find

02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:47.340
out at the end because they leave they left clues in every episode and so at the very end they say

02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:51.700
here was the clue in episode one here was the clue in episode two then they tell you what the

02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:55.980
clues were to the mole's identity and some of them were really stupid and I think that's part

02:05:55.980 --> 02:06:02.620
of why the fifth season didn't work is that one of the clues was so obvious and ridiculous like it

02:06:02.620 --> 02:06:07.980
kind of ruined it I think so I'm not gonna spoil it in case now because I'm actually excited people

02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:12.420
sound interested in it they might go back and watch it but the first couple seasons were pretty

02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:17.100
decent with the clues some were a stretch but you know they didn't want the internet was still kind

02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:20.580
of coming alive in that age and they didn't want people to get out on the internet and say who it

02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:24.780
was and ruin it for everybody but you would you would find out in the last episode who it was the

02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:30.820
season with BB Zahara Benet really stretched BB Zahara Benet was not on the mole she was the mole

02:06:30.820 --> 02:06:38.860
she's not the mole going to chat over at live.voggannetwork.com there's actually comments here

02:06:38.860 --> 02:06:43.700
Kaijuto says they could make the mole into a video game or a board game too I feel like there was a

02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:47.700
tie-in that didn't happen I will okay I'm gonna tell you what I'll tell you one more thing about

02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:53.860
the mole that I thought was brilliant so it was the end of the first episode so you know how like

02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:59.260
everybody has their luggage that they go on or whatever on a trip or whatever so Anderson Cooper

02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:05.020
says okay so here is the test I'm gonna ask you all trivia questions about the other players and

02:07:05.020 --> 02:07:10.380
you're not allowed to confer with each other this challenge is called the burning bags over here on

02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:15.620
a forklift we have your bags every time you answer a question wrong they will be lowered slowly into

02:07:15.620 --> 02:07:21.580
this fire if you get three questions wrong your bags will be burned and so what happens like the

02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:26.340
first three questions they get wrong and so all of their bags burn and they're all fucking crying

02:07:26.340 --> 02:07:33.500
and shit because like someone's like like they're all like losing their shit but then spoiler alert

02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:37.140
at the very beginning of the next episode you find out they were just fucking with them those

02:07:37.140 --> 02:07:45.620
are fake bags yeah like as you're watching you're like this is so fucking cruel I can't what this is

02:07:45.620 --> 02:07:51.700
like this is mean television so far and then it turns out oh just like that one show they have

02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:56.620
never they had like that one show it was like the the Joe project or something like that is basically

02:07:56.620 --> 02:08:02.900
it's one dude so they think they've made him seem think that he was on a reality show but it wasn't

02:08:02.900 --> 02:08:09.060
actually a reality show we were just fucking with him the entire time but then in the fifth season

02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:15.060
they did something like it again but they did it with their journals they did the place where they

02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:19.500
take all the notes they said here's your journals and we're gonna look and they really did it like

02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:25.180
they got it wrong and the journals all got burned and it was like well they have no more notes but

02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:30.080
that's different because the journals were just simply for the purposes of you know reviewing

02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:34.000
notes and stuff like that and I think there was another twist where they had to like they had to

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:39.520
give the journal to somebody else so anyway I could I could just do like a podcast for 700

02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:45.280
episodes about the mole and what a great show it was so if anybody out there has the power to bring

02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:49.180
the mole back to television you should do it and I will happily host it and I will be as good as

02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:53.080
Anderson Cooper have you ever found a social media version like you know you play this Facebook

02:08:53.080 --> 02:09:00.080
reality games thank you for bringing that up no I they did do a version on live journal of the

02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:05.960
mole I never played it but I watched it and it was you know that as good as it can be for a live

02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:10.200
journal game but part of the what made the mole really exciting was that they were traveling to

02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:14.520
all these extravagant locations like I remember the first season ended they did the big reveal

02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:18.640
and like this giant Coliseum in Spain you know and it was like they were going to all these like

02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:22.920
crazy-ass location that's what made a very James Bond so and then that's why the celebrity mole

02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:28.600
was stupid because celebrity mole was like we're in Hawaii or I think the other one was we're in

02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:37.680
Mexico and like they didn't leave the one little resort they were at it was stupid so anyway act

02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:43.000
Efton chat says Kai's you know that's what I'm saying let jackpot lick jackbox make it okay

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:48.440
Judah says we play games online and the mole has to fuck the team up there you go jackbox I know

02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:55.520
some of y'all are out there figure out how to get the license to the mole and do it that'd be

02:09:55.520 --> 02:10:01.640
awesome interview them when they come on the show and ask them about them all right anyway

02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:07.520
uh let's move on that we got more stories to get into I guess I filled up this week's mailbag

02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:12.120
segment with discussion on the mole so this is what happens if you don't email us in a future

02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:19.200
week I I have the right to go on reality TV tangent for 20 minutes all right let's get into

02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:24.480
some more news we actually did a couple stories and I think we're up to Jamie and your last story

02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:35.320
here before calls well Sega made one significant sale over the last week in quarter 1 2018 a Sega

02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:46.520
Game Gear title sold for retail as in it touched a retail POS yes and the game was Sonic the hedgehog

02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:56.520
2 for Sega Game Gear not aftermarket not eBay not used it sold for fucking retail just like it was

02:10:56.520 --> 02:11:04.640
1992 so who had Game Gear games on their shelf in 1992 I don't know but they want to find it

02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:13.800
basically the it came from an NPD group analyst named Matt Piscatella who said that the report

02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:19.240
came in and now they want to know who the fuck it was Kmart I'm telling you it came from a Kmart

02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:27.520
it had to be the tweet no it's two tweets someone in the US market bought a brand new copy of Sonic

02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:33.080
2 for Game Gear at retail in March 2018 I want to know who this person is where they bought it

02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:38.600
and how it all happened like was it just buried in some back room for the last 20 years did it get

02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:44.440
lost underneath some retail fixture was it the 20 year old pre-order what was the reaction when

02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:51.560
the person who bought it saw it so many questions I have it's totally one of those things like you

02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:55.440
know where they do have that stuff hidden away when they just find it in their back room or

02:11:55.440 --> 02:12:00.680
something because I've seen like lots of different posts that usually is like a Walmart's like you

02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:05.080
know they where they kind of go searching for old things and like they'll have you know 56 K

02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:11.360
modems or you know ridiculous it's a Kmart and are there any that have a diner still check those

02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:17.440
first no one of the theories is that it's a Toys R Us self I guess that it could be old stock

02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:23.000
leftover during the liquidation so somebody like like what's behind this door at the Toys R Us oh

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:30.400
we don't go back there okay open it what's in there and that's my guy the the timing matches

02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:35.760
up and the age of it matches up like but wouldn't it when did the Toys R Us liquidation start

02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:40.480
because this is first couple weeks ago it was in March it was in March and this is a March sale

02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:46.000
Toys R Us in a few weeks then again no other deals let me see when the announcement for the Toys R

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.860
Us liquidation so go into something else and I'll research act Defton chat says can we have a

02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:55.440
reality show for those types of things finding old stuff in retail stores it's called unsolved

02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:02.560
mysteries that's the theme I should have played that was March 21st is when they announced the

02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:09.600
start date according to fortune but I'm trying to get the exact day that it began see that's my

02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:13.200
thing is I don't think the people are saying Toys R Us is the easy answer here but I don't

02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:19.080
think Toys R Us things started until earlier this month I mean the other thing is like if have they

02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:24.760
put out the April numbers yet because if it's a big chain and they started really late into March

02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:30.840
maybe they'll find more reports in April maybe the only it doesn't have the date on it just says

02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:36.640
that it was going into effect after the 21st of March so it could be a theory I I would still

02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:41.880
bet money it's a Kmart I mean are there any Kmarts that are having problems like that in

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:49.720
closing like all over at they all Oh Sears I wonder if it's a Sears inventory I know Sears

02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:54.880
got out of the game business a long time ago but Sears are liquidating to aren't they some of them

02:13:54.880 --> 02:14:00.160
Sears was in the game business back when this game was out I mean I maybe grandma found it at Sears

02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:05.440
so the other thing is like if it were like a big chain or something I feel like we would see more

02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:10.200
than just one sale like the fact that it's only one feels weird well they would have destroyed

02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:15.160
them or returned them like a long time ago or clean the clean anything like one branch like if

02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:22.000
it's like that it would just be like just write it off it's so old anything else on this Jamie

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.720
all right it's a collector's item now all right let's move on a couple more stories for you guys

02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:31.760
and then we're gonna open up the skype line at orange lounge radio on skype okay hopefully this

02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:38.240
will be end of some of this loot box stuff but Belgium has ruled that loot boxes in certain games

02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:44.760
are illegal so loot boxes as seen in like FIFA 18 Overwatch counter-strike global offensive are now

02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:53.600
illegal in Belgium and if you are company is still having those loot boxes in your games you can be

02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:59.880
subject to criminal punishment including fines up to 800,000 euros which is just under 1 million

02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:05.480
dollars I'm pretty sure I am prison sentences so I'm pretty sure if it weren't for the prison

02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:10.560
sentences they probably just take the fine and say fuck it but now they'll have to somehow remove

02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:17.000
these I would assume or stop selling their game in Belgium and you know they said the Belgium

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:22.960
Commission has not contacted us or shared its report and that's from EA we strongly believe

02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:27.880
that our games are developed and implemented ethically and lawfully around the world and we

02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:42.280
take these responsibilities very seriously sure EA I totally believe that yeah so I guess they're

02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:48.120
gonna start a dialogue but I mean it's kind of ironic though that EA would be making a comment

02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:52.920
about this being that you know the fact that they fucked with Star Wars kind of started this whole

02:15:53.160 --> 02:16:01.320
avalanche in the first place hmm all right by the way dark to see is shared this in chat apparently

02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:07.720
the sale for Sonic 2 happened in Wisconsin they know that it was a retail location in Wisconsin

02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:12.260
I'm telling you it's a Kmart in Wisconsin fascinating yeah we should interview Trixie Mattel

02:16:12.260 --> 02:16:19.400
and get her local expert feedback on this matter maybe maybe anyway so back to the loot boxes so

02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:22.720
what's gonna happen it they just gonna pull overwatch out of Belgium so that they don't go

02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:27.160
to jail I don't know or patch it out or something I would I would I would well they'll probably still

02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:31.480
continue to have overwatch but they're just you just get the basic skins you don't get any of the

02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:37.040
extra stuff which would suck because the holiday events aren't gonna be very special yeah I don't

02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:40.360
know I'd be very curious to see how companies like Blizzard and stuff are gonna respond is or

02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:45.040
maybe they'll just stop selling the games there I mean it's not like people that want to get the

02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:49.520
game aren't feel gonna be able to go somewhere else yeah especially in a company like Belgium

02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:56.240
or in a country like Belgium all right anyhow one more story for you guys it's also something

02:16:56.240 --> 02:17:00.160
that's gonna impact Blizzard it's something that they had talked about a long time ago in fact I

02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:05.600
think way back when this game was first announced 2009 Blizzard said that Starcraft 2 would have a

02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:12.400
map marketplace with the options to buy and sell custom maps well now that it's 2018 nine years

02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:19.960
later it's finally gonna be a reality so the Starcraft arcade which allows you to create and

02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:27.040
play custom maps will add a premium fan-made map alongside the next big patch which is version 4.3

02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:33.280
they say it's very similar to the creation club by Bethesda Blizzard will handpick specific prominent

02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:37.720
community creators and work with them to create new maps and modes and the share of the sales will

02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:42.080
go directly to the creators and of course some of it to Blizzard as well for the promotion Blizzard

02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:49.080
has been applying their help to the first batch of premium maps which include arc star from creator

02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:54.640
pirate and direct strike from Taya I almost said Tyra but that would be a whole different

02:17:54.640 --> 02:18:02.160
conversation let's not go there anyhow both these maps will cost $4.99 direct strike will actually

02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:07.960
have a free and a premium version premium is going to include four new modes and special cosmetics we

02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:13.360
don't know the patch for Starcraft 2's 4.3 patch we don't the date for it yet but hopefully it's

02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:20.200
going to be soon and not like next year so there you go that feature now finally coming to Starcraft

02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:24.640
2 it feels like it's too late for me but at the same time there's still lots of people playing

02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:29.480
Starcraft and loving Starcraft and the arcade mode was like one of the best things about Starcraft 2

02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:34.600
so it's interesting that's still going all this years in fact Starcraft 2 went free to play at

02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:38.760
some point right that was a big thing last year so I mean you can check out the arcade apparently

02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:43.920
for free so but then of course you can you know buy this stuff if you want as to 100 Matt says

02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:48.640
they will just make skins tags and so forth level based they will just gain those whenever they

02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:53.120
level up it will be random like the loot boxes but still encourage the player to keep playing

02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:59.640
that could be a loophole maybe maybe so as Joe 100 Matt thinks maybe they just won't have you

02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:03.280
able to buy the loot boxes anymore they'll just cut out that feature and that you'll still have

02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:07.360
the loot boxes through the natural progression but then how's Blizzard gonna make their money

02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:12.800
post I mean they could also if they wanted to just patch in a shop and you could just buy the

02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:18.240
currency and buy whatever and then people be like what the fuck yeah then people will be pissed

02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:22.320
because Belgium has it and they don't you know I want to buy individual skin yeah so me I think

02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:25.840
it might probably is in blizzards best interest to either just pull out of Belgium all together

02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:32.760
or follow what sg100 Matt is suggesting so I mean you may have heard like different games have been

02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:36.480
like banned in like Germany and stuff so wouldn't be the first time that they haven't sold the game

02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:41.280
in a certain region like that absolutely all right it's time to open up the Skype line you guys if you

sales because license is you know expiring I doubt they want to renew the licenses right but the

02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:13.640
thing is if you already have the game and the music Senate no I don't see why you should lose

02:21:13.640 --> 02:21:21.240
access to the music I mean well you know as long as you don't put your game online but no it's a

02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:28.400
good point like why should you lose access if you already own the game because you know you already

02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:31.960
pretty much paid for it and they got the money and that all went towards the licensing a long

02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:36.400
time ago so it is a little weird because you know the way video games used to be you didn't always

02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:42.480
used to patch games so it is a little a little weird I don't know if the online element is part

02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:48.560
of the problem is still online but I don't think it's that at all I think it's more of just their

02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:52.720
current they're still selling it which is why it's an issue and they can't really just patch

02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:57.200
it out it's not like it's not like games used to be where it's like oh we lost our light rights

02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:01.000
to the music so we're gonna have different music and all the copies we sell going forward they're

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:10.920
still selling digitally yeah no no granted this may not be the best analogy but I kind of like

02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:20.280
in this to a certain extent to the whole other OS debacle you know from a few years ago where

02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:25.800
they removed it on PlayStation 3 I remember that yeah I made a lot of people upset yeah I mean you

02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:33.520
know granted you know the other OS is an actual feature feature you know on the PlayStation 3

02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:43.240
you know whereas the music is just a mere element within a game but still I mean no no like you

02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:51.880
guys were saying you know you but you bought the game as it was no music and all and you know I

02:22:51.880 --> 02:22:58.440
feel that if you they suddenly take this away you know it's not like they're gonna compensate you

02:22:58.440 --> 02:23:05.280
or anything because they let me get some comments from chat Rama and chat says you don't own the

02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:09.680
game you own the license to play the game and yeah I know that's always like that little like

02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:15.040
the footnote or whatever they get you on but at the same time it's like okay if I were to put in

02:23:15.040 --> 02:23:20.520
DDR max for the PlayStation 2 or something into my PlayStation 2 I wouldn't want to suddenly find

02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:24.280
out that like oh half the songs I can't play anymore because the license expired you know

02:23:24.280 --> 02:23:28.880
like I should be able to continue to play those games basically and I've not heard of this

02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:34.880
happening with especially well I should say non connected music based games yeah connected music

02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:39.160
based games I have heard of this this happens all the time in DDR arcade sure like they'll just say

02:23:39.160 --> 02:23:44.120
okay well time's up on the license but it's gonna go away now but it's also usually a new mix you

02:23:44.120 --> 02:23:49.040
know something else is coming out no I mean it's with EMUs with with the EMUs being mandatory now

02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:54.920
like ace has had this happen 2013 2014 like all of the newer ones they're just like yeah time's

02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:59.760
up it's not in anymore it must be something in the way they license music and now right maybe

02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:04.600
maybe the the takeoff of games like rock band and stuff or to thank for stuff like this I don't know

02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:10.000
I think it's just the way IP works in the music industry and the way licensing works is just

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:16.560
really complicated and it's all in the specifics of the contract in reality if you don't plug your

02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:21.600
game in online you're never gonna get the patch the patches it out and honestly how long is Grand

02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:28.280
Theft Auto 4 been out I can't exactly see that they are probably like releasing new content for

02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:32.000
these games right because Grand Theft Auto 5 already happened so like there's not gonna be

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:35.640
you're not gonna miss anything content wise now Grand Theft Auto 4 though still has multiplayer

02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:39.360
and that's probably gonna be the slippery slope if you want to continue to play multiplayer online

02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:45.060
you're gonna have to patch the game but if that's of no interest to you then don't patch it and you

02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:52.940
will get to keep all your music easy all right well you know before I let you go because I

02:24:52.940 --> 02:24:59.060
reimagine that either act after someone else who would want to call in sure what I do got a tip

02:24:59.060 --> 02:25:08.140
if it news for you regarding my computer situation I'll make a very long story short it looks like I

02:25:08.140 --> 02:25:18.100
could be having a video card on the way possibly by Wednesday a friend of mine from high school I

02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:22.840
don't want a name drop because I don't have his permission to but this is so you can play Magic

02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:30.620
the Gathering 2018 right well there is no 2018 the most recent one is Magic duels but there's

02:25:30.620 --> 02:25:44.060
gonna be shipping me his old you know you know GTX 970 so he says he's gonna put a ship in Monday

02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:49.820
and I'll probably get one say so you'll be able to do a lot with that so hey hand-me-downs they're

02:25:49.820 --> 02:25:54.660
awesome they work oh oh yeah a 970 would be an upgrade on this computer that's for sure but

02:25:54.660 --> 02:25:58.500
that's that's for another time all right anyway Ray Jeter I'm gonna let you go thank you so much

02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:03.620
have a good one yep you too take care all right bye orange on radio all one word on Skype if you

02:26:03.620 --> 02:26:09.540
want to get through and give us a call let's see SSG 100 Matt says there's a person on Twitter with

02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:13.780
this whole game gear thing claiming to know the person who bought the game they bought it from a

02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:21.060
half-price books in Wisconsin a chain of stores there I can't have price but I can't believe I've

02:26:21.060 --> 02:26:26.820
never bought any video games at a half price we've got one in Roosevelt isn't it a use I just can't

02:26:26.820 --> 02:26:31.700
they do get some new content in I just can't believe this is like the fucking like like

02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:36.700
mystery of the century going on here it's just blows my fucking mind all right anyway I think

02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:40.680
we have another call coming in so let's get to it if Skype will cooperate with me higher on orange

02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:45.380
launch radio who's this hey what's going on everyone it's Ron hey Rama what's up buddy not

02:26:45.380 --> 02:26:51.740
much I am running at full cylinders right now so I got you guys on the speakers I'm currently in the

02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:57.420
chat I got Lightroom going editing photos I got my heater going because even for 56 degrees in

02:26:57.420 --> 02:27:02.180
New York it's still cold in my little subterranean apartment and I'm going through stuff getting

02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:08.020
ready for this week's podcast I love it love it were you at a convention this weekend no I did

02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:13.900
something that was I thought was a lot better the convention is this weekend this weekend was

02:27:13.900 --> 02:27:20.860
normally or say last weekend whatever it's our Sakura Matsuri but right it costs like 40 bucks

02:27:20.860 --> 02:27:27.980
to get in we charge you guys yes most Sakura Matsuri events they charge you to get in oh I'm

02:27:27.980 --> 02:27:36.300
you're on the wrong not not in California these coast ones they charge because what started out

02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:42.540
as a normal event has become an over glorified convention I mean you pay 40 bucks to go into

02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:49.300
the Botanical Gardens you've got panels on j-pop j-rock cosplay Lolita okay so this they're doing

02:27:49.380 --> 02:27:54.140
a convention like a mini convention out of it what's up there's any cosplay yeah there's there's

02:27:54.140 --> 02:27:57.900
a Sakura Matsuri here and you get to walk in a parade and be afraid there's a lot of free stuff

02:27:57.900 --> 02:28:02.540
here but to be fair they do like concerts and things around the same time cuz didn't you and

02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:08.100
um your your pal go to the taiko drum thing and that we didn't know that one though that money

02:28:08.100 --> 02:28:13.500
goes back into the Taiko group special thing the Northern California cherry blossom festival which

02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:19.580
was in San Francisco the past two weeks does concerts also yeah so and those are free they

02:28:19.580 --> 02:28:24.240
have here they're arguing and some pay things but they're the type of thing you you expect to pay

02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:29.420
money to go to God likes like the food vendors and whatnot yeah that's right anyway sorry no

02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:36.740
problem I mean yeah that's basically what it's become so instead of doing that I went to it a

02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:43.260
ramen street festival and dropped $40 there and the food was so good good times that sounds good

02:28:43.260 --> 02:28:52.780
what'd you get um I had fish ramen I had ultimate um and to ultimate ramen um taste one was called

02:28:52.780 --> 02:28:58.100
championship ramen and I forget the name of the other one but I did post it on my Facebook but

02:28:58.100 --> 02:29:07.140
one thing that did happen will make um Jamie squee like nobody else's business more or less please go

02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:14.020
for it elaborate so I James you know I have a ronma what have hard battle t-shirt that I wear yes

02:29:14.020 --> 02:29:19.900
so I'm walking around you know filming you know doing a Facebook live with me walking up and down

02:29:19.900 --> 02:29:26.100
the block and then I see some and I noticed a lot of Japanese workers who came from Japan for this

02:29:26.100 --> 02:29:31.740
notice the shirt and pointed out I was at one booth and I found myself getting excited because

02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:36.940
a lot of people there knew the shirt knew the characters I always started singing the opening

02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:43.020
right there spot that's cute that's awesome yeah I have to quickly say though on ramen since you

02:29:43.020 --> 02:29:47.660
brought up food my favorite to order when I go to the restaurant is a curry ramen that's always my

02:29:47.660 --> 02:29:55.740
favorite always black garlic tonkatsu for me but what's interesting so this near where I work here

02:29:55.740 --> 02:30:01.100
in Sacramento there's been this Chinese restaurant that's been there for years like he's at least 10

02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:06.380
years probably 15 years it closed kind of out of nowhere and I'm a little sad about it but at the

02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:11.260
same time a ramen joint is replacing it so I'm kind of like well okay that happened to the pokey

02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:17.500
place near my house I kind of think pokies overrated I don't know it's nice to have something

02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:22.580
that I that I can eat yeah no no I understand but pokies becoming like frozen yogurt like there's

02:30:22.580 --> 02:30:28.220
just too many places it's super trendy it yeah it's replacing I'm not saying we should like eliminate

02:30:28.220 --> 02:30:33.340
all the poke in the world but it's you know we got to scale it back although speaking of frozen

02:30:33.340 --> 02:30:37.100
yogurt places you may not have heard this new star sorry to hijack your call Rama but this

02:30:37.100 --> 02:30:42.860
happens cool uh dark soccer I don't know if you heard about this yogurt land the place that had

02:30:42.860 --> 02:30:49.100
the Nintendo tie-ins here the one here locally gone it closed that sucks I know it fucking sucks

02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:54.580
you still have pink bury which you know is the good old OLR standby but we have a new one we

02:30:54.580 --> 02:30:58.820
relate to like to go to call Menchie's which I think I think they have those oh I think I saw

02:30:58.820 --> 02:31:02.620
Menchie's when I was traveling so I think they're all over wait wait wait wait wait hold up hold up

02:31:02.620 --> 02:31:08.900
did you say yogurt land yeah yeah it's a chain we had one out here in lower Manhattan that's been

02:31:08.900 --> 02:31:12.580
closed for over a year and I never got you has to check it out because they put a sign saying

02:31:12.580 --> 02:31:19.380
they're renovating next thing you know it's gone yeah I mean we we have a pink berry we have 16

02:31:19.380 --> 02:31:24.940
handles far as I know the closest Menchie is somewhere out on Long Island but you know yeah

02:31:24.940 --> 02:31:29.300
that's I just I like the crazy flavors I don't know I got to admit pink berry I'm not as big

02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:34.180
on it as I used to be because I think a lot of the flavors like every time they get a flavor I

02:31:34.180 --> 02:31:39.660
really like it never comes back and so I'm I kind of get annoyed by that I don't like how the pink

02:31:39.660 --> 02:31:44.820
berry doesn't let you do your own toppings now it's like the the killer for me yeah they have

02:31:44.820 --> 02:31:50.100
some good stuff but I think I think I kind of kind of drifted more towards that you get to make it

02:31:50.100 --> 02:31:54.780
yourself that's probably Alan's influence Alan never really liked that either Alan was more big

02:31:54.780 --> 02:31:59.300
on the other do-it-yourself let's not eat it pink berry I got sick but I think it was the Nutella

02:31:59.300 --> 02:32:04.260
I've got to say though every time we go to Menchie's I just can't stop thinking of the

02:32:04.260 --> 02:32:12.820
emergency rations in Excel saga all right Rama I have a Menchie hat I know I hijacked your call

02:32:12.820 --> 02:32:16.380
but anything else you want to share with us tonight before we let you go I will cut down

02:32:16.380 --> 02:32:21.740
my topics to two all right number one you talked about my space at the beginning of the show yeah

02:32:21.740 --> 02:32:27.620
there is there is an article that's been floating around about my space about some of the craziness

02:32:27.620 --> 02:32:32.460
one one of them in there they talk about the top eight there's always a fight about the top eight

02:32:32.460 --> 02:32:37.260
and I think this was a BuzzFeed article yeah whenever this floats around that top eight I

02:32:37.260 --> 02:32:41.940
know six of the people on that top eight because I was friends I'm still friends with that person's

02:32:41.940 --> 02:32:48.700
but that was on myspace yeah I don't even remember who is in my top eight I really don't I feel like

02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:53.540
olr started around that time so I probably had Janie in the top eight probably Loki if he was

02:32:53.540 --> 02:33:01.020
even on myspace on you remember I had my music stuff on there oh you sure did I know I had you

02:33:01.020 --> 02:33:09.880
and she who shall not be named uh-huh um yeah yeah I don't I don't even remember anymore so I I have

02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:13.260
no idea who is in my top eight I wasn't dating Alan then so he wouldn't have been in the top

02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:18.220
eight maybe whoever I was taking at the time it was a long time ago but yeah I can't even remember

02:33:18.380 --> 02:33:22.300
it would be fun to go back and see though because yeah who knows if I'm even still friends with those

02:33:22.300 --> 02:33:28.100
people as sad as it is I think I deleted mine oh yeah I did too so I wouldn't be able to know well

02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:33.100
then at some point you were able to expand it to like a top 24 so that's what I did yeah just used

02:33:33.100 --> 02:33:37.580
to be able to write code inject code in here to make it like your top 100 you know what I think

02:33:37.580 --> 02:33:43.700
I did I think I made my top eight so that it wasn't so competitive I think I made my top eight like

02:33:43.700 --> 02:33:50.700
Abba and Alanis Morissette and it was like all the like bands and stuff so I I didn't have to

02:33:50.700 --> 02:33:55.940
play that ugly rank your friends game Rob forget forget the rest of the topics I want to talk about

02:33:55.940 --> 02:34:04.500
tonight what's on Abba coming back we haven't I opened up that door didn't I stay tuned to this

02:34:04.500 --> 02:34:10.220
week shaking and crying and yes there will be a new episode this week but I Lord Jesus I don't

02:34:10.300 --> 02:34:14.340
want to ruin it but all I will say is that the title is appropriate didn't you just have a

02:34:14.340 --> 02:34:22.980
musical episode yes yes that's that's all I can say Rama I'm sorry that's cool cuz my first one

02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:27.800
article I was like oh my god I have to tell her I gotta tell you were the first to put it on my

02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:31.860
page for what it's worth when I roll that a baby probably you had the East Coast advantage here

02:34:31.860 --> 02:34:36.140
because when I rolled out of bed it was like Rama shared an article with you and if you were the

02:34:36.140 --> 02:34:41.420
first to post it and then like it I kid you not that article got posted to my Facebook page at

02:34:41.420 --> 02:34:47.300
least five times and one of them was Jamie which but but like I think I responded to Jamie's I'm

02:34:47.300 --> 02:34:52.820
like yeah I woke up saw it yeah no which which again I put I love that I'm getting tied to this

02:34:52.820 --> 02:34:58.300
all the time but I'm not being sarcastic like I'm actually really touched that people when they

02:34:58.300 --> 02:35:03.140
think of such a great fucking band like Abba think of me and like want to tell me and share

02:35:03.140 --> 02:35:09.100
that news so I'm I'm post it five more times to my wall I love it I almost texted it to you that

you said that my friend Derek who was our Matt and Marissa sorry Rob I thought I had you in my

02:36:14.500 --> 02:36:19.700
top I deleted my myspace that's right so I may have been in your top eight and I got bounced

02:36:19.700 --> 02:36:24.420
out when I deleted it I do have a last-minute story all right go for it so the switch has

02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:35.940
been hacked finally oh so it's been hacked in the craziest part about this hack it's unpatchable so

02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:42.420
the way it's involves a flaw in the switches Tegra processor their USB recovery mode which

02:36:42.420 --> 02:36:48.380
can't be patched it just cannot be patched anymore so already two hacking groups have allowed users

02:36:48.420 --> 02:36:55.700
to jailbreak the switch and even run a ported version of Linux on the system and to actually

02:36:55.700 --> 02:37:00.580
access it I mean it's like super easy basically create like a little dongle thing that hooks up

02:37:00.580 --> 02:37:05.340
to the side of it and you can do it actually with a paperclip if you have it formatted just right

02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:12.820
but it's just so crazy that already we've this has happened and it's unpatchable so it'll be

02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:20.220
interesting to see what happens from here interesting especially to see whatever they

02:37:20.220 --> 02:37:25.020
announced next oh my god Jamie is this your own myspace picture that you just linked in chat yep

02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:29.820
and also I linked another one of you and me on Space Mountain oh Jesus was my old crappy phone

02:37:29.820 --> 02:37:35.700

02:37:35.700 --> 02:37:39.300

would you like to say well they that a mining data mining mines sorry that the bill and basically

02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:56.780
they found more DLC characters that are coming to the game and it's pretty exciting okay what

02:38:56.780 --> 02:39:06.180
kind of characters probably two other waves that the first one would be Adeline from Kirby 64 mm-hmm

02:39:06.180 --> 02:39:18.140
also I forgot the name Oh row road Roach the Roach sorry that Roach from Kirby's quick squat and

02:39:18.140 --> 02:39:28.460
also Dark Meta Knight too and there's also a third DLC probably with with the gem Bastion

02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:38.700
the sisters or mages from Kirby Star Allies okay there's also one other Megalor from Kirby return

02:39:38.700 --> 02:39:46.540
to dreamland and another character which I forgot god damn ah Susie from Kirby planet robot so and

02:39:46.540 --> 02:39:51.500
also Terenza from Kirby triple deluxe so look forward to all those amiibo coming soon as well

02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:59.980
yes dark soccer is actually wearing a Kirby shirt tonight and earlier in the show I know you weren't

02:39:59.980 --> 02:40:03.220
here for the first 30 minutes but be sure to go back and listen to it because I thought dark

02:40:03.220 --> 02:40:08.340
soccer was telling me about a Kirby drag outfit she was planning but it turns out she said a Kirby

02:40:08.340 --> 02:40:13.580
and I was like oh act F's gonna be so disappointed I thought it was a Kirby drag outfit you know I

02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:18.940
could probably put something together I'm pretty handy with some hot glue yes I know I know I'll do

02:40:18.940 --> 02:40:23.020
a Meta Knight one well that'd be fun so you're enjoying the Kirby of course you're enjoying the

02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:31.420
Kirby switch game of course I already finished it so I I'm pretty excited about the new content and

02:40:31.420 --> 02:40:39.180
having more characters though I do wish the game had a little more expansion to it mm-hmm since it's

02:40:39.380 --> 02:40:48.180
it is kind of short and all that stuff but the game is if if anybody is still considering getting

02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:55.020
it I really recommend it especially playing with friends yeah that game is so much fun with friends

02:40:55.020 --> 02:41:00.420
so way too much fun how about that another party game that Nintendo has done successfully yeah

02:41:00.420 --> 02:41:05.740
that's not a read that's a real like they just always seem to do that I finished the game when

02:41:05.740 --> 02:41:09.580
I had a bunch of friends over and it was it was a lot of fun but it also made it a lot easier

02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:17.080
because you can use the special characters and they're super overpowered like the the one guy

02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:22.140
from Kirby superstar like lets you rain down bomb confetti or something and it just decimated

02:41:22.140 --> 02:41:27.740
everything it was great yeah marks Marcus is overpowered also gooey it's like really fun to

02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:33.220
use yeah all right well act after I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up but thank you for the

02:41:33.220 --> 02:41:40.020

02:42:46.780 --> 02:42:53.220
donuts yay donuts donuts are a thing to get excited about you know we didn't mention this

02:42:53.220 --> 02:42:59.100
on air but last night we went to that place they do the big puffs here so you actually get like

02:42:59.100 --> 02:43:02.700
you can get a glazed or a non glazed donut I was like a glazed donut that's too much I got a non

02:43:02.700 --> 02:43:07.780
glazed donut they put ice cream in it so I got cake batter ice cream in a donut and then they

02:43:07.780 --> 02:43:11.580
like they like fry it they fuse it together or something they roll it around in toppings and

02:43:11.580 --> 02:43:16.260
then fuse it together they let you do your choice of like frozen yogurt style toppings like coconut

02:43:16.260 --> 02:43:23.820
and sprinkles and candy bits I got sprinkles and coconut cream used to have cronuts for their ice

02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:29.060
cream sandwiches interesting it was pretty epic I think they put them in a panini press yeah I

02:43:29.060 --> 02:43:33.140
think they put them in a panini press and kind of like reunify the donut but it works it works

02:43:33.140 --> 02:43:39.660
really well anyway that's what my big butt ate this week anyway uh let's see so let's go around

02:43:39.660 --> 02:43:43.700
to your rails this final thought here I'll start with you dark Sakura what is your final thought

02:43:43.700 --> 02:43:50.100
for our listeners tonight I want a donut oh sorry to bring it up uh let's see my final thought

02:43:50.100 --> 02:43:57.980
tonight is I I'm still full from brunch man that's the downside of the great tradition of gay Sunday

02:43:57.980 --> 02:44:03.540
brunch is that I'm still full actually if I may bring this up all right faces is now doing a

02:44:03.540 --> 02:44:08.900
charity brunch on Sundays oh I didn't know that that's fine so I'm planning on going next Sunday

02:44:08.900 --> 02:44:15.820
if people want to go mmm if I'm here yeah cool all right last but not least Loki your final thought

02:44:15.820 --> 02:44:21.620
tonight my final thought is I have to figure out whether there's switch games to get I'm looking

02:44:21.620 --> 02:44:25.740
for more local multiplayer stuff because my son's having some friends over and they need more

02:44:25.740 --> 02:44:29.420
four-player yeah you have to look into the online stuff the big library of indie games there's got

02:44:29.420 --> 02:44:33.940
to be some good stuff in there yeah jackbox and I'm just kidding they're too young for that but

02:44:33.940 --> 02:44:36.980
yeah they wouldn't you probably don't want the kids playing trivia murder party it's probably

02:44:36.980 --> 02:44:42.780
a little soon for that yeah yeah probably all right anyway Oh Loki suggests Kirby star allies

02:44:42.780 --> 02:44:49.460
there you go well that is a cute cute kid game and yeah you know he wants Mario Party but I

02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:54.020
don't think there's any Mario Party games tonight yet oh yeah I would say that's a guarantee for e3

02:44:54.020 --> 02:44:59.940
but we'll see we'll see anyway we'll find out as we get closer and closer to e3 next week here

02:44:59.940 --> 02:45:04.420
