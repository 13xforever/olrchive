00:00.000 --> 00:17.440
This week, Sony made waves by announcing its retreat from events, but speculation is

00:17.440 --> 00:19.760
that they're saving money, time, and effort in a quieter year.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.360
They'll be back, it's only inevitable.

00:21.360 --> 00:24.200
That's just one story to catch up on, join us for plenty more news from around the gaming

00:24.200 --> 00:29.960
universe starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:29.960 --> 00:35.520
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:35.520 --> 00:36.800
every gamer has a voice.

00:36.800 --> 00:44.040
It's Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight, episode number 753 for this November the 25th of 2018.

00:44.040 --> 00:47.360
My name, Rob Roberts, and his name, Techmaster Loki.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.360
Hello.

00:48.360 --> 00:49.360
Hi, how are you?

00:49.360 --> 00:50.360
I'm fine.

00:50.360 --> 00:51.360
We are back after a week off.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.840
We weren't here last week, and that was my bad.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.480
I'll get to that in a minute.

00:54.480 --> 00:57.640
Not joining us in studio tonight, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.120
She is still on work leave.

00:59.120 --> 01:02.480
Unfortunately for a little while longer, but she'll be joining us live in studio December

01:02.480 --> 01:06.960
9th, I think is the day she'll be here, which may be on the current trajectory I'm planning.

01:06.960 --> 01:10.040
I think December 9th is going to be our last shoutcast show.

01:10.040 --> 01:14.600
If you haven't already heard the news, our live show is going to move over to Twitch.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.260
Nothing will change with the podcast.

01:16.260 --> 01:17.960
It will still be a podcast feed as it always was.

01:17.960 --> 01:22.180
In fact, I was reminded while we were doing our call with Bobby tonight earlier, we've

01:22.180 --> 01:23.240
kind of done this before.

01:23.240 --> 01:27.320
We used to be on Justin TV back in the day, and apparently somebody in our chat room over

01:27.320 --> 01:30.500
at live.vognetwork.com dug up some old highlights.

01:30.500 --> 01:35.420
So if you want to see like 2008 video clips of OLR, our old Twitch TV channel, Orange

01:35.420 --> 01:36.420
Lounge Radio.

01:36.420 --> 01:37.420
We didn't have a camera though.

01:37.420 --> 01:38.420
No, we did.

01:38.420 --> 01:39.420
Did we?

01:39.420 --> 01:40.420
Oh yeah.

01:40.420 --> 01:41.420
You forgot.

01:41.420 --> 01:42.420
Yeah.

01:42.420 --> 01:45.800
Remember the house I used to live at with John, with the lights, the Christmas lights

01:45.800 --> 01:47.800
in the garage?

01:47.800 --> 01:48.800
That was on video.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.640
Remember you played the Final Fantasy 13 demo?

01:50.640 --> 01:53.720
Yeah, but I thought we had that, just that was the video.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.260
No, there was both.

01:55.260 --> 01:58.660
Because remember I had that camera, that blue tiny little camera?

01:58.660 --> 01:59.660
Yeah.

01:59.660 --> 02:00.660
That thing broke by the way.

02:00.660 --> 02:01.660
That's long gone.

02:01.660 --> 02:04.520
That's when I was doing those vlogs on YouTube for a little while.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.280
That's another project that's long gone.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.340
So anyway, yeah.

02:07.340 --> 02:08.500
So it's funny.

02:08.500 --> 02:13.340
What's old is new again, but we're going back to the Twitch thing in a few weeks.

02:13.340 --> 02:16.600
So we're targeting December 16th, but don't hold us to that.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.300
But anyway, yeah.

02:18.300 --> 02:22.000
So we're here in studio now doing the podcast the way we always have.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.160
And by the way, I do want to emphasize, it's still going to be Orange Lounge Radio even

02:26.160 --> 02:27.160
after we move.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.920
It's just going to be, yes, there will be some, you'll get to see us doing a radio show,

02:30.920 --> 02:31.920
but it is still a radio show.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.600
So I don't want our people that listen to us on their commutes.

02:34.600 --> 02:39.240
And I know we have data entry during the day, people and other tech jobs where they just

02:39.240 --> 02:43.440
listen to us in the earbuds while they play, or while they play, while they work, maybe

02:43.440 --> 02:45.120
play, and do that.

02:45.120 --> 02:50.300
And I just, for you guys, it's not going to change, but it is kind of a big change for

02:50.300 --> 02:52.020
us and an exciting one as well.

02:52.020 --> 02:57.300
But honestly, I've joked time and time again, this computer that we do the show on is still

02:57.300 --> 02:59.220
running Windows XP.

02:59.220 --> 03:05.380
So this technology is circa like 2006, 2007, and it's just, it's time to modernize a little

03:05.380 --> 03:06.380
bit.

03:06.380 --> 03:08.980
So it's going to be really exciting and hopefully get us some new folks here at Orange Lounge

03:08.980 --> 03:09.980
Radio.

03:09.980 --> 03:10.980
Really excited.

03:10.980 --> 03:12.220
So let's talk about video games.

03:12.220 --> 03:15.160
We are going to get it in the news in just a little bit.

03:15.160 --> 03:18.420
And we are going to cover, because it was the Thanksgiving holiday in the States this

03:18.420 --> 03:22.540
week, which I hope you all had an awesome Thanksgiving and all that good stuff.

03:22.540 --> 03:25.540
Those of you in the States anyway, if you're in other countries, you probably was just

03:25.540 --> 03:29.160
another week for you, but I hope you had a good week nonetheless.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.740
But since it was the Thanksgiving holiday in the States, there probably wasn't as much

03:32.740 --> 03:33.740
gaming news this week.

03:33.740 --> 03:34.740
There was a little bit.

03:34.740 --> 03:35.740
We'll get into that.

03:35.740 --> 03:38.820
But we're going to kind of combine the week we missed last week and touch on some of the

03:38.820 --> 03:43.120
big headlines from last week, because there's, Loki, there's some big stuff that happened

03:43.120 --> 03:45.400
last week that we've got to give our insight on.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.480
Like this whole E3 change.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.480
We'll get to that later.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.480
Yeah.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.480
Yeah.

03:51.480 --> 03:52.480
That's interesting.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.480
Anyway.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.560
But to start off the show tonight, let me tell you about why I wasn't here last week.

03:55.560 --> 04:01.760
So I was in Las Vegas and I was attending Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival in Las Vegas,

04:01.760 --> 04:04.880
which was at the Rio Hotel, which is just off the strip.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.080
About 5,000 people going to this event.

04:07.080 --> 04:13.080
I'm guessing that number based off the raffle ticket numbers that ran from zero to 5,000.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.720
That's why I'm assuming there's about 5,000 people.

04:15.720 --> 04:20.120
Maybe you add in some press and things like that too is maybe like 5,500, but about 5,000

04:20.120 --> 04:27.320
people give or take at this convention center at the Rio to celebrate Final Fantasy XIV,

04:27.320 --> 04:31.040
which is of course the online Final Fantasy game.

04:31.040 --> 04:35.240
There is an older online Final Fantasy game, Final Fantasy XI, but that game, they kind

04:35.240 --> 04:38.440
of stopped doing expansions and all that for a little while ago.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.240
They're doing more minor updates with that game.

04:40.240 --> 04:44.200
I think there's a much larger player base on Final Fantasy XIV because it is the newer

04:44.200 --> 04:45.200
one.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.880
It is the game that's on PlayStation 4 as well as PC.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.560
And so this was really to celebrate that game.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.160
And they did do the new expansion.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.240
So I was out there in the audience during the keynote.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.400
If you guys were watching on Twitch, I think there actually was a moment you probably could

04:57.400 --> 04:59.440
have seen me on camera, which would have had to know where to look.

04:59.440 --> 05:03.440
And I don't, I always find my reactions and those crowd shots really weird.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.240
So I usually try to look away anyway.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.120
But I was there when they unveiled the brand new expansion.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.320
Shadowbringers is the new expansion that they're doing for Final Fantasy XIV.

05:11.320 --> 05:16.520
I keep wanting to call it Stormbringers because the current expansion is Stormblood.

05:16.520 --> 05:20.040
And for some reason, it's another SB acronym.

05:20.040 --> 05:24.800
So you have Stormblood is the current expansion and Shadowbringers is the new one.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.120
The first one was Heavensward.

05:26.120 --> 05:29.400
So it was nothing SB, but it's weird that both acronyms are SB.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.400
So I keep wanting to say Stormbringers.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.400
Heavens...

05:31.400 --> 05:32.400
I don't know.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.400
Yeah.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.400
Heavensbringer.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.400
Yeah.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.400
Heavensworb.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.400
So that's the new expansion.

05:37.400 --> 05:43.080
And with that, they announced the Blue Mage job is going to be a part of actually Stormblood.

05:43.080 --> 05:46.160
It's going to be in the next patch, a little bit controversial.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.160
This Blue Mage implementation, because they're not implementing it like a normal job.

05:50.160 --> 05:54.920
They are going to be doing kind of like a special little, I guess, side events that

05:54.920 --> 05:57.900
you do more in a solo manner.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.100
And it's going to be capped at level 50.

06:00.100 --> 06:05.720
And you can do this whole like mass carnival up to, you know, level like 50 events and

06:05.720 --> 06:06.720
things.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.400
You go out in the field and learn spells.

06:08.400 --> 06:12.760
Apparently you can do things in small groups like up to level 50, but what they're trying

06:12.760 --> 06:17.640
to do is they're trying to keep Blue Mage out of current rating and the current meta

06:17.640 --> 06:18.840
and out of progression.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.040
And that's a very controversial change because there's some people out there that were very

06:22.040 --> 06:25.600
much looking forward to Blue Mage and being able to play that in the progression.

06:25.600 --> 06:30.520
So it's kind of like you get this kind of like awkward implementation of the Blue Mage

06:30.520 --> 06:31.520
job.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.480
And so it's rubbing some people the wrong way.

06:34.480 --> 06:39.920
For me, I guess we're lucky it's there at all in a way, but I'll give it a chance.

06:39.920 --> 06:40.920
I'll check it out.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.120
I think I'll change that once the other expansion comes out.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.120
See, and that's the thing.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.120
They could.

06:44.120 --> 06:49.640
Maybe if the Rabble Rabble is really great and, you know, they could always retinker

06:49.640 --> 06:54.740
it to allow Blue Mage to just cap up to level 80, which will be the new level cap, and be

06:54.740 --> 06:57.300
in the progression content and maybe limit the skills.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.560
I think they're really worried about balancing.

06:59.560 --> 07:03.720
And they were really worried about Blue Mages getting rejected from parties because they

07:03.720 --> 07:09.000
don't know all the spells because there's going to be, they said, 49 spells you go out

07:09.000 --> 07:10.360
and absorb from monsters.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.340
That's the whole thing with Blue Mage, by the way, if you weren't familiar in Final

07:12.340 --> 07:18.000
Fantasy lore, like in games like Final Fantasy V, you would learn spells as a Blue Mage by

07:18.000 --> 07:21.720
fighting the monsters and getting it cast on you basically.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.600
And then you may learn the spell and they're kind of implementing it that way in Final

07:25.600 --> 07:26.600
Fantasy XIV.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.140
Except I don't think, I think you just have to fight the mob.

07:29.140 --> 07:32.560
You don't necessarily have to have the spell cast on you, but still, you know, relatively

07:32.560 --> 07:33.560
close.

07:33.600 --> 07:34.600
Interesting implementation.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.640
We'll see where they go with that.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.640
I think it's very interesting.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.240
It is not a part of the expansion.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.580
It's part of this expansion.

07:40.580 --> 07:42.240
So it's something that's leading into the next expansion.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.240
So it's in the new expansion.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.720
Yes, there will be more jobs in the new expansion.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.680
They didn't say what those are.

07:49.680 --> 07:54.460
There's a leak that called this Blue Mage thing and some other things.

07:54.460 --> 07:57.440
So if you want to believe the leak, there's going to be two more jobs.

07:57.440 --> 08:01.340
I'll let you go find that for yourself if you want to go look it up.

08:01.460 --> 08:04.620
The other big thing that they teased, I'm very happy about this.

08:04.620 --> 08:10.020
So in years past at this event, Yoshida, who's the producer and director of XIV, he wears

08:10.020 --> 08:14.060
a t-shirt that will tease something about the expansion.

08:14.060 --> 08:20.220
So a couple of years ago, he wore a Batman t-shirt and at the next Fan Fest, Dark Knight

08:20.220 --> 08:21.220
was a job.

08:21.220 --> 08:22.220
Get it?

08:22.220 --> 08:28.260
So then last time he wore a Scarlet Witch t-shirt and guess what got announced at the

08:28.260 --> 08:29.260
next Fan Fest?

08:29.260 --> 08:30.260
Red Mage, right?

08:30.260 --> 08:31.260
Get it?

08:31.260 --> 08:37.340
So this time he wore a Bugs Bunny shirt and he pointed at it when he was talking about

08:37.340 --> 08:38.740
the new race.

08:38.740 --> 08:43.500
Although he wouldn't say what the new race was, but it's pretty much saying without saying

08:43.500 --> 08:49.860
that the Viera from Final Fantasy XII will pretty much certainly be the new race in Final

08:49.860 --> 08:50.860
Fantasy XIV.

08:50.860 --> 08:54.700
It's just not totally confirmed yet, but what other bunny races are out there and it's,

08:54.700 --> 08:56.540
I mean, I'm super happy.

08:56.540 --> 08:58.900
Like obviously like Fran is one of my all time favorite Final Fantasy characters.

08:58.900 --> 09:02.780
What he means to tell you is Space Jam is coming to you.

09:02.780 --> 09:08.180
I would be okay with that actually if that, you know, Final Fantasy XIV in Space Jam.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.180
Exactly.

09:09.180 --> 09:12.020
It's like, all right, cool.

09:12.020 --> 09:16.060
Now one of the other big things they announced in the keynote was this trust system.

09:16.060 --> 09:20.180
So you're going to be able to, and Final Fantasy XI has this, they implemented it way later

09:20.180 --> 09:23.380
when the game was dying off and it was harder to find parties.

09:23.380 --> 09:28.260
What they did is they made it so that you could have NPCs in your party basically, and

09:28.260 --> 09:30.620
they would function like normal party members.

09:30.620 --> 09:34.740
They're bringing that system to Final Fantasy XIV, but they're not doing it because Final

09:34.740 --> 09:36.060
Fantasy XIV is dying off.

09:36.060 --> 09:38.220
At least they're certainly not going to admit that's the case.

09:38.220 --> 09:40.240
And I don't think the game is.

09:40.240 --> 09:46.780
They're doing it because, this is really interesting, they realize that there are some people that

09:46.780 --> 09:53.780
although they want to play an MMO with friends, the story makes you do like dungeons and group

09:53.780 --> 09:55.940
content to progress in the story.

09:55.940 --> 10:00.140
Some people don't want to do the group content because they feel like if they're not pulling

10:00.140 --> 10:01.980
their weight, they're holding the group back.

10:01.980 --> 10:05.740
And it kind of gives that whole like anxiety of, you know, I'm playing with other people

10:05.740 --> 10:08.320
and they are relying on me and I don't want to fuck up.

10:08.320 --> 10:13.460
So basically they're going to allow you to do, use these trusts to help you get through

10:13.460 --> 10:16.140
the story and do content without other people.

10:16.140 --> 10:20.660
And it's, it's very strange because that was kind of a theme between that and the Bloom

10:20.660 --> 10:21.820
Age experience.

10:21.820 --> 10:26.940
I kind of felt like a theme I was hearing about this expansion was, here is an MMO you

10:26.940 --> 10:29.500
can play all by yourself.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.580
And I thought that was just very interesting.

10:31.580 --> 10:37.220
But I totally recognize, and I've even been in this position before that sometimes you

10:37.220 --> 10:40.480
don't necessarily want to play with other people.

10:40.480 --> 10:45.660
You just want to be in the experience at the same time other people are experiencing it.

10:45.660 --> 10:47.960
So you can talk about that or life or whatever.

10:47.960 --> 10:51.680
It's a chat room with fire spells and great swords.

10:51.680 --> 10:52.800
That's what it is.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.420
That's what the MMO world is to some people.

10:55.420 --> 10:56.780
And that's totally fine.

10:56.780 --> 11:02.240
So I think it's very interesting that you have Final Fantasy XIV kind of embracing the

11:02.240 --> 11:04.400
solo experience in an MMO.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.400
What do you think?

11:05.400 --> 11:08.360
I know you don't play a lot of MMOs currently, Loki, but you spend a lot of time with Final

11:08.360 --> 11:09.800
Fantasy XI and so forth.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.480
I know you've dabbled in a few of them.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.220
What do you think about like the solo experience in MMO?

11:14.220 --> 11:17.240
Like do you think MMOs should be built to play alone?

11:17.240 --> 11:18.240
Sure.

11:18.240 --> 11:21.600
I like playing Final Fantasy XI alone.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.600
Yeah.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.600
Sometimes.

11:23.600 --> 11:29.320
Unless I was up against a roadblock that I needed to have a party, like any sort of experience.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.720
You get the trusts and you don't need that anymore.

11:31.720 --> 11:32.720
Granted.

11:32.720 --> 11:33.720
Interesting.

11:33.720 --> 11:37.080
I didn't really have that problem when I was playing on that not so legit server where

11:37.080 --> 11:42.160
the XP boost was like times 10 and that was awesome because then I could solo all the

11:42.160 --> 11:44.680
way up to whatever I need to.

11:44.680 --> 11:47.680
Let's go to our chat room for some feedback on this because we do tape live every Sunday

11:47.680 --> 11:52.400
night at the voice of geeks network, vognetwork.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night

11:52.400 --> 11:56.000
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.600
And you can join us in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.560
But I do want to start plugging away here when I mention it because, you know, I mentioned

12:02.560 --> 12:05.520
this at the top of every show, but I do want to start mentioning if you aren't already

12:05.520 --> 12:11.040
following the network on Twitch TV, you might want to get over there and get on that vognetwork

12:11.040 --> 12:15.920
over on Twitch TV because that is where we're going to be in the future in about a month

12:15.920 --> 12:17.200
if all things stay on track.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.320
Anyway, some of the comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.440
Dungeon Buster says, this is a nice gesture for 14.

12:23.440 --> 12:26.800
Pugs can either be awesome experiences or toxic nightmares.

12:27.360 --> 12:31.920
It's super nice to drop into a group of nice players, but getting toxic ones can ruin your

12:31.920 --> 12:32.320
night.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.600
And that's exactly right.

12:34.320 --> 12:38.560
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I can still optionally play with friends.

12:38.560 --> 12:42.480
I hated having to be like, hey, Free Company, while you're out there playing Moogle Mog,

12:42.480 --> 12:45.520
can you help me with this four person dungeon way beneath you?

12:45.520 --> 12:49.280
Yeah, like maybe some people, you know, they want to be able to do the old stuff without

12:49.280 --> 12:52.240
having to ask people to run through it with them.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.880
So yeah, it's something that trust is going to open up.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.240
It's gonna be very interesting.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.920
So anyway, you know, I'm sure a lot of the announcements have been online.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.800
I don't want to, I don't want to retread that territory too much.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.920
So what else happened at this event besides the keynote?

13:05.920 --> 13:07.920
Well, they did a variety of panels.

13:07.920 --> 13:12.080
So they did some panels talking about the next patch that's going to include Blue Mage.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.920
They went into detail on Blue Mage.

13:13.920 --> 13:18.640
They did like a PvP tournament there, which I'm not super into PvP and 14.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.920
So it wasn't really something that was up my alley, but I know it is for some people.

13:21.920 --> 13:22.720
So that was cool.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.480
They did a big costume contest.

13:24.480 --> 13:28.480
And let me tell you, the cosplay was like Dragon Con level good.

13:28.480 --> 13:32.720
Like Final Fantasy 14 cosplayers go all out and there was some really good stuff.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.120
So that was really cool to see.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.080
And they do like lore panels and all that stuff as well.

13:38.080 --> 13:41.200
While that's going on, it was interesting because this year they had it split.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.600
They had the very large room was kind of like their panel room.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.120
And they had some events in there.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.520
I can't remember if I posted this on Twitter,

13:47.520 --> 13:51.440
but I took a picture of myself in front of this giant makeshift aetheryte crystal,

13:51.440 --> 13:54.960
which is like a home crystal doing the little pose like I'm tuning to the crystal.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.320
So that is something that they had like in that room.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.360
And they had like some little silly carnival games that you could win,

14:01.360 --> 14:05.200
like posters and stickers and, you know, very silly things for playing.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.480
So that was kind of neat.

14:06.480 --> 14:11.600
But then inside rooms, of course, they had one room that was all about playing Final Fantasy 14.

14:11.600 --> 14:19.040
And you could stand in line to do a new primal fight, Yojimbo as a primal fight,

14:19.040 --> 14:23.040
which Yojimbo is actually already, I mean, Yojimbo is already in Final Fantasy 10.

14:23.040 --> 14:23.840
That's where he comes from.

14:23.840 --> 14:29.200
But Yojimbo is already a dungeon boss, but they redid him for a primal fight.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.440
And all I'm going to say about it, I'm not going to spoil it.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.200
It's not the same as the dungeon fight.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.400
It's very, very different because there's a big twist at the beginning of the fight.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.200
You're not really fighting Yojimbo, you're fighting somebody else.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.760
So that's all I'm going to say about that fight.

14:44.160 --> 14:49.040
And then, let's see, you could do one of the existing primal fights,

14:49.040 --> 14:51.360
which is basically, you know, eight people taking on a boss.

14:51.360 --> 14:56.080
But they would have various modifiers, like the bottom half of your screen is unusable,

14:56.080 --> 14:57.840
or it's covered up entirely, basically,

14:57.840 --> 15:00.400
which kind of sucks because that's where your skills and actions are.

15:01.200 --> 15:06.160
Or other silly modifiers like, you know, you could only use certain type of weapons,

15:06.160 --> 15:09.920
or it was sped up, or, you know, like half health or something.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.960
Like there'd be all these different modifiers, so that was something you could,

15:12.960 --> 15:15.920
I think maybe one was that the bosses didn't telegraph any moves.

15:15.920 --> 15:16.960
That's pretty horrible too.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.400
So yeah, there was, you could play the hard stuff.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.960
There was some type of like Eureka challenge where you kind of,

15:22.960 --> 15:27.040
so they basically had like different little like sub games within the game

15:27.040 --> 15:29.760
that it uses the game's engine and the game's setup,

15:29.760 --> 15:33.840
but they're not really things that you can do in the game right now at home.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.800
So it's kind of neat that they have, you know, that whole thing set up.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.880
And then, of course, they had a big old merchandise booth

15:38.880 --> 15:40.720
and they were selling a lot of that stuff.

15:40.720 --> 15:44.880
And, you know, I know this festival for a lot of people is a chance to meet up with

15:44.880 --> 15:48.400
free company members or guild members and people that they play the game with.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.720
I met a lot of new people.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.960
I had a good time meeting some new people that played the game

15:53.760 --> 15:56.560
and reconnecting with people that I used to play with.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.360
Like one of my old buddies that I played with back on McGarsimer was there.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.680
And so it was really cool to reconnect with him.

16:01.680 --> 16:07.120
And yeah, just, you know, it's about kind of the community as well as the game.

16:07.120 --> 16:15.040
So that was what I kind of, I guess, skipped the show to see last week.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.880
Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

16:20.320 --> 16:23.760
Oh, I guess Shane joined our chat room or somebody that knows him very well

16:23.760 --> 16:26.720
because the nickname is Shane Hates 14 Bloom Age.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.440
Yeah, I know he wasn't too happy with the implementation of that.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.960
Says in our chat says, despite some information that made people matter upset overall,

16:34.960 --> 16:38.080
the con was the best they've done for North America so far.

16:38.080 --> 16:42.480
Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up because I will say that is that the last two times I went,

16:42.480 --> 16:47.280
so they've done this every other year in the even numbered years to announce their other expansions

16:47.280 --> 16:51.440
and 2014 with Heaven's Word, like the registration line was very long.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.360
The merchandise line was a nightmare.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.680
2016 had some issues as well.

16:55.680 --> 17:00.960
So like this year organization, I will give kudos to Square Enix, was done very well.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.360
There was no line for registration.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.960
Like not you walked right up.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.400
They scanned your code. You got your packet. You got your backpack.

17:08.400 --> 17:12.000
I don't know if you saw that when he came in, but I got a little Final Fantasy 14 backpack

17:12.000 --> 17:14.160
and it had like loot inside it. So it's kind of nice.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.680
You just walked right in and pick that up.

17:16.720 --> 17:19.680
Even though they, this was the first year because of, you know,

17:19.680 --> 17:24.960
incidents that have happened in Las Vegas in the not too distant, you know,

17:24.960 --> 17:26.000
past and so forth.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.800
They had metal detectors for the first time that we all had to go through on the way in.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.280
And when I read that they were going to do that, I was like, oh God,

17:31.280 --> 17:33.600
that line to get in is going to be a mile long.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.680
It wasn't. I was pleasantly surprised.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.080
We moved right along into that thing.

17:38.080 --> 17:42.480
They got us through that nice and early to put us in a queue room in the back.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.280
So that way the metal detectors weren't a choke point

17:45.280 --> 17:47.840
because people were lining up as early as like 5, 6 a.m.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.920
I know Shane went out there really, really early the day of the keynote.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.760
And so that was nice that the metal detectors didn't become a bottleneck.

17:55.760 --> 17:59.360
So, and they did the merchandise sales in advance online.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.880
So you have to stand in line all day just to decide what you wanted at the merch booth.

18:02.880 --> 18:07.360
So honestly, they just did a lot of things that made it feel a lot smoother.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.240
But at the same time, because all of it was so smooth,

18:10.240 --> 18:15.600
you really started to notice the whole like, well, I'm kind of out of things to do.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.360
There's no panel right now.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.680
I've done the Yojimbo fight and all this other stuff.

18:20.160 --> 18:24.800
And the thing about Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest is that's all it is,

18:24.800 --> 18:26.320
is Final Fantasy XIV stuff.

18:26.320 --> 18:27.120
But here's the thing.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.320
So you realize you're out of things to do.

18:30.320 --> 18:33.680
That's the time that you go hang out with your free company

18:33.680 --> 18:37.360
or you meet some new people and hang out with them and so forth.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.800
So that's part of the whole experience, I suppose.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.320
Talking about being in the same place and existing at the same time.

18:45.200 --> 18:48.640
We're talking about like the solo experience in an MMO and so forth.

18:48.640 --> 18:49.440
So yeah.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.800
Okay, now I know it's Shane because he knows this.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.720
He says in chat, Rob got stopped every time at the metal detector.

18:56.720 --> 18:57.760
Take that how you will.

18:57.760 --> 18:58.480
Yes, that's true.

18:58.480 --> 19:02.640
I set that metal detector off every single stinking time.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.800
And it wasn't my belt.

19:04.800 --> 19:05.680
It wasn't my watch.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.320
I don't know what it is.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.320
But every single time I was setting off that metal detector.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.760
And they'd have to do the whole wand.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.520
And of course, they don't find anything with a wand.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.320
So I don't know what it is.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.680
It's my magnetic personality.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.440
No, I don't know what was setting it off.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.320
It was weird.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.240
Anyway, let's see.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.760
Looking at other comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.280
Shane is also reminding me to talk about the data centers.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.240
So yeah, with...

19:26.240 --> 19:27.280
And this is the last thing we'll talk about,

19:27.280 --> 19:29.360
because then I want to move on with some of the other headlines from the week.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.720
But one of the other really controversial things they're doing with Final Fantasy XIV,

19:34.720 --> 19:36.880
and I'm going to just flat out say one of the things I don't like.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.720
I know Shane is really pissed off about this blue mage thing.

19:40.720 --> 19:44.080
But honestly, with the blue mage thing, I'm like,

19:44.080 --> 19:47.680
all right, it's there and they can always fix it later.

19:47.680 --> 19:52.080
But this is the thing where I'm like, ugh, I wish they hadn't done this.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.280
But I understand why they're doing it.

19:53.280 --> 19:57.040
So what they're doing is they're making a third data center in North America.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.640
There's already two data centers.

19:58.640 --> 19:59.920
They're making a third.

19:59.920 --> 20:05.200
And here's the thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can do cross data center.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.240
But it's not like World of Warcraft,

20:08.240 --> 20:10.960
where admittedly in the early days of World of Warcraft,

20:10.960 --> 20:12.880
you could only do things on one server.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.800
But about three or four expansions in,

20:14.800 --> 20:17.120
they made it so that it didn't matter what server you were on.

20:17.120 --> 20:20.080
You could party up with people on any other server and so forth.

20:20.080 --> 20:24.000
In Final Fantasy XIV, you're still limited by your data center.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.720
So sure, you can transfer between servers,

20:26.720 --> 20:29.120
but it has to be servers on your data center.

20:29.120 --> 20:32.160
And now in the new expansions in Shadowbringers,

20:32.160 --> 20:34.080
they're going to do this whole world,

20:34.080 --> 20:36.320
or actually, no, I think this is part of the 4.5 patch.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.640
You can even go visit another server,

20:38.640 --> 20:40.960
but it still has to be within the data center.

20:40.960 --> 20:45.840
So there is still this big wall because my friends that I used to play with

20:45.920 --> 20:48.800
are on Midgarcimer, which is one data center,

20:48.800 --> 20:51.200
and I'm on the other one now, Hyperion.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.320
So there's still this wall.

20:52.320 --> 20:55.040
I can't play with the people I used to play with because we're still on this.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.200
And the problem is, in the new expansion,

20:57.200 --> 20:59.280
they're going to be adding a third data center.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.880
So now there's going to be two walls.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.680
And they took the most populated server, Bao Mung,

21:03.680 --> 21:06.560
which there's a lot of inside jokes about Bao Mung and the role play,

21:06.560 --> 21:09.760
and it's going to the third server with a bunch of low pop servers.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.760
So all these people are having to,

21:12.640 --> 21:16.240
if they have a cross-server group that's on a data center,

21:16.240 --> 21:19.120
it might be getting split up because of this change.

21:19.120 --> 21:22.080
But that was also kind of the nice thing about having some downtime,

21:22.080 --> 21:23.760
is that you kind of start to ask people,

21:23.760 --> 21:25.040
so what's your server?

21:25.040 --> 21:27.040
Oh, you're going to be on the new one with me.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.920
OK, so we should talk more because maybe we'll be able to group up.

21:29.920 --> 21:33.600
It's like people are suddenly finding their new homes and things like that.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.840
It's like Final Fantasy XI all over again.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.120
Yeah, yeah, a little bit.

21:37.120 --> 21:41.920
So it's unfortunate about the whole data center thing,

21:41.920 --> 21:44.240
and I really hope in the near future

21:45.040 --> 21:48.400
they can really figure out how to take down those walls of the data center.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.200
But I feel like it's one of those things that they're kind of,

21:52.240 --> 21:54.800
I feel like it's one of those things they're kind of trapped in.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.600
They're kind of trapped into it because of the way the game was built.

21:57.600 --> 22:01.120
Because remember, Final Fantasy XIV had a horrible first version,

22:01.120 --> 22:03.920
and they've been trying to fix it ever since, basically.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.960
So I just have this weird feeling they're kind of screwed in from that,

22:06.960 --> 22:08.240
but we'll see, we'll see.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.240
Anyway, that's enough about Fan Fest.

22:10.240 --> 22:13.280
Is there anything else I should be saying about Fan Fest, Loki?

22:15.280 --> 22:18.400
Any news on Final Fantasy XI Mobile that was supposed to be...

22:18.400 --> 22:20.080
No, this is only a XIV.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.120
No news on anything else but Final Fantasy XIV.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.640
That's about XIV right now.

22:24.640 --> 22:25.440
Yeah, right.

22:25.440 --> 22:30.240
Until it goes like, you know, monthly fee free, then maybe.

22:30.880 --> 22:34.080
Okay, so Bobby Blackwolf in chat, let me explain this better.

22:34.080 --> 22:37.920
Bobby says, oh, so I can't transfer my character over to the server you're on?

22:37.920 --> 22:44.080
So as a kind of like, sorry, we're screwing up all your like pre-mades and stuff.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.800
What they're doing is they're saying for a two-week period,

22:46.800 --> 22:49.760
we are going to offer free server transfers.

22:49.760 --> 22:53.200
So when they create this third data center, it's going to be,

22:53.200 --> 22:56.320
it is going to be a nut house because everybody's going to use this opportunity

22:56.320 --> 22:59.920
of free data transfers to go to where they want to go.

23:00.720 --> 23:03.680
Now, once you've figured out what server you're going to be on,

23:03.680 --> 23:06.400
Final Fantasy is also implementing this.

23:06.400 --> 23:10.400
You can temporarily visit other servers within the data center.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.400
You can just kind of do that within game,

23:12.400 --> 23:17.120
but you'll be locked into that data center once the free move period is over.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.040
So I hope that makes sense because right now,

23:19.040 --> 23:22.640
you can move a character to any server you want for like 15, 18 bucks.

23:22.640 --> 23:23.280
I don't know what it is.

23:23.280 --> 23:24.640
I don't remember what it was I paid,

23:24.640 --> 23:26.800
but they're going to open that up and make it free for two weeks

23:26.800 --> 23:30.320
as their apology to, sorry, we're doing this big shuffle.

23:30.320 --> 23:31.680
We feel bad about it.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.440
So here's your chance to re-pick.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.280
It's going to screw up a lot of housing stuff

23:35.280 --> 23:37.280
because some people have invested a lot of gill in housing,

23:37.280 --> 23:39.760
but they're trying, they're talking about reimbursements,

23:39.760 --> 23:40.400
like 3 million.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.640
They're trying to, they're trying to sweeten the pot.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.000
I just, I don't know.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.120
It's going to be, it's going to be a lot.

23:45.120 --> 23:48.560
So I may not stay where I am, Bobby.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.360
I will let you know.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.040
I will let everybody, I'll tweet about it.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.400
What world I decide to go to.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.600
I honestly have not decided yet.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.320
There's just so many factors.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.080
I really have to kind of figure out

24:00.880 --> 24:04.080
where are the people actually going to be playing regularly?

24:04.080 --> 24:07.520
Because I've kind of hit a ghost town experience

24:07.520 --> 24:10.480
on my old server and I've hit a ghost town experience

24:10.480 --> 24:11.920
on my new server.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.440
So I'll stay on the new server

24:13.440 --> 24:15.120
if it's not going to be a ghost town anymore.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.320
I'll go back to the old server

24:16.320 --> 24:18.000
if it's not going to be a ghost town anymore.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I'll go to a third server, a brand new server,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
if I find out there's a great community here

24:22.000 --> 24:25.280
that, you know, wants to have Rob there and do stuff.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.920
So I honestly don't have the answer to that question yet.

24:27.920 --> 24:31.200
And I think a lot of that will start to sort itself out

24:31.200 --> 24:33.920
when they announce the date of the server transfers.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.120
So I'm just not totally focused on that right now

24:37.120 --> 24:40.400
because, you know, patch 4.5 is still not even out

24:40.400 --> 24:41.120
until January.

24:41.120 --> 24:43.280
So the game is still a little bit stagnant until January.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.760
It's why I've been playing, even though I'm subscribed to 14,

24:45.760 --> 24:47.840
it's why I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft

24:47.840 --> 24:48.800
in between there.

24:48.800 --> 24:51.920
So anyway, let's see.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.800
Hopefully I explained that a little better.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.320
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

24:58.320 --> 25:00.080
I'm also okay with starting from level one

25:00.080 --> 25:01.520
because I forget how to play,

25:01.520 --> 25:03.920
especially if you can access trust from the beginning.

25:03.920 --> 25:07.360
Well, remember, Bobby, you can also just roll a new job

25:07.360 --> 25:09.040
and you'll have to start it from level one.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.080
And that could be another way

25:10.080 --> 25:12.320
because maybe one of these new jobs will speak to you too.

25:12.320 --> 25:13.280
Who knows?

25:13.280 --> 25:15.120
So, you know, you got a lot of options.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.080
So something to think about.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.480
They haven't talked about how the trust

25:18.480 --> 25:19.440
is going to be implemented.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.360
So we'll see what happens with that.

25:22.000 --> 25:22.800
All right.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.720
I think that's all I want to say about Final Fantasy XIV

25:24.720 --> 25:26.400
because I know not everybody plays the MMO

25:26.400 --> 25:27.440
and I've talked at length about it.

25:27.440 --> 25:28.720
We have plenty more news to get to

25:29.280 --> 25:30.960
that has come up in the past couple of weeks.

25:31.520 --> 25:32.400
Before we get to that, though,

25:32.400 --> 25:33.760
let's talk about our gaming weeks

25:33.760 --> 25:35.920
and the types of video games that we have been playing

25:35.920 --> 25:38.160
these past couple of weeks while we've been out.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.440
Loki, how was your gaming week?

25:39.440 --> 25:40.720
My gaming week was all right.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.160
I didn't play a whole ton of things,

25:42.160 --> 25:45.280
but I did play a few things.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.560
So I got around finally to pick,

25:48.560 --> 25:50.400
I mentioned I was going to be picking up

25:52.320 --> 25:54.240
Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.560
So I picked that up and I bought that

25:56.560 --> 25:57.760
and I've been playing that quite a bit.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.200
I'm like 20 hours into it.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.600
I've already taken down five gyms

26:01.600 --> 26:03.920
and I've gotten all the way to Fuchsia City.

26:04.560 --> 26:05.120
Wow.

26:05.120 --> 26:07.440
Where I've got my Pokemon Go Park stuff.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.600
So it's great because, you know, it's like,

26:09.600 --> 26:10.960
oh yeah, there's all these, you know,

26:10.960 --> 26:13.120
version exclusive Pokemon and stuff.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.240
I'm like, fuck that.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.400
I've got like all this crap just sitting

26:16.400 --> 26:17.920
on my Pokemon Go account.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.760
I'm just going to throw it on in there.

26:19.760 --> 26:20.880
Now, what am I doing with it?

26:21.280 --> 26:23.680
Do I really need like 50 different Eevees?

26:23.680 --> 26:24.400
No, I don't.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.640
So I just put that all in there.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.800
So it was great to kind of fill in on that stuff.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.040
So right now I have a Pokemon Go Park

26:31.040 --> 26:32.400
that's just full of like Pokemon.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.960
You can actually have, I think you transfer

26:34.960 --> 26:36.960
up to a thousand Pokemon into that.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.280
So like I'm set for a while.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.080
I should be good.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.840
But I still have to catch everything

26:41.840 --> 26:43.120
because I've ran out of berries.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.560
That's kind of the annoying thing too.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.760
It's like, hey, you know,

26:45.760 --> 26:47.200
whereas like in Pokemon Go,

26:47.200 --> 26:48.560
I have all these berries.

26:48.560 --> 26:50.720
I'm literally like swimming in berries

26:50.720 --> 26:52.080
in Pokemon Let's Go.

26:52.080 --> 26:53.760
You can't fucking find those anywhere.

26:53.760 --> 26:54.880
You have to keep catching things

26:54.880 --> 26:56.000
and you sometimes get them

26:56.000 --> 26:57.600
or you get them as bonuses for other things,

26:57.600 --> 27:00.240
but you can't buy them, which is annoying.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.920
Walk the Pokemon because you get.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.000
I know, I know I do.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.440
I was doing that.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.360
And then the problem is those

27:07.360 --> 27:08.960
I have to keep transferring it back.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.640
And I don't, I keep switching

27:10.640 --> 27:13.280
in between which Pokemon I want to level

27:13.280 --> 27:14.560
up because I'm trying to figure out

27:15.520 --> 27:17.200
what's going to be the best to have

27:17.200 --> 27:18.320
against the final four.

27:19.280 --> 27:19.920
So I don't know.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.360
But I've been playing that quite a bit.

27:23.360 --> 27:24.480
And it's been fun.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.240
I've been a little bit grindy though,

27:26.240 --> 27:29.040
but just, I found that trading

27:29.040 --> 27:31.520
with randoms is also kind of working out too.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.120
I didn't even realize that this was a thing.

27:33.120 --> 27:34.240
So you just put in like,

27:34.240 --> 27:36.240
cause the trading's weird.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.520
You don't like, you don't go

27:37.520 --> 27:38.960
to your friends list or anything

27:38.960 --> 27:40.240
like you would in the other games.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.280
You just basically say,

27:41.280 --> 27:43.040
so you connect online and then you say,

27:43.040 --> 27:45.680
put in a three, it's not even digit.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.200
It's a three picture code.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.800
It's just like, if you've played the rating

27:48.800 --> 27:50.240
in Pokemon Go and done a private raid,

27:50.320 --> 27:50.960
it's just like that.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.240
But you're on the entire internet.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.920
But there's a universal code

27:53.920 --> 27:54.720
that everybody's using,

27:54.720 --> 27:56.560
which is Pikachu, Pikachu, Pikachu.

27:56.560 --> 27:57.840
It's the first one.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.560
And if you do that,

27:58.560 --> 28:00.560
you'll get matched up with some random person.

28:00.560 --> 28:01.920
And so that's why it is like,

28:01.920 --> 28:03.360
I was like, well, let me just check this out

28:03.360 --> 28:03.920
and see whatever.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.440
So I did it and then I was like,

28:05.440 --> 28:06.320
okay, I'm going to give you,

28:06.320 --> 28:08.400
cause I just caught a bunch of slow pokes.

28:08.400 --> 28:12.320
I'm going to give you like a level 38 slow poke.

28:12.320 --> 28:13.440
And so I did that and they,

28:13.440 --> 28:14.800
oh, here, here's the Clefairy.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.000
I'm like, all right, that's cool.

28:16.000 --> 28:16.400
Whatever.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.840
I don't really care what I get.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.840
But the Clefairy they got was like level 53.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.320
Fuck yeah, I'm going to do this some more.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.520
I've been doing the planned trades

28:25.520 --> 28:26.640
with my buddy, Justin,

28:26.640 --> 28:28.080
that I kind of reconnected with

28:28.080 --> 28:29.840
at the Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.120
We've been able to do some trading

28:31.120 --> 28:32.240
cause he has the Eevee version.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.360
I have the Pikachu version.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.640
So we've been able to trade

28:34.640 --> 28:35.760
some of the exclusives across.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.440
And like he texted me the other day

28:37.440 --> 28:39.280
because he's like, do you have Graveler?

28:39.280 --> 28:40.960
He's like in the exact same spot in the game I am.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.640
So he's like, do you have a Graveler

28:42.640 --> 28:44.640
that you want to like trade Graveler for Graveler

28:44.640 --> 28:47.280
because some of the Pokemon evolve by trading them.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.440
So we did Graveler for Graveler.

28:49.440 --> 28:50.960
So that way we both got Golems.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.080
And then I think we need to do it again

28:52.800 --> 28:54.880
for the Kadabras to get Alakazams.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.880
So I've been doing the pre-planned trades.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.720
I haven't tried the random stuff though, but.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.560
I should probably trade those then

29:00.560 --> 29:02.080
cause I can't do anything with them

29:02.080 --> 29:02.880
if they're just gonna sit there.

29:02.880 --> 29:03.920
I'll just trade them.

29:03.920 --> 29:04.560
Do you have your Switch?

29:04.560 --> 29:05.200
Let's trade.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.400
I don't have my Switch with me.

29:06.400 --> 29:07.520
I thought about bringing it.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.960
I almost did, but I didn't.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.040
Next time.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.640
Yeah, like Sia Tabiri in chat says

29:12.640 --> 29:13.680
grav for grav.

29:13.680 --> 29:14.800
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

29:14.800 --> 29:15.200
G for G.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.800
But yeah, and also it's nice

29:16.800 --> 29:20.320
that each of the Pokemon centers

29:20.320 --> 29:22.320
they have like people that'll trade you

29:22.320 --> 29:23.520
the Alolan Pokemon.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.960
So I got an Alolan Marowak,

29:24.960 --> 29:26.960
which cause I don't even have that in Pokemon Go.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.120
So just too bad because they had one

29:29.120 --> 29:30.480
on the gym over here.

29:30.480 --> 29:31.920
Just right when I came in.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.400
I'm like, oh, there's someone battling him.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.160
I can't.

29:36.160 --> 29:37.680
Three stars or four stars.

29:37.680 --> 29:38.080
Don't.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.360
Can't solo that.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.320
It's like recommend party.

29:40.320 --> 29:40.960
13 people.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.360
There's some of the three stars

29:43.360 --> 29:44.240
you can do yourself.

29:44.240 --> 29:44.800
Yeah, yeah.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.320
Anyways.

29:46.320 --> 29:48.080
So I've been playing that quite a bit.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.360
And then aside from that,

29:50.000 --> 29:50.960
you know, Pokemon Go,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.720
I did ended up picking up the controller,

29:54.720 --> 29:57.200
the Pokeball Plus only because my kids

29:57.200 --> 29:57.920
wanted to play with it.

29:57.920 --> 30:00.320
My youngest son was like really wanting

30:00.320 --> 30:02.080
to play Pokemon and he wanted the ball.

30:02.080 --> 30:05.280
So like I picked it up and then my oldest son

30:05.280 --> 30:06.800
wanted me to give him Mew.

30:07.760 --> 30:08.240
I'm like.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.000
But I bought this myself.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.600
You know, when you get a job,

30:13.600 --> 30:16.160
you can have me up to, you know, I'm like fine.

30:16.560 --> 30:17.520
I'll give it to you.

30:17.520 --> 30:19.360
Unfortunately, you can't give it to him

30:19.360 --> 30:21.440
because he doesn't have a Nintendo account.

30:21.440 --> 30:24.000
So sorry, you're out of luck.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.200
So I had to transfer Mew over.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.880
Mew actually is all right, but.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.720
The only positive with Mew is you can give it

30:30.720 --> 30:34.400
any of the TMS so you can, you know,

30:34.400 --> 30:36.960
kind of customize Mew however you want.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.880
Yeah, I have Mew in my party right now,

30:38.880 --> 30:40.160
but I'm probably going to take him out.

30:40.160 --> 30:43.280
Like I just I need other like harder counters,

30:43.280 --> 30:44.160
if that makes sense.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.520
Yeah, I need things like

30:45.520 --> 30:46.080
ride on.

30:46.080 --> 30:46.960
I need things like, you know,

30:46.960 --> 30:48.720
that are just like really big.

30:48.720 --> 30:52.080
I still haven't been able to get mine to evolve yet.

30:52.080 --> 30:53.360
My ride on.

30:54.720 --> 30:55.680
I don't know if that's one of the ones

30:55.680 --> 30:57.200
you have to trade or if you just it's

30:57.200 --> 30:58.320
a higher level when it flips.

30:58.320 --> 31:01.120
Whatever, if it doesn't, you know.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.360
Just transfer in a Brian once you go.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.040
Yeah, like, yeah, seriously.

31:05.040 --> 31:06.640
So that's kind of what I've been doing.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.600
And then let's see, aside from that.

31:11.360 --> 31:14.320
So my DDR machine finally got the replacement

31:15.200 --> 31:17.040
optical drive in last week.

31:17.760 --> 31:19.360
And sure enough, I put it in there

31:19.360 --> 31:20.720
and it doesn't fucking work.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.240
So so then there was that problem

31:24.240 --> 31:26.080
and it started acting up like I was like,

31:26.080 --> 31:27.440
OK, well, what's wrong with this thing?

31:27.440 --> 31:30.400
Because it kept popping the tray out a bunch of times

31:30.400 --> 31:32.560
and it just was not cooperating.

31:32.560 --> 31:33.280
It wouldn't read it.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.680
So I ended up having to take the optical drive apart

31:35.680 --> 31:39.120
and I fixed it because I guess as they get older,

31:39.120 --> 31:41.840
the motors to pop the trays open and stuff like that,

31:41.840 --> 31:43.440
they wear out.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.320
And so you have to basically break the magnet

31:48.320 --> 31:50.080
that's in there a little bit and, you know,

31:50.080 --> 31:54.400
tweak it up so that it's higher off of the metal

31:54.400 --> 31:56.320
so that it's not strong.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.360
And then it works just fine.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.200
And sure enough, as soon as I did all that

31:59.200 --> 32:01.760
and tweaked it and put it back together, it worked fine.

32:01.760 --> 32:06.000
So I was able to put fourth plus on my DDR machine now.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.320
So that's what I'm being playing this week.

32:08.560 --> 32:13.200
Um, although I miss having my speed mods already,

32:14.080 --> 32:19.120
I'm like, man, I loved fourth plus or fourth mix,

32:19.120 --> 32:23.600
but I'm so spoiled I can't do it anymore.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.360
It's like, you know, it's trying to play doubles.

32:25.360 --> 32:30.240
I was playing a conga feeling and I love that song,

32:30.240 --> 32:33.360
but it's just it's going to have to get used to

32:33.360 --> 32:34.400
reading that stuff again.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.160
I can't wait to come over and play your DDR machine.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.680
We just had a day to do that.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.280
Yeah, awesome.

32:39.280 --> 32:39.840
So anytime.

32:40.400 --> 32:40.720
Okay.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.160
Anything else for your gaming week?

32:42.160 --> 32:45.120
Um, no, that's it.

32:45.120 --> 32:46.720
I didn't play any Red Dead Redemption,

32:46.720 --> 32:47.600
which is too bad.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.680
I'm having trouble like getting back into that

32:49.680 --> 32:52.240
because it's just so like engrossing.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.800
Um, I, I'm loving some of the clips I'm seeing

32:54.800 --> 32:55.760
coming out of that game.

32:55.760 --> 32:58.720
Like the, the lady was like, won't you help me?

32:58.720 --> 33:00.960
And like, then she gets run over by a horse.

33:00.960 --> 33:04.000
Like, just like out of nowhere, this horse comes just like,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.080
it's, I guess it might be like a bug,

33:06.080 --> 33:07.440
but it's like a really funny bug.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.400
AI is never been like, great.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.000
I mean, they, they do pretty well,

33:12.000 --> 33:13.840
but like sometimes the pathfinding and stuff

33:13.840 --> 33:15.040
is not really great.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.040
And also deer are kind of crazy,

33:17.040 --> 33:19.120
but there's a lot of weird shit in that game.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.840
Like there's like UFOs and ghosts and all sorts of like,

33:21.840 --> 33:23.280
there's time travelers and stuff.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.360
And there's, there's ties between this and

33:25.360 --> 33:29.920
Grand Theft Auto five with, um, the, uh, Epsilon cult thing,

33:30.640 --> 33:32.800
Epsilon project or, and so weird.

33:32.800 --> 33:36.240
I want to play Red Dead, but I'm not until it goes on sale,

33:36.240 --> 33:37.680
which will be a good long time.

33:37.680 --> 33:40.240
So it won't be that long, but it's a great game.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.200
It's definitely worth it.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.000
Um, I just, it's, it's very engrossing.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.920
And I just, I haven't been able to work,

33:45.920 --> 33:47.280
be on the TV is the problem.

33:47.280 --> 33:50.320
It's my wife's been still watching all sorts of garbage.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.320
What Shondaverse show is she on now?

33:52.320 --> 33:56.160
She just finished season two of a Handmaid's Tale.

33:56.160 --> 34:00.320
So now she's watching, I don't even fucking know.

34:00.320 --> 34:01.200
It's just garbage.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.160
It's all garbage.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.760
Like I don't even care anymore.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.360
It's just, it's some drama.

34:05.360 --> 34:08.080
It's, it's anything that's got a drama in it, you know?

34:09.360 --> 34:12.960
Look, we have goddamn fucking Netflix on the TV in the bedroom.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.680
It's like you can watch TV and sit in bed.

34:15.680 --> 34:17.040
I'm almost at the point where I have to move

34:17.040 --> 34:18.640
my PlayStation in the bedroom, but like,

34:19.680 --> 34:22.880
I have a 4k fucking TV and a PlayStation pro.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.640
I don't want to move it onto the tape.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.120
And you lose on the switch.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.560
You could watch that literally anywhere.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.480
Well, we don't necessarily have Hulu.

34:30.480 --> 34:33.040
We have a wild world on the internet.

34:33.040 --> 34:33.360
I see.

34:33.360 --> 34:34.400
Oh, I thought you were watching him.

34:35.040 --> 34:35.600
No, no.

34:35.600 --> 34:35.760
Yeah.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.840
Hulu would be nice too, but we just don't do it.

34:39.200 --> 34:40.400
So I haven't been able to play that.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.520
And my friends wanted me to get like Fallout 76,

34:43.520 --> 34:44.720
but that game is shit.

34:44.720 --> 34:47.840
So, you know, but I like shit games sometimes.

34:47.840 --> 34:51.440
I just don't want to pay, I don't know, $40 for it.

34:51.440 --> 34:53.440
I don't usually get super into the Fallout games.

34:53.440 --> 34:56.800
Like I think Ma, the, the, the, um, I almost said the Skyrim games,

34:56.800 --> 34:59.120
the Elder Scrolls games are kind of more my thing.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.480
I live for from Bethesda.

35:00.480 --> 35:01.680
I've tried the Fallout games.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.120
I just don't really get into them the same way,

35:03.120 --> 35:05.200
but I'm not hearing good things about this new one.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.600
Like, I'm just like, everything I'm hearing about this new one is like,

35:08.240 --> 35:11.600
like, I guess maybe passing on this is probably the right thing to do.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.520
They've already dropped it half price now.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.800
That's $39.99.

35:14.800 --> 35:15.680
That's crazy to me.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.440
It's seriously, this game is like,

35:18.800 --> 35:20.720
it's no man's sky all over again.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.000
It just seems like it was half baked.

35:22.000 --> 35:22.240
Yeah.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.520
Oh, it wasn't even half baked.

35:23.520 --> 35:24.640
It was like quarter baked.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.720
You're like, it is eating the cookie dough.

35:26.720 --> 35:31.520
It is like you might, those raw eggs might kill you.

35:32.160 --> 35:36.320
Like it, it's just, it's, it's bad.

35:37.440 --> 35:40.640
It's bad, but like everybody I talked to, they're having a lot of fun with it,

35:40.640 --> 35:44.400
but like as some of the, one of the online reviews I watched,

35:44.400 --> 35:46.720
you know, they, they compared it to like Billy Madison,

35:46.720 --> 35:50.640
where Billy Madison proves that you can have fun with a flaming bag of shit.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.080
It's like why I watch showgirls.

35:54.080 --> 35:54.880
Yeah, you can have movies.

35:54.880 --> 35:58.880
You can have fun with all sorts of dumb shit with friends.

35:58.880 --> 35:59.520
I get it.

35:59.520 --> 36:02.160
But it doesn't mean it's a good thing.

36:02.160 --> 36:02.880
I hear you.

36:02.880 --> 36:03.120
All right.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.560
So that's, that's, that's my game.

36:04.560 --> 36:04.800
All right.

36:04.800 --> 36:05.680
My gaming week.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.120
I've also been playing Pokemon.

36:07.120 --> 36:07.760
Let's go.

36:07.760 --> 36:10.080
Um, um, Loki's talked at length about it.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.960
I won't say a whole lot more except for, I like the fact that it's just basically

36:12.960 --> 36:14.080
like Pokemon yellow.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.840
Cause I have a Pikachu version as well.

36:15.840 --> 36:19.760
And I saw a question in chat earlier that asked why, why the Pikachu version,

36:19.760 --> 36:20.880
not the Eevee version.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.640
My kids, they want a Pikachu.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.920
I know I could have gotten Eevee because Pikachu is literally like

36:27.040 --> 36:29.120
right there at the beginning of the game.

36:29.120 --> 36:29.520
Yeah.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.120
But they wanted me to get the Pikachu version.

36:31.120 --> 36:35.200
Um, I got the Pikachu version because just kind of informal poll on Twitter

36:35.200 --> 36:38.560
of everybody else I know like Eevee seemed to be the more popular one.

36:38.560 --> 36:42.400
So I got Pikachu just so I could do the trading so that that's really it.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.080
There wasn't a whole lot of thought beyond that.

36:44.560 --> 36:48.160
Um, and now thanks to the connection with Pokemon go and the fighting,

36:48.160 --> 36:49.920
you just pretty much bring anything in from that.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.240
Like you don't even really need, it doesn't really matter which version of

36:52.240 --> 36:53.840
the game you have, I guess in that regard.

36:53.840 --> 36:58.160
Um, but I do like it, it kind of does feel Loki like a, a Bobby black Wolf

36:58.160 --> 37:01.600
mode version of, and if you don't know that inside joke, that's what

37:01.600 --> 37:04.960
you call like the easy mode of a game is Bobby black Wolf mode.

37:04.960 --> 37:08.320
Uh, is, uh, it kind of feels like the Bobby black Wolf mode of Pokemon

37:08.320 --> 37:11.920
yellow because I do, I got to admit, I love that they took the like

37:11.920 --> 37:15.440
grinding of the catching of the mobs out of it and they've just replaced

37:15.440 --> 37:18.320
it with the much simpler, like flick your wrist and catch it that way.

37:18.320 --> 37:19.360
Still pretty grindy.

37:19.360 --> 37:23.680
And I don't even do the flicking wrist stuff because I use it in handheld

37:23.680 --> 37:24.000
mode.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.880
So for me, it's just motion controls.

37:26.960 --> 37:27.360
No, I do.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.880
I, I, I was able to get the flick.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.400
I can even throw them left and right now.

37:30.400 --> 37:33.200
I kind of figured out how to, you just, what you do, you, you move your

37:33.200 --> 37:39.520
hand to the right and you do a quarter turn of the little, um, no, but

37:39.520 --> 37:41.760
that's how you make sure that's how I throw things to the right and the

37:41.760 --> 37:44.720
left every time is as I actually throw it to the left, I do a quarter

37:44.720 --> 37:47.040
turn of the controller and it always nails it.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.840
So that's, that's kind of what's worked for me.

37:49.840 --> 37:55.760
Um, but I, I got basically in, I'm only catch one of each Pokemon and

37:55.760 --> 37:59.600
then I move on like, and I think I have kind of missed some stuff.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.480
I think you have to get that catch combo going in order to get your

38:02.480 --> 38:03.120
shinies.

38:03.120 --> 38:04.800
Yeah, but I don't need shinies right out the gate.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.680
You know what I need to do is beat a fucking Pokemon game.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.280
Then I'll go back and get the shinies.

38:09.280 --> 38:12.240
If you complete the pokey decks, you'll get a shiny charm.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.920
Then they'll make catching the shinies either.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.160
So I don't give a fuck about shinies right now.

38:16.160 --> 38:18.080
I want to get mildly easier.

38:18.080 --> 38:21.280
I'm sick of getting teased because I cannot beat a Pokemon game.

38:21.280 --> 38:22.400
So I'm going to beat this one.

38:22.400 --> 38:22.800
Damn it.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.240
I'm, I'm not as far as you though.

38:24.240 --> 38:28.080
I'm only three gyms down, but there's a long trek between gyms two and three.

38:28.080 --> 38:30.640
And then now there's another long trek trek between three and four.

38:30.640 --> 38:35.280
So I just did the ghost tower, but I wasn't able to get all the way at the

38:35.280 --> 38:36.080
top.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.560
So then I had to trigger the team rocket sequence.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.760
And that's about where I'm at right now without saying too much where I'm at.

38:41.760 --> 38:47.120
Um, but honestly, because then it just ends up being battle, battle, battle.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.600
Like you just battle all the NPCs over and over and over again.

38:49.600 --> 38:52.160
Like that's kind of how I grind NPCs by doing that.

38:52.240 --> 38:55.520
And by walking the Pokemon and Poke ball, because you get an insane amount of XP

38:55.520 --> 38:55.760
from that.

38:55.760 --> 38:59.360
And you can avoid a lot of them too, but like, I don't know.

38:59.360 --> 39:01.120
You need it for XP.

39:01.120 --> 39:04.960
So yeah, that's how I get my XP because I'm not really catching.

39:04.960 --> 39:07.600
So anyway, that's enough said about a Pokemon.

39:07.600 --> 39:08.000
Let's go.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.800
I think if you're a fan of the Pokemon series, you've probably already.

39:10.800 --> 39:14.320
I always, I just pick them up because anything that you pick up, that's extra.

39:14.320 --> 39:18.640
Those, the stuff you can trade them in to the professor for candy and for candy.

39:18.640 --> 39:20.960
And you can stat boost your Pokemon that way.

39:20.960 --> 39:23.120
Yeah, I figure I can always go back and do that again.

39:23.120 --> 39:28.400
The walking Loki you get, I know I get, I have, I've gotten so much Charmander

39:28.400 --> 39:28.880
candy.

39:28.880 --> 39:33.280
I've probably like poured like 40 Charmander candies into my now Charmeleon,

39:33.280 --> 39:35.200
who I'm surprised is not a Charizard at this point.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.840
Cause the other two are Venusaur.

39:37.840 --> 39:38.400
Yeah, I know.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.920
I think it's just like one or two levels behind.

39:40.800 --> 39:44.800
But anyway, um, so anyhow, talking about some other things I've played this week,

39:44.800 --> 39:48.320
of course, I've been continuing on in Final Fantasy 14 because, uh, you know,

39:48.320 --> 39:50.800
the, uh, the festival kind of got me jazzed on that again.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.160
But I've also been playing World of Warcraft.

39:52.160 --> 39:55.680
So my buddy Delvin has been helping me run through some mythics and I'll plug

39:55.680 --> 39:57.680
his Twitch channel over at VG realness.

39:57.680 --> 40:00.640
Cause sometimes I pop in on his Twitch channel over there.

40:00.640 --> 40:04.000
Um, and, uh, we'll do, uh, some mythics.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.080
I've done some mythics with him and some other stuff.

40:06.080 --> 40:10.000
I've also been oddly getting back into PVP, which I didn't think was something I

40:10.000 --> 40:13.760
was into, but it's really fun on an affliction warlock for any of you that are

40:13.760 --> 40:14.560
into wow.

40:14.560 --> 40:17.280
Um, you will be very happy to know this Loki.

40:17.280 --> 40:20.560
One of the thing I did this week is I really spent some time with the VR

40:20.640 --> 40:23.360
playing some other games besides just Tetris effect.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.000
Don't get me wrong.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.880
I played Tetris effect cause I wasn't able to do last week's event cause I was

40:26.880 --> 40:27.520
in Vegas.

40:27.520 --> 40:30.400
I made sure to do the one this weekend and I finally, yeah, that's right.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.480
They have events every Saturday.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.600
So oops, you missed it.

40:33.600 --> 40:38.240
Uh, but during that time you can play the 1989 skin too, which I think you

40:38.240 --> 40:42.160
unlock at some point anyway, but you're able to play it during the weekend.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.160
That 1989 skin is awesome.

40:44.160 --> 40:48.560
The it's the old school, like Game Boy Tetris, but they, they kind of like the

40:48.560 --> 40:51.200
song morphs as it does in other skins.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.880
And so it's like the chip tune version at first.

40:52.880 --> 40:56.320
And then it's just like totally like, like drum and bass, boom, boom, boom,

40:56.320 --> 40:58.560
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

40:58.560 --> 40:59.680
You know, like that whole thing.

40:59.680 --> 41:00.240
And it's really cool.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.800
And then we get to the end of the stage is like fireworks.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.160
It looks really great in VR.

41:04.160 --> 41:04.960
I loved it.

41:04.960 --> 41:08.080
Um, so I've been playing a little bit of that, but I also went and I finally

41:08.080 --> 41:10.480
played some rez in VR, which was great.

41:10.480 --> 41:15.680
I played, finally got to play area X in VR, which is gorgeous.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.200
And obviously the song is great.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.720
It was a little short, but here, I'm going to tell you why area X bugs me

41:20.720 --> 41:20.880
though.

41:20.880 --> 41:21.360
Like I loved it.

41:21.360 --> 41:25.840
Don't get me wrong, but didn't area X totally feel like a proof of concept

41:25.840 --> 41:27.280
for like rez too.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.000
Yeah.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.200
Like what?

41:29.200 --> 41:34.400
Cause the weird thing is when you launch area X, it takes forever to load

41:34.400 --> 41:35.520
because it's its own game.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.400
It's its own thing.

41:36.400 --> 41:36.560
Yeah.

41:36.560 --> 41:37.520
It's its own like separate thing.

41:37.520 --> 41:41.200
It's not, it's not like they built a new area in the first game's engine.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.360
They made a new engine out of unreal.

41:43.360 --> 41:46.640
If you read the credits, the unreal engine is credited.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.720
So they made a brand new engine for rez.

41:48.720 --> 41:50.320
They did that just for one area.

41:50.880 --> 41:54.560
I'm sorry, but that is a proof of concept of a new rez game that I am being

41:54.560 --> 41:55.360
denied right now.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.200
It's just like, you know, the home versions of DDR, where do you get the,

41:59.200 --> 42:01.840
you know, the preview songs for the next mix in there?

42:01.840 --> 42:03.360
They need to greenlight rez too.

42:03.360 --> 42:04.480
Cause that was awesome.

42:04.480 --> 42:05.760
I loved that playing.

42:05.760 --> 42:06.880
That was so cool.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.680
There's actually, did you, there's things that, that, in that, that kind of

42:09.680 --> 42:10.720
are in Tetris effect too.

42:11.440 --> 42:15.840
When you get enough of the powerups, your guy turns into the yoga kind of

42:15.920 --> 42:16.800
thing floating through.

42:16.800 --> 42:20.240
And that is the same thing you see in Tetris effect.

42:20.240 --> 42:22.800
When you're doing the relax modes, the little dude in the background does

42:22.800 --> 42:24.800
like the similar poses from rez area.

42:24.800 --> 42:26.480
I swear it's like the same thing.

42:26.480 --> 42:31.200
So I think, I think there are subtle connections between the enhanced games.

42:31.200 --> 42:34.560
I think Tetris effect is made in unreal as well.

42:34.560 --> 42:36.240
Oh, I, I'm sure it is.

42:36.240 --> 42:37.520
I'm sure a lot of the stuff.

42:38.080 --> 42:40.640
I wonder they credit an engine.

42:40.640 --> 42:43.680
They call it something like the Synthasia engine.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.680
I wonder Synthasia or something like that.

42:45.760 --> 42:49.280
I wonder if in the Tetris effects credits, that same engine isn't credited.

42:50.080 --> 42:53.280
I would bet Tetris and rez X are built on the same engine.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.000
Probably.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.800
I wonder if somebody in chat knows that over at live.vognetwork.com.

42:56.800 --> 43:00.000
Oh, Bobby Blackwell confirms that Tetris effect is made in unreal.

43:00.000 --> 43:00.960
So there is that.

43:01.600 --> 43:04.960
So I wonder if it is the same engine.

43:04.960 --> 43:10.000
So anyway, uh, I also played Thumper in VR, which that was that music game.

43:10.000 --> 43:10.560
That's really hard.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.240
They call it like the music horror game.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.080
And of course, obviously in VR, that's really cool.

43:14.080 --> 43:17.760
I had played that once before I think Shane or somebody had brought their VR

43:17.760 --> 43:21.040
over and I think I did play Thumper, but you know, I got to kind of sit down

43:21.040 --> 43:23.440
with it a little more and play that game is hard.

43:23.440 --> 43:27.120
I don't like calling that a music game because I flop that game so hard.

43:27.120 --> 43:27.760
It did.

43:27.760 --> 43:32.240
And I didn't get that yet, but I plan to, I just didn't get around to it this week.

43:32.240 --> 43:35.680
So, um, and I think, I think that's about it.

43:35.680 --> 43:42.080
Oh, I did a quick stream of Metroid, like 8-bit Metroid, because, um, if you set up

43:42.080 --> 43:45.600
a Japanese Switch account, which is very easy to do, you just do it online.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.760
You set your region in Japan, make a Japanese account.

43:47.760 --> 43:48.160
It's free.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.080
It doesn't cost anything you can go on.

43:50.080 --> 43:53.600
If you use that account on your Switch, you can go onto the Japanese store and

43:53.600 --> 43:58.240
you can download the Famicom game collection, which for the most part is

43:58.240 --> 44:00.720
not a big deal because it's the same games.

44:00.720 --> 44:04.080
It's not like the classic NES and the classic Famicom have like different games.

44:04.080 --> 44:05.280
It's not like that on Switch.

44:05.280 --> 44:09.600
It's all the same games, except I didn't even realize this Japanese got the SP

44:09.600 --> 44:12.960
golf, what, how many of you are really playing that golf game?

44:12.960 --> 44:13.440
Okay.

44:13.440 --> 44:17.360
So Japanese got the S special golf with everything unlocked, but here's the thing,

44:17.360 --> 44:22.800
because it is based off the Famicom stuff, Metroid was a disc game on the Famicom.

44:22.800 --> 44:27.200
So when you play Metroid on the Famicom version, you get the thing that looks

44:27.200 --> 44:30.720
like the Legend of Zelda, where you have your save files to select from.

44:30.720 --> 44:34.400
There's loading times between some of the different zones because it's emulating the

44:34.400 --> 44:38.560
disc, but also remember the Famicom had that extra sound chip thing.

44:38.560 --> 44:42.080
So there are some subtle noise and sound differences.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.800
Like the ice beam makes a very different sound.

44:44.800 --> 44:47.360
Those little birds that fly down from the ceiling to try to get you,

44:47.360 --> 44:49.280
they make a very, very different noise as well.

44:49.280 --> 44:51.600
So I actually did a live stream to just look at some of those,

44:51.600 --> 44:53.920
just those little, very, very subtle nuances.

44:53.920 --> 44:56.000
But I, those, that's the kind of shit I love.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.120
I love looking like at those subtle differences between what we got and what

44:59.120 --> 45:02.320
Japan got because back then the hardware was kind of different.

45:02.320 --> 45:02.560
Yeah.

45:02.560 --> 45:03.280
So, yeah.

45:03.280 --> 45:06.720
So I did a little stream of that and I got to do some classic 8-bit Metroid, so.

45:06.720 --> 45:12.400
Well, I was watching, I guess they did some, um, an AGDQ type like impromptu thing

45:12.400 --> 45:16.560
during some sort of, I don't even know what it was, but like recently.

45:16.560 --> 45:20.640
So I watched, they did, someone did a randomizer with the, the Zelda, um,

45:20.640 --> 45:22.880
Link to the Past, Super Metroid randomizer.

45:23.600 --> 45:24.960
But both games at once?

45:24.960 --> 45:25.200
Yeah.

45:25.200 --> 45:32.080
So what it does is, is, so the way it works is basically there's four points in, um,

45:32.080 --> 45:34.800
Super Metroid that link to, uh, Link to the Past.

45:34.800 --> 45:40.320
So you go between the games as, you know, the characters and the items from each are

45:40.880 --> 45:42.240
strewn about in the other games.

45:42.240 --> 45:45.360
Like all of, so they have some Link to the Past items that are in Link to the Past

45:45.360 --> 45:49.200
and some are in Super Metroid.

45:49.200 --> 45:52.960
That sounds like what the Nintendo player championships thing, you know,

45:52.960 --> 45:56.320
how like the cart would more like you, you get to a certain point rad racer and then

45:56.320 --> 46:00.160
you're playing Tetris and then you're collecting coins and Mario brothers and all that stuff.

46:00.160 --> 46:02.160
Like, remember how that cartridge would move between the games?

46:02.160 --> 46:04.720
That's kind of what it sounds like, but like cooler.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.000
Yeah, but yeah, this keeps going.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.360
Like, so they had, what they had is they had two speedrunners, um, doing it.

46:09.360 --> 46:14.160
One guy who was an expert at like Zelda and the other one was more of an expert at Link

46:14.160 --> 46:15.600
to the Past and they kept swapping.

46:15.600 --> 46:16.800
You mean Zelda Metroid?

46:16.800 --> 46:17.760
Yeah, sorry.

46:17.760 --> 46:17.920
Yeah.

46:19.920 --> 46:24.320
So they, they were kind of, uh, you know, better suited at each one.

46:25.280 --> 46:28.480
And so they were kind of doing that and like, you know, they'd find, oh, hey, here's the,

46:29.360 --> 46:33.440
you know, here's some arrows in Metroid and here's,

46:33.440 --> 46:36.000
you know, here's the various suit in Link to the Past.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.240
And it was neat.

46:38.240 --> 46:38.960
I don't know.

46:38.960 --> 46:39.840
It'd be fun to play.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.440
Yeah, I want to play that.

46:41.440 --> 46:42.240
Where's that ROM?

46:42.240 --> 46:42.880
I want to check that out.

46:42.880 --> 46:43.920
That sounds really cool.

46:43.920 --> 46:44.480
Yeah.

46:44.480 --> 46:44.720
All right.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.080
So that's it for our gaming weeks.

46:46.080 --> 46:50.560
So, um, housekeeping, I'll just say follow us on Twitter at twitter.com slash, uh, OLR.

46:50.560 --> 46:54.480
We're also on Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio and follow the network over at Twitch TV,

46:54.480 --> 46:56.400
VOG Network, all one word.

46:56.640 --> 46:58.560
We will not be using the Orange Lounge Radio channel.

46:58.560 --> 47:02.560
We're going to be kind of combining our forces all to one place, the VOG Network channel.

47:02.560 --> 47:07.200
I don't, I, I'm not going to say never say never to the Orange Lounge Radio Twitch channels.

47:07.200 --> 47:08.080
You can follow that too.

47:08.080 --> 47:11.200
But, uh, yeah, I'm going to be pointing people to the VOG Network channel.

47:11.200 --> 47:15.520
I know Bobby thinks y'all should wait, uh, to see some of the stuff he's got for the,

47:15.520 --> 47:17.920
the followers and all that stuff when we go live.

47:17.920 --> 47:22.000
But I want to get to that 50 follower account sooner rather than later.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.160
So there'll be hopefully more followers in the future too.

47:24.160 --> 47:25.280
So, so we'll see.

47:25.920 --> 47:28.880
But, uh, anyway, let's get to some other gaming news now.

47:28.880 --> 47:32.160
Um, again, this week we are going to cover kind of two weeks worth of news because the

47:32.160 --> 47:35.760
week the news was a little lighter this week with it being Thanksgiving and all that.

47:35.760 --> 47:40.320
So we are going to cover things from across both weeks as opposed to doing like a cramming

47:40.320 --> 47:42.400
last week's news all into a three minute segment.

47:42.400 --> 47:46.480
We're going to kind of just cause there's a big holidays, like these first couple of

47:46.480 --> 47:49.520
things that came up, there's some big things that happened while we were gone.

47:49.520 --> 47:50.000
We were gone.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.440
We need to get into, so let's get into it.

47:51.440 --> 47:52.240
Loki.

47:52.240 --> 47:57.280
So yeah, so yeah, like the last few steam sales, the steam link has been marked down

47:57.280 --> 47:58.160
quite a bit now.

47:58.160 --> 48:00.240
I think they were selling it for $2 and 50 cents.

48:00.240 --> 48:07.440
I've got mine either free or for a dollar, um, with a game at one point on here.

48:07.440 --> 48:12.320
But the reason why it's being marked down is because they are selling it out.

48:12.320 --> 48:15.680
They have declared that they're not making any more of the hardware.

48:15.680 --> 48:20.560
They're phasing it out so you can get your hands on a steam link, uh, cheap.

48:20.560 --> 48:25.040
And I think a steam controller as well, uh, while supplies last.

48:25.040 --> 48:29.280
Apparently the, it is sold out in Europe and almost sold out in the U S and once they're

48:29.280 --> 48:34.560
gone, uh, they plan on continuing support for the existing hardware, but they're not

48:34.560 --> 48:38.800
going to be, um, distributing any more of the standalone hardware.

48:38.800 --> 48:44.080
Instead, what they're going to be doing is using, um, smartphones, tablets and other

48:44.080 --> 48:50.560
Intellivisions to be able to use the steam app to do the steam link stuff, which makes

48:50.560 --> 48:58.560
sense because like, for example, my one streaming device I have, it has a steam link app in

48:58.560 --> 49:01.600
it so I can use that if I wanted to the stream games.

49:01.600 --> 49:05.600
Although I have a laptop, so it's kind of pointless, but I have it anyways, just in

49:05.600 --> 49:07.200
case I wanted to.

49:07.200 --> 49:09.760
Um, and my phone has that too.

49:09.760 --> 49:13.280
So I haven't actually tried that, but it'd be neat.

49:13.280 --> 49:13.600
Yeah.

49:13.600 --> 49:17.440
I bought a steam link and I bought them when they were still like probably $50.

49:17.440 --> 49:19.840
So I feel a little burned, but that's okay.

49:19.840 --> 49:24.560
I mean, you know, I got what I paid for and I did, I liked the controller a lot and I

49:24.560 --> 49:27.120
did like the device, but I can't really put my finger.

49:27.120 --> 49:29.440
And this is the question I'm going to ask kind of to everybody here.

49:29.440 --> 49:30.080
Like, I don't know.

49:30.080 --> 49:32.560
Well, part one, are you surprised by this news?

49:32.560 --> 49:33.060
No.

49:33.520 --> 49:33.840
Okay.

49:33.840 --> 49:34.560
Part two.

49:34.560 --> 49:35.120
Why then?

49:35.120 --> 49:36.480
What, why did steam link?

49:37.520 --> 49:39.200
Why didn't it, I guess, succeed?

49:39.760 --> 49:46.400
I'm not surprised because they dropped support for like steam boxes so quickly and it makes

49:46.400 --> 49:47.920
sense that they would have dropped support for this.

49:48.480 --> 49:52.480
You know, it's just hardware doesn't, this doesn't seem to be a thing that people

49:52.480 --> 49:54.320
necessarily need.

49:54.320 --> 50:00.960
Like, you know, if you're going to be playing games on like a PC and stuff, most people

50:00.960 --> 50:05.120
are just hooking their PCs up to their TV or they're hooking their, they were just

50:05.120 --> 50:06.480
playing on their PC.

50:06.480 --> 50:13.680
There's not really a big demand for playing a PC game, you know, on your TV and streaming

50:13.680 --> 50:17.360
it over, you know, the wifi to play the same thing.

50:18.080 --> 50:18.960
I guess it makes sense.

50:18.960 --> 50:23.520
Like if you have like in an office or something like that, but it's just, I think people

50:23.520 --> 50:24.400
are just so comfortable.

50:24.400 --> 50:27.920
Like when you think about like someone's computer set up, like they have a nice keyboard,

50:27.920 --> 50:31.680
they have a nice mouse, they have a nice gaming chair, possibly that they're sitting

50:31.680 --> 50:32.640
in nice monitors.

50:33.280 --> 50:35.760
Why would I leave that to go somewhere else?

50:35.760 --> 50:38.400
Unless you do like trying to do like a party game or something like that.

50:38.400 --> 50:39.040
Yeah.

50:39.040 --> 50:39.600
Stream it over.

50:39.600 --> 50:41.760
It's just the use case is very limited.

50:41.760 --> 50:42.080
I think.

50:42.080 --> 50:45.360
I think that's kind of what it ended up being as much of like a neat piece of technology

50:45.360 --> 50:46.160
as it was.

50:46.160 --> 50:49.680
I think also it was kind of lacking in not, not everybody's going to agree with this,

50:49.680 --> 50:55.440
but I think they were really lacked in not having a Netflix app, a Hulu app, so it could

50:55.440 --> 50:59.200
compete on the level with like Roku boxes and stuff.

50:59.200 --> 51:02.720
So that way, if you were looking at Steam Link, it's like, oh, well, this one not only

51:02.720 --> 51:05.920
will do Netflix, Hulu, but this one will play all my PC games too.

51:05.920 --> 51:06.800
So this is the better value.

51:06.800 --> 51:07.360
Exactly.

51:07.360 --> 51:12.320
That would have been ideal, but it's like, it just like the whole Steam Box idea, it's

51:12.320 --> 51:16.080
kind of a half-baked idea and they just didn't really implement it too well.

51:16.080 --> 51:19.120
They kind of, they kind of stopped two thirds of the way, if you will.

51:20.720 --> 51:24.880
Looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com, VidPower says best thing about Steam Link is you can

51:24.880 --> 51:27.120
minimize it and use your PC on your TV.

51:27.120 --> 51:30.480
And Bobby Black Wolf says, yeah, I use Steam Link to watch streaming services that don't

51:30.480 --> 51:31.840
have a console app.

51:31.840 --> 51:36.160
Bobby Black Wolf also says, I think now they just want to get a Steam Link app on your

51:36.160 --> 51:36.640
Roku.

51:36.640 --> 51:37.920
And I think, I think he's right.

51:37.920 --> 51:41.040
I think that's where it's headed now because aren't there already televisions that have

51:41.040 --> 51:42.240
the Steam thing built in?

51:42.240 --> 51:45.520
Well, the Android TV has the Steam Link app.

51:45.520 --> 51:48.080
So I have that for my Android TV that I've got.

51:48.960 --> 51:52.240
I don't believe my Roku has a Steam Link app.

51:52.240 --> 51:52.480
Yeah.

51:52.480 --> 51:55.440
And just to be clear, like Bobby Black Wolf was saying, this is an example.

51:55.440 --> 51:58.080
The Steam wants to be, that is not, and just, yeah.

51:58.080 --> 51:59.920
Cause somebody in chat asked, oh, there's a Steam.

51:59.920 --> 52:00.960
No, not yet.

52:00.960 --> 52:02.720
But this is just kind of the progression.

52:02.720 --> 52:02.960
Yeah.

52:02.960 --> 52:05.360
Cause I think I would have looked at that.

52:05.360 --> 52:08.480
I would have put it on there if they had that, but no, they didn't have that.

52:08.480 --> 52:13.920
But hey, my TV that doesn't have, you know, Android TV that has a Steam Link app, I guess

52:13.920 --> 52:17.920
I could just hook my Steam Link up to that if I really wanted to.

52:17.920 --> 52:21.840
I don't though, cause I don't even know where it, no, I do know where it is.

52:21.840 --> 52:24.320
It's in the same place that my PlayStation TV is.

52:24.320 --> 52:26.480
You know what also ruined Steam Link for me?

52:27.040 --> 52:33.680
The game, the first game I tried to play on my TV was that Tron runner, Tron run R.

52:33.680 --> 52:34.480
That was the name of it.

52:34.480 --> 52:35.520
So you remember that game?

52:35.520 --> 52:35.760
Yeah.

52:35.760 --> 52:36.000
Okay.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.960
So the thing about that game level like four would freeze on my computer and I couldn't

52:40.960 --> 52:44.080
get past it because of some weird thing with my video card.

52:44.080 --> 52:48.080
So even when I was using the Steam Link, I could never get that part in the game.

52:48.080 --> 52:51.680
So it's like in my mind, you just kind of associate that mental thing.

52:52.240 --> 52:59.280
It's like, you know, if you, let's say eat at Taco Bell and it makes you really sick,

52:59.280 --> 53:02.320
you're probably not going to eat Taco Bell again for a long time.

53:02.320 --> 53:07.200
That's like the kind of response, the Pavlov's response that I got with my Steam Link is

53:07.200 --> 53:09.280
that Steam Link's just crashing my computer.

53:09.280 --> 53:11.920
Unless, you know, you do whether it's rational or not.

53:11.920 --> 53:12.800
That's what happened.

53:12.800 --> 53:17.360
I do where we haven't gone out to eat in a certain place in a long time.

53:17.360 --> 53:21.120
And so then we go back out there and we're like, oh yeah, that's why we don't come here

53:21.200 --> 53:21.680
anymore.

53:22.560 --> 53:26.640
And then you do that again a few years later because you forget why you stopped coming

53:26.640 --> 53:27.600
someplace.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.840
It's, yeah, I don't know.

53:31.440 --> 53:31.920
All right.

53:31.920 --> 53:32.800
So yeah.

53:32.800 --> 53:34.960
R.I.P. Steam Link, I guess.

53:34.960 --> 53:35.520
That's that.

53:36.480 --> 53:37.200
All right.

53:37.200 --> 53:42.320
Let's move on and talk about, this is, I think, kind of a big deal that came out the

53:42.320 --> 53:43.280
week we were off.

53:43.280 --> 53:45.840
And I was like, well, bummer we didn't have a show this weekend.

53:45.840 --> 53:47.120
So we'll talk about it now.

53:47.120 --> 53:50.720
I'm sure as many of you have heard by now, the announcement came out that Sony Interactive

53:50.720 --> 53:55.440
Entertainment will not be participating with E3 in the year 2019.

53:55.440 --> 53:58.000
So next year they will be skipping E3.

53:58.640 --> 54:03.120
In a statement that the company gave to Game Informer, they said, as the industry evolves,

54:03.120 --> 54:06.240
Sony Interactive Entertainment continues to look for inventive opportunities to engage

54:06.240 --> 54:07.040
the community.

54:07.040 --> 54:10.720
PlayStation fans mean the world to us, and we always want to innovate, think differently,

54:10.720 --> 54:12.960
and experiment with new ways to delight gamers.

54:12.960 --> 54:16.640
As a result, we have decided not to participate in E3 2019.

54:16.640 --> 54:21.680
We are exploring new and familiar ways to engage our community in 2019 and can't wait

54:21.680 --> 54:23.520
to share our plans with you.

54:23.520 --> 54:27.200
And so some people wondering, well, what does this mean for like, are they going to do what

54:27.200 --> 54:28.080
EA does?

54:28.080 --> 54:32.400
And EA doesn't participate in E3, but they're like across the street at the same time doing

54:32.400 --> 54:33.520
their own shit, right?

54:33.520 --> 54:38.000
Well, Sony clarified, Senior Vice President of Communications, Jennifer Clark said, we

54:38.000 --> 54:43.200
will not activate or hold a press conference around E3.

54:43.200 --> 54:48.320
So Sony, not going to be in LA in June.

54:48.320 --> 54:51.440
That was the perfect time to announce your next gen system, Microsoft.

54:52.320 --> 54:54.160
Which could very well happen.

54:55.040 --> 55:00.480
Just so you know, in a related story, I'm sure people were contacting right away, Nintendo

55:00.480 --> 55:02.960
and Microsoft were contacted right away about E3.

55:03.600 --> 55:06.160
Both have confirmed they will be at E3.

55:06.160 --> 55:12.480
Phil Spencer actually wrote a tweet, a lot to share with fans at E3 2019, always a high

55:12.480 --> 55:16.320
point of the year to witness the industry's creativity and the energy of the community.

55:16.320 --> 55:21.920
The official Xbox account saying, we can't wait to see you at E3 2019.

55:21.920 --> 55:26.320
Reggie Fils-Aime saying E3 is an outstanding opportunity for us to share new games and

55:26.320 --> 55:28.480
experiences with the fans and business partners from around the globe.

55:28.480 --> 55:30.160
And that's a statement that E3 actually put out.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.680
So those two companies will still be there.

55:31.680 --> 55:37.440
I think the thought, it seems like the general consensus is that Sony is just kind of resting

55:37.440 --> 55:41.120
high on their laurels and they're just like, yeah, we don't fucking need you guys.

55:41.200 --> 55:45.280
And so they're, I don't know if they have anything to show because I think it's more

55:45.280 --> 55:49.760
column B. I don't think it's necessarily Sony being crass, which is, you know, gamers

55:49.760 --> 55:53.840
oftentimes when a knee jerk reactor take it to a negative space because I think that's

55:53.840 --> 55:58.320
the reality is that Sony doesn't have anything they really, or, or the stuff they're going

55:58.320 --> 56:02.320
to show is the stuff they've already shown and they're going to get read for it because

56:02.320 --> 56:04.320
Last of Us 2 still isn't out.

56:04.320 --> 56:05.760
And I don't, have they dated that yet?

56:06.320 --> 56:08.240
This is probably next holiday.

56:08.240 --> 56:11.120
So yeah, Last of Us 2, they're still Death Stranding.

56:11.680 --> 56:13.120
Death Stranding is probably the next holiday.

56:13.120 --> 56:14.800
Zombie game that they're supposed to be coming.

56:14.800 --> 56:16.080
Days Gone or is that what it is?

56:16.080 --> 56:16.400
Days Gone.

56:16.400 --> 56:18.720
I think they did Days Gone finally because it got pushed back.

56:19.360 --> 56:21.520
The Samurai game that they had coming.

56:21.520 --> 56:25.760
So I kind of think if they were to have E3, they'd probably be rehashing a bit.

56:25.760 --> 56:28.320
I mean, maybe that Final Fantasy 7 remake someday.

56:28.320 --> 56:29.120
I don't know.

56:29.120 --> 56:33.840
So, uh, I think I can sort of see that maybe Sony's just like, you know, we don't have

56:33.840 --> 56:37.520
a lot to show this year because we're setting up for the next year.

56:37.520 --> 56:40.160
But there is that, I'm going to be honest.

56:40.160 --> 56:42.000
There's that cynical side of me as well too.

56:42.000 --> 56:46.000
That's like, I don't think it's so much Sony being on a high horse, but I seem to

56:46.000 --> 56:51.360
remember after we all remember the infamous E3 when the PlayStation 3 was unveiled.

56:51.360 --> 56:54.640
Giant enemy crabs, $599 US dollars, right?

56:54.640 --> 56:57.440
All those sound bites that came back to haunt Sony.

56:57.440 --> 57:00.720
I seem to remember Sony threatened to pull out that year too.

57:02.320 --> 57:04.160
They didn't, but they almost did.

57:04.800 --> 57:11.040
And I seem to recall this last year wasn't like superbly well received at the press

57:11.040 --> 57:12.320
conference at Sony.

57:12.320 --> 57:16.560
I mean, no, cause it wasn't, it wasn't like the games weren't like a problem or anything.

57:16.560 --> 57:19.600
I think people were generally excited about like Spider-Man stuff, but I think people

57:19.600 --> 57:24.560
were just like, Oh, why are we standing in this barn and then going to this thing?

57:24.560 --> 57:27.120
And it got like a lot of like crap online.

57:27.120 --> 57:34.480
And so I think honestly, somebody, honestly, Loki, you, me, Jamie, Bobby Black Wolf, we

57:34.480 --> 57:39.200
all sat down four years ago or so and kind of asked ourselves, is it really worth it

57:39.200 --> 57:40.720
for us to go to E3 anymore?

57:40.720 --> 57:42.880
Are we getting value out of E3 anymore?

57:42.880 --> 57:47.440
And honestly, somebody at Sony in a boardroom probably asked that same question.

57:47.440 --> 57:51.280
Like we paid all this money for this to get this online.

57:51.280 --> 57:52.480
Why are we doing E3?

57:53.040 --> 57:55.280
I think somebody asked that very hard question.

57:55.280 --> 58:01.760
But then again, like you're the one that made the choice to hold your little video

58:01.760 --> 58:04.560
thing in a barn with like a musical guest and stuff.

58:04.560 --> 58:05.360
And yes, I get it.

58:05.360 --> 58:08.000
The guy is like, he's good.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.880
He's a good musical guest, but is it really necessary to do that?

58:12.880 --> 58:14.640
Couldn't you just show a trailer and be done with it?

58:14.640 --> 58:17.200
I mean, like who, I don't know.

58:17.200 --> 58:17.920
I just think it.

58:19.280 --> 58:20.800
Let me get to some of the comments in our chat.

58:21.680 --> 58:22.880
Live.vognetwork.com.

58:22.880 --> 58:27.520
SSG100Matt says, I think Sony's recent moves decision not to do a PlayStation experience

58:27.520 --> 58:27.760
show.

58:27.760 --> 58:28.960
Remember, that's a thing too.

58:28.960 --> 58:32.640
And skipping E3 seemed to indicate that they're going to go all out in 2020.

58:32.640 --> 58:36.480
Sony cited that they don't have enough console exclusive and things in development not announced

58:36.480 --> 58:38.640
to warrant doing either show entirely.

58:38.640 --> 58:43.120
This leads me to believe they are going to rely on major game ports, the handful of games

58:43.120 --> 58:46.640
they are releasing in 2019, and even the PlayStation 1 classic.

58:46.640 --> 58:48.080
And let's not forget third party.

58:48.640 --> 58:50.720
Third party is hugely important in that too.

58:50.720 --> 58:52.080
That PlayStation 1 classic.

58:52.080 --> 58:54.640
I have very low expectations for that.

58:54.640 --> 58:55.140
Yeah.

58:56.320 --> 58:56.960
Let's see.

58:56.960 --> 58:58.720
Also, comments in chat.

58:59.600 --> 59:03.840
Yyr in chat says, remember the last one to two years of the 360.

59:03.840 --> 59:05.520
Microsoft had nothing.

59:05.520 --> 59:08.320
PlayStation 3 delivered and caught up.

59:08.320 --> 59:10.480
I wonder if the opposite might happen now.

59:11.120 --> 59:12.320
Slightly different dynamic.

59:12.320 --> 59:15.760
Yyr to PlayStation 3, and I'm using my quotey fingers, catching up.

59:15.760 --> 59:20.000
PlayStation always kind of had the advantage in Japan too, which Microsoft, even with the

59:20.000 --> 59:22.080
360, was never really able to do.

59:22.080 --> 59:27.200
And I don't really see them breaking through that Japan wall with Xbox One either.

59:27.760 --> 59:33.120
Potentially their next system, again, I think the biggest bombshell in the world would be

59:33.120 --> 59:38.240
Microsoft announcing they've acquired a Japanese studio amongst all these studio acquisitions

59:38.240 --> 59:38.880
they're doing.

59:38.880 --> 59:39.920
But we're all waiting on that.

59:39.920 --> 59:42.000
Maybe that'll be the bombshell they drop next E3.

59:42.000 --> 59:42.480
I don't know.

59:42.480 --> 59:43.760
I'm fan wanking.

59:43.760 --> 59:44.720
I'm making shit up.

59:45.360 --> 59:49.760
But I mean, that would really turn heads that if Microsoft is going to put some more focus

59:49.760 --> 59:50.720
back on Japan.

59:50.720 --> 59:53.520
But certainly Microsoft could certainly use this opportunity.

59:53.520 --> 59:54.480
Absolutely.

59:54.480 --> 01:00:02.880
But, you know, Sony is probably loading the guns with exclusives for the inevitable PlayStation

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.440
5.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.880
That seems more and more likely for 2020 as whatever Microsoft is probably doing next

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:14.160
is probably 2020 unless, I don't know, they did kind of tease it a little bit at this

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:14.480
last year.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.920
Maybe they are going to do it in 2019.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.480
Maybe they're going to try to get a year jump on it like they did with the 360.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:24.080
They may not announce it at E3 because Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were not unveiled at

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:24.480
E3.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.760
They were done at separate events.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.600
So who knows?

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.560
So many things could happen.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:34.720
But what we do know, Microsoft is starting, they're moving the chess pieces, right?

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.880
They have acquired all of these studios.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.600
Why?

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.880
Exclusives.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.680
What?

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.200
Next Xbox.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:45.040
So I fully expect that next Xbox gets announced.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.080
And I think probably in 2020 to give these games time to cook and so forth so that they

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.240
can say we've got this exclusive, this exclusive, this exclusive, this exclusive.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.400
And don't worry, Crackdown is coming out in 2020 next year.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.560
Right around the corner.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.680
But Sony, I think, is in a position where they're positioning themselves for a similar

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.160
thing.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.640
They're basically taking an entire year off and relying on third parties, relying on indies

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:21.200
and that stuff so that they can also navigate and get lined up for 2020 and have this, this,

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.480
and this ready to go in response to what Microsoft's going to do.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.640
2020 is going to be an exciting year.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:31.360
You know, honestly, in my opinion, Microsoft's not the one that stands to gain from this

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:31.600
scenario.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.360
You know who's really going to gain from this scenario?

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:37.520
Everybody's favorite number two, Nintendo.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:38.800
Nintendo.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:42.800
Nintendo is going to be clean, clean slate next year.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.400
They could, they're going to put out the new Animal Crossing game.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.280
Probably Metroid Prime 4 happens next year.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.280
If they wanted to redo the Switch and do a Super Switch or a Switch XL, whatever the

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.440
fuck they want to do, next year's the year to do it.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.680
Like Nintendo has a clear path next year.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:03.360
It'll be very interesting to see what they do with it since they don't compete with Microsoft

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.480
and Sony after all.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.320
So next year's all them.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.680
Well, I shouldn't say that because, you know, we will have Death Stranding.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.920
Last of Us 2, I'm sure is going to be amazing.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.840
Microsoft, it's not like they're taking the year off.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:14.640
They have their own stuff.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.800
Yeah, they don't compete unless they're winning.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.120
Yeah, that's like, that's like my kids.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.440
Like, well, I wasn't racing anyway, so it doesn't matter that I came in second.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.280
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure they're like, oh yeah, we're not competing with those guys when they're

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.000
down in the numbers.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
But then like, oh yeah, our console is the most number, you know, it sold the most units

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:34.800
out of all of them.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.000
We're great.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.200
But we're not competing.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:43.440
YYR in chat says, yeah, Xbox One isn't catching all the way up, but they can build momentum

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.560
for the next generation.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.600
I think that's a very interesting way to look at it, momentum.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:51.760
And I'll be very curious to see what Sony does to kind of bridge the gap.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.680
Are they going to go the Nintendo route and do more directs?

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.120
Like, obviously, Sony doesn't do a direct, but you know what I mean?

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:05.680
Like, you know, when they did their E3 thing this last time, they had the press

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:08.880
conferences happening in the barn and that stadium thing.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.920
What did they fill in the interim with during E3?

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.240
Their team that does all that, their blog cast people that do all the online content.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.480
So what's to say these guys don't put together little special TV shows and, you know, online

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.080
TV shows and things that are akin to Nintendo's directs?

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.840
And that's how Sony puts news out in the next year.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:29.620
Who knows?

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:31.600
So we'll see.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.600
Next year is going to be very interesting for momentum.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:38.640
Let me ask one more question for everybody.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:44.080
Let's take the focus off Sony a little bit and let's put the focus on E3 itself.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.000
Is E3 dead?

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.560
Does this just prove that E3 is dead?

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.160
Yes or no?

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.640
Support your E3 hasn't really necessarily been E3 for a few years now.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.280
So elaborate, please.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.520
It just kind of morphing into its own thing because, you know, this is like its final

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.720
or one of the pieces to transition back into E4 all type of things.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.920
Oh, that's damn you.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.040
Because that's exactly where I was going.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.520
It's like now we're going to get the show that E4 all was supposed to be.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.960
E3 has been slowly morphing into the show that E4 all was supposed to be.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.640
But now no one's going to care because E4 all is just basically PAX, but PAX is better.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:28.720
So, you know, well, but is PAX better than what E3 is going to put out?

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.080
Let's analyze that for a moment.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.920
If E3 now views its competition as PAX, which I'm not necessarily saying is true,

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.480
I realize E3 is still a trade show.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.440
PAX is still a fan.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.480
She's got a Gamescom.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.960
But one of your biggest fucking trade companies just backed out of the show.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:50.800
So would E3 be smarter to reposition itself and embrace this fan thing

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.440
more than they've already been doing in the past couple of years?

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:58.560
You know, maybe E3 the trade show is is dying.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.400
We'll say that I won't say the finality of is dead, but is dying.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.760
E3 the fan show is growing.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:08.720
You know, obviously they're not going to bring that name E4 all back

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.440
because everybody's going to associate that with a conference that didn't work.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:16.080
But I mean, a lot of those same kind of things that E4 all was going for.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.520
Isn't that kind of what E3 is like slowly turning into away from a trade show

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.200
and competing with something like PAX?

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.360
And I'm sorry, but PAX hasn't been good since 2010, in my opinion.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.960
So is it better than PAX?

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.240
Maybe.

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.960
I don't know, but I just I don't know.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:38.400
It's I don't have any like like I never feel like even nowadays, like,

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:43.120
oh, man, I really wish I'd gone to E3 this year.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.560
I don't feel that at all anymore.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:49.360
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I like how video games are one of the only industries

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.360
where the consumers won't allow an industry trade show to exist

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.440
without them being a part of it.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.720
Do movies do this, too?

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.440
Does movies?

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.400
No, I guess.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:02.640
I mean, I feel like in a way, because all of it shows up on the Internet, but maybe not.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:05.760
Well, movies, I don't even know if they have really any trade shows, perhaps.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.480
Cinema West or whatever that thing's called.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.520
I don't where they show all the new trailers.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.120
It was in Vegas this past year.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.160
I feel like there's a couple.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.440
But yeah, I get I don't know.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:19.120
But like, I know there's like a lot of stuff takes place during like comic cons nowadays.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:19.680
It seems like.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.880
Vidpower in chat says, E3's brand name is still important,

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.760
as non-gamers only know of E3 and probably don't know of other gaming conventions like PAX.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:31.680
Interesting.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.840
The name recognition.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:37.040
E3 is the type of thing that tends to get covered in newspapers

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:42.400
on news channels for general people, not just necessarily a gamer audience.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.120
Dartitsuya in chat says, does D23 count?

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.280
Though that's Disney exclusively, I think.

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:51.840
Well, but think of all the things Disney's been snapping up lately.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.280
Disney's Marvel now.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.280
So that is included in D23.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.720
Disney Star Wars.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.760
The latest Star Wars trailers show up at D23.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:01.440
Disney is ABC.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:09.520
So yes, D23 is Disney, but Disney is much more than just cartoons and Disneyland at this point.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.200
Disney is a big empire.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:16.800
So Bobby Blackwell says, I think the thing that caused E3 to decline

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.880
was making it not just a trade show.

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:25.760
I think in a way, yes, but I think with virtual conferencing and virtual technology being

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.600
bigger and bigger and the fact that we do get more of our stuff across the internet and that,

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:32.080
you know, YouTube's deliver all the same information.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.760
We're doing conferences across video and working from home and all this stuff that

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.480
we didn't do 10 years ago nearly as much.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.400
I kind of think that all plays into it.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.360
I think a lot of trade happens virtually.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.280
Like you just don't have to take a trip out to LA anymore to see stuff.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:47.920
That's the thing.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:50.800
Anyway.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.840
All right, let's move on or we can probably spend a whole three hours on this topic,

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.120
but we do have other things we want to cover.

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:55.920
So let's move on.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.420
Loki.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:02.400
So No Man's Sky rolled out with another patch over the last week here.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:08.640
So they have this new free patch called Visions and it added some new stuff to the game,

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.200
including new biomes.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:18.320
It had some creatures in outer space, more palette variety in the planets.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.800
They had new fauna in the game.

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.640
Lots of new tweaks that make kind of the game look better.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.040
New base parts.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.680
And I really need to go back to this game, but it's free and it's continuing to update,

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.680
making the game even better than it was before,

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:39.440
which we could say the same about Fallout 76,

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:43.280
but maybe that will follow in the same path and, you know.

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:44.240
You know what, despite-

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.840
50 gigabyte update at a time.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:49.920
Despite all the shit that Hello Games has got over the years for No Man's Sky,

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.040
like you got to hand it to them that they are still pouring in the effort

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.760
to continue to improve and evolve this game.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.240
It's pretty bad.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.040
I feel less bad about them doing it because,

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:02.480
or like the situation with them because they had a smaller team

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.400
buying it, whereas Bethesda was like,

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.720
you know, hey, we got our Fallout team and we got some mid team

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.640
and we got these other guys doing it.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.920
We have these other guys doing it.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.560
We have all these people from Bethesda like putting it together.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.480
It's like, this is what you came up with.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:17.600
And I think I think you're right.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.960
A lot of people have said that some of these issues with No Man's Sky

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.680
and what the internet made it out to be was that you had a,

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:28.720
you know, indie developer being treated like a very ambitious idea,

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:34.080
whereas multiplayer Fallout 4 recycled, not so ambitious.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:34.580
Yeah.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:36.960
But hey, check it out.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.280
It's free if you have the game.

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:41.120
So why not?

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:41.620
Why not?

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.520
And I bet a lot of people probably pick that up on sale at some point or something.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.160
So, oh, yeah.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:46.660
Yes.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.560
They sell the fall sale and hey, tomorrow is Cyber Monday.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.120
Did you get suckered into buying anything from any of these Black Friday,

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.440
Cyber Monday sales, Steam sales going on?

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.640
Nintendo had a big sale.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.320
I was tempted to buy games on the Switch for my kids,

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.360
but I can't really all of them were digital.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.640
So I don't really want to do that because I need to give it to them for Christmas.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.480
And I just haven't been able to order that stuff.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:11.760
I'm waiting till tomorrow.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:14.400
Let's see what I can pick up for them because they want to get like,

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.480
you know, all the popular game.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:16.880
Oh, my God.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:21.120
So like speaking of sort of video games, I went and saw Wreck-It Ralph 2 this weekend.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:21.840
Oh, how was that?

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.320
I want to go see it.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.200
It was fantastic.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.240
Oh, I can't wait.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:24.880
So it's great.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.640
They have a game in the you saw them trailer called Slaughter Race,

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.760
which is basically Grand Theft Auto, which is fantastic.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.400
But there's like they're talking about like, you know, this YouTube type of thing,

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.680
you know, that they're trying to get him lots of views and likes and stuff

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:45.760
so that he gets money to order this part or whatever.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.160
And so they're talking about like the different things that are popular and stuff.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.360
And of course, there is like literally a two second clip of Fortnite

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.480
and all the fucking kids in the entire theater, including my own son.

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:58.240
It's like, oh, my God, Fortnite.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.920
You know, it's just it's like, oh, my God, did you say Fortnite?

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.560
Oh, my God.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.440
And so it's the game of the week.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:10.480
But like so, yeah, he wants like stuff, you know, like they want to get Hello Neighbor,

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.160
which is, you know, the popular like kind of, you know, not babies first,

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.800
but kids first horror game.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.840
Babies first horror game.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.080
I thought it was like Five Nights at Freddy's

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.440
because those games aren't really violent.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:25.920
That too.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.320
And like he's wanted me to give him Five Nights at Freddy's.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.240
And I'm like, you know, Custom Night's free.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:34.080
You just play that for free in Bendy and the Ink Machine.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:39.040
You know, it's also another horror game very much in the horror games.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:40.960
And of course, Roblox.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.840
He wants me to give him some like in-game currency for that game.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.480
Oh, boy.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.680
They have so much garbage on there.

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:48.720
But oh, my God, it's all all the time.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.960
But yeah, my no, my youngest son, my like four year old wants Hello Neighbor.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.520
I don't even know that game.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:55.920
That's funny.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.640
Hello Neighbor.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.280
It's about I don't even know necessarily the premise of the game.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.640
I know that you basically break into this guy's house next door.

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.600
And I think you should teach.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.760
And it's like this giant weird house.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.480
You just find out what's like going on over there.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:11.120
Like I don't know if he's murdering kids or something, but like something.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:11.440
What?

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.480
Don't buy that for children.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.520
It's an E10 game.

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.000
It's fine.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.920
It's he's probably not actually murdering kids.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.080
Or if it's, you know, it's not super violent.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.200
It's just ketchup.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:20.000
It's E10.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.120
But like apparently you're trying to like sneeze and he sets traps and stuff like that.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.520
And so I don't know what the premise is.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.880
It's just teaching you about burglarizing people's houses, I guess.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:31.520
Interesting.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:33.280
Yeah.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.880
So that and then they have like the Leo games.

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.560
Sia Tabiri says kidnapping.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.720
Hello Neighbor is giant puzzle stealth.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:41.280
Bobby Black Wolf suggests Night Trap for babies.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.240
Night Trap for babies.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:45.600
Night twap.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:53.200
All right.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.040
I hate it.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:55.360
All right.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:55.920
Let's move on.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.120
So we were talking about big developers, big teams, developing things.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.680
Still chatter about Diablo and the mess that happened.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:06.160
Oh yeah.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.840
Oh, still angry.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.440
Still stuff about this.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:14.160
Not so much about Diablo Immortal at this point, but talk about people coming out of the woodwork.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.320
You know, anonymous tipsters and things like that.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:21.520
Talking about Diablo 4 that's been in development and what it is.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.600
And apparently part of the reason why they weren't ready to announce it yet is that the game has gone

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:26.800
through some changes.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:32.080
Apparently the first version of Diablo, according to reports online, Kotaku did this whole,

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.200
you know, expose on it.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.680
And I think other websites are kind of piggybacked on it.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.680
Apparently there was a Diablo project under work.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.800
It was called Hades.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:45.440
It was basically Blizzard's version of Dark Souls, but it was in the Diablo universe.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:51.280
It was a mainline Diablo project that was headed up by Josh Mosquera, who did Diablo 3

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.920
Reaper of Souls, who has since left Blizzard.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.840
Although obviously they never talk about why.

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.600
Did he do it to go do a new company?

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.560
Did he do it because of this?

01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.280
I don't know.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:03.680
But anyway, it would have been, they say, a Gothic challenging dungeon crawler.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.000
It was Diablo's take on Dark Souls.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.080
Apparently this was going to be an over the shoulder third person perspective.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.360
They may not have ended up calling it Diablo 4.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.320
It was so different.

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.880
But that's kind of where it started as.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:22.320
As a Diablo fan, I think this sounds terrible, but I bet my husband would be super into it

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:25.840
because he loves Dark Souls and he also has played a lot of Diablo 3.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.840
So this is probably up his alley, but I'm all about loot, loot, loot, loot, loot.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.680
I don't care about like super hard mode, but that's what I, maybe it wasn't that.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:37.520
I mean, we hear Dark Souls and that's a certain type of, oh, you died, you died, you died.

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:38.080
Right.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.880
And maybe Blizzard was not going to really do it that same way.

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.600
What is it with Activision and trying to copy everybody?

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.480
I mean, like I understand this is Blizzard, but it's still Activision.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:51.360
And it's like you have a game formula that Blizzard is fucking good at it.

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.000
Look at what they did with Overwatch, Team Fortress 2.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:54.480
Look what they do.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.920
The Heroes of the Storm, League of Legends.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:56.960
Look what they did with that.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:57.920
They do it.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.840
They don't bring it to you every time, Loki.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.680
Yeah, but look what they did with Diablo.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.240
Diablo 3 is great now.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.320
Okay, but that's, that's a whole nother reason.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:16.080
That, that is a game made for China that should have never been on the main stage at Blizzcon.

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.200
We talked about this a couple of weeks ago.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.160
It was the messaging.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.720
If the messaging had been different on that game, nobody would give a shit.

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:27.280
The problem was it was the big announcement at a convention people paid $150 to go to.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.640
They should have kept it a sideshow and they should have let the Warcraft 3 remaster have

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.280
the spotlight.

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.360
It would have been fine.

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.080
But anyway, we already talked about that.

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.600
So, uh, let's see.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.080
Uh, this, uh, was canceled.

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.720
Apparently there was also a planned second expansion for Diablo 3 that was canceled.

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.920
And that pisses me off because that game deserved a second expansion.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.720
Uh, I would love to see what they, I feel like now, now the necromancer thing feels

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:56.080
even more half-assed knowing that there was supposed to be a second expansion at some

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:56.480
point.

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.040
Well, that's okay.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:00.160
The second expansion will just be a part of like pre-ordered DLC.

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.520
Well, there is no second expansion now.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.320
I mean, it'll be just rolled into whatever next game it is.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.040
Yeah.

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.120
So anyway, apparently there is still a Diablo project that's in the works.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:13.040
It's being headed up by what's left of the Diablo 3 team, team three.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.920
Uh, and it's going to be another mainline entry in the series.

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:20.800
Uh, but it's still very early on and even the camera perspective may still change to

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.680
what they had on this, uh, project Hades.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.880
So, uh, Diablo 4 still a long ways out.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:33.840
And that is ultimately probably why Blizzard chose not to even show us a logo at this time

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.400
and make the decisions they did.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.360
I would love to know why the second expansion got canceled.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.760
That's the, that's the answer I want.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.480
Why did Diablo 3 second expansion get canceled?

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.920
And that's, that's not really me.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:50.400
Cause it sounds like people inside Blizzard were very surprised to hear it was canceled

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.280
as well.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.280
So, interesting.

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.680
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade at vognetwork.com,

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:01.440
use the passphrase TWIG.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.760
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:06.960
We have just a couple more stories before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:07.760
Loki.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:12.560
So there's been rumors that there's going to be a new version of the Switch coming out

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:13.760
at some point soon.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:20.480
And now that's kind of backed up a little bit by this consumer service video that Nintendo

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:25.040
has put out called how to prepare a Nintendo Switch for trade in or sale.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:31.040
So basically telling you how you are supposed to like, you know, back up your data to the

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:31.440
cloud.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:35.440
Of course, if you're a Switch online user and do a system transfer, link your accounts

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:39.360
and then erase your data and then also unlink in your account.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:42.800
If you forget to delete anything before trading in.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.560
I'm sure they're going to say, well, it's because, you know, we're talking about, you

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:49.520
know, trading in.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:56.080
If you want one of the Pikachu versions, the Diablo 3 Switch and their Smash Brothers one

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.240
too, Smash Brothers or something like that.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.400
But like, I don't know.

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.880
I don't see people doing that necessarily like they would.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:03.840
Oh, maybe Shane.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.840
But most people would not do that.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.880
It's a lot more money than like a 3DS, you know, or 2DS.

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:11.520
Yeah.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.720
Or DS.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:15.440
Can't you just get stickers to put back on the existing Switch?

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.080
You can.

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.000
You can get like just skins and stuff.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:18.800
Who gives a shit?

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.320
It's just a fucking skin.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.600
No one cares.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.800
It's a collectible.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:28.720
I mean, some people, my mother loved to collect these goblets from the Madonna Inn in San

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.280
Elizabeth, the Madonna Inn with the themed rooms and all that stuff.

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.680
For some reason, she loved these goblets.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:37.280
She collected the goblets and we just like, they're, they're, they're just drink cups.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.120
I mean, they're really pretty, but that's it.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:39.840
You know what?

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.800
People collect things that they like collectors.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.560
But the thought more, you know, the thought process is, well, maybe it's getting ready

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:51.120
for people to trade in their system for a newer Switch version or something.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:55.200
So maybe that's going to be a thing, but I guess we'll have to wait and see because they

01:18:55.200 --> 01:19:00.080
haven't announced anything, but it seems to be, that's kind of the rumors kind of going

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:00.480
that way.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.920
How would you feel if they did do a switch?

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.240
I still feel like it's too early for one.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:08.160
I'm only going to support it if they don't start locking shit out like they did with

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.200
the new 3DS.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.640
I'm going to be pissed if there's a Switch upgrade that suddenly starts locking things

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.480
out because it's only been like two years.

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:18.560
It's too soon for us to get a new console that's like, Oh, it's got all these exclusives

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:18.800
on it.

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:19.200
Don't worry.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.000
We're not going to do that.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.120
And then we do that, you know?

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:21.440
Yeah.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:21.680
Right.

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:22.960
That's what I'm.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.280
I just don't understand what they, what they would be.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.880
I mean, I guess upgrade the screen.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.000
The screen's fine.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
It looks nice on the 720 screen.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.640
I mean, I don't think we really need to increase the resolution or anything.

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.360
Battery life.

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:34.720
Is that an issue?

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:41.920
More power, more graphical oomph, more chips, more rams, more memories, more on board storage.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.240
That would be nice because 32 gigs is ridiculous.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.800
But I don't really see, I don't know.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.160
I don't think it's necessary.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:51.600
Well, we'll see.

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.360
Nintendo's just got to tell us.

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.120
I would like another switch just so I have one that the kids don't fuck up.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:02.480
I forgot to mention, so here's what I do now because they have fucked up, you know, my

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.400
red and blue, um, joy con.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.600
So I have a set of, you know, uh, Splatoon ones.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.760
I have the green and purple or not green, purple, green and pink.

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:15.680
And so I have those sitting, um, charging all the time.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:19.680
And then when I go and play the system, I just take the crappy joy cons off and I put

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:24.160
the nice untouched joy cons on there and I play my games with that.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:28.400
And then of course it put the crappy ones back on when the kids play it because I don't

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:31.840
know what the fuck they did to that analog sick, but it's fucked.

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:37.600
It is all sorts of like, I don't know, maybe if there's like crap or like dust or something

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:42.480
underneath it, but it drifts like I tried fixing that thing, but it's drifting all over

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.200
the fucking place.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.520
They threw it in the bathtub when you weren't looking and throw it in the bathtub.

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:50.880
But it's, I, I think if it's, I think it may be dust, but I don't understand how that

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.560
thing would be affected by dust so quickly.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.000
We've only had it since April.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.560
I mean, it's not been that long and it's only the left sick for some reason.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.800
And I've tried like cleaning it out, like blowing children a blessing.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.240
I don't even know if it's children.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:07.520
It's, I've seen people complain online that these things break pretty fast.

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:07.840
Oh yeah.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:10.480
Dark to see in chat says my joy con is doing that too.

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:14.800
So it's just some shit on however they design it, you know, cheaply or whatever.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.600
So I don't know.

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:16.480
All right.

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:16.880
We'll see.

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:17.760
All right.

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:21.520
Well, before we get to the classic game of the week, uh, one way that, uh, you know,

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:25.840
people are getting in trouble for getting their classic games out is by running ROM

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:26.640
websites.

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:32.160
And, uh, yeah, while we were out, uh, you may remember Nintendo had filed actual lawsuits

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:35.840
against the websites, love ROMs and love retro.

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:41.040
Well, apparently they've reached an agreement and there is a $12 million judgment.

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:44.880
Love ROM and love retro will be paying Nintendo a $12 million judgment.

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.040
How do you, how do you, how do they have $12 million?

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.520
Does that just mean like their paychecks are going to be garnished for the rest of their

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:49.760
lives?

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.680
Cause where are they going to come up with $12 million?

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.480
Like where, where do you like Loki?

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.760
If you got sued for $12 million, how would you pay bankruptcy?

01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.440
I guess maybe that's what they plan to do.

01:21:59.440 --> 01:21:59.840
I don't know.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:04.080
I mean, you hopefully, hopefully if they're running your website like that, they had it

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:09.920
running under a LLC or something like that so that they're not liable for damages.

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:13.840
I don't think so because the defendants in this admit that their involvement with the

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.800
websites constituted direct and indirect copyright and trademark infringement, which caused Nintendo

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.440
irreparable injury plaintiff is hereby awarded judgment against all defendants jointly and

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:27.120
severally in the amount of $12 million, $230,000.

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:27.600
I am sorry.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.720
It's actually 12.2 million.

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:36.320
Oh, speaking of lawsuits, I got my $10 check from the whole PlayStation three, um, other

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.520
OS lawsuit.

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:38.080
Oh, nice.

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:38.560
Yeah.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.200
Oh, cool.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:39.520
Yeah.

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.800
I forgot that was even coming.

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.080
I ain't even like Merry Christmas.

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:44.320
Yeah.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.680
It's like $10.

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.200
I'll spend this in one place.

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:49.760
Also interesting.

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:55.200
They were required to sign over the ownership of love ROMs and love retro to Nintendo.

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:58.320
So wouldn't that be hilarious if Nintendo started using the love retro name?

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.360
We own this now.

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:06.000
Please give it up for our love retro collection coming up.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.600
That would be such an asshole thing to do, but I could see it happening.

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:10.160
That's great.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.520
That is a pretty good name to have love retro.

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:14.240
So who knows?

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.800
Just have love retro.com.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.360
Redirect to a website on switch online.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:23.360
Piracy is bad and stuff like that, but $12 million damage, please.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.440
I think that's a bit much.

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:26.800
All right.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:33.120
Also, Hey, if you are downloading ROMs, especially of the new stuff, be careful because, uh,

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.640
Pokemon let's go.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.400
I mean, there is a ROM out there floating around on the internet, but, uh, there's a

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:43.520
fake one, a Pokemon let's go Pikachu ROM that will brick your console.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:48.000
If you try to use it, it is a more sinister version of the game, which you shouldn't be

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.840
pirating the new stuff anyway.

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:54.800
So, you know, I probably really shouldn't even say this, but it is interesting that

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:58.080
people are kind of coming up with these kind of countermeasures to some of the pirates.

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:03.440
So Pokemon let's go Pikachu uses brick break and it was very, very effective.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:10.880
I can make those Pokemon now because I played the game.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:12.880
I'm aware of all this stuff.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:21.440
Let's go back to a more classic time when the, the Pokemon that we sought out was missing.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.960
No, we're going to take a step back with the classic game of the week.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:32.480
And so as usual, we take a trip down memory lane and through radio magic and the use of

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:36.560
Skype to say hello to dark Sakura or Jamie Summers with us on the line.

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.280
Hello, Jamie.

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.120
Hello.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.080
How are you doing?

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.400
I am okay.

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.120
How are you?

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:43.440
Good.

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.360
I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving.

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:47.360
It was pretty good.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.480
It was nice and chill, which is what I was hoping for.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:50.720
All right.

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.520
But literally chill because you guys are up in Tahoe, right?

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.320
Yes, it was snowing.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.120
There was snow on the beach, which was actually kind of weird for me, but very cool.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.720
Snow in California.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:03.840
Get out.

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.560
We have high elevation here.

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:06.880
It does.

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.320
It has been known to happen anyway.

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.800
It's the classic game of the week time.

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:16.080
Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and says, Hey, this game, you should

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.120
be thankful for this.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:23.280
Dark Sakura picked a, this is an interesting one because it's like, it's a modern take

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:28.480
on a classic game, but it does qualify under the 10 years or older criteria, believe it

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:29.040
or not, right?

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.880
That it does.

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:33.760
Cause it came out in September of 2008.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:34.160
There it is.

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:37.280
So it's a, this is one of those feel old yet type of games.

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.800
Cause it is 10 years old this year.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.000
What is the classic game of the week?

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.080
Mega Man nine.

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:48.800
Mega Man nine.

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:54.080
They were using chip tunes and Mega Man nine, but this was on the 360 and the Wii.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:55.920
Yep.

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.200
There's more to this.

01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:57.920
Okay.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:08.960
So, um, it was developed by Capcom and NTCreates and it is the first original Mega Man series

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:14.960
game since Mega Man eight and Mega Man and base or Rockman and Forte, uh, that came out

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.400
about a decade before this one.

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:23.840
Um, it is also the first game in the series to not have a truly physical first release.

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:31.360
Um, it was downloadable using, uh, WiiWare and PlayStation network and Xbox five arcade.

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:39.600
It was now since 2017 that it would have a physical release with the release of Mega

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:44.880
Man legacy, legacy collection two for PS4, Xbox one and PC and the digital version that

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.400
came out on the switch in 2018 in may.

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:54.480
So basically it continues the adventures of, uh, Mega Man or Rockman.

01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:00.720
And so Dr. Light is blamed for Dr. Wily's, uh, evil.

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:09.360
And so Mega Man goes into stop the robots to prove his creator's innocence and to show

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.760
that it's Wily who's a bad guy.

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.240
So it is old school 2D platforming Mega Man action.

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:24.880
Um, it was developed for modern console, but was required to go in an 8-bit and a visual

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:30.320
and audio style like the NES, uh, Inafune Kenji, uh, Keiji, sorry.

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:36.880
And, um, Takeshita, um, Hironobu who were the development team, um, you know, behind

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:42.320
those, uh, well, they were the producers, but they instructed the development team to

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.760
stick to the likeness and style of Mega Man 2.

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:53.040
Which came on 1988 and it was a pretty big success and it prompted them to also come

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.440
out with Mega Man 10, uh, soon after.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:01.760
So this was also something that took place in year 20XX.

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:08.480
And it is also the first game that create, that had a female robot master.

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:10.880
This was the game that Flash Woman showed up in.

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:17.440
Um, and of course in the robot order that you're supposed to fight in, you know, the

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:20.320
advised robot order, he's the first on the list.

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.480
So guess who happened to see them?

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:23.120
It's versatile.

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:34.960
Um, as I was saying, it did follow the style visually and audio for, um, Mega Man 2, um,

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.960
that was used as the benchmark for it.

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:42.240
It also did have downloadable content for the game that one of them would allow you

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:47.280
to play as Proto Man, which he can slide, charge his blaster and take double the damage

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.160
of Mega Man.

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:56.320
Um, you also could get higher difficulty and endless stage and, um, a new special box called

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:56.880
Fake Man.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:05.760
So, um, in, uh, the later release came out in Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, instead of

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:10.720
it being DLC, you had secret codes that will allow you to unlock the DLC content.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.920
Um, uh, as I said, it was developed by Capcom and Inti Creates.

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:25.200
Inti Creates had developed, uh, Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX, um, spin-offs and had previous

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:28.480
Capcom team members who had worked on other Mega Man games.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:34.800
Um, the first, uh, six games in the original Mega Man series were made for NES.

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:41.120
There were a bunch of spin-offs, of course, like Mega Man 8, and then the Mega Man, uh,

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:46.480
8 and Rockman 4K were, uh, brought out on other home consoles later.

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:54.240
But, you know, Hunie, um, was, of course, um, down to create, you know, something that

01:29:54.240 --> 01:30:00.320
was a throwback to the superior old school, but that its creation would highly depend

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.640
on the input of fans, and that was a quote from him.

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:08.240
Um, he said that the simple fun of a Mega Man game does not fit into the grandiose,

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:11.360
expansive world of the consumer gaming industry has become.

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:14.560
She has to make games that match the current expectations.

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:18.560
And so he really wanted to go back to how it was supposed to be.

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:24.160
And the rise of retro gaming, especially on services like Virtual Console, basically

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:25.920
made Mega Man 9 possible.

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.280
People wanted the old school.

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:35.840
Um, the audio was, uh, composed by Yamada Ippo, um, uh, Kawakami Ryo, uh, Shimodo Yu,

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:38.400
and Isogai, um, Hiroki.

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:45.600
Um, they were all people who had, um, big input, and some of them were actually veteran

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.200
composers like Yamada.

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:52.320
Um, he had been a composer for Capcom and worked with what he called a series of a sense

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.120
of nostalgia.

01:30:54.080 --> 01:31:01.440
And that, um, Shimodo Yu actually analyzed the audio of the NES Mega Man games so that

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.440
he could be as authentic to it as possible.

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:08.400
Um, as I said, it came out in 2008.

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:14.240
It was fully announced as Mega Man 9 in July 2008, and the details were announced in a

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:17.440
Weekly Hamitsu and Nintendo Power.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:25.520
Um, it was supposed to be exclusive to WiiWare, but there, of course, you know, after, you

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:31.200
know, prompting from the fans, they, uh, brought out Xbox Live Arcade and PSN copies.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:40.240
Um, there also were, um, mobile phone incarnations that were released in Japan in late 2010.

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:48.000
Uh, promotional artwork for it was done by I Am 8-Bit that was supposed to be reminiscent

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:56.640
of the really bad art we got here in the US, so the marketing campaign was meant to reflect

01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:57.140
that.

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:06.800
And, um, it also was put out with, uh, you know, uh, you could get, like, a custom box

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.400
that had that artwork on it and everything.

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.160
It was pretty, pretty crazy.

01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:14.800
And then they did, um, for other promotional stuff, there was the Ski Tank energy drinks

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:20.400
into CD soundtracks, and that came out also in September 2008.

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.160
It was pretty well received.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.440
Everyone was super happy.

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:31.520
Um, they did not release the financial figures, but said that they were cautiously optimistic

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:37.520
about its performance on WiiWare and on the other, uh, consoles, and actually, it got

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:45.840
pretty decent ratings, um, except by, like, one UK group called OPM, but they don't count.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.720
Who cares what they think?

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:55.120
There was an arcade comics, um, series, and, um, the series would go on hiatus before it

01:32:55.120 --> 01:33:00.880
could do the full storyline, but they did release Splash Woman and Concrete Man early,

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:03.600
um, in the, the series.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:10.480
And then there was, uh, um, another new character in the series called Vesper Woman, um, but

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.200
I don't recall if she ever made it into one of the games.

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:14.960
And that was it.

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.400
That's Mega Man 9.

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:19.120
You know, it's interesting that you say the Splash Woman is the one that you're supposed

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.240
to fight first, because I noticed in this, um, long play that we're using to get the

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:25.440
background music, they also took on Splash Woman first, which you might have heard the

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:29.360
background music there, but I, I think this is one of those games where there's kind of

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:33.200
multiple paths through, because I seem to remember Galaxy Man was the one that I was

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.320
told to start with.

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.480
Not Splash Woman, that was towards the end.

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:42.400
But, you know, in Mega Man 2, I know some people would start with Metal Man, some people

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:46.880
would start with Flash Man, so it's probably one of those games where there's, you know,

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.240
multiple ways through it, just depending on who you're com- there's probably a certain

01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.920
loop through it, but it's all about who are you most comfortable taking on with just the

01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:54.800
arm cannon, you know?

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.480
Well, it's who has the biggest weakness to who.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:02.720
I always did start with Mega Man first, because his weapon was much versatile.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.480
You mean, you mean Metal Man?

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.240
Metal Man, yeah, sorry, I started with Metal Man first.

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:08.800
Yeah.

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:11.840
Because he was in, and 2, because he was the most versatile.

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:17.360
But, like, everyone's got their own weakness, like, Splash Woman's primary weakness is the

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.120
Hornet Chaser from Hornet Man.

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:19.620
Yeah.

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:28.000
Concrete Man's weakness is the Laser Trident, and he said Splash Woman is also secondarily

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.680
weak to the Mega Buster.

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.480
Oh, interesting.

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:38.240
Whereas other ones are not necessarily weak to those other- to the Mega Buster, although

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:38.800
it will work.

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:44.160
Interesting, yeah, no, I swear there was a path in 2 where you can start with Metal Man,

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.440
was kind of a common one, but you could do Flash Man, then you go Flash Man to Quick

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.920
Man, and you use the time stopper on Quick Man, and it saps like a third of his health,

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:55.280
but that means you have to kill the rest of them with the Buster, it's not quite as easy.

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:57.360
But once you kind of get past that, the rest of it's keg.

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:05.200
Well, I always did Quick Man pretty much last, because I would, um, I never liked his stage,

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:05.840
first of all.

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:06.240
Yeah.

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.440
I wasn't very good at it.

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:15.040
There were some that would tell you to start off with, you know, Air Man, which I was like,

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:15.540
why?

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:20.480
But my- my first three, I would always do Metal Man first, and then I would switch between

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:22.320
either doing Flash Man or Crash Man first.

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.640
Yeah, I like the ones that have a little more versatility.

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:29.040
So anyway, I didn't mean to make a Mega Man 9 discussion about Mega Man 2, but, I mean,

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:29.600
since-

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.600
But it wasn't put after it, you know?

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:37.360
Yeah, this game was meant to evoke the feeling of, you know, when Mega Man was at its, you

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:41.920
know, peak for most people, which was arguably Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3, I think a lot-

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:46.400
I mean, you're gonna get some Mega Man fans that are like, but I love 5, 4 is the best,

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:50.880
you know, and that's- that's fine, but I think generally, it was probably at its peak with

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.520
Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3, for most people.

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:54.080
Yeah.

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:54.580
Yeah.

01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:02.720
Mega Man 2, just, I don't want to miss with people I know, is, I would say, fairly considered

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:06.720
to be the pinnacle of the series, and the rest were all really good, but Mega Man 2

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:09.680
is usually when people have the biggest fond memories of.

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:13.840
Yeah, and then there's so much of two in three, because you go back and you fight all the

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:18.240
two bosses in three, that like, it's hard to ignore that three in some ways feels like

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.160
the superior game, but I'm not gonna start that argument, that's probably already going

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.800
in our chat room, but anyway, we got to get back to the show.

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:30.480
But there it is, your classic game of the week, Mega Man 9, which believe it or not,

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:35.280
is 10 years old, even though it feels a lot older, but maybe some people experiencing

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:41.360
it relatively recently due to the Mega Man collection part 2 that had like 7, 8, 9, and

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:42.880
10 all in one collection.

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.360
I know some people get into it that way.

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:50.320
So anyway, Dark Sakura, we look forward to having you back in studio soon, and hopefully

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:54.240
before the year is out, and we might be on our Twitch thing.

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:58.480
I think we only got about one or two more Shoutcast shows in us, then we're gonna make

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.080
that big transition, so it's gonna be fun.

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.800
We'll see what happens, but yeah, for now though, I mean, I have to save up some time

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.240
off and see if I can.

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:13.040
All right, well, glad you had a good Thanksgiving, Dark Sakura, and we'll talk to you next time.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:17.040
Any parting words for our listeners tonight before we go back to the live show?

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:19.600
Coffee is wonderful.

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:27.040
Coffee is wonderful.

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.560
I just had a cup before the show.

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:33.120
Hey, we're back live with Orange Launch Radio continuing on here.

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:37.520
Episode number 753 for this November the 25th of 2018.

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:40.560
Loki joining me here in studio, of course.

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:41.360
Hello, Loki.

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:41.760
Hello.

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:42.480
What were you doing?

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:44.080
Were you playing a game over there during the break?

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.000
I thought you were Pokemon going, weren't you?

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.680
I was doing Pokemon Go stuff, and then I was putting my calories for today.

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:50.320
Oh, okay.

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:50.880
Well, that's good.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.280
You still do really good on all that health stuff.

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:53.760
Good for you.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:58.560
Yeah, this weekend I haven't really been paying attention to my diet too much, but I haven't

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.800
gained anything, so it's been fine.

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:01.600
It's Thanksgiving.

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:02.160
It doesn't count.

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:06.320
Well, last week it was all kind of screwy anyways because it was raining and because

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:11.360
I had fucked up my foot earlier in the week, so I tried walking on it, and that only screwed

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:16.800
up the side of my calf instead because I was kind of walking on the outside of my foot,

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:21.280
and even though the bottom of my foot wasn't hurting as much anymore, the side of my foot

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:25.760
was just like that muscle just got tensed up and winged.

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:27.280
Getting old sucks, huh?

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.160
I guess, yeah.

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:34.560
So I was hobbling around with that, but hopefully I feel fine enough to play DDR again this

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.680
week, so I'm going to do that.

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:36.400
I hope so.

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:36.640
Yeah.

01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:37.040
I hope so.

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:38.000
I want to come over and play...

01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:40.640
Oh, Nick, please, not so quick and do it all night.

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.720
Yeah, we need to pick a day or something.

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:44.880
Maybe the weekend or something.

01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:45.440
We'll make that work.

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:51.120
Well, also joining us virtually via Skype, we're welcoming an old friend back to the

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:55.200
show here who is celebrating a classic game of his own a little bit this week.

01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:57.200
Hey, YYR, are you there on the line with us?

01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.920
Oh, Nick, please, not so quick.

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:00.480
Oh, my favorite.

01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:01.600
That song is my jam.

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.520
That was the song that really made me fall in love with DDR.

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.320
This song is so over the top.

01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:08.000
It's pretty ridiculous.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.560
It's ridiculous, yeah, as video games should be.

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:12.080
Video games should be over the top ridiculous.

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:12.720
Those are my favorites.

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.360
A little bit.

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:14.560
How are you doing, YYR?

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:18.320
I'm actually doing pretty well.

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:22.480
Yeah, I actually was just playing In the Groove earlier and I passed Hardcore of the North,

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:28.480
which was ridiculous because that has more steps than any other In the Groove single

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:30.240
expert official chart.

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:31.440
So that was cool.

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.240
I was not aware.

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:37.040
I really would love to play Kyle's new Step Maniacs game at some point, though.

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:40.960
I think it's doing really well overseas, like in Germany.

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:44.640
I keep seeing on his Facebook, I sold another 5,000 machines in Germany.

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:45.520
I'm making these numbers up.

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:48.160
But you know, it's like his game is huge in Germany.

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:50.640
He's like, he made the David Hasselhoff of video games.

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.280
Well, I'll say this much.

01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:56.320
We do have a machine in New Jersey at 8 on the break.

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:56.960
Of course.

01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:59.200
And I have gotten to play on it.

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:03.520
And I mean, if you like to play double, it's lacking in content right now.

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:08.000
But in every other respect, it feels very polished, very fun to play.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:13.520
And I apologize for any baby screaming in the background because she's very excited

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:13.920
right now.

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.360
Don't apologize for that.

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:16.800
And 8 on the break.

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.160
I've been there.

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.200
It was many years ago.

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.480
It was many, many years ago.

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:23.920
But my favorite arcade in New Jersey, the only one I've been to.

01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:24.640
I'll say that.

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:25.040
Free plug.

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:26.400
Not much has changed either.

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.440
They still have delicious break steaks at the bar.

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:35.680
And yeah, classic games all over the place and a lot of music games.

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:40.320
Well, speaking of classic games, YYR, you're kind of calling in a bit tonight because you're

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.840
celebrating an anniversary.

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:45.360
Obviously, you've been celebrating a lot of new changes in your life with your new child

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:48.880
and all, but you're kind of celebrating a big birthday as well, right?

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:50.960
Yeah, something like that.

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:54.240
So on November 20th, 2008.

01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:00.480
Actually, I think it was November 19th that this thing launched the Xbox Live Community

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:04.880
Games, which then was later renamed to Xbox Live Indie Games.

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:08.400
And then on November 20th, Snake 360 came out.

01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:11.280
So yeah, it's been 10 years.

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:14.560
So are you here to lobby for Snake 360 to be a Classic Game of the Week?

01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.000
Because I don't think January would wear.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:16.320
I don't know.

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:16.720
We'll see.

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:17.120
We'll see.

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.720
I don't know about that.

01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:25.120
That's, that would be, you know, pretty epic to make it onto Orange Lounge Radio Classic

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:25.840
Game of the Week.

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:33.280
But, you know, I'm not going to have any delusions of grandeur, but no, it's Switch version when

01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:34.000
I see in chat.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.040
Thanks, Dr. Tetsuya.

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:40.400
That's when you know you've made it because everybody will ask on your AMA on Reddit.

01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:42.560
Switch version when it's for begging.

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:46.240
If you get Switch port begging you, you may in fact have made it.

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.920
Yes, absolutely.

01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.280
Well, 10 years later.

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:54.160
So I mean, I guess the kind of sad thing is obviously the Xbox Indie Games as we know

01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:58.160
it from before no longer exists, but they kind of they kind of brought it back in a

01:41:58.160 --> 01:41:59.040
different form, right?

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:04.480
So it's called the Xbox Live Creators Program.

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:12.880
And if you go, if you have an Xbox One and you go to the store underneath all of the,

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:16.080
you know, sale, boom, AAA stuff.

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:19.600
Yeah, you're going to find this little tab that says Creators Collection.

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:23.600
And if you go in there, you're going to find this, you know, little sectioned off, kind

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.440
of like Xbox Live Indie Games was.

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:31.360
But nonetheless, you're going to find a bunch of stuff in there that is not rated by the

01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:38.720
ESRB and does not have achievements or online play, but otherwise, you know, is put together

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:43.280
by, you know, hobbyists or, you know, people that couldn't get approved for the independent

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.240
developer program.

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:50.720
Just, you know, some fun stuff that was approved by Microsoft for release and that you can

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:53.120
buy just like Xbox Live Indie Games.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.200
But unfortunately, the Xbox Live Indie Games didn't cross over.

01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:00.080
So it's like Snake 360 unavailable on this, right?

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.360
That's right.

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:03.520
None of the old games made it.

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:09.680
The only chance that the old games make it over is if the developer decides to republish

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:09.920
it.

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:15.840
And, you know, they can't just go because some things have changed, things like how

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:21.840
the game save files, because if you think about it, you know, Xbox One works a lot differently

01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:23.520
than 360 in that regard.

01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:28.560
You don't have, you know, all you can have a hard drive or a storage unit or, you know,

01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:31.440
USB or whatever Xbox work.

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:36.400
The Xbox One works with cloud saves and they follow you everywhere and some different work

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:37.680
has to be done to enable that.

01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:39.360
And I am looking into it, by the way.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:41.760
Nice.

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:49.680
I'm actually hoping to release my first title on the Creator's Collection probably in the

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:52.800
next couple of months, and that's going to be Falling Plus.

01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:57.200
I think honestly, Falling Plus is like my Ridge Racer.

01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:01.440
I'm releasing it on every platform that I want to be on to get my feet wet.

01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:03.440
And then after that, the other stuff will come.

01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:07.040
Falling is kind of your ode to like 80s classics, right?

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:07.760
I've played that one.

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:09.600
It's kind of a fun little puzzler.

01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:13.600
Feels like something that would have been in an arcade in the 80s.

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.480
That's exactly the vibe I was going for.

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:20.000
It's, you know, basically, I mean, I'm thinking Bubble Bobble.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.600
It doesn't quite have that level of complexity, but, you know, it's basically like, you know,

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:29.920
you're a penguin, the walrus is trying to bust in and colored blocks are falling from

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:30.480
the ceiling.

01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:33.680
Of course, later levels, this happens faster.

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:36.800
But what you're doing is you're matching colors to clear the blocks.

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:40.320
And of course, every so often the walrus is going to get in your way and you have to kind

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:44.080
of crush him, smash him against another block, and so on.

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:44.880
Poor walrus.

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:46.800
Yeah.

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:53.360
Let me ask this, like, now, you know, we're 10 years after you putting out, you know,

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.720
Snake 360.

01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:01.520
What have you kind of learned about gaming through this whole, the gaming yourself, the

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:02.080
indie games?

01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:05.840
What have you learned through this whole experience of putting a game out and, you know, continuing

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:10.720
to, as a hobbyist, you know, put games out because obviously, you know, we were big fans

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:11.120
of Bungie.

01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:12.720
Ferretossing on 360 as well.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.480
You know, we still stand by Super Multitasking as a game that, and thank you for that.

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.720
Breakthrough is coming any day now on Steam.

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:25.440
And by the way, it's on sale for 20% off at the moment as part of the Steam Autumn sale.

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:26.000
There you go.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.040
Which does end soon.

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.280
Cheap plug, but I approve.

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:34.480
Going to chat, ssh100mad, does Falling Plus have a kill screen?

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:35.920
No, sadly it does not.

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:37.920
Bummer.

01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.400
That's okay.

01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:41.840
Maybe, maybe Falling Plus Plus second mix new stage.

01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:46.800
But one thing, okay, so what have I learned?

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:55.280
So I mean, Snake 360, I put 11 really hard months of development into.

01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:00.080
I don't think I've ever worked so hard on anything ever, including at my job.

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:01.280
So sorry, job.

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:09.440
But definitely I learned that however hard you think it is to actually put a game together

01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:14.880
and release it, multiply that by probably around between 5 and 10.

01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:16.000
And that's how hard it is.

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:21.200
I mean, and most of it comes with, you know, the part at the end.

01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:25.200
Because it's one thing to get a game working.

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:25.920
That's easy.

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:26.960
That's the easy part.

01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.240
That's the fun part.

01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:33.360
You know, you put together your concept and it's like, hey, I can play this and it's fun.

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:34.720
Great, I'm done.

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:36.240
No, no, you're not done.

01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:40.800
Because now what you have to do is you have to make sure it works at a variety of different

01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:41.760
resolutions.

01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:46.400
Because if you're releasing on PC, you don't want to be told, well, you have to run this

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.480
at 720p widescreen.

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:52.240
No, no, actually you want to run it at whatever resolution you want.

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:55.680
And maybe you want it to work with controllers.

01:46:55.680 --> 01:47:00.800
Well, okay, now test it with the Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers and the DualShock

01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:06.240
4 and the Steam controller and the Switch Pro controller and make sure it works perfectly

01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:07.040
with all of those.

01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:11.120
And if you're releasing a Mac version, make sure it works with all of those controllers

01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:12.320
on Mac also.

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:14.400
Man, this QA testing is the worst.

01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:15.920
That's why Bethesda doesn't bother.

01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:17.860
Right.

01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:21.280
But no, you're right.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.720
I mean, not that that should stop people from making their own game for sure, but there

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:27.440
is a lot more that goes into it that people don't realize.

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:31.200
The polish is really the hardest part.

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:37.920
And not just because you have to be very thorough, but also because it's not the exciting part.

01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:41.840
The exciting part is putting your game together and seeing it come to life.

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:50.320
The most amazing part of super multitasking was making it to the point where I had enough

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:55.440
minigames that I could create the algorithm that starts and stops the minigames.

01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:01.600
That magic when it first worked and when I realized the concept was fun, that was magic.

01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:02.560
That was awesome.

01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:03.520
That was amazing.

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:06.880
I lit up like a Christmas tree and I don't even celebrate Christmas.

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:14.560
So, but, you know, then it's like the actual work of getting the game ready for release.

01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:17.200
It's many, many times that.

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:22.320
And Black Wolf in chat says the last 10% of development takes 90% of the time.

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.000
And he's pretty much right.

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:29.120
And also, he said the part YYR is talking about is the part where Loki quits.

01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:31.520
No, he didn't even get that far, but yeah.

01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:32.020
Yeah.

01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:38.020
I remember I can't even get far enough to mod a stupid theme for set mania.

01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:38.340
Okay.

01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:40.500
Like I was watching YouTube instead of the day.

01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:43.860
Bobby's used that quote before and I've heard that, you know,

01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:46.660
similar iterations of that quite a bit when it comes to game development.

01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:47.620
It's very true.

01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:48.180
Definitely.

01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:48.820
So what's next?

01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:53.460
And box 006 is just quickly reminding us that Bethesda does do QA testing.

01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:54.740
It's just done by the gamers.

01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:57.540
Let's be fair.

01:48:57.540 --> 01:48:59.140
Bethesda does QA testing.

01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:01.940
It's just Bethesda exacts a fucking ship it anyways.

01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:02.420
Yeah, exactly.

01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:05.620
The boardroom decisions are usually like, eh, it's not that big a deal.

01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:06.580
Gamers will buy it anyway.

01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:08.580
What's next for you?

01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:11.220
What are you gonna use this 10 year of experience in the future?

01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:20.420
Well, honestly, I'm not looking forward another 10 years so much as this next year.

01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:23.460
And it is a lot more difficult with a baby around.

01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:28.500
But I think what I'm really gonna try to do is build my brand or attempt to

01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:35.220
over the next year by expanding my offerings on more platforms.

01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:39.860
And, you know, just to let everybody know.

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:47.380
So the beginning of that is I'm moving Falling Plus from itch.io where it's been to Steam.

01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:51.940
It's actually releasing in five days on November 30th.

01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:53.380
Oh, shoot.

01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:54.100
There you go.

01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:55.220
Very timely announcement.

01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:57.860
People might be listening to this on November 30th.

01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:02.820
Well, if you're listening right now and you're in the chat room, the first thing I'm going

01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:08.580
to do when I get off this call is anybody who is in the chat room is going to receive

01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:10.580
a Steam key for this game.

01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:11.080
What?

01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:12.500
That's awesome.

01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:13.860
You get Falling Plus.

01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:15.540
And you get Falling Plus.

01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:17.140
And you get Falling Plus.

01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:18.420
You all get Falling Plus.

01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:20.340
Oh, ho ho ho.

01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:21.780
It's the holiday spirit.

01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:22.660
I love it.

01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:23.460
That's amazing.

01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:26.500
Everybody in the chat room is getting a free game tonight.

01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:27.140
That's great.

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.060
That's very generous of you, Santa.

01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:29.780
I appreciate that.

01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:31.540
And you don't even celebrate Christmas.

01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:33.060
But still, the holiday spirit.

01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:33.940
It's all there.

01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:35.460
Hey, it could be for Hanukkah, too.

01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:41.220
Mind you, if you're listening on the podcast feed, it's not, you know, all for naught.

01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:47.780
If you send me an email at yyr at yyrgames.com and mention OLR, you will get one as well.

01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:48.420
What?

01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:49.780
That's crazy.

01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:50.660
That's amazing.

01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:53.460
You might want to put a deadline on that, though, so that people don't go like, hey.

01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:56.100
You have until the next episode is on.

01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:56.900
Post a form.

01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:57.300
Yeah.

01:50:57.300 --> 01:51:00.180
If you don't recognize a name, yyr, I need to run it by me.

01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:04.100
If you start getting flooded with all these emails from, like, other countries, I pretty

01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:06.820
much know who all the listeners in other countries are at this point.

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:08.420
So I'll let you know.

01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:10.660
That's awesome.

01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:11.300
So, yeah.

01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:13.620
Everybody in the chat room is very jazzed about this.

01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:18.420
Boncival06 says, yyr coming in with the gift for all the girls and boys.

01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:19.540
Let's see.

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:20.740
Okay.

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:23.060
I like some of these other questions coming in, too.

01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:26.260
Oh, BlackWolf wants to know, is it unlocked now or does it unlock on the 30th?

01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:28.820
These are pre-release redemption codes.

01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:29.940
You can play it right away.

01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:31.380
That's awesome.

01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:32.420
That is so great.

01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:33.620
Okay, cool.

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:38.340
And I think if you if you want to give me money and pay for the game, then feel free

01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:39.940
to pass the code on to somebody else.

01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:42.900
That's that's so awesome of you to do.

01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:44.340
And actually, let's see.

01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:47.140
Well, before I get to that, S2100Matt is asking a question.

01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:48.020
I think this is really good.

01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:52.340
What are your thoughts on the Intellivision Amico and would you try to get your games

01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:53.300
on the console?

01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:59.300
You know, Amico is a very unique type of platform that might be kind of trying to cater itself

01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:04.020
to more like, you know, developers that are well, first off, they'd have to be exclusive

01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:04.340
games.

01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:07.300
But I suppose you could always do a falling plus plus or you know what I mean?

01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:12.900
But I mean, since you try to invoke 80s classics, I could see where something like Intellivision

01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:13.780
might be right up your alley.

01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:21.300
So it's funny that you ask that, because remember I said I'm trying to build my brand.

01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:25.300
So there's a multiple pronged approach here.

01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:29.300
I am going to be releasing falling plus on Steam.

01:52:30.020 --> 01:52:35.700
The next thing I'm going to be working on after a super multitasking update is I'm officially

01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:37.860
announcing Bungee Ferret Tossing Turbo.

01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:40.820
That will be coming to Steam next.

01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:43.060
Yay, Bungee Ferret Tossing is coming back.

01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:45.300
So exciting.

01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:46.100
For those that don't know.

01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:47.460
Improved graphics.

01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:50.500
In case we do have some newer listeners out there, for those who don't know, Bungee Ferret

01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:55.540
Tossing was a game YYR made based off a conversation that happened on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:57.780
We were talking about one of our many dream games.

01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:01.700
YYR made a dream game here on Orange Lounge Radio a reality, which is amazing.

01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:08.420
And yes, Bobby Black Wolf, it will have the Wolf News segment, although you are not the

01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:08.980
villain, no.

01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:16.580
But yes, it'll feature improved graphics and also an arranged mode where not only can you

01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:21.540
add turbo speed to it, but also you can unlock all kinds of fun things that will allow you

01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:23.620
to tweak the gameplay and break it.

01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:27.060
But yeah, so please look forward to that.

01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:29.940
I'm hoping to ship it sometime first quarter of next year.

01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:37.540
And then once I have that stuff on Steam, I'm also planning to try to release this stuff

01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:39.540
on Windows 10 and Xbox One.

01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:46.340
Now, I'm hoping to have all that stuff done and possibly a re-release of Snake by the

01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:47.620
middle of next year.

01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:49.460
Guess what happens the middle of next year?

01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:54.100
The Intellivision Amico dev kits become available.

01:53:54.900 --> 01:54:01.940
Now, I am racking my brain when I lay down to sleep, when I'm in the shower, when I'm

01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:03.380
doing other things.

01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:10.500
I'm racking my brain trying to come up with some good game concepts, not just to make

01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:16.980
a game, but to make a game that will play very well on that weirdo controller that they're

01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:18.900
shipping with the Amico.

01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:24.820
And I wish I could come up with something really great.

01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:25.620
And you know what?

01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:30.500
I have a couple of beginnings right now, but I'm still working it out.

01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:34.500
And I actually think I'm going to pick up in an old Intellivision just so I can get

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:38.180
more of a sense for what the dial is going to feel like.

01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:44.420
You might be the first dev I've heard on a show lobbying to make an Intellivision game.

01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:47.860
Well, here's the thing.

01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:50.900
If you look at the specs, first of all, it has to be something original.

01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:51.940
That's fine.

01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:54.500
Second of all, it has to be between three and eight bucks.

01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:56.500
All my games are between three and eight bucks.

01:54:57.060 --> 01:54:57.460
All right.

01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:06.180
They're looking probably to put, you know, retro inspired, short burst types of gameplay.

01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:07.220
That's what I do.

01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:13.380
It seems to me like it would be silly for me not to try it.

01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:15.380
Yeah, we're going to help however we can.

01:55:15.380 --> 01:55:16.180
I mean, we've not.

01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:17.620
I mean, Tommy is a busy guy.

01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:18.660
He's been on the show before.

01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:19.460
We have an email.

01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:20.340
So, you know, you never know.

01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:20.740
You never know.

01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:21.380
We can.

01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:23.460
We'll try to help you out best we can.

01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:24.980
So that's great.

01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:25.380
Thank you.

01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:32.660
I really appreciate you given that doing that Oprah moment with falling for all of our chatters

01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:33.780
and listeners.

01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:34.980
It's really, really great.

01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:36.500
It's the least that I can do.

01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:41.220
I mean, not only do you guys plug my stuff at every opportunity, but you've also provided

01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:45.060
me with all of this entertainment over the last, you know, over ten years.

01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:47.700
You do what you do because you love video games.

01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:49.540
We do what we do because we love video games.

01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:52.660
We all kind of contributed in our own way.

01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:54.260
Hey, Bobby wants to know if he can stream.

01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:58.900
If there's an embargo on streaming or if he can just stream it after OLR tonight.

01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:00.500
Yeah, you can go ahead.

01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:01.140
All right.

01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:06.100
You know, just mention it's coming out in a few days and that's it.

01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:07.940
He'll work in your plug.

01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:08.420
You're good.

01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:09.800
Awesome.

01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:13.380
But yeah, just finishing up the Amico business.

01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:20.420
You know, going back to Snake 360, another thing that I did learn is that when you have

01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:23.780
a young marketplace, there are more eyeballs looking at it.

01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:29.780
The most money I ever made off of one of my games was when Snake 360 just came out and

01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:33.300
there were fewer games on the store and there were lots of eyeballs looking at this brand

01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:34.580
new thing that just came out.

01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:36.260
Hey, so you know what's funny?

01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:37.700
You know, it's funny why we are.

01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:40.260
Do you know when OLR had the most listeners ever?

01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:44.260
When it was new, the week iTunes podcasting launched.

01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:47.620
Yeah, we make perfect sense.

01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:50.020
Remember, this show existed well before then.

01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:54.180
We had the to go edition that was on when you had to use like Lemon Potter and all that.

01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:58.020
All those other apps to podcasts on your iPod because there weren't even the phones yet.

01:56:58.020 --> 01:56:59.220
So this show existed back then.

01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:04.020
So the week we were on the store, I think there's maybe only like one or two other gaming

01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:08.900
podcasts that exist today that were on the store when iTunes launched that.

01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:10.740
And we've never been bigger.

01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:13.860
And honestly and humbly, we'll probably never be that big again.

01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:17.860
But that's what you know what I'm I'm just hoping.

01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:21.380
I mean, I haven't been that big since since Snake 360.

01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:27.460
And I'm just hoping that, you know, basically the reason I'm trying to build the brand,

01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:30.660
you know, release a few games on Steam, release a few games on Xbox.

01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:33.940
It's like I'm hoping that this is what happens.

01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:39.700
YYR Games is announced as one of the first developers on Amico.

01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:40.740
Who the heck is that?

01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:42.820
They look into me.

01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:44.580
Oh, they have a few games available.

01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:46.020
Hey, this looks interesting.

01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:47.140
Click, click, click, bye.

01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:51.700
So maybe, maybe, maybe it'll happen.

01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:52.500
Maybe not.

01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:54.660
But it's worth a shot, right?

01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:57.940
Hey, if we're rooting for anybody here at OLR YYR, it's you.

01:57:57.940 --> 01:57:59.700
We want to we want to see it happen for you.

01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:00.980
So you you deserve it.

01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:03.300
And not just because you hand our listeners free stuff.

01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:06.500
You know, we've supported your your stuff anyway.

01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:10.420
So I I really wish you the success and I do hope we get to see your name on television

01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:13.220
splash screen, you know, in a year or so.

01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:14.260
So thank you.

01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:18.740
I will address Bonds006 speaking of the free stuff.

01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:21.460
He says, so are we doing QA for your game YYR?

01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:24.500
Well, ain't nothing in this world truly free.

01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:28.740
I will tell you this.

01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:31.380
This is actually an update to an already released game.

01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:34.660
Although I did fix a number of issues in this version.

01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:39.140
The only thing that has not been exhaustively tested is the leaderboard browser.

01:58:39.140 --> 01:58:44.020
So I'm hoping that a few of you play it and that I will be able to, you know, take a look

01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:46.180
and quickly patch things if they don't work.

01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:51.540
But it should work because it was just based off of super multitaskings and super multitaskings

01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:52.420
works.

01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:53.780
So it should be fine.

01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:55.220
All right.

01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:56.020
That's but yeah.

01:58:56.020 --> 01:58:56.260
Yeah.

01:58:56.260 --> 01:59:01.380
That's that's still you never know people's weird PC configurations and stuff.

01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:03.460
You never know what feedback you might get in the next couple of days.

01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:05.060
And that's valuable feedback to have.

01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:06.660
Yeah.

01:59:06.660 --> 01:59:08.020
And I'd appreciate it.

01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:13.140
So yeah, be sure to do the thumbs up the ratings, do the things that will get a notice because

01:59:13.140 --> 01:59:14.740
yeah, we want YYR to succeed.

01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:17.940
So yeah, you're already a success YYR.

01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:18.260
All right.

01:59:19.140 --> 01:59:23.220
We do have to let you go, though, so we can wrap up our show and let Bobby do a stream

01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:23.700
of the game.

01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:26.020
So but thank you so much again.

01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:29.460
And I know we'll have you back on the show soon when you're ready to announce whatever

01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:33.620
your next project is coming to steam or wherever it is you go and someday in television.

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:35.300
All right.

01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:35.700
All right.

01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:36.660
I'll be here.

01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:36.980
All right.

01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:37.700
Take care, my friend.

01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:38.820
All right.

01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:42.900
Have a great week and I'll start sending out those codes momentarily.

01:59:42.900 --> 01:59:43.220
All right.

01:59:43.220 --> 01:59:43.940
Sounds good.

01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:44.660
Thank you so much.

01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:44.980
Bye.

01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:45.460
Take care.

01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:45.780
All right.

01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:46.740
Take care, guys.

01:59:46.740 --> 01:59:48.020
Bye bye bye.

01:59:48.020 --> 01:59:48.820
That is awesome.

01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:52.020
Just so you know, I did not know he was going to do that.

01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:55.220
I kind of knew that he was going to tell it.

01:59:55.220 --> 01:59:57.940
I knew we were kind of getting the exclusive on a new steam thing like that.

01:59:57.940 --> 01:59:59.940
I knew I did not know he was going to do that.

01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:01.300
So that is really, really cool.

02:00:01.300 --> 02:00:02.180
Why we are to do that.

02:00:02.180 --> 02:00:03.220
So awesome.

02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:03.700
Awesome.

02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:03.940
Yeah.

02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:05.460
I'm going to be playing that as well.

02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:05.960
All right.

02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:08.180
Anyhow, I know.

02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:10.980
Do you want to hear the cruel irony in this whole thing?

02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:12.100
That's really funny.

02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:15.060
So I guess Ragenator like forgot the shows on the night or something because he's doing

02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:16.420
his own Twitch stream, which is fine.

02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:17.780
You know, there's only so many days in the week.

02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:19.620
You got to do what you got to do when I don't care.

02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:23.780
But the one night someone's here giving away a free game on Steam.

02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:24.420
He's not here.

02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:28.340
Poor guy.

02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:30.820
I can give them a copy.

02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:31.140
All right.

02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:33.300
He can send the email.

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:35.700
Everybody knows that dude's name.

02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:37.380
Yyr will recognize him in a heartbeat.

02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:40.500
I just I would want somebody to be like, oh, email this guy.

02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:41.300
He'll give you a free.

02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:44.580
Like, I want to make sure that the people who redeem the code are actually people.

02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:45.460
Listen, all are.

02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:49.140
So make sure just try to keep it amongst friends, y'all.

02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:49.540
All right.

02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:52.260
Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news.

02:00:52.260 --> 02:00:54.580
I don't know how we top free game announcement.

02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:57.380
Do you do do you get free games listening to other podcasts?

02:00:58.020 --> 02:00:58.820
Not that I'm here to.

02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:00.180
I love I love all podcasts.

02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:00.820
You guys know that.

02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:05.700
But I'm going to I'm going to take the little the little promotion opportunities.

02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:11.540
We listen to a lot of podcasting where I used to listen to the dev log a lot that, you know,

02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:13.620
unity programming podcasts.

02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:15.300
But I haven't listened to that in a while.

02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:16.900
I need to catch up on that.

02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:21.300
But Bobby and chat with the Debbie Downer comment.

02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:24.260
Actually, a lot of podcasts give out free codes to every listener.

02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:25.620
Bobby, to every listener.

02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:26.660
I don't know about that.

02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:27.460
I don't know about that.

02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:28.180
All right.

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:29.060
Maybe they do.

02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:29.380
I don't know.

02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:30.340
I thought I thought.

02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:31.780
But it's not for this game.

02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:35.700
I'll take what I can get.

02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:36.660
Sorry, Loki.

02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:36.900
Yeah.

02:01:37.780 --> 02:01:38.340
All right.

02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:39.780
Let's get into some rapid fire news.

02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:41.780
There is plenty of other stuff going on in the game industry.

02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:43.060
We'll do some rapid fire news.

02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:43.700
Loki.

02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:44.420
All right.

02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:50.580
So let's talk a little bit about how Super Mario Odyssey is getting some new costumes.

02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:50.980
Yay.

02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:53.300
I haven't played Super Mario Odyssey in a while.

02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:56.340
I really should go back and do that because I still haven't gotten all of.

02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:00.180
All of the collectibles in that.

02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:07.380
But if you're continuing to play the game, you'll be able to get a Santa outfit or they

02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:13.300
also have the 8-bit Mario kind of looks like the 8-bit Mario amiibo that they had.

02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:18.580
So you'll be able to check out that kind of voxel Mario look.

02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:23.140
And that's going to be coming soon, I believe, in an update.

02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:26.500
I imagine it'll probably look like the 8-bit amiibo does kind of in that.

02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:27.380
That's exactly what I said.

02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:27.620
OK.

02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:28.260
Oh, sorry.

02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:29.540
OK.

02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:31.540
So yeah, check it out.

02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:40.740
And then there's an expansion coming to Civ 6, which is going to be February 14th called

02:02:40.740 --> 02:02:41.940
the Gathering Storm.

02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:48.980
And apparently it's the second expansion for the game and they're adding, I guess, global

02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:52.100
warming or different like weather in the game.

02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:57.540
So they have like apparently how you use natural resources.

02:02:58.980 --> 02:03:04.020
It's going to affect the weather, natural disasters and global warming.

02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:10.580
So you get the balance between, you know, progress and destroying the planet.

02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:12.340
I've been slacking on Civilization 6.

02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:16.820
I need to play more, but I kind of love that they're incorporating this into the game,

02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:21.060
even though it's almost like it kind of reminds me with like flooding was a natural disaster

02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:22.180
in the original SimCity.

02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:27.380
It's kind of like they've taken that to the next step, which is sadly rooted in reality

02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:27.700
a little bit.

02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:34.660
Aside from the climate stuff, they also have expanded technology, civic trees into a future

02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:38.340
era and adds nine new leaders across eight new civilizations.

02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:38.820
Oh, wow.

02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:42.100
So is there any civilization you can't be at this point?

02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:43.060
It's pretty crazy.

02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:43.560
Epics.

02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:47.140
Yeah, like in winter games.

02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:49.460
And this came out on the Commodore 64.

02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:51.060
I don't know if you ever played those Olympic games.

02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:53.060
No, I remember the like California games.

02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:55.220
Yeah, you could pick what country you were from.

02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:57.220
And one of the countries you could pick was Epics.

02:03:57.220 --> 02:03:59.460
Epics, the studio that made the game.

02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:03.700
So that's the one civilization that's not represented in Civ at this point is Epics.

02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:10.580
Anyway, that's at the forefront of my mind because just recently Bobby was doing one

02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:12.900
of his streams of the Commodore 64 mini.

02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:16.500
And so he was playing because like all of those games, because I didn't really realize

02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:19.300
this, but they were releasing one of those games like every year.

02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:20.420
They did summer games.

02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:21.300
They did winter games.

02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:22.260
They did summer games too.

02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:23.460
They did California games.

02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:24.580
They did world games.

02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:26.180
I forgot that even existed.

02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:26.980
Like they were cranking out those games.

02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:29.700
Yeah, I used to play a ton of California games.

02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:34.660
That was on, um, I think the NES or Super NES was when I was playing that.

02:04:34.660 --> 02:04:36.260
But then I had that on the Lynx too.

02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:42.020
That was my go-to game on the Lynx because the Lynx had, um, it was BMX.

02:04:42.020 --> 02:04:44.820
There was surfing, hacky sack.

02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:47.140
And I don't remember the last one.

02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:48.100
That was California games.

02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:48.420
Yeah.

02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:50.100
Uh, frisbee maybe.

02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:50.420
I don't know.

02:04:50.420 --> 02:04:50.580
Yeah.

02:04:50.580 --> 02:04:52.100
And it's impossible to catch a frisbee.

02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:54.020
That is all on the Commodore 64 mini.

02:04:54.020 --> 02:04:57.860
All those games games are the games games.

02:04:57.860 --> 02:04:58.340
I don't know.

02:04:58.340 --> 02:04:59.380
I don't know what else you call that.

02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:00.740
California is hacky sack.

02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:01.700
That's aged well.

02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:01.940
Yeah.

02:05:01.940 --> 02:05:02.180
Yeah.

02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:02.500
I know.

02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:02.820
Right.

02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:04.500
Well, the world games was pretty cool too.

02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:05.620
So this is the other head on.

02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:08.100
The BMX one is fun because it's going downhill.

02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:12.020
So it was just like, okay, I'm going to Yolo this right now and see what happens,

02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:12.420
you know?

02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:12.580
Yeah.

02:05:12.580 --> 02:05:15.540
And it's, it's interesting as Bobby Blackwell points out, because it's almost

02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:19.780
like a little time capsule of society in the eighties, because you can be from the

02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:24.500
USSR, you can be from West Germany and like, you know, because these games were

02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:27.540
from 1984, 1985 when the world was different.

02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:28.180
Yes.

02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:29.060
Kind of neat.

02:05:29.060 --> 02:05:29.540
Anyway.

02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:29.780
Sorry.

02:05:29.780 --> 02:05:30.900
I didn't mean to digress too much.

02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:31.620
Czechoslovakia.

02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:37.860
Didn't mean to make a civilization six discussion about California games, but

02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:38.660
here we are.

02:05:40.420 --> 02:05:41.300
I did it.

02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:42.020
Anyway.

02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:46.180
Let's talk about Netflix and shows that are doing very well on Netflix.

02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:48.900
The Castlevania series apparently doing very well.

02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:51.540
I've been watching it, thought about it the other day, but then my wife's like,

02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:54.900
no, I need to, I need to, I just haven't got around to it.

02:05:54.900 --> 02:05:56.340
I keep getting sucked into MMOs.

02:05:56.340 --> 02:06:00.420
But anyway, executive producer, Adisha and car, uh, has mentioned about the

02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:01.780
Netflix Castlevania series.

02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:04.100
Uh, it really over performed.

02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:05.140
It did crazy.

02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:08.100
Well, we immediately got greenlit for season three.

02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:10.340
I wouldn't have a job if it wasn't for the fans.

02:06:10.340 --> 02:06:11.700
So congrats on the success.

02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:13.540
I hear a lot of great things about the anime.

02:06:13.540 --> 02:06:15.380
I will sit down and watch it at some point.

02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:18.260
You know, I'm going to watch that ingress anime when it finally comes to Netflix.

02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:19.620
Cause it's, oh, is that coming to Netflix?

02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:21.460
It's airing in Japan right now.

02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:22.980
So it's doing like the weekly thing in Japan.

02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:26.260
And then I think like this month or sometime really soon,

02:06:26.260 --> 02:06:29.300
once all the episodes have aired, then they're going to release it on Netflix.

02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:31.940
Am I still going to understand what ingress is about after watching it?

02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:34.100
Cause I fucking don't know what ingress is about.

02:06:34.100 --> 02:06:34.980
I just play the game.

02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:36.820
Like, I don't know the fucking lore is.

02:06:36.820 --> 02:06:39.300
I know this makes any goddamn sense.

02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:42.740
It's kind of like, like world of Warcraft has this really deep lore that, you know,

02:06:42.740 --> 02:06:44.660
what it means to be horrid and what it means to be Alliance.

02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:46.100
And ingress is kind of the same thing with it.

02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:51.220
Like I keep seeing these like ingress prime advertisements on YouTube and stuff like that.

02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:53.940
And they're like, I'm like, I don't fucking know what's going on.

02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:57.140
We're seeing, we're seeing some new players, uh, pop up in the game.

02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:59.700
So it's kinda, it's kinda refreshing to have that game kind of

02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:03.140
a little, get a little kick in the ass and get invigorated all the free time for that.

02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:04.980
And it's just time, time, time, time.

02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:05.460
You know what though?

02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:08.420
I found it to be a good, like, because I have been,

02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:10.580
there's been the double XP thing that's been going on.

02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:13.380
I don't know if I talked about this in my gaming week, probably just,

02:07:13.380 --> 02:07:15.460
I've been trying to focus on the mobile games less.

02:07:15.460 --> 02:07:18.180
Cause I know they're kind of like my ongoing, I do them every week,

02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:21.220
but I, because double XP is going on in ingress right now,

02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:24.340
like I have been out there trying to do like a lot of micro fielding.

02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:28.260
I was over at one of the cemeteries today, just walking, walking, walking.

02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:32.100
And I was, you know, walking for a good, probably hour out there.

02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:35.220
Now granted it's walk, stop, walk, stop, but sometimes it's like,

02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:38.260
Oh, I got to walk from this corner of the cemetery all the way back over there.

02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:39.380
Cause I have that key over there.

02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:41.300
So, you know, it's, it's decent exercise.

02:07:41.300 --> 02:07:44.340
It's better than sitting at home playing California games, hacky sack.

02:07:44.340 --> 02:07:44.580
Yeah.

02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:46.100
So there's that.

02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:50.260
Anyway, uh, Castlevania is doing very well and looks like it will have a, uh,

02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:52.340
another version that's coming out there.

02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:54.660
Um, Loki, you may have to help me on this one.

02:07:54.660 --> 02:07:56.100
Cause for some reason, the story is not loading,

02:07:56.100 --> 02:07:59.540
but I don't know if there's much more to say on this other than that dead or alive,

02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:04.900
extreme three scarlet is coming out for the PlayStation four and the switch.

02:08:04.900 --> 02:08:06.980
That's an odd game for the switch, but okay.

02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:07.540
Whatever.

02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:11.940
So those of you that are fans of dead or alive extreme, which is, if I remember right,

02:08:11.940 --> 02:08:15.780
the volleyball and the titties and all the anime titties,

02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:17.860
it's actually, it's two different ones.

02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:23.700
So they have the scarlet for PlayStation four and on the switch is dead or life festival 2018.

02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:24.500
Oh, excuse me.

02:08:24.500 --> 02:08:26.420
So it's going to be a different game.

02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:31.860
I guess that one, they're going to launch, um, March 20th, 2019 in Japan.

02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:42.820
And it says, um, Misaka or Misaki who appears in the DMM games, uh, is going to be in dead

02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:45.860
or live extreme Venus vacation for PC.

02:08:45.860 --> 02:08:47.380
So there's a PC game coming too.

02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:52.260
Uh, and apparently pre-orders are open and they have an official website open.

02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:56.420
So I have no idea why all this is, but I guess we'll find out.

02:08:57.060 --> 02:08:59.940
Uh, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:02.900
Luckily the chat room is really into the games discussion here.

02:09:02.900 --> 02:09:06.580
Vid power says, I like how hacky sack in California games is called foot bag.

02:09:07.140 --> 02:09:07.540
That's right.

02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:08.260
It was called foot bag.

02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:11.700
And I think it's one of those things kind of like how Kleenex is really tissue,

02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:12.660
but everybody calls it Kleenex.

02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:13.060
You know what I mean?

02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:14.500
I think hacky sack is a brand.

02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:16.020
So I think that's why they couldn't call it that.

02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:19.300
Um, uh, like Xerox is a copy and all that.

02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:23.220
And, uh, if you're, I remember there was some famous court case where like,

02:09:23.220 --> 02:09:28.260
if your name gets associated with it so much, you end up kind of like losing your,

02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:30.020
I guess, trademark in some ways or whatever.

02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:33.700
And I think it was Xerox or somebody that lost one of the,

02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:37.940
it was one of those big ones that everybody kind of associates, you know, uh, with that.

02:09:37.940 --> 02:09:41.300
So, but I think that's, what's what the deal is with hacky sack in that case.

02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:45.380
So anyhow, um, all right, let's move on.

02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:48.340
Uh, we're gonna talk about what is coming out in stores this week.

02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:50.980
Uh, obviously it's going to be dying down a little bit.

02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:53.620
Although I don't know what smashes next week.

02:09:55.620 --> 02:09:58.020
So there, there's still stuff, you know, coming out this week.

02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:02.580
So we've got, um, you know, slowing down a little bit, not a whole ton.

02:10:02.580 --> 02:10:06.820
I mean like, okay, so like Darksiders three, that's a pretty decent release.

02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:09.220
That's on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:13.140
We have spin tires, mud runner, American wilds edition on the switch.

02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:15.140
Oh yeah. I'm sure we all have that pre-ordered.

02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:16.740
That's apparently a pretty good racing game.

02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:19.940
It's not so much racing. It's like an off-roading game.

02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:24.980
Um, I'll stop talking shit artifact, which is on PC, Mac and Linux.

02:10:24.980 --> 02:10:29.620
Um, Katsuie, Daphne, uh, Kizuna,

02:10:30.660 --> 02:10:33.780
Jigoku, Tachi on PlayStation four.

02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:34.580
It's a shoot them up.

02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:41.540
We have, um, Parkitect on PC, Mac and Linux, uh, persona Q2,

02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:46.340
new cinema labyrinth on 3DS arc survival evolved on the switch.

02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:50.900
And let's see fighting ex layer on PC.

02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:51.400
And that's it.

02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:52.340
Nice.

02:10:52.980 --> 02:10:53.220
All right.

02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:56.100
Traveling over to Japan, a few releases in Japan this week,

02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:58.420
obviously the calendar runs a little different over there.

02:10:58.420 --> 02:11:00.820
So we do have a few releases on the PlayStation four this week,

02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:06.100
including Katsuie Death Tiny, Kizuna, Jiko, Tachi comes out this week.

02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:09.700
Uh, Steel Rats, Million Arthur, Arcana Blood,

02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:14.100
and then Game Tengoku Cruise and Mix Special comes out in a regular

02:11:14.100 --> 02:11:17.540
and a limited edition called a Gokuraku Box,

02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:19.700
uh, comes out on the PlayStation four this week.

02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:24.580
Um, on the switch this week, a game called Lapis Re Abyss comes out this week,

02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:28.900
as well as Common Rider Climax Scramble ZO in a, uh,

02:11:28.980 --> 02:11:32.980
premium limited edition comes out, uh, this week in Japan as well.

02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:38.020
A game called Billion Road and Super Bomberman R gets a price reduction on the switch.

02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:39.460
If you still haven't checked that out.

02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:43.620
Also, I'm sure a lot of people, uh, wanting to check out Overcooked 2.

02:11:43.620 --> 02:11:46.660
If you're in Japan, you get your release of that game, which, um,

02:11:46.660 --> 02:11:49.220
I I've watched my buddy JD play those games a little bit,

02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:51.860
but I haven't really played them a lot myself, but I hear they're an awful lot of fun.

02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:53.620
So I probably need to spend more time with it.

02:11:53.620 --> 02:11:54.660
Hey, guess what?

02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:57.380
The Vita, the plug has not been pulled on the Vita yet.

02:11:57.380 --> 02:11:59.460
One release on the Vita in Japan this week.

02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:06.260
Beniro Tenjio Ayakashi Kitan Futai comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita.

02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:08.420
Uh, heading over to the UK, if you wouldn't mind, Loki.

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:08.740
All right.

02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:12.820
Dark Stars three is going to be coming out on PlayStation four and Xbox one.

02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:20.660
Asterix Xenoblax XXL two limited edition on PlayStation four, Xbox one and the switch

crash dummy on PlayStation four and the switch.

02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:26.100
What'd you call me?

02:12:27.540 --> 02:12:35.140
And a center in Kagura burst renewal on PlayStation four ride three on PlayStation

02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:38.820

02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:46.020

pro fishing simulator on PlayStation four and Xbox one.

02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:50.600
And that's it.

02:12:51.220 --> 02:12:51.620
All right.

02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:54.580
Let's get to the email because you guys send us emails and we love to read them.

02:12:57.380 --> 02:13:01.380
Also, I'll never get sick of this song.

02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:02.900
Still happy.

02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:05.780
We're still going to, we might change some of the music when we move over to Twitch,

02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:08.100
but I don't think I could ever get rid of journey to the Wonderland.

02:13:08.100 --> 02:13:09.060
I love this song too much.

02:13:09.060 --> 02:13:09.460
Yeah.

02:13:09.460 --> 02:13:09.780
All right.

02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:13.300
Anyway, uh, let's, uh, get to an email this week.

02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:17.460
The first one is from YYR who was just on this program for several minutes, but you

02:13:17.460 --> 02:13:19.220
know what to monopolize all the segments.

02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:19.700
You know what though?

02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:22.020
If you're going to give a game away for free on the show, I'm going to let you have

02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:22.660
all the time you want.

02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:23.380
So here you go.

02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:25.620
Actually, and there's some good, uh, there's some good thoughts and points in this

02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:26.740
email, so let's get to it.

02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:28.580
YYR send us an email.

02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:29.540
It says, hello, LR.

02:13:29.540 --> 02:13:31.460
Just a few thoughts on last week's episode.

02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:32.740
Rob, your suspicion was correct.

02:13:32.740 --> 02:13:36.500
The version of Tetris on NES that was created and published by Nintendo themselves was

02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:41.460
strictly a single player affair and had no multiplayer of any kind.

02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:46.580
Uh, it was also hot garbage compared to the far superior Tenken version, which is still

02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:50.820
to date the only console version of Tetris that has a co-op mode where two players position

02:13:50.820 --> 02:13:53.300
pieces in the same well at the same time.

02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:54.020
It's awesome.

02:13:54.020 --> 02:13:57.140
And everyone should try it out as at least once.

02:13:57.140 --> 02:14:00.660
You know what the NES version had, I swear to God, do you know what the NES version had

02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:05.780
that made it like that, that part of the reason why people remember it more so it's on

02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:06.660
the music.

02:14:06.660 --> 02:14:08.420
It's the music in the NES version.

02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:15.060
I'm telling you, you it's that, that song is still in this Tetris effect, 1989 skin.

02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:16.500
All it says is crazy.

02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:21.060
Anyway, not that I'm slamming Tengen Tetris because obviously I remember that that

02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:21.700
version.

02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:22.900
That's what I had thought last week.

02:14:23.780 --> 02:14:27.540
I thought people really desired that version of the game because it had something special

02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:29.300
that they took out of the Nintendo one.

02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:30.340
I thought it was multiplayer.

02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:32.580
And as it turns out, I was right.

02:14:33.780 --> 02:14:38.100
All right, on the subject of Microsoft and whether they should care about Japan, quite

02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:39.460
honestly, I don't think they should bother.

02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:44.900
They put in a lot of effort back in the 360 days, recruiting Japanese developers, producing

02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:47.460
exclusive JRPGs, and what did it get them?

02:14:47.460 --> 02:14:52.420
By the end of the generation, they still had only sold about 1.6 million 360s in Japan

02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:55.140
versus 10 million PlayStation threes.

02:14:55.140 --> 02:15:00.260
Worse yet, none of the momentum they had built carried over to the Xbox one, which is floundering

02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:02.740
there somewhere around the a hundred K mark.

02:15:02.740 --> 02:15:05.140
Yeah, but I think Microsoft like gave up.

02:15:05.140 --> 02:15:09.300
Like, I think honestly, a lot of those sales are like, you know how like people here will

02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:11.140
import stuff from Japan, like really?

02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:15.700
I think there are people players in Japan that will import stuff from America that they

02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:16.980
don't necessarily always get.

02:15:16.980 --> 02:15:19.540
Like a lot of the Western stuff that's developed over here.

02:15:19.540 --> 02:15:19.940
Possibly.

02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:20.420
Yeah.

02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:22.340
Things like Fortnite weren't developed in Japan.

02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:24.580
And there's probably people over there that want to play that type of stuff.

02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:27.700
I mean, that's a bad example because I'm sure there's a localized.

02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:31.380
I know what a World of Warcraft was.

02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:32.900
A big example that always has come up.

02:15:32.900 --> 02:15:34.580
They don't have World of Warcraft in Japan.

02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:38.820
That's that's another reason why Final Fantasy 14 has been able to succeed in many ways.

02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:39.700
It's not as big as WoW.

02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:44.260
I'm not trying to say that, but in Japan, it's bigger because WoW doesn't exist.

02:15:44.260 --> 02:15:45.460
So anyway, that's an example.

02:15:47.540 --> 02:15:48.500
Let's see, where was I?

02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:55.140
Oh, not to mention, console hardware sales in Japan have decreased literally every year

02:15:55.140 --> 02:16:00.740
since 2006, only increasing in 2017, mostly due to the launch of the Switch.

02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:04.420
I just feel like getting Japan to care about an Xbox console will be way too expensive

02:16:04.420 --> 02:16:06.260
and to justify the potential reward.

02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:09.540
Xbox remains popular in America and to a lesser extent, Europe.

02:16:09.540 --> 02:16:13.540
If game developers want to sell to this audience, regardless of where they're located, they

02:16:13.540 --> 02:16:15.940
can consider Xbox development and leave it at that.

02:16:15.940 --> 02:16:18.340
And for me, maybe that's what it comes down to.

02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:21.620
It's not even so much the fans as much as it is the developer.

02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:25.700
And granted, maybe my perspective is a little bit skewed because I tend to gravitate more

02:16:25.700 --> 02:16:27.700
towards the Japanese RPGs.

02:16:27.700 --> 02:16:31.300
Hell, this show was founded around a Japanese-based music game.

02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:34.100
So I think I just tend to gravitate towards those games.

02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:38.500
But even in the 16 years we've been doing Orange Launch Radio, I think we've seen a,

02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:40.660
you know, very like Japan market.

02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:42.260
Oh, well, our market.

02:16:42.820 --> 02:16:44.900
Well, that's a unique market to US market.

02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:48.260
Europe market has become more and more and more of a worldwide market.

02:16:48.260 --> 02:16:51.540
Hence why we don't have regions on the Switch anymore.

02:16:51.540 --> 02:16:53.380
And, you know, it's more becoming a thing.

02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:54.980
You just you don't have any systems.

02:16:54.980 --> 02:16:55.480
You know what I mean?

02:16:56.660 --> 02:17:03.540
Anyway, lastly, Loki mused about why Cruise and Blast hadn't come out on Switch.

02:17:03.540 --> 02:17:05.060
I think the reason is simple.

02:17:05.060 --> 02:17:10.420
It was developed by Raw Thrills, a company that exclusively develops arcade games.

02:17:10.420 --> 02:17:12.180
They don't do any work on consoles.

02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:16.420
So unless Nintendo contracts another developer to do the port, I don't think we'll ever see one.

02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:19.780
Thanks, as always, for the show and have a great week.

02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:21.380
Have fun YYR.

02:17:21.380 --> 02:17:24.100
Or any Cruise and Game because it's still Nintendo property.

02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:28.180
I mean, yeah, but those Raw Thrills, they do a lot of those arcade experiences.

02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:30.020
I feel like everything you see in arcade.

02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:31.300
That's exactly what I was gonna say.

02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:32.580
All the games are out there.

02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:33.700
It's like Raw Thrills.

02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:34.420
I mean, even they do.

02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:37.780
Hey, props to him for keeping it alive, honestly.

02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:40.900
Yeah, they're usually a big draw for a lot of the stuff there.

02:17:41.540 --> 02:17:45.300
Speaking of things that are alive and things that are not going to be alive much longer.

02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:49.060
Another thing that YYR brought up in chat earlier, Guitar Hero TV,

02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:52.260
that whole Guitar Hero online mode, that's gone December 1st.

02:17:52.820 --> 02:17:55.700
So, yeah, it's kind of shrugged my shoulders.

02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:58.420
It was like $5 at Target the other day.

02:17:58.420 --> 02:18:03.540
It's unfortunate that the music game Renaissance, like coming,

02:18:03.540 --> 02:18:07.620
like the Renaissance to the Renaissance, when Rock Band 4 and this new Guitar Hero,

02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:10.180
it's kind of sad that that kind of all hit with a whimper.

02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:14.980
It's not because of, I mean, it's, I understand it's a lot of is because it's

02:18:14.980 --> 02:18:19.300
expensive to license music and stuff, and so they have to monetize it and everything.

02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:23.620
But at the same time, I also feel like that it's Activision and they want to

02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:25.860
fucking monetize that into the fucking ground.

02:18:25.860 --> 02:18:31.300
So, you know, I don't feel entirely as bad.

02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:36.420
I just wish it was more of like, hey, we have original music a la like DJ Hero, you know?

02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:38.580
I don't know.

02:18:38.580 --> 02:18:45.300
Maybe those games need more original tracks in them and relied less on licensed stuff.

02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:46.580
Although license does sell.

02:18:47.220 --> 02:18:49.620
Act F points out Rock Band is still going as far as I know.

02:18:49.620 --> 02:18:54.420
But it's not, it's, it's, it's not dominating the conversation like it used to.

02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:56.340
You know, Rock Band 2 is the new thing.

02:18:56.340 --> 02:18:56.900
You know what I mean?

02:18:56.900 --> 02:19:00.580
It's kind of, it's, it's fallen back into the niche thing, which is, which is fine.

02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:01.140
But anyway.

02:19:01.940 --> 02:19:02.340
All right.

02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:03.540
Let's move on.

02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:04.260
More emails.

02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:06.420
Robert M emails us and says, welcome back.

02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:08.100
You seem to pick a heck of a week off.

02:19:08.820 --> 02:19:10.020
Not that it could have been planned.

02:19:10.020 --> 02:19:10.500
Yeah, it is.

02:19:10.500 --> 02:19:14.180
I've been saying for like, ever since I bought those tickets to the Fan Fest, I'm like, we're

02:19:14.180 --> 02:19:15.060
not going to be here that week.

02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:17.060
Weird question.

02:19:17.060 --> 02:19:22.340
With Incineroar in Smash Brothers Ultimate and Desuadeye in Pokken Tournament, do you

02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:24.580
think we'll see pre-Marinera?

02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:28.500
I always want to say pre-Marinera, but that's not what I was going to say.

02:19:28.500 --> 02:19:29.540
It's pre-Marina.

02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:31.220
Cause like a ocean.

02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:32.660
I always want to say pre-Marinera.

02:19:33.620 --> 02:19:36.500
Do you think we'll say pre-Marina and in what?

02:19:39.700 --> 02:19:45.300
It's honestly is my least favorite of the three starters, but I know pre-Marina has

02:19:45.300 --> 02:19:45.700
fans.

02:19:46.340 --> 02:19:47.140
So I don't know.

02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:50.740
Maybe in a Let's Go game in the future.

02:19:50.740 --> 02:19:51.380
I'll go with that.

02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:53.060
I'm going to go without the safe answer.

02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:56.820
Since you have the option to give you, gift you stuff via internet.

02:19:56.820 --> 02:20:01.300
So yeah, I don't know, but I get, well, the point Robert M is getting at is that you've

02:20:01.300 --> 02:20:02.740
got one fighting game over here.

02:20:02.740 --> 02:20:04.100
You got Pokken with Desuadeye.

02:20:04.100 --> 02:20:06.820
You got one fighting game over here with Incineroar, Smash Brothers.

02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:09.780
So where's the fighting game that pre-Marina is going to go in?

02:20:09.780 --> 02:20:10.660
You know what?

02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:11.780
They'll get an RPG.

02:20:13.140 --> 02:20:15.300
I guess, I guess Pokemon's an RPG.

02:20:15.300 --> 02:20:17.700
We don't know what the DLC is going to be yet.

02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:18.340
Yeah.

02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:18.740
You know what?

02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:22.660
Maybe, maybe in the future, you know, wait like 14 years from now and we'll get like

02:20:22.660 --> 02:20:26.900
Pokemon Let's Go pre-Marinera for your pasta.

02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:27.140
All right.

02:20:27.140 --> 02:20:33.700
Anyway, pre-Marinera noodles, pre-Marinera and noodles, just dry noodles and tangela.

02:20:33.700 --> 02:20:34.180
That's it.

02:20:34.180 --> 02:20:40.900
Pre it's, it's a match made in heaven pre-Marinera and tangela and tangela pops out of a box.

02:20:40.900 --> 02:20:42.500
I'm back, back, back again.

02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:42.820
All right.

02:20:42.820 --> 02:20:50.020
Anyway, um, also, do you think there will be representation of the sun and moon era in

02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:51.460
detective Pikachu?

02:20:51.460 --> 02:20:53.940
We never did get a chance to really talk about that trailer.

02:20:53.940 --> 02:20:55.140
The detective Pikachu trailer.

02:20:55.140 --> 02:20:55.700
Awesome.

02:20:55.700 --> 02:20:59.620
It was, I was, it was one of those things that I was kind of like, that's not what I

02:20:59.620 --> 02:21:03.300
expected at all, but I don't hate it.

02:21:04.020 --> 02:21:08.100
I was like, I kind of like the whole like Pokemon are real.

02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:10.100
You guys know they're real.

02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:12.180
Like they look real.

02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:15.060
They look furry when they shouldn't look furry.

02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:16.260
It's it's animals.

02:21:16.260 --> 02:21:17.700
They're supposed to be furry.

02:21:17.700 --> 02:21:18.580
I know, I know.

02:21:19.460 --> 02:21:20.180
They look weird.

02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:23.540
Anyway, um, let's see.

02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:27.540
And, uh, do you think there'll be representation, representation of that in detective Pikachu?

02:21:27.540 --> 02:21:28.420
I think so.

02:21:28.420 --> 02:21:32.660
I think even if it's just a little throw away, you know, the sun and moon still are the current

02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:33.300
games.

02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:37.140
And I don't think, I think gen eight will be a holiday release at this point.

02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:41.060
I think let's go seems to be doing well enough that it's kind of like Nintendo can kind of

02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:43.940
rest on that for an entire year till we get to next holiday.

02:21:43.940 --> 02:21:49.460
They're going to do like, let's go something that's going to be, I don't know, cross between

02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:54.740
the two, like no gen two, let's go Sentret and a Spinarak.

02:21:54.740 --> 02:21:55.460
I don't know.

02:21:55.460 --> 02:21:59.460
I'm just saying like, you know, cause they had, um, you know, they always do like, you

02:21:59.460 --> 02:22:01.860
know, red and blue and then, Oh, Hey, yellow.

02:22:01.860 --> 02:22:05.380
And it's like the two combined together or is that, well, let's go.

02:22:05.380 --> 02:22:08.580
Pikachu kind of is flat out a remake of yellow.

02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:13.300
And then all they did with let's go Eevee is they just kind of substituted Pikachu.

02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:16.900
Well, my understanding is, is, but it's not, it's not that you're playing this radically

02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:17.460
different game.

02:22:17.540 --> 02:22:19.380
It's just that you've got Eevee instead of Pikachu.

02:22:19.380 --> 02:22:23.220
And some of the ones you run across are different, but they're not like fundamentally different

02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:24.340
plots or anything like that.

02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:27.700
And were the other games fundamentally different?

02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:30.100
I just want to be clear before somebody calls me out on it.

02:22:30.100 --> 02:22:35.540
Let's go is also not really a directory make of yellow because the character of blue and

02:22:35.540 --> 02:22:37.220
I think red are in it.

02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:41.620
So it's kind of like you're going through the footsteps of what these characters went

02:22:41.620 --> 02:22:42.820
through 20 years ago.

02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:45.540
And plus it does have things like Alolan Pokemon.

02:22:45.540 --> 02:22:47.380
And I think I heard mega forms are in it too.

02:22:47.380 --> 02:22:47.860
Yes.

02:22:47.860 --> 02:22:50.020
Mega evolution, which didn't exist in gen one.

02:22:50.020 --> 02:22:55.380
So it's, it's very much like a remix, but it's most rooted in Pokemon.

02:22:55.380 --> 02:23:00.340
You get like the X and Y megas for like Mewtwo as well, which I'm assuming that's from X

02:23:00.340 --> 02:23:00.900
and Y.

02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:02.660
So that whole thing started.

02:23:02.660 --> 02:23:02.900
Yeah.

02:23:02.900 --> 02:23:04.180
X and Y was where that started.

02:23:04.180 --> 02:23:05.460
So six gen six.

02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:05.780
Yeah.

02:23:05.780 --> 02:23:07.620
So there's, it's all sorts of weird.

02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:09.620
And then Miltan, which is technically gen eight.

02:23:09.620 --> 02:23:11.220
So, you know, you have that in there too.

02:23:11.220 --> 02:23:11.700
Yeah.

02:23:11.700 --> 02:23:19.140
So, Oh, act deft also points out Eevee was the rival Pokemon in yellow because in the

02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:23.700
other games you had to pick Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, and your rival would always pick

02:23:23.700 --> 02:23:25.220
whatever was strong.

02:23:25.220 --> 02:23:30.340
Cause you know, Charmander beats a Bulbasaur beats Squirtle beats Charmander.

02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:33.380
So your rival would always pick whatever was strong.

02:23:33.380 --> 02:23:37.220
But since there isn't that in Pokemon yellow, your rival picks Eevee.

02:23:38.500 --> 02:23:40.180
So yeah.

02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:44.500
And I named my rival name because like, I was trying to think of something clever, but

02:23:44.500 --> 02:23:46.820
it was late and I, I didn't think of anything clever.

02:23:46.820 --> 02:23:48.580
So I just did a God of war meme.

02:23:48.580 --> 02:23:50.100
So his name is boy.

02:23:53.860 --> 02:23:55.300
My rival is Mr. Smoosh.

02:23:55.300 --> 02:23:56.020
Mr. Smoosh.

02:23:56.020 --> 02:23:57.460
Yeah, that's better than mine.

02:23:57.460 --> 02:23:58.340
I did it on stream.

02:23:58.340 --> 02:24:01.460
My kids, unprompted, did each other.

02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:02.900
So, you know, that's funny.

02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:05.700
That was kind of funny.

02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:08.340
But your rival's not really like your rival.

02:24:08.580 --> 02:24:13.620
Like, it's just like your little buddy that also wants to succeed and is always testing

02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:13.860
you.

02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:18.980
So anyway, here we, there, there we go back on our Pokemon bullshit, but that's, that's

02:24:18.980 --> 02:24:19.620
because of the email.

02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:20.340
I blame the email.

02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:25.060
Speaking of movie trailers though, you know, I got to digress for a minute.

02:24:25.060 --> 02:24:29.460
I got to ask about, cause y'all the Lion King, the Lion King.

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:31.380
What'd you think of that Lion King preview?

02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:32.820
That looked hot to me.

02:24:32.820 --> 02:24:34.180
Recycling their properties.

02:24:34.180 --> 02:24:35.620
I don't give a shit.

02:24:35.620 --> 02:24:37.300
Like it looks really good.

02:24:37.380 --> 02:24:39.860
It looks so like, well, here's the thing, like, honestly.

02:24:39.860 --> 02:24:40.100
Okay.

02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:45.940
Have you ever seen the Broadway show where it's like people in puppets, but it looks

02:24:45.940 --> 02:24:47.140
very classic.

02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:49.780
I thought that's what the movie was going to be.

02:24:49.780 --> 02:24:54.660
I thought the movie was going to be like people in puppet outfits, but it was done in a very

02:24:54.660 --> 02:24:57.860
like, like I know it sounds ridiculous when I say it, but if you've seen the Broadway

02:24:57.860 --> 02:25:00.740
show, it's very artistic and very well done.

02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:04.660
Like spoiler alert for a Broadway show that's been out there forever.

02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:10.820
When they start the Lion King, obviously it's the circle of life, you know, the big opening,

02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:11.060
right?

02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:12.500
Everybody fucking knows that song.

02:25:12.500 --> 02:25:15.060
If you've ever seen the Lion King in your life, that's the big song.

02:25:15.060 --> 02:25:19.860
So when you see it in the theater or in the, uh, in the Broadway theater, uh, or if it

02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:23.300
travels around, whatever, like not only do people come out on stage, but then all of

02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:25.060
a sudden people are coming down the aisles.

02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:28.820
You have these big giraffes and elephant puppets that come down the aisles and they're all

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:29.220
around you.

02:25:29.220 --> 02:25:32.420
And so it's like, everything is surrounding you and it's magnificent.

02:25:32.420 --> 02:25:34.100
It's like, holy shit.

02:25:34.100 --> 02:25:36.580
This is not like your normal type of play.

02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:41.780
So I thought the movie was going to be like the puppetry type of stuff because I thought

02:25:41.780 --> 02:25:45.300
when you hear live action, I didn't think it was just going to be, Oh, they're going

02:25:45.300 --> 02:25:48.580
to make everybody look like beast in beauty and the beast.

02:25:48.580 --> 02:25:48.820
Yeah.

02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:52.820
It's just like, it's just like the live action Aladdin that they're doing the live action.

02:25:52.820 --> 02:25:54.420
You know, now it's live action.

02:25:54.420 --> 02:25:56.260
I'm wondering though, are they going to incorporate?

02:25:56.260 --> 02:26:01.700
Cause wasn't, didn't they add like parts to the Broadway play that aren't in the, uh,

02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:05.140
yeah, like they do like an extra, they do some extra songs because they did that with

02:26:05.140 --> 02:26:06.420
beauty and the beast too.

02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:06.580
Yeah.

02:26:06.580 --> 02:26:09.060
But the interesting thing about the beauty and the beast remake is they didn't put in

02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:10.660
songs from the play.

02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:12.260
They just made up new songs.

02:26:12.260 --> 02:26:12.900
I thought they did.

02:26:12.900 --> 02:26:14.580
Oh, I thought it was the one from the play.

02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:15.380
No, they didn't.

02:26:15.380 --> 02:26:20.420
Uh, I know, like, I think there was a song in the movie called morning report that got

02:26:20.420 --> 02:26:22.580
cut and that is in the play.

02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:23.220
Right.

02:26:23.220 --> 02:26:25.060
So maybe it'll be in this live action movie.

02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:28.340
I don't think that's what I'm thinking because yeah, they did have a deleted song.

02:26:28.340 --> 02:26:29.060
Yeah.

02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:33.620
And in, um, in beauty and the beast, they deleted a song from the movie called human

02:26:33.620 --> 02:26:34.260
again.

02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:34.740
Yes.

02:26:34.740 --> 02:26:36.420
Which they put in the play.

02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:38.500
And I think that was in the movie though.

02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:39.940
I don't think they did it in the remake.

02:26:40.580 --> 02:26:41.780
I thought it was.

02:26:41.780 --> 02:26:43.620
It was not in the, not in the cartoon.

02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:46.500
Human again was not in the cartoon, but it was on like the Blu-ray.

02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:47.220
Yeah.

02:26:47.220 --> 02:26:47.940
Yeah.

02:26:47.940 --> 02:26:51.380
So, but I think it was in the remake.

02:26:51.380 --> 02:26:51.860
Was it?

02:26:51.860 --> 02:26:52.660
I don't know.

02:26:52.660 --> 02:26:54.580
I can't keep it all straight anymore.

02:26:54.580 --> 02:26:55.220
Jesus.

02:26:55.220 --> 02:26:55.620
All right.

02:26:55.620 --> 02:26:57.860
Anyway, who knew you were getting a movie show?

02:26:57.860 --> 02:26:58.820
All right, let's go.

02:26:58.820 --> 02:27:00.580
But again, I blame the emailer.

02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:02.420
This is what happens, but we love it.

02:27:02.420 --> 02:27:06.260
But you see now that we've asked about detective Pikachu and now we're talking about detective

02:27:06.260 --> 02:27:06.740
Pikachu.

02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:10.740
So like regarding that, so detective Pikachu, you know, like it was something that when

02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:14.580
I heard it was coming out, I was like, kind of, eh, I don't know if I want to see that,

02:27:14.580 --> 02:27:19.300
but then now I do want to see that now makes me kind of curious.

02:27:19.300 --> 02:27:21.300
Not necessarily like I'm jumping on board.

02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:24.500
Oh, by the way, and this is kind of segwaying into what I'm talking about here.

02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:29.860
So there was a cameo in Wreck-It Ralph 2, Sonic the Hedgehog explaining the Internet,

02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:33.780
which I thought was funny because, you know, Sonic the Hedgehog is very prevalent on social

02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:35.460
media and it's kind of funny like that.

02:27:35.460 --> 02:27:38.740
But anyway, speaking of Sonic the Hedgehog, so I'm kind of curious now to see the Sonic

02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:44.980
the Hedgehog live action trailer, which could be hot garbage, but Jim Carrey and I totally

02:27:44.980 --> 02:27:46.740
will see it because it has Jim Carrey in it.

02:27:46.740 --> 02:27:47.140
I know.

02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:48.020
All right.

02:27:48.020 --> 02:27:52.340
Which again, if people don't know where Loki comes from, it actually has nothing to do

02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:54.820
with the Marvel character, Loki.

02:27:54.820 --> 02:27:56.500
You got Loki from the mask, would you?

02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:57.380
It was from the mask.

02:27:57.380 --> 02:27:57.880
Yeah.

02:27:58.500 --> 02:28:00.420
Yes, because I am a fan of Jim Carrey.

02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:00.920
All right.

02:28:01.460 --> 02:28:02.180
I need to see his show.

02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:05.220
Yes, and I did see the Stan Lee cameo in Wreck-It Ralph 2 as well.

02:28:05.220 --> 02:28:05.720
All right.

02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:07.220
Anyhow, moving on.

02:28:07.220 --> 02:28:08.660
One more email from Robert M.

02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:13.060
I also see that for those who were understandably turned off by Animal Crossing Pocket Camp's

02:28:13.060 --> 02:28:17.460
loot box, fortune cookies, they're adding a cabin you can arrange your collected furniture

02:28:17.460 --> 02:28:17.860
in.

02:28:17.860 --> 02:28:20.580
So after one year, you can finally have a house.

02:28:21.460 --> 02:28:24.500
I don't know if you borrow bells from Dom Nook to expand it.

02:28:24.500 --> 02:28:28.180
I'm not quite as excited as for the Switch version, but very interested to see how this

02:28:28.180 --> 02:28:29.060
works out.

02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:33.860
Like, Robert M., with all respect, and I think you're saying you're in the same boat here.

02:28:33.860 --> 02:28:38.580
The minute they announced that Switch version, uninstalled Animal Crossing from my phone.

02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:39.220
Who cares?

02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:39.780
Who cares?

02:28:39.780 --> 02:28:40.580
Sorry.

02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:41.700
Good thing Jamie's not here.

02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:43.940
She kicked my ass because I'm sure she's still playing it.

02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:46.020
But who cares?

02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:47.540
We have a Switch version on the way.

02:28:47.540 --> 02:28:50.420
I got to prepare myself for that because it's going to be epic.

02:28:51.220 --> 02:28:51.940
All right.

02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:52.900
That's it for emails.

02:28:52.900 --> 02:28:53.940
You should send us emails.

02:28:53.940 --> 02:28:56.740
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:28:56.740 --> 02:28:59.940
But for now, we have some more stories before we get to the Skype line.

02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:03.380
We'll try to, we're going to try to kind of run through these stories to make sure we

02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:04.500
have plenty of time for Skype.

02:29:05.380 --> 02:29:06.340
So let's get to it.

02:29:06.340 --> 02:29:06.840
Loki.

02:29:07.780 --> 02:29:12.660
I know I'm going to talk to you about shortages and you know which company I'm talking about

02:29:12.660 --> 02:29:16.100
already when I say there's going to be a shortage of something.

02:29:16.100 --> 02:29:17.540
It's obviously Nintendo.

02:29:18.100 --> 02:29:22.820
And what did Nintendo not realize that they're going to have enough copies of?

02:29:22.820 --> 02:29:26.580
Well of course it's going to be the brand new Piranha Plant amiibo.

02:29:26.580 --> 02:29:30.580
It is sold out pretty much at every retailer in Japan.

02:29:31.140 --> 02:29:36.820
And which I guess the figure doesn't even come out until February 15th of next year.

02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:43.220
But they've already sold out of it and it's very hard to find apparently.

02:29:43.220 --> 02:29:45.140
And one way you can possibly get it.

02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:49.860
Well of course with all these deals online, Cyber Monday and whatnot.

02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:56.100
December 7th there's going to be a limited box set of 63 amiibos.

02:29:56.100 --> 02:30:00.820
All of the amiibos that I'm assuming that appear in the new Smash Brothers game.

02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:02.900
And you can purchase that.

02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:06.740
But there's only 50 of them and you can get that at Amazon Japan.

02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:08.020
It comes with a box and a poster.

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:10.420
It's a little excessive.

02:30:10.420 --> 02:30:12.100
I don't think I need that.

02:30:12.100 --> 02:30:16.260
I'm surprised to hear Piranha Plant is like crazy popular as it is though.

02:30:17.540 --> 02:30:20.820
When they first announced it I was like alright cool I guess.

02:30:21.540 --> 02:30:23.460
There's other characters I would have put in the game.

02:30:24.100 --> 02:30:26.660
Birdo, Wart, anything from Mario 2.

02:30:26.660 --> 02:30:28.820
But Piranha Plant okay whatever go off.

02:30:30.260 --> 02:30:32.580
I don't know I mean I guess we'll have to wait and see.

02:30:32.580 --> 02:30:34.420
I think you know just give it more time.

02:30:34.420 --> 02:30:37.780
I mean they're just I can't imagine they run too short of these amiibos.

02:30:37.780 --> 02:30:41.860
It's not that it's just a damn plastic figure with an RFID.

02:30:42.740 --> 02:30:45.380
Maybe because amiibos have been kind of slipping a little bit.

02:30:45.380 --> 02:30:47.300
Maybe the underestimated demand.

02:30:47.300 --> 02:30:47.860
You know what I mean?

02:30:47.860 --> 02:30:48.740
They still got time.

02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:52.340
I mean we're talking about a thing that comes out in February.

02:30:52.340 --> 02:30:54.180
So I mean they have time to make more.

02:30:54.180 --> 02:30:54.980
Get on it.

02:30:54.980 --> 02:30:55.480
All right.

02:30:56.420 --> 02:31:01.780
Rumors but we'll do it because it's coming from a reliable tech website called Throt.

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:05.940
And then via Eurogamer where we showed up on our radar.

02:31:05.940 --> 02:31:10.660
But Microsoft is apparently going to be launching a diskless version of the Xbox One

02:31:10.660 --> 02:31:12.180
in spring 2019.

02:31:12.180 --> 02:31:14.820
I also bring this up because this topic has come up before.

02:31:14.820 --> 02:31:15.620
Several times.

02:31:15.620 --> 02:31:19.940
This is a little deja vu but it's only gaining more and more steam.

02:31:19.940 --> 02:31:22.420
Which makes it look more and more true.

02:31:22.420 --> 02:31:23.860
So get used to this idea.

02:31:23.860 --> 02:31:27.220
I mean I'd have to see how much cheaper it would be but I don't know.

02:31:27.220 --> 02:31:29.620
Yeah well we'll see.

02:31:29.620 --> 02:31:32.660
Anyway the next gen Xbox is supposed to be in 2020.

02:31:32.660 --> 02:31:35.300
So this is a little bit kind of like a bridge.

02:31:35.300 --> 02:31:37.220
The code name for this device is Scarlet.

02:31:37.780 --> 02:31:41.060
They're saying it's going to be sold substantially lower than it is now.

02:31:41.060 --> 02:31:44.500
It could be as low as a hundred dollars cheaper.

02:31:45.380 --> 02:31:49.620
Pushing it at I guess under two hundred dollars US dollars.

02:31:50.820 --> 02:31:55.300
So I mean if they could get the price to a hundred dollars.

02:31:55.300 --> 02:31:57.380
I know that's asking a lot but that would be insane.

02:31:57.380 --> 02:32:01.860
Because like the Xbox One S was selling for 199 I think this week.

02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:04.340
You know during Black Friday and stuff.

02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:10.180
So you're thinking they need to get it down to like 149 to make it really.

02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:13.140
So Black Friday has kind of screwed perceptions in that regard.

02:32:13.140 --> 02:32:17.700
I mean I want to say yeah because yeah because they had yeah it was starting at 199.

02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:20.100
And they had like a game bundle and stuff like that.

02:32:20.100 --> 02:32:24.820
So it's just I don't want the S if I'm going to buy a system it's going to be yeah.

02:32:24.820 --> 02:32:29.700
Because they have the Minecraft one terabyte Minecraft creators bundle is 199.

02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:34.340
So they came with Minecraft and like some in-game currency and some other skins and stuff.

02:32:36.500 --> 02:32:40.420
And then they had the Xbox One X for like 399.

02:32:42.180 --> 02:32:47.780
Also Microsoft is apparently considering disk to digital which I feel like we've heard this one too.

02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:50.420
Meaning you can trade in a physical game in return for a digital

02:32:50.420 --> 02:32:52.420
download at certain participating retailers.

02:32:52.420 --> 02:32:56.900
That's kind of a big deal if that's really the case.

02:32:57.700 --> 02:33:00.100
That would be really the first of its kind to do that.

02:33:00.100 --> 02:33:00.820
To trade it in.

02:33:01.380 --> 02:33:04.500
And then I would assume that the company would be able to resell it.

02:33:04.500 --> 02:33:08.020
But how would you stop it for just getting traded back in over and over?

02:33:08.020 --> 02:33:10.340
Well I guess they don't give you as much money.

02:33:10.340 --> 02:33:12.180
You probably have to still pay some type of money or something.

02:33:12.180 --> 02:33:13.460
Probably some sort of redemption.

02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:17.140
It would be like for the retailer where they'd have to

02:33:17.140 --> 02:33:19.380
send it back to Microsoft to be destroyed or whatever.

02:33:19.380 --> 02:33:19.700
Maybe.

02:33:20.260 --> 02:33:21.380
I don't know it'll be interesting.

02:33:21.380 --> 02:33:27.140
Um, rumors still swelling about the next console.

02:33:27.140 --> 02:33:29.540
And whether it will have a disk drive or not.

02:33:29.540 --> 02:33:33.940
The next gen of Xbox may go diskless which deja vu.

02:33:33.940 --> 02:33:36.100
There was controversy at the beginning of Xbox One.

02:33:36.100 --> 02:33:36.900
It should still have a drive.

02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:42.580
People, speculation is that that's where Microsoft will ultimately fall.

02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:44.900
Is that the next console will still have a drive.

02:33:45.540 --> 02:33:49.540
But I don't think it would be as damning as it was this last time.

02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:52.420
Because more and more people are going to why it's not necessary.

02:33:52.420 --> 02:33:56.820
And I I'm on the fence like I purchased most of my stuff digitally.

02:33:56.820 --> 02:33:57.860
And yeah I get it.

02:33:57.860 --> 02:34:04.580
You know it's but then again I just got an Xbox or not an Xbox PlayStation 4 Pro.

02:34:04.580 --> 02:34:09.140
And so a lot of the like I haven't really been downloading a lot of the 4k content.

02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:16.900
So for me like I would think one of the draws I with the 4k um like a ultra HD Blu-ray drive

02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:22.500
would be you know I would want to have those on disk versus downloading that stuff.

02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:26.740
Because that's several you know gigabytes worth of data for movies.

02:34:26.740 --> 02:34:29.540
And the hard drives that are in these you know like one terabyte.

02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:33.300
It's all right for now but that's going to fill up really fast.

02:34:33.300 --> 02:34:38.660
Especially when you have games like Fallout 76 with like oh hey it's a 4k textures.

02:34:38.660 --> 02:34:40.820
Like yeah are like 90 gigabyte games.

02:34:40.820 --> 02:34:46.100
So unless you like start plopping like 50 or like five terabyte drives in there.

02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:53.860
And you know convince all the internet providers to not give me a you know download cap.

02:34:53.860 --> 02:34:56.260
Then then yeah maybe that might work.

02:34:56.260 --> 02:35:02.660
But I think until technology elsewhere catches up you're going to have to include a drive in there.

02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:06.580
Like well it may be that you're skewing more towards digital downloads.

02:35:06.580 --> 02:35:07.380
That's cool.

02:35:07.380 --> 02:35:09.380
That's more money in your pocket honestly.

02:35:09.380 --> 02:35:14.900
Because you're not having to sell you know physical copies of retailers and take a cut out of it.

02:35:14.900 --> 02:35:20.340
But at the same time that's still going to be a part of it.

02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:22.820
I mean and I'm I'm still going to buy physical games.

02:35:22.820 --> 02:35:25.780
Especially if I find out like oh hey I've got to download like

02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:29.780
100 gigabytes that's going to be on the disk or something like that.

02:35:29.780 --> 02:35:32.100
And I don't I don't think anyone should like you know freak out.

02:35:32.100 --> 02:35:33.620
Because again these are rumors.

02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:37.380
But I think this is exactly the type of conversation Microsoft is trying to feel out.

02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:41.780
Like is the gamer base ready to be diskless or do we still need to kind of have the disk.

02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:43.780
And I think I think ultimately they will fall on the side.

02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:48.260
I don't think it would be like I mean honestly like I don't watch a lot Ultra HD content

02:35:49.140 --> 02:35:51.780
yet because I don't have anything that will play it.

02:35:51.780 --> 02:35:57.940
I mean I could get digital copies for my PlayStation 4 but I just don't want to buy those.

02:35:57.940 --> 02:35:58.440
Yeah.

02:35:58.980 --> 02:35:59.780
So I don't know.

02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:01.060
All right well let's move on.

02:36:02.340 --> 02:36:05.220
Since Microsoft's got a clear shot next E3 we'll see.

02:36:05.780 --> 02:36:06.280
Yeah.

02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:13.300
So apparently there is UK commission that was looking at gambling in games.

02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:20.100
So they're put out a report that talked about loot boxes.

02:36:20.100 --> 02:36:23.620
And you know according to the commission says the gambling commissions

02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:28.020
takes the view of the ability to convert in-game items to cash

02:36:28.580 --> 02:36:34.180
or to trade them for other items of value means that they attain a real world value

02:36:34.180 --> 02:36:37.220
and become articles of money or money's worth.

02:36:37.220 --> 02:36:43.140
Whereas gambling facilitates or facilities are offered to British consumers

02:36:43.140 --> 02:36:48.420
including with those with the use of in-game or in-game items

02:36:48.420 --> 02:36:53.780
that can be converted in the cash or traded for items value a gambling license is required.

02:36:53.780 --> 02:36:58.980
So they do see these loot boxes as you know gambling.

02:36:58.980 --> 02:37:02.580
And even with that they said you know that they found that that 39 percent

02:37:02.580 --> 02:37:10.020
of UK children 11 to 16 spend their or have spent their own money gambling.

02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:12.500
14 percent had done so within the last week.

02:37:13.620 --> 02:37:23.060
They said that the average amount spent during that time was 16 looks like 16 60 or 16 euro.

02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:29.780
And then 60 percent of young people believe that their parents would wouldn't want them gambling.

02:37:29.780 --> 02:37:33.220
19 percent claimed that they guardians had strict rules against gambling.

02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:38.180
So they're actually talking about like actually gambling gambling not necessarily

02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:40.420
that they purchase loot boxes or something like that.

02:37:40.420 --> 02:37:44.820
But they see that because of this being more prevalent in games.

02:37:44.820 --> 02:37:49.060
There's a correlation with gambling going up you know.

02:37:51.940 --> 02:37:56.100
So it's it's interesting to see that and I think with other companies like you know

02:37:56.980 --> 02:38:02.500
Belgium whatever blocking some of these we interest to see how it goes.

02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:06.500
And I know that like some of these companies like EA have said well we're just not comply

02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:12.020
with the laws you know you block it we're just not going to do it which makes you think you know like

02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:17.460
wow they're really they're willing to break the law to sell this stuff.

02:38:18.020 --> 02:38:22.340
I mean that's a lot because they're still convinced in their mind that it's not

02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:24.100
what these companies are saying it is.

02:38:24.100 --> 02:38:26.260
They're going to have to get dragged to court to stop doing.

02:38:26.260 --> 02:38:28.100
Yeah it's just like ultimately they'll just stop releasing.

02:38:28.100 --> 02:38:31.060
It's just like cigarette companies saying that cigarettes weren't addictive.

02:38:31.060 --> 02:38:32.660
I mean come on it's the same thing.

02:38:32.660 --> 02:38:33.860
They know what they're doing.

02:38:33.860 --> 02:38:35.700
So it's just I don't know.

02:38:36.820 --> 02:38:37.620
All right.

02:38:37.620 --> 02:38:42.340
Well while we wait to see what shapes up with that legally moving on to a lot of talk about

02:38:42.340 --> 02:38:46.660
accessibility in the gaming industry this week as there's been several different reports kind

02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:52.020
of concerning accessibility with some recent titles including the Spyro Reignited trilogy.

02:38:52.580 --> 02:39:01.700
Apparently it does lack subtitles in the Spyro Reignited trilogy and there are no subtitles.

02:39:01.700 --> 02:39:06.340
So you know people that you need to rely on subtitles are a little bit irritated about this.

02:39:06.340 --> 02:39:07.380
I'd like to use subtitles.

02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:09.620
At least that's something that they could probably patch in.

02:39:09.620 --> 02:39:10.900
So that's not such a big deal.

02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:14.020
Yeah but it is also one of the things they shouldn't have to patch.

02:39:14.020 --> 02:39:15.460
It shouldn't have done it out the gate right.

02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:19.380
But yeah I even like I don't consider myself

02:39:20.100 --> 02:39:23.220
disabled when it comes to like needing the subtitles.

02:39:23.220 --> 02:39:27.780
But like I'm definitely like because I get really distracted by like background noise.

02:39:27.780 --> 02:39:30.820
Like if I'm in a restaurant or something I have to really focus on

02:39:30.820 --> 02:39:32.660
who's talking to me and what they're saying.

02:39:32.660 --> 02:39:36.020
Because a lot of times I will get so easily distracted by noise around me.

02:39:36.020 --> 02:39:38.180
Like I'm not necessarily like trying to eavesdrop on conversations.

02:39:38.180 --> 02:39:41.060
But like I can't like I just I can't focus on one conversation.

02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:42.740
It's what happens the background noise.

02:39:42.740 --> 02:39:47.380
So sometimes with like even playing games and stuff like that.

02:39:47.380 --> 02:39:49.860
Like all of that other noise gets in the way of the dialogue.

02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:51.220
And I have a hard time understanding.

02:39:51.220 --> 02:39:53.140
So I prefer to play with subtitles.

02:39:53.140 --> 02:39:55.780
I actually prefer to watch movies with closed captions too.

02:39:56.660 --> 02:40:00.660
I will go to the theater and watch them without and be all right.

02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:03.140
But I prefer when I'm at home to watch with closed captions.

02:40:03.140 --> 02:40:05.300
And you know some people get really annoyed with that.

02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:07.140
Because it's like when you're just reading them.

02:40:07.140 --> 02:40:11.620
But I'm sorry it's just like I miss too much shit if I don't have it on.

02:40:11.620 --> 02:40:14.260
Yeah so and I do this with games.

02:40:14.260 --> 02:40:17.140
I far prefer to have the subtitles on in games.

02:40:17.620 --> 02:40:25.540
So yeah anyway apparently Activision did provide a statement to the blog Game Pit.

02:40:25.540 --> 02:40:29.060
Who said when Toys for Bob set out to make an awesome game collection.

02:40:29.060 --> 02:40:31.780
There were certain decisions that needed to be made throughout the process.

02:40:31.780 --> 02:40:36.500
The team remained committed to keep the integrity and legacy of Spyro that fans remembered intact.

02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:38.660
While there's no industry standard for subtitles.

02:40:38.660 --> 02:40:41.140
The studio and Activision care about the fans experience.

02:40:41.140 --> 02:40:44.580
Especially with respect to accessibility for people with different abilities.

02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:46.180
And will evaluate going forward.

02:40:47.620 --> 02:40:50.020
Kind of a shit answer in my opinion.

02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:52.260
They're trying to say well since the first game didn't have subtitles.

02:40:52.820 --> 02:40:54.260
That's kind of like what they're saying basically.

02:40:54.980 --> 02:40:56.420
Kind of a shit answer.

02:40:56.420 --> 02:40:58.260
I think that could have been worded a lot better.

02:40:58.260 --> 02:41:03.140
Just basically like instead they could have just kind of fessed up and said.

02:41:03.140 --> 02:41:06.820
You know since we they weren't in the original game.

02:41:06.820 --> 02:41:08.900
And we remastered the first game.

02:41:08.900 --> 02:41:10.420
We neglected to include it.

02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:12.340
But we are looking to include it in the future.

02:41:12.340 --> 02:41:14.900
To make sure that our games are as accessible as possible.

02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:17.380
I think there could have been a better way they could have worded that.

02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:20.580
Maybe took a little bit of ownership.

02:41:20.580 --> 02:41:24.260
But they did not with that statement in my humble opinion.

02:41:25.220 --> 02:41:27.220
SSJ100Matt agrees with me in chat.

02:41:27.220 --> 02:41:28.180
That is a shit answer.

02:41:29.060 --> 02:41:32.180
Anyway also Pokemon Let's Go.

02:41:32.180 --> 02:41:34.900
Getting some pushback on the motion controls.

02:41:34.900 --> 02:41:37.300
Because the motion controls in the game are mandatory.

02:41:37.300 --> 02:41:40.660
So of course that means that players with certain disabilities can't play.

02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:44.500
I have only been playing with the Joy-Con to like throw the ball.

02:41:44.580 --> 02:41:48.020
I have not played in portable mode at all.

02:41:48.020 --> 02:41:49.540
I have played all in portable mode.

02:41:49.540 --> 02:41:50.420
That's so interesting.

02:41:50.420 --> 02:41:54.180
Because to me I think that's one of the reasons why I love this game.

02:41:54.180 --> 02:41:55.940
More than like any other Pokemon game.

02:41:55.940 --> 02:41:58.740
Is because I can play it on the fucking television finally.

02:41:59.380 --> 02:42:00.900
And that means a lot for me.

02:42:00.900 --> 02:42:02.660
So I like to play with the motion controls.

02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:04.420
But regardless of how I feel.

02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:09.620
There's you know some gamers out there that are are not able to do that motion.

02:42:09.620 --> 02:42:11.140
Or the gyro motion.

02:42:11.140 --> 02:42:14.180
I'm gonna throw in a few life hacks here for you for Pokemon.

02:42:14.740 --> 02:42:15.620
Let's go as well.

02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:16.020
All right.

02:42:16.020 --> 02:42:19.060
So here's some fun little cheats or stuff you can do.

02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:25.060
So because in the game you can have anybody join up with you with your Pokemon at any time.

02:42:25.060 --> 02:42:28.420
You can actually when you're fighting trainers and stuff like that.

02:42:28.420 --> 02:42:30.340
And you find a difficult battle.

02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:32.660
You activate the other controller by shaking it.

02:42:32.660 --> 02:42:35.700
Then you get to have two Pokemon out at once versus their one.

02:42:37.700 --> 02:42:38.580
At the same time.

02:42:38.900 --> 02:42:40.900
Hmm so anyway.

02:42:41.780 --> 02:42:43.220
Apparently yeah.

02:42:44.100 --> 02:42:48.020
Because you have to use some of the gyro even when you're in portable mode.

02:42:48.020 --> 02:42:48.580
Yeah you do.

02:42:48.580 --> 02:42:52.420
It sucks for people that can't like pick that up and hold it and do the whole thing.

02:42:52.420 --> 02:42:55.780
So you know Nintendo's kind of getting called out on that a little bit.

02:42:56.580 --> 02:42:59.220
But there's also some positive examples.

02:42:59.220 --> 02:43:01.460
Eurogamer kind of spotlighted amongst all this.

02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:07.300
Spider-Man PlayStation 4 has a lot of great accessibility features in it.

02:43:07.300 --> 02:43:10.260
For example you can you know change things like parallaxing.

02:43:10.260 --> 02:43:12.020
You can make subtitles gigantic.

02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:14.980
You can do quick time events that auto complete.

02:43:14.980 --> 02:43:18.260
You can change button taps to hold like you can really break it down.

02:43:18.260 --> 02:43:22.500
And other games have been called out for doing accessibility right.

02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:27.140
God of War, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Celeste are all games that really kind of go out of

02:43:27.140 --> 02:43:29.540
their way to be more and more accessible.

02:43:29.540 --> 02:43:34.100
So you know certainly something I think we just need to be thinking about developing

02:43:34.100 --> 02:43:37.860
games is how can as many people as possible play this game.

02:43:37.860 --> 02:43:38.820
You know what I mean.

02:43:38.820 --> 02:43:42.180
There's I think it's going to be tough like when it comes to things like VR.

02:43:42.900 --> 02:43:46.020
Like some people just aren't going to be able to do VR period.

02:43:46.020 --> 02:43:47.300
Yeah you know what I mean.

02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:52.420
So it's it's tough like you have to kind of ask these hard questions about well you know

02:43:52.420 --> 02:43:55.780
how how far can we go to actually be able to include people.

02:43:55.780 --> 02:44:00.580
You know in like a game like Beat Saber it's going to be very very very hard to make inclusive.

02:44:01.220 --> 02:44:01.780
You know what I mean.

02:44:02.580 --> 02:44:05.540
But I think again you just kind of have to put the question in the back of your mind.

02:44:06.580 --> 02:44:11.300
How can we easily incorporate as many people as possible to be able to enjoy this game.

02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:12.820
And subtitles come on.

02:44:12.820 --> 02:44:14.180
That's an easy thing.

02:44:14.180 --> 02:44:15.540
Like that's super easy.

02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:20.580
Button remapping that should be like a non-issue easy easy peasy thing which is why it's built

02:44:20.580 --> 02:44:22.900
into PlayStation firmware at this point right.

02:44:22.900 --> 02:44:24.500
You know so anyway.

02:44:25.380 --> 02:44:27.140
All right well let's move on.

02:44:27.140 --> 02:44:29.780
We got a couple more stories for you guys that we're going to open up the Skype line

02:44:29.780 --> 02:44:32.820
if anyone wants to call in at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:33.380 --> 02:44:35.620
But first Loki.

02:44:35.620 --> 02:44:37.780
We've got new Half-Life coming out.

02:44:37.780 --> 02:44:39.300
Fan-made Half-Life of course.

02:44:39.300 --> 02:44:45.140
So there was a whole remake of the original Half-Life called Black Mesa which came out

02:44:45.140 --> 02:44:46.020
not too long ago.

02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:54.260
And of course with that there was still the last part of the game which is set on the

02:44:54.260 --> 02:44:55.380
Alien World of Xen.

02:44:55.940 --> 02:45:01.220
So now the Black Mesa team has released a trailer for Black Mesa Xen which is going

02:45:01.220 --> 02:45:07.540
to be the final chapter of the game which is set to be released around the second quarter

02:45:07.540 --> 02:45:08.340
of next year.

02:45:08.340 --> 02:45:09.540
And it looks fantastic.

02:45:10.260 --> 02:45:11.380
It looks so great.

02:45:12.100 --> 02:45:19.620
So you know since it's largely original work it says it'll run for about six hours and

02:45:19.620 --> 02:45:20.340
very colorful.

02:45:20.340 --> 02:45:27.540
I will have to ask Alan if he plans to play that because he you know he'll visit the Half-Life

02:45:27.540 --> 02:45:28.820
series about once a year or so.

02:45:28.820 --> 02:45:29.860
He's still on his Dark Souls.

02:45:29.860 --> 02:45:31.300
I'm sure he's played Black Mesa.

02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:35.540
Oh he has he has but if they're gonna like finally do that you know last sequence and

02:45:35.540 --> 02:45:37.780
everything he'll probably go back and revisit so.

02:45:37.780 --> 02:45:39.060
Yeah it looks pretty amazing.

02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:43.940
Yeah and then last but certainly not least tonight I mean this is one of those things

02:45:43.940 --> 02:45:48.260
where hello I think everybody heard this news already but we have to mention of course at

02:45:48.260 --> 02:45:54.100
some point that Stan Lee who you know contributed so much to nerd culture you know obviously

02:45:54.100 --> 02:45:58.980
through Marvel Comics which of course expanded into the video game universe did pass away

02:45:58.980 --> 02:46:01.780
while we were out on break at the age of 95.

02:46:02.500 --> 02:46:09.460
So he did pass away on Monday the what was the date the 20th just right after I think

02:46:09.460 --> 02:46:10.500
the last Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:11.140 --> 02:46:17.940
He passed away it was November 12th I think was the day and he was 95 years old though

02:46:17.940 --> 02:46:22.980
so what an amazing life I think many of us would be so fortunate to lead such an amazing

02:46:22.980 --> 02:46:23.620
life.

02:46:23.620 --> 02:46:28.420
Stan Lee of course behind heroes like Spider-Man the Fantastic Four the Incredible Hulk and

02:46:28.420 --> 02:46:32.660
so on and you know he did do a lot for video games as well.

02:46:32.660 --> 02:46:38.260
It's not you know just certainly Marvel or not just comics because Spider-Man's PlayStation

02:46:38.260 --> 02:46:41.540
4 games he made appearances in Lego Marvel series.

02:46:41.540 --> 02:46:44.820
He showed up in the amazing Spider-Man Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:49.700
He actually made a cameo in DC Teen Titans goes yeah the movie believe it was hilarious.

02:46:49.700 --> 02:46:54.020
So I mean that's cool that you know you can you know you have a little little love between

02:46:54.020 --> 02:46:59.700
you know the fact that he had a well he had a cameo but it wasn't like a spoken cameo

02:46:59.700 --> 02:47:02.020
it was just kind of like a little easter egg they threw in there.

02:47:02.020 --> 02:47:08.740
Yeah so anyhow it was it was video games as well as music and I'm sure is music as well

02:47:08.740 --> 02:47:16.180
as comics and movies and yeah I'm sure a lot of folks very sad to hear that but again

02:47:16.180 --> 02:47:21.220
95 what a wonderful long great life and I know many people had seen him at conventions

02:47:21.220 --> 02:47:24.100
he was doing those conventions man right up to the last year.

02:47:24.100 --> 02:47:28.500
I remember he was at Dragon Con just a couple years ago he had a he had a floor auto himself

02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:32.740
at Dragon Con but when you're Stan Lee that's what you get so rest in peace Stan Lee.

02:47:33.540 --> 02:47:37.940
Let's open up the skype line Orange Lounge Radio all one word on skype if you want to

02:47:37.940 --> 02:47:41.060

Hello you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

That's the one and only Ron how is everybody tonight?

02:48:09.140 --> 02:48:10.500
Hey I'm great how are you doing?

02:48:11.140 --> 02:48:14.980
Pretty good after a little chaos during Black Friday sales I can't complain.

02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:19.460
Yeah you know I didn't go out there I mean I went out to go play video games but I didn't

02:48:19.460 --> 02:48:24.180
I didn't fight any of the traffic at malls or things like that on Black Friday I just kind of

02:48:24.180 --> 02:48:29.300
I kind of uh it was a normal day for well I had to work on Black Friday I don't even I don't work

02:48:29.300 --> 02:48:34.740
retail or any of that stuff I mean you brave souls that do uh but I work an office job but

02:48:34.740 --> 02:48:37.780
just the nature of my industry we had to be open on Friday so.

02:48:37.780 --> 02:48:40.340
Well that's understandable so I get that.

02:48:40.340 --> 02:48:43.700
So it's just another day for me but how was how was your weekend adventure with

02:48:43.700 --> 02:48:44.820
all that getting any good deals?

02:48:45.700 --> 02:48:49.460
Uh that's Spider-Man PlayStation 4 for $200 my dude.

02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:51.780
So how are you liking PlayStation 4?

02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:59.060
I just hooked it up it's as it's updating you open the Skype license I kind of did a backflip

02:48:59.060 --> 02:49:00.820
from my TV over to the chair.

02:49:02.660 --> 02:49:04.420
So a little too early to tell huh?

02:49:04.980 --> 02:49:09.620
Yes despite the drama behind me getting it I I'm good.

02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:14.580
Um so you picked up not just the Spider-Man that's included right but I saw because you

02:49:14.580 --> 02:49:18.020
you gave me a shout out on Twitter thank you because you picked up Tetris Effect right?

02:49:18.020 --> 02:49:18.820
Yes I did.

02:49:18.820 --> 02:49:22.980
Yeah well and where's my kickback from enhanced games where's that all right uh and then you

02:49:22.980 --> 02:49:25.940
picked up one other thing too right the Kingdom Hearts thing right?

02:49:25.940 --> 02:49:30.340
And I actually traded in the Spider-Man game and got um Dragon Quest 11.

02:49:31.220 --> 02:49:34.260
That's fun oh so you didn't even want the Spider-Man game?

02:49:35.620 --> 02:49:39.140
For giving me reasons I'm like you have to understand something.

02:49:39.140 --> 02:49:45.780
I have a very eclectic taste in video games like I can't stand a lot of RTS type games

02:49:45.780 --> 02:49:50.820
but I can sit there and play Command and Conquer the Age of Series the Project Crow I can sit

02:49:50.820 --> 02:49:55.380
there play those all day I'll stare at Final Fantasy Tactics go two rounds like I'm done

02:49:55.380 --> 02:49:59.140
with this all right very eclectic taste.

02:49:59.140 --> 02:50:03.380
That's why I consider myself pretty eclectic when it comes to games too but you know there's

02:50:03.380 --> 02:50:07.140
certain things that I'm just never gonna gel with like Call of Duty but even then like

02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:09.220
I watch other people play it and I go this is pretty.

02:50:09.940 --> 02:50:13.620
I will sit there and play Battlefield I picked up Battlefield because it was free I'm like

02:50:13.620 --> 02:50:18.180
I won't pay $60 for it I might pay $10 but you know free free is free.

02:50:18.180 --> 02:50:18.900
Yeah free is free.

02:50:20.740 --> 02:50:26.020
I didn't want to go on about uh my PS4 I'm just here to back up a lot of what you said

02:50:26.020 --> 02:50:32.660
about E3 okay I'm walking home I'm screaming to the world that you are preaching the gospel

02:50:32.660 --> 02:50:38.340
about E3 and PAX and all of that I'm like this is part of the reason why I stopped going to PAX.

02:50:39.220 --> 02:50:43.460
And you care to elaborate what do you what do you think I got right on this?

02:50:44.180 --> 02:50:51.220
It's not fun anymore PAX was fan run now it's industry run I have heard from people that

02:50:51.220 --> 02:50:57.780
you can't get as much free swag anymore it's harder to get badges it's more of a glorified

02:50:57.780 --> 02:51:04.020
dealers hall than anything else I mean with the way technology is going the fact that Sony's

02:51:04.020 --> 02:51:08.900
off doing their own thing it's not surprising everybody else is plus the fact that you have

02:51:08.900 --> 02:51:13.860
like smaller gaming conventions popping up and indie companies are going to and sometimes you

02:51:13.860 --> 02:51:19.940
might find a third-party company going to showing stuff off and also let's say there is this awesome

02:51:19.940 --> 02:51:26.260
game coming out at E3 and you have to be one of the elite few to try it out you ain't got to worry

02:51:26.260 --> 02:51:33.700
about that because if you wait a few weeks that company Sony EA whoever will be at New York comic

02:51:33.700 --> 02:51:38.340
con with the game and you can hop on the line and play it then or this convention where you can hop

02:51:38.340 --> 02:51:42.100
on the line and play it then or you just watch it all on YouTube we don't even have to wait at all.

02:51:43.220 --> 02:51:50.660
Exactly I mean I had a friend who was all hyped about going to E3 last year she hasn't mentioned

02:51:50.660 --> 02:51:57.060
anything about going this year because even though they opened it up to the general public

02:51:57.060 --> 02:52:03.940
a lot of convention goers are not used to have E3 runs yes I'm gonna go to like comic cons

02:52:03.940 --> 02:52:10.340
and and other stuff where it kind of closes at eight you saw panels going on like 10 o'clock

02:52:10.340 --> 02:52:18.580
oh yeah but E3 there really is no panels it's just rows of demos and other stuff and then it's over

02:52:18.580 --> 02:52:22.820
you can find your friends or see if you can get into an industry party or something like that

02:52:22.820 --> 02:52:27.860
you know even this Final Fantasy thing was over at six o'clock Friday and Saturday so it was

02:52:27.860 --> 02:52:31.380
no more like eight o'clock because the concerts but still kind of left that whole evening where

02:52:31.380 --> 02:52:34.500
it's like well what do we do now oh well at least we're in Las Vegas and we can hang with

02:52:34.500 --> 02:52:40.660
our guildies you know what I mean so there's that so you know I do I do want to point out

02:52:40.660 --> 02:52:46.340
though just just to be clear you know you know the moment when E3 I kind of had my aha moment about

02:52:46.340 --> 02:52:50.100
I'm not sure this is worth the money to come down here and take off work for this anymore you know

02:52:50.100 --> 02:52:56.500
when the moment was well it was the year the last year I went when we were basically we had to

02:52:56.500 --> 02:53:03.140
justify ourselves as a legitimate press outlet to get tickets to this Assassin's Creed theater

02:53:03.140 --> 02:53:10.020
experience wait in line once we have tickets to get in the Assassin's Creed thing finally watch

02:53:10.020 --> 02:53:14.340
the thing which looked neat I was you know I'm not even a huge Assassin's Creed person and I was like

02:53:14.340 --> 02:53:20.980
oh I was into it and then come to find out the whole thing's on YouTube already so that thing I

02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:26.340
had to fight and wait in line for it was just there on YouTube going to see it Rob you see it

02:53:26.340 --> 02:53:31.780
right now but I'm rolling my eyes so hard in the back of my head about that I'm like are you fucking

02:53:31.780 --> 02:53:37.780
kidding but that's that's the reality of you know a big piece of where E3 kind of lost its luster

02:53:37.780 --> 02:53:42.260
where I'm like again if I could just watch this on YouTube why am I coming down here to spend all

02:53:42.260 --> 02:53:49.220
this money you know it's that's what it is and the fact that it's just crowds and you know I

02:53:49.220 --> 02:53:57.060
already said it if I have to take personal time off to sit in front of my computer to get my

02:53:57.060 --> 02:54:05.460
tickets my hotel rooms if I gotta get a squad together to do that that's it to me the convention

02:54:05.460 --> 02:54:12.900
is not worth going through that for I refuse yeah so and Bobby kind of says in chat you know kind

02:54:12.900 --> 02:54:17.380
of a hits home type of comment I gave up on E3 when they told me I wasn't legit anymore even

02:54:17.380 --> 02:54:22.340
with my LLC in my audience I got tired of fighting Pax said the same thing to me and I gave up on them

02:54:22.340 --> 02:54:29.540
too but I remember when Bobby put together at Pax the little indie podcast alley one year at Pax

02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:34.020
that was through the whole all games thing that we had one year when we were with them

02:54:34.020 --> 02:54:44.020
so it's crazy to me how like that attitude is gone see you know I feel you I used to be able

02:54:44.020 --> 02:54:51.220
to do press for Comic-Con but as it would more industry when they denied me I said it ain't worth

02:54:51.220 --> 02:54:58.260
it they told me I did not have enough hits on my site for them to give me a press pass and it's not

02:54:58.260 --> 02:55:02.260
like it's not like I don't want to make this clear because I don't want people being like oh they're

02:55:02.260 --> 02:55:06.500
whining or it's the ego or something like that it's not really that but it's this whole thing

02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:11.140
where it's like well if you don't want me why am I going to bother going and I just I get so much

02:55:11.140 --> 02:55:17.140
more out of fan run expos that's why I love Dragon Con fan run magfest was a lot of fun fan fan run

02:55:17.140 --> 02:55:23.380
like I'm just getting more rewards being a loud ass fan which I think is a good way to describe

02:55:23.380 --> 02:55:32.020
a podcaster or a twitch streamer a loud ass fan exactly we tend to succeed at fan cons oh speaking

02:55:32.500 --> 02:55:35.780
let me tell you this quick story let me get out of here there's a small local convention

02:55:36.500 --> 02:55:42.340
I kind of had a I guess a one-sided argument with them they denied me press I'm just like can you

02:55:42.340 --> 02:55:47.620
tell me the reason why because I like to know why that way I can fix things for the following year

02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:55.780
learn from that you know they told me that my press site wasn't good enough because we're not

02:55:55.780 --> 02:56:03.060
like the local newspaper or the tv station I'm sorry abc is not going to send a newsman to your

02:56:03.060 --> 02:56:09.060
little podoc convention to do coverage when a local newspaper does that they're going to

02:56:09.060 --> 02:56:14.740
write up a little page little story two pictures tops you got small press lights like myself that

02:56:14.740 --> 02:56:20.340
will go around and take hundreds of pictures interview all these people and put all this

02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:25.700
content up ab abc is going to come out there and get pictures of all the people in costume and be

02:56:26.340 --> 02:56:29.780
look what's going on at the hilton this week and then they'll show you know people dressed

02:56:29.780 --> 02:56:35.940
in costume behind the current temperatures that's what's gonna happen mm-hmm well anyway

02:56:36.580 --> 02:56:40.180
all right uh rama I'm gonna let you go to see if we get any more calls in but any other thoughts

02:56:40.180 --> 02:56:47.620
for our listeners tonight um I don't have any right now but it is what it is all right well

02:56:47.620 --> 02:56:52.980
take care of my friend youtube brother all right bye all right uh orange lounge radio all one word

02:56:53.060 --> 02:56:58.180
on skype bob bobbie's popping off in chat but he sees right on the money bobbie says my favorite

02:56:58.180 --> 02:57:02.820
pack story was that they invited rob and i to be on a panel about building a podcast community

02:57:02.820 --> 02:57:07.860
they removed the panel from the schedule and then denied us press passes i i forgot that that

02:57:07.860 --> 02:57:15.460
happened because that was so shitty i don't have i i honestly don't have another word for it sorry

02:57:15.460 --> 02:57:20.180
and maybe that explains where some of my bitterness from packs comes from but that was so shitty like

02:57:20.180 --> 02:57:26.260
or wasn't there like a year where they like denied a press passes or something even though

02:57:26.260 --> 02:57:32.500
like we were part of like the microsoft you know like we had our icon stuff the podcasting

02:57:32.500 --> 02:57:41.460
communities like we had our own you know i'm sure that was e3 or gamertag ridiculous uh but we you

02:57:41.460 --> 02:57:47.860
know we're we're recognized we see we have our own thing on xbox you get your own gamertag with our

02:57:48.180 --> 02:57:52.580
picture you know what and i remember that because bobbie says we we had a listener who bought extra

02:57:52.580 --> 02:57:56.100
passes sold us to face value because we had already booked the travel and hotel that's why

02:57:56.100 --> 02:57:59.540
it was so shitty because i'd already spent my money to go out there so i could be on this

02:57:59.540 --> 02:58:05.860
fucking panel and then they didn't even end up doing it so whatever you know what i'm doing

02:58:05.860 --> 02:58:11.620
great panels at other cons so that's that but that was i mean what else would you call it we

02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:16.420
booked travel and hotel and then we can't even get tickets because they pulled it at the last minute

02:58:16.420 --> 02:58:22.660
and then god yeah i don't even know if i ever really i i don't i don't know if i ever properly

02:58:22.660 --> 02:58:26.980
popped off on that on the show because i was still trying to maintain some sense of you know

02:58:26.980 --> 02:58:32.020
professionalism oh maybe we'll give you invited back next year but in my old age i give less and

02:58:32.020 --> 02:58:37.620
less of a fuck so there you go that's that's the real tea on what happened with uh packs but then

02:58:37.620 --> 02:58:43.060
i mean we were there and not only is that like in the back of my head but just the whole time

02:58:43.060 --> 02:58:50.180
i'm at this convention going this solo sucks anyway except packs that's what that's kind of

02:58:50.180 --> 02:58:54.340
just how that year was for me except the people the people are awesome and the people are wonderful

02:58:54.340 --> 02:58:59.540
and all that so all right uh let's see we'll give one more chance for any calls to come in at orange

02:58:59.540 --> 02:59:04.500
lounge radio all one word on uh skype uh meanwhile while we wait for that call to come in uh loki any

02:59:04.500 --> 02:59:09.460
other last minute stories to talk about no i didn't have anything but i did see like you know

02:59:09.460 --> 02:59:15.700
rumor thread or whatever talking about the whole sony not going to um you know e3 and stuff like

02:59:15.700 --> 02:59:19.940
that and the one the rumors was well you know those games they've been showing off at e3 last

02:59:19.940 --> 02:59:24.260
year well those are all going to be launch titles for the new system so they can't really show off

02:59:24.260 --> 02:59:30.340
those again because it's going to be i don't know that they might move those to launch titles but

02:59:30.340 --> 02:59:35.380
i would say then what the hell's going to come out in 2019 which no i don't i don't understand i

02:59:35.380 --> 02:59:41.060
mean you might have something that kind of does both like especially if playstation 5 is backwards

02:59:41.060 --> 02:59:48.020
compatible with playstation 4 titles then you which i like sony backwards compatible look i know

02:59:48.020 --> 02:59:53.380
bitch but i hope sony's fucking figure that out at this point right but it's kind of like when like

02:59:53.380 --> 02:59:57.540
when the weu came out i feel like there were still some last minute we games they were kind of like

02:59:57.540 --> 03:00:01.620

03:02:06.820 --> 03:02:11.620
want to go back to the call center and now i'm not in the call center so it sucks again i haven't

03:02:11.620 --> 03:02:17.780
been on jury duty so i was on a jury in 2006 right for like probably about two weeks and then i i got

03:02:17.780 --> 03:02:24.020
it again the next year and i haven't gotten it since knock on wood yeah because uh yeah i'm no

03:02:24.020 --> 03:02:27.860
there might have been one time since then i think when i was working in my current employer i got

03:02:27.860 --> 03:02:32.420
the notice but like it was one of those my group number never got called in well we'll see i don't

03:02:32.420 --> 03:02:36.900

03:02:36.900 --> 03:02:42.180
that friday or this friday so we'll see but it sucks it's just like it's an inconvenience because

03:02:42.180 --> 03:02:46.980
it's in the middle of sacramento if it was like you know elk placerville or something like that

03:02:46.980 --> 03:02:53.220
