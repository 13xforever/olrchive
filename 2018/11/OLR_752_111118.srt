00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, things go away such as upcoming DLC for one major game and a publisher of video game guides

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But there are new releases on the way too and we will talk about all that and more on this week on the show where every gamer has a voice

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight episode number 752 for this November the 11th of 2018

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you in studio with my co-host, Techmaster Loki

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How are you?

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm fine

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Good, good to have you back here

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's gonna be our last show for two weeks, well yeah cause we won't be here next week

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So this is the Thanksgiving special I suppose

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Although we will be here the Sunday after Thanksgiving which will pretty much be right after the Black Friday holiday

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Steam sale

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Supposedly

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
All sales

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
All the sales really

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well what's interesting is that usually that's the point in the year where like okay that's it

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
All the video games are out for the year, they're all out now

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Not this year

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Not this year, no you're right because especially Smash Ultimate is probably like the huge exception

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And the same day

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The same day as Smash Ultimate

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Is

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Earth Defense Wars 5

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh how could I forget, you're absolutely right, Earth Defense Wars 5 is also coming out that same day

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Not here tonight in studio, Dark Soccer or JB Summers, she is still on a work conflict for a little while

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
She will be joining us through Radio Magic later in the show

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Of course you guys are joining us in our chat room as you do every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
When we tape live at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We tape of course Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And if you are listening to us live, you can join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And as I mentioned there a little programming note, we will not be here next Sunday

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I will be in Las Vegas or actually on Sunday I will be coming back from Las Vegas

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Having just attended the Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest for the year 2018

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is, it's kinda like Blizzcon

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But for the other MMO that a lot of people play, Final Fantasy IV

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Actually I should, there's plenty of MMOs that lots of people play

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But Final Fantasy XIV is another big one and it's one that I've been playing pretty much

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I played the 1.0 version of the game ok, I suffered through the 1.0 version of the game

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But my love of the online Final Fantasies goes back to Final Fantasy XI

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Which Loki and I used to play as well

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Do you still get the emails begging you to come back to Final Fantasy XI?

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh they just, they're showing up on my Instagram

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Final Fantasy XI is like advertising on Instagram

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And they're doing some big campaign right now and I didn't even see all the details

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If I wanna know the details

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I would love to come back to Final Fantasy XI

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If they make it free

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Where is Final Fantasy XI that I can come back to? Isn't it not online anymore?

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No it is, it's been online for PC

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You cannot connect anymore on Playstation or Xbox 360

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
They took off that support, it's only PC

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I thought they shut the whole thing down

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No, it's only, no

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The PC version is still going, I have a friend that still plays it

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So it's still there

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And they still add to it

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
They're still doing little things here and there

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I mean, since they use basically a made up language

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They'll talk about all these new zones

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And I'm like, I have no idea what that word means

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But sounds cool, go off I guess

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So yeah, so

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But this Fan Fest I'm going to in Vegas has nothing to do with XI

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's all about XIV which, you know, I do enjoy

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I've been on a little bit of a hiatus from XIV

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Just because I kinda, I don't really do the raiding

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't do a lot of the endgame progression that other people do

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So I'm just kind of in a lull right now

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But that's why I'm excited to go to this event

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Because it will be inevitably announcing next year's expansion

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Because it's a very obvious pattern now

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And not only that, but they'll probably get to, you know, do some special fights on the computer

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Special stuff and there'll be some panels

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And most of all, most importantly, concerts

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So they're doing the two concerts again

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So they're going to have a piano concert one night

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And then they're going to have the Primals

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Which is the band fronted by Soken

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Who does the music of Final Fantasy XIV

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And even if you don't play Final Fantasy XIV

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Even if you have no interest in MMOs

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Seriously, go listen to some of the soundtrack songs of Final Fantasy XIV

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Because it's amazing

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And Soken has done a great job

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So his band will be there with that concert

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So I'm just excited to just take that all in

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And some other friends of mine are going to be there

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It'll be good

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Anyway, we're going to get into tonight's kickoff topic here in a moment

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Which is also about Final Fantasy

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
First I want to address a couple of things that don't have anything to do with video games

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But I think they're important to say

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
First of all, happy Veterans Day

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think that's very important

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Because I know we have plenty of veterans that listen to Orange on Triadio

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So I just want to say thank you for what you do

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And your service

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And defending our right to have this show

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
To have our lame ass opinions

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And the freedom of speech that everybody defends out there

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Working hard in our military

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So happy Veterans Day to all of you

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The other thing I want to address is that

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's really smoky here in Sacramento

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I went out last night and I had to wear a mask

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Because of all this smoke that's everywhere

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's awfully inconvenient

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But it's nothing compared to what's happening up the road a little bit

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
In the town of Paradise

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Or, I can't even believe I'm saying this

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What was the town of Paradise?

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't know if you all know this

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But if you've ever read my bio

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
On vogginetwork.com

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I actually went to Chico State for a few years

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And I was involved with radio up there

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So Chico is kind of like the larger town in California

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's be real, when you go north of Sacramento

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
In San Francisco, there isn't a lot

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
From here to the border

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's a very different California

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's the red woody part of California

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's very different from what you all might think of

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If you haven't been to California before

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So, Chico is one of the larger towns

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Because it has the school

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But I distinctly remember

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I had an old roommate who used to fix computers

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
In the town of Paradise

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And there was a road, you take the skyway

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You go up the skyway, Paradise is this lovely town

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That sits up on the hill

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's gorgeous views from up there

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's why they call it that

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I do remember visiting the town

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And having memories

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm shocked

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm in a state of OMG

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Just hearing that the town is gone

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And it's not just affecting Paradise

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm hearing now

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's moved into Magalia

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And some of the other cities up there

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That I bet a lot of you probably don't know

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Because they are smaller communities in California

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But it's very, very, very, very scary

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Obviously, this is not the only part of California

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's on fire right now

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's the one that is

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I feel like I have a little bit of connection to it

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because I know a lot of people from those days

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That are being affected by this

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But certainly the town of Thousand Oaks

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Experiencing multiple tragedies this week

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I mean, we had the unspeakable event

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That happened at the country western bar with a shooter

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And then, now they're on fire too

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And that's affecting Malibu

164
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And I'm sure some of you guys have been hearing about that one

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Because of the celebrities posting

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That their homes are gone

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's crazy

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's so, so crazy

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And I was really, really disappointed

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You know, I don't like to get political on the show

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And I like to keep it video games

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But I was really disappointed

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That our leader of this nation

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Could not write

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
A humane tweet

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
About the situation

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And instead felt the need to

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Use it as an opportunity to attack California

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
When I believe over 90%

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Of the forest land in California

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Is actually federally overseen

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So, congrats

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You played yourself, jerk

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But I was so mad about that

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But anyway, again, I'm not

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I promise I won't get political, so I'm just gonna swallow that thought

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But it was just very

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Very irritating to read about

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But if you want to try to make a positive

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
About it, no matter where you're at politically

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I would refer you to a page

192
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't often do this

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But it's just a great compilation

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That one of our local television stations

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Put together, because I don't want to tell you

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
To do one charity or the other charity

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Everybody might have different ways to look into it

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So, this is a shout out to one of our local

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
TV stations, but it's cbs13.com

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Slash help

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So, it's very easy to understand

202
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
URL as well, cbs13.com slash help

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And if you see a charity in there that looks like

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Something you could help out with

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And help these folks up in Paradise

206
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Megalia, the North State, and people that are facing

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This, I think that would be

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Really, really great

209
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So, I just wanted to give a shout out to that

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay, anyway, I had to get it off my chest

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I know it doesn't have to do with video games

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But, some things are a bigger deal

213
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I heard some video of it was making

214
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's way around video game blogs

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
One of my friends was like, did you see the video on Kotaku

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
With the fire, and I was like

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Why is it on Kotaku, but

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I mean, these are things that impact us

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
All, gamers and non-gamers alike

220
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, let's shift gears, Loki

221
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's talk about video games

222
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Because that is the podcast you all signed up to hear

223
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And when it is smoky outside

224
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
On a day like today, I know I

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Sat in the house and I played video games all day

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Which we'll talk about during my gaming week

227
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But, some people might be

228
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Playing games that are not going to have

229
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Much DLC in the future, right, Loki?

230
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, and this is one game that I've played

231
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Like, ten minutes of and really needed to go back

232
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
To its own point, but I'm not doing that yet

233
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So, Final Fantasy XV

234
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They have announced

235
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That three of the four upcoming pieces

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Of DLC have been cancelled

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And right now

238
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The one that is

239
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Remaining is going to be coming out

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Looks like next year

241
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And so, the one that's left

242
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Is going to be the Arden

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And that will be coming out March 2019

244
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So, the

245
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Ariane

246
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What is it?

247
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Arane, Luna and Noctis

248
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Ariane, I think is how you say it

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't remember, but yeah

250
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Those are cancelled

251
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And then along with that

252
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
They said

253
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They're going to be releasing a short form

254
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Anime called Final Fantasy XV

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Episode Arden Prologue

256
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And that's going to be coming out

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Looks like they have

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Teasers that are going to be coming out on December 15th

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And it's going to release on

260
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
January 10th

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And then

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
They've got a Final Fantasy

263
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
XV Multiplayer Comrades

264
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Which is going to be coming out on

265
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And that's on December 12th

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The multiplayer has been out

268
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This is some type of stand alone thing

269
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And it's going to be

270
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Some stand alone thing that will include new bosses

271
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Costumes, weapons and what not

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So, they have multiplayer in the game now?

273
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I know, they patched it in a long time ago and I never bothered to check it out

274
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Which might be part of the problem, but we'll get to that

275
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And then of course

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
They said that there is going to be a collaboration with Final Fantasy XIV

277
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Online

278
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Adventurer from Another World

279
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And that's going to be

280
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Playable in Final Fantasy XV

281
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't understand

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
How that's going to work, but that's on December 12th as well

283
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Interesting, well I know

284
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They did an event for Lightning Returns

285
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
In Final Fantasy XIV and Lightning shows up

286
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
In the world of XIV and you kind of work with her

287
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
In some fates and then

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If you get enough points from participating

289
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You can dress up exactly

290
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I think for female characters

291
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You get an outfit that looks just like Lightning

292
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
For male characters you get an outfit that looks like snow

293
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So, yeah

294
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's what you got for participating

295
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So imagine the XV crossover will be something similar in XIV

296
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And then I don't know

297
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If they'll put some of the bosses

298
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
In XV or what they're going to do

299
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't know how that's going to work

300
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But, I mean, still kind of a big deal

301
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That these big DLC pieces

302
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Are cancelled

303
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And the guy left

304
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He left Square Enix

305
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The guy who had been designing all this

306
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Has left

307
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Which is a pretty big deal as well

308
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, so

309
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Hajime

310
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Tabata

311
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He had left

312
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And he had taken over for Tetsuya

313
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And Nomura back in 2013

314
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He's gone though

315
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Because Tetsuya Nomura is probably over on Kingdom Hearts 3 now

316
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Cranking that out and then still has

317
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The Final Fantasy VII remake to do after that

318
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So I wonder if there was some sort of

319
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Disagreement or something that caused him to leave

320
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, the disagreement may be

321
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That they were talking

322
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What, like a $44 million loss

323
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Or something like that on all this

324
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I mean, it's pretty incredible

325
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The hit

326
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know if it's specifically this

327
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But Square Enix kind of took a hit

328
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It seems like they're trying to recreate VII

329
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Like the phenomenon that was VII

330
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
With all the spin-offs and everything

331
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And it's just not ever getting to that level

332
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Right

333
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I have mixed feelings about this

334
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Because I know XV has its fans

335
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And I wouldn't even say I don't dislike XV

336
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Honestly, in the

337
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
In the scope of all Final Fantasy

338
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Games ever, XV is probably somewhere

339
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
In the middle of the pack for me

340
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's higher than VIII

341
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's higher than the original

342
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
NES trilogy, which I think it just

343
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Those NES games were good

344
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And they were important, but they're outshone

345
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
By what the technology

346
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Of the later games can do

347
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So I think I would rank it above some of those

348
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But it's certainly not as good

349
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
As IV, VI, X

350
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
For me, I mean every

351
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Critic is going to have their own list

352
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Of how they rate the Final Fantasy games

353
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And certainly I know

354
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
How I feel about VIII is extremely

355
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Controversial, but

356
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, XV I would say

357
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Is somewhere in the middle of the pack, but

358
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think the thing that frustrates me

359
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And what frustrated me about XV to begin with

360
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Is that I bought the game

361
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I played this game start to finish

362
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
For what it was, and then it was like

363
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh hey, we're going to keep changing this game

364
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But Final Fantasy

365
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Was never this

366
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Online persistent experience to me

367
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Because it takes you

368
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
50 hours to beat this game

369
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't know, it depends how fast you all play

370
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But to hear them say, oh we're going to go back and change

371
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Chapter 13, or whatever

372
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah, Chapter 13 was kind of

373
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Busted and probably needed to be re-looked at

374
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But I don't want to go back and

375
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Just play that one chapter

376
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And XV doesn't do anything for me

377
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You know what I mean?

378
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm not the biggest fan of

379
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Editing these games massively

380
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
After they're released

381
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And then XV just kind of continued to do that

382
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
With this model

383
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I know some of the DLC was spin-off stuff

384
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And that was fine

385
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's a way to do it

386
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But I just felt like

387
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
In a way, and I think a lot of you kind of felt like this

388
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Is that with Final Fantasy XV it was like

389
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
They were consistently adding to this game

390
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
They wanted to be there

391
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
When it actually released

392
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But they weren't able to actually put in the game

393
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Because they were forced to put the game out by a certain time

394
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Because it had been in development for so long

395
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Although we all know

396
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That game's real development was only like

397
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The last two or three years of the cycle

398
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You know what I mean?

399
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Especially if you go back and look at the original Versus 13 trailer

400
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It is very clear

401
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Things were scrapped, things were changed

402
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And probably when this creative change happened

403
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The entire thing was scrapped and redone

404
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Which, you know

405
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Kind of goes back to

406
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Just sometimes how the big business

407
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
End of things can really screw things up

408
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And it's what really ticked me off about the Mass Effect franchise too

409
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Now what's weird

410
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Is that with the Mass Effect franchise

411
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I kind of wish they would have been able to do some DLC

412
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But the DLC in Mass Effect

413
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Would have been different

414
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Like it would have been after the game

415
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They wouldn't have been trying to go back and change the game in progress

416
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And when they started to do that

417
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Which, by the way, they started to do in Mass Effect Andromeda

418
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Was go back and change all this shit about the game in progress

419
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I lost interest completely

420
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I was like, here we go again

421
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The game I bought is not the game they wanted to put out

422
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
They're going back and changing everything in the middle

423
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You know what, I'll go back and play it in the year

424
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
When it's actually done

425
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And unfortunately that attitude

426
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Across the board with a lot of people

427
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Probably helped that game to flop

428
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And now they're not going to do the Corian DLC

429
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And you know that game is not remembered fondly

430
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But in my opinion

431
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
EA fucking hosed that game

432
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
By forcing them to release it when they did

433
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I know that game would have been in development for a long time

434
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But again, I think the real development cycle

435
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Was really towards the end of it

436
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And it needed six more months in the oven

437
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And we would have had a different story here

438
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I think

439
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah

440
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But um

441
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What else did I want to say about Final Fantasy XV?

442
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Then I'll look at our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com

443
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But with Final Fantasy XV

444
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's just like

445
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
In a way, I'm kind of

446
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I don't want to say I'm happy in this news

447
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
At all, because I don't want to take delight

448
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
In the loss or in the

449
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You know, the

450
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm not one of those people that wants to see game companies

451
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Suffer because I know that means the game makers

452
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Suffer and that's not

453
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't see how that's going to make games better

454
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Like sometimes I read Twitter and I'm like

455
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The fuck are you people thinking? Like these are people's

456
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Jobs and stuff

457
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But at a higher level

458
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I am kind of like, in a way

459
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Glad they're going to finally walk away

460
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
From Final Fantasy XV in a way

461
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Like I mean they have these other little things to cap it off

462
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm kind of glad they're going to walk away from Final Fantasy XV

463
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And they can focus on the next thing creatively

464
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Which I hope

465
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
There's a Final Fantasy XVI in the works somewhere

466
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That hopefully has been in the works

467
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
For a while and hopefully will be done

468
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
By the time they want to release it

469
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But I'm a little worried because

470
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Is it just me

471
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Or is Final Fantasy VII

472
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Final Fantasy XVI

473
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That's the impression I get

474
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Final Fantasy Remake is being treated like

475
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's a full Final Fantasy title

476
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So Final Fantasy VII

477
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Is Final Fantasy XVI if you get what I'm saying

478
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I kind of feel like that's where it's going

479
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But I just hope

480
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Again creatively

481
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I think Final Fantasy kind of just needs

482
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
A kick in the pants with a new single player story

483
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't know if this did it

484
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
For a lot of people

485
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You can go back to turn based combat

486
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Dungeon Buster

487
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Over in our chat

488
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
At live.vognetware.com giving me the numbers

489
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I was trying to reach for earlier

490
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
33 million from changes

491
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
To Luminous Studios

492
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Square Enix did not have a great quarter

493
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But Japanese physicals tend to be pretty dry

494
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Octopath and Shadow of the Tomb Raider

495
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Apparently did okay

496
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But we have no idea or numbers from Square Enix

497
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
On how well they actually did

498
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But we do know from NPD

499
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That Octopath anyway

500
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Was kind of a sleeper hit here

501
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It was the number one game of the month

502
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
For that to do

503
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So we do know some little things

504
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Here and there

505
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Let's see, Siya Tabiri in chat says

506
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Was it you guys who said that Final Fantasy VIII

507
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And The Spirits Within should have been swapped

508
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That Final Fantasy VIII was more cinematic

509
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And Final Fantasy The Spirits Within would have been better fodder

510
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
For an actual game

511
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes I have said that before

512
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Both of those things were in development around the same time

513
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And I think Final Fantasy VIII as a movie

514
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Would have been amazing

515
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And I think there's a lot of

516
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Ideas in The Spirits Within

517
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That could have been a great game

518
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And then it would have felt more like Final Fantasy

519
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I think maybe if it had been a game

520
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Perhaps others won't agree with me

521
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But that's my opinion

522
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Let's see

523
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Dungeon Buster continues with another thought here

524
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I wasn't a huge fan

525
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Of Final Fantasy XV's direction

526
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But it had enough to keep me on top of the hunts

527
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And grind through its dungeons

528
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's still really surprising how far Square Enix was cutting back

529
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
However with this news

530
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Tigercall on chat talking about the Mass Effect thing

531
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Is it a little too soon

532
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
To reboot Mass Effect?

533
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't know if

534
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Anybody wants to see them

535
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Reboot the Shepard story

536
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I think it's a good idea to do somebody else's

537
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Story in the same universe

538
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I think that's what they tried to do with

539
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Andromeda

540
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Andromeda was Ryder's story

541
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And by setting it in this whole other galaxy

542
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That was Square Enix's creative way

543
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Of having your choices

544
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
From the original Mass Effect trilogy

545
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Not have as great of an impact

546
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And not need to have as much

547
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
To account for

548
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
In Mass Effect Andromeda

549
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
As a Mass Effect fan I would be okay

550
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
If they wanted to do somebody else's

551
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Continuing story in the Mass Effect universe

552
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And do something like Dragon Age did

553
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
When they did Dragon Age Inquisition

554
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And do an online thing

555
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That lets you revisit

556
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Seven of the biggest decisions from the Mass Effect franchise

557
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And tailor how

558
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Your Mass Effect universe went

559
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
From there

560
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't think it has to import my Mass Effect 3 save

561
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And know every little nook and cranny

562
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Of what I did

563
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I would be okay if it was maybe

564
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
50 years later

565
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And some of the big decisions have an impact

566
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Certainly there's going to be some of the big questions

567
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Like, did you cure the genophage?

568
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's going to have a lasting effect

569
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Was there control

570
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Or synthesis

571
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And they may have to

572
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
For the sake of creative reasons

573
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The canon ending is the destroy ending

574
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
This game takes place

575
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
50 years after the destroy ending

576
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
In Mass Effect

577
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Although I know there will be fans out there that will be like

578
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But my ending

579
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I would be totally okay with that

580
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
If Bioware came out and said

581
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
This is a Mass Effect game that takes place

582
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
After the destroy ending

583
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And what happens here

584
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I would be totally fine with that

585
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Alright

586
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Looking in our chat with other comments over at

587
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Let's see

588
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And on that note, when was the last time we saw any new trailers

589
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Or anything for that, the Final Fantasy 7 thing

590
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
At E3, Final Fantasy 7 was nowhere to be found

591
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And they didn't do PlayStation Experience this year

592
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So

593
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
They could

594
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Do the game awards

595
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Or something like that

596
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Or they may just sit on it for a little longer

597
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Which makes us all wonder

598
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
If that game is facing some development struggles

599
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Who knows

600
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Dungeon Buster says

601
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But they can reboot the gameplay with new ideas

602
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And hopefully new stories

603
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And Bobby Blackwolf says

604
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Then they can make another game that takes place after the

605
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Non-destroy ending

606
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
They could

607
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But I bet they would be more interested in making a trilogy

608
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That takes place kind of in the same

609
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
General world, but we'll see

610
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Why don't we just do it like Pokemon

611
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Where they have, you know

612
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Red, green, and blue or whatever

613
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
This is the destroy ending one

614
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I think the reality is

615
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's different depending on your ending

616
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
That they would really be two separate games

617
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Developed concurrently and I just think

618
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Financially that's not the best idea

619
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
They really need to take the Fallout 4 approach

620
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Where it doesn't matter what you do, it all ends up being the same anyways

621
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Honestly

622
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
To get another Mass Effect game

623
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I would be completely okay if BioWare says

624
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
These are the canon changes

625
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That we're exploring

626
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And due to limitations we're just not going to be able to

627
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Allow you to import your own

628
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Shepard experience

629
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
If they're going to come out with another Mass Effect game

630
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It would be for like Playstation 5 at this point

631
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I wouldn't expect that you're going to be able to import

632
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
A Playstation 3 save file

633
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Onto your Playstation 5, it's fine

634
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I can let that go

635
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Just give me a good

636
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Freaking Mass Effect game

637
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Of course they can't even play Playstation 1 games

638
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
On the Playstation 4

639
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So what makes you think they're going to be able to import any

640
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Saves in the Playstation 5

641
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Mega Man X400 is in chat

642
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
They're saying calling it right now

643
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Final Fantasy 7 Remake will become Final Fantasy 16

644
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It will be different enough that Square

645
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Will say it's a new game

646
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That would be, that would be risky

647
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I could see them taking some changes

648
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And liberties with the story and maybe trying to do something like that

649
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But it would just, it would be weird

650
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't think they would ever do that

651
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't, I just see them releasing

652
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It as Final Fantasy 7

653
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And just dropping the word remake

654
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Why not just do that?

655
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I would think that is more plausible

656
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Than Final Fantasy 16

657
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I think they're developing something else

658
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
They've got to be

659
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We saw a Square Enix

660
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Crystal Tools trailer or something

661
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I remember seeing something for the Playstation 4

662
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That showed all this crazy stuff

663
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That Square Enix was working on

664
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I don't think it was intended to be

665
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
People thought, is there Final Fantasy 16 stuff in there?

666
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Eh, probably not

667
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
But there might be pieces in that

668
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
That maybe they're going to work with

669
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I would really like to see

670
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Square Enix, here's what they could do

671
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
In my opinion

672
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
They're probably using Final Fantasy 15's

673
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Engine for Final Fantasy 7

674
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You don't say based on the trailers

675
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah right, which is fine

676
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I would be completely fine if they

677
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Use Final Fantasy 15's remake

678
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Or Final Fantasy 15 remake

679
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Final Fantasy 15's engine

680
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
To make Final Fantasy 16

681
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But instead of it being like

682
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
The Broad Trip type of game

683
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Give me something that makes me think

684
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Final Fantasy 9

685
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm not saying literally those characters

686
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But you know how Final Fantasy 9

687
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Was a throwback to the classic Final Fantasy

688
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Like, Vivi looked like a Black Mage

689
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I'd rather it be Final Fantasy 6

690
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But I'm saying give me that

691
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Classic Final Fantasy taste

692
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
In that

693
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Final Fantasy 7 isn't even really that either

694
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Give me that

695
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Sure, Final Fantasy 6 inspired or whatever

696
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Give me that classic Final Fantasy taste

697
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
In Final Fantasy 15's engine

698
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I would be super into

699
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Characters just with the medieval look

700
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
As opposed to the cyberpunk look

701
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And I would be super into it

702
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I would love that

703
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So, we'll see

704
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Let's see, Dartitsia says

705
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Final Fantasy 15 remake

706
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Coming to the Playstation 9 in 2040

707
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And the Mega Man X400 follows up his comment

708
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And our reaction by saying

709
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Don't be mad when it happens

710
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I won't be mad

711
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But it would be weird

712
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Hey, we just finished Final Fantasy 15

713
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
We've tweaked all this up

714
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Let's make a Final Fantasy 15 remake

715
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
To be fair, to Delvin's credit

716
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You know what else was weird?

717
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Final Fantasy 11 being an MMO

718
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That you had to pay a monthly fee for

719
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So, you know what?

720
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Weird or cool?

721
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Well, the game turned out great, but I never understood

722
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Why they just didn't call it

723
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Final Fantasy Online

724
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Like, would that have been a terrible thing to call the game?

725
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Like, would less people have played it

726
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I don't think that would

727
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But then, what would Final Fantasy 14 be?

728
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I guess it would be Final Fantasy Online

729
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Well, 14 was weird too, because it's like

730
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah, we have all the same races

731
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
We're just gonna call them something different

732
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Well, that's because 1.0 is garbage

733
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And then, the realm we're born is fantastic

734
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But they were pigeonholed in all the garbage decisions 1.0 made

735
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So, they did the best they could, dammit

736
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Dartitsia says

737
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Like how Phantasy Star Online did it

738
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Then Final Fantasy 14 could have been Final Fantasy Universe

739
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Even if not as many people enjoyed Final Fantasy

740
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Not as many people enjoyed Final Fantasy Star Universe

741
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
We're gonna get a goddamn Final Fantasy game that's gonna have

742
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The Destiny model, where it's like this single multiplayer garbage

743
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's called Final Fantasy 15

744
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Oh, is this what I've missed?

745
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Not playing the game?

746
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
No, I'm not being fair

747
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
But, think about it

748
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
All of a sudden, now there's an online mode

749
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I want you to keep grinding

750
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It's just weird

751
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I don't think I always understood all the approaches

752
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Maybe you disagree with me

753
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And you can send an email

754
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That's fine, participate at orangeloungeradio.com

755
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
If you want to send us an email with your thoughts

756
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Bobby Black Wolf says

757
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yes, but then Final Fantasy Universe would have been released in the US

758
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Frowny face

759
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
That's Final Fantasy Online 2

760
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
By that thinking

761
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Because we did get Phantasy Star Universe on Xbox 360

762
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I loved it!

763
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I was like, I don't understand

764
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Debate for another show

765
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Everybody hated that game

766
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You know what game I really loved?

767
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
The single player

768
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
PSP game

769
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
That was Universe's engine

770
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But they made a single player PSP game

771
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It was Phantasy Star

772
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I don't remember what they called it, but it was great

773
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Because it was a completely different game than Universe

774
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But it was just like that exact same engine

775
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But single player, and it was great

776
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Anyway

777
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Well let's take a trip down memory lane

778
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Of our gaming weeks and talk about the types of

779
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Video games that we have been playing this week

780
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

781
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It was okay

782
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I played a little bit of

783
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
PlayStation VR

784
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Like on Friday I finally remembered

785
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh yeah, that's right

786
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Tetris Effect came out this week

787
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So then I decided to sit down and play it

788
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
For a little bit, so I did

789
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And I liked the new tracks that were in there

790
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But yeah

791
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I ran into the problem with it drifting to the left

792
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Unfortunately because I was playing in PlayStation VR

793
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So that was a little bit irritating

794
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And then I decided to

795
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Try some of the other games, because I've had a bunch of

796
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
VR games sitting on my hard drive

797
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I just haven't bothered to actually

798
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Play them yet, so one of the ones

799
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I was actually looking forward to was

800
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Just In Time Incorporated

801
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Which is a VR game

802
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's a silly

803
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Premise where you're

804
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
This government agency, or some sort of

805
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Agency that

806
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Gets to a location

807
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Right before people are about to die

808
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And you have to prevent them from dying

809
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Usually by killing somebody

810
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Else, and it's pretty funny

811
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So the very first tutorial

812
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Mission that they put you in

813
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
There's this person in an alley

814
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
A seedy alley next to a strip club

815
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And there's this guy charging at

816
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Him with a knife

817
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And because you're wearing these special gloves

818
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Everything moves ten times

819
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Slower than it would in real life

820
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So what you do, you grab the knife out of the

821
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Hand of the guy that's about to stab him

822
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And you stab the guy in the face

823
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And that's the end of the mission

824
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Okay, and it's awesome

825
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It's hyper-violent, and it's

826
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's a silly

827
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Fun game, so it's like if you

828
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I don't know, crossing

829
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Job simulator with

830
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
A hyper-violent game

831
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Hyper-violent job simulator

832
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Okay, I can dig it

833
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I play a little bit of

834
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I stream more DDR

835
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And

836
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I had a heart rate monitor

837
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Working, but unfortunately

838
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Fitbit decided to

839
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Just MVP their whole

840
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Windows 10 app

841
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And so the Windows 10

842
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
App sucks ass

843
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And doesn't work all the time

844
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
In fact, I only got to

845
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Work once with the actual

846
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
With it being able to detect my Fitbit

847
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So now, it won't detect it anymore

848
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Like, I got it to sync just fine

849
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
With my computer, I got the heart rate monitor

850
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
To display, because we have recorded footage

851
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Of that, and everything was perfectly fine

852
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And sure enough, to turn on the next day

853
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
None of it wants to work again

854
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And I blame the app

855
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And Windows 10, because Windows 10 is buggy

856
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
As fuck, so you know

857
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What are you gonna do?

858
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So I guess I have to buy this

859
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Unnecessary dongle that's

860
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Got a plug in there to sync a Bluetooth

861
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Thing to my computer, despite the fact that

862
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I have Bluetooth built in

863
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And it was synced to it at one point

864
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I don't know, it's stupid

865
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But that may be what I

866
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Have to do to get it to work

867
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Or just not put it in there

868
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Because that may be the other option

869
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Since it's just being difficult

870
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
We'll see

871
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So there's that, and then

872
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Of course I was working a little bit more

873
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
On my StepMania theme that I was gonna

874
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Put on the cabinet

875
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Once I load StepMania on there

876
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So I was doing a little bit of that

877
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And picking out songs I want to put on there

878
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
As well

879
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Then, oh yeah

880
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
My new DVD drive

881
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
That's gonna be able to put that super disk

882
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
On there, that is coming

883
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Very soon, hopefully

884
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Actually, it last scanned in Washington

885
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So it's just a few states away

886
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Hopefully gonna get it next week

887
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So we'll be able to do that

888
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Preferably before

889
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
20th of November

890
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It's the big day you're shooting for

891
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Exactly

892
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Are you gonna do an epic DDR stream on 20th of November?

893
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Probably not, because it'll just be

894
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
After work, but we'll see what we can do

895
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Alright, my gaming week

896
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So I finally

897
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Set up the PlayStation VR

898
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Because I needed to play me

899
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Some Tetris Effect, which just came out

900
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Of course on PlayStation 4

901
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I talked about the demo a little bit

902
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Last week and how much I enjoyed that

903
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So obviously I was gonna get the retail version of the game

904
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
We all knew that

905
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I have said it on the show before

906
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'm a huge fan of Tetsuya Mizuguchi

907
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I don't know if there's a game he's done that I didn't like

908
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I even kind of thought

909
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
99 Nights was alright

910
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But as far as things like Every Extend Extreme

911
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Luminous

912
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Meteos, Space Channel 5

913
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I've always really loved

914
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
These games

915
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So when I heard that he got the Tetris license

916
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And that E3 trailer

917
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Already sold, like I didn't even need a demo

918
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I didn't need anything else, all I needed was that

919
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Hey, Mizuguchi's doing a Tetris game

920
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Sold, done, right?

921
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It's basically Mizuguchi's doing a bullet

922
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It doesn't matter, it's like okay, I'll buy it

923
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
He can do a bullet hell game and I'd buy it

924
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I don't give a shit

925
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
He's great, I'm such a fan

926
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So I'm saying that

927
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Kind of as a disclaimer

928
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Because maybe my opinion is a little biased

929
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Because I've always been a fan of his

930
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But I fucking love Tetris Effect

931
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Outstanding

932
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It's one of my favorite gaming experiences

933
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
In the last several years, honestly

934
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's

935
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And I know there's people that are probably just going

936
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's just Tetris though

937
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Alright, but this is like

938
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Honestly the best version of Tetris they've done

939
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And yes, I'm including the original NES

940
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yes, I'm including the Game Boy version

941
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes, I'm including the DS version

942
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
That was pretty good too

943
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
That's not to say any of those versions were bad

944
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Or more importantly, important

945
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
The original NES version

946
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Of course, I mean Nintendo's version

947
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Not the Atari version

948
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Although it was important for its own reasons too

949
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
The Game Boy version was massively important

950
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
But Tetris Effect is like

951
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The best one

952
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And using the technology that's available today

953
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And they have an homage to the

954
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Game Boy Tetris song

955
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
In Tetris Effect

956
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Oh, I haven't discovered that yet

957
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That's pretty cool

958
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I've discovered in some of the

959
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Marathon modes

960
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Or what are those

961
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Not the Journey, Effect

962
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's in one of the Effect ones

963
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
The Effect stuff, some of it has the classic Tetris

964
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Brick styles and stuff

965
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Which is cool

966
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So here's the thing, some of you are probably going to be skeptical

967
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And you're like, Rob, it's $40 for Tetris

968
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
But here's the thing

969
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Especially in VR

970
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's an experience

971
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It's a trip

972
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It is relaxing

973
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It is engrossing

974
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It is beautiful

975
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I don't know how else to describe it

976
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
This is a great

977
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Application to sell PlayStation VR with

978
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Because you know what makes this great

979
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You know what makes this great for PlayStation VR

980
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Is that it's not

981
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Like a jump around and flail

982
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
With the PlayStation Move game

983
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Not that there's anything wrong with those types of games

984
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But I think it says a lot

985
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That the experience of playing on PlayStation VR

986
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Where you're just simply sitting on the couch

987
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
With your headset on

988
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And the controller

989
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
That playing this in PlayStation VR

990
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Allows the world around you

991
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
To literally disappear

992
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Especially if you're playing with headphones on

993
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And really immersing the sound

994
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
As well as the visuals

995
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It allows you to really just focus on

996
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The game

997
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And the experience of

998
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The music and the art

999
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That is being created as you're playing this game

1000
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Because even though

1001
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yes you're removing distractions in the real world

1002
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You know there are

1003
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm using my quoting fingers

1004
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Distractions that the game provides

1005
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But it really feels like a journey

1006
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
That you go on

1007
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
When you complete lines

1008
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Like let's say you're playing a stage

1009
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Where the background is an ocean that you're flying across

1010
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And when you complete lines

1011
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Dolphins will come out of the ocean

1012
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Like in the rhythm to the music and do things

1013
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But then like maybe after you've cleared so many lines

1014
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Things kind of like go underwater

1015
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It's like you're just doing this trip

1016
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
But Tetris is just that central theme

1017
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But like

1018
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The nice thing is everybody knows

1019
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
How to play Tetris

1020
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm not saying everybody knows how to play Tetris well

1021
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
But everybody understands I think

1022
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
The basic concept of Tetris is not an incredibly

1023
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Difficult one to explain

1024
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So this is just a really

1025
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Easy game to get into

1026
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And even if you don't have PlayStation

1027
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
VR I still think there's a lot

1028
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Here worth seeing especially if you like

1029
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Puzzlers I mean this is

1030
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Tetris

1031
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
If it was done like Luminous

1032
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That is exactly what it is

1033
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
There's really nothing else for me to explain about this game

1034
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Either you're gonna understand that

1035
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Description or you're not because you've played Luminous

1036
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You're either gonna understand it or you're not

1037
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But even if you don't understand it

1038
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I really like check out some YouTubes

1039
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Check out some people playing

1040
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It check out what it looks like and

1041
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Just see for yourself like what a

1042
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Trip it is but if you can if you have a friend

1043
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
That has PlayStation VR or something

1044
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Really you owe it to yourself

1045
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
To check this out in VR and really

1046
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Experience how the

1047
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Total immersion in a game

1048
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Like this can really change

1049
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The game playing experience

1050
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's really something to behold

1051
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And then I guess one other thing

1052
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I'll say about it again the whole like it was

1053
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
$40 for Tetris

1054
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You got like the main journey

1055
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Or story mode that has lots and lots of skins

1056
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
That you unlock as you're playing the game

1057
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But then there's also like this side mode

1058
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
This effect mode where you have

1059
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Sometimes weekend competitions

1060
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And you do this

1061
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
You can do like mystery blocks

1062
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Or you gotta clear 40 lines

1063
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
As fast as possible or you have

1064
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
To clear particular poison blocks

1065
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
On the field in a certain amount of time

1066
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Or you have to clear one

1067
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Line over and over like there's all these different types

1068
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Of like edit modes so it doesn't

1069
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Really feel stale and you know

1070
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
All these different type of edit modes have their own skins

1071
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And you're trying to play to unlock them

1072
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So that you can just do your own mode with the skins

1073
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
That you like if that's what you want to do

1074
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And you know that's another thing that's available to you

1075
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But I know the game

1076
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Is getting hazed a little bit because many people

1077
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Remember Tetris for multiplayer

1078
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Which is what the NES version

1079
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
The DS version and the Game Boy

1080
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Version really all brought to the table right

1081
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Was the multiplayer actually did the NES version

1082
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Have that maybe not

1083
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Did the NES version no it did you can do side by side

1084
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It's been so long Loki

1085
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I knew the Game Boy one was infamous

1086
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
For that with link cable and everything ok yeah

1087
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
The original NES did no I don't think

1088
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I think Tengen Tetris had it

1089
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I don't think NES Tetris had it

1090
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Somebody in chat let me know about that

1091
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Did Tetris NES have multiplayer

1092
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I don't think it did

1093
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But anyway

1094
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I know the Game Boy did

1095
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But anyway

1096
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I don't think the game

1097
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Totally needs

1098
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Multiplayer I kind of feel

1099
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Like that's a door they left shut

1100
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Because if there is a Tetris

1101
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Effect 2 and I really hope there

1102
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Is a Tetris Effect 2 and this game

1103
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Deserves a Tetris Effect 2 I have a

1104
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Feeling that's a door they'll open and explore

1105
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
But for this they wanted it to really be about the

1106
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Immersion the experience

1107
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And when you are sitting there with a VR

1108
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Headset on maybe looking at

1109
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Another player to yell at them about how they're stacking

1110
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Up lines on you is not something that really

1111
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Fits in with that picture you know you can't really

1112
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Immerse and do multiplayer

1113
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I think so

1114
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Maybe that's why they made the artistic

1115
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Decision they did

1116
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Dark Tetsuya said Tengen Tetris did

1117
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Two modes in fact

1118
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And Mega Man X400 says

1119
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
NES Tetris had multi I thought it didn't

1120
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I thought the Tengen one did

1121
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And that's why people crave

1122
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That cart more but I didn't think

1123
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Oh well it doesn't

1124
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Ultimately at this point that game is how old

1125
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
This is the new shit get on Tetris Effect

1126
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Leave the multiplayer

1127
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Behind for a little bit if you must play

1128
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Multiplayer Tetris get

1129
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The Tetris DS because it's

1130
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's a great version of that

1131
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And has many other great stuff too but this is

1132
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Worth it on its own merits

1133
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
As far as other games I've been

1134
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Playing this week I have been continuing Diablo 3

1135
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
On the Switch I was streaming a little bit

1136
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Of that actually and I'm just about

1137
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
To hit level 70 on my seasonal character

1138
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So I've been making away

1139
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
On that otherwise

1140
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I've been still playing a little bit of

1141
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
World of Warcraft I think my

1142
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Little warlock there is level

1143
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
118 so I'm almost to level

1144
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
120 where I can do the cool kid end game stuff

1145
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But for right now just still stuck on

1146
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Level 118 and trying to work on that

1147
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So that is about it for my gaming

1148
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Week so we'll get on into

1149
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The rest of the news for this week usually

1150
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I would do housekeeping but I've already told you

1151
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
We're not going to be here next week so

1152
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But I look forward to

1153
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Talking to you guys all about Final Fantasy

1154
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Fan Fest you can always follow me on Twitter

1155
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Of course if you want some tweets because I'm sure

1156
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'll be tweeting up a storm while I'm there

1157
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Maybe if the cell signal

1158
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Is decent maybe I'll do a twitch stream

1159
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
From the convention floor because that's something people

1160
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Do now right so

1161
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yeah maybe I'll try doing that if

1162
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Big if my cell phone signal

1163
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Cooperates I don't remember how good

1164
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It was or wasn't

1165
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
At the Rio because they had it

1166
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
At the Rio in 2014 but they did it at a

1167
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Different hotel in 2016 so I don't remember

1168
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
What the cell signal was like there but I do

1169
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Remember in 2014 one of the gifts

1170
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
They gave you in the goodie bag which I thought

1171
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Was brilliant a little cell phone charger

1172
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And it was already like full

1173
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And ready to go and I was like this is

1174
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
This is brilliant sadly I don't think they've already

1175
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Released the contents of this year's goodie bag

1176
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I don't think they have that you get like a full

1177
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Like actual backpack this year which is kind of cool

1178
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Cool yeah but they also

1179
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Released an update about how we're all gonna

1180
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Have to go through metal detectors to get into the convention

1181
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Just because of the way the

1182
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
World is in 2018 just compared to even

1183
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
2016 yeah when that wasn't a factor

1184
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But

1185
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
That is what it is alright anyhow

1186
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Let's get into some other gaming news Loki

1187
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Alright so this is

1188
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Sad but Prima Games is shutting

1189
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Down after 28 years

1190
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Prima of course you may remember

1191
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Does strategy guides for

1192
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Such games

1193
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Like we were talking about earlier Final

1194
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Fantasy 15 for example or

1195
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You know I think even Grand Theft Auto and that

1196
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Type of stuff so they're gonna be

1197
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Closing their doors

1198
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I wonder why

1199
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Now they're not closing

1200
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Until next spring but they're not

1201
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Gonna be publishing any new strategy guides for

1202
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The remainder of this year

1203
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Aren't they

1204
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The ones that are here locally I think they are local

1205
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
They're the ones that are out in Roseville right

1206
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Because I know there's two big strategy guide

1207
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Companies and I think Prima is the one that's out in Roseville

1208
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Which is not far from here

1209
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah I think so

1210
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I don't know

1211
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I don't remember if

1212
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
That is them

1213
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I think it could be though

1214
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I think it is but I mean

1215
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Regardless it is still

1216
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Still a little I mean I would say it's surprising

1217
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And at the same time I hate to say it like with the internet

1218
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Having

1219
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Dismantled regular instruction manuals

1220
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
But I mean strategy guides

1221
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Were always a heck of a collectible

1222
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
They were and also

1223
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Like sometimes

1224
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I know I can use the internet for like certain things

1225
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Like I know with Grand Theft Auto 5

1226
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I bought the strategy guide twice

1227
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I bought it when they had

1228
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
You know the Xbox 360

1229
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
PlayStation 3 version and then I bought it again

1230
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
When it came out for

1231
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Or was it 4 I'm thinking of

1232
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I must be thinking of 4

1233
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I don't know one of them I probably bought it for 5 as well

1234
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
No I did definitely buy it for 5

1235
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So I bought it again when the

1236
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC versions

1237
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Came out too because they had a whole new

1238
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Strategy guide and it was you know

1239
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I bought it to

1240
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
100% everything

1241
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Which I still haven't done

1242
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Prima is located in Roseville

1243
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And I'm going to get very local for a minute

1244
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
But it's for Loki's understanding

1245
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
You know how there's Kaiser out in Roseville? Yeah I know where it is

1246
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Target's on one side, Prima's on the other

1247
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Well myself and Jamie we got invited to go there one time

1248
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
That's right you guys went there once

1249
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And I didn't go

1250
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But we ended up not being able to meet with them

1251
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Like something our cancel lesson

1252
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I think Jamie did

1253
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I know she did but anyway that was a long time ago

1254
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I don't remember if that was

1255
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Like a secret meeting or what that was all about

1256
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Doesn't matter now

1257
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
But it's still unfortunate

1258
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
To hear what that's all going through over there

1259
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
But I think again

1260
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It's just the whole internet industry

1261
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Just really

1262
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Kind of people go to Game Facts

1263
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
YouTube

1264
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
YouTube is a huge thing too

1265
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Absolutely now go into our chat over at

1266
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Live.vognetwork.com

1267
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It says nobody reads game guides anymore

1268
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It's all about the YouTube walkthroughs

1269
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Even Game Facts gets less used these days

1270
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Cuddlebucket in chat

1271
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I like that name

1272
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Says their money probably came from licensing I think

1273
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Can't imagine sales for physical guides have been great

1274
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Since the internet age

1275
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I always kind of saw

1276
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Again I saw it more as like collectibles

1277
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
People just like to have that coffee table book

1278
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
You know

1279
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I mean I use the hell out of

1280
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
The Grand Theft Auto 5 one

1281
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Because it was

1282
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
You have to make sure that you didn't miss anything

1283
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So that you can get 100%

1284
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And I know with games like Red Dead Redemption 2

1285
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
There's ways you can miss missions

1286
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And stuff in the game

1287
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
If you don't do everything

1288
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And Grand Theft Auto 5 was kind of like that too

1289
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
With some of the characters you can pick up for the heist missions

1290
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
If you didn't do the one thing at a certain time

1291
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You'll miss it

1292
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And that's where the guide comes in

1293
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And also finding collectibles

1294
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Because fuck that shit

1295
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Tell me where they are and I'll just go pick them up

1296
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Kaijuto in chat says

1297
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Oh strategy guide I thought it was the game mag

1298
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The game mags suck

1299
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I don't think Prima had a game magazine

1300
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Maybe they did at one point

1301
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
But they were definitely more known for the guides

1302
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And that was

1303
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I remember when you'd go into Game Flop

1304
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And it would be like oh I'm going to pre-order this game

1305
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
They do that now

1306
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Oh you want to get the strategy guide with it?

1307
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Yeah you get 20% off the strategy guide

1308
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Doesn't Game Flop use their own

1309
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
In-house guide creator at this point?

1310
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
No I don't think so

1311
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Because Red Dead you can buy it

1312
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Or they even have one for Super Mario Odyssey

1313
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And they're starting to get phone book thick

1314
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
With a game like Red Dead I'm sure

1315
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Yeah

1316
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Alright

1317
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Cia Tabiri in chat says

1318
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
The strategy guides almost felt like enhanced art books sometimes

1319
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And that's not a bad thing though

1320
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Right?

1321
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Some of them were

1322
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Final Fantasy VII strategy guide

1323
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And it was like its own unique art and stuff

1324
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I think Allen used to love to buy those guides

1325
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Like back in the day

1326
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Because we have a bunch of them on the bookshelf

1327
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
They're for old ass players

1328
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
They're more collectible items

1329
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
They are

1330
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Moving on

1331
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Let's talk a little bit about some news out of Microsoft

1332
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Because Microsoft had their

1333
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
X018 event this weekend

1334
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
In Mexico City which was pretty cool

1335
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Because you know usually it's like

1336
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
They do something in New York, Vegas

1337
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Los Angeles, maybe Europe

1338
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Maybe Japan

1339
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
But you don't often hear of like a big game event in Mexico

1340
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So that was pretty cool that you know they got something there

1341
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
So for the

1342
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
X018 event we did get a little bit of news

1343
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I would say probably like not

1344
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Major major stuff on

1345
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
The par of what you

1346
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Get out of a

1347
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Playstation experience event

1348
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Which reminder they're not doing one this year

1349
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Which is interesting

1350
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But we did get some minor updates

1351
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Including the fact that PUBG is going to be added to Game Pass

1352
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Microsoft continues to really try to push

1353
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The Game Pass which is

1354
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
It's hard to argue with that

1355
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
They're really trying to up the value of that

1356
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Another game that they're going to be putting on Game Pass

1357
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Crackdown 3

1358
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Which has it's official launch game

1359
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
February 19th, 2019

1360
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I thought it was 15th

1361
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Might depend on the part of the world

1362
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
The article I'm looking at says February 9th

1363
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That could be Europe

1364
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
No it is 15th, I think there's a typo

1365
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
In the show world thread, that's fine

1366
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So it's February 15th, my bad

1367
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Heaven forbid they make you wait

1368
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
4 more days Loki, you've been waiting how long

1369
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
No

1370
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
No more waiting

1371
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Done, I'm done waiting

1372
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I gotta say though, I did watch the trailer for it

1373
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And Terry Crews is awesome

1374
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Of course, we knew that

1375
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Terry Crews

1376
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It's totally just like

1377
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
An Old Spice commercial right there

1378
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
He had one where it was him

1379
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Yelling at himself

1380
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Because it was his character and then him playing himself

1381
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Telling each other to be

1382
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Prepared for anything or something like that

1383
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
It was ridiculous

1384
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And I loved every second of it

1385
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I saw the gameplay

1386
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Oh man

1387
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
They have really

1388
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Toned down the visuals on that

1389
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
It's not like

1390
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Remember, we need the cloud

1391
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
The cloud's gotta process all this destruction

1392
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Because it's so crazy

1393
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
This multiplayer mode has an arena

1394
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
That you can destroy

1395
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
It's not the city, it's an arena

1396
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It's not as

1397
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
As a spectacle

1398
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
As it was before

1399
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I'm still gonna buy it

1400
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I don't fucking care

1401
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
It's disappointing

1402
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Let's see, also this is a pretty big deal

1403
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I think for some people

1404
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
The Final Fantasy 13 trilogy

1405
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Is being added to

1406
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Backwards compatibility on Xbox One

1407
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
That's pretty cool

1408
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Except for the fact that

1409
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
The games I own are all on PlayStation

1410
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But that's fine, whatever, congrats

1411
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Well, you just have to wait for that PlayStation

1412
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Backwards compatibility

1413
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
But that's really cool

1414
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
For the Xbox folks

1415
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And I think they said something about

1416
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Civilization Revolutions

1417
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Getting like a 4K

1418
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
That's pretty rad

1419
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
If I had an Xbox One X, I'd be really excited

1420
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But I don't, but I still think that's really cool

1421
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
They're supporting that

1422
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
They did show another Kingdom Hearts 3 trailer

1423
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
With the 100 Acre Wood

1424
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
They talked about mouse and keyboard support

1425
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
On Xbox One coming very soon

1426
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And they did confirm Fortnite will be a mouse and keyboard game

1427
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
On Xbox One

1428
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So, cool

1429
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Even though I would kinda wonder

1430
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Why you're not using a PC

1431
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
But I suppose not everybody has a PC

1432
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
As beefy as perhaps an Xbox One X

1433
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Is capable of processing

1434
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So, still pretty neat I guess

1435
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And then they did detail some of the expansion

1436
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
For Forza Horizon 4

1437
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Where you're gonna be looking for treasure

1438
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
In lightning storms

1439
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So it looks like you'll be kinda using that weather stuff again

1440
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
But this time it's gonna be lightning

1441
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But you can't take any damage from the lightning

1442
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
So what does it matter?

1443
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Yeah, exactly, who cares

1444
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I mean, with all these stuff I've crashed into

1445
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
If lightning hits the car, that's actually safe

1446
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
They say you can be in a car

1447
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And if lightning hits the car, you'll be fine

1448
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
It's like a big conductor, I guess

1449
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
It's not gonna be very effective in all those backwards compatibility games

1450
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Stop it, stop it

1451
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
So here's the thing

1452
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Then the biggest news

1453
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
By far the biggest news

1454
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Out of X018

1455
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
In my opinion

1456
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Two more studio acquisitions

1457
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So do you remember how the big news coming out of E3

1458
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Was that Microsoft acquired like what

1459
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Like five or six at E3

1460
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Guess what, now they've got two more

1461
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So they have acquired

1462
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Nxile Entertainment

1463
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And Obsidian

1464
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
That's a pretty big deal, especially when it comes to RPGs

1465
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So they are definitely

1466
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Getting their chess pieces in a row

1467
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
For whatever Xbox One

1468
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Successor is, Nxbox if you will

1469
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I don't think you're gonna see

1470
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Any huge announcements from these companies

1471
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Right away, but I definitely

1472
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Think Microsoft is positioning the chess pieces

1473
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So that when they announce Nxbox

1474
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I really think they're just gonna be like

1475
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And we're gonna have

1476
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
This game, and this game

1477
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And this game, and this game

1478
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And this game, and they're gonna go

1479
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Like all through their studios

1480
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And I really think that's an E3 that's coming

1481
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Is when Microsoft is gonna be like

1482
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Not only are we putting out this system

1483
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
But game from this in-house

1484
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Game from this in-house, game, game

1485
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Game, game, and they're gonna

1486
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Really try to

1487
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
One up the hell out of Sony

1488
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And whatever they've got in store for Playstation 5

1489
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Hoping and praying that Sony

1490
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Isn't cooking up as many

1491
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Exclusives of their own

1492
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Because I mean track record though

1493
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Sony does release some big exclusives

1494
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I mean

1495
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
If Microsoft can time it to get like

1496
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
All six or seven of their studios

1497
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
To like put out

1498
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
One game every other month for an entire

1499
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Year, that's gonna be really fucking

1500
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Impressive

1501
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Do you think that's the direction Microsoft's headed in?

1502
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Cause I sure do

1503
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I think the system's lacking

1504
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Exclusives

1505
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And so that's gonna help

1506
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I mean that's really

1507
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
The only piece of the puzzle I think

1508
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
That they're missing, that and

1509
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Japan but you know

1510
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Akuma JP in chat says and again

1511
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Microsoft is buying their way out

1512
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Well, money talks

1513
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
That's what companies do though

1514
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
That's what they do, how else are they gonna get exclusives

1515
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
If they really

1516
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Cause there's a part of me as well that still goes

1517
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Microsoft still feels like they're writing off Japan

1518
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
If Microsoft really

1519
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Wanted to turn some heads

1520
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
They'd fucking buy Capcom, Konami

1521
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Namco Bandai

1522
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Like one of the big

1523
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Well actually I would be totally okay with Microsoft

1524
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Like honestly, I'm gonna make the case right here

1525
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And y'all are gonna disagree, I don't give a fuck

1526
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I think the way to save Konami

1527
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
At this point is for Microsoft to buy it

1528
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And I think that would be a wonderful thing

1529
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I would love to see Microsoft buy Konami

1530
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
You can send those hate mail

1531
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
To Rob Roberts, care of Orange Launch Radio

1532
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com

1533
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
But let's be real, y'all hate Konami's management

1534
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You all hate Konami's management

1535
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So why not

1536
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Get rid of them and replace them

1537
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
With Microsoft's management

1538
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Which some of you are probably thinking

1539
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
God, that would be even worse

1540
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Is it right now?

1541
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I don't know, Microsoft's management is in a much better place

1542
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Much, much better place

1543
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
With the Xbox One than it was

1544
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
When good old Don Mattrick was unveiling it

1545
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Sports, sports, sports, TV, TV, TV

1546
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
So

1547
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I would kind of love

1548
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Now, I'm sure

1549
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It's a little more complicated

1550
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Because Konami has their arcade

1551
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Division, Konami has the

1552
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Casino stuff, which is all really big too

1553
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Speaking of which

1554
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Maybe there's a way that they only buy a case set

1555
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Speaking of which, was it

1556
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
According to the 20th anniversary

1557
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
DDR thing, supposed to be announcing

1558
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
New game next week

1559
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Or in a couple weeks

1560
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
In time to 20 November, probably

1561
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Yeah, probably time to 20 November

1562
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
If Microsoft really wanted to do something big

1563
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
They'd buy Nintendo

1564
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
You can't buy Nintendo

1565
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
No, you can't buy Nintendo

1566
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Nintendo has way too much cash on hand

1567
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Even after the Wii U

1568
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Kind of did not live up to expectations

1569
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It doesn't matter, Nintendo is swimming in money

1570
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
After the Wii

1571
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I'm just

1572
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Like, yeah, I'm just

1573
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Being fan wank completely

1574
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
It's not as easy as Microsoft

1575
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
There's a strategic partnership with Nintendo

1576
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Where they take care of their online

1577
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And then Nintendo can make some games for them

1578
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
She Hulk in chat

1579
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Says Microsoft should buy Nintendo

1580
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
There it is, or Bill Gates should

1581
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
And then we can play Gears of War on the Switch

1582
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I just, again

1583
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Although, in theory, you would think

1584
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Microsoft has endless, endless amounts of cash

1585
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
So does Nintendo

1586
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So it makes them very difficult to buy

1587
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
In that regard

1588
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
But, again

1589
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I think a region like Konami's home computing division

1590
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Is not where it used to be

1591
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
And I think is really ripe for the pickin'

1592
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Whoever releases the next Ridge Racer

1593
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Is gonna be the winner

1594
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It comes down to

1595
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
We need a new Ridge Racer game

1596
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Uh

1597
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Go ahead

1598
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Sorry, this is a great comment from Dungeon Buster

1599
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Live.vognetware.com

1600
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
They're building up their backlot

1601
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
The way Netflix is gobbling indie filmmakers

1602
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
That is an awesome comparison, in my opinion

1603
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah, unfortunately they don't release several

1604
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
New seasons of some shows

1605
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
That I really like that are indie filmmakers

1606
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
As well, but

1607
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
What are you gonna do?

1608
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Hey, it could be worse

1609
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
They could be buying EA or buying games

1610
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Or they could be like EA buying game companies

1611
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And then sucking them dry and then

1612
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Throwing them away

1613
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
You know what though, Netflix is the company that brought us

1614
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Chris Pine's dick, so you know what?

1615
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
All is forgiven

1616
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Okay

1617
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I did see that Chris Pine was in something

1618
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
So I will now not watch that

1619
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Well, your wife's gonna make you

1620
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
She's not gonna make me

1621
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
She's gonna give a shit about Chris Pine's dick

1622
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
No, I was gonna say

1623
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
SSG100Matt says

1624
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Never thought we'd talk about that tonight

1625
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
No, I was gonna say

1626
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
One game that I'm surprised we haven't seen Nintendo

1627
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Put out yet

1628
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
They have new games out in the arcade

1629
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Cruisin, the Cruisin series

1630
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Their latest one was a Cruisin

1631
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Blast or whatever it was

1632
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
That's a Nintendo game

1633
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
In the arcade

1634
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
They should put that on console

1635
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Why not?

1636
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
They should

1637
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Well, they should make some other racing games too

1638
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
But you know

1639
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Okay, for everybody in chat that's like

1640
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I don't wanna see that movie

1641
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I'm sure there's lots of titties as well

1642
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I haven't watched the movie myself

1643
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And let's be real, I'm not gonna watch the movie

1644
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I barely have time to play video games anymore

1645
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
This is what the internet's for

1646
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
The internet will screen capture that shit

1647
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Are you saying the internet is for porn?

1648
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm saying the internet is for

1649
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Finding things without having to suffer

1650
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Through the rest of it

1651
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says

1652
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah, that reminds me what Akuma said

1653
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Whatever happened to the supposed Ridge Racer sequel?

1654
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Well, there was the one that was on PC

1655
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Yeah

1656
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Alright, let's move home with some more stories

1657
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Going on to Loki

1658
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Alright

1659
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
And apparently with the Fallout

1660
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
PC beta going on

1661
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
People have already developed

1662
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Mods for it

1663
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So they have a mod called Hairspray

1664
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Which allows you to customize the hair color

1665
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Of your vault dweller

1666
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Beyond what is available in the game

1667
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Of course, this being

1668
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
An online game

1669
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
The only person that's gonna see that is you

1670
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
So it doesn't matter

1671
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
No one's gonna actually see that

1672
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
But apparently

1673
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
You know, there's other

1674
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Mods available

1675
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Like for example, there's one that has

1676
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
There's been actually several different Bethesda games

1677
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
But a lock picking bar

1678
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
So it shows you the sweet spot

1679
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
For picking a lock

1680
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Which allows you to pick a lock pretty easy

1681
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Without wasting too many value pins

1682
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
But I'm guessing

1683
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
That maybe they're gonna be

1684
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Patching the mount once the game comes out

1685
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Then again, who knows

1686
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
But

1687
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
What's ridiculous though, speaking of patching

1688
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Fallout 76

1689
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Is gonna be getting a day one patch

1690
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
That's actually larger than the game itself

1691
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
So

1692
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
The game

1693
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I think right now is

1694
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
About

1695
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Like 45 gigs

1696
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And the day one patch is gonna be

1697
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
54.64 gigabytes

1698
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Which is ridiculous

1699
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Goodbye bandwidth cap

1700
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Are we sure it's not like a patch that just bridges

1701
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
The gap between what's on the disk

1702
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
And maybe just a few gigabytes

1703
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Of the differences between

1704
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
That sounds like insane to me

1705
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I don't know

1706
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
But it's pretty bad

1707
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
That they have a patch that big

1708
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And I don't know what they're gonna be doing

1709
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I mean aside, they said a large number of bug fixes

1710
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
enhancements

1711
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Feature changes

1712
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
And

1713
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I don't know

1714
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So we'll see

1715
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And apparently they're working on

1716
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
You know, fighting off some

1717
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Hacking exploits

1718
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I don't think

1719
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
That much of what they're gonna do

1720
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Is gonna have any effect on that

1721
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I think it's gonna be a big ol' mess

1722
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I'll wait and see because it's not a game

1723
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I'm planning on picking up

1724
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Alright, I don't really

1725
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Super get into the Fallout series

1726
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
It's just one of those things

1727
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I don't like the fact that it's an online game

1728
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I'm kinda tired of that

1729
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I like Fallout being just like

1730
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Even like it was Skyrim

1731
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And that's kind of ironic because Skyrim

1732
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I would like that to be a multiplayer game

1733
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
That'd be fun

1734
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
But it'd be fun just as in co-op

1735
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Like I wanna play co-op with somebody

1736
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And play through Skyrim

1737
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
That would be fun

1738
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Kill me and nuke my shit

1739
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
No, that's not really

1740
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Entertaining for me

1741
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I don't know

1742
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Alright, well earlier in the show I brought up Mass Effect

1743
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
And what could be in the future of the franchise

1744
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And this past week we had

1745
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
N7 Day, I don't know if y'all know that

1746
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
But N7, which is kind of the name of the

1747
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Special Forces unit in Mass Effect

1748
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Is usually celebrated November 7th

1749
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And historically

1750
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Bioware used to do some big reveals

1751
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And announcements on N7 Day

1752
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
They've been down the past few years

1753
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Especially now that Andromeda's been out or what have you

1754
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
But they did come out

1755
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And say that on Bioware's official

1756
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Twitter they basically said

1757
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
They did this whole thing with the memories

1758
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
What the series means to them and all that

1759
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And also they did kinda stealth announce

1760
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
That an Xbox One X patch

1761
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
For Mass Effect Andromeda

1762
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Did go live

1763
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
So you get some 4K enhancements

1764
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
But if I remember right, Playstation Pro

1765
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Kinda had those already

1766
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
But this would bring it in parody

1767
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
With Playstation Pro and probably some of the same stuff

1768
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
That's in the PC version anyway

1769
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
But still cool

1770
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
It's nice for the people that are playing

1771
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
On the Xbox One that they get that

1772
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I guess it's better resolution

1773
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And HDR lighting, so probably just some of the same stuff

1774
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
From PC to be honest

1775
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
But anyway, Casey Hudson

1776
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Who's now the general manager of Bioware

1777
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
But of course he was a big part of the original trilogy

1778
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
He basically

1779
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Did kinda come out and say

1780
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
That

1781
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
The tweet text

1782
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Or whatever says that

1783
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
And Hudson talked about this saying that

1784
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
There's future Bioware games in Mass Effect

1785
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
In the Dragon Age series

1786
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
So Mass Effect is not dead

1787
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
There will be no

1788
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Killing of the franchise

1789
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
The quote that he said

1790
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
It means coming into the studio every day

1791
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Dreaming about what the next great Mass Effect game

1792
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Will be

1793
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So I guess they'll revisit it at some point in the future

1794
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
But I'm still not pre-ordering Anthem

1795
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
EA

1796
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
The way you treated Mass Effect's Andromeda

1797
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I'm not gonna be jumping up support

1798
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Anthem, so good luck

1799
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Good luck y'all

1800
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Just to give you hope on how EA is treating things

1801
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Isn't there like N7 armor available

1802
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
In Anthem or something? I heard about that

1803
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
No, I'm sure that's gonna be a thing

1804
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
But I was just gonna mention since it's not on our show roll

1805
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
You know there's a game called Battlefield 5

1806
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
That's coming out

1807
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I've heard of this game

1808
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
But

1809
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Oh god, it's the whole thing where it's like 3 weeks early

1810
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Or something like that

1811
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But if you subscribe to their PC service

1812
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That allows you to do all these games

1813
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
You get it like 10 days earlier

1814
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Oh, but if you order like the

1815
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Premium edition or whatever

1816
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Then you get a few days after that

1817
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
And then if you

1818
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Get just the base game

1819
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Well you're gonna have to wait until the 20th

1820
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Or whatever it is

1821
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Well, I hope EA has a 100%

1822
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Quality product on their hands

1823
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Because when that does release early

1824
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
The internet is gonna fucking tear it apart

1825
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Just like they did with Mass Effect Andromeda

1826
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And if the slightest thing is wrong with that game

1827
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
It will be under a microscope

1828
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Just like it was with Mass Effect Andromeda

1829
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
And basically what I'm saying is EA

1830
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You should've learned your fucking lesson already

1831
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Or Battlefront 2

1832
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I feel bad for the developers

1833
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I'm gonna leave it at that

1834
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I hope the game is 100%

1835
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
100.00%

1836
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Quality

1837
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Because any flaw in that is going to be under a microscope

1838
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
And then you're gonna get those fucking tweets

1839
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
That are like, I cancelled my pre-order

1840
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Because you fucking flopped this in Battlefield

1841
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And

1842
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I guess EA kind of forgot

1843
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
That like, the first week sales

1844
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Of a game is really important

1845
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And I'm sorry, all of these people

1846
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Are not gonna suddenly shell out twice as much

1847
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Money to play it three weeks early

1848
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It's ridiculous

1849
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
It is though

1850
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Anyway

1851
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

1852
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Rob was about to go on a Loki style rant

1853
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And Loki interrupts it to defuse it

1854
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I'm the only one who rants here, bitch

1855
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I don't think that's what you said

1856
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I didn't really have the full on rant

1857
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I said what I needed to say

1858
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
We'll just leave it at that

1859
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Alright, let's move on

1860
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So Sony's got this

1861
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Playstation classic that's gonna be coming out

1862
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
On December 3rd for $100

1863
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And of course they announced all their games with that

1864
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
And now with different websites

1865
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Kind of showing little previews

1866
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
On how it looks

1867
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
We get to see what exactly we're getting

1868
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
For $100

1869
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Well apparently the console is gonna be using

1870
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Standard USB controllers

1871
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
So the, you know, non-dual

1872
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Shock Playstation controllers

1873
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
So that's at least cool because maybe you can use that

1874
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
On your PC and stuff

1875
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
The other thing that's kind of interesting is that

1876
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
It's running an open source Playstation emulator

1877
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Called PCSX Re-Armed

1878
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
So

1879
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
They're using basically just a PC emulator

1880
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
On this console

1881
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
To emulate these games

1882
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Which begs the question

1883
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Why do I even want to buy this then?

1884
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Because it's cute

1885
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
It's not though

1886
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And they have like games from, it seems like from different

1887
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Regions as well, like they have the European

1888
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Version of

1889
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Let's see

1890
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
It says, yeah they said a lot of the games that they

1891
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Booted up on the Playstation classic were in the European

1892
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Version, so like Final Fantasy 7

1893
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
For example

1894
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Then also like

1895
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Grand Theft Auto

1896
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Yeah they're like

1897
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Click on a UK flag to display

1898
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
The text in English

1899
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I wonder though if that's not necessarily so much

1900
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
That's a European version of the game

1901
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Or if it's because DMA Designs at the time

1902
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Was a European company

1903
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
So, you know, it would make sense that they would have a

1904
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
European flag on there

1905
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I just don't know like

1906
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
It wouldn't be the first time I've seen the English

1907
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Language represented by that flag

1908
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
It's not like something to be

1909
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
It's not a news worthy

1910
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Piece of news in my opinion

1911
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
The thought is because the fact that it runs

1912
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
This emulator is probably why there's such

1913
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
A limited

1914
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Support for

1915
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
There's a limited amount of games on here because

1916
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
The games supported by the emulator

1917
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Aren't necessarily like the vast library

1918
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Also they're saying that

1919
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Some of the games like Ridge Racer Type 4

1920
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It has this like blurry

1921
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Dither defect on the text

1922
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Which probably looked good on a normal

1923
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
TV which I remember it looking fantastic

1924
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
On my old TV because I had a little 13

1925
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
CRT but now

1926
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Looks really blurry

1927
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And hard to read which yes that's how it

1928
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Looks like on my computer so

1929
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Interesting I don't know

1930
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
So you might want to

1931
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Cautiously wait for this

1932
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I think it's neat

1933
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
But

1934
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Do I really need another thing I could put

1935
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
NES games on?

1936
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I don't really

1937
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Bobby in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says

1938
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
The C64 Mini runs Vice

1939
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
This is a popular thing to just have these

1940
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Minis running emulators

1941
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
They want you to buy it because it's all packaged nicely

1942
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It's for people who are not tech

1943
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Masters and don't already have the emulators themselves

1944
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
He has a fair point

1945
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
It's you know it's supposed to be that

1946
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Attractive thing on the shelf that Grandma

1947
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Is buying you for the Christmas tree

1948
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And I get that and that's why the SNES

1949
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Classic and the

1950
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
NES Classic are fantastic because

1951
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Those games look great when it's upscaled

1952
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
On a TV

1953
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I gotta say though this is kind of the

1954
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Awkward generation the Nintendo 64

1955
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And Playstation 1

1956
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
It doesn't hold up as well

1957
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
The Nintendo 64 might be a little bit

1958
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Better because

1959
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Mario 64 is a great game

1960
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
But man

1961
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
It's rough

1962
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It's rough to look at

1963
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Maybe like the Playstation 2 classic emulator

1964
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Whenever that comes out someday

1965
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Maybe I'll be on board with that

1966
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Only if it has Magic Pen Gel

1967
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Magic Pen Gel

1968
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Hell yes

1969
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
And I don't know

1970
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Even the Japanese game lineup was way better too

1971
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I want an armored core

1972
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
God dammit

1973
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Alright well I know one

1974
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Game that

1975
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Bobby Blackwolf says

1976
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Playstation 3 classic has Eye of Judgment

1977
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Then it can be a million seller

1978
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Oh that's

1979
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Wouldn't that be great if all these years later

1980
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
The Playstation Eye

1981
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
They finally sell a million copies of Eye of Judgment

1982
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And by the time you're 50 years old

1983
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You have to dress up like Tingle

1984
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Motherfuckers

1985
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Alright

1986
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I bet there's so many people that listen

1987
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Well there's not a lot of people that listen to OLR

1988
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
But I bet there's enough now

1989
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
They probably don't even know what that joke was

1990
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
So we made this bet

1991
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
When the Playstation Eye was first announced

1992
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So it was a long time ago

1993
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
What were we calling it? The Brown Eye of Judgment or something like that?

1994
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
No it's because they had this game

1995
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
We saw it at E3

1996
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
We went to E3 and we saw it through a demonstration

1997
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
They're playing cards

1998
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
They're playing a card game and I'm like

1999
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I don't fucking understand why I need to buy this

2000
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
To play this stupid card game

2001
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Just play the card game

2002
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Why do I need to see the TV?

2003
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
So Loki took a bet and the bet was

2004
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
And he said if they sell a million copies of Eye of Judgment

2005
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
He would dress up as Tingle

2006
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
For the webcam that we had at the time

2007
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
And come to the show

2008
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
The closest we ever got was

2009
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
One holiday, one Halloween

2010
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
You came dressed up as Sackboy

2011
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
From Little Big Planet, remember that?

2012
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Yeah, I do remember that

2013
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
He had a really fancy little Sackboy card

2014
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
That was about as close as we got

2015
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
But we wanted you to be Tingle

2016
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Oh the other closest thing is that that Flappy

2017
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I always forget about Flappy Vog, it's been so long now

2018
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
There was also

2019
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
It was

2020
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
He was one of our old listeners

2021
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
He works at a game company

2022
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
That had a Kickstarter

2023
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And one of the

2024
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Kickstarter things was like if you got

2025
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I don't remember if it was likes

2026
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Or random drawing

2027
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Or donations or something like that

2028
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Someone would draw you in a certain style

2029
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So I had the girl draw me

2030
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Oh yes, I remember that

2031
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And then there was

2032
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I remember there was an episode

2033
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
It was the last episode we ever did on Live 365

2034
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Before we moved to All Games Radio

2035
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
That was a long time ago, right?

2036
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
That was before Vog, right?

2037
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
So there was

2038
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
We did a list list or something

2039
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
What could Live 365 do to get us to stay

2040
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
And I think one of the winning answers was

2041
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Purchase one million copies of the High of Judgement

2042
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
By the way

2043
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Oh my god

2044
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I love this

2045
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
This is so, this is recursive right now

2046
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So I'm actually looking at the Orange Lounge Radio

2047
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Wiki, because there is a wiki that

2048
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
The fans have done

2049
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I don't think I've ever edited an article

2050
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I don't even think I know how

2051
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
But there's actually a whole article

2052
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
On the Orange Lounge Radio wiki

2053
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.wiki.com

2054
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
About the High of Judgement bet

2055
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
On September 23, 2007

2056
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Wow, that's old

2057
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Loki exclaimed

2058
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
That there would be no way that the High of Judgement

2059
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Would sell any considerable amount of units

2060
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Upon hearing this

2061
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Rob in the chat room suggested

2062
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
That they should start a bet with Loki

2063
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Oh yeah, you want to take a bet on that?

2064
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
The bet was that if the High of Judgement

2065
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Could sell a considerable amount of units

2066
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Loki would dress up as Tingle

2067
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Loki accepted the bet and set the rules

2068
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
The High of Judgement must sell one million

2069
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Units in six months worldwide

2070
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
This was later changed from

2071
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Six months to all time, because then you got cocky

2072
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Yeah

2073
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
After the rules were set

2074
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Rob suggested another condition

2075
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
While dressed up as Tingle

2076
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Loki would play an online match of

2077
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Eye of Judgement with Bobby Blackwolf

2078
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And set the Playstation Eye on fire

2079
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
In the middle of the match

2080
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I don't even remember that, but that's awesome

2081
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Kudos me

2082
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And we would still totally do that

2083
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I know

2084
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I kind of feel like Loki would just

2085
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Do that for free without the Tingle outfit

2086
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Bobby, do you have a copy?

2087
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
On March 2, 2008

2088
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
At 9pm, Loki changed the bet

2089
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Once again

2090
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
And combined the sales

2091
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Requirement total with the game

2092
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Let's Ride Friends Forever

2093
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
For the bet

2094
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
But then

2095
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
On June 11, 2010

2096
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
The bet was declared over

2097
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Why did we do that?

2098
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Because I think it was never gonna, I don't know

2099
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
On November 11, 2018

2100
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
The bet was reopened

2101
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Can we get on that please?

2102
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
On November 11, 2018

2103
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
The bet was reopened

2104
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Because now there might be a Playstation 3

2105
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Classic some day

2106
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
By the way, they even, God

2107
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
You guys are so fucking awesome

2108
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
The final results

2109
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
304,769

2110
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Plus

2111
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
43,355 equals

2112
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
348,124

2113
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Note, VG charts did not have

2114
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Any sales information on the European version

2115
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Of Eye of Judgment

2116
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Or sales information on any version

2117
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Of Let's Ride Friends Forever that wasn't the DS

2118
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Version

2119
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Y'all fucking brought your receipts

2120
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I'm so fucking proud, thank you Wiki people

2121
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I'm checking right now

2122
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
If there's

2123
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
An actual copy of Eye of Judgment

2124
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
For sale on eBay that I can

2125
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Burn, oh hey, 1099

2126
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
That's not bad

2127
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Cuddlebucket in chat says

2128
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
This scenario needs to have Dark Sakura in the background

2129
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Looking disapprovingly

2130
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Are you kidding? She'll be handing him the match

2131
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I can get a

2132
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Complete set, including a Playstation

2133
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I can't because I don't know where the hell mine is

2134
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
For 2699

2135
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Wow

2136
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Maybe we'll just do it

2137
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
We'll be one more

2138
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
We'll do a Twitch stream some day

2139
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Loki almost

2140
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Since it sold a third of the requirements

2141
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Loki performs a third of the bet

2142
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And there was the

2143
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Eye of Judgment Legends which was on PSP

2144
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I just don't think it ever sold

2145
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
A significant amount of copies to count

2146
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Ugh

2147
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Alright

2148
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
S2100Matt says it ended production

2149
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was what

2150
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Caused us to say it was done

2151
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
But I'm sorry, that's not fun

2152
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
To end it, so it's reopen

2153
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
You just have to convince Sony

2154
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
To do it again

2155
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
What's the physical

2156
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Game company that, you know, they'll make

2157
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Physical copies of digital games

2158
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
You just have to convince them to do it

2159
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Oh, there you go, to make their own Eye of Judgment

2160
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Throwback

2161
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I love it, I love it

2162
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Anyhow

2163
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Let's move on

2164
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
To one more story here

2165
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

2166
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
And it has to do with another very modern VR

2167
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Game, and this game is a lot

2168
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Of fun as well

2169
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
It's not one you can just sit there on the couch and play

2170
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
But it's still fun, it's a game called Beat Saber

2171
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Excuse me, I had the hiccups

2172
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
The game is called Beat Saber

2173
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
And it's going to be coming out on the PlayStation 4

2174
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
On November 20th

2175
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Which made a lot of music fans

2176
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Chuckle, because November 20th

2177
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Is a date usually associated with Dance Dance Revolution

2178
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Because there's a song

2179
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
That, well actually it goes back to Beatmania

2180
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Over and over again in the Bomani franchise

2181
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Called 20 November, so

2182
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
And there was even a 19 November

2183
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
In one of the 2DX

2184
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Didn't they do a 21 November at some point?

2185
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I feel like that was a thing in 2DX

2186
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
At one point, I don't know

2187
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I think you're thinking of September

2188
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Maybe, I see what you did

2189
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Alright anyway, so Beat Saber is going to be coming out

2190
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
On November 20th, and of course

2191
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
This is the game that you play in VR

2192
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Where you slash beats that are coming at you

2193
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Sometimes you have to duck

2194
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Or move around

2195
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
The manifestations of walls

2196
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
And things like that

2197
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
And this game is also a little bit controversial

2198
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Because you're not just graded on

2199
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Special performance, but you are graded on style

2200
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
How much flourish do you have with your moves

2201
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
So it'll be very interesting

2202
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Also some features

2203
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
There's supposed to be some extra PlayStation

2204
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Exclusive tracks

2205
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Like 5 PlayStation exclusive tracks

2206
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
And there's going to be some brand new

2207
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Campaign mode that wasn't originally in the PC version

2208
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
But the makers of Beat Saber

2209
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Have been working hard on the port

2210
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I do believe they plan to go back to update the PC version

2211
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
To have the campaign mode

2212
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
I don't think it'll have the tracks, but modders

2213
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Will take care of that certainly

2214
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I mean if they put the fucking B movie

2215
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
In Beat Saber then they'll put these

2216
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
5 missing songs in as well

2217
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
You can all look for that on PC soon

2218
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
But for PlayStation 4 people who don't have

2219
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Oculus or HTC Vive

2220
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
You can check that out on your PlayStation VR on November 20th

2221
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I know I will be, because I

2222
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Really enjoyed Beat Saber when I played it on Bobby's

2223
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
HTC Vive when I was at Dragon Con

2224
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Earlier this year

2225
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Are you going to be looking into

2226
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Getting the Beat Saber

2227
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Maybe, I don't know

2228
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
You should, if nothing else check it out

2229
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Check it out over here

2230
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
After I get it and see what you think

2231
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
So there you go, by the way

2232
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
The wiki has already been updated, somebody did put on there

2233
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
On November 11th the bet was reopened

2234
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Thank you, appreciate that

2235
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
It won't matter

2236
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
You're getting cocky over there Loki

2237
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Getting cocky, alright

2238
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I guess it's time we go to the classic game of the week

2239
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
What do you say? Sure

2240
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
And so we take

2241
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
A step into that portal that's marked

2242
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Radio Magic, and we end up

2243
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
With the one and only Dark Sakura joining us

2244
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
For the classic game of the week, hi Jamie

2245
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Oh hi

2246
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Hi, how are you doing?

2247
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I'm okay

2248
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
It's kind of

2249
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Headachy with all the smoke outside

2250
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Oh yeah, I'm sure we will have

2251
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Addressed it in the show before this point

2252
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
But the smoke here is like terrible

2253
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And obviously the disaster that's going on out there

2254
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Is really really terrible

2255
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
The effect it's having on so so so

2256
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Much of the state is crazy

2257
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Yeah I saw

2258
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
The pictures online just from downtown

2259
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And that haze of brown was really

2260
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Frightening, yeah it's like brown fog

2261
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
But anyway on a somewhat

2262
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Lighter note, something that we do

2263
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
When it's smokey outside is we stay inside

2264
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
And we play lots of video games on a lazy

2265
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Day, but once a week Dark Sakura

2266
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Likes to find a game that she thinks, hey

2267
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
You know what, you need to respect the classics

2268
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Put down your newfangled Playstation VRs

2269
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And pick up a classic

2270
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
It's the classic game of the week

2271
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Dark Sakura, what did you pick for this week's

2272
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Classic game of the week

2273
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Metal Gear

2274
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Metal Gear

2275
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I can't do the David Hayter voice

2276
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Well and to be fair, David Hayter

2277
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Did not voice Metal Gear on the

2278
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
NES, which most people

2279
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Are probably familiar with, although

2280
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Not really where Metal Gear got its start

2281
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Right?

2282
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Yeah, well actually it didn't even get its start on the NES

2283
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Right

2284
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Metal Gear first came out in 1987

2285
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
For the MSX2 computer

2286
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
In Japan and Europe

2287
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
It is the

2288
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Actually considered to be the

2289
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Progenitor of the stealth genre

2290
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
And it was the first video game

2291
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Designed by Hideo Kojima

2292
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Who went on to do all the later ones

2293
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Well most of the later ones

2294
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
The Metal Gear 2

2295
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
That we got on

2296
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
NES was not the real

2297
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Metal Gear 2

2298
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
He had nothing to do with it

2299
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
The game, the original game

2300
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Was reworked for the Famicom

2301
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And then that was the one that got

2302
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Internationally released and it was developed

2303
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Without Kojima and had

2304
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Some drastically altered level

2305
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Designs and a bunch of changes

2306
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
There's a more faithful port

2307
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Of the MSX2 version that came out

2308
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Metal Gear Solid 3

2309
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Subsistent to Playstation 2

2310
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And the HD edition that came out

2311
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
The PS3, Xbox 360, and PlayStation V

2312
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
They also had

2313
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
A revised translation

2314
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I really want to play that version someday

2315
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I have never played that version

2316
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I loved Metal Gear NES as a kid

2317
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
And of course as a kid you don't realize how butchered the game was

2318
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
From its MSX version

2319
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
So I really want to play this

2320
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Other remake someday

2321
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I can lend it to you

2322
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Sweet

2323
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
The game itself

2324
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
It revolves around a fallen snake

2325
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Foxhound

2326
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Who's on a solo infiltration mission

2327
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
To go into the state of Outer Heaven

2328
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And destroy Metal Gear

2329
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Which is a bipedal walking tank

2330
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
It can launch nuclear missiles

2331
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Anywhere

2332
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And so that's bad

2333
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
So you play around with the snake

2334
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
And you have different modes

2335
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
And one of them is the alert mode

2336
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Where the enemies

2337
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
See where you are

2338
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
So basically a snake is seen and there's only

2339
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Exclamation point over the enemy

2340
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Then

2341
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Only the enemies on the present screen

2342
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Will attack and you can just avoid them

2343
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
By going to the other screen

2344
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
But if two exclamation marks appear

2345
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Then they trigger an alarm

2346
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
That brings in reinforcements

2347
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Which you can escape from

2348
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
By killing all of the enemies

2349
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Or going outdoors or entering an elevator

2350
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
You start the mission unarmed

2351
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
So you can get

2352
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
You know, it's on-site procurement

2353
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
All of the things that you need

2354
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
While you're going through there

2355
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
You also have limited ammo

2356
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
You have to find ammo caches

2357
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Or stealing from other people

2358
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
You can also get a suppressor

2359
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
That can allow you to use a handgun

2360
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And some machine gun without making a noise

2361
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Some weapons are used

2362
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
To clear obstacles

2363
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Like having hollow walls

2364
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
And electrified floors

2365
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
You can also punch people in the face

2366
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Which is awesome

2367
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
So you can also defeat

2368
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
A guard by punching him in the back

2369
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Which is, I guess, the back-end

2370
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Version of the strangle that we had

2371
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
In the later games

2372
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
And then you also get

2373
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Different mercenaries who will

2374
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Challenge you when they're at the boss characters

2375
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
In each level

2376
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
So you also got multiple floors

2377
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
And multiple places around here

2378
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Really the PlayStation remake

2379
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Really did a good job

2380
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Of bringing in that

2381
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
That vastness that you felt in the first game

2382
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
You also get a transceiver

2383
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
That you can use to talk to

2384
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Your commanding officer

2385
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Big boss

2386
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Or other members of the resistance

2387
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Such as Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer

2388
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Each of his allies

2389
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Gives them certain

2390
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Tips

2391
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
They specialize in different subjects

2392
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Although you don't always get a reply

2393
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
When you talk to them

2394
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
The MSX2 version

2395
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
They used a tape recorder

2396
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
To save your game progress

2397
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Or a Game Master 2 cartridge

2398
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
That you would save via floppy disk

2399
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Later on, they were all stored locally

2400
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Like on memory cards and describes

2401
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
So

2402
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
You have different

2403
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Your bosses include Shoot Gunner

2404
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Who is renamed Shot Maker

2405
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Who is a Spetsnaz agent

2406
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Machine Gun Kid

2407
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Fire Trooper

2408
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Coward Duck

2409
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Arnold

2410
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Bloody Brad

2411
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And a couple of androids

2412
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
And another mercenary

2413
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
From Outer Heaven

2414
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Who you don't find out until the end

2415
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
So really

2416
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
It was just a pretty amazing game

2417
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I mean, it was

2418
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Kazuma was actually asked to take over the project

2419
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
And it was supposed to be an action game

2420
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
With modern military combat

2421
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
But the MSX was really limited

2422
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
In what it could do

2423
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
So inspired by The Great Escape

2424
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
He reversed it

2425
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
To focus

2426
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
To avoiding capture

2427
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
And so

2428
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
That's where the stealth aspect came in

2429
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
The packaging

2430
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Has Solid Snake holding a gun

2431
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
And it was actually traced back

2432
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
To a publicity still of Michael

2433
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Bean posing as Kyle Reese for Terminator

2434
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
And

2435
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Kazuma didn't take the picture

2436
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
But if you go back and look at it

2437
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Even I think got the same art here in the US

2438
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
But yeah

2439
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
You can like, is that Michael Bean?

2440
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Is that from Terminator?

2441
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Even I thought that as a kid, you know

2442
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
So

2443
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
As far as different releases, we did have the

2444
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
MSX2 version, we had the Famicom version

2445
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Which was of course

2446
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Completely altered

2447
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
There was the MS-DOS and Commodore 64 version

2448
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
They were based off the NES ones

2449
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And the MSX2 one

2450
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
The subsistence

2451
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Came out and it was the re-release

2452
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Of the MSX2 one

2453
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
That had an updated

2454
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Version

2455
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Original and easy difficulty settings

2456
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Name changes for characters

2457
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
A boss survival mode

2458
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
That you get after clearing the game

2459
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
A hidden bandana item

2460
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
That gives you infinite ammo

2461
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Enemy bosses

2462
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
That flash red and white when they sustain damage

2463
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Snake cigarettes, drain his life gauge

2464
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Which they did in a later game

2465
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Messages

2466
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Are now displayed when the player

2467
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Attempts to pick more rations and ammunition

2468
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
After reaching maximum capacity

2469
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
And a result screen is added to the game

2470
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
That rates your performance

2471
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
It is actually

2472
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Metal Gear was

2473
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Actually one of the 20th best selling

2474
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
MSX games in Japan for 5 months

2475
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
And it debuted at number 4

2476
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
And peaked at number 3

2477
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
They said the game was rapidly

2478
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Addicting

2479
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
The NES version was also

2480
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Rates number 104

2481
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
In the best made Nintendo

2482
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Games of their top 200

2483
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
It led to

2484
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Sequels, there was Snake's Revenge

2485
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
For NES which wasn't really

2486
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
In the thing

2487
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Metal Gear Solid 2 Solid Snake

2488
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Was developed by Kojima and released

2489
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
In Japan for MSX2

2490
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
The same year because we really

2491
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Wanted more Metal Gear

2492
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
And then of course

2493
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Solid was the next one to come after that

2494
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Which honestly

2495
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
I mean it was a really really

2496
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Great game. For different media

2497
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
There were books that came out

2498
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
There was a Metal Gear book

2499
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
That was done by Scholastic Books for World of Power

2500
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
There was a game book adaptation

2501
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
In Japan

2502
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
In the second installment of the Konami Game Book

2503
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Series. It was set years after the

2504
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Events of the game were followed because it called back

2505
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Into Fox Town to do more

2506
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Metal Gear shenanigans

2507
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
There were the remakes

2508
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
There's an official and an unofficial

2509
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
There is a mod for Alien Swarm

2510
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
That was created

2511
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
By Konami with

2512
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Permission as long as they didn't make

2513
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
A profit but it was cancelled on June 3, 2014

2514
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And David Hader was supposed to

2515
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Voice call a snake in it

2516
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
And there's another fan remake

2517
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
That's in development using Unreal Engine 4

2518
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Called Outer Heaven

2519
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And there you go

2520
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
That's out of gear

2521
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Yeah this game obviously left quite a bit of a

2522
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Legacy but yeah

2523
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Seriously one of my all time favorites on the NES

2524
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Which is weird because I never got

2525
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
As into the later

2526
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Metal Gear Solid series. I certainly don't have

2527
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Anything against it. I just didn't really like

2528
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Have the money

2529
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
To buy or play the earlier games

2530
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Then I just kind of fell behind on the series

2531
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
It's one of those things I'm always like

2532
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I'll have to get back to that on a rainy day at some point

2533
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I just never have but the original

2534
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
On the NES for me because again I knew no better

2535
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
As a kid about MSX or any of that stuff

2536
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Is just a true classic

2537
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I didn't even know there was a Commodore 64 version

2538
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Until you just mentioned it. That's crazy

2539
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I have to play that someday

2540
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Well and the other thing too is that

2541
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
You know there is Metal Gear Solid

2542
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
From Bleed

2543
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Oh yeah yeah yeah the whole Dreamcast

2544
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Thing yeah

2545
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
So if you want we can lend

2546
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
You our Bleedcast version

2547
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
That might be fun

2548
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And the disc if you want to play through it

2549
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
It might make a fun livestream at some point

2550
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Well anyway there it is

2551
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Your classic game of the week Metal Gear for the NES

2552
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Dark Sakura

2553
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
We're not going to be here next week of course

2554
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Due to my trip out to Las Vegas

2555
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
So that means this is the last show before the

2556
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Thanksgiving holiday so I thought I'd

2557
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Close out tonight by asking you

2558
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
What are you thankful for Dark Sakura?

2559
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Um

2560
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Respirators

2561
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Music

2562
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Music

2563
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Music

2564
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Good old Dark Sakura thank you for joining us

2565
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
How you can during this

2566
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Time that she's got a work conflict

2567
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Going on here. Anyway I'm back here

2568
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
With Loki and it was brought up in chat

2569
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
While we were listening to Jamie's segment there

2570
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
It was brought up in chat that

2571
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
We had not discussed Pokemon Go

2572
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
During our gaming weeks like a first

2573
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
But you

2574
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Okay so I'm sure you did too

2575
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Pokemon Go community day happened

2576
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I went to a new place

2577
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Because of all the smoke outside we went to the mall

2578
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Instead of the capital where we used to go

2579
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
We went to a big mall out in Roseville

2580
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
And actually it worked out really well

2581
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Yeah I have spotty GPS in there usually

2582
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
It did bounce around

2583
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And that made it very frustrating when we tried to do

2584
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Because there's a Sprint store in there and it's an

2585
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
EX eligible gym

2586
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Alan still didn't have Giratina the legacy raid

2587
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
So one popped on that gym during

2588
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Community day and I was bouncing all around

2589
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
It was really frustrating but we finally got it

2590
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
He got his Giratina and now

2591
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
We're also potentially eligible for an

2592
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
EX raid out there next time

2593
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Deoxys passes go out so we'll see

2594
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I mean if they do it during the week

2595
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
There's no way I can go out there but Alan

2596
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Might be able to go and get his Deoxys

2597
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
So we'll see

2598
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I didn't necessarily just want to talk about Pokemon Go

2599
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Because another game that you and I have spent

2600
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
An awful lot of time playing, Ingress

2601
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Went through some big changes this week as well

2602
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
We didn't even really address that at the top of the show

2603
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Especially because I don't think either one of us are huge fans

2604
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Of the changes but Loki why don't you

2605
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Tell us what's going on with Ingress and what you think

2606
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
So

2607
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Basically they released

2608
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
The app called Ingress Prime

2609
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Which is the new

2610
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Version of the Ingress

2611
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Client I guess

2612
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
They redeveloped the whole thing in Unity

2613
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
So they remade it from scratch

2614
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
So it looks fancier now but everything is rearranged

2615
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
And I don't know if it's necessarily easier to use

2616
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I find it's not easier to use

2617
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
But that's because I'm used to the old app

2618
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Yeah the muscle memory takes a long

2619
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Time to change but people who are new to it

2620
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Will probably be like oh this is fancy

2621
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
You know can do that. Recharging is

2622
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Certainly a hell of a lot easier I'll give them that

2623
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Yeah so there's some things that are

2624
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
There's an advantage too but

2625
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
So like I don't know

2626
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
I've just been having some issues with it

2627
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Because like I

2628
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Decided to get the redacted app as well

2629
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Which the redacted app is the old app

2630
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
It's just kind of like in

2631
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
So they upgraded the old app

2632
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Automatically to the new version

2633
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
But then Niantic also said because we know the new version

2634
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Some of you are going to have some problems getting used to it

2635
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
It may be buggy and stuff like that

2636
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
We're going to release this new thing called Scanner Redacted

2637
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Which is the 1.0 app

2638
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
But you can only use Scanner Redacted

2639
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
If you had an account already

2640
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
And then on top of all that

2641
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
On top of all that because people are like

2642
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
New Scanner, I don't know about that

2643
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
They also in their store

2644
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
That they've always had a store where you could

2645
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Just like you know this fake money

2646
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
And you usually buy portal frackers with it

2647
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Which allows you to get double the

2648
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Output of when you hack a portal

2649
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Or you can get like little beacons and stuff

2650
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
It's just crap that you put above it

2651
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
You can bling out your

2652
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Portal or whatever

2653
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Sorry I have to respond to this comment in chat

2654
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Over at alive.vognetware.com

2655
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Sounds like old guys bitching

2656
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Isn't that like any gaming podcast?

2657
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Yes we are old guys

2658
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
What's the problem?

2659
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
To be fair he didn't say it was a problem

2660
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
He just said it sounds like old guys bitching

2661
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Yes we're old guys bitching

2662
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Continue your bitching

2663
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Here's the other thing though

2664
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
It's kind of like they've been having some issues

2665
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
With the new scanner

2666
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
For example I

2667
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Just out of the whim

2668
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Just went ahead and checked out

2669
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Oh hey let's see what this looks like

2670
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
So I pulled up the

2671
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Redacted scanner

2672
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
And took a look at my area

2673
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I'm like hey there's some fields here

2674
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
And I put the new scanner in

2675
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And I'm like wait a second I don't see some of these fields

2676
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
What the hell

2677
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
And so I took screenshots of that

2678
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
And there's definitely a discrepancy between that

2679
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Oh and then they have like in their store

2680
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Like I said where you can buy the portal frackers

2681
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
And stuff like that which that wasn't a big deal

2682
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Because it didn't really change the game too much

2683
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Oh now you can buy

2684
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Gear in the store

2685
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Now granted

2686
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I don't know if they've dropped down like

2687
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
The levels but like the gear that you can buy now

2688
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Is level 6 gear

2689
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
And not you know level 8

2690
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Or level 7 or whatever it was

2691
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
People were very mad about that that's for sure

2692
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
So I don't know

2693
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
But it's still there

2694
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Whether it's a limited amount of time

2695
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Or whatever but I

2696
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I would just like the game to be as snappy

2697
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
As the old one like I don't know about you

2698
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
But like when I go to make a link it is so

2699
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Slow

2700
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Like it takes forever

2701
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I love like when you actually make the link

2702
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
And I love how it shows what it will look like

2703
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Like there are improvements that I really like

2704
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
But just like oh my god it's so slow

2705
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
But you know the thing that they're teasing us

2706
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Because you know I just hit max level in Ingress over the summer

2707
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
So you know what they're teasing us with now right

2708
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
So they put in this

2709
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
So the question was always going to be

2710
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Is Ingress going to put in levels above 16

2711
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
And it looks like the answer is no

2712
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
What they are going to do is

2713
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Recursion

2714
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Recursive Ingress

2715
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
So now that you know hooray

2716
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I spent four and a half years

2717
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
To hit max level in Ingress

2718
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
And Ingress is now like bitch you thought

2719
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Now you can Recurse and go all the way back to level 1

2720
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
And it's like prestige

2721
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Right

2722
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Basically they brought the prestige system into

2723
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Ingress

2724
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
So I'm going to do it

2725
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
But it's just

2726
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Like a lot of people on my team are doing it

2727
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
And I was kind of sitting there going

2728
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I don't think this is a good idea

2729
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
For the entire team to reset

2730
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
To level 1 at the same time

2731
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
So I'm going to wait a little bit

2732
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Until some of you get up in level

2733
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
And in case any gigantic

2734
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Blue fields go up over town

2735
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Like somebody can

2736
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Respond to it

2737
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Because I didn't think it was perhaps the greatest idea

2738
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
For the entire team to Recurse all at once

2739
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
But that's exactly what happened which kind of cracked me up

2740
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I think they should all Recurse

2741
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Well eventually they probably will

2742
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
So

2743
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Siya Tabiri says Ingress new game plus

2744
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
That's kind of what it is

2745
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Kind of what a new game plus

2746
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
So anyway

2747
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Yeah the Ingress Prime

2748
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Client is just bugging me right now

2749
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
But like I'm excited what it will look like in 3 months

2750
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Once they've been able to bug fix it

2751
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Because clearly

2752
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
God this thing has been in development for a while

2753
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
And clearly whatever beta they had wasn't enough to bug fix it

2754
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
So it'll be, it's weird too

2755
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
They're taking all their bug feedback through

2756
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Reddit

2757
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
So you can go to reddit.com

2758
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Slash r slash Ingress Prime feedback

2759
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
And that's like the unofficial

2760
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
But official Ingress Prime feedback forum

2761
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
It's weird

2762
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Anyway, alright we'll stop bitching

2763
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
About a mobile phone game and we'll get

2764
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Back into some rapid fire news

2765
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Loki, what do you want to talk about for rapid fire news tonight?

2766
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Alright well this is kind of a cool

2767
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Freebie with the whole announcement

2768
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Of the release date of Crackdown 3

2769
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Microsoft is giving away

2770
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Crackdown, free for this month

2771
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
So go download it

2772
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Or go add it to your library even though I

2773
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Already have it

2774
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
But you can do it

2775
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Anyways

2776
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
So go do it

2777
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
If you don't already, it's a fun game

2778
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Find those orbs

2779
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
And then of course

2780
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
With no

2781
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
PlayStation event around the corner

2782
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
We have to look forward to of course

2783
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
The Game Awards 2018

2784
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
That's the largest lineup of new game

2785
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Announcements in the show's history

2786
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Which they had a lot of announcements

2787
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Before so I'm curious to see what they're

2788
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Going to show off this year

2789
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
It's going to take place 6th of

2790
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
December

2791
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
So we'll have to find out

2792
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
What's going to be there, obviously

2793
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Kojima's going to be there in print

2794
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Well the fact that they don't have a PlayStation

2795
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Experience this year kind of means I think

2796
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Some of those announcements will roll over to this

2797
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
So I think that's probably one reason why they're

2798
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Having a really good year for announcements is because

2799
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
There's no PlayStation experience

2800
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
And then

2801
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Microsoft didn't really like

2802
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Bring the house down with anything

2803
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Besides the studio acquisitions

2804
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
They announced that X018

2805
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Was a big deal but they didn't really do

2806
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Any new game announcements so even

2807
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Out of Microsoft's camp they might have

2808
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Something in store for Game Rewards which could be interesting

2809
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
And the Game Awards they said the

2810
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Cut off is going to be

2811
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Mid November

2812
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I'm like well yeah

2813
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Smash comes out like a couple of days before

2814
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Yeah no it sucks but Smash is not

2815
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Going to be eligible but Tetris Effect is

2816
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
I'm just saying

2817
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
We all know Red Red Redemption and God of War

2818
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Is going to win everything anyway but I hope

2819
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Tetris Effect gets like

2820
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Is there a category for pretty?

2821
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
There's music

2822
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Yeah it seems like a shoo-in for music that's for sure

2823
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Alright well heading

2824
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Over to the Nintendo Switch

2825
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
And it's online system

2826
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Of course the Nintendo Switch online

2827
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
That's something they're updating monthly with

2828
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
New games so November's

2829
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Games are on their way they will be out on

2830
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
November 14th and that is when

2831
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Twinbee, Mighty Bomb Jack

2832
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
And Metroid will be released that is what

2833
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Nintendo announced the specific day for that this week

2834
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Obviously I know I'm very excited about

2835
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Metroid. Mighty Bomb Jack

2836
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
In my opinion was kind of garbage

2837
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Especially compared to the original Bomb Jack

2838
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Arcade game. Twinbee is

2839
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
A very interesting pick because we got that

2840
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Here in the US is Stinger

2841
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
But my understanding is we are getting

2842
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Twinbee so it's going to be like the Japanese

2843
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Version basically

2844
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
No word yet if there might be a bonus

2845
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Thing because Nintendo did

2846
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
No announcement or ramp up

2847
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
For that Zelda

2848
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
What the hell did they call it? The Zelda

2849
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
You can buy everything now or whatever the hell

2850
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
It was called. Zelda Easy Mode

2851
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Basically so it would be interesting

2852
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Maybe if Metroid gets something like that or maybe

2853
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
One of the other games that already exist

2854
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
They should totally I mean I know

2855
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
It's so against you know their

2856
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I don't know

2857
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Mantra but they should totally

2858
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Put Game Genie support back in those games

2859
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Because that would be awesome

2860
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I know that Game Genie

2861
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Wasn't necessarily

2862
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Their thing but I mean

2863
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
It would be nice

2864
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Twinbee was never released in the US I thought it was

2865
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Stinger

2866
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I thought they renamed it and put it out here

2867
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
They probably changed it a bit too

2868
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
In Light Force or something

2869
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Oh OrangeRite says Stinger was Twinbee

2870
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Too oh my bad I thought that's how

2871
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
It worked okay thank you OrangeRite

2872
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Alright

2873
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Anyhow other news out of

2874
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Nintendo include a Super Smash

2875
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Brothers Ultimate demo

2876
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Starting actually this past weekend

2877
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Was a chance for you to go

2878
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Check out Super Smash Brothers Ultimate

2879
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
At your local mall

2880
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Some locations include

2881
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
The mall of Georgia

2882
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I don't know if that's anywhere near Bobby

2883
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Del Amo Fashion Center

2884
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
In Torrance California which is nowhere near us

2885
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Westfield Valley Fair

2886
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
In Santa Clara California

2887
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
That's probably the closest one on the list

2888
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
To us and I'm not

2889
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Going to go out there to stand

2890
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
All fucking day to play like one match

2891
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I'm not going to do it but maybe you want to go

2892
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
To a place like Schomburg Illinois

2893
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Illinois excuse me Houston Texas

2894
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Orlando Florida

2895
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Bloomington Minnesota

2896
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
New York the King of Prussia Mall in Pennsylvania

2897
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000

Ortyses Corner of Virginia which is all these places

2899
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000

Labo

2913
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Even though that's been out for a little bit

2914
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I'm sure Nintendo would love to see that show up

2915
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Under lots of Christmas trees

2916
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And menorahs everywhere

2917
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Yeah it's true

2918
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Going in chat over at

2919
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf

2920
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Talking about that mall says

2921
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
That's where I used to play Drummania in the early 2000's

2922
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
They had a Percussions Freaks 4th

2923
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Mix at the Vans Skatepark

2924
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
I was the guy playing that

2925
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
While everyone else was playing DDR

2926
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I had all the high scores there

2927
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
And you turned that into actual

2928
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Drumming

2929
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I'm sure it had

2930
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Nothing to do with your actual drumming experience

2931
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Lending itself very well to

2932
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Drummania or Percussion Freaks as the case may be

2933
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Alright anyhow let's move

2934
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
On to release dates and travel

2935
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Around the world and check out what is coming out

2936
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
This week in stores and I imagine

2937
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
There might be a little bit this week

2938
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Going up towards Black Friday

2939
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000

01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000

Alright

2968
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Well then we'll travel to Japan

2969
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
And check out some releases coming out over there

2970
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Even though of course the shopping seasons are not

2971
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Quite the same over there

2972
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
But I do believe they have some releases

2973
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
This week in Japan, yes on the PlayStation 4

2974
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000

Steam Dungeon

2976
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
That is in a

2977
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Regular and a limited edition

2978
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Just so we're clear

2979
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
What's in the limited edition?

2980
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Limited Things

2981
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
What's the dungeon crawler?

2982
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Actually you're exactly right

2983
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
It is a dungeon crawler

2984
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
So it's not just a clever name

2985
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
It looks like it might be cute

2986
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
But I doubt it will ever come out over here

2987
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
RPG Maker MV Trinity

2988
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Is out in Japan this week

2989
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
On November 15th

2990
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
As is Hitman 2's Japanese release

2991
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
And Fallout 76 is getting a Japanese release

2992
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
So you can look forward to all of that this week

2993
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
That is the PlayStation 4

2994
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I'm checking out the Nintendo Switch real quick

2995
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000

2996
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000

Is a price reduced game this week

2999
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
So it kind of gets a price reduction this week

3000
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
And then the Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee

3001
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Are also out in Japan this week

3002
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
As well as the Monster Ball Plus

01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Accessory as they're calling it there

3004
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Lots of little accessories

3005
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
The GameCube controller

3006
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000

For those of you who want to design on the go

01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
How about Europe, Loki?

3013
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Alright, so in Europe we have

That's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

3033
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000

It's also actually a busy week in our mailbag

3063
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Very excited, you know, sometimes

3064
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Sometimes I'm sitting here going, no emails

3065
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Womp womp

3066
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
It was because of the RuPaul Drag Race talk

3067
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
They did it, it did the trick

3068
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I guilted, no we got a lot of emails tonight

3069
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I'm actually thrilled, so we have a lot of stuff to talk about

3070
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
We have four emails, for us

3071
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000

3072
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000

First email tonight from Martin

01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Our friendly neighborhood, Belgian

3077
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
And it's going to be talking about a subject

3078
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
That we've already discussed a little bit tonight

3079
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
But let's get Martin's take on it

3080
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
So hello LR, your friendly Belgian Martin here

3081
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Just wanted to talk to you about

3082
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
EA's Battlefield 5 release date shenanigans

3083
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
The following is what release schedule looks like

3084
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
EA Access basic subscribers

3085
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
For $5 a month

3086
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Get to play 10 hour trial

3087
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
From November 9

3088
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
EA Access premier subscribers

3089
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
For $15 a month get to play the full game November 9

3090
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Pre-orders of the deluxe edition

3091
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
$80 get to play November 15

3092
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Regular people who just buy the game

3093
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
$60 get to play November 20

3094
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
So let me get this straight

3095
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I paid $60 for the basic version of the game

3096
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
And I have to wait almost two weeks

3097
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
After release to play

3098
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Even if you've pre-ordered the deluxe version of the game

3099
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
For $80 you still have to wait a week

3100
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Sure they call it early access for origin subscribers

3101
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
But let's face it

3102
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
The game is finished, it's out

3103
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
They're just delaying release

3104
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Unless you pay up more money

3105
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
I find it very obnoxious

3106
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
And I believe it harms the player base in the long run

3107
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Keep up the great show, take care

3108
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Martin from Belgium

3109
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Thank you so much for the email as always

3110
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
This has been something they've been doing for a while

3111
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Granted this is a little worse

3112
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
But before they had the whole EA

3113
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Access thing with

3114
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
The consoles where they would allow you

3115
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
To play the game a few days earlier

3116
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Before release

3117
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Martin here's my opinion straight up

3118
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
This system killed

3119
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Mass Effect Andromeda

3120
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
So why EA is still doing it

3121
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Is beyond me

3122
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
And I say it killed Mass Effect Andromeda

3123
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Because when they put it out on early access

3124
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
That's when suddenly it was like

3125
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Oh my god look at all these graphical bugs

3126
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
When in reality the graphical bugs

3127
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Were like honestly it wasn't

3128
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
It was probably better than most Bethesda games

3129
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
But Bethesda doesn't do this

3130
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
The problem is they take those

3131
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
They take those micro clips

3132
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Those seconds

3133
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
And it's look at what a garbage game

3134
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Mass Effect Andromeda is

3135
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
And it ruined it

3136
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
And it was because of this fuckery

3137
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
So why EA is continuing to do it

3138
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Kind of blows my fucking mind

3139
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
But I guess Battlefield

3140
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Is a very different type of game

3141
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
And as I kind of referenced earlier in the show

3142
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
If they have 100% confidence

3143
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
That Twitter isn't going to be filled with all these

3144
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Hot takes on fuck ups in the game

3145
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Then I guess they can get away with it

3146
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
But at the end of the day

3147
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Money talks

3148
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
So if you pay for it

3149
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
They're going to do it again

3150
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
It's only really an option

3151
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
The origin thing is only an option if you're on PC anyway

3152
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
So if you don't have a PC that can run these games

3153
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Then you're kind of out of luck

3154
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Unless you do just the EA

3155
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
I don't even know if they're still doing their Game Pass type thing

3156
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Does this open it up to piracy?

3157
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
That's the other kind of thing

3158
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I'm surprised these games don't get ripped apart

3159
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I assume there must be some component of the cloud

3160
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
The online service

3161
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
That's totally possible

3162
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I wouldn't probably say that

3163
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I mean, I know

3164
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Hackers going to hack, right?

3165
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
But I'm kind of surprised with the PC version

3166
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
It doesn't open itself up to piracy

3167
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
There must be enough of it that relies on the online piece

3168
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
That you can't yank it off the EA access servers

3169
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I wouldn't say that

3170
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Because it's already on the torrent sites

3171
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
So, uh, yeah

3172
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
So, I would question EA's

3173
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
I mean, I would never advocate for piracy

3174
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
I'm not saying to pirate it

3175
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
But I'm just surprised

3176
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
That when that becomes a factor

3177
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
That EA still kind of lets this happen

3178
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Maybe they haven't cracked it yet

3179
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
But they've got it out there

3180
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
But let's be real guys

3181
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
This could be a place the industry is headed

3182
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
It's not unique to EA

3183
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Microsoft just did it with Forza

3184
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Did they not?

3185
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
It's happened before

3186
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
If you don't like it, don't buy it

3187
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
I implore you, no matter what the game is

3188
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
No matter what it is

3189
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Now, let's go on to another email from Elliot B

3190
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Who we haven't heard from in a while

3191
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
It's very good to hear from you, Elliot

3192
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Hey, OLR, I can't decide whether to get excited about Pokemon Go or not

3193
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
I've bought almost every generation of Pokemon

3194
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I think he means Pokemon Let's Go

3195
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Because that's where the rest of this email goes

3196
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I've bought almost every generation of Pokemon

3197
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
All the way back to Blue

3198
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
And sunk over 100 hours into Sapphire

3199
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
But every game since

3200
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
I get bored of the same old mechanics halfway through

3201
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I'm hoping that the Pokemon Let's Go games

3202
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Add some fresh ideas

3203
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
That don't just feel like throwaway novelties

3204
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
What do you guys think?

3205
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Will you pick it up?

3206
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
I'm especially interested to hear Rob's opinion

3207
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
As a dedicated Pokemon Go player

3208
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Elliot B, thank you

3209
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
And here's my opinion

3210
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
I am really psyched about it

3211
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I'm jazzed about it, to play it

3212
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Because in my opinion

3213
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
The grind for hunting in the grass

3214
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
For a particular Pokemon

3215
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
And doing the random encounter battles

3216
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Starts to feel really grindy

3217
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
And that's where the Pokemon games start to lose me

3218
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I understand some people are really into that

3219
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
And that's cool

3220
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
But I do have that part of my brain that's like

3221
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
No, you have to catch them all

3222
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Before you move on, even as much as

3223
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Shane and other Pokemon fans

3224
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
That I know tell me, Rob, don't do that to yourself

3225
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
You should just ruin the game for yourself

3226
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
And I always inevitably ruin it for myself

3227
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
So my point is, the fact that they've

3228
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Replaced that kind of grinding

3229
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
With a

3230
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Ball tossing

3231
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Kind of like different style that they've taken

3232
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Out of Pokemon Go, the mobile game

3233
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Yeah, that does seem really appealing to me

3234
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Because they've taken out a lot of the grinding

3235
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Well, and this will be my first traditional

3236
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Pokemon game, because I only play Pokemon

3237
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Technically, I mean

3238
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
If we want to get technical, it is not part of the

3239
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Mainline series, it is a side game

3240
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
It's like a remake of the first

3241
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
But you know if this sells well

3242
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
We'll have Pokemon Let's Go

3243
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
You know

3244
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Espeon and Umbreon

3245
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
You know, stuff from the second generation

3246
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
So that'll be

3247
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Inevitable

3248
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Let's go Magikarp

3249
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I'm sure a lot of people will be into that

3250
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says

3251
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Meanwhile, Shane is buying both versions

3252
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Oh, I'm sure

3253
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
He has a man now, so I'm pretty sure

3254
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
He's buying one for him and one for his man

3255
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
And they can trade with each other

3256
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Probably buying the two consoles too

3257
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
At least one of them, I'm sure

3258
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I don't know, I'll text him in a little bit if y'all

3259
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Really want to know an update, but you can safely assume

3260
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
He's buying more than one copy

3261
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
I am only buying one copy

3262
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
I got Let's Go Pikachu

3263
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Because when I was kind of doing an informal

3264
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Assessment on my Twitter feed, it seemed like everybody

3265
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Was going Eevee

3266
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I don't know what the difference is aside from your starting Pokemon

3267
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Is there really a big difference?

3268
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Well, if it's like Red and Blue, there will be

3269
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Pokemon that you can't catch

3270
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
In one that you can in the other

3271
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Like, I don't remember what Pokemon

3272
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Didn't cross over

3273
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
I want to say like Ekans

3274
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
And, um

3275
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Arbok were exclusive to one

3276
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
And then like

3277
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Paras might have been in the other

3278
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I don't remember, but there are certain Pokemon

3279
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
That don't show up

3280
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
If it's like Red and Blue, which is my assumption

3281
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
But can I just take those from Pokemon Go

3282
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
And just transfer them into the game or something like that?

3283
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Well, you trade them, you trade them with friends

3284
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
That was the whole thing

3285
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
You had a friend with Pokemon Blue

3286
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
And then you could trade them into your game

3287
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Because either game had all the Pokemon in it

3288
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Just like now that they're up to like

3289
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Gen 7

3290
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
And probably why these games take a while to work on

3291
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Is that with the Pokemon Bank

3292
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
You can get Pokemon all the way back

3293
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
From the earliest gens

3294
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
And import them into

3295
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
The newest Pokemon Sun and Moon

3296
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
And I'm sure the Pokemon Bank

3297
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Will be supported by

3298
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
The Switch Pokemon, which will be Gen 8

3299
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Which will be the next mainline Pokemon game

3300
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Assumably as next holiday

3301
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
And this game is supposed to be like the holdover

3302
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
This is the tied you over title

3303
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Which is fine

3304
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I think it's a very interesting direction

3305
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I'm really hoping it's

3306
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Yeah, I'm really hoping it's going to be good

3307
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Some folks in chat reminding me

3308
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Sia Tabiri says Bellsprout was exclusive to Blue

3309
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Sia Tabiri says

3310
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I think Meowth was exclusive to Blue

3311
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Some other comments in chat

3312
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
S2100mat suggests

3313
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Let's go Bidoof

3314
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
No one can play that, are you kidding?

3315
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
I love Bidoof

3316
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I got more excited

3317
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
On community day when those bunnyries

3318
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Showed up, the little bunnies

3319
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
The bunnies

3320
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
When did they show up?

3321
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
At the mall, they were just randomly

3322
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Caught like three of them on just random pokestops

3323
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
And I was more excited about that

3324
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Yeah, I finally evolved one of those

3325
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
And I got a shiny

3326
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Whatever that thing was

3327
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
I don't know, I didn't really need it

3328
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I didn't get my

3329
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
My enlightened

3330
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Pokemon, though

3331
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
I got the stupid

3332
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Ponyta that was shiny

3333
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
But I didn't get a shiny Cubone

3334
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
And I was very disappointed

3335
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Because I have a horse named Smurf

3336
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I didn't get either one, sadly

3337
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
But you get the shirts

3338
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
If you look in the story

3339
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
You do the shirts, that's cool

3340
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Ponyta is shiny

3341
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I hate that that's a resistance thing

3342
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
It evolved it too

3343
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
It dulls out even

3344
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
I like the color better when it's a Ponyta

3345
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
It still looks cool though

3346
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
I still like it

3347
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Thank you Elliot, great email

3348
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Appreciate hearing from you, hope you're well

3349
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Next email from Dark Tetsuya

3350
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
We love hearing from Dark Tetsuya

3351
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
And Dark Tetsuya is giving us a game review tonight

3352
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Hey OLR, so a funny thing happened this week

3353
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Destructoid was giving away copies of a new

3354
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Download title for Nintendo Switch

3355
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
It's also on Steam

3356
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
As luck would have it, I was one of the winners

3357
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
So I got to try this game out

3358
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
So this game is from Flying Tiger and G-Mode

3359
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Who you might remember them from the Data East

3360
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Arcade line by Johnny Turbo

3361
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Who as an aside was based on a real person

3362
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
If you've ever read those weird comments they had

3363
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
For the TurboGrafx-16 CD

3364
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
That appeared in game magazines back in the day

3365
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
And came out on Switch and PC a couple weeks ago

3366
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
The game itself is an interesting concept

3367
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
They've taken some of the old graphics and sound

3368
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Assets from the classic arcade games

3369
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
And turned it into a team based

3370
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Competition twin stick shooter

3371
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Almost like Smash TV

3372
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
You and a friend playing as BurgerTime star Peter

3373
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Pepper compete in a two on two

3374
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Game to take on the bag of money

3375
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
And run it into your opponent's goal

3376
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
But you'll have to traverse several screens

3377
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Inspired by some of the Data East Arcade

3378
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Classics like Heavy Barrel, Bad Dudes

3379
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
And Karate Champ

3380
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Each with its own themed stage hazards

3381
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Like enemies and billiard balls

3382
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Although I have to say the single player challenges

3383
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Get insanely hard at times

3384
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
This is definitely more of a party game

3385
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
To get all your friends together and try to get to the goal

3386
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Before the other team does

3387
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
So I'd really only recommend this one if you have friends over

3388
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Or take your system to parties or something

3389
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
This is definitely more a multiplayer experience

3390
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Especially considering it's 20 bucks

3391
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
On Switch

3392
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Well thank you for the game review

3393
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
This was not a game on my radar

3394
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
But you know I'm a sucker for retro games

3395
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
And I love it when they take like retro stuff

3396
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
And make new things out of it

3397
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Like NES Remix right?

3398
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
I don't know what they're doing here

3399
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
It's kind of like a hodgepodge of the Data East games

3400
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
So that's cool

3401
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Yeah, fun

3402
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Alright, one more email for us tonight

3403
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
From Frodo Swagons

3404
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Who says, Frodo Swagons here

3405
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I haven't owned a ton of gaming consoles

3406
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
But when I think back at the ones

3407
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I have purchased or experienced

3408
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
When I think of a specific console

3409
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I always have a few favorite games

3410
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
That come straight to mind

3411
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Like my personal classics

3412
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I was wondering what are all of your favorite games

3413
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
When you name off your consoles

3414
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Minar for Nintendo 64

3415
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Cruisin USA, GoldenEye, Pokemon Snap

3416
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Ken Griffey Baseball, Mario 64

3417
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
PlayStation

3418
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Jet Moto, Kirby, Tomb Raider

3419
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Space Jam, Crash Bandicoot

3420
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
PC, Roller Coaster Tycoon

3421
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Carmageddon, Doom

3422
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Xbox, 007 Nightfire

3423
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
NASCAR 99, Unreal Championship

3424
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Test Drive, Fusion Frenzy

3425
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Outlaw Golf

3426
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
The games that you, not necessarily

3427
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
The best games on the system

3428
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Not necessarily the critical darlings

3429
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
But what are the games that you

3430
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Are always going to associate with a particular system?

3431
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Loki, you want to dive into that

3432
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Like Frodo Swagons said, thanks for the email

3433
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I don't know, that's a lot

3434
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
But with PC games, I wouldn't even think about it like that

3435
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I think about it as the different PCs I've owned

3436
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Because

3437
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
It's going to be different

3438
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
The PC is way too big

3439
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
I'd say one of my first PCs

3440
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
It would have to be Wolfenstein 3D

3441
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
What the hell are they playing on there?

3442
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I remember this original X-Men game

3443
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
That I really liked on my old, old PC

3444
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
The Sierra games

3445
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I think that was later though, because we had CD-Raw

3446
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
No, I had

3447
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
The Secret of Monkey Island

3448
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
And then of course

3449
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
What was something else?

3450
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Click and Play

3451
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
No, I didn't have Click and Play on that PC

3452
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Oh

3453
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Space Quest 4

3454
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Was another one they had on there

3455
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
And then of course

3456
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
More modern

3457
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
The PC after that

3458
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
The next one we got was probably

3459
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
ZZT

3460
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Fuck yeah, ZZT

3461
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Yeah, so ZZT, Click and Play

3462
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Scorched Earth, Red Alert

3463
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Would have been something I played

3464
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
A lot of on there

3465
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I'll take on some of the consoles

3466
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
So like for the NES

3467
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
The Guardian Legend, I'm always going to associate

3468
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
The Legend of Zelda, the original

3469
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
For sure

3470
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Mario Bros. 3, Mario Bros. 2

3471
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
So I stayed up all night playing both those games

3472
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
I remember renting Mario Bros. 2

3473
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
On New Year's Eve

3474
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Because the place would be closed on New Year's Day

3475
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
So you got an extra day for free

3476
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
So I remember getting in there and getting that Mario Bros. 2 copy that day

3477
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
And I actually have a lot of memories playing

3478
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Star Tropics as well

3479
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
If I had played that game again today, I wouldn't remember my way through it

3480
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Because I tried on the NES Classic

3481
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
And Metroid

3482
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Because with the Super Nintendo, obviously you know I'm going to say Super Metroid

3483
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
But I'd also say

3484
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Honestly, like some deeper cuts

3485
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Equinox was always a favorite game of mine on that system

3486
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Draken, just because that was the game I got

3487
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
As a launch title

3488
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
When my parents bought me the Super Nintendo

3489
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
They bought that game because the guy at Montgomery Ward

3490
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Recommended it to them

3491
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
That is a true story

3492
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
And then

3493
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
I'd also say with Super Nintendo

3494
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
I was on the tip of my tongue and I forgot

3495
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Final Fantasy 3

3496
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Which we all know is really 6

3497
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
But it was 3 when it came out

3498
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
PlayStation was during my college years

3499
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
So I missed out on a lot of it

3500
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
But for sure Final Fantasy 7

3501
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Because I played the shit out of that when it was released

3502
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Super Puzzle Fighter 2

3503
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I played a lot of that game

3504
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
And other puzzlers too

3505
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Like Intelligent Cube

3506
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Played a bit of that

3507
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Those are some games I would always associate with PlayStation

3508
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
And yeah, I think

3509
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I think I've said enough

3510
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Well, when it comes to the original PlayStation

3511
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I've got to, you know, talk about

3512
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
DDR

3513
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Yeah, oh for sure

3514
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
We had the mod chip, well, mod cart

3515
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I guess

3516
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Used to play all that stuff in there

3517
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Gosh, I don't know

3518
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
The Jungle Book Dancing Game

3519
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Because that was the gateway drug into

3520
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
The Jungle Book Dancing Game

3521
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Because that was the gateway drug into

3522
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
DDR, getting a dance mat in the US

3523
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Remember? Who knows? I didn't say they were good

3524
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
It's just games you associate

3525
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Alright, thank you for the email FrodoSwagons

3526
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
It's always fun to take a walk down memory lane

3527
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com

3528
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Sia Tabiri says for the NES

3529
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Mario 2, Mario 3, Dragon Spirit

3530
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Little Nemo, Dream Master

3531
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Dartitsia says for the PlayStation

3532
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Parappa the Rappa, that's a good one

3533
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Akuma JP says Einhander

3534
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
on my PlayStation

3535
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
So yeah, good answers you guys

3536
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Alright, and to follow up on the previous

3537
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
email, the question was asked

3538
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
How many copies of Pokemon Let's

3539
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Go did Shane get? So I texted

3540
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
him, and he texted me back

3541
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Here you go

3542
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
So far, one copy of both

3543
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Eevee and Pikachu, Pokeball

3544
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Plus bundles, so two

3545
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
And the Pikachu System

3546
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
bundle, so three, so far

3547
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Oh, and his boyfriend

3548
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
technically is getting the Eevee

3549
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Pokeball Plus bundle from me

3550
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
So four. We just pre-ordered

3551
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
four of the Pokeball chargers too

3552
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
So there you go

3553
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
He needs to offload some copies of the game

3554
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I'll take one of them because I haven't

3555
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
purchased one yet, and I mean, just saying

3556
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
You don't need multiple copies of the same game

3557
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
It's, it's, I

3558
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
You know what, like, y'all wanna give me shit

3559
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
for buying Mass Effect 3 multiple, or my fourth

3560
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
copy of Diablo 3 on Switch, but

3561
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I'm just saying, I'll take a copy of his

3562
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Pikachu one, but, um

3563
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
I'm just gonna go buy one, so I mean, might as well

3564
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
It sounds like SSJ100Matt

3565
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
won the bet in chat, I told you four

3566
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Dardisius says, yeah, you called it

3567
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
And AkumaJP says, damn, hardcore

3568
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
But, I mean, this is not, like

3569
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Shane loves Pokemon, he trades himself

3570
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
That's what he does. Whatever, you like

3571
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
something, I'm not gonna

3572
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
You spend your money however the hell you want

3573
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I like DDR, I bought a goddamn machine

3574
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
I have no room to talk

3575
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Hey man, you have no room to talk, that's fine

3576
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Alright, but there's the answer to the question

3577
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Alright, let's move on, we have some

3578
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to your calls

3579
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
at OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word

3580
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
on Skype, but first some news, Loki

3581
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
So you may remember there's some games that

3582
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Japan's been getting that run on the

3583
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Switch that may not necessarily run on the Switch

3584
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
over here, because, well, they're streaming

3585
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
games, and so

3586
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Capcom was one of those that kind of

3587
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
experimented with that, with Resident Evil 7

3588
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
the Switch version, of course, you may remember

3589
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Ubisoft did the same thing with

3590
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
the new Assassin's Creed game

3591
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
but apparently they've had some actual

3592
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
success with the

3593
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Switch version of Resident Evil 7

3594
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
to the point where they're actually considering

3595
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
on furthering

3596
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
or to do some more of that

3597
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
so, they're saying that, you know

3598
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
after the success

3599
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
of the

3600
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Resident Evil 7

3601
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
there was

3602
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
they did the fact that there was a

3603
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
significant impact

3604
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
you know, with the interest in that

3605
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
that they're gonna probably try some other games

3606
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
and while we did release this

3607
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
certain title, Supporting Cloud Gaming

3608
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
in the first half, this was done primarily

3609
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
for technology, or technological research

3610
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
purposes, and did not have a

3611
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
significant impact on earnings

3612
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
based on the results of the

3613
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
research, we internally considered

3614
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
future expansion to cloud gaming, so

3615
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
apparently

3616
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
that might be something we'll see a little bit more

3617
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
in Switch, and maybe even something that we'll see

3618
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
leave just Japan, and

3619
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
not, you know

3620
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
venture into other regions as well

3621
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
so, I'm curious

3622
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
to see

3623
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
where this kind of goes

3624
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
they're gonna get a return on their investment

3625
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
that's worthwhile

3626
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
I don't know, they don't really have any huge

3627
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
upcoming games, I think, that would really

3628
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
benefit from something like this, because right now

3629
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
the stuff that they've released over here

3630
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
recently, it's been like fighting games

3631
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
and stuff like that, that probably wouldn't be something you'd want to stream

3632
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
bonds006

3633
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
in chat sums this up, saying

3634
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
in other words, they made money

3635
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
so they will keep trying to make more money

3636
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
best wishes, Capcom

3637
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
AkumaJP says they are still testing the water

3638
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I mean, honestly guys

3639
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
this is also relevant

3640
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
because I could see a lot more

3641
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
games going down this path

3642
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
if you are able to successfully

3643
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
play games on the cloud and have the minimal

3644
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
you know

3645
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
delay, I mean you

3646
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
would never be able to play a music game in the cloud

3647
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
at least not with today's technology, but who knows 10 years from now

3648
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
but I really feel like when we get to

3649
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
the Playstation 5 and the next box

3650
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
we're gonna see a lot more of like

3651
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
shit that happens in the cloud, like you were talking about

3652
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
it's supposed to happen with Crackdown 3

3653
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
but for whatever reason they dialed that back it sounds like

3654
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
but I really do think

3655
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
that's gonna be a major part of the next round of

3656
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
consoles and how we're gonna get

3657
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
even more mind-blowing graphics that take

3658
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
forever to develop I'm sure

3659
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
so, anyhow

3660
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
moving on, if you

3661
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
and then there's Nintendo Switch

3662
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
talk about

3663
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
the technological pushing the envelope

3664
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
but then again, you know what

3665
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
this is how the Nintendo Switch hangs in there

3666
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
and this whole story was just about

3667
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
putting some of these more technologically demanding games on the Switch

3668
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
but the Switch finally got

3669
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
something that people were wondering, when is this gonna happen

3670
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
so if you were waiting for YouTube

3671
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
on the Nintendo Switch, guess what

3672
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
it finally frickin' happened this week

3673
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
they used all that YouTube money that they siphoned

3674
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
from people putting

3675
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Nintendo games on YouTube

3676
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
so anyway

3677
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
YouTube is available around the world

3678
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
it's on the UK store, North America store

3679
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
I don't know about Japan, but I don't see why it wouldn't be

3680
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
and of course

3681
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
it's YouTube, and it's pretty much

3682
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
the same interface and everything you're used to

3683
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
on other platforms, but

3684
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
now you can take it, essentially on the go

3685
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
as long as there's internet

3686
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
obviously it's still there, where you can't like download videos to watch later

3687
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
that would be it

3688
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
well, I mean, YouTube Red kinda lets you do that

3689
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
right, but I don't think it does it on the Switch

3690
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
I don't know, I haven't, I mean, who do I know that has

3691
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
YouTube Red? All-Source has that. So many videos on my

3692
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
32 gigabytes of internal storage

3693
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
so

3694
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
anyway, the YouTube app is

3695
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
now out, by the way

3696
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
and besides, you know, it's fine if you can't

3697
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
necessarily download

3698
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
videos to the Switch

3699
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
because, what, you don't have a cell

3700
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
phone or something?

3701
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Don't y'all have phones? Don't y'all have phones?

3702
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Anyway

3703
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
that's what Nintendo's saying about voice chat

3704
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
don't y'all have phones? But Nintendo

3705
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
is also, on kind of a related note

3706
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
looking to continue to add features to

3707
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Switch online

3708
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
a recent investor Q&A, Shontaro Furukawa

3709
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
said

3710
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
we think Nintendo Switch online had a good launch

3711
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
but the service has only just begun

3712
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
so we have no plans to disclose any current subscriber

3713
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
ratios or number of subscribers at this time

3714
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
that's kinda interesting

3715
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
well, that sounds like it's not very high

3716
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
then

3717
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
I don't necessarily know if I would read into that

3718
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
it may be

3719
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
well, yes it would be, because if it was high

3720
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
it may be lower than expectations

3721
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
but I don't think that necessarily means

3722
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
it's a flop

3723
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
well, I don't think it's a flop, but like

3724
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
I can tell you right now, I'm not like

3725
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
woooo, Nintendo games

3726
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
anyway, continuing in the

3727
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
statement, Shontaro Furukawa said

3728
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
as for the kind of service this will

3729
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
develop into in the future, Nintendo Switch

3730
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Online is essentially a digital service

3731
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
but we are also offering controllers specifically

3732
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
for use with Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo

3733
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Switch Online, exclusively to subscribers

3734
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
of the service. We see the need to develop

3735
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
the service beyond being merely

3736
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
digital, in ways to play our

3737
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
strengths as a company that operates

3738
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
an integrated hardware and software

3739
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
business, so I'm really surprised

3740
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
that some of these new amiibo weren't

3741
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
tied to this, but

3742
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
so far they're not

3743
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
it would be a hell of a way to get the ami-

3744
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
do you know, so I found

3745
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
out that

3746
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Dark Souls came out on Nintendo Switch

3747
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
right? Now, Alan

3748
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
loves Dark Souls, like he plays

3749
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
a lot, he just got the fucking

3750
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
achievement for getting all the other achievements in Dark Souls

3751
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
that is not something you do overnight, right?

3752
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
So, he plays a lot of Dark Souls

3753
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
and I was like, do you want me to buy Dark Souls

3754
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
for you on Switch? And kind of knowing he

3755
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
probably would never play it, he was like, nah

3756
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
I don't really want it on Switch cause he's not

3757
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
gonna play it compared to keyboard and mouse, he's like

3758
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
but, I'd really like to get that Solari

3759
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
amiibo. I was like, okay

3760
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
alright, sure, cute little collectible

3761
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
couldn't find it anywhere

3762
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
come to find out that whole thing was a GameStop

3763
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
exclusive, I forgot that Solari amiibo is a GameStop

3764
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
exclusive, he goes into a GameStop

3765
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
to try to find it while we were at the mall anyway

3766
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
hunting Pokemon this weekend and they tell him

3767
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
the guy, the clerk who works there

3768
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
said he had never even seen one in person

3769
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
because I guess they sold out instantly

3770
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
when the pre-orders went up in March

3771
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
and he actually told Alan

3772
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
the best way to get those right now would be

3773
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
on the reseller market

3774
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
and I'm like, fuck resellers

3775
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
period. Oh my god, does Nintendo not

3776
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
understand supply chain?

3777
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Oh yes, Nintendo doesn't understand supply

3778
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
chain, quotey fingers, I mean

3779
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
cause

3780
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
I am so

3781
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
sick of this, like

3782
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
oh my god, we're just getting into

3783
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
the physical, you know,

3784
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
collectible market, we don't know what the fuck

3785
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
we're doing, ahhh

3786
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I'm sorry, like, how

3787
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
how often are we gonna use this

3788
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
as an excuse, well we had no idea

3789
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
what the demand would be

3790
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
do you really have no analysts that fucking

3791
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
do projections for you that you

3792
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
didn't figure this shit out? I mean, I'm sorry

3793
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
that's just really, terrible

3794
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
excuse, like, this many years into it

3795
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
where it's like this all the fucking

3796
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
time

3797
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Anyway, if anyone out there has a lead

3798
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
on how I could get one of these, not through

3799
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
a reseller market cause I'm not paying markup

3800
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
I would super deeply appreciate it

3801
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
but I'm not gonna expect anything, but you can always hit me up

3802
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
on Twitter at MrRobRoberts, but it would make my hubby

3803
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
very happy if we could locate one

3804
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
cause now it's a thing

3805
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Alright, let's move on, a few more stories

3806
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
before we get to the Skypline, Loki

3807
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Alright, so

3808
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
apparently there is this leak that's

3809
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
come out where Valve is developing

3810
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
a new VR

3811
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
headset

3812
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
so they've got images of like this prototype

3813
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Valve headset and there's a Valve

3814
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
like, watermark on this

3815
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
looks like circuit board here

3816
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
they're saying that

3817
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
apparently from the sources

3818
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
that we're talking about, it's like

3819
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
gonna have a 135 degree

3820
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
view with a Vive Pro

3821
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
resolution and

3822
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
it's gonna be combined with, or possibly

3823
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
combined with these Knuckles controllers

3824
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
that they have and they're saying as well as

3825
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
a Half-Life based VR game

3826
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
that's gonna be a prequel

3827
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
rather than a sequel

3828
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
possibly

3829
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
but there are like apparently

3830
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
screenshots

3831
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
here of this and they're saying that something looks like

3832
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
they have a spot almost where a leap sensor

3833
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
could fit

3834
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
interesting though

3835
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
no word on any sort of

3836
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
details on when something like this would be released

3837
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
but it is something that they're working on

3838
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
so I guess I'll have to wait and see

3839
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
you don't have

3840
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
HTC Vive right? I don't, no

3841
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
would you consider picking this up or HTC Vive

3842
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
or any of that? If it was affordable

3843
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
and

3844
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
really that's it, if it's affordable cause

3845
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
like right now that's what's stopping me from

3846
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
purchasing yet another VR headset

3847
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
I just don't play enough VR stuff

3848
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
I do want one for PC because there's a lot

3849
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
more out there on the PC

3850
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
side but

3851
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
I don't know

3852
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
I'm still fine with just the

3853
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
PlayStation VR for now

3854
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
alright well

3855
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
in other news related

3856
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
to our little quip about don't you all have

3857
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
phones which I feel like that line's gonna get said

3858
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
once a week on this show for a very long time

3859
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
but some interesting follow up

3860
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
rumors, heavy heavy rumors about

3861
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
what was to be at Blizzcon

3862
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
of course that story showed up that said

3863
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
that Diablo 4 was

3864
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
a planned announcement and it was

3865
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
yanked at the last minute

3866
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
that was a rumor that Kotaku posted

3867
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
but then they ended up updating it

3868
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
to basically say the article

3869
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
that originally stated that Blizzard recorded

3870
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
a video and that co-founder

3871
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Alan Adam was going to talk about a new Diablo

3872
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
game. Kotaku

3873
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
is still sticking by that that video

3874
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
was made but Blizzard is officially

3875
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
disputing that it was ever planned for

3876
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Blizzcon in a statement

3877
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
to Kotaku Blizzard said first off

3878
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
we want to mention that we definitely hear our community

3879
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
we generally don't comment on rumors or

3880
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
speculation but we can say that we didn't pull

3881
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
any announcements from Blizzcon this year or

3882
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
have plans for other announcements we do

3883
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
continue to have different teams working on

3884
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
multiple unannounced Diablo projects

3885
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
and we look forward to announcing when the time

3886
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
is right but Kotaku is doubling

3887
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
down basically saying two people

3888
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
familiar with Blizzard's plans confirmed

3889
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
that the company recorded a video

3890
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
where co-founder Alan Adam said

3891
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
spoke to fans about a new Diablo

3892
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
project so basically

3893
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
what's being disputed is what

3894
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
is it for?

3895
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Perhaps it's an

3896
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
announcement for the game awards which

3897
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
would seem ridiculous to me to not

3898
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
play that at Blizzcon

3899
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
like if it turns out

3900
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
that they're going to announce it at the game awards

3901
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
and they passed Blizzcon to do that

3902
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
that's whoo oh

3903
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
the Blizzard fans are not

3904
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
going to be happy. Well on top of that too

3905
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
I did see something

3906
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
that was a press event or something

3907
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
like shortly after all the announcements

3908
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
and they were talking about

3909
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
that their development teams

3910
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
that are working on Diablo

3911
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
that a lot of them

3912
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
or even some of their top developers

3913
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
from all the different

3914
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
franchises that they have are working on

3915
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
mobile projects so that

3916
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
pissed people off as well because they're like

3917
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
well wait a second you're taking your top people

3918
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
from all these other things to

3919
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
develop mobile games

3920
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
what the fuck you guys

3921
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
so that's just

3922
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
kind of a little bit more salt

3923
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
in the wounds I guess

3924
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Well

3925
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
what do you think? Do you think

3926
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
it's possible that they were going

3927
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
to announce it and then they pulled it?

3928
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I'm like why would you pull that?

3929
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
I guess there's concern about

3930
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
oh it's the game's been

3931
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
going in these different directions and

3932
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
it's kind of you know it's hitting that

3933
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
phase a lot of games do where they're not totally

3934
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
sure like what the final product is going to look like but I'm like

3935
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
you could still just announce

3936
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
you're doing it like it's everything I said in

3937
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
last week's show if they had just followed up

3938
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
that announcement just like

3939
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Bethesda did with a 30 second trailer

3940
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
that shows the Diablo 4 logo

3941
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
it doesn't even have to be the final logo

3942
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
just one that they could then

3943
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
sell on t-shirts and people would buy it. It's too late

3944
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
though. It's too late now

3945
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
but I mean I just

3946
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
I feel like video game PR people

3947
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
are going to study this fuck up for years

3948
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
They'll remember it

3949
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
for sure

3950
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Anyway moving on

3951
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
a couple more stories before the

3952
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Skype line just two more Loki

3953
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Alright and so apparently

3954
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
there's

3955
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
with you guys may remember

3956
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Smash Brothers so with

3957
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Mr. Game and Watch

3958
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
they had some different attacks that were

3959
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
in there one of which unfortunately

3960
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
is mildly racist apparently

3961
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
so it's the attack where

3962
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
he kind of

3963
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
looks like a Native American

3964
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
or whatever and he

3965
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
throws fire so apparently

3966
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
this fire attack which is

3967
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
from well the game fire attack

3968
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
might be a little bit offensive

3969
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
nowadays so they're going to be

3970
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
retooling that and changing

3971
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
it because it doesn't necessarily

3972
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
represent the company's values

3973
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
nowadays

3974
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
so they're going to have to I guess

3975
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
redesign how that's going to look

3976
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
and it will be in effect

3977
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
I guess in the new Smash

3978
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Brothers game so they say

3979
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
yeah Nintendo's been planning to distribute an

3980
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
update for Smash Brothers Ultimate

3981
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
that removes the feature or the

3982
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
feather from the silhouette of Mr. Game

3983
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
and Watch

3984
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
the original game on

3985
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
which is this depiction of the character's base

3986
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
was released more than three decades ago and doesn't

3987
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
represent our company's values today

3988
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
we apologize if you were offended

3989
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
alright

3990
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
well I suppose that's nice

3991
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
of a company to listen to the feedback and

3992
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
correct their course yeah

3993
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
that's just a minor thing alright

3994
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
before we go to the phones

3995
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
I do want to point out another heavy

3996
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
rumor but I think this is more

3997
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
than rumor because it was discovered in a Steam

3998
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
database that

3999
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Sunset Overdrive is on its way

4000
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
to the PC this

4001
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
after an ESRB listing was already

4002
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
released now I bet this is the type of thing

4003
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
that could show up at Game Awards because if

4004
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
they didn't announce it at X018

4005
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
which would have been the perfect place to do it

4006
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
well I guess not, not for PC

4007
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
I would think that Game Awards is like a shoe-in

4008
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
they're going to come out in Game Awards and say this is Sunset

4009
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Overdrive is available today

4010
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
on PC I would bet that's going to be

4011
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
what happens we'll see but anyway

4012
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
a lot of people that did play this game really

4013
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
enjoy it, it kind of went under the radar

4014
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
for a lot of people I think just because the Xbox One

4015
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
didn't end up as highly adopted

4016
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
I'm surprised it's becoming the Steam and not like

4017
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
the Windows Store I guess

4018
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Microsoft probably just wants to put it everywhere

4019
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
but then again wasn't

4020
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
their other game that was

4021
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
I can't remember what the hell that game was called

4022
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
but like the other

4023
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Xbox One game that

4024
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
was a Kinect game but not a Kinect game

4025
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
anymore I can't remember

4026
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
what the fuck it was called but

4027
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Kinect developed it but

4028
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I don't know I think that

4029
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
well but then Forza is not available on Steam

4030
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
well then the other one too also

4031
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Dead Rising, didn't Dead Rising

4032
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
end up coming out? I believe it did you're right

4033
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
yeah so

4034
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
but yeah so anyway looks like Sunset Overdrive

4035
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
is going to be happening it's just a matter

4036
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
of when and honestly

4037
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Microsoft is releasing most things on

4038
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
PC and Xbox anyway

4039
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Crackdown 3 has got to be a PC game as well right?

4040
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
yeah it's going to be on the Windows Store

4041
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
honestly I might just pick it up on PC well I guess

4042
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
I might as well get the one that's universal right? You buy it

4043
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
digitally you get the universal thing right? I imagine that's still

4044
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
going to be the case just like it was for Forza

4045
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
yeah I think so I'll probably pick that up that's pretty cool

4046
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
so cool Sunset Overdrive

4047
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
probably on its way to PC

4048
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I wonder how that's going to work though if I already own it on

4049
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Xbox One thanks to games with gold

4050
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
I would already own it digitally so are they going to

4051
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
give me the PC one for free? They might if they

4052
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
make it a play anywhere type thing

4053
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
that would actually be I would be like so happy

4054
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
I mean I guess Steam wouldn't really be involved

4055
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
in that case but still hey free game

4056
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
so alright

4057
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
let's go to the phones you can

4058
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000

02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
almost every week well

4092
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
I try I try so

4093
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
you know coming out of the end of the con

4094
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
season and so forth you know well we appreciate

4095
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
it so what's on your mind tonight buddy

4096
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Sunset Orange Drive is

4097
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
is one again that's one of those games

4098
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
how did I miss it

4099
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
I picked it up for 10 bucks and

4100
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
I'm having a fucking blast with

4101
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
that game I think there's a lot of people that really

4102
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
slept on the game and to be honest I haven't played

4103
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
it a lot and it's one of those titles I really need

4104
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
to go back and play more but especially

4105
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
if it does end up being play anywhere on

4106
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
PC I think I probably yeah

4107
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
I'd like super check it out why not

4108
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
I mean they gave that game away

4109
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
so I think a lot of people have it

4110
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
yeah definitely and

4111
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
another thing I

4112
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
quit like the tail end of

4113
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
XO 18 like the summary

4114
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
and I have to say

4115
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Microsoft kind of got me shook

4116
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
why is that what what what

4117
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
shook you at XO 18

4118
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
the studio purchases or what

4119
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
no Final Fantasy backwards

4120
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
compatibility

4121
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
that I mean I'm excited for

4122
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
people that owned it on Xbox but I

4123
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
had them on PlayStation so unfortunately

4124
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
it does me no good and I just

4125
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I don't see myself buying those

4126
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
games on Xbox one when

4127
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
I already did buy Final Fantasy 13

4128
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
on PC and

4129
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
you might remember it was a little bit bumpy when it first

4130
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
came out on PC it had like some

4131
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
graphic things holding it back but they they tweaked

4132
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
it and they release you know they they like updated

4133
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
it via patch and it's it's pretty

4134
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
solid like the PC release is pretty good

4135
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
so I feel like if

4136
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
they up rezzed or

4137
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
did anything special to Final Fantasy

4138
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
they probably just kind of ported the PC version

4139
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
to Xbox one which is not a bad

4140
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
thing it's it's great it looked great on

4141
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
PC I don't know I think they went

4142
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
back and worked on the 360 version

4143
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
and made it a little bit better I mean

4144
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
yes I have all three

4145
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
games for PlayStation 3 but

4146
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I think about

4147
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
almost a year ago I had my

4148
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
system reflowed

4149
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
and now when I turn on my PS3

4150
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
it sounds like a jet engine

4151
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
and I'm looking at the prices of

4152
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
FF 13 on

4153
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
360 and it's like I could pick up all

4154
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
three games for 25 bucks

4155
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
which is like probably cheaper

4156
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
than what it's going to be you know

4157
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
in the in the Microsoft store you know

4158
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
for Xbox one that's

4159
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
that's not bad yeah I

4160
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
I do think there was a missed opportunity here to

4161
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
like repackage and release a trilogy

4162
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
but that's

4163
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
you see you got that on the second hand market

4164
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
for 25 bucks yeah on

4165
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Amazon that's

4166
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
really not a bad idea that may that

4167
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
may be a way to do it like to pick up the games

4168
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
on the second hand market and then play them that way

4169
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
is actually like a really smart idea kudos

4170
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
on that that's what I've been doing a lot

4171
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
of the games and I notice you know

4172
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
yes GameStop may have

4173
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
it for 19 bucks used

4174
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
but I can just go right over to Amazon

4175
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
pick it up for the same price brand spanking new

4176
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
in the case everything so

4177
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
yeah and now that you got

4178
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
the other Final Fantasy games coming

4179
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
over I'm just kind of hyped about

4180
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
it and you know I get

4181
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
it that the Final Fantasy

4182
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
games are supposed to be like defunct

4183
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
to Playstation I get that

4184
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
right but it's like I said

4185
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
the only reason why I

4186
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
picked up a 360

4187
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
I mean Xbox one is for the

4188
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
backwards compatibility and

4189
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
half of my 360 games play

4190
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
on the one hell when I thought

4191
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
about Crackdown I popped that in last night

4192
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
and I'm up for like two hours playing through that

4193
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
game I'm just like this looks

4194
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
amazing well and now

4195
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
even if you didn't have Crackdown we just

4196
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
mentioned earlier they're giving it away

4197
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
so you can get Crackdown so

4198
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
there's no reason not to check

4199
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
it out which of course is all just promo

4200
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
for Crackdown

4201
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
3 which is very similar

4202
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
to and again a reminder this is kind

4203
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
of your last chance cause it's only gonna be up for

4204
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
another week but Destiny 2

4205
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
is free on PC

4206
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
if you have the battle net launcher which if

4207
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
you've ever played Hearthstone or

4208
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
some of the free games that

4209
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Blizzard has then you have the

4210
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
battle net launcher you can get free Destiny 2

4211
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
but we all know it's because

4212
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
they have an expansion they're trying to sell so

4213
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
that's the thing you're gonna have to buy

4214
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
but hey it's still a free game

4215
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
I mean yeah I dumped on that too so

4216
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
yeah

4217
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
so well free stuff is good

4218
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
and backwards compatibility

4219
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
is great and I really

4220
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
wish it was a message that Sony would hear

4221
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
but for whatever reason they're not

4222
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
I mean

4223
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
look we had backwards compatibility

4224
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
for the Playstation 2 to the 1

4225
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
we had a PS3 for 1

4226
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
and 2 until they ripped

4227
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
that out and put it in the slip

4228
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
now they can't

4229
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
say it cannot be done

4230
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
because the

4231
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Xbox One and

4232
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
the Playstation 4 are the

4233
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
same identical

4234
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
hardware

4235
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
the speeds of the processors are slightly different

4236
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
the software that runs it is different

4237
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
but it can't be done

4238
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
I mean if Microsoft can do it

4239
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
it's no excuse

4240
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Sony can't, Microsoft's like oh we got this

4241
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
it's backwards compatible we have it in the store

4242
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
for $19.99 wait you have

4243
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
the game pop it in yours now

4244
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
for free we already know if

4245
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
nothing else that machine is perfectly capable

4246
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
of doing PS1 and PS2 games

4247
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
if nothing else we know

4248
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
the Playstation 4 can do that so

4249
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
it's just weird to me that they don't

4250
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
open it up so and I see in chat

4251
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Kaijuto says I don't ever want Sony

4252
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
to go back well I'm not like

4253
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
I honestly feel at this

4254
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
point it's like a switch it's a button

4255
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
that Sony won't push

4256
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
you know and if you don't want to play retro

4257
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
stuff fine don't again it's your money

4258
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
spend it on what you want but for those of us

4259
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
that would love to play Magic Penjel again

4260
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
on Playstation 4

4261
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
let us do it

4262
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
I mean I understand there are

4263
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
some people out there that are console

4264
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
collectors they have the space for it

4265
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
if you saw my entertainment center

4266
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
I'm running out of space

4267
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
I'm picking up the PS4 on Black Friday

4268
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
and I'm looking

4269
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
well there I'm going to take the PS2 out

4270
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
and put the PS4 there

4271
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
like you said I'd be happy with the PS1

4272
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
emulation on the PS4

4273
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
I can retire my PS3 fat

4274
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
that sounds like a NASA jet rocket

4275
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
and put a slim in there and call

4276
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
it a day

4277
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
well we'll see if

4278
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
this gamble pays off for Sony

4279
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
by the time the Playstation 5 rolls around

4280
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
because I bet you I just

4281
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
it's so interesting because

4282
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
I just remember when it was

4283
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Playstation 3 versus Xbox 360

4284
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
and Microsoft clobbered

4285
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Sony out the gate anyway

4286
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
and Sony spent a long time catching up

4287
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
and the tables got reversed

4288
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
this last time and Sony clobbered

4289
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Microsoft out the gate

4290
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
you know Microsoft is catching up to an extent

4291
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
but Sony's got the lead

4292
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
I'm almost wondering if

4293
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
it's going to flip again

4294
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
and coming out with the next series

4295
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
because Microsoft's got all these studios

4296
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
and will likely open itself up

4297
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
to backwards compatibility and pretty much has already

4298
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
said that no matter what they do

4299
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
with the Xbox in the future it's still going to play

4300
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
the older games or whatever

4301
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
so it would be interesting to see if Sony's going to

4302
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
follow suit or if they're going to stay stubborn like this

4303
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
and if that decision comes back

4304
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
to bite them

4305
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
you know you said it back

4306
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
a few episodes back

4307
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
as long as Sony's on top

4308
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
they're not going to care

4309
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
when Microsoft was on top they're not going to care

4310
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
and then the role was reversed

4311
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
so why hasn't either company learned yet

4312
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
that maybe you should care when you're on top

4313
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
because you're not going to be on top forever

4314
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
well I think Microsoft is starting to learn

4315
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
like when they had their

4316
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Windows phones

4317
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
their Windows phones are great

4318
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
on a business level

4319
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
but not on a personal

4320
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
the hardware is there

4321
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
the apps are not

4322
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
the fact that Square Enix

4323
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
says the Final Fantasy games are coming to Xbox One

4324
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
that means

4325
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Microsoft is starting to realize

4326
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
you need to not just

4327
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
throw money to buy studios

4328
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
you need to throw money at the third party to be like

4329
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
here's X amount of money

4330
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
we want these titles on our system

4331
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
I mean that's basically what Sony is doing

4332
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
I mean look at the gaming

4333
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
tournaments for fighting games

4334
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
mostly everyone's playing on PS4

4335
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
for the fighting games

4336
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
next year is going to be a hell of a year

4337
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
because I anticipate

4338
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Microsoft is going to be first out the gate

4339
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
next year so it's going to be very

4340
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
interesting to see what happens

4341
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
alright my friend I'm going to let you go

4342
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
to try and squeeze in some more calls but thank you as always

4343
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
for the call

4344
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
take care buddy

4345
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
OrangeLawnTradio all went over it on Skype

4346
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
and I had cut off a last minute story you wanted

4347
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
to do Loki while we wait for calls

4348
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
there's this game called Scum which apparently

4349
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
had a patch issued

4350
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
for it that fixed

4351
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
a bunch of bugs in the games

4352
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
all related to penis size

4353
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
because I like this game like Conan

4354
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
or Age of Conan I believe

4355
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
you create your character and the penis

4356
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
size and there's an issue where

4357
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
the penis size would get bigger

4358
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
each time you logged in

4359
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
and there's also one that says

4360
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
it's possible to increase penis size without it

4361
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
affecting other attributes and

4362
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
urinating would lock hands if the penis

4363
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
and penis if

4364
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
interrupted

4365
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
penises are very complicated

4366
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
things apparently

4367
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
in video games

4368
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
alrighty

4369
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
then

4370
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
DarkTit Studio in chat says

4371
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
this isn't a SoulCalibur 6 situation is it

4372
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
also wow speaking of SoulCalibur 6

4373
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
oh no I think we did touch on it last week

4374
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
the Nier character coming to SoulCalibur 6 I guess that wasn't

4375
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
rapid fire last week I think

4376
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
I think we mentioned it yeah

4377
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
I need to still pick up SoulCalibur 6

4378
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
I still have not picked that up

4379
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
and I really want to play it but

4380
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
it's that time of year where everything's coming out

4381
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
now we got Let's Go and

4382
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
all this other stuff

4383
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
one more call for calls Orange Lounge Radio all one word

4384
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
on Skype

4385
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
and by the way I just want you guys to know

4386
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
that I'm extremely

4387
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
happy because it sounds like somebody's coming through

4388
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
on the Amiibo that I need

4389
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
so I'm like super jazzed about that

4390
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
you don't even know so

4391
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
you guys are awesome this is what motivates me to keep

4392
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
coming back every week to do this show

4393
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
for serious how awesome you guys are

4394
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
um

4395
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
did you do

4396
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
no other stories no

4397
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
I did see someone talking about

4398
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
since you know obviously we have

4399
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
a very good version of Tetris

4400
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
on the Playstation 4

4401
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
that there was a not so

4402
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
good version of Tetris Ubisoft

4403
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
made about a year ago

4404
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
on the Playstation 4 I think

4405
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
I think I actually own that one too

4406
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
I think you do own it

4407
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
I don't remember what the

4408
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
I feel like it had frame rate issues or something

4409
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
like really basic that shouldn't have been there so

4410
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
uh it's always interesting to see

4411
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
like who gets the Tetris license and what they do with it

4412
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
because I feel like the Tetris company really

4413
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
licenses that out to like multiple people

4414
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
at once like pretty much whoever wants

4415
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
to do it so but I'm

4416
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
they might as well just delist

4417
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
the whatever Ubisoft made last year well

4418
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
I shouldn't be such an ass

4419
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
because it had the

4420
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
multiplayer stuff a little more embedded in it

4421
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
and Tetris Effect doesn't have multiplayer

4422
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
but you know it does have multiplayer

4423
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Puyo Puyo vs Tetris has a decent

4424
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
multiplayer in it and it has Puyo Puyo

4425
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
so you know

4426
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
I still think they'll inevitably

4427
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
do a Tetris Effect 2 I mean I really

4428
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
hope they do I

4429
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
just as long as

4430
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Tetsuya Mizuguchi gets to keep making games

4431
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
I think they just do DLC

4432
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
maybe

4433
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
I mean I would love to see them just do more skins

4434
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
and songs maybe some commercial

4435
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
stuff as DLC

4436
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
yeah well remember

4437
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
when Luminous on 360 I know I brought this up before

4438
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
remember when we went to that E3 and they were

4439
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
showing Luminous on 360 with like

4440
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
MTV type songs as skins

4441
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
and I've I this never

4442
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
came out but I played Madonna's

4443
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Sorry that song in that music

4444
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
video was a Luminous skin that they never

4445
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
released for whatever reason I don't know if the licensing

4446
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
fell through or what but that was something I played

4447
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
at E3 and I was super excited about it I remember

4448
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
not being able to really hear it on the show floor

4449
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
but it had the video of Madonna dancing

4450
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
and the only stuff

4451
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
we ever really got was all like the in-house

4452
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
like Genki Rockets and all that stuff

4453
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
they never did like

4454
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
actual songs

4455
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
probably thought they couldn't get the return on investment

4456
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
maybe I don't know but Luminous 2

4457
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
on PSP which people

4458
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
don't talk about as much as the original

4459
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Luminous 2 had a lot of commercial

4460
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
stuff in it it had like Hollaback Girl

4461
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
it had a Missy Elliott song it had Beck

4462
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
it had like a lot of commercial stuff in it

4463
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
I still don't remember that now

4464
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
I don't know why people didn't like that version

4465
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
of the game as much I thought it was great

4466
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
but anyway

4467
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
alright well sadly that's

4468
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
looks like the well is pretty dry on phone

4469
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
calls but that's okay you guys did great on

4470
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
emails tonight if you do think of anything

4471
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
you would like to email us about

4472
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000

RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars 4

4476
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
so I'll have plenty to talk about

4477
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
alright

4478
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
anyway that's about going to do it

4479
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
for another episode of Orange Laundrio

4480
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
I want to thank you guys for listening to our show

4484
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
and help us spread the word because we are the show where every

4485
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
gamer has a voice but only if the

4486
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
voices are here to air them

4487
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
so please a nice 5 star

4488
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
review on a place like iTunes or

4489
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Google Play podcast or wherever it is you

4490
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
heard about this those go

4491
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
a long way as well I am aware

4492
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
that you can get more podcasts on Spotify

4493
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
that is a direction I will go with

4494
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
OLR soon but behind the scenes

4495
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
we're going to be moving our hosting around

4496
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
the same time that we move to Twitch

4497
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
so for that reason I've held off on Spotify

4498
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
submission but I know that's something on people's radar

4499
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
and I will get us there

4500
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
soon so but

4501
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
otherwise we're in a lot of podcasting places

4502
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
as it is

4503
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
I think that's all I have to say

4504
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
so I think we can go around and get final thoughts

4505
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Loki your final thought tonight

4506
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
my final thought is I have

4507
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
a hell of a migraine and I'm not sure if it's

4508
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
because I spent the whole day with the kids or because

4509
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
of the smoke or a little bit of both

4510
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
a little bit of column A a little bit of column B

4511
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
for sure for sure and I guess on

4512
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
that note my final thought is

4513
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
I just I

4514
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
hope people are okay after the

4515
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
fires I hope they're able to build stuff back

4516
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
it's just it's so horrible

4517
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
reading about all that and knowing that I've been to a

4518
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
town that doesn't exist anymore it's really weird

4519
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
but my thoughts are with everybody

4520
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000

4521
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000

4522
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000

4523
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
