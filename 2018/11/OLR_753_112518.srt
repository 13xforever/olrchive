00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,440
This week, Sony made waves by announcing its retreat from events, but speculation is

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,760
that they're saving money, time, and effort in a quieter year.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,360
They'll be back, it's only inevitable.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,200
That's just one story to catch up on, join us for plenty more news from around the gaming

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,960
universe starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,520
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,800
every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,040
It's Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight, episode number 753 for this November the 25th of 2018.

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,360
My name, Rob Roberts, and his name, Techmaster Loki.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,360
Hello.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,360
Hi, how are you?

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
I'm fine.

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
We are back after a week off.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,840
We weren't here last week, and that was my bad.

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,480
I'll get to that in a minute.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,640
Not joining us in studio tonight, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,120
She is still on work leave.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,480
Unfortunately for a little while longer, but she'll be joining us live in studio December

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,960
9th, I think is the day she'll be here, which may be on the current trajectory I'm planning.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,040
I think December 9th is going to be our last shoutcast show.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,600
If you haven't already heard the news, our live show is going to move over to Twitch.

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,260
Nothing will change with the podcast.

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,960
It will still be a podcast feed as it always was.

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,180
In fact, I was reminded while we were doing our call with Bobby tonight earlier, we've

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,240
kind of done this before.

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,320
We used to be on Justin TV back in the day, and apparently somebody in our chat room over

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,500
at live.vognetwork.com dug up some old highlights.

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,420
So if you want to see like 2008 video clips of OLR, our old Twitch TV channel, Orange

29
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,420
Lounge Radio.

30
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,420
We didn't have a camera though.

31
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,420
No, we did.

32
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,420
Did we?

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,420
Oh yeah.

34
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,420
You forgot.

35
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,420
Yeah.

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,800
Remember the house I used to live at with John, with the lights, the Christmas lights

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
in the garage?

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
That was on video.

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,640
Remember you played the Final Fantasy 13 demo?

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,720
Yeah, but I thought we had that, just that was the video.

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,260
No, there was both.

42
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,660
Because remember I had that camera, that blue tiny little camera?

43
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,660
Yeah.

44
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,660
That thing broke by the way.

45
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,660
That's long gone.

46
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,520
That's when I was doing those vlogs on YouTube for a little while.

47
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,280
That's another project that's long gone.

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,340
So anyway, yeah.

49
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,500
So it's funny.

50
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,340
What's old is new again, but we're going back to the Twitch thing in a few weeks.

51
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,600
So we're targeting December 16th, but don't hold us to that.

52
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,300
But anyway, yeah.

53
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,000
So we're here in studio now doing the podcast the way we always have.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,160
And by the way, I do want to emphasize, it's still going to be Orange Lounge Radio even

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
after we move.

56
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,920
It's just going to be, yes, there will be some, you'll get to see us doing a radio show,

57
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
but it is still a radio show.

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,600
So I don't want our people that listen to us on their commutes.

59
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,240
And I know we have data entry during the day, people and other tech jobs where they just

60
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,440
listen to us in the earbuds while they play, or while they play, while they work, maybe

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,120
play, and do that.

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,300
And I just, for you guys, it's not going to change, but it is kind of a big change for

63
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,020
us and an exciting one as well.

64
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,300
But honestly, I've joked time and time again, this computer that we do the show on is still

65
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,220
running Windows XP.

66
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,380
So this technology is circa like 2006, 2007, and it's just, it's time to modernize a little

67
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,380
bit.

68
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,980
So it's going to be really exciting and hopefully get us some new folks here at Orange Lounge

69
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,980
Radio.

70
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,980
Really excited.

71
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,220
So let's talk about video games.

72
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,160
We are going to get it in the news in just a little bit.

73
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,420
And we are going to cover, because it was the Thanksgiving holiday in the States this

74
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,540
week, which I hope you all had an awesome Thanksgiving and all that good stuff.

75
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,540
Those of you in the States anyway, if you're in other countries, you probably was just

76
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,160
another week for you, but I hope you had a good week nonetheless.

77
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,740
But since it was the Thanksgiving holiday in the States, there probably wasn't as much

78
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
gaming news this week.

79
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,740
There was a little bit.

80
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,740
We'll get into that.

81
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,820
But we're going to kind of combine the week we missed last week and touch on some of the

82
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,120
big headlines from last week, because there's, Loki, there's some big stuff that happened

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,400
last week that we've got to give our insight on.

84
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,480
Like this whole E3 change.

85
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
We'll get to that later.

86
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
Yeah.

87
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
Yeah.

88
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
That's interesting.

89
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
Anyway.

90
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,560
But to start off the show tonight, let me tell you about why I wasn't here last week.

91
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,760
So I was in Las Vegas and I was attending Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival in Las Vegas,

92
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,880
which was at the Rio Hotel, which is just off the strip.

93
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,080
About 5,000 people going to this event.

94
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,080
I'm guessing that number based off the raffle ticket numbers that ran from zero to 5,000.

95
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,720
That's why I'm assuming there's about 5,000 people.

96
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,120
Maybe you add in some press and things like that too is maybe like 5,500, but about 5,000

97
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:27,320
people give or take at this convention center at the Rio to celebrate Final Fantasy XIV,

98
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,040
which is of course the online Final Fantasy game.

99
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,240
There is an older online Final Fantasy game, Final Fantasy XI, but that game, they kind

100
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,440
of stopped doing expansions and all that for a little while ago.

101
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,240
They're doing more minor updates with that game.

102
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,200
I think there's a much larger player base on Final Fantasy XIV because it is the newer

103
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
one.

104
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,880
It is the game that's on PlayStation 4 as well as PC.

105
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,560
And so this was really to celebrate that game.

106
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
And they did do the new expansion.

107
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,240
So I was out there in the audience during the keynote.

108
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,400
If you guys were watching on Twitch, I think there actually was a moment you probably could

109
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,440
have seen me on camera, which would have had to know where to look.

110
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,440
And I don't, I always find my reactions and those crowd shots really weird.

111
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,240
So I usually try to look away anyway.

112
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,120
But I was there when they unveiled the brand new expansion.

113
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,320
Shadowbringers is the new expansion that they're doing for Final Fantasy XIV.

114
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,520
I keep wanting to call it Stormbringers because the current expansion is Stormblood.

115
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,040
And for some reason, it's another SB acronym.

116
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,800
So you have Stormblood is the current expansion and Shadowbringers is the new one.

117
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,120
The first one was Heavensward.

118
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,400
So it was nothing SB, but it's weird that both acronyms are SB.

119
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
So I keep wanting to say Stormbringers.

120
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Heavens...

121
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
I don't know.

122
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Yeah.

123
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Heavensbringer.

124
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Yeah.

125
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Heavensworb.

126
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
So that's the new expansion.

127
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,080
And with that, they announced the Blue Mage job is going to be a part of actually Stormblood.

128
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,160
It's going to be in the next patch, a little bit controversial.

129
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
This Blue Mage implementation, because they're not implementing it like a normal job.

130
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,920
They are going to be doing kind of like a special little, I guess, side events that

131
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,900
you do more in a solo manner.

132
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,100
And it's going to be capped at level 50.

133
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,720
And you can do this whole like mass carnival up to, you know, level like 50 events and

134
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
things.

135
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,400
You go out in the field and learn spells.

136
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,760
Apparently you can do things in small groups like up to level 50, but what they're trying

137
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,640
to do is they're trying to keep Blue Mage out of current rating and the current meta

138
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,840
and out of progression.

139
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,040
And that's a very controversial change because there's some people out there that were very

140
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,600
much looking forward to Blue Mage and being able to play that in the progression.

141
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,520
So it's kind of like you get this kind of like awkward implementation of the Blue Mage

142
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
job.

143
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,480
And so it's rubbing some people the wrong way.

144
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,920
For me, I guess we're lucky it's there at all in a way, but I'll give it a chance.

145
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I'll check it out.

146
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,120
I think I'll change that once the other expansion comes out.

147
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
See, and that's the thing.

148
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
They could.

149
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,640
Maybe if the Rabble Rabble is really great and, you know, they could always retinker

150
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,740
it to allow Blue Mage to just cap up to level 80, which will be the new level cap, and be

151
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,300
in the progression content and maybe limit the skills.

152
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,560
I think they're really worried about balancing.

153
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,720
And they were really worried about Blue Mages getting rejected from parties because they

154
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,000
don't know all the spells because there's going to be, they said, 49 spells you go out

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,360
and absorb from monsters.

156
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,340
That's the whole thing with Blue Mage, by the way, if you weren't familiar in Final

157
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,000
Fantasy lore, like in games like Final Fantasy V, you would learn spells as a Blue Mage by

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,720
fighting the monsters and getting it cast on you basically.

159
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,600
And then you may learn the spell and they're kind of implementing it that way in Final

160
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Fantasy XIV.

161
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,140
Except I don't think, I think you just have to fight the mob.

162
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,560
You don't necessarily have to have the spell cast on you, but still, you know, relatively

163
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
close.

164
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Interesting implementation.

165
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,640
We'll see where they go with that.

166
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
I think it's very interesting.

167
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,240
It is not a part of the expansion.

168
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,580
It's part of this expansion.

169
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,240
So it's something that's leading into the next expansion.

170
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
So it's in the new expansion.

171
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,720
Yes, there will be more jobs in the new expansion.

172
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,680
They didn't say what those are.

173
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,460
There's a leak that called this Blue Mage thing and some other things.

174
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,440
So if you want to believe the leak, there's going to be two more jobs.

175
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,340
I'll let you go find that for yourself if you want to go look it up.

176
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,620
The other big thing that they teased, I'm very happy about this.

177
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,020
So in years past at this event, Yoshida, who's the producer and director of XIV, he wears

178
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,060
a t-shirt that will tease something about the expansion.

179
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:20,220
So a couple of years ago, he wore a Batman t-shirt and at the next Fan Fest, Dark Knight

180
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,220
was a job.

181
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,220
Get it?

182
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:28,260
So then last time he wore a Scarlet Witch t-shirt and guess what got announced at the

183
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
next Fan Fest?

184
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,260
Red Mage, right?

185
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,260
Get it?

186
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:37,340
So this time he wore a Bugs Bunny shirt and he pointed at it when he was talking about

187
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,740
the new race.

188
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,500
Although he wouldn't say what the new race was, but it's pretty much saying without saying

189
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,860
that the Viera from Final Fantasy XII will pretty much certainly be the new race in Final

190
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,860
Fantasy XIV.

191
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,700
It's just not totally confirmed yet, but what other bunny races are out there and it's,

192
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,540
I mean, I'm super happy.

193
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,900
Like obviously like Fran is one of my all time favorite Final Fantasy characters.

194
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,780
What he means to tell you is Space Jam is coming to you.

195
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:08,180
I would be okay with that actually if that, you know, Final Fantasy XIV in Space Jam.

196
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,180
Exactly.

197
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,020
It's like, all right, cool.

198
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,060
Now one of the other big things they announced in the keynote was this trust system.

199
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,180
So you're going to be able to, and Final Fantasy XI has this, they implemented it way later

200
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,380
when the game was dying off and it was harder to find parties.

201
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,260
What they did is they made it so that you could have NPCs in your party basically, and

202
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,620
they would function like normal party members.

203
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,740
They're bringing that system to Final Fantasy XIV, but they're not doing it because Final

204
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,060
Fantasy XIV is dying off.

205
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,220
At least they're certainly not going to admit that's the case.

206
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,240
And I don't think the game is.

207
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,780
They're doing it because, this is really interesting, they realize that there are some people that

208
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:53,780
although they want to play an MMO with friends, the story makes you do like dungeons and group

209
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,940
content to progress in the story.

210
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,140
Some people don't want to do the group content because they feel like if they're not pulling

211
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,980
their weight, they're holding the group back.

212
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,740
And it kind of gives that whole like anxiety of, you know, I'm playing with other people

213
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,320
and they are relying on me and I don't want to fuck up.

214
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,460
So basically they're going to allow you to do, use these trusts to help you get through

215
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,140
the story and do content without other people.

216
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,660
And it's, it's very strange because that was kind of a theme between that and the Bloom

217
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,820
Age experience.

218
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,940
I kind of felt like a theme I was hearing about this expansion was, here is an MMO you

219
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,500
can play all by yourself.

220
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,580
And I thought that was just very interesting.

221
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,220
But I totally recognize, and I've even been in this position before that sometimes you

222
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,480
don't necessarily want to play with other people.

223
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,660
You just want to be in the experience at the same time other people are experiencing it.

224
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,960
So you can talk about that or life or whatever.

225
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,680
It's a chat room with fire spells and great swords.

226
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,800
That's what it is.

227
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,420
That's what the MMO world is to some people.

228
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,780
And that's totally fine.

229
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:02,240
So I think it's very interesting that you have Final Fantasy XIV kind of embracing the

230
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,400
solo experience in an MMO.

231
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
What do you think?

232
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,360
I know you don't play a lot of MMOs currently, Loki, but you spend a lot of time with Final

233
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,800
Fantasy XI and so forth.

234
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,480
I know you've dabbled in a few of them.

235
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,220
What do you think about like the solo experience in MMO?

236
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,240
Like do you think MMOs should be built to play alone?

237
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Sure.

238
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,600
I like playing Final Fantasy XI alone.

239
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Yeah.

240
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Sometimes.

241
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,320
Unless I was up against a roadblock that I needed to have a party, like any sort of experience.

242
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,720
You get the trusts and you don't need that anymore.

243
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Granted.

244
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Interesting.

245
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,080
I didn't really have that problem when I was playing on that not so legit server where

246
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,160
the XP boost was like times 10 and that was awesome because then I could solo all the

247
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,680
way up to whatever I need to.

248
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,680
Let's go to our chat room for some feedback on this because we do tape live every Sunday

249
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,400
night at the voice of geeks network, vognetwork.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night

250
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,000
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

251
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
And you can join us in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

252
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,560
But I do want to start plugging away here when I mention it because, you know, I mentioned

253
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,520
this at the top of every show, but I do want to start mentioning if you aren't already

254
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,040
following the network on Twitch TV, you might want to get over there and get on that vognetwork

255
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,920
over on Twitch TV because that is where we're going to be in the future in about a month

256
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,200
if all things stay on track.

257
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,320
Anyway, some of the comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

258
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,440
Dungeon Buster says, this is a nice gesture for 14.

259
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,800
Pugs can either be awesome experiences or toxic nightmares.

260
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,920
It's super nice to drop into a group of nice players, but getting toxic ones can ruin your

261
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,320
night.

262
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
And that's exactly right.

263
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,560
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I can still optionally play with friends.

264
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,480
I hated having to be like, hey, Free Company, while you're out there playing Moogle Mog,

265
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,520
can you help me with this four person dungeon way beneath you?

266
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,280
Yeah, like maybe some people, you know, they want to be able to do the old stuff without

267
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,240
having to ask people to run through it with them.

268
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,880
So yeah, it's something that trust is going to open up.

269
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,240
It's gonna be very interesting.

270
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,920
So anyway, you know, I'm sure a lot of the announcements have been online.

271
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,800
I don't want to, I don't want to retread that territory too much.

272
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,920
So what else happened at this event besides the keynote?

273
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Well, they did a variety of panels.

274
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,080
So they did some panels talking about the next patch that's going to include Blue Mage.

275
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,920
They went into detail on Blue Mage.

276
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,640
They did like a PvP tournament there, which I'm not super into PvP and 14.

277
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,920
So it wasn't really something that was up my alley, but I know it is for some people.

278
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,720
So that was cool.

279
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,480
They did a big costume contest.

280
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,480
And let me tell you, the cosplay was like Dragon Con level good.

281
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,720
Like Final Fantasy 14 cosplayers go all out and there was some really good stuff.

282
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,120
So that was really cool to see.

283
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,080
And they do like lore panels and all that stuff as well.

284
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,200
While that's going on, it was interesting because this year they had it split.

285
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,600
They had the very large room was kind of like their panel room.

286
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,120
And they had some events in there.

287
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,520
I can't remember if I posted this on Twitter,

288
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,440
but I took a picture of myself in front of this giant makeshift aetheryte crystal,

289
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,960
which is like a home crystal doing the little pose like I'm tuning to the crystal.

290
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,320
So that is something that they had like in that room.

291
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,360
And they had like some little silly carnival games that you could win,

292
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,200
like posters and stickers and, you know, very silly things for playing.

293
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,480
So that was kind of neat.

294
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,600
But then inside rooms, of course, they had one room that was all about playing Final Fantasy 14.

295
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:19,040
And you could stand in line to do a new primal fight, Yojimbo as a primal fight,

296
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,040
which Yojimbo is actually already, I mean, Yojimbo is already in Final Fantasy 10.

297
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,840
That's where he comes from.

298
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,200
But Yojimbo is already a dungeon boss, but they redid him for a primal fight.

299
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,440
And all I'm going to say about it, I'm not going to spoil it.

300
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,200
It's not the same as the dungeon fight.

301
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,400
It's very, very different because there's a big twist at the beginning of the fight.

302
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,200
You're not really fighting Yojimbo, you're fighting somebody else.

303
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,760
So that's all I'm going to say about that fight.

304
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,040
And then, let's see, you could do one of the existing primal fights,

305
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,360
which is basically, you know, eight people taking on a boss.

306
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,080
But they would have various modifiers, like the bottom half of your screen is unusable,

307
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,840
or it's covered up entirely, basically,

308
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,400
which kind of sucks because that's where your skills and actions are.

309
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,160
Or other silly modifiers like, you know, you could only use certain type of weapons,

310
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,920
or it was sped up, or, you know, like half health or something.

311
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,960
Like there'd be all these different modifiers, so that was something you could,

312
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,920
I think maybe one was that the bosses didn't telegraph any moves.

313
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,960
That's pretty horrible too.

314
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,400
So yeah, there was, you could play the hard stuff.

315
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,960
There was some type of like Eureka challenge where you kind of,

316
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,040
so they basically had like different little like sub games within the game

317
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,760
that it uses the game's engine and the game's setup,

318
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,840
but they're not really things that you can do in the game right now at home.

319
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,800
So it's kind of neat that they have, you know, that whole thing set up.

320
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,880
And then, of course, they had a big old merchandise booth

321
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,720
and they were selling a lot of that stuff.

322
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,880
And, you know, I know this festival for a lot of people is a chance to meet up with

323
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,400
free company members or guild members and people that they play the game with.

324
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,720
I met a lot of new people.

325
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,960
I had a good time meeting some new people that played the game

326
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,560
and reconnecting with people that I used to play with.

327
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,360
Like one of my old buddies that I played with back on McGarsimer was there.

328
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,680
And so it was really cool to reconnect with him.

329
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,120
And yeah, just, you know, it's about kind of the community as well as the game.

330
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:15,040
So that was what I kind of, I guess, skipped the show to see last week.

331
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,880
Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

332
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,760
Oh, I guess Shane joined our chat room or somebody that knows him very well

333
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,720
because the nickname is Shane Hates 14 Bloom Age.

334
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,440
Yeah, I know he wasn't too happy with the implementation of that.

335
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,960
Says in our chat says, despite some information that made people matter upset overall,

336
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,080
the con was the best they've done for North America so far.

337
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,480
Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up because I will say that is that the last two times I went,

338
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,280
so they've done this every other year in the even numbered years to announce their other expansions

339
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,440
and 2014 with Heaven's Word, like the registration line was very long.

340
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,360
The merchandise line was a nightmare.

341
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,680
2016 had some issues as well.

342
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,960
So like this year organization, I will give kudos to Square Enix, was done very well.

343
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,360
There was no line for registration.

344
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,960
Like not you walked right up.

345
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,400
They scanned your code. You got your packet. You got your backpack.

346
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't know if you saw that when he came in, but I got a little Final Fantasy 14 backpack

347
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,160
and it had like loot inside it. So it's kind of nice.

348
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,680
You just walked right in and pick that up.

349
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,680
Even though they, this was the first year because of, you know,

350
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,960
incidents that have happened in Las Vegas in the not too distant, you know,

351
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,000
past and so forth.

352
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,800
They had metal detectors for the first time that we all had to go through on the way in.

353
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,280
And when I read that they were going to do that, I was like, oh God,

354
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,600
that line to get in is going to be a mile long.

355
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,680
It wasn't. I was pleasantly surprised.

356
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,080
We moved right along into that thing.

357
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,480
They got us through that nice and early to put us in a queue room in the back.

358
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,280
So that way the metal detectors weren't a choke point

359
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,840
because people were lining up as early as like 5, 6 a.m.

360
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,920
I know Shane went out there really, really early the day of the keynote.

361
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,760
And so that was nice that the metal detectors didn't become a bottleneck.

362
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,360
So, and they did the merchandise sales in advance online.

363
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,880
So you have to stand in line all day just to decide what you wanted at the merch booth.

364
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,360
So honestly, they just did a lot of things that made it feel a lot smoother.

365
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,240
But at the same time, because all of it was so smooth,

366
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,600
you really started to notice the whole like, well, I'm kind of out of things to do.

367
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,360
There's no panel right now.

368
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,680
I've done the Yojimbo fight and all this other stuff.

369
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,800
And the thing about Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest is that's all it is,

370
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,320
is Final Fantasy XIV stuff.

371
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,120
But here's the thing.

372
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,320
So you realize you're out of things to do.

373
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,680
That's the time that you go hang out with your free company

374
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,360
or you meet some new people and hang out with them and so forth.

375
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,800
So that's part of the whole experience, I suppose.

376
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,320
Talking about being in the same place and existing at the same time.

377
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,640
We're talking about like the solo experience in an MMO and so forth.

378
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,440
So yeah.

379
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,800
Okay, now I know it's Shane because he knows this.

380
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,720
He says in chat, Rob got stopped every time at the metal detector.

381
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,760
Take that how you will.

382
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,480
Yes, that's true.

383
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,640
I set that metal detector off every single stinking time.

384
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,800
And it wasn't my belt.

385
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,680
It wasn't my watch.

386
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,320
I don't know what it is.

387
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
But every single time I was setting off that metal detector.

388
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,760
And they'd have to do the whole wand.

389
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,520
And of course, they don't find anything with a wand.

390
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,320
So I don't know what it is.

391
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,680
It's my magnetic personality.

392
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,440
No, I don't know what was setting it off.

393
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,320
It was weird.

394
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,240
Anyway, let's see.

395
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,760
Looking at other comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

396
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,280
Shane is also reminding me to talk about the data centers.

397
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,240
So yeah, with...

398
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,280
And this is the last thing we'll talk about,

399
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,360
because then I want to move on with some of the other headlines from the week.

400
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,720
But one of the other really controversial things they're doing with Final Fantasy XIV,

401
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,880
and I'm going to just flat out say one of the things I don't like.

402
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,720
I know Shane is really pissed off about this blue mage thing.

403
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,080
But honestly, with the blue mage thing, I'm like,

404
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,680
all right, it's there and they can always fix it later.

405
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,080
But this is the thing where I'm like, ugh, I wish they hadn't done this.

406
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,280
But I understand why they're doing it.

407
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,040
So what they're doing is they're making a third data center in North America.

408
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,640
There's already two data centers.

409
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,920
They're making a third.

410
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,200
And here's the thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can do cross data center.

411
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,240
But it's not like World of Warcraft,

412
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,960
where admittedly in the early days of World of Warcraft,

413
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,880
you could only do things on one server.

414
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,800
But about three or four expansions in,

415
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,120
they made it so that it didn't matter what server you were on.

416
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,080
You could party up with people on any other server and so forth.

417
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,000
In Final Fantasy XIV, you're still limited by your data center.

418
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,720
So sure, you can transfer between servers,

419
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,120
but it has to be servers on your data center.

420
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,160
And now in the new expansions in Shadowbringers,

421
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,080
they're going to do this whole world,

422
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,320
or actually, no, I think this is part of the 4.5 patch.

423
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,640
You can even go visit another server,

424
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,960
but it still has to be within the data center.

425
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,840
So there is still this big wall because my friends that I used to play with

426
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,800
are on Midgarcimer, which is one data center,

427
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,200
and I'm on the other one now, Hyperion.

428
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,320
So there's still this wall.

429
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,040
I can't play with the people I used to play with because we're still on this.

430
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,200
And the problem is, in the new expansion,

431
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,280
they're going to be adding a third data center.

432
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,880
So now there's going to be two walls.

433
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,680
And they took the most populated server, Bao Mung,

434
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,560
which there's a lot of inside jokes about Bao Mung and the role play,

435
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,760
and it's going to the third server with a bunch of low pop servers.

436
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
So all these people are having to,

437
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,240
if they have a cross-server group that's on a data center,

438
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,120
it might be getting split up because of this change.

439
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,080
But that was also kind of the nice thing about having some downtime,

440
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,760
is that you kind of start to ask people,

441
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,040
so what's your server?

442
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Oh, you're going to be on the new one with me.

443
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,920
OK, so we should talk more because maybe we'll be able to group up.

444
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,600
It's like people are suddenly finding their new homes and things like that.

445
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,840
It's like Final Fantasy XI all over again.

446
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,120
Yeah, yeah, a little bit.

447
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,920
So it's unfortunate about the whole data center thing,

448
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,240
and I really hope in the near future

449
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,400
they can really figure out how to take down those walls of the data center.

450
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,200
But I feel like it's one of those things that they're kind of,

451
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,800
I feel like it's one of those things they're kind of trapped in.

452
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,600
They're kind of trapped into it because of the way the game was built.

453
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,120
Because remember, Final Fantasy XIV had a horrible first version,

454
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,920
and they've been trying to fix it ever since, basically.

455
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,960
So I just have this weird feeling they're kind of screwed in from that,

456
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,240
but we'll see, we'll see.

457
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
Anyway, that's enough about Fan Fest.

458
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,280
Is there anything else I should be saying about Fan Fest, Loki?

459
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,400
Any news on Final Fantasy XI Mobile that was supposed to be...

460
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,080
No, this is only a XIV.

461
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,120
No news on anything else but Final Fantasy XIV.

462
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,640
That's about XIV right now.

463
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,440
Yeah, right.

464
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,240
Until it goes like, you know, monthly fee free, then maybe.

465
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,080
Okay, so Bobby Blackwolf in chat, let me explain this better.

466
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,920
Bobby says, oh, so I can't transfer my character over to the server you're on?

467
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,080
So as a kind of like, sorry, we're screwing up all your like pre-mades and stuff.

468
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,800
What they're doing is they're saying for a two-week period,

469
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,760
we are going to offer free server transfers.

470
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,200
So when they create this third data center, it's going to be,

471
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,320
it is going to be a nut house because everybody's going to use this opportunity

472
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,920
of free data transfers to go to where they want to go.

473
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,680
Now, once you've figured out what server you're going to be on,

474
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,400
Final Fantasy is also implementing this.

475
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,400
You can temporarily visit other servers within the data center.

476
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,400
You can just kind of do that within game,

477
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,120
but you'll be locked into that data center once the free move period is over.

478
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,040
So I hope that makes sense because right now,

479
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,640
you can move a character to any server you want for like 15, 18 bucks.

480
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,280
I don't know what it is.

481
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,640
I don't remember what it was I paid,

482
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,800
but they're going to open that up and make it free for two weeks

483
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,320
as their apology to, sorry, we're doing this big shuffle.

484
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,680
We feel bad about it.

485
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,440
So here's your chance to re-pick.

486
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,280
It's going to screw up a lot of housing stuff

487
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
because some people have invested a lot of gill in housing,

488
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,760
but they're trying, they're talking about reimbursements,

489
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,400
like 3 million.

490
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,640
They're trying to, they're trying to sweeten the pot.

491
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,000
I just, I don't know.

492
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,120
It's going to be, it's going to be a lot.

493
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,560
So I may not stay where I am, Bobby.

494
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,360
I will let you know.

495
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,040
I will let everybody, I'll tweet about it.

496
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,400
What world I decide to go to.

497
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,600
I honestly have not decided yet.

498
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,320
There's just so many factors.

499
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,080
I really have to kind of figure out

500
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,080
where are the people actually going to be playing regularly?

501
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,520
Because I've kind of hit a ghost town experience

502
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,480
on my old server and I've hit a ghost town experience

503
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,920
on my new server.

504
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,440
So I'll stay on the new server

505
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
if it's not going to be a ghost town anymore.

506
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,320
I'll go back to the old server

507
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,000
if it's not going to be a ghost town anymore.

508
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'll go to a third server, a brand new server,

509
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
if I find out there's a great community here

510
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,280
that, you know, wants to have Rob there and do stuff.

511
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,920
So I honestly don't have the answer to that question yet.

512
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,200
And I think a lot of that will start to sort itself out

513
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,920
when they announce the date of the server transfers.

514
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,120
So I'm just not totally focused on that right now

515
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,400
because, you know, patch 4.5 is still not even out

516
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,120
until January.

517
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,280
So the game is still a little bit stagnant until January.

518
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,760
It's why I've been playing, even though I'm subscribed to 14,

519
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,840
it's why I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft

520
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,800
in between there.

521
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,920
So anyway, let's see.

522
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,800
Hopefully I explained that a little better.

523
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,320
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

524
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,080
I'm also okay with starting from level one

525
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,520
because I forget how to play,

526
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,920
especially if you can access trust from the beginning.

527
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,360
Well, remember, Bobby, you can also just roll a new job

528
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,040
and you'll have to start it from level one.

529
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,080
And that could be another way

530
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,320
because maybe one of these new jobs will speak to you too.

531
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,280
Who knows?

532
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,120
So, you know, you got a lot of options.

533
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,080
So something to think about.

534
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,480
They haven't talked about how the trust

535
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,440
is going to be implemented.

536
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,360
So we'll see what happens with that.

537
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,800
All right.

538
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,720
I think that's all I want to say about Final Fantasy XIV

539
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,400
because I know not everybody plays the MMO

540
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,440
and I've talked at length about it.

541
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,720
We have plenty more news to get to

542
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,960
that has come up in the past couple of weeks.

543
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,400
Before we get to that, though,

544
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,760
let's talk about our gaming weeks

545
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,920
and the types of video games that we have been playing

546
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,160
these past couple of weeks while we've been out.

547
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,440
Loki, how was your gaming week?

548
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,720
My gaming week was all right.

549
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,160
I didn't play a whole ton of things,

550
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,280
but I did play a few things.

551
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,560
So I got around finally to pick,

552
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,400
I mentioned I was going to be picking up

553
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,240
Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu.

554
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,560
So I picked that up and I bought that

555
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,760
and I've been playing that quite a bit.

556
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,200
I'm like 20 hours into it.

557
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,600
I've already taken down five gyms

558
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,920
and I've gotten all the way to Fuchsia City.

559
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,120
Wow.

560
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,440
Where I've got my Pokemon Go Park stuff.

561
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,600
So it's great because, you know, it's like,

562
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,960
oh yeah, there's all these, you know,

563
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,120
version exclusive Pokemon and stuff.

564
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,240
I'm like, fuck that.

565
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,400
I've got like all this crap just sitting

566
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,920
on my Pokemon Go account.

567
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,760
I'm just going to throw it on in there.

568
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,880
Now, what am I doing with it?

569
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,680
Do I really need like 50 different Eevees?

570
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,400
No, I don't.

571
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,640
So I just put that all in there.

572
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,800
So it was great to kind of fill in on that stuff.

573
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,040
So right now I have a Pokemon Go Park

574
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,400
that's just full of like Pokemon.

575
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,960
You can actually have, I think you transfer

576
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
up to a thousand Pokemon into that.

577
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,280
So like I'm set for a while.

578
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,080
I should be good.

579
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,840
But I still have to catch everything

580
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,120
because I've ran out of berries.

581
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,560
That's kind of the annoying thing too.

582
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,760
It's like, hey, you know,

583
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,200
whereas like in Pokemon Go,

584
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,560
I have all these berries.

585
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,720
I'm literally like swimming in berries

586
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,080
in Pokemon Let's Go.

587
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,760
You can't fucking find those anywhere.

588
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,880
You have to keep catching things

589
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,000
and you sometimes get them

590
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,600
or you get them as bonuses for other things,

591
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,240
but you can't buy them, which is annoying.

592
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,920
Walk the Pokemon because you get.

593
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,000
I know, I know I do.

594
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,440
I was doing that.

595
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,360
And then the problem is those

596
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,960
I have to keep transferring it back.

597
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,640
And I don't, I keep switching

598
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,280
in between which Pokemon I want to level

599
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
up because I'm trying to figure out

600
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,200
what's going to be the best to have

601
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,320
against the final four.

602
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:19,920
So I don't know.

603
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,360
But I've been playing that quite a bit.

604
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,480
And it's been fun.

605
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,240
I've been a little bit grindy though,

606
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,040
but just, I found that trading

607
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,520
with randoms is also kind of working out too.

608
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,120
I didn't even realize that this was a thing.

609
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,240
So you just put in like,

610
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
cause the trading's weird.

611
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,520
You don't like, you don't go

612
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,960
to your friends list or anything

613
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,240
like you would in the other games.

614
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,280
You just basically say,

615
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,040
so you connect online and then you say,

616
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,680
put in a three, it's not even digit.

617
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,200
It's a three picture code.

618
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,800
It's just like, if you've played the rating

619
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,240
in Pokemon Go and done a private raid,

620
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,960
it's just like that.

621
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,240
But you're on the entire internet.

622
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,920
But there's a universal code

623
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,720
that everybody's using,

624
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,560
which is Pikachu, Pikachu, Pikachu.

625
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,840
It's the first one.

626
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,560
And if you do that,

627
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
you'll get matched up with some random person.

628
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,920
And so that's why it is like,

629
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,360
I was like, well, let me just check this out

630
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,920
and see whatever.

631
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,440
So I did it and then I was like,

632
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,320
okay, I'm going to give you,

633
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,400
cause I just caught a bunch of slow pokes.

634
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,320
I'm going to give you like a level 38 slow poke.

635
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,440
And so I did that and they,

636
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,800
oh, here, here's the Clefairy.

637
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm like, all right, that's cool.

638
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,400
Whatever.

639
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,840
I don't really care what I get.

640
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
But the Clefairy they got was like level 53.

641
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,320
Fuck yeah, I'm going to do this some more.

642
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,520
I've been doing the planned trades

643
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,640
with my buddy, Justin,

644
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,080
that I kind of reconnected with

645
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,840
at the Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest.

646
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,120
We've been able to do some trading

647
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,240
cause he has the Eevee version.

648
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,360
I have the Pikachu version.

649
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,640
So we've been able to trade

650
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,760
some of the exclusives across.

651
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,440
And like he texted me the other day

652
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,280
because he's like, do you have Graveler?

653
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,960
He's like in the exact same spot in the game I am.

654
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,640
So he's like, do you have a Graveler

655
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
that you want to like trade Graveler for Graveler

656
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,280
because some of the Pokemon evolve by trading them.

657
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,440
So we did Graveler for Graveler.

658
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,960
So that way we both got Golems.

659
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,080
And then I think we need to do it again

660
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,880
for the Kadabras to get Alakazams.

661
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
So I've been doing the pre-planned trades.

662
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,720
I haven't tried the random stuff though, but.

663
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,560
I should probably trade those then

664
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,080
cause I can't do anything with them

665
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,880
if they're just gonna sit there.

666
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,920
I'll just trade them.

667
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,560
Do you have your Switch?

668
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,200
Let's trade.

669
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
I don't have my Switch with me.

670
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,520
I thought about bringing it.

671
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,960
I almost did, but I didn't.

672
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,040
Next time.

673
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,640
Yeah, like Sia Tabiri in chat says

674
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,680
grav for grav.

675
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,800
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

676
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,200
G for G.

677
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,800
But yeah, and also it's nice

678
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,320
that each of the Pokemon centers

679
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
they have like people that'll trade you

680
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,520
the Alolan Pokemon.

681
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,960
So I got an Alolan Marowak,

682
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
which cause I don't even have that in Pokemon Go.

683
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,120
So just too bad because they had one

684
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,480
on the gym over here.

685
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,920
Just right when I came in.

686
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,400
I'm like, oh, there's someone battling him.

687
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,160
I can't.

688
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,680
Three stars or four stars.

689
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,080
Don't.

690
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,360
Can't solo that.

691
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,320
It's like recommend party.

692
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,960
13 people.

693
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,360
There's some of the three stars

694
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,240
you can do yourself.

695
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,800
Yeah, yeah.

696
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,320
Anyways.

697
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,080
So I've been playing that quite a bit.

698
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,360
And then aside from that,

699
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,960
you know, Pokemon Go,

700
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,720
I did ended up picking up the controller,

701
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,200
the Pokeball Plus only because my kids

702
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,920
wanted to play with it.

703
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,320
My youngest son was like really wanting

704
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,080
to play Pokemon and he wanted the ball.

705
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,280
So like I picked it up and then my oldest son

706
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,800
wanted me to give him Mew.

707
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,240
I'm like.

708
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,000
But I bought this myself.

709
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,600
You know, when you get a job,

710
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,160
you can have me up to, you know, I'm like fine.

711
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,520
I'll give it to you.

712
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,360
Unfortunately, you can't give it to him

713
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,440
because he doesn't have a Nintendo account.

714
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
So sorry, you're out of luck.

715
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
So I had to transfer Mew over.

716
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,880
Mew actually is all right, but.

717
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,720
The only positive with Mew is you can give it

718
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,400
any of the TMS so you can, you know,

719
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,960
kind of customize Mew however you want.

720
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,880
Yeah, I have Mew in my party right now,

721
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,160
but I'm probably going to take him out.

722
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,280
Like I just I need other like harder counters,

723
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,160
if that makes sense.

724
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,520
Yeah, I need things like

725
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,080
ride on.

726
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,960
I need things like, you know,

727
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,720
that are just like really big.

728
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,080
I still haven't been able to get mine to evolve yet.

729
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,360
My ride on.

730
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,680
I don't know if that's one of the ones

731
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,200
you have to trade or if you just it's

732
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,320
a higher level when it flips.

733
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,120
Whatever, if it doesn't, you know.

734
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,360
Just transfer in a Brian once you go.

735
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,040
Yeah, like, yeah, seriously.

736
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,640
So that's kind of what I've been doing.

737
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,600
And then let's see, aside from that.

738
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,320
So my DDR machine finally got the replacement

739
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,040
optical drive in last week.

740
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,360
And sure enough, I put it in there

741
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,720
and it doesn't fucking work.

742
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,240
So so then there was that problem

743
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,080
and it started acting up like I was like,

744
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,440
OK, well, what's wrong with this thing?

745
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,400
Because it kept popping the tray out a bunch of times

746
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,560
and it just was not cooperating.

747
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,280
It wouldn't read it.

748
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,680
So I ended up having to take the optical drive apart

749
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,120
and I fixed it because I guess as they get older,

750
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,840
the motors to pop the trays open and stuff like that,

751
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,440
they wear out.

752
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,320
And so you have to basically break the magnet

753
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,080
that's in there a little bit and, you know,

754
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,400
tweak it up so that it's higher off of the metal

755
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,320
so that it's not strong.

756
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,360
And then it works just fine.

757
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,200
And sure enough, as soon as I did all that

758
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,760
and tweaked it and put it back together, it worked fine.

759
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,000
So I was able to put fourth plus on my DDR machine now.

760
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,320
So that's what I'm being playing this week.

761
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,200
Um, although I miss having my speed mods already,

762
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,120
I'm like, man, I loved fourth plus or fourth mix,

763
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,600
but I'm so spoiled I can't do it anymore.

764
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,360
It's like, you know, it's trying to play doubles.

765
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,240
I was playing a conga feeling and I love that song,

766
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,360
but it's just it's going to have to get used to

767
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,400
reading that stuff again.

768
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,160
I can't wait to come over and play your DDR machine.

769
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,680
We just had a day to do that.

770
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,280
Yeah, awesome.

771
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,840
So anytime.

772
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:40,720
Okay.

773
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,160
Anything else for your gaming week?

774
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,120
Um, no, that's it.

775
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,720
I didn't play any Red Dead Redemption,

776
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,600
which is too bad.

777
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,680
I'm having trouble like getting back into that

778
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,240
because it's just so like engrossing.

779
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,800
Um, I, I'm loving some of the clips I'm seeing

780
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,760
coming out of that game.

781
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,720
Like the, the lady was like, won't you help me?

782
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,960
And like, then she gets run over by a horse.

783
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,000
Like, just like out of nowhere, this horse comes just like,

784
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,080
it's, I guess it might be like a bug,

785
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,440
but it's like a really funny bug.

786
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,400
AI is never been like, great.

787
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,000
I mean, they, they do pretty well,

788
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,840
but like sometimes the pathfinding and stuff

789
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,040
is not really great.

790
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
And also deer are kind of crazy,

791
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,120
but there's a lot of weird shit in that game.

792
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,840
Like there's like UFOs and ghosts and all sorts of like,

793
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,280
there's time travelers and stuff.

794
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,360
And there's, there's ties between this and

795
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,920
Grand Theft Auto five with, um, the, uh, Epsilon cult thing,

796
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,800
Epsilon project or, and so weird.

797
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,240
I want to play Red Dead, but I'm not until it goes on sale,

798
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,680
which will be a good long time.

799
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,240
So it won't be that long, but it's a great game.

800
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,200
It's definitely worth it.

801
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,000
Um, I just, it's, it's very engrossing.

802
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,920
And I just, I haven't been able to work,

803
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,280
be on the TV is the problem.

804
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,320
It's my wife's been still watching all sorts of garbage.

805
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
What Shondaverse show is she on now?

806
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,160
She just finished season two of a Handmaid's Tale.

807
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,320
So now she's watching, I don't even fucking know.

808
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,200
It's just garbage.

809
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,160
It's all garbage.

810
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,760
Like I don't even care anymore.

811
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,360
It's just, it's some drama.

812
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,080
It's, it's anything that's got a drama in it, you know?

813
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,960
Look, we have goddamn fucking Netflix on the TV in the bedroom.

814
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,680
It's like you can watch TV and sit in bed.

815
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,040
I'm almost at the point where I have to move

816
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,640
my PlayStation in the bedroom, but like,

817
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,880
I have a 4k fucking TV and a PlayStation pro.

818
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,640
I don't want to move it onto the tape.

819
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,120
And you lose on the switch.

820
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,560
You could watch that literally anywhere.

821
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,480
Well, we don't necessarily have Hulu.

822
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,040
We have a wild world on the internet.

823
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,360
I see.

824
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,400
Oh, I thought you were watching him.

825
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,600
No, no.

826
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,760
Yeah.

827
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,840
Hulu would be nice too, but we just don't do it.

828
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,400
So I haven't been able to play that.

829
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,520
And my friends wanted me to get like Fallout 76,

830
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,720
but that game is shit.

831
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,840
So, you know, but I like shit games sometimes.

832
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,440
I just don't want to pay, I don't know, $40 for it.

833
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
I don't usually get super into the Fallout games.

834
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,800
Like I think Ma, the, the, the, um, I almost said the Skyrim games,

835
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,120
the Elder Scrolls games are kind of more my thing.

836
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,480
I live for from Bethesda.

837
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,680
I've tried the Fallout games.

838
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,120
I just don't really get into them the same way,

839
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,200
but I'm not hearing good things about this new one.

840
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,600
Like, I'm just like, everything I'm hearing about this new one is like,

841
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,600
like, I guess maybe passing on this is probably the right thing to do.

842
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,520
They've already dropped it half price now.

843
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,800
That's $39.99.

844
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,680
That's crazy to me.

845
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,440
It's seriously, this game is like,

846
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,720
it's no man's sky all over again.

847
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,000
It just seems like it was half baked.

848
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,240
Yeah.

849
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
Oh, it wasn't even half baked.

850
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,640
It was like quarter baked.

851
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,720
You're like, it is eating the cookie dough.

852
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,520
It is like you might, those raw eggs might kill you.

853
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,320
Like it, it's just, it's, it's bad.

854
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,640
It's bad, but like everybody I talked to, they're having a lot of fun with it,

855
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,400
but like as some of the, one of the online reviews I watched,

856
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,720
you know, they, they compared it to like Billy Madison,

857
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,640
where Billy Madison proves that you can have fun with a flaming bag of shit.

858
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,080
It's like why I watch showgirls.

859
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,880
Yeah, you can have movies.

860
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,880
You can have fun with all sorts of dumb shit with friends.

861
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,520
I get it.

862
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,160
But it doesn't mean it's a good thing.

863
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,880
I hear you.

864
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,120
All right.

865
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,560
So that's, that's, that's my game.

866
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:04,800
All right.

867
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,680
My gaming week.

868
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,120
I've also been playing Pokemon.

869
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,760
Let's go.

870
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,080
Um, um, Loki's talked at length about it.

871
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,960
I won't say a whole lot more except for, I like the fact that it's just basically

872
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,080
like Pokemon yellow.

873
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,840
Cause I have a Pikachu version as well.

874
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,760
And I saw a question in chat earlier that asked why, why the Pikachu version,

875
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,880
not the Eevee version.

876
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,640
My kids, they want a Pikachu.

877
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,920
I know I could have gotten Eevee because Pikachu is literally like

878
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,120
right there at the beginning of the game.

879
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,520
Yeah.

880
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,120
But they wanted me to get the Pikachu version.

881
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,200
Um, I got the Pikachu version because just kind of informal poll on Twitter

882
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,560
of everybody else I know like Eevee seemed to be the more popular one.

883
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,400
So I got Pikachu just so I could do the trading so that that's really it.

884
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,080
There wasn't a whole lot of thought beyond that.

885
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,160
Um, and now thanks to the connection with Pokemon go and the fighting,

886
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,920
you just pretty much bring anything in from that.

887
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,240
Like you don't even really need, it doesn't really matter which version of

888
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,840
the game you have, I guess in that regard.

889
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,160
Um, but I do like it, it kind of does feel Loki like a, a Bobby black Wolf

890
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,600
mode version of, and if you don't know that inside joke, that's what

891
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,960
you call like the easy mode of a game is Bobby black Wolf mode.

892
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,320
Uh, is, uh, it kind of feels like the Bobby black Wolf mode of Pokemon

893
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,920
yellow because I do, I got to admit, I love that they took the like

894
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,440
grinding of the catching of the mobs out of it and they've just replaced

895
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,320
it with the much simpler, like flick your wrist and catch it that way.

896
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,360
Still pretty grindy.

897
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,680
And I don't even do the flicking wrist stuff because I use it in handheld

898
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,000
mode.

899
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,880
So for me, it's just motion controls.

900
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,360
No, I do.

901
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,880
I, I, I was able to get the flick.

902
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,400
I can even throw them left and right now.

903
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,200
I kind of figured out how to, you just, what you do, you, you move your

904
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,520
hand to the right and you do a quarter turn of the little, um, no, but

905
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,760
that's how you make sure that's how I throw things to the right and the

906
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,720
left every time is as I actually throw it to the left, I do a quarter

907
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,040
turn of the controller and it always nails it.

908
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,840
So that's, that's kind of what's worked for me.

909
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:55,760
Um, but I, I got basically in, I'm only catch one of each Pokemon and

910
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,600
then I move on like, and I think I have kind of missed some stuff.

911
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,480
I think you have to get that catch combo going in order to get your

912
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,120
shinies.

913
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,800
Yeah, but I don't need shinies right out the gate.

914
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,680
You know what I need to do is beat a fucking Pokemon game.

915
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,280
Then I'll go back and get the shinies.

916
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,240
If you complete the pokey decks, you'll get a shiny charm.

917
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,920
Then they'll make catching the shinies either.

918
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,160
So I don't give a fuck about shinies right now.

919
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,080
I want to get mildly easier.

920
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,280
I'm sick of getting teased because I cannot beat a Pokemon game.

921
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,400
So I'm going to beat this one.

922
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,800
Damn it.

923
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,240
I'm, I'm not as far as you though.

924
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,080
I'm only three gyms down, but there's a long trek between gyms two and three.

925
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,640
And then now there's another long trek trek between three and four.

926
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,280
So I just did the ghost tower, but I wasn't able to get all the way at the

927
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,080
top.

928
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,560
So then I had to trigger the team rocket sequence.

929
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,760
And that's about where I'm at right now without saying too much where I'm at.

930
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,120
Um, but honestly, because then it just ends up being battle, battle, battle.

931
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,600
Like you just battle all the NPCs over and over and over again.

932
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,160
Like that's kind of how I grind NPCs by doing that.

933
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,520
And by walking the Pokemon and Poke ball, because you get an insane amount of XP

934
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:55,760
from that.

935
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,360
And you can avoid a lot of them too, but like, I don't know.

936
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,120
You need it for XP.

937
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,960
So yeah, that's how I get my XP because I'm not really catching.

938
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,600
So anyway, that's enough said about a Pokemon.

939
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,000
Let's go.

940
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,800
I think if you're a fan of the Pokemon series, you've probably already.

941
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,320
I always, I just pick them up because anything that you pick up, that's extra.

942
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,640
Those, the stuff you can trade them in to the professor for candy and for candy.

943
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,960
And you can stat boost your Pokemon that way.

944
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,120
Yeah, I figure I can always go back and do that again.

945
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,400
The walking Loki you get, I know I get, I have, I've gotten so much Charmander

946
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:28,880
candy.

947
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,280
I've probably like poured like 40 Charmander candies into my now Charmeleon,

948
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,200
who I'm surprised is not a Charizard at this point.

949
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,840
Cause the other two are Venusaur.

950
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,400
Yeah, I know.

951
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,920
I think it's just like one or two levels behind.

952
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,800
But anyway, um, so anyhow, talking about some other things I've played this week,

953
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,320
of course, I've been continuing on in Final Fantasy 14 because, uh, you know,

954
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,800
the, uh, the festival kind of got me jazzed on that again.

955
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,160
But I've also been playing World of Warcraft.

956
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,680
So my buddy Delvin has been helping me run through some mythics and I'll plug

957
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,680
his Twitch channel over at VG realness.

958
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,640
Cause sometimes I pop in on his Twitch channel over there.

959
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,000
Um, and, uh, we'll do, uh, some mythics.

960
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,080
I've done some mythics with him and some other stuff.

961
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,000
I've also been oddly getting back into PVP, which I didn't think was something I

962
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,760
was into, but it's really fun on an affliction warlock for any of you that are

963
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,560
into wow.

964
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,280
Um, you will be very happy to know this Loki.

965
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,560
One of the thing I did this week is I really spent some time with the VR

966
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,360
playing some other games besides just Tetris effect.

967
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,000
Don't get me wrong.

968
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,880
I played Tetris effect cause I wasn't able to do last week's event cause I was

969
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,520
in Vegas.

970
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,400
I made sure to do the one this weekend and I finally, yeah, that's right.

971
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,480
They have events every Saturday.

972
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,600
So oops, you missed it.

973
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,240
Uh, but during that time you can play the 1989 skin too, which I think you

974
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,160
unlock at some point anyway, but you're able to play it during the weekend.

975
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
That 1989 skin is awesome.

976
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,560
The it's the old school, like Game Boy Tetris, but they, they kind of like the

977
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,200
song morphs as it does in other skins.

978
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,880
And so it's like the chip tune version at first.

979
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,320
And then it's just like totally like, like drum and bass, boom, boom, boom,

980
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,560
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

981
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,680
You know, like that whole thing.

982
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,240
And it's really cool.

983
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,800
And then we get to the end of the stage is like fireworks.

984
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,160
It looks really great in VR.

985
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,960
I loved it.

986
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,080
Um, so I've been playing a little bit of that, but I also went and I finally

987
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,480
played some rez in VR, which was great.

988
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,680
I played, finally got to play area X in VR, which is gorgeous.

989
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,200
And obviously the song is great.

990
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,720
It was a little short, but here, I'm going to tell you why area X bugs me

991
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:20,880
though.

992
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,360
Like I loved it.

993
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,840
Don't get me wrong, but didn't area X totally feel like a proof of concept

994
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,280
for like rez too.

995
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,000
Yeah.

996
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,200
Like what?

997
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,400
Cause the weird thing is when you launch area X, it takes forever to load

998
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,520
because it's its own game.

999
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,400
It's its own thing.

1000
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:36,560
Yeah.

1001
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,520
It's its own like separate thing.

1002
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,200
It's not, it's not like they built a new area in the first game's engine.

1003
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,360
They made a new engine out of unreal.

1004
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,640
If you read the credits, the unreal engine is credited.

1005
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,720
So they made a brand new engine for rez.

1006
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,320
They did that just for one area.

1007
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,560
I'm sorry, but that is a proof of concept of a new rez game that I am being

1008
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,360
denied right now.

1009
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,200
It's just like, you know, the home versions of DDR, where do you get the,

1010
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,840
you know, the preview songs for the next mix in there?

1011
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,360
They need to greenlight rez too.

1012
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,480
Cause that was awesome.

1013
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,760
I loved that playing.

1014
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,880
That was so cool.

1015
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,680
There's actually, did you, there's things that, that, in that, that kind of

1016
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,720
are in Tetris effect too.

1017
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,840
When you get enough of the powerups, your guy turns into the yoga kind of

1018
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,800
thing floating through.

1019
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,240
And that is the same thing you see in Tetris effect.

1020
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,800
When you're doing the relax modes, the little dude in the background does

1021
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,800
like the similar poses from rez area.

1022
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,480
I swear it's like the same thing.

1023
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,200
So I think, I think there are subtle connections between the enhanced games.

1024
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,560
I think Tetris effect is made in unreal as well.

1025
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,240
Oh, I, I'm sure it is.

1026
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,520
I'm sure a lot of the stuff.

1027
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,640
I wonder they credit an engine.

1028
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,680
They call it something like the Synthasia engine.

1029
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,680
I wonder Synthasia or something like that.

1030
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,280
I wonder if in the Tetris effects credits, that same engine isn't credited.

1031
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,280
I would bet Tetris and rez X are built on the same engine.

1032
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,000
Probably.

1033
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,800
I wonder if somebody in chat knows that over at live.vognetwork.com.

1034
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,000
Oh, Bobby Blackwell confirms that Tetris effect is made in unreal.

1035
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,960
So there is that.

1036
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,960
So I wonder if it is the same engine.

1037
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,000
So anyway, uh, I also played Thumper in VR, which that was that music game.

1038
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,560
That's really hard.

1039
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,240
They call it like the music horror game.

1040
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,080
And of course, obviously in VR, that's really cool.

1041
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,760
I had played that once before I think Shane or somebody had brought their VR

1042
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,040
over and I think I did play Thumper, but you know, I got to kind of sit down

1043
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,440
with it a little more and play that game is hard.

1044
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,120
I don't like calling that a music game because I flop that game so hard.

1045
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:27,760
It did.

1046
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,240
And I didn't get that yet, but I plan to, I just didn't get around to it this week.

1047
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,680
So, um, and I think, I think that's about it.

1048
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,080
Oh, I did a quick stream of Metroid, like 8-bit Metroid, because, um, if you set up

1049
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,600
a Japanese Switch account, which is very easy to do, you just do it online.

1050
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,760
You set your region in Japan, make a Japanese account.

1051
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,160
It's free.

1052
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,080
It doesn't cost anything you can go on.

1053
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,600
If you use that account on your Switch, you can go onto the Japanese store and

1054
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:58,240
you can download the Famicom game collection, which for the most part is

1055
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,720
not a big deal because it's the same games.

1056
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,080
It's not like the classic NES and the classic Famicom have like different games.

1057
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,280
It's not like that on Switch.

1058
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,600
It's all the same games, except I didn't even realize this Japanese got the SP

1059
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,960
golf, what, how many of you are really playing that golf game?

1060
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,440
Okay.

1061
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,360
So Japanese got the S special golf with everything unlocked, but here's the thing,

1062
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,800
because it is based off the Famicom stuff, Metroid was a disc game on the Famicom.

1063
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,200
So when you play Metroid on the Famicom version, you get the thing that looks

1064
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,720
like the Legend of Zelda, where you have your save files to select from.

1065
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,400
There's loading times between some of the different zones because it's emulating the

1066
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,560
disc, but also remember the Famicom had that extra sound chip thing.

1067
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,080
So there are some subtle noise and sound differences.

1068
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,800
Like the ice beam makes a very different sound.

1069
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,360
Those little birds that fly down from the ceiling to try to get you,

1070
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,280
they make a very, very different noise as well.

1071
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,600
So I actually did a live stream to just look at some of those,

1072
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,920
just those little, very, very subtle nuances.

1073
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,000
But I, those, that's the kind of shit I love.

1074
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,120
I love looking like at those subtle differences between what we got and what

1075
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,320
Japan got because back then the hardware was kind of different.

1076
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:02,560
Yeah.

1077
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,280
So, yeah.

1078
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,720
So I did a little stream of that and I got to do some classic 8-bit Metroid, so.

1079
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,400
Well, I was watching, I guess they did some, um, an AGDQ type like impromptu thing

1080
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,560
during some sort of, I don't even know what it was, but like recently.

1081
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,640
So I watched, they did, someone did a randomizer with the, the Zelda, um,

1082
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,880
Link to the Past, Super Metroid randomizer.

1083
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,960
But both games at once?

1084
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,200
Yeah.

1085
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:32,080
So what it does is, is, so the way it works is basically there's four points in, um,

1086
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,800
Super Metroid that link to, uh, Link to the Past.

1087
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,320
So you go between the games as, you know, the characters and the items from each are

1088
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,240
strewn about in the other games.

1089
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,360
Like all of, so they have some Link to the Past items that are in Link to the Past

1090
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,200
and some are in Super Metroid.

1091
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,960
That sounds like what the Nintendo player championships thing, you know,

1092
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,320
how like the cart would more like you, you get to a certain point rad racer and then

1093
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,160
you're playing Tetris and then you're collecting coins and Mario brothers and all that stuff.

1094
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
Like, remember how that cartridge would move between the games?

1095
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,720
That's kind of what it sounds like, but like cooler.

1096
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,000
Yeah, but yeah, this keeps going.

1097
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,360
Like, so they had, what they had is they had two speedrunners, um, doing it.

1098
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,160
One guy who was an expert at like Zelda and the other one was more of an expert at Link

1099
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,600
to the Past and they kept swapping.

1100
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,800
You mean Zelda Metroid?

1101
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,760
Yeah, sorry.

1102
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,920
Yeah.

1103
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,320
So they, they were kind of, uh, you know, better suited at each one.

1104
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,480
And so they were kind of doing that and like, you know, they'd find, oh, hey, here's the,

1105
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,440
you know, here's some arrows in Metroid and here's,

1106
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,000
you know, here's the various suit in Link to the Past.

1107
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,240
And it was neat.

1108
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:38,960
I don't know.

1109
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,840
It'd be fun to play.

1110
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,440
Yeah, I want to play that.

1111
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,240
Where's that ROM?

1112
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:42,880
I want to check that out.

1113
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,920
That sounds really cool.

1114
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,480
Yeah.

1115
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:44,720
All right.

1116
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,080
So that's it for our gaming weeks.

1117
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:50,560
So, um, housekeeping, I'll just say follow us on Twitter at twitter.com slash, uh, OLR.

1118
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,480
We're also on Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio and follow the network over at Twitch TV,

1119
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,400
VOG Network, all one word.

1120
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,560
We will not be using the Orange Lounge Radio channel.

1121
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,560
We're going to be kind of combining our forces all to one place, the VOG Network channel.

1122
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,200
I don't, I, I'm not going to say never say never to the Orange Lounge Radio Twitch channels.

1123
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,080
You can follow that too.

1124
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,200
But, uh, yeah, I'm going to be pointing people to the VOG Network channel.

1125
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,520
I know Bobby thinks y'all should wait, uh, to see some of the stuff he's got for the,

1126
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,920
the followers and all that stuff when we go live.

1127
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,000
But I want to get to that 50 follower account sooner rather than later.

1128
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,160
So there'll be hopefully more followers in the future too.

1129
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,280
So, so we'll see.

1130
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,880
But, uh, anyway, let's get to some other gaming news now.

1131
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,160
Um, again, this week we are going to cover kind of two weeks worth of news because the

1132
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,760
week the news was a little lighter this week with it being Thanksgiving and all that.

1133
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,320
So we are going to cover things from across both weeks as opposed to doing like a cramming

1134
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,400
last week's news all into a three minute segment.

1135
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,480
We're going to kind of just cause there's a big holidays, like these first couple of

1136
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,520
things that came up, there's some big things that happened while we were gone.

1137
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,000
We were gone.

1138
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,440
We need to get into, so let's get into it.

1139
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,240
Loki.

1140
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,280
So yeah, so yeah, like the last few steam sales, the steam link has been marked down

1141
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,160
quite a bit now.

1142
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,240
I think they were selling it for $2 and 50 cents.

1143
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:07,440
I've got mine either free or for a dollar, um, with a game at one point on here.

1144
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,320
But the reason why it's being marked down is because they are selling it out.

1145
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,680
They have declared that they're not making any more of the hardware.

1146
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,560
They're phasing it out so you can get your hands on a steam link, uh, cheap.

1147
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:25,040
And I think a steam controller as well, uh, while supplies last.

1148
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,280
Apparently the, it is sold out in Europe and almost sold out in the U S and once they're

1149
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,560
gone, uh, they plan on continuing support for the existing hardware, but they're not

1150
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,800
going to be, um, distributing any more of the standalone hardware.

1151
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,080
Instead, what they're going to be doing is using, um, smartphones, tablets and other

1152
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:50,560
Intellivisions to be able to use the steam app to do the steam link stuff, which makes

1153
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:58,560
sense because like, for example, my one streaming device I have, it has a steam link app in

1154
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,600
it so I can use that if I wanted to the stream games.

1155
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,600
Although I have a laptop, so it's kind of pointless, but I have it anyways, just in

1156
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,200
case I wanted to.

1157
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,760
Um, and my phone has that too.

1158
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,280
So I haven't actually tried that, but it'd be neat.

1159
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:13,600
Yeah.

1160
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,440
I bought a steam link and I bought them when they were still like probably $50.

1161
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,840
So I feel a little burned, but that's okay.

1162
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,560
I mean, you know, I got what I paid for and I did, I liked the controller a lot and I

1163
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,120
did like the device, but I can't really put my finger.

1164
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,440
And this is the question I'm going to ask kind of to everybody here.

1165
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,080
Like, I don't know.

1166
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,560
Well, part one, are you surprised by this news?

1167
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,060
No.

1168
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:33,840
Okay.

1169
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,560
Part two.

1170
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,120
Why then?

1171
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,480
What, why did steam link?

1172
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,200
Why didn't it, I guess, succeed?

1173
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,400
I'm not surprised because they dropped support for like steam boxes so quickly and it makes

1174
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,920
sense that they would have dropped support for this.

1175
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,480
You know, it's just hardware doesn't, this doesn't seem to be a thing that people

1176
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,320
necessarily need.

1177
00:49:54,320 --> 00:50:00,960
Like, you know, if you're going to be playing games on like a PC and stuff, most people

1178
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,120
are just hooking their PCs up to their TV or they're hooking their, they were just

1179
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,480
playing on their PC.

1180
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:13,680
There's not really a big demand for playing a PC game, you know, on your TV and streaming

1181
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,360
it over, you know, the wifi to play the same thing.

1182
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:18,960
I guess it makes sense.

1183
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,520
Like if you have like in an office or something like that, but it's just, I think people

1184
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,400
are just so comfortable.

1185
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,920
Like when you think about like someone's computer set up, like they have a nice keyboard,

1186
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,680
they have a nice mouse, they have a nice gaming chair, possibly that they're sitting

1187
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,640
in nice monitors.

1188
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,760
Why would I leave that to go somewhere else?

1189
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,400
Unless you do like trying to do like a party game or something like that.

1190
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,040
Yeah.

1191
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,600
Stream it over.

1192
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,760
It's just the use case is very limited.

1193
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,080
I think.

1194
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,360
I think that's kind of what it ended up being as much of like a neat piece of technology

1195
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,160
as it was.

1196
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,680
I think also it was kind of lacking in not, not everybody's going to agree with this,

1197
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:55,440
but I think they were really lacked in not having a Netflix app, a Hulu app, so it could

1198
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,200
compete on the level with like Roku boxes and stuff.

1199
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,720
So that way, if you were looking at Steam Link, it's like, oh, well, this one not only

1200
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,920
will do Netflix, Hulu, but this one will play all my PC games too.

1201
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,800
So this is the better value.

1202
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,360
Exactly.

1203
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:12,320
That would have been ideal, but it's like, it just like the whole Steam Box idea, it's

1204
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,080
kind of a half-baked idea and they just didn't really implement it too well.

1205
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,120
They kind of, they kind of stopped two thirds of the way, if you will.

1206
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,880
Looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com, VidPower says best thing about Steam Link is you can

1207
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,120
minimize it and use your PC on your TV.

1208
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,480
And Bobby Black Wolf says, yeah, I use Steam Link to watch streaming services that don't

1209
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,840
have a console app.

1210
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:36,160
Bobby Black Wolf also says, I think now they just want to get a Steam Link app on your

1211
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,640
Roku.

1212
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,920
And I think, I think he's right.

1213
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,040
I think that's where it's headed now because aren't there already televisions that have

1214
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,240
the Steam thing built in?

1215
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,520
Well, the Android TV has the Steam Link app.

1216
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,080
So I have that for my Android TV that I've got.

1217
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,240
I don't believe my Roku has a Steam Link app.

1218
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:52,480
Yeah.

1219
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,440
And just to be clear, like Bobby Black Wolf was saying, this is an example.

1220
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,080
The Steam wants to be, that is not, and just, yeah.

1221
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,920
Cause somebody in chat asked, oh, there's a Steam.

1222
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,960
No, not yet.

1223
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,720
But this is just kind of the progression.

1224
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:02,960
Yeah.

1225
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,360
Cause I think I would have looked at that.

1226
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,480
I would have put it on there if they had that, but no, they didn't have that.

1227
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,920
But hey, my TV that doesn't have, you know, Android TV that has a Steam Link app, I guess

1228
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,920
I could just hook my Steam Link up to that if I really wanted to.

1229
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,840
I don't though, cause I don't even know where it, no, I do know where it is.

1230
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,320
It's in the same place that my PlayStation TV is.

1231
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,480
You know what also ruined Steam Link for me?

1232
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:33,680
The game, the first game I tried to play on my TV was that Tron runner, Tron run R.

1233
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,480
That was the name of it.

1234
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,520
So you remember that game?

1235
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:35,760
Yeah.

1236
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,000
Okay.

1237
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,960
So the thing about that game level like four would freeze on my computer and I couldn't

1238
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,080
get past it because of some weird thing with my video card.

1239
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,080
So even when I was using the Steam Link, I could never get that part in the game.

1240
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,680
So it's like in my mind, you just kind of associate that mental thing.

1241
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:59,280
It's like, you know, if you, let's say eat at Taco Bell and it makes you really sick,

1242
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,320
you're probably not going to eat Taco Bell again for a long time.

1243
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:07,200
That's like the kind of response, the Pavlov's response that I got with my Steam Link is

1244
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,280
that Steam Link's just crashing my computer.

1245
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,920
Unless, you know, you do whether it's rational or not.

1246
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,800
That's what happened.

1247
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,360
I do where we haven't gone out to eat in a certain place in a long time.

1248
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,120
And so then we go back out there and we're like, oh yeah, that's why we don't come here

1249
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:21,680
anymore.

1250
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,640
And then you do that again a few years later because you forget why you stopped coming

1251
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,600
someplace.

1252
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,840
It's, yeah, I don't know.

1253
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:31,920
All right.

1254
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,800
So yeah.

1255
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,960
R.I.P. Steam Link, I guess.

1256
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,520
That's that.

1257
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,200
All right.

1258
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,320
Let's move on and talk about, this is, I think, kind of a big deal that came out the

1259
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,280
week we were off.

1260
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,840
And I was like, well, bummer we didn't have a show this weekend.

1261
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,120
So we'll talk about it now.

1262
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,720
I'm sure as many of you have heard by now, the announcement came out that Sony Interactive

1263
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,440
Entertainment will not be participating with E3 in the year 2019.

1264
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,000
So next year they will be skipping E3.

1265
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,120
In a statement that the company gave to Game Informer, they said, as the industry evolves,

1266
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,240
Sony Interactive Entertainment continues to look for inventive opportunities to engage

1267
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,040
the community.

1268
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,720
PlayStation fans mean the world to us, and we always want to innovate, think differently,

1269
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,960
and experiment with new ways to delight gamers.

1270
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,640
As a result, we have decided not to participate in E3 2019.

1271
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,680
We are exploring new and familiar ways to engage our community in 2019 and can't wait

1272
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,520
to share our plans with you.

1273
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,200
And so some people wondering, well, what does this mean for like, are they going to do what

1274
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,080
EA does?

1275
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:32,400
And EA doesn't participate in E3, but they're like across the street at the same time doing

1276
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,520
their own shit, right?

1277
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,000
Well, Sony clarified, Senior Vice President of Communications, Jennifer Clark said, we

1278
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,200
will not activate or hold a press conference around E3.

1279
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,320
So Sony, not going to be in LA in June.

1280
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,440
That was the perfect time to announce your next gen system, Microsoft.

1281
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,160
Which could very well happen.

1282
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:00,480
Just so you know, in a related story, I'm sure people were contacting right away, Nintendo

1283
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,960
and Microsoft were contacted right away about E3.

1284
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,160
Both have confirmed they will be at E3.

1285
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:12,480
Phil Spencer actually wrote a tweet, a lot to share with fans at E3 2019, always a high

1286
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,320
point of the year to witness the industry's creativity and the energy of the community.

1287
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:21,920
The official Xbox account saying, we can't wait to see you at E3 2019.

1288
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,320
Reggie Fils-Aime saying E3 is an outstanding opportunity for us to share new games and

1289
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,480
experiences with the fans and business partners from around the globe.

1290
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,160
And that's a statement that E3 actually put out.

1291
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,680
So those two companies will still be there.

1292
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:37,440
I think the thought, it seems like the general consensus is that Sony is just kind of resting

1293
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,120
high on their laurels and they're just like, yeah, we don't fucking need you guys.

1294
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,280
And so they're, I don't know if they have anything to show because I think it's more

1295
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,760
column B. I don't think it's necessarily Sony being crass, which is, you know, gamers

1296
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,840
oftentimes when a knee jerk reactor take it to a negative space because I think that's

1297
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:58,320
the reality is that Sony doesn't have anything they really, or, or the stuff they're going

1298
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,320
to show is the stuff they've already shown and they're going to get read for it because

1299
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,320
Last of Us 2 still isn't out.

1300
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,760
And I don't, have they dated that yet?

1301
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,240
This is probably next holiday.

1302
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,120
So yeah, Last of Us 2, they're still Death Stranding.

1303
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,120
Death Stranding is probably the next holiday.

1304
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,800
Zombie game that they're supposed to be coming.

1305
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,080
Days Gone or is that what it is?

1306
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,400
Days Gone.

1307
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,720
I think they did Days Gone finally because it got pushed back.

1308
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,520
The Samurai game that they had coming.

1309
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,760
So I kind of think if they were to have E3, they'd probably be rehashing a bit.

1310
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,320
I mean, maybe that Final Fantasy 7 remake someday.

1311
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,120
I don't know.

1312
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,840
So, uh, I think I can sort of see that maybe Sony's just like, you know, we don't have

1313
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,520
a lot to show this year because we're setting up for the next year.

1314
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,160
But there is that, I'm going to be honest.

1315
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,000
There's that cynical side of me as well too.

1316
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
That's like, I don't think it's so much Sony being on a high horse, but I seem to

1317
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,360
remember after we all remember the infamous E3 when the PlayStation 3 was unveiled.

1318
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,640
Giant enemy crabs, $599 US dollars, right?

1319
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,440
All those sound bites that came back to haunt Sony.

1320
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,720
I seem to remember Sony threatened to pull out that year too.

1321
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,160
They didn't, but they almost did.

1322
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:11,040
And I seem to recall this last year wasn't like superbly well received at the press

1323
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,320
conference at Sony.

1324
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:16,560
I mean, no, cause it wasn't, it wasn't like the games weren't like a problem or anything.

1325
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,600
I think people were generally excited about like Spider-Man stuff, but I think people

1326
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:24,560
were just like, Oh, why are we standing in this barn and then going to this thing?

1327
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,120
And it got like a lot of like crap online.

1328
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:34,480
And so I think honestly, somebody, honestly, Loki, you, me, Jamie, Bobby Black Wolf, we

1329
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,200
all sat down four years ago or so and kind of asked ourselves, is it really worth it

1330
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,720
for us to go to E3 anymore?

1331
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,880
Are we getting value out of E3 anymore?

1332
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,440
And honestly, somebody at Sony in a boardroom probably asked that same question.

1333
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,280
Like we paid all this money for this to get this online.

1334
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,480
Why are we doing E3?

1335
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,280
I think somebody asked that very hard question.

1336
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:01,760
But then again, like you're the one that made the choice to hold your little video

1337
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,560
thing in a barn with like a musical guest and stuff.

1338
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,360
And yes, I get it.

1339
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,000
The guy is like, he's good.

1340
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,880
He's a good musical guest, but is it really necessary to do that?

1341
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,640
Couldn't you just show a trailer and be done with it?

1342
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,200
I mean, like who, I don't know.

1343
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:17,920
I just think it.

1344
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,800
Let me get to some of the comments in our chat.

1345
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,880
Live.vognetwork.com.

1346
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,520
SSG100Matt says, I think Sony's recent moves decision not to do a PlayStation experience

1347
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:27,760
show.

1348
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,960
Remember, that's a thing too.

1349
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,640
And skipping E3 seemed to indicate that they're going to go all out in 2020.

1350
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,480
Sony cited that they don't have enough console exclusive and things in development not announced

1351
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,640
to warrant doing either show entirely.

1352
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,120
This leads me to believe they are going to rely on major game ports, the handful of games

1353
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,640
they are releasing in 2019, and even the PlayStation 1 classic.

1354
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,080
And let's not forget third party.

1355
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,720
Third party is hugely important in that too.

1356
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,080
That PlayStation 1 classic.

1357
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,640
I have very low expectations for that.

1358
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,140
Yeah.

1359
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:56,960
Let's see.

1360
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,720
Also, comments in chat.

1361
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,840
Yyr in chat says, remember the last one to two years of the 360.

1362
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,520
Microsoft had nothing.

1363
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,320
PlayStation 3 delivered and caught up.

1364
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,480
I wonder if the opposite might happen now.

1365
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,320
Slightly different dynamic.

1366
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,760
Yyr to PlayStation 3, and I'm using my quotey fingers, catching up.

1367
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,000
PlayStation always kind of had the advantage in Japan too, which Microsoft, even with the

1368
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,080
360, was never really able to do.

1369
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:27,200
And I don't really see them breaking through that Japan wall with Xbox One either.

1370
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:33,120
Potentially their next system, again, I think the biggest bombshell in the world would be

1371
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:38,240
Microsoft announcing they've acquired a Japanese studio amongst all these studio acquisitions

1372
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:38,880
they're doing.

1373
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,920
But we're all waiting on that.

1374
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,000
Maybe that'll be the bombshell they drop next E3.

1375
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,480
I don't know.

1376
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,760
I'm fan wanking.

1377
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,720
I'm making shit up.

1378
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:49,760
But I mean, that would really turn heads that if Microsoft is going to put some more focus

1379
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,720
back on Japan.

1380
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,520
But certainly Microsoft could certainly use this opportunity.

1381
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,480
Absolutely.

1382
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:02,880
But, you know, Sony is probably loading the guns with exclusives for the inevitable PlayStation

1383
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:03,440
5.

1384
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,880
That seems more and more likely for 2020 as whatever Microsoft is probably doing next

1385
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,160
is probably 2020 unless, I don't know, they did kind of tease it a little bit at this

1386
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:14,480
last year.

1387
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,920
Maybe they are going to do it in 2019.

1388
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,480
Maybe they're going to try to get a year jump on it like they did with the 360.

1389
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,080
They may not announce it at E3 because Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were not unveiled at

1390
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:24,480
E3.

1391
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,760
They were done at separate events.

1392
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,600
So who knows?

1393
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,560
So many things could happen.

1394
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:34,720
But what we do know, Microsoft is starting, they're moving the chess pieces, right?

1395
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,880
They have acquired all of these studios.

1396
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,600
Why?

1397
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,880
Exclusives.

1398
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,680
What?

1399
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,200
Next Xbox.

1400
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,040
So I fully expect that next Xbox gets announced.

1401
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:50,080
And I think probably in 2020 to give these games time to cook and so forth so that they

1402
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:54,240
can say we've got this exclusive, this exclusive, this exclusive, this exclusive.

1403
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,400
And don't worry, Crackdown is coming out in 2020 next year.

1404
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,560
Right around the corner.

1405
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,680
But Sony, I think, is in a position where they're positioning themselves for a similar

1406
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,160
thing.

1407
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,640
They're basically taking an entire year off and relying on third parties, relying on indies

1408
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:21,200
and that stuff so that they can also navigate and get lined up for 2020 and have this, this,

1409
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,480
and this ready to go in response to what Microsoft's going to do.

1410
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,640
2020 is going to be an exciting year.

1411
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:31,360
You know, honestly, in my opinion, Microsoft's not the one that stands to gain from this

1412
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:31,600
scenario.

1413
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,360
You know who's really going to gain from this scenario?

1414
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,520
Everybody's favorite number two, Nintendo.

1415
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:38,800
Nintendo.

1416
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,800
Nintendo is going to be clean, clean slate next year.

1417
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:46,400
They could, they're going to put out the new Animal Crossing game.

1418
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,280
Probably Metroid Prime 4 happens next year.

1419
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,280
If they wanted to redo the Switch and do a Super Switch or a Switch XL, whatever the

1420
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,440
fuck they want to do, next year's the year to do it.

1421
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,680
Like Nintendo has a clear path next year.

1422
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:03,360
It'll be very interesting to see what they do with it since they don't compete with Microsoft

1423
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,480
and Sony after all.

1424
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,320
So next year's all them.

1425
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,680
Well, I shouldn't say that because, you know, we will have Death Stranding.

1426
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,920
Last of Us 2, I'm sure is going to be amazing.

1427
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,840
Microsoft, it's not like they're taking the year off.

1428
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,640
They have their own stuff.

1429
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,800
Yeah, they don't compete unless they're winning.

1430
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,120
Yeah, that's like, that's like my kids.

1431
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:23,440
Like, well, I wasn't racing anyway, so it doesn't matter that I came in second.

1432
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:29,280
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure they're like, oh yeah, we're not competing with those guys when they're

1433
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,000
down in the numbers.

1434
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But then like, oh yeah, our console is the most number, you know, it sold the most units

1435
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,800
out of all of them.

1436
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,000
We're great.

1437
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,200
But we're not competing.

1438
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,440
YYR in chat says, yeah, Xbox One isn't catching all the way up, but they can build momentum

1439
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,560
for the next generation.

1440
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,600
I think that's a very interesting way to look at it, momentum.

1441
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,760
And I'll be very curious to see what Sony does to kind of bridge the gap.

1442
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,680
Are they going to go the Nintendo route and do more directs?

1443
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,120
Like, obviously, Sony doesn't do a direct, but you know what I mean?

1444
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:05,680
Like, you know, when they did their E3 thing this last time, they had the press

1445
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,880
conferences happening in the barn and that stadium thing.

1446
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,920
What did they fill in the interim with during E3?

1447
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,240
Their team that does all that, their blog cast people that do all the online content.

1448
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:20,480
So what's to say these guys don't put together little special TV shows and, you know, online

1449
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,080
TV shows and things that are akin to Nintendo's directs?

1450
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,840
And that's how Sony puts news out in the next year.

1451
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:29,620
Who knows?

1452
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,600
So we'll see.

1453
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,600
Next year is going to be very interesting for momentum.

1454
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:38,640
Let me ask one more question for everybody.

1455
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:44,080
Let's take the focus off Sony a little bit and let's put the focus on E3 itself.

1456
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,000
Is E3 dead?

1457
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,560
Does this just prove that E3 is dead?

1458
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,160
Yes or no?

1459
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,640
Support your E3 hasn't really necessarily been E3 for a few years now.

1460
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,280
So elaborate, please.

1461
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,520
It just kind of morphing into its own thing because, you know, this is like its final

1462
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,720
or one of the pieces to transition back into E4 all type of things.

1463
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,920
Oh, that's damn you.

1464
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,040
Because that's exactly where I was going.

1465
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:13,520
It's like now we're going to get the show that E4 all was supposed to be.

1466
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,960
E3 has been slowly morphing into the show that E4 all was supposed to be.

1467
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,640
But now no one's going to care because E4 all is just basically PAX, but PAX is better.

1468
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:28,720
So, you know, well, but is PAX better than what E3 is going to put out?

1469
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:32,080
Let's analyze that for a moment.

1470
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,920
If E3 now views its competition as PAX, which I'm not necessarily saying is true,

1471
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,480
I realize E3 is still a trade show.

1472
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,440
PAX is still a fan.

1473
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,480
She's got a Gamescom.

1474
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,960
But one of your biggest fucking trade companies just backed out of the show.

1475
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:50,800
So would E3 be smarter to reposition itself and embrace this fan thing

1476
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,440
more than they've already been doing in the past couple of years?

1477
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,560
You know, maybe E3 the trade show is is dying.

1478
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:02,400
We'll say that I won't say the finality of is dead, but is dying.

1479
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,760
E3 the fan show is growing.

1480
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,720
You know, obviously they're not going to bring that name E4 all back

1481
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,440
because everybody's going to associate that with a conference that didn't work.

1482
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:16,080
But I mean, a lot of those same kind of things that E4 all was going for.

1483
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,520
Isn't that kind of what E3 is like slowly turning into away from a trade show

1484
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,200
and competing with something like PAX?

1485
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,360
And I'm sorry, but PAX hasn't been good since 2010, in my opinion.

1486
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,960
So is it better than PAX?

1487
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,240
Maybe.

1488
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,960
I don't know, but I just I don't know.

1489
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:38,400
It's I don't have any like like I never feel like even nowadays, like,

1490
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,120
oh, man, I really wish I'd gone to E3 this year.

1491
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,560
I don't feel that at all anymore.

1492
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:49,360
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I like how video games are one of the only industries

1493
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,360
where the consumers won't allow an industry trade show to exist

1494
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,440
without them being a part of it.

1495
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,720
Do movies do this, too?

1496
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,440
Does movies?

1497
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,400
No, I guess.

1498
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,640
I mean, I feel like in a way, because all of it shows up on the Internet, but maybe not.

1499
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,760
Well, movies, I don't even know if they have really any trade shows, perhaps.

1500
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,480
Cinema West or whatever that thing's called.

1501
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,520
I don't where they show all the new trailers.

1502
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,120
It was in Vegas this past year.

1503
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,160
I feel like there's a couple.

1504
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,440
But yeah, I get I don't know.

1505
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,120
But like, I know there's like a lot of stuff takes place during like comic cons nowadays.

1506
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:19,680
It seems like.

1507
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,880
Vidpower in chat says, E3's brand name is still important,

1508
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,760
as non-gamers only know of E3 and probably don't know of other gaming conventions like PAX.

1509
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:31,680
Interesting.

1510
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,840
The name recognition.

1511
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:37,040
E3 is the type of thing that tends to get covered in newspapers

1512
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,400
on news channels for general people, not just necessarily a gamer audience.

1513
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:47,120
Dartitsuya in chat says, does D23 count?

1514
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,280
Though that's Disney exclusively, I think.

1515
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,840
Well, but think of all the things Disney's been snapping up lately.

1516
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,280
Disney's Marvel now.

1517
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,280
So that is included in D23.

1518
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,720
Disney Star Wars.

1519
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,760
The latest Star Wars trailers show up at D23.

1520
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,440
Disney is ABC.

1521
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:09,520
So yes, D23 is Disney, but Disney is much more than just cartoons and Disneyland at this point.

1522
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,200
Disney is a big empire.

1523
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:16,800
So Bobby Blackwell says, I think the thing that caused E3 to decline

1524
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,880
was making it not just a trade show.

1525
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:25,760
I think in a way, yes, but I think with virtual conferencing and virtual technology being

1526
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,600
bigger and bigger and the fact that we do get more of our stuff across the internet and that,

1527
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,080
you know, YouTube's deliver all the same information.

1528
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,760
We're doing conferences across video and working from home and all this stuff that

1529
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,480
we didn't do 10 years ago nearly as much.

1530
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,400
I kind of think that all plays into it.

1531
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,360
I think a lot of trade happens virtually.

1532
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,280
Like you just don't have to take a trip out to LA anymore to see stuff.

1533
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:47,920
That's the thing.

1534
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,800
Anyway.

1535
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,840
All right, let's move on or we can probably spend a whole three hours on this topic,

1536
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,120
but we do have other things we want to cover.

1537
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:55,920
So let's move on.

1538
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:56,420
Loki.

1539
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:02,400
So No Man's Sky rolled out with another patch over the last week here.

1540
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:08,640
So they have this new free patch called Visions and it added some new stuff to the game,

1541
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,200
including new biomes.

1542
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:18,320
It had some creatures in outer space, more palette variety in the planets.

1543
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,800
They had new fauna in the game.

1544
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,640
Lots of new tweaks that make kind of the game look better.

1545
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,040
New base parts.

1546
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,680
And I really need to go back to this game, but it's free and it's continuing to update,

1547
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,680
making the game even better than it was before,

1548
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,440
which we could say the same about Fallout 76,

1549
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,280
but maybe that will follow in the same path and, you know.

1550
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,240
You know what, despite-

1551
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,840
50 gigabyte update at a time.

1552
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:49,920
Despite all the shit that Hello Games has got over the years for No Man's Sky,

1553
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,040
like you got to hand it to them that they are still pouring in the effort

1554
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,760
to continue to improve and evolve this game.

1555
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,240
It's pretty bad.

1556
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,040
I feel less bad about them doing it because,

1557
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,480
or like the situation with them because they had a smaller team

1558
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,400
buying it, whereas Bethesda was like,

1559
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,720
you know, hey, we got our Fallout team and we got some mid team

1560
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,640
and we got these other guys doing it.

1561
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,920
We have these other guys doing it.

1562
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,560
We have all these people from Bethesda like putting it together.

1563
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,480
It's like, this is what you came up with.

1564
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,600
And I think I think you're right.

1565
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,960
A lot of people have said that some of these issues with No Man's Sky

1566
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,680
and what the internet made it out to be was that you had a,

1567
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:28,720
you know, indie developer being treated like a very ambitious idea,

1568
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:34,080
whereas multiplayer Fallout 4 recycled, not so ambitious.

1569
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:34,580
Yeah.

1570
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,960
But hey, check it out.

1571
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,280
It's free if you have the game.

1572
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,120
So why not?

1573
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:41,620
Why not?

1574
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:45,520
And I bet a lot of people probably pick that up on sale at some point or something.

1575
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,160
So, oh, yeah.

1576
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:46,660
Yes.

1577
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,560
They sell the fall sale and hey, tomorrow is Cyber Monday.

1578
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,120
Did you get suckered into buying anything from any of these Black Friday,

1579
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,440
Cyber Monday sales, Steam sales going on?

1580
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,640
Nintendo had a big sale.

1581
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,320
I was tempted to buy games on the Switch for my kids,

1582
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,360
but I can't really all of them were digital.

1583
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,640
So I don't really want to do that because I need to give it to them for Christmas.

1584
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,480
And I just haven't been able to order that stuff.

1585
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,760
I'm waiting till tomorrow.

1586
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,400
Let's see what I can pick up for them because they want to get like,

1587
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,480
you know, all the popular game.

1588
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:16,880
Oh, my God.

1589
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:21,120
So like speaking of sort of video games, I went and saw Wreck-It Ralph 2 this weekend.

1590
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:21,840
Oh, how was that?

1591
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,320
I want to go see it.

1592
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,200
It was fantastic.

1593
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,240
Oh, I can't wait.

1594
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:24,880
So it's great.

1595
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,640
They have a game in the you saw them trailer called Slaughter Race,

1596
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,760
which is basically Grand Theft Auto, which is fantastic.

1597
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:38,400
But there's like they're talking about like, you know, this YouTube type of thing,

1598
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,680
you know, that they're trying to get him lots of views and likes and stuff

1599
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:45,760
so that he gets money to order this part or whatever.

1600
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,160
And so they're talking about like the different things that are popular and stuff.

1601
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:53,360
And of course, there is like literally a two second clip of Fortnite

1602
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,480
and all the fucking kids in the entire theater, including my own son.

1603
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,240
It's like, oh, my God, Fortnite.

1604
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:01,920
You know, it's just it's like, oh, my God, did you say Fortnite?

1605
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:02,560
Oh, my God.

1606
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,440
And so it's the game of the week.

1607
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:10,480
But like so, yeah, he wants like stuff, you know, like they want to get Hello Neighbor,

1608
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:14,160
which is, you know, the popular like kind of, you know, not babies first,

1609
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,800
but kids first horror game.

1610
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,840
Babies first horror game.

1611
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,080
I thought it was like Five Nights at Freddy's

1612
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,440
because those games aren't really violent.

1613
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:25,920
That too.

1614
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,320
And like he's wanted me to give him Five Nights at Freddy's.

1615
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,240
And I'm like, you know, Custom Night's free.

1616
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:34,080
You just play that for free in Bendy and the Ink Machine.

1617
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:39,040
You know, it's also another horror game very much in the horror games.

1618
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,960
And of course, Roblox.

1619
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,840
He wants me to give him some like in-game currency for that game.

1620
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,480
Oh, boy.

1621
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,680
They have so much garbage on there.

1622
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,720
But oh, my God, it's all all the time.

1623
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:52,960
But yeah, my no, my youngest son, my like four year old wants Hello Neighbor.

1624
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,520
I don't even know that game.

1625
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:55,920
That's funny.

1626
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:56,640
Hello Neighbor.

1627
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,280
It's about I don't even know necessarily the premise of the game.

1628
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,640
I know that you basically break into this guy's house next door.

1629
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,600
And I think you should teach.

1630
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,760
And it's like this giant weird house.

1631
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,480
You just find out what's like going on over there.

1632
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,120
Like I don't know if he's murdering kids or something, but like something.

1633
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:11,440
What?

1634
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,480
Don't buy that for children.

1635
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,520
It's an E10 game.

1636
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,000
It's fine.

1637
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,920
It's he's probably not actually murdering kids.

1638
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,080
Or if it's, you know, it's not super violent.

1639
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,200
It's just ketchup.

1640
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,000
It's E10.

1641
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,120
But like apparently you're trying to like sneeze and he sets traps and stuff like that.

1642
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,520
And so I don't know what the premise is.

1643
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,880
It's just teaching you about burglarizing people's houses, I guess.

1644
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,520
Interesting.

1645
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:33,280
Yeah.

1646
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,880
So that and then they have like the Leo games.

1647
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,560
Sia Tabiri says kidnapping.

1648
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,720
Hello Neighbor is giant puzzle stealth.

1649
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,280
Bobby Black Wolf suggests Night Trap for babies.

1650
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,240
Night Trap for babies.

1651
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:45,600
Night twap.

1652
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:53,200
All right.

1653
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,040
I hate it.

1654
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:55,360
All right.

1655
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:55,920
Let's move on.

1656
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:01,120
So we were talking about big developers, big teams, developing things.

1657
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,680
Still chatter about Diablo and the mess that happened.

1658
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,160
Oh yeah.

1659
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,840
Oh, still angry.

1660
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,440
Still stuff about this.

1661
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,160
Not so much about Diablo Immortal at this point, but talk about people coming out of the woodwork.

1662
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,320
You know, anonymous tipsters and things like that.

1663
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:21,520
Talking about Diablo 4 that's been in development and what it is.

1664
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,600
And apparently part of the reason why they weren't ready to announce it yet is that the game has gone

1665
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,800
through some changes.

1666
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:32,080
Apparently the first version of Diablo, according to reports online, Kotaku did this whole,

1667
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,200
you know, expose on it.

1668
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,680
And I think other websites are kind of piggybacked on it.

1669
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,680
Apparently there was a Diablo project under work.

1670
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,800
It was called Hades.

1671
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:45,440
It was basically Blizzard's version of Dark Souls, but it was in the Diablo universe.

1672
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:51,280
It was a mainline Diablo project that was headed up by Josh Mosquera, who did Diablo 3

1673
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,920
Reaper of Souls, who has since left Blizzard.

1674
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,840
Although obviously they never talk about why.

1675
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,600
Did he do it to go do a new company?

1676
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,560
Did he do it because of this?

1677
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,280
I don't know.

1678
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,680
But anyway, it would have been, they say, a Gothic challenging dungeon crawler.

1679
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,000
It was Diablo's take on Dark Souls.

1680
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,080
Apparently this was going to be an over the shoulder third person perspective.

1681
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,360
They may not have ended up calling it Diablo 4.

1682
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,320
It was so different.

1683
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,880
But that's kind of where it started as.

1684
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:22,320
As a Diablo fan, I think this sounds terrible, but I bet my husband would be super into it

1685
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,840
because he loves Dark Souls and he also has played a lot of Diablo 3.

1686
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,840
So this is probably up his alley, but I'm all about loot, loot, loot, loot, loot.

1687
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,680
I don't care about like super hard mode, but that's what I, maybe it wasn't that.

1688
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:37,520
I mean, we hear Dark Souls and that's a certain type of, oh, you died, you died, you died.

1689
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,080
Right.

1690
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,880
And maybe Blizzard was not going to really do it that same way.

1691
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,600
What is it with Activision and trying to copy everybody?

1692
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,480
I mean, like I understand this is Blizzard, but it's still Activision.

1693
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:51,360
And it's like you have a game formula that Blizzard is fucking good at it.

1694
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,000
Look at what they did with Overwatch, Team Fortress 2.

1695
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:54,480
Look what they do.

1696
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,920
The Heroes of the Storm, League of Legends.

1697
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,960
Look what they did with that.

1698
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:57,920
They do it.

1699
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,840
They don't bring it to you every time, Loki.

1700
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,680
Yeah, but look what they did with Diablo.

1701
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,240
Diablo 3 is great now.

1702
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,320
Okay, but that's, that's a whole nother reason.

1703
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:16,080
That, that is a game made for China that should have never been on the main stage at Blizzcon.

1704
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,200
We talked about this a couple of weeks ago.

1705
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,160
It was the messaging.

1706
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:22,720
If the messaging had been different on that game, nobody would give a shit.

1707
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:27,280
The problem was it was the big announcement at a convention people paid $150 to go to.

1708
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,640
They should have kept it a sideshow and they should have let the Warcraft 3 remaster have

1709
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,280
the spotlight.

1710
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,360
It would have been fine.

1711
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,080
But anyway, we already talked about that.

1712
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,600
So, uh, let's see.

1713
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,080
Uh, this, uh, was canceled.

1714
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,720
Apparently there was also a planned second expansion for Diablo 3 that was canceled.

1715
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,920
And that pisses me off because that game deserved a second expansion.

1716
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:52,720
Uh, I would love to see what they, I feel like now, now the necromancer thing feels

1717
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:56,080
even more half-assed knowing that there was supposed to be a second expansion at some

1718
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:56,480
point.

1719
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,040
Well, that's okay.

1720
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,160
The second expansion will just be a part of like pre-ordered DLC.

1721
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,520
Well, there is no second expansion now.

1722
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,320
I mean, it'll be just rolled into whatever next game it is.

1723
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,040
Yeah.

1724
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:09,120
So anyway, apparently there is still a Diablo project that's in the works.

1725
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:13,040
It's being headed up by what's left of the Diablo 3 team, team three.

1726
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,920
Uh, and it's going to be another mainline entry in the series.

1727
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:20,800
Uh, but it's still very early on and even the camera perspective may still change to

1728
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,680
what they had on this, uh, project Hades.

1729
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,880
So, uh, Diablo 4 still a long ways out.

1730
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:33,840
And that is ultimately probably why Blizzard chose not to even show us a logo at this time

1731
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,400
and make the decisions they did.

1732
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,360
I would love to know why the second expansion got canceled.

1733
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,760
That's the, that's the answer I want.

1734
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,480
Why did Diablo 3 second expansion get canceled?

1735
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,920
And that's, that's not really me.

1736
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:50,400
Cause it sounds like people inside Blizzard were very surprised to hear it was canceled

1737
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,280
as well.

1738
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,280
So, interesting.

1739
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:59,680
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade at vognetwork.com,

1740
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,440
use the passphrase TWIG.

1741
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,760
Anyhow, let's move on.

1742
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,960
We have just a couple more stories before we get to the classic game of the week.

1743
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:07,760
Loki.

1744
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,560
So there's been rumors that there's going to be a new version of the Switch coming out

1745
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,760
at some point soon.

1746
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:20,480
And now that's kind of backed up a little bit by this consumer service video that Nintendo

1747
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:25,040
has put out called how to prepare a Nintendo Switch for trade in or sale.

1748
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:31,040
So basically telling you how you are supposed to like, you know, back up your data to the

1749
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:31,440
cloud.

1750
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:35,440
Of course, if you're a Switch online user and do a system transfer, link your accounts

1751
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:39,360
and then erase your data and then also unlink in your account.

1752
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,800
If you forget to delete anything before trading in.

1753
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,560
I'm sure they're going to say, well, it's because, you know, we're talking about, you

1754
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,520
know, trading in.

1755
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:56,080
If you want one of the Pikachu versions, the Diablo 3 Switch and their Smash Brothers one

1756
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,240
too, Smash Brothers or something like that.

1757
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,400
But like, I don't know.

1758
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,880
I don't see people doing that necessarily like they would.

1759
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,840
Oh, maybe Shane.

1760
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,840
But most people would not do that.

1761
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,880
It's a lot more money than like a 3DS, you know, or 2DS.

1762
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:11,520
Yeah.

1763
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,720
Or DS.

1764
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:15,440
Can't you just get stickers to put back on the existing Switch?

1765
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,080
You can.

1766
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,000
You can get like just skins and stuff.

1767
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:18,800
Who gives a shit?

1768
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,320
It's just a fucking skin.

1769
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,600
No one cares.

1770
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,800
It's a collectible.

1771
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:28,720
I mean, some people, my mother loved to collect these goblets from the Madonna Inn in San

1772
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,280
Elizabeth, the Madonna Inn with the themed rooms and all that stuff.

1773
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,680
For some reason, she loved these goblets.

1774
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:37,280
She collected the goblets and we just like, they're, they're, they're just drink cups.

1775
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,120
I mean, they're really pretty, but that's it.

1776
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:39,840
You know what?

1777
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,800
People collect things that they like collectors.

1778
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,560
But the thought more, you know, the thought process is, well, maybe it's getting ready

1779
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,120
for people to trade in their system for a newer Switch version or something.

1780
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:55,200
So maybe that's going to be a thing, but I guess we'll have to wait and see because they

1781
01:18:55,200 --> 01:19:00,080
haven't announced anything, but it seems to be, that's kind of the rumors kind of going

1782
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:00,480
that way.

1783
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,920
How would you feel if they did do a switch?

1784
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,240
I still feel like it's too early for one.

1785
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:08,160
I'm only going to support it if they don't start locking shit out like they did with

1786
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,200
the new 3DS.

1787
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,640
I'm going to be pissed if there's a Switch upgrade that suddenly starts locking things

1788
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,480
out because it's only been like two years.

1789
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:18,560
It's too soon for us to get a new console that's like, Oh, it's got all these exclusives

1790
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:18,800
on it.

1791
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,200
Don't worry.

1792
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,000
We're not going to do that.

1793
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,120
And then we do that, you know?

1794
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:21,440
Yeah.

1795
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:21,680
Right.

1796
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:22,960
That's what I'm.

1797
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,280
I just don't understand what they, what they would be.

1798
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,880
I mean, I guess upgrade the screen.

1799
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,000
The screen's fine.

1800
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
It looks nice on the 720 screen.

1801
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,640
I mean, I don't think we really need to increase the resolution or anything.

1802
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,360
Battery life.

1803
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,720
Is that an issue?

1804
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:41,920
More power, more graphical oomph, more chips, more rams, more memories, more on board storage.

1805
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,240
That would be nice because 32 gigs is ridiculous.

1806
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,800
But I don't really see, I don't know.

1807
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,160
I don't think it's necessary.

1808
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:51,600
Well, we'll see.

1809
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,360
Nintendo's just got to tell us.

1810
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,120
I would like another switch just so I have one that the kids don't fuck up.

1811
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:02,480
I forgot to mention, so here's what I do now because they have fucked up, you know, my

1812
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,400
red and blue, um, joy con.

1813
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,600
So I have a set of, you know, uh, Splatoon ones.

1814
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,760
I have the green and purple or not green, purple, green and pink.

1815
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,680
And so I have those sitting, um, charging all the time.

1816
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:19,680
And then when I go and play the system, I just take the crappy joy cons off and I put

1817
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:24,160
the nice untouched joy cons on there and I play my games with that.

1818
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:28,400
And then of course it put the crappy ones back on when the kids play it because I don't

1819
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,840
know what the fuck they did to that analog sick, but it's fucked.

1820
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:37,600
It is all sorts of like, I don't know, maybe if there's like crap or like dust or something

1821
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,480
underneath it, but it drifts like I tried fixing that thing, but it's drifting all over

1822
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,200
the fucking place.

1823
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,520
They threw it in the bathtub when you weren't looking and throw it in the bathtub.

1824
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:50,880
But it's, I, I think if it's, I think it may be dust, but I don't understand how that

1825
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,560
thing would be affected by dust so quickly.

1826
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,000
We've only had it since April.

1827
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,560
I mean, it's not been that long and it's only the left sick for some reason.

1828
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:02,800
And I've tried like cleaning it out, like blowing children a blessing.

1829
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,240
I don't even know if it's children.

1830
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,520
It's, I've seen people complain online that these things break pretty fast.

1831
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:07,840
Oh yeah.

1832
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,480
Dark to see in chat says my joy con is doing that too.

1833
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:14,800
So it's just some shit on however they design it, you know, cheaply or whatever.

1834
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:15,600
So I don't know.

1835
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:16,480
All right.

1836
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:16,880
We'll see.

1837
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:17,760
All right.

1838
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,520
Well, before we get to the classic game of the week, uh, one way that, uh, you know,

1839
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,840
people are getting in trouble for getting their classic games out is by running ROM

1840
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,640
websites.

1841
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:32,160
And, uh, yeah, while we were out, uh, you may remember Nintendo had filed actual lawsuits

1842
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,840
against the websites, love ROMs and love retro.

1843
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:41,040
Well, apparently they've reached an agreement and there is a $12 million judgment.

1844
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,880
Love ROM and love retro will be paying Nintendo a $12 million judgment.

1845
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,040
How do you, how do you, how do they have $12 million?

1846
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,520
Does that just mean like their paychecks are going to be garnished for the rest of their

1847
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:49,760
lives?

1848
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,680
Cause where are they going to come up with $12 million?

1849
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,480
Like where, where do you like Loki?

1850
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,760
If you got sued for $12 million, how would you pay bankruptcy?

1851
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,440
I guess maybe that's what they plan to do.

1852
01:21:59,440 --> 01:21:59,840
I don't know.

1853
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:04,080
I mean, you hopefully, hopefully if they're running your website like that, they had it

1854
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:09,920
running under a LLC or something like that so that they're not liable for damages.

1855
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:13,840
I don't think so because the defendants in this admit that their involvement with the

1856
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:18,800
websites constituted direct and indirect copyright and trademark infringement, which caused Nintendo

1857
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:23,440
irreparable injury plaintiff is hereby awarded judgment against all defendants jointly and

1858
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:27,120
severally in the amount of $12 million, $230,000.

1859
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:27,600
I am sorry.

1860
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,720
It's actually 12.2 million.

1861
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:36,320
Oh, speaking of lawsuits, I got my $10 check from the whole PlayStation three, um, other

1862
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,520
OS lawsuit.

1863
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,080
Oh, nice.

1864
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:38,560
Yeah.

1865
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:39,200
Oh, cool.

1866
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:39,520
Yeah.

1867
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,800
I forgot that was even coming.

1868
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,080
I ain't even like Merry Christmas.

1869
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:44,320
Yeah.

1870
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,680
It's like $10.

1871
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,200
I'll spend this in one place.

1872
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,760
Also interesting.

1873
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:55,200
They were required to sign over the ownership of love ROMs and love retro to Nintendo.

1874
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,320
So wouldn't that be hilarious if Nintendo started using the love retro name?

1875
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,360
We own this now.

1876
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:06,000
Please give it up for our love retro collection coming up.

1877
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,600
That would be such an asshole thing to do, but I could see it happening.

1878
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,160
That's great.

1879
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,520
That is a pretty good name to have love retro.

1880
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:14,240
So who knows?

1881
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,800
Just have love retro.com.

1882
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,360
Redirect to a website on switch online.

1883
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:23,360
Piracy is bad and stuff like that, but $12 million damage, please.

1884
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,440
I think that's a bit much.

1885
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:26,800
All right.

1886
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:33,120
Also, Hey, if you are downloading ROMs, especially of the new stuff, be careful because, uh,

1887
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,640
Pokemon let's go.

1888
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:38,400
I mean, there is a ROM out there floating around on the internet, but, uh, there's a

1889
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:43,520
fake one, a Pokemon let's go Pikachu ROM that will brick your console.

1890
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:48,000
If you try to use it, it is a more sinister version of the game, which you shouldn't be

1891
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,840
pirating the new stuff anyway.

1892
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,800
So, you know, I probably really shouldn't even say this, but it is interesting that

1893
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,080
people are kind of coming up with these kind of countermeasures to some of the pirates.

1894
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:03,440
So Pokemon let's go Pikachu uses brick break and it was very, very effective.

1895
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:10,880
I can make those Pokemon now because I played the game.

1896
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:12,880
I'm aware of all this stuff.

1897
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:21,440
Let's go back to a more classic time when the, the Pokemon that we sought out was missing.

1898
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,960
No, we're going to take a step back with the classic game of the week.

1899
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:32,480
And so as usual, we take a trip down memory lane and through radio magic and the use of

1900
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:36,560
Skype to say hello to dark Sakura or Jamie Summers with us on the line.

1901
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,280
Hello, Jamie.

1902
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,120
Hello.

1903
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,080
How are you doing?

1904
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,400
I am okay.

1905
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,120
How are you?

1906
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:43,440
Good.

1907
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,360
I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving.

1908
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,360
It was pretty good.

1909
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,480
It was nice and chill, which is what I was hoping for.

1910
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:50,720
All right.

1911
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:53,520
But literally chill because you guys are up in Tahoe, right?

1912
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,320
Yes, it was snowing.

1913
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:01,120
There was snow on the beach, which was actually kind of weird for me, but very cool.

1914
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,720
Snow in California.

1915
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:03,840
Get out.

1916
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,560
We have high elevation here.

1917
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:06,880
It does.

1918
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,320
It has been known to happen anyway.

1919
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,800
It's the classic game of the week time.

1920
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:16,080
Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and says, Hey, this game, you should

1921
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,120
be thankful for this.

1922
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:23,280
Dark Sakura picked a, this is an interesting one because it's like, it's a modern take

1923
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:28,480
on a classic game, but it does qualify under the 10 years or older criteria, believe it

1924
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,040
or not, right?

1925
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,880
That it does.

1926
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,760
Cause it came out in September of 2008.

1927
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:34,160
There it is.

1928
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:37,280
So it's a, this is one of those feel old yet type of games.

1929
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,800
Cause it is 10 years old this year.

1930
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,000
What is the classic game of the week?

1931
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,080
Mega Man nine.

1932
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:48,800
Mega Man nine.

1933
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:54,080
They were using chip tunes and Mega Man nine, but this was on the 360 and the Wii.

1934
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:55,920
Yep.

1935
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,200
There's more to this.

1936
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:57,920
Okay.

1937
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:08,960
So, um, it was developed by Capcom and NTCreates and it is the first original Mega Man series

1938
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:14,960
game since Mega Man eight and Mega Man and base or Rockman and Forte, uh, that came out

1939
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,400
about a decade before this one.

1940
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:23,840
Um, it is also the first game in the series to not have a truly physical first release.

1941
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:31,360
Um, it was downloadable using, uh, WiiWare and PlayStation network and Xbox five arcade.

1942
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:39,600
It was now since 2017 that it would have a physical release with the release of Mega

1943
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,880
Man legacy, legacy collection two for PS4, Xbox one and PC and the digital version that

1944
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,400
came out on the switch in 2018 in may.

1945
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:54,480
So basically it continues the adventures of, uh, Mega Man or Rockman.

1946
01:26:55,120 --> 01:27:00,720
And so Dr. Light is blamed for Dr. Wily's, uh, evil.

1947
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:09,360
And so Mega Man goes into stop the robots to prove his creator's innocence and to show

1948
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,760
that it's Wily who's a bad guy.

1949
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:16,240
So it is old school 2D platforming Mega Man action.

1950
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:24,880
Um, it was developed for modern console, but was required to go in an 8-bit and a visual

1951
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:30,320
and audio style like the NES, uh, Inafune Kenji, uh, Keiji, sorry.

1952
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:36,880
And, um, Takeshita, um, Hironobu who were the development team, um, you know, behind

1953
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:42,320
those, uh, well, they were the producers, but they instructed the development team to

1954
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,760
stick to the likeness and style of Mega Man 2.

1955
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:53,040
Which came on 1988 and it was a pretty big success and it prompted them to also come

1956
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,440
out with Mega Man 10, uh, soon after.

1957
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:01,760
So this was also something that took place in year 20XX.

1958
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:08,480
And it is also the first game that create, that had a female robot master.

1959
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,880
This was the game that Flash Woman showed up in.

1960
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:17,440
Um, and of course in the robot order that you're supposed to fight in, you know, the

1961
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,320
advised robot order, he's the first on the list.

1962
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,480
So guess who happened to see them?

1963
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:23,120
It's versatile.

1964
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:34,960
Um, as I was saying, it did follow the style visually and audio for, um, Mega Man 2, um,

1965
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,960
that was used as the benchmark for it.

1966
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:42,240
It also did have downloadable content for the game that one of them would allow you

1967
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:47,280
to play as Proto Man, which he can slide, charge his blaster and take double the damage

1968
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,160
of Mega Man.

1969
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:56,320
Um, you also could get higher difficulty and endless stage and, um, a new special box called

1970
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:56,880
Fake Man.

1971
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:05,760
So, um, in, uh, the later release came out in Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, instead of

1972
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,720
it being DLC, you had secret codes that will allow you to unlock the DLC content.

1973
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,920
Um, uh, as I said, it was developed by Capcom and Inti Creates.

1974
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:25,200
Inti Creates had developed, uh, Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX, um, spin-offs and had previous

1975
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,480
Capcom team members who had worked on other Mega Man games.

1976
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:34,800
Um, the first, uh, six games in the original Mega Man series were made for NES.

1977
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:41,120
There were a bunch of spin-offs, of course, like Mega Man 8, and then the Mega Man, uh,

1978
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:46,480
8 and Rockman 4K were, uh, brought out on other home consoles later.

1979
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:54,240
But, you know, Hunie, um, was, of course, um, down to create, you know, something that

1980
01:29:54,240 --> 01:30:00,320
was a throwback to the superior old school, but that its creation would highly depend

1981
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,640
on the input of fans, and that was a quote from him.

1982
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:08,240
Um, he said that the simple fun of a Mega Man game does not fit into the grandiose,

1983
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:11,360
expansive world of the consumer gaming industry has become.

1984
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:14,560
She has to make games that match the current expectations.

1985
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:18,560
And so he really wanted to go back to how it was supposed to be.

1986
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:24,160
And the rise of retro gaming, especially on services like Virtual Console, basically

1987
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:25,920
made Mega Man 9 possible.

1988
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,280
People wanted the old school.

1989
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:35,840
Um, the audio was, uh, composed by Yamada Ippo, um, uh, Kawakami Ryo, uh, Shimodo Yu,

1990
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:38,400
and Isogai, um, Hiroki.

1991
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:45,600
Um, they were all people who had, um, big input, and some of them were actually veteran

1992
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,200
composers like Yamada.

1993
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:52,320
Um, he had been a composer for Capcom and worked with what he called a series of a sense

1994
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,120
of nostalgia.

1995
01:30:54,080 --> 01:31:01,440
And that, um, Shimodo Yu actually analyzed the audio of the NES Mega Man games so that

1996
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,440
he could be as authentic to it as possible.

1997
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:08,400
Um, as I said, it came out in 2008.

1998
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:14,240
It was fully announced as Mega Man 9 in July 2008, and the details were announced in a

1999
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:17,440
Weekly Hamitsu and Nintendo Power.

2000
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:25,520
Um, it was supposed to be exclusive to WiiWare, but there, of course, you know, after, you

2001
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:31,200
know, prompting from the fans, they, uh, brought out Xbox Live Arcade and PSN copies.

2002
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:40,240
Um, there also were, um, mobile phone incarnations that were released in Japan in late 2010.

2003
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:48,000
Uh, promotional artwork for it was done by I Am 8-Bit that was supposed to be reminiscent

2004
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:56,640
of the really bad art we got here in the US, so the marketing campaign was meant to reflect

2005
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:57,140
that.

2006
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:06,800
And, um, it also was put out with, uh, you know, uh, you could get, like, a custom box

2007
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,400
that had that artwork on it and everything.

2008
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,160
It was pretty, pretty crazy.

2009
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:14,800
And then they did, um, for other promotional stuff, there was the Ski Tank energy drinks

2010
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:20,400
into CD soundtracks, and that came out also in September 2008.

2011
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,160
It was pretty well received.

2012
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,440
Everyone was super happy.

2013
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:31,520
Um, they did not release the financial figures, but said that they were cautiously optimistic

2014
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:37,520
about its performance on WiiWare and on the other, uh, consoles, and actually, it got

2015
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:45,840
pretty decent ratings, um, except by, like, one UK group called OPM, but they don't count.

2016
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,720
Who cares what they think?

2017
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:55,120
There was an arcade comics, um, series, and, um, the series would go on hiatus before it

2018
01:32:55,120 --> 01:33:00,880
could do the full storyline, but they did release Splash Woman and Concrete Man early,

2019
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,600
um, in the, the series.

2020
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:10,480
And then there was, uh, um, another new character in the series called Vesper Woman, um, but

2021
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,200
I don't recall if she ever made it into one of the games.

2022
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:14,960
And that was it.

2023
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,400
That's Mega Man 9.

2024
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,120
You know, it's interesting that you say the Splash Woman is the one that you're supposed

2025
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:22,240
to fight first, because I noticed in this, um, long play that we're using to get the

2026
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:25,440
background music, they also took on Splash Woman first, which you might have heard the

2027
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:29,360
background music there, but I, I think this is one of those games where there's kind of

2028
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:33,200
multiple paths through, because I seem to remember Galaxy Man was the one that I was

2029
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,320
told to start with.

2030
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,480
Not Splash Woman, that was towards the end.

2031
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:42,400
But, you know, in Mega Man 2, I know some people would start with Metal Man, some people

2032
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:46,880
would start with Flash Man, so it's probably one of those games where there's, you know,

2033
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,240
multiple ways through it, just depending on who you're com- there's probably a certain

2034
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:53,920
loop through it, but it's all about who are you most comfortable taking on with just the

2035
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:54,800
arm cannon, you know?

2036
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,480
Well, it's who has the biggest weakness to who.

2037
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,720
I always did start with Mega Man first, because his weapon was much versatile.

2038
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,480
You mean, you mean Metal Man?

2039
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,240
Metal Man, yeah, sorry, I started with Metal Man first.

2040
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:08,800
Yeah.

2041
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,840
Because he was in, and 2, because he was the most versatile.

2042
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,360
But, like, everyone's got their own weakness, like, Splash Woman's primary weakness is the

2043
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,120
Hornet Chaser from Hornet Man.

2044
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:19,620
Yeah.

2045
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:28,000
Concrete Man's weakness is the Laser Trident, and he said Splash Woman is also secondarily

2046
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,680
weak to the Mega Buster.

2047
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:30,480
Oh, interesting.

2048
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:38,240
Whereas other ones are not necessarily weak to those other- to the Mega Buster, although

2049
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:38,800
it will work.

2050
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:44,160
Interesting, yeah, no, I swear there was a path in 2 where you can start with Metal Man,

2051
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:47,440
was kind of a common one, but you could do Flash Man, then you go Flash Man to Quick

2052
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,920
Man, and you use the time stopper on Quick Man, and it saps like a third of his health,

2053
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:55,280
but that means you have to kill the rest of them with the Buster, it's not quite as easy.

2054
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,360
But once you kind of get past that, the rest of it's keg.

2055
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:05,200
Well, I always did Quick Man pretty much last, because I would, um, I never liked his stage,

2056
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:05,840
first of all.

2057
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:06,240
Yeah.

2058
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,440
I wasn't very good at it.

2059
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:15,040
There were some that would tell you to start off with, you know, Air Man, which I was like,

2060
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:15,540
why?

2061
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:20,480
But my- my first three, I would always do Metal Man first, and then I would switch between

2062
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,320
either doing Flash Man or Crash Man first.

2063
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,640
Yeah, I like the ones that have a little more versatility.

2064
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:29,040
So anyway, I didn't mean to make a Mega Man 9 discussion about Mega Man 2, but, I mean,

2065
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:29,600
since-

2066
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,600
But it wasn't put after it, you know?

2067
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:37,360
Yeah, this game was meant to evoke the feeling of, you know, when Mega Man was at its, you

2068
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:41,920
know, peak for most people, which was arguably Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3, I think a lot-

2069
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:46,400
I mean, you're gonna get some Mega Man fans that are like, but I love 5, 4 is the best,

2070
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:50,880
you know, and that's- that's fine, but I think generally, it was probably at its peak with

2071
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,520
Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3, for most people.

2072
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:54,080
Yeah.

2073
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:54,580
Yeah.

2074
01:35:55,120 --> 01:36:02,720
Mega Man 2, just, I don't want to miss with people I know, is, I would say, fairly considered

2075
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:06,720
to be the pinnacle of the series, and the rest were all really good, but Mega Man 2

2076
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:09,680
is usually when people have the biggest fond memories of.

2077
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:13,840
Yeah, and then there's so much of two in three, because you go back and you fight all the

2078
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:18,240
two bosses in three, that like, it's hard to ignore that three in some ways feels like

2079
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:22,160
the superior game, but I'm not gonna start that argument, that's probably already going

2080
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:24,800
in our chat room, but anyway, we got to get back to the show.

2081
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:30,480
But there it is, your classic game of the week, Mega Man 9, which believe it or not,

2082
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:35,280
is 10 years old, even though it feels a lot older, but maybe some people experiencing

2083
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:41,360
it relatively recently due to the Mega Man collection part 2 that had like 7, 8, 9, and

2084
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,880
10 all in one collection.

2085
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,360
I know some people get into it that way.

2086
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:50,320
So anyway, Dark Sakura, we look forward to having you back in studio soon, and hopefully

2087
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:54,240
before the year is out, and we might be on our Twitch thing.

2088
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:58,480
I think we only got about one or two more Shoutcast shows in us, then we're gonna make

2089
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,080
that big transition, so it's gonna be fun.

2090
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:06,800
We'll see what happens, but yeah, for now though, I mean, I have to save up some time

2091
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,240
off and see if I can.

2092
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:13,040
All right, well, glad you had a good Thanksgiving, Dark Sakura, and we'll talk to you next time.

2093
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:17,040
Any parting words for our listeners tonight before we go back to the live show?

2094
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:19,600
Coffee is wonderful.

2095
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:27,040
Coffee is wonderful.

2096
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,560
I just had a cup before the show.

2097
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:33,120
Hey, we're back live with Orange Launch Radio continuing on here.

2098
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:37,520
Episode number 753 for this November the 25th of 2018.

2099
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,560
Loki joining me here in studio, of course.

2100
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:41,360
Hello, Loki.

2101
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:41,760
Hello.

2102
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:42,480
What were you doing?

2103
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,080
Were you playing a game over there during the break?

2104
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,000
I thought you were Pokemon going, weren't you?

2105
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,680
I was doing Pokemon Go stuff, and then I was putting my calories for today.

2106
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:50,320
Oh, okay.

2107
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:50,880
Well, that's good.

2108
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,280
You still do really good on all that health stuff.

2109
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:53,760
Good for you.

2110
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:58,560
Yeah, this weekend I haven't really been paying attention to my diet too much, but I haven't

2111
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,800
gained anything, so it's been fine.

2112
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:01,600
It's Thanksgiving.

2113
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,160
It doesn't count.

2114
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:06,320
Well, last week it was all kind of screwy anyways because it was raining and because

2115
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:11,360
I had fucked up my foot earlier in the week, so I tried walking on it, and that only screwed

2116
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:16,800
up the side of my calf instead because I was kind of walking on the outside of my foot,

2117
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:21,280
and even though the bottom of my foot wasn't hurting as much anymore, the side of my foot

2118
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:25,760
was just like that muscle just got tensed up and winged.

2119
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:27,280
Getting old sucks, huh?

2120
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,160
I guess, yeah.

2121
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:34,560
So I was hobbling around with that, but hopefully I feel fine enough to play DDR again this

2122
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:35,680
week, so I'm going to do that.

2123
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:36,400
I hope so.

2124
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:36,640
Yeah.

2125
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:37,040
I hope so.

2126
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,000
I want to come over and play...

2127
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,640
Oh, Nick, please, not so quick and do it all night.

2128
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:42,720
Yeah, we need to pick a day or something.

2129
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,880
Maybe the weekend or something.

2130
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:45,440
We'll make that work.

2131
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:51,120
Well, also joining us virtually via Skype, we're welcoming an old friend back to the

2132
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:55,200
show here who is celebrating a classic game of his own a little bit this week.

2133
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,200
Hey, YYR, are you there on the line with us?

2134
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,920
Oh, Nick, please, not so quick.

2135
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:00,480
Oh, my favorite.

2136
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,600
That song is my jam.

2137
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,520
That was the song that really made me fall in love with DDR.

2138
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,320
This song is so over the top.

2139
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:08,000
It's pretty ridiculous.

2140
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,560
It's ridiculous, yeah, as video games should be.

2141
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,080
Video games should be over the top ridiculous.

2142
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:12,720
Those are my favorites.

2143
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:13,360
A little bit.

2144
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:14,560
How are you doing, YYR?

2145
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:18,320
I'm actually doing pretty well.

2146
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:22,480
Yeah, I actually was just playing In the Groove earlier and I passed Hardcore of the North,

2147
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:28,480
which was ridiculous because that has more steps than any other In the Groove single

2148
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,240
expert official chart.

2149
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:31,440
So that was cool.

2150
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,240
I was not aware.

2151
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:37,040
I really would love to play Kyle's new Step Maniacs game at some point, though.

2152
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:40,960
I think it's doing really well overseas, like in Germany.

2153
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:44,640
I keep seeing on his Facebook, I sold another 5,000 machines in Germany.

2154
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:45,520
I'm making these numbers up.

2155
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,160
But you know, it's like his game is huge in Germany.

2156
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:50,640
He's like, he made the David Hasselhoff of video games.

2157
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,280
Well, I'll say this much.

2158
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:56,320
We do have a machine in New Jersey at 8 on the break.

2159
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:56,960
Of course.

2160
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,200
And I have gotten to play on it.

2161
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:03,520
And I mean, if you like to play double, it's lacking in content right now.

2162
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:08,000
But in every other respect, it feels very polished, very fun to play.

2163
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:13,520
And I apologize for any baby screaming in the background because she's very excited

2164
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:13,920
right now.

2165
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:15,360
Don't apologize for that.

2166
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,800
And 8 on the break.

2167
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,160
I've been there.

2168
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:19,200
It was many years ago.

2169
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,480
It was many, many years ago.

2170
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:23,920
But my favorite arcade in New Jersey, the only one I've been to.

2171
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:24,640
I'll say that.

2172
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:25,040
Free plug.

2173
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:26,400
Not much has changed either.

2174
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:29,440
They still have delicious break steaks at the bar.

2175
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:35,680
And yeah, classic games all over the place and a lot of music games.

2176
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:40,320
Well, speaking of classic games, YYR, you're kind of calling in a bit tonight because you're

2177
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,840
celebrating an anniversary.

2178
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,360
Obviously, you've been celebrating a lot of new changes in your life with your new child

2179
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:48,880
and all, but you're kind of celebrating a big birthday as well, right?

2180
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,960
Yeah, something like that.

2181
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,240
So on November 20th, 2008.

2182
01:40:55,120 --> 01:41:00,480
Actually, I think it was November 19th that this thing launched the Xbox Live Community

2183
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:04,880
Games, which then was later renamed to Xbox Live Indie Games.

2184
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:08,400
And then on November 20th, Snake 360 came out.

2185
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:11,280
So yeah, it's been 10 years.

2186
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:14,560
So are you here to lobby for Snake 360 to be a Classic Game of the Week?

2187
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,000
Because I don't think January would wear.

2188
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:16,320
I don't know.

2189
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:16,720
We'll see.

2190
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:17,120
We'll see.

2191
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:18,720
I don't know about that.

2192
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:25,120
That's, that would be, you know, pretty epic to make it onto Orange Lounge Radio Classic

2193
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:25,840
Game of the Week.

2194
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:33,280
But, you know, I'm not going to have any delusions of grandeur, but no, it's Switch version when

2195
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,000
I see in chat.

2196
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,040
Thanks, Dr. Tetsuya.

2197
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:40,400
That's when you know you've made it because everybody will ask on your AMA on Reddit.

2198
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,560
Switch version when it's for begging.

2199
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:46,240
If you get Switch port begging you, you may in fact have made it.

2200
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:47,920
Yes, absolutely.

2201
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,280
Well, 10 years later.

2202
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:54,160
So I mean, I guess the kind of sad thing is obviously the Xbox Indie Games as we know

2203
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:58,160
it from before no longer exists, but they kind of they kind of brought it back in a

2204
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,040
different form, right?

2205
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:04,480
So it's called the Xbox Live Creators Program.

2206
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:12,880
And if you go, if you have an Xbox One and you go to the store underneath all of the,

2207
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:16,080
you know, sale, boom, AAA stuff.

2208
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:19,600
Yeah, you're going to find this little tab that says Creators Collection.

2209
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:23,600
And if you go in there, you're going to find this, you know, little sectioned off, kind

2210
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,440
of like Xbox Live Indie Games was.

2211
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:31,360
But nonetheless, you're going to find a bunch of stuff in there that is not rated by the

2212
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:38,720
ESRB and does not have achievements or online play, but otherwise, you know, is put together

2213
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:43,280
by, you know, hobbyists or, you know, people that couldn't get approved for the independent

2214
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:44,240
developer program.

2215
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:50,720
Just, you know, some fun stuff that was approved by Microsoft for release and that you can

2216
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:53,120
buy just like Xbox Live Indie Games.

2217
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,200
But unfortunately, the Xbox Live Indie Games didn't cross over.

2218
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:00,080
So it's like Snake 360 unavailable on this, right?

2219
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:01,360
That's right.

2220
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,520
None of the old games made it.

2221
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:09,680
The only chance that the old games make it over is if the developer decides to republish

2222
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:09,920
it.

2223
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:15,840
And, you know, they can't just go because some things have changed, things like how

2224
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:21,840
the game save files, because if you think about it, you know, Xbox One works a lot differently

2225
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,520
than 360 in that regard.

2226
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:28,560
You don't have, you know, all you can have a hard drive or a storage unit or, you know,

2227
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:31,440
USB or whatever Xbox work.

2228
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:36,400
The Xbox One works with cloud saves and they follow you everywhere and some different work

2229
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:37,680
has to be done to enable that.

2230
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:39,360
And I am looking into it, by the way.

2231
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:41,760
Nice.

2232
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:49,680
I'm actually hoping to release my first title on the Creator's Collection probably in the

2233
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:52,800
next couple of months, and that's going to be Falling Plus.

2234
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:57,200
I think honestly, Falling Plus is like my Ridge Racer.

2235
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:01,440
I'm releasing it on every platform that I want to be on to get my feet wet.

2236
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,440
And then after that, the other stuff will come.

2237
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:07,040
Falling is kind of your ode to like 80s classics, right?

2238
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:07,760
I've played that one.

2239
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,600
It's kind of a fun little puzzler.

2240
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,600
Feels like something that would have been in an arcade in the 80s.

2241
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,480
That's exactly the vibe I was going for.

2242
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:20,000
It's, you know, basically, I mean, I'm thinking Bubble Bobble.

2243
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:25,600
It doesn't quite have that level of complexity, but, you know, it's basically like, you know,

2244
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:29,920
you're a penguin, the walrus is trying to bust in and colored blocks are falling from

2245
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:30,480
the ceiling.

2246
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:33,680
Of course, later levels, this happens faster.

2247
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:36,800
But what you're doing is you're matching colors to clear the blocks.

2248
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:40,320
And of course, every so often the walrus is going to get in your way and you have to kind

2249
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:44,080
of crush him, smash him against another block, and so on.

2250
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:44,880
Poor walrus.

2251
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:46,800
Yeah.

2252
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:53,360
Let me ask this, like, now, you know, we're 10 years after you putting out, you know,

2253
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,720
Snake 360.

2254
01:44:54,720 --> 01:45:01,520
What have you kind of learned about gaming through this whole, the gaming yourself, the

2255
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:02,080
indie games?

2256
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:05,840
What have you learned through this whole experience of putting a game out and, you know, continuing

2257
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:10,720
to, as a hobbyist, you know, put games out because obviously, you know, we were big fans

2258
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:11,120
of Bungie.

2259
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:12,720
Ferretossing on 360 as well.

2260
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,480
You know, we still stand by Super Multitasking as a game that, and thank you for that.

2261
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,720
Breakthrough is coming any day now on Steam.

2262
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:25,440
And by the way, it's on sale for 20% off at the moment as part of the Steam Autumn sale.

2263
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,000
There you go.

2264
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,040
Which does end soon.

2265
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,280
Cheap plug, but I approve.

2266
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:34,480
Going to chat, ssh100mad, does Falling Plus have a kill screen?

2267
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:35,920
No, sadly it does not.

2268
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:37,920
Bummer.

2269
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:38,400
That's okay.

2270
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:41,840
Maybe, maybe Falling Plus Plus second mix new stage.

2271
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:46,800
But one thing, okay, so what have I learned?

2272
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:55,280
So I mean, Snake 360, I put 11 really hard months of development into.

2273
01:45:55,280 --> 01:46:00,080
I don't think I've ever worked so hard on anything ever, including at my job.

2274
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:01,280
So sorry, job.

2275
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:09,440
But definitely I learned that however hard you think it is to actually put a game together

2276
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:14,880
and release it, multiply that by probably around between 5 and 10.

2277
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,000
And that's how hard it is.

2278
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:21,200
I mean, and most of it comes with, you know, the part at the end.

2279
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:25,200
Because it's one thing to get a game working.

2280
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:25,920
That's easy.

2281
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,960
That's the easy part.

2282
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,240
That's the fun part.

2283
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:33,360
You know, you put together your concept and it's like, hey, I can play this and it's fun.

2284
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:34,720
Great, I'm done.

2285
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,240
No, no, you're not done.

2286
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:40,800
Because now what you have to do is you have to make sure it works at a variety of different

2287
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,760
resolutions.

2288
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:46,400
Because if you're releasing on PC, you don't want to be told, well, you have to run this

2289
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,480
at 720p widescreen.

2290
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:52,240
No, no, actually you want to run it at whatever resolution you want.

2291
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:55,680
And maybe you want it to work with controllers.

2292
01:46:55,680 --> 01:47:00,800
Well, okay, now test it with the Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers and the DualShock

2293
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:06,240
4 and the Steam controller and the Switch Pro controller and make sure it works perfectly

2294
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:07,040
with all of those.

2295
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:11,120
And if you're releasing a Mac version, make sure it works with all of those controllers

2296
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:12,320
on Mac also.

2297
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,400
Man, this QA testing is the worst.

2298
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:15,920
That's why Bethesda doesn't bother.

2299
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:17,860
Right.

2300
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:21,280
But no, you're right.

2301
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,720
I mean, not that that should stop people from making their own game for sure, but there

2302
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:27,440
is a lot more that goes into it that people don't realize.

2303
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:31,200
The polish is really the hardest part.

2304
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:37,920
And not just because you have to be very thorough, but also because it's not the exciting part.

2305
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:41,840
The exciting part is putting your game together and seeing it come to life.

2306
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:50,320
The most amazing part of super multitasking was making it to the point where I had enough

2307
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:55,440
minigames that I could create the algorithm that starts and stops the minigames.

2308
01:47:55,440 --> 01:48:01,600
That magic when it first worked and when I realized the concept was fun, that was magic.

2309
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:02,560
That was awesome.

2310
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:03,520
That was amazing.

2311
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:06,880
I lit up like a Christmas tree and I don't even celebrate Christmas.

2312
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:14,560
So, but, you know, then it's like the actual work of getting the game ready for release.

2313
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:17,200
It's many, many times that.

2314
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:22,320
And Black Wolf in chat says the last 10% of development takes 90% of the time.

2315
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,000
And he's pretty much right.

2316
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:29,120
And also, he said the part YYR is talking about is the part where Loki quits.

2317
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,520
No, he didn't even get that far, but yeah.

2318
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:32,020
Yeah.

2319
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:38,020
I remember I can't even get far enough to mod a stupid theme for set mania.

2320
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:38,340
Okay.

2321
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:40,500
Like I was watching YouTube instead of the day.

2322
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:43,860
Bobby's used that quote before and I've heard that, you know,

2323
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:46,660
similar iterations of that quite a bit when it comes to game development.

2324
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:47,620
It's very true.

2325
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:48,180
Definitely.

2326
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:48,820
So what's next?

2327
01:48:48,820 --> 01:48:53,460
And box 006 is just quickly reminding us that Bethesda does do QA testing.

2328
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:54,740
It's just done by the gamers.

2329
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:57,540
Let's be fair.

2330
01:48:57,540 --> 01:48:59,140
Bethesda does QA testing.

2331
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:01,940
It's just Bethesda exacts a fucking ship it anyways.

2332
01:49:01,940 --> 01:49:02,420
Yeah, exactly.

2333
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:05,620
The boardroom decisions are usually like, eh, it's not that big a deal.

2334
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:06,580
Gamers will buy it anyway.

2335
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:08,580
What's next for you?

2336
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:11,220
What are you gonna use this 10 year of experience in the future?

2337
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:20,420
Well, honestly, I'm not looking forward another 10 years so much as this next year.

2338
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:23,460
And it is a lot more difficult with a baby around.

2339
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:28,500
But I think what I'm really gonna try to do is build my brand or attempt to

2340
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:35,220
over the next year by expanding my offerings on more platforms.

2341
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:39,860
And, you know, just to let everybody know.

2342
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:47,380
So the beginning of that is I'm moving Falling Plus from itch.io where it's been to Steam.

2343
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:51,940
It's actually releasing in five days on November 30th.

2344
01:49:51,940 --> 01:49:53,380
Oh, shoot.

2345
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:54,100
There you go.

2346
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:55,220
Very timely announcement.

2347
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:57,860
People might be listening to this on November 30th.

2348
01:49:58,580 --> 01:50:02,820
Well, if you're listening right now and you're in the chat room, the first thing I'm going

2349
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:08,580
to do when I get off this call is anybody who is in the chat room is going to receive

2350
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:10,580
a Steam key for this game.

2351
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:11,080
What?

2352
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:12,500
That's awesome.

2353
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:13,860
You get Falling Plus.

2354
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:15,540
And you get Falling Plus.

2355
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:17,140
And you get Falling Plus.

2356
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:18,420
You all get Falling Plus.

2357
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:20,340
Oh, ho ho ho.

2358
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:21,780
It's the holiday spirit.

2359
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:22,660
I love it.

2360
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:23,460
That's amazing.

2361
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:26,500
Everybody in the chat room is getting a free game tonight.

2362
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:27,140
That's great.

2363
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:29,060
That's very generous of you, Santa.

2364
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:29,780
I appreciate that.

2365
01:50:29,780 --> 01:50:31,540
And you don't even celebrate Christmas.

2366
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:33,060
But still, the holiday spirit.

2367
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:33,940
It's all there.

2368
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:35,460
Hey, it could be for Hanukkah, too.

2369
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:41,220
Mind you, if you're listening on the podcast feed, it's not, you know, all for naught.

2370
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:47,780
If you send me an email at yyr at yyrgames.com and mention OLR, you will get one as well.

2371
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:48,420
What?

2372
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:49,780
That's crazy.

2373
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:50,660
That's amazing.

2374
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:53,460
You might want to put a deadline on that, though, so that people don't go like, hey.

2375
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:56,100
You have until the next episode is on.

2376
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:56,900
Post a form.

2377
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:57,300
Yeah.

2378
01:50:57,300 --> 01:51:00,180
If you don't recognize a name, yyr, I need to run it by me.

2379
01:51:00,180 --> 01:51:04,100
If you start getting flooded with all these emails from, like, other countries, I pretty

2380
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:06,820
much know who all the listeners in other countries are at this point.

2381
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:08,420
So I'll let you know.

2382
01:51:09,380 --> 01:51:10,660
That's awesome.

2383
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:11,300
So, yeah.

2384
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:13,620
Everybody in the chat room is very jazzed about this.

2385
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:18,420
Boncival06 says, yyr coming in with the gift for all the girls and boys.

2386
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:19,540
Let's see.

2387
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:20,740
Okay.

2388
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:23,060
I like some of these other questions coming in, too.

2389
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:26,260
Oh, BlackWolf wants to know, is it unlocked now or does it unlock on the 30th?

2390
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:28,820
These are pre-release redemption codes.

2391
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:29,940
You can play it right away.

2392
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:31,380
That's awesome.

2393
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:32,420
That is so great.

2394
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:33,620
Okay, cool.

2395
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:38,340
And I think if you if you want to give me money and pay for the game, then feel free

2396
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:39,940
to pass the code on to somebody else.

2397
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,900
That's that's so awesome of you to do.

2398
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:44,340
And actually, let's see.

2399
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:47,140
Well, before I get to that, S2100Matt is asking a question.

2400
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:48,020
I think this is really good.

2401
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:52,340
What are your thoughts on the Intellivision Amico and would you try to get your games

2402
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:53,300
on the console?

2403
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:59,300
You know, Amico is a very unique type of platform that might be kind of trying to cater itself

2404
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:04,020
to more like, you know, developers that are well, first off, they'd have to be exclusive

2405
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:04,340
games.

2406
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:07,300
But I suppose you could always do a falling plus plus or you know what I mean?

2407
01:52:07,940 --> 01:52:12,900
But I mean, since you try to invoke 80s classics, I could see where something like Intellivision

2408
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:13,780
might be right up your alley.

2409
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:21,300
So it's funny that you ask that, because remember I said I'm trying to build my brand.

2410
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:25,300
So there's a multiple pronged approach here.

2411
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:29,300
I am going to be releasing falling plus on Steam.

2412
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:35,700
The next thing I'm going to be working on after a super multitasking update is I'm officially

2413
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:37,860
announcing Bungee Ferret Tossing Turbo.

2414
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:40,820
That will be coming to Steam next.

2415
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:43,060
Yay, Bungee Ferret Tossing is coming back.

2416
01:52:44,260 --> 01:52:45,300
So exciting.

2417
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:46,100
For those that don't know.

2418
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:47,460
Improved graphics.

2419
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:50,500
In case we do have some newer listeners out there, for those who don't know, Bungee Ferret

2420
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:55,540
Tossing was a game YYR made based off a conversation that happened on Orange Lounge Radio.

2421
01:52:55,540 --> 01:52:57,780
We were talking about one of our many dream games.

2422
01:52:57,780 --> 01:53:01,700
YYR made a dream game here on Orange Lounge Radio a reality, which is amazing.

2423
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:08,420
And yes, Bobby Black Wolf, it will have the Wolf News segment, although you are not the

2424
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:08,980
villain, no.

2425
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:16,580
But yes, it'll feature improved graphics and also an arranged mode where not only can you

2426
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:21,540
add turbo speed to it, but also you can unlock all kinds of fun things that will allow you

2427
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:23,620
to tweak the gameplay and break it.

2428
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:27,060
But yeah, so please look forward to that.

2429
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:29,940
I'm hoping to ship it sometime first quarter of next year.

2430
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:37,540
And then once I have that stuff on Steam, I'm also planning to try to release this stuff

2431
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:39,540
on Windows 10 and Xbox One.

2432
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:46,340
Now, I'm hoping to have all that stuff done and possibly a re-release of Snake by the

2433
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:47,620
middle of next year.

2434
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:49,460
Guess what happens the middle of next year?

2435
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:54,100
The Intellivision Amico dev kits become available.

2436
01:53:54,900 --> 01:54:01,940
Now, I am racking my brain when I lay down to sleep, when I'm in the shower, when I'm

2437
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:03,380
doing other things.

2438
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:10,500
I'm racking my brain trying to come up with some good game concepts, not just to make

2439
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:16,980
a game, but to make a game that will play very well on that weirdo controller that they're

2440
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:18,900
shipping with the Amico.

2441
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:24,820
And I wish I could come up with something really great.

2442
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:25,620
And you know what?

2443
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:30,500
I have a couple of beginnings right now, but I'm still working it out.

2444
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:34,500
And I actually think I'm going to pick up in an old Intellivision just so I can get

2445
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:38,180
more of a sense for what the dial is going to feel like.

2446
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:44,420
You might be the first dev I've heard on a show lobbying to make an Intellivision game.

2447
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:47,860
Well, here's the thing.

2448
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:50,900
If you look at the specs, first of all, it has to be something original.

2449
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:51,940
That's fine.

2450
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:54,500
Second of all, it has to be between three and eight bucks.

2451
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:56,500
All my games are between three and eight bucks.

2452
01:54:57,060 --> 01:54:57,460
All right.

2453
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:06,180
They're looking probably to put, you know, retro inspired, short burst types of gameplay.

2454
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:07,220
That's what I do.

2455
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:13,380
It seems to me like it would be silly for me not to try it.

2456
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:15,380
Yeah, we're going to help however we can.

2457
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:16,180
I mean, we've not.

2458
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:17,620
I mean, Tommy is a busy guy.

2459
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:18,660
He's been on the show before.

2460
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:19,460
We have an email.

2461
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:20,340
So, you know, you never know.

2462
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:20,740
You never know.

2463
01:55:20,740 --> 01:55:21,380
We can.

2464
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:23,460
We'll try to help you out best we can.

2465
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:24,980
So that's great.

2466
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:25,380
Thank you.

2467
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:32,660
I really appreciate you given that doing that Oprah moment with falling for all of our chatters

2468
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:33,780
and listeners.

2469
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:34,980
It's really, really great.

2470
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:36,500
It's the least that I can do.

2471
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:41,220
I mean, not only do you guys plug my stuff at every opportunity, but you've also provided

2472
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:45,060
me with all of this entertainment over the last, you know, over ten years.

2473
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:47,700
You do what you do because you love video games.

2474
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:49,540
We do what we do because we love video games.

2475
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:52,660
We all kind of contributed in our own way.

2476
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:54,260
Hey, Bobby wants to know if he can stream.

2477
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:58,900
If there's an embargo on streaming or if he can just stream it after OLR tonight.

2478
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:00,500
Yeah, you can go ahead.

2479
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:01,140
All right.

2480
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:06,100
You know, just mention it's coming out in a few days and that's it.

2481
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:07,940
He'll work in your plug.

2482
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:08,420
You're good.

2483
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:09,800
Awesome.

2484
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:13,380
But yeah, just finishing up the Amico business.

2485
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:20,420
You know, going back to Snake 360, another thing that I did learn is that when you have

2486
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:23,780
a young marketplace, there are more eyeballs looking at it.

2487
01:56:23,780 --> 01:56:29,780
The most money I ever made off of one of my games was when Snake 360 just came out and

2488
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:33,300
there were fewer games on the store and there were lots of eyeballs looking at this brand

2489
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:34,580
new thing that just came out.

2490
01:56:34,580 --> 01:56:36,260
Hey, so you know what's funny?

2491
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:37,700
You know, it's funny why we are.

2492
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:40,260
Do you know when OLR had the most listeners ever?

2493
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:44,260
When it was new, the week iTunes podcasting launched.

2494
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:47,620
Yeah, we make perfect sense.

2495
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:50,020
Remember, this show existed well before then.

2496
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:54,180
We had the to go edition that was on when you had to use like Lemon Potter and all that.

2497
01:56:54,180 --> 01:56:58,020
All those other apps to podcasts on your iPod because there weren't even the phones yet.

2498
01:56:58,020 --> 01:56:59,220
So this show existed back then.

2499
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:04,020
So the week we were on the store, I think there's maybe only like one or two other gaming

2500
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:08,900
podcasts that exist today that were on the store when iTunes launched that.

2501
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:10,740
And we've never been bigger.

2502
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:13,860
And honestly and humbly, we'll probably never be that big again.

2503
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:17,860
But that's what you know what I'm I'm just hoping.

2504
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:21,380
I mean, I haven't been that big since since Snake 360.

2505
01:57:21,380 --> 01:57:27,460
And I'm just hoping that, you know, basically the reason I'm trying to build the brand,

2506
01:57:27,460 --> 01:57:30,660
you know, release a few games on Steam, release a few games on Xbox.

2507
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:33,940
It's like I'm hoping that this is what happens.

2508
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:39,700
YYR Games is announced as one of the first developers on Amico.

2509
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:40,740
Who the heck is that?

2510
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:42,820
They look into me.

2511
01:57:42,820 --> 01:57:44,580
Oh, they have a few games available.

2512
01:57:44,580 --> 01:57:46,020
Hey, this looks interesting.

2513
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:47,140
Click, click, click, bye.

2514
01:57:48,340 --> 01:57:51,700
So maybe, maybe, maybe it'll happen.

2515
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:52,500
Maybe not.

2516
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:54,660
But it's worth a shot, right?

2517
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:57,940
Hey, if we're rooting for anybody here at OLR YYR, it's you.

2518
01:57:57,940 --> 01:57:59,700
We want to we want to see it happen for you.

2519
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:00,980
So you you deserve it.

2520
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:03,300
And not just because you hand our listeners free stuff.

2521
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:06,500
You know, we've supported your your stuff anyway.

2522
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:10,420
So I I really wish you the success and I do hope we get to see your name on television

2523
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:13,220
splash screen, you know, in a year or so.

2524
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:14,260
So thank you.

2525
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:18,740
I will address Bonds006 speaking of the free stuff.

2526
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:21,460
He says, so are we doing QA for your game YYR?

2527
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:24,500
Well, ain't nothing in this world truly free.

2528
01:58:25,060 --> 01:58:28,740
I will tell you this.

2529
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:31,380
This is actually an update to an already released game.

2530
01:58:31,940 --> 01:58:34,660
Although I did fix a number of issues in this version.

2531
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:39,140
The only thing that has not been exhaustively tested is the leaderboard browser.

2532
01:58:39,140 --> 01:58:44,020
So I'm hoping that a few of you play it and that I will be able to, you know, take a look

2533
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:46,180
and quickly patch things if they don't work.

2534
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:51,540
But it should work because it was just based off of super multitaskings and super multitaskings

2535
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:52,420
works.

2536
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:53,780
So it should be fine.

2537
01:58:54,740 --> 01:58:55,220
All right.

2538
01:58:55,220 --> 01:58:56,020
That's but yeah.

2539
01:58:56,020 --> 01:58:56,260
Yeah.

2540
01:58:56,260 --> 01:59:01,380
That's that's still you never know people's weird PC configurations and stuff.

2541
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:03,460
You never know what feedback you might get in the next couple of days.

2542
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:05,060
And that's valuable feedback to have.

2543
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:06,660
Yeah.

2544
01:59:06,660 --> 01:59:08,020
And I'd appreciate it.

2545
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:13,140
So yeah, be sure to do the thumbs up the ratings, do the things that will get a notice because

2546
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:14,740
yeah, we want YYR to succeed.

2547
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:17,940
So yeah, you're already a success YYR.

2548
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:18,260
All right.

2549
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:23,220
We do have to let you go, though, so we can wrap up our show and let Bobby do a stream

2550
01:59:23,220 --> 01:59:23,700
of the game.

2551
01:59:23,700 --> 01:59:26,020
So but thank you so much again.

2552
01:59:26,020 --> 01:59:29,460
And I know we'll have you back on the show soon when you're ready to announce whatever

2553
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:33,620
your next project is coming to steam or wherever it is you go and someday in television.

2554
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,300
All right.

2555
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:35,700
All right.

2556
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:36,660
I'll be here.

2557
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:36,980
All right.

2558
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:37,700
Take care, my friend.

2559
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:38,820
All right.

2560
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:42,900
Have a great week and I'll start sending out those codes momentarily.

2561
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:43,220
All right.

2562
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:43,940
Sounds good.

2563
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:44,660
Thank you so much.

2564
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:44,980
Bye.

2565
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:45,460
Take care.

2566
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:45,780
All right.

2567
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:46,740
Take care, guys.

2568
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:48,020
Bye bye bye.

2569
01:59:48,020 --> 01:59:48,820
That is awesome.

2570
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:52,020
Just so you know, I did not know he was going to do that.

2571
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:55,220
I kind of knew that he was going to tell it.

2572
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:57,940
I knew we were kind of getting the exclusive on a new steam thing like that.

2573
01:59:57,940 --> 01:59:59,940
I knew I did not know he was going to do that.

2574
01:59:59,940 --> 02:00:01,300
So that is really, really cool.

2575
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:02,180
Why we are to do that.

2576
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:03,220
So awesome.

2577
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:03,700
Awesome.

2578
02:00:03,700 --> 02:00:03,940
Yeah.

2579
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:05,460
I'm going to be playing that as well.

2580
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:05,960
All right.

2581
02:00:06,820 --> 02:00:08,180
Anyhow, I know.

2582
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:10,980
Do you want to hear the cruel irony in this whole thing?

2583
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:12,100
That's really funny.

2584
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:15,060
So I guess Ragenator like forgot the shows on the night or something because he's doing

2585
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:16,420
his own Twitch stream, which is fine.

2586
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:17,780
You know, there's only so many days in the week.

2587
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:19,620
You got to do what you got to do when I don't care.

2588
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:23,780
But the one night someone's here giving away a free game on Steam.

2589
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:24,420
He's not here.

2590
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:28,340
Poor guy.

2591
02:00:29,540 --> 02:00:30,820
I can give them a copy.

2592
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:31,140
All right.

2593
02:00:32,180 --> 02:00:33,300
He can send the email.

2594
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:35,700
Everybody knows that dude's name.

2595
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:37,380
Yyr will recognize him in a heartbeat.

2596
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:40,500
I just I would want somebody to be like, oh, email this guy.

2597
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:41,300
He'll give you a free.

2598
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:44,580
Like, I want to make sure that the people who redeem the code are actually people.

2599
02:00:44,580 --> 02:00:45,460
Listen, all are.

2600
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:49,140
So make sure just try to keep it amongst friends, y'all.

2601
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:49,540
All right.

2602
02:00:50,420 --> 02:00:52,260
Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news.

2603
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:54,580
I don't know how we top free game announcement.

2604
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:57,380
Do you do do you get free games listening to other podcasts?

2605
02:00:58,020 --> 02:00:58,820
Not that I'm here to.

2606
02:00:58,820 --> 02:01:00,180
I love I love all podcasts.

2607
02:01:00,180 --> 02:01:00,820
You guys know that.

2608
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:05,700
But I'm going to I'm going to take the little the little promotion opportunities.

2609
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:11,540
We listen to a lot of podcasting where I used to listen to the dev log a lot that, you know,

2610
02:01:11,540 --> 02:01:13,620
unity programming podcasts.

2611
02:01:13,620 --> 02:01:15,300
But I haven't listened to that in a while.

2612
02:01:15,860 --> 02:01:16,900
I need to catch up on that.

2613
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:21,300
But Bobby and chat with the Debbie Downer comment.

2614
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:24,260
Actually, a lot of podcasts give out free codes to every listener.

2615
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:25,620
Bobby, to every listener.

2616
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:26,660
I don't know about that.

2617
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:27,460
I don't know about that.

2618
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:28,180
All right.

2619
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:29,060
Maybe they do.

2620
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:29,380
I don't know.

2621
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:30,340
I thought I thought.

2622
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:31,780
But it's not for this game.

2623
02:01:34,740 --> 02:01:35,700
I'll take what I can get.

2624
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:36,660
Sorry, Loki.

2625
02:01:36,660 --> 02:01:36,900
Yeah.

2626
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:38,340
All right.

2627
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:39,780
Let's get into some rapid fire news.

2628
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:41,780
There is plenty of other stuff going on in the game industry.

2629
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:43,060
We'll do some rapid fire news.

2630
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:43,700
Loki.

2631
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:44,420
All right.

2632
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:50,580
So let's talk a little bit about how Super Mario Odyssey is getting some new costumes.

2633
02:01:50,580 --> 02:01:50,980
Yay.

2634
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:53,300
I haven't played Super Mario Odyssey in a while.

2635
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:56,340
I really should go back and do that because I still haven't gotten all of.

2636
02:01:58,820 --> 02:02:00,180
All of the collectibles in that.

2637
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:07,380
But if you're continuing to play the game, you'll be able to get a Santa outfit or they

2638
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:13,300
also have the 8-bit Mario kind of looks like the 8-bit Mario amiibo that they had.

2639
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:18,580
So you'll be able to check out that kind of voxel Mario look.

2640
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:23,140
And that's going to be coming soon, I believe, in an update.

2641
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:26,500
I imagine it'll probably look like the 8-bit amiibo does kind of in that.

2642
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:27,380
That's exactly what I said.

2643
02:02:27,380 --> 02:02:27,620
OK.

2644
02:02:27,620 --> 02:02:28,260
Oh, sorry.

2645
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:29,540
OK.

2646
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:31,540
So yeah, check it out.

2647
02:02:32,260 --> 02:02:40,740
And then there's an expansion coming to Civ 6, which is going to be February 14th called

2648
02:02:40,740 --> 02:02:41,940
the Gathering Storm.

2649
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:48,980
And apparently it's the second expansion for the game and they're adding, I guess, global

2650
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:52,100
warming or different like weather in the game.

2651
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:57,540
So they have like apparently how you use natural resources.

2652
02:02:58,980 --> 02:03:04,020
It's going to affect the weather, natural disasters and global warming.

2653
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:10,580
So you get the balance between, you know, progress and destroying the planet.

2654
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:12,340
I've been slacking on Civilization 6.

2655
02:03:12,340 --> 02:03:16,820
I need to play more, but I kind of love that they're incorporating this into the game,

2656
02:03:16,820 --> 02:03:21,060
even though it's almost like it kind of reminds me with like flooding was a natural disaster

2657
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:22,180
in the original SimCity.

2658
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:27,380
It's kind of like they've taken that to the next step, which is sadly rooted in reality

2659
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:27,700
a little bit.

2660
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:34,660
Aside from the climate stuff, they also have expanded technology, civic trees into a future

2661
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:38,340
era and adds nine new leaders across eight new civilizations.

2662
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:38,820
Oh, wow.

2663
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:42,100
So is there any civilization you can't be at this point?

2664
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:43,060
It's pretty crazy.

2665
02:03:43,060 --> 02:03:43,560
Epics.

2666
02:03:45,780 --> 02:03:47,140
Yeah, like in winter games.

2667
02:03:47,140 --> 02:03:49,460
And this came out on the Commodore 64.

2668
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:51,060
I don't know if you ever played those Olympic games.

2669
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:53,060
No, I remember the like California games.

2670
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:55,220
Yeah, you could pick what country you were from.

2671
02:03:55,220 --> 02:03:57,220
And one of the countries you could pick was Epics.

2672
02:03:57,220 --> 02:03:59,460
Epics, the studio that made the game.

2673
02:03:59,460 --> 02:04:03,700
So that's the one civilization that's not represented in Civ at this point is Epics.

2674
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:10,580
Anyway, that's at the forefront of my mind because just recently Bobby was doing one

2675
02:04:10,580 --> 02:04:12,900
of his streams of the Commodore 64 mini.

2676
02:04:12,900 --> 02:04:16,500
And so he was playing because like all of those games, because I didn't really realize

2677
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:19,300
this, but they were releasing one of those games like every year.

2678
02:04:19,300 --> 02:04:20,420
They did summer games.

2679
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:21,300
They did winter games.

2680
02:04:21,300 --> 02:04:22,260
They did summer games too.

2681
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:23,460
They did California games.

2682
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:24,580
They did world games.

2683
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:26,180
I forgot that even existed.

2684
02:04:26,180 --> 02:04:26,980
Like they were cranking out those games.

2685
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:29,700
Yeah, I used to play a ton of California games.

2686
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:34,660
That was on, um, I think the NES or Super NES was when I was playing that.

2687
02:04:34,660 --> 02:04:36,260
But then I had that on the Lynx too.

2688
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:42,020
That was my go-to game on the Lynx because the Lynx had, um, it was BMX.

2689
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:44,820
There was surfing, hacky sack.

2690
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:47,140
And I don't remember the last one.

2691
02:04:47,140 --> 02:04:48,100
That was California games.

2692
02:04:48,100 --> 02:04:48,420
Yeah.

2693
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:50,100
Uh, frisbee maybe.

2694
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:50,420
I don't know.

2695
02:04:50,420 --> 02:04:50,580
Yeah.

2696
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:52,100
And it's impossible to catch a frisbee.

2697
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:54,020
That is all on the Commodore 64 mini.

2698
02:04:54,020 --> 02:04:57,860
All those games games are the games games.

2699
02:04:57,860 --> 02:04:58,340
I don't know.

2700
02:04:58,340 --> 02:04:59,380
I don't know what else you call that.

2701
02:04:59,380 --> 02:05:00,740
California is hacky sack.

2702
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:01,700
That's aged well.

2703
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:01,940
Yeah.

2704
02:05:01,940 --> 02:05:02,180
Yeah.

2705
02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:02,500
I know.

2706
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:02,820
Right.

2707
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:04,500
Well, the world games was pretty cool too.

2708
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:05,620
So this is the other head on.

2709
02:05:05,620 --> 02:05:08,100
The BMX one is fun because it's going downhill.

2710
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:12,020
So it was just like, okay, I'm going to Yolo this right now and see what happens,

2711
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:12,420
you know?

2712
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:12,580
Yeah.

2713
02:05:12,580 --> 02:05:15,540
And it's, it's interesting as Bobby Blackwell points out, because it's almost

2714
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:19,780
like a little time capsule of society in the eighties, because you can be from the

2715
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:24,500
USSR, you can be from West Germany and like, you know, because these games were

2716
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:27,540
from 1984, 1985 when the world was different.

2717
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:28,180
Yes.

2718
02:05:28,180 --> 02:05:29,060
Kind of neat.

2719
02:05:29,060 --> 02:05:29,540
Anyway.

2720
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:29,780
Sorry.

2721
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:30,900
I didn't mean to digress too much.

2722
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:31,620
Czechoslovakia.

2723
02:05:32,980 --> 02:05:37,860
Didn't mean to make a civilization six discussion about California games, but

2724
02:05:37,860 --> 02:05:38,660
here we are.

2725
02:05:40,420 --> 02:05:41,300
I did it.

2726
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:42,020
Anyway.

2727
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:46,180
Let's talk about Netflix and shows that are doing very well on Netflix.

2728
02:05:46,180 --> 02:05:48,900
The Castlevania series apparently doing very well.

2729
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:51,540
I've been watching it, thought about it the other day, but then my wife's like,

2730
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:54,900
no, I need to, I need to, I just haven't got around to it.

2731
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:56,340
I keep getting sucked into MMOs.

2732
02:05:56,340 --> 02:06:00,420
But anyway, executive producer, Adisha and car, uh, has mentioned about the

2733
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:01,780
Netflix Castlevania series.

2734
02:06:01,780 --> 02:06:04,100
Uh, it really over performed.

2735
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:05,140
It did crazy.

2736
02:06:05,140 --> 02:06:08,100
Well, we immediately got greenlit for season three.

2737
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:10,340
I wouldn't have a job if it wasn't for the fans.

2738
02:06:10,340 --> 02:06:11,700
So congrats on the success.

2739
02:06:11,700 --> 02:06:13,540
I hear a lot of great things about the anime.

2740
02:06:13,540 --> 02:06:15,380
I will sit down and watch it at some point.

2741
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:18,260
You know, I'm going to watch that ingress anime when it finally comes to Netflix.

2742
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:19,620
Cause it's, oh, is that coming to Netflix?

2743
02:06:19,620 --> 02:06:21,460
It's airing in Japan right now.

2744
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:22,980
So it's doing like the weekly thing in Japan.

2745
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:26,260
And then I think like this month or sometime really soon,

2746
02:06:26,260 --> 02:06:29,300
once all the episodes have aired, then they're going to release it on Netflix.

2747
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:31,940
Am I still going to understand what ingress is about after watching it?

2748
02:06:31,940 --> 02:06:34,100
Cause I fucking don't know what ingress is about.

2749
02:06:34,100 --> 02:06:34,980
I just play the game.

2750
02:06:34,980 --> 02:06:36,820
Like, I don't know the fucking lore is.

2751
02:06:36,820 --> 02:06:39,300
I know this makes any goddamn sense.

2752
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:42,740
It's kind of like, like world of Warcraft has this really deep lore that, you know,

2753
02:06:42,740 --> 02:06:44,660
what it means to be horrid and what it means to be Alliance.

2754
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:46,100
And ingress is kind of the same thing with it.

2755
02:06:46,100 --> 02:06:51,220
Like I keep seeing these like ingress prime advertisements on YouTube and stuff like that.

2756
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:53,940
And they're like, I'm like, I don't fucking know what's going on.

2757
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:57,140
We're seeing, we're seeing some new players, uh, pop up in the game.

2758
02:06:57,140 --> 02:06:59,700
So it's kinda, it's kinda refreshing to have that game kind of

2759
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:03,140
a little, get a little kick in the ass and get invigorated all the free time for that.

2760
02:07:03,140 --> 02:07:04,980
And it's just time, time, time, time.

2761
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:05,460
You know what though?

2762
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:08,420
I found it to be a good, like, because I have been,

2763
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:10,580
there's been the double XP thing that's been going on.

2764
02:07:10,580 --> 02:07:13,380
I don't know if I talked about this in my gaming week, probably just,

2765
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:15,460
I've been trying to focus on the mobile games less.

2766
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:18,180
Cause I know they're kind of like my ongoing, I do them every week,

2767
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:21,220
but I, because double XP is going on in ingress right now,

2768
02:07:21,220 --> 02:07:24,340
like I have been out there trying to do like a lot of micro fielding.

2769
02:07:24,340 --> 02:07:28,260
I was over at one of the cemeteries today, just walking, walking, walking.

2770
02:07:28,260 --> 02:07:32,100
And I was, you know, walking for a good, probably hour out there.

2771
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:35,220
Now granted it's walk, stop, walk, stop, but sometimes it's like,

2772
02:07:35,220 --> 02:07:38,260
Oh, I got to walk from this corner of the cemetery all the way back over there.

2773
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:39,380
Cause I have that key over there.

2774
02:07:39,380 --> 02:07:41,300
So, you know, it's, it's decent exercise.

2775
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:44,340
It's better than sitting at home playing California games, hacky sack.

2776
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:44,580
Yeah.

2777
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:46,100
So there's that.

2778
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:50,260
Anyway, uh, Castlevania is doing very well and looks like it will have a, uh,

2779
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:52,340
another version that's coming out there.

2780
02:07:52,340 --> 02:07:54,660
Um, Loki, you may have to help me on this one.

2781
02:07:54,660 --> 02:07:56,100
Cause for some reason, the story is not loading,

2782
02:07:56,100 --> 02:07:59,540
but I don't know if there's much more to say on this other than that dead or alive,

2783
02:07:59,540 --> 02:08:04,900
extreme three scarlet is coming out for the PlayStation four and the switch.

2784
02:08:04,900 --> 02:08:06,980
That's an odd game for the switch, but okay.

2785
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:07,540
Whatever.

2786
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:11,940
So those of you that are fans of dead or alive extreme, which is, if I remember right,

2787
02:08:11,940 --> 02:08:15,780
the volleyball and the titties and all the anime titties,

2788
02:08:16,660 --> 02:08:17,860
it's actually, it's two different ones.

2789
02:08:17,860 --> 02:08:23,700
So they have the scarlet for PlayStation four and on the switch is dead or life festival 2018.

2790
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:24,500
Oh, excuse me.

2791
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:26,420
So it's going to be a different game.

2792
02:08:26,420 --> 02:08:31,860
I guess that one, they're going to launch, um, March 20th, 2019 in Japan.

2793
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:42,820
And it says, um, Misaka or Misaki who appears in the DMM games, uh, is going to be in dead

2794
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:45,860
or live extreme Venus vacation for PC.

2795
02:08:45,860 --> 02:08:47,380
So there's a PC game coming too.

2796
02:08:48,100 --> 02:08:52,260
Uh, and apparently pre-orders are open and they have an official website open.

2797
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:56,420
So I have no idea why all this is, but I guess we'll find out.

2798
02:08:57,060 --> 02:08:59,940
Uh, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2799
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:02,900
Luckily the chat room is really into the games discussion here.

2800
02:09:02,900 --> 02:09:06,580
Vid power says, I like how hacky sack in California games is called foot bag.

2801
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:07,540
That's right.

2802
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:08,260
It was called foot bag.

2803
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:11,700
And I think it's one of those things kind of like how Kleenex is really tissue,

2804
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:12,660
but everybody calls it Kleenex.

2805
02:09:12,660 --> 02:09:13,060
You know what I mean?

2806
02:09:13,060 --> 02:09:14,500
I think hacky sack is a brand.

2807
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:16,020
So I think that's why they couldn't call it that.

2808
02:09:16,020 --> 02:09:19,300
Um, uh, like Xerox is a copy and all that.

2809
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:23,220
And, uh, if you're, I remember there was some famous court case where like,

2810
02:09:23,220 --> 02:09:28,260
if your name gets associated with it so much, you end up kind of like losing your,

2811
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:30,020
I guess, trademark in some ways or whatever.

2812
02:09:30,020 --> 02:09:33,700
And I think it was Xerox or somebody that lost one of the,

2813
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:37,940
it was one of those big ones that everybody kind of associates, you know, uh, with that.

2814
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:41,300
So, but I think that's, what's what the deal is with hacky sack in that case.

2815
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:45,380
So anyhow, um, all right, let's move on.

2816
02:09:45,380 --> 02:09:48,340
Uh, we're gonna talk about what is coming out in stores this week.

2817
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:50,980
Uh, obviously it's going to be dying down a little bit.

2818
02:09:50,980 --> 02:09:53,620
Although I don't know what smashes next week.

2819
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:58,020
So there, there's still stuff, you know, coming out this week.

2820
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:02,580
So we've got, um, you know, slowing down a little bit, not a whole ton.

2821
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:06,820
I mean like, okay, so like Darksiders three, that's a pretty decent release.

2822
02:10:06,820 --> 02:10:09,220
That's on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

2823
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:13,140
We have spin tires, mud runner, American wilds edition on the switch.

2824
02:10:13,140 --> 02:10:15,140
Oh yeah. I'm sure we all have that pre-ordered.

2825
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:16,740
That's apparently a pretty good racing game.

2826
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:19,940
It's not so much racing. It's like an off-roading game.

2827
02:10:19,940 --> 02:10:24,980
Um, I'll stop talking shit artifact, which is on PC, Mac and Linux.

2828
02:10:24,980 --> 02:10:29,620
Um, Katsuie, Daphne, uh, Kizuna,

2829
02:10:30,660 --> 02:10:33,780
Jigoku, Tachi on PlayStation four.

2830
02:10:33,780 --> 02:10:34,580
It's a shoot them up.

2831
02:10:35,460 --> 02:10:41,540
We have, um, Parkitect on PC, Mac and Linux, uh, persona Q2,

2832
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:46,340
new cinema labyrinth on 3DS arc survival evolved on the switch.

2833
02:10:47,060 --> 02:10:50,900
And let's see fighting ex layer on PC.

2834
02:10:50,900 --> 02:10:51,400
And that's it.

2835
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:52,340
Nice.

2836
02:10:52,980 --> 02:10:53,220
All right.

2837
02:10:53,220 --> 02:10:56,100
Traveling over to Japan, a few releases in Japan this week,

2838
02:10:56,100 --> 02:10:58,420
obviously the calendar runs a little different over there.

2839
02:10:58,420 --> 02:11:00,820
So we do have a few releases on the PlayStation four this week,

2840
02:11:00,820 --> 02:11:06,100
including Katsuie Death Tiny, Kizuna, Jiko, Tachi comes out this week.

2841
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:09,700
Uh, Steel Rats, Million Arthur, Arcana Blood,

2842
02:11:09,700 --> 02:11:14,100
and then Game Tengoku Cruise and Mix Special comes out in a regular

2843
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:17,540
and a limited edition called a Gokuraku Box,

2844
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:19,700
uh, comes out on the PlayStation four this week.

2845
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:24,580
Um, on the switch this week, a game called Lapis Re Abyss comes out this week,

2846
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:28,900
as well as Common Rider Climax Scramble ZO in a, uh,

2847
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:32,980
premium limited edition comes out, uh, this week in Japan as well.

2848
02:11:32,980 --> 02:11:38,020
A game called Billion Road and Super Bomberman R gets a price reduction on the switch.

2849
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:39,460
If you still haven't checked that out.

2850
02:11:39,460 --> 02:11:43,620
Also, I'm sure a lot of people, uh, wanting to check out Overcooked 2.

2851
02:11:43,620 --> 02:11:46,660
If you're in Japan, you get your release of that game, which, um,

2852
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:49,220
I I've watched my buddy JD play those games a little bit,

2853
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:51,860
but I haven't really played them a lot myself, but I hear they're an awful lot of fun.

2854
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:53,620
So I probably need to spend more time with it.

2855
02:11:53,620 --> 02:11:54,660
Hey, guess what?

2856
02:11:54,660 --> 02:11:57,380
The Vita, the plug has not been pulled on the Vita yet.

2857
02:11:57,380 --> 02:11:59,460

02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:08,740

02:12:08,740 --> 02:12:12,820

2870
02:12:51,220 --> 02:12:51,620
All right.

2871
02:12:51,620 --> 02:12:54,580
Let's get to the email because you guys send us emails and we love to read them.

2872
02:12:57,380 --> 02:13:01,380
Also, I'll never get sick of this song.

2873
02:13:02,420 --> 02:13:02,900
Still happy.

2874
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:05,780
We're still going to, we might change some of the music when we move over to Twitch,

2875
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:08,100
but I don't think I could ever get rid of journey to the Wonderland.

2876
02:13:08,100 --> 02:13:09,060
I love this song too much.

2877
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:09,460
Yeah.

2878
02:13:09,460 --> 02:13:09,780
All right.

2879
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:13,300
Anyway, uh, let's, uh, get to an email this week.

2880
02:13:13,300 --> 02:13:17,460
The first one is from YYR who was just on this program for several minutes, but you

2881
02:13:17,460 --> 02:13:19,220
know what to monopolize all the segments.

2882
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:19,700
You know what though?

2883
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:22,020
If you're going to give a game away for free on the show, I'm going to let you have

2884
02:13:22,020 --> 02:13:22,660
all the time you want.

2885
02:13:22,660 --> 02:13:23,380
So here you go.

2886
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:25,620
Actually, and there's some good, uh, there's some good thoughts and points in this

2887
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:26,740
email, so let's get to it.

2888
02:13:26,740 --> 02:13:28,580
YYR send us an email.

2889
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:29,540
It says, hello, LR.

2890
02:13:29,540 --> 02:13:31,460
Just a few thoughts on last week's episode.

2891
02:13:31,460 --> 02:13:32,740
Rob, your suspicion was correct.

2892
02:13:32,740 --> 02:13:36,500
The version of Tetris on NES that was created and published by Nintendo themselves was

2893
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:41,460
strictly a single player affair and had no multiplayer of any kind.

2894
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:46,580
Uh, it was also hot garbage compared to the far superior Tenken version, which is still

2895
02:13:46,580 --> 02:13:50,820
to date the only console version of Tetris that has a co-op mode where two players position

2896
02:13:50,820 --> 02:13:53,300
pieces in the same well at the same time.

2897
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:54,020
It's awesome.

2898
02:13:54,020 --> 02:13:57,140
And everyone should try it out as at least once.

2899
02:13:57,140 --> 02:14:00,660
You know what the NES version had, I swear to God, do you know what the NES version had

2900
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:05,780
that made it like that, that part of the reason why people remember it more so it's on

2901
02:14:05,780 --> 02:14:06,660
the music.

2902
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:08,420
It's the music in the NES version.

2903
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:15,060
I'm telling you, you it's that, that song is still in this Tetris effect, 1989 skin.

2904
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:16,500
All it says is crazy.

2905
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:21,060
Anyway, not that I'm slamming Tengen Tetris because obviously I remember that that

2906
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:21,700
version.

2907
02:14:21,700 --> 02:14:22,900
That's what I had thought last week.

2908
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:27,540
I thought people really desired that version of the game because it had something special

2909
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:29,300
that they took out of the Nintendo one.

2910
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:30,340
I thought it was multiplayer.

2911
02:14:30,340 --> 02:14:32,580
And as it turns out, I was right.

2912
02:14:33,780 --> 02:14:38,100
All right, on the subject of Microsoft and whether they should care about Japan, quite

2913
02:14:38,100 --> 02:14:39,460
honestly, I don't think they should bother.

2914
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:44,900
They put in a lot of effort back in the 360 days, recruiting Japanese developers, producing

2915
02:14:44,900 --> 02:14:47,460
exclusive JRPGs, and what did it get them?

2916
02:14:47,460 --> 02:14:52,420
By the end of the generation, they still had only sold about 1.6 million 360s in Japan

2917
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:55,140
versus 10 million PlayStation threes.

2918
02:14:55,140 --> 02:15:00,260
Worse yet, none of the momentum they had built carried over to the Xbox one, which is floundering

2919
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:02,740
there somewhere around the a hundred K mark.

2920
02:15:02,740 --> 02:15:05,140
Yeah, but I think Microsoft like gave up.

2921
02:15:05,140 --> 02:15:09,300
Like, I think honestly, a lot of those sales are like, you know how like people here will

2922
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:11,140
import stuff from Japan, like really?

2923
02:15:11,140 --> 02:15:15,700
I think there are people players in Japan that will import stuff from America that they

2924
02:15:15,700 --> 02:15:16,980
don't necessarily always get.

2925
02:15:16,980 --> 02:15:19,540
Like a lot of the Western stuff that's developed over here.

2926
02:15:19,540 --> 02:15:19,940
Possibly.

2927
02:15:19,940 --> 02:15:20,420
Yeah.

2928
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:22,340
Things like Fortnite weren't developed in Japan.

2929
02:15:22,340 --> 02:15:24,580
And there's probably people over there that want to play that type of stuff.

2930
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:27,700
I mean, that's a bad example because I'm sure there's a localized.

2931
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:31,380
I know what a World of Warcraft was.

2932
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:32,900
A big example that always has come up.

2933
02:15:32,900 --> 02:15:34,580
They don't have World of Warcraft in Japan.

2934
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:38,820
That's that's another reason why Final Fantasy 14 has been able to succeed in many ways.

2935
02:15:38,820 --> 02:15:39,700
It's not as big as WoW.

2936
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:44,260
I'm not trying to say that, but in Japan, it's bigger because WoW doesn't exist.

2937
02:15:44,260 --> 02:15:45,460
So anyway, that's an example.

2938
02:15:47,540 --> 02:15:48,500
Let's see, where was I?

2939
02:15:49,220 --> 02:15:55,140
Oh, not to mention, console hardware sales in Japan have decreased literally every year

2940
02:15:55,140 --> 02:16:00,740
since 2006, only increasing in 2017, mostly due to the launch of the Switch.

2941
02:16:00,740 --> 02:16:04,420
I just feel like getting Japan to care about an Xbox console will be way too expensive

2942
02:16:04,420 --> 02:16:06,260
and to justify the potential reward.

2943
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:09,540
Xbox remains popular in America and to a lesser extent, Europe.

2944
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:13,540
If game developers want to sell to this audience, regardless of where they're located, they

2945
02:16:13,540 --> 02:16:15,940
can consider Xbox development and leave it at that.

2946
02:16:15,940 --> 02:16:18,340
And for me, maybe that's what it comes down to.

2947
02:16:18,340 --> 02:16:21,620
It's not even so much the fans as much as it is the developer.

2948
02:16:21,620 --> 02:16:25,700
And granted, maybe my perspective is a little bit skewed because I tend to gravitate more

2949
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:27,700
towards the Japanese RPGs.

2950
02:16:27,700 --> 02:16:31,300
Hell, this show was founded around a Japanese-based music game.

2951
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:34,100
So I think I just tend to gravitate towards those games.

2952
02:16:34,100 --> 02:16:38,500
But even in the 16 years we've been doing Orange Launch Radio, I think we've seen a,

2953
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:40,660
you know, very like Japan market.

2954
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:42,260
Oh, well, our market.

2955
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:44,900
Well, that's a unique market to US market.

2956
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:48,260
Europe market has become more and more and more of a worldwide market.

2957
02:16:48,260 --> 02:16:51,540
Hence why we don't have regions on the Switch anymore.

2958
02:16:51,540 --> 02:16:53,380
And, you know, it's more becoming a thing.

2959
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:54,980
You just you don't have any systems.

2960
02:16:54,980 --> 02:16:55,480
You know what I mean?

2961
02:16:56,660 --> 02:17:03,540
Anyway, lastly, Loki mused about why Cruise and Blast hadn't come out on Switch.

2962
02:17:03,540 --> 02:17:05,060
I think the reason is simple.

2963
02:17:05,060 --> 02:17:10,420
It was developed by Raw Thrills, a company that exclusively develops arcade games.

2964
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:12,180
They don't do any work on consoles.

2965
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:16,420
So unless Nintendo contracts another developer to do the port, I don't think we'll ever see one.

2966
02:17:17,060 --> 02:17:19,780
Thanks, as always, for the show and have a great week.

2967
02:17:19,780 --> 02:17:21,380
Have fun YYR.

2968
02:17:21,380 --> 02:17:24,100
Or any Cruise and Game because it's still Nintendo property.

2969
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:28,180
I mean, yeah, but those Raw Thrills, they do a lot of those arcade experiences.

2970
02:17:28,180 --> 02:17:30,020
I feel like everything you see in arcade.

2971
02:17:30,020 --> 02:17:31,300
That's exactly what I was gonna say.

2972
02:17:31,300 --> 02:17:32,580
All the games are out there.

2973
02:17:32,580 --> 02:17:33,700
It's like Raw Thrills.

2974
02:17:33,700 --> 02:17:34,420
I mean, even they do.

2975
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:37,780
Hey, props to him for keeping it alive, honestly.

2976
02:17:37,860 --> 02:17:40,900
Yeah, they're usually a big draw for a lot of the stuff there.

2977
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:45,300
Speaking of things that are alive and things that are not going to be alive much longer.

2978
02:17:45,300 --> 02:17:49,060
Another thing that YYR brought up in chat earlier, Guitar Hero TV,

2979
02:17:49,060 --> 02:17:52,260
that whole Guitar Hero online mode, that's gone December 1st.

2980
02:17:52,820 --> 02:17:55,700
So, yeah, it's kind of shrugged my shoulders.

2981
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:58,420
It was like $5 at Target the other day.

2982
02:17:58,420 --> 02:18:03,540
It's unfortunate that the music game Renaissance, like coming,

2983
02:18:03,540 --> 02:18:07,620
like the Renaissance to the Renaissance, when Rock Band 4 and this new Guitar Hero,

2984
02:18:08,100 --> 02:18:10,180
it's kind of sad that that kind of all hit with a whimper.

2985
02:18:10,740 --> 02:18:14,980
It's not because of, I mean, it's, I understand it's a lot of is because it's

2986
02:18:14,980 --> 02:18:19,300
expensive to license music and stuff, and so they have to monetize it and everything.

2987
02:18:19,300 --> 02:18:23,620
But at the same time, I also feel like that it's Activision and they want to

2988
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:25,860
fucking monetize that into the fucking ground.

2989
02:18:25,860 --> 02:18:31,300
So, you know, I don't feel entirely as bad.

2990
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:36,420
I just wish it was more of like, hey, we have original music a la like DJ Hero, you know?

2991
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:38,580
I don't know.

2992
02:18:38,580 --> 02:18:45,300
Maybe those games need more original tracks in them and relied less on licensed stuff.

2993
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:46,580
Although license does sell.

2994
02:18:47,220 --> 02:18:49,620
Act F points out Rock Band is still going as far as I know.

2995
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:54,420
But it's not, it's, it's, it's not dominating the conversation like it used to.

2996
02:18:54,420 --> 02:18:56,340
You know, Rock Band 2 is the new thing.

2997
02:18:56,340 --> 02:18:56,900
You know what I mean?

2998
02:18:56,900 --> 02:19:00,580
It's kind of, it's, it's fallen back into the niche thing, which is, which is fine.

2999
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:01,140
But anyway.

3000
02:19:01,940 --> 02:19:02,340
All right.

3001
02:19:02,980 --> 02:19:03,540
Let's move on.

3002
02:19:03,540 --> 02:19:04,260
More emails.

3003
02:19:04,260 --> 02:19:06,420
Robert M emails us and says, welcome back.

3004
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:08,100
You seem to pick a heck of a week off.

3005
02:19:08,820 --> 02:19:10,020
Not that it could have been planned.

3006
02:19:10,020 --> 02:19:10,500
Yeah, it is.

3007
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:14,180
I've been saying for like, ever since I bought those tickets to the Fan Fest, I'm like, we're

3008
02:19:14,180 --> 02:19:15,060
not going to be here that week.

3009
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:17,060
Weird question.

3010
02:19:17,060 --> 02:19:22,340
With Incineroar in Smash Brothers Ultimate and Desuadeye in Pokken Tournament, do you

3011
02:19:22,340 --> 02:19:24,580
think we'll see pre-Marinera?

3012
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:28,500
I always want to say pre-Marinera, but that's not what I was going to say.

3013
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:29,540
It's pre-Marina.

3014
02:19:30,180 --> 02:19:31,220
Cause like a ocean.

3015
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:32,660
I always want to say pre-Marinera.

3016
02:19:33,620 --> 02:19:36,500
Do you think we'll say pre-Marina and in what?

3017
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:45,300
It's honestly is my least favorite of the three starters, but I know pre-Marina has

3018
02:19:45,300 --> 02:19:45,700
fans.

3019
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:47,140
So I don't know.

3020
02:19:48,820 --> 02:19:50,740
Maybe in a Let's Go game in the future.

3021
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:51,380
I'll go with that.

3022
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:53,060
I'm going to go without the safe answer.

3023
02:19:53,060 --> 02:19:56,820
Since you have the option to give you, gift you stuff via internet.

3024
02:19:56,820 --> 02:20:01,300
So yeah, I don't know, but I get, well, the point Robert M is getting at is that you've

3025
02:20:01,300 --> 02:20:02,740
got one fighting game over here.

3026
02:20:02,740 --> 02:20:04,100
You got Pokken with Desuadeye.

3027
02:20:04,100 --> 02:20:06,820
You got one fighting game over here with Incineroar, Smash Brothers.

3028
02:20:06,820 --> 02:20:09,780
So where's the fighting game that pre-Marina is going to go in?

3029
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:10,660
You know what?

3030
02:20:10,660 --> 02:20:11,780
They'll get an RPG.

3031
02:20:13,140 --> 02:20:15,300
I guess, I guess Pokemon's an RPG.

3032
02:20:15,300 --> 02:20:17,700
We don't know what the DLC is going to be yet.

3033
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:18,340
Yeah.

3034
02:20:18,340 --> 02:20:18,740
You know what?

3035
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:22,660
Maybe, maybe in the future, you know, wait like 14 years from now and we'll get like

3036
02:20:22,660 --> 02:20:26,900
Pokemon Let's Go pre-Marinera for your pasta.

3037
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:27,140
All right.

3038
02:20:27,140 --> 02:20:33,700
Anyway, pre-Marinera noodles, pre-Marinera and noodles, just dry noodles and tangela.

3039
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:34,180
That's it.

3040
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:40,900
Pre it's, it's a match made in heaven pre-Marinera and tangela and tangela pops out of a box.

3041
02:20:40,900 --> 02:20:42,500
I'm back, back, back again.

3042
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:42,820
All right.

3043
02:20:42,820 --> 02:20:50,020
Anyway, um, also, do you think there will be representation of the sun and moon era in

3044
02:20:50,020 --> 02:20:51,460
detective Pikachu?

3045
02:20:51,460 --> 02:20:53,940
We never did get a chance to really talk about that trailer.

3046
02:20:53,940 --> 02:20:55,140
The detective Pikachu trailer.

3047
02:20:55,140 --> 02:20:55,700
Awesome.

3048
02:20:55,700 --> 02:20:59,620
It was, I was, it was one of those things that I was kind of like, that's not what I

3049
02:20:59,620 --> 02:21:03,300
expected at all, but I don't hate it.

3050
02:21:04,020 --> 02:21:08,100
I was like, I kind of like the whole like Pokemon are real.

3051
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:10,100
You guys know they're real.

3052
02:21:10,980 --> 02:21:12,180
Like they look real.

3053
02:21:13,140 --> 02:21:15,060
They look furry when they shouldn't look furry.

3054
02:21:15,060 --> 02:21:16,260
It's it's animals.

3055
02:21:16,260 --> 02:21:17,700
They're supposed to be furry.

3056
02:21:17,700 --> 02:21:18,580
I know, I know.

3057
02:21:19,460 --> 02:21:20,180
They look weird.

3058
02:21:20,980 --> 02:21:23,540
Anyway, um, let's see.

3059
02:21:23,540 --> 02:21:27,540
And, uh, do you think there'll be representation, representation of that in detective Pikachu?

3060
02:21:27,540 --> 02:21:28,420
I think so.

3061
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:32,660
I think even if it's just a little throw away, you know, the sun and moon still are the current

3062
02:21:32,660 --> 02:21:33,300
games.

3063
02:21:33,300 --> 02:21:37,140
And I don't think, I think gen eight will be a holiday release at this point.

3064
02:21:37,140 --> 02:21:41,060
I think let's go seems to be doing well enough that it's kind of like Nintendo can kind of

3065
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:43,940
rest on that for an entire year till we get to next holiday.

3066
02:21:43,940 --> 02:21:49,460
They're going to do like, let's go something that's going to be, I don't know, cross between

3067
02:21:49,460 --> 02:21:54,740
the two, like no gen two, let's go Sentret and a Spinarak.

3068
02:21:54,740 --> 02:21:55,460
I don't know.

3069
02:21:55,460 --> 02:21:59,460
I'm just saying like, you know, cause they had, um, you know, they always do like, you

3070
02:21:59,460 --> 02:22:01,860
know, red and blue and then, Oh, Hey, yellow.

3071
02:22:01,860 --> 02:22:05,380
And it's like the two combined together or is that, well, let's go.

3072
02:22:05,380 --> 02:22:08,580
Pikachu kind of is flat out a remake of yellow.

3073
02:22:09,140 --> 02:22:13,300
And then all they did with let's go Eevee is they just kind of substituted Pikachu.

3074
02:22:13,300 --> 02:22:16,900
Well, my understanding is, is, but it's not, it's not that you're playing this radically

3075
02:22:16,900 --> 02:22:17,460
different game.

3076
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:19,380
It's just that you've got Eevee instead of Pikachu.

3077
02:22:19,380 --> 02:22:23,220
And some of the ones you run across are different, but they're not like fundamentally different

3078
02:22:23,220 --> 02:22:24,340
plots or anything like that.

3079
02:22:25,300 --> 02:22:27,700
And were the other games fundamentally different?

3080
02:22:27,700 --> 02:22:30,100
I just want to be clear before somebody calls me out on it.

3081
02:22:30,100 --> 02:22:35,540
Let's go is also not really a directory make of yellow because the character of blue and

3082
02:22:35,540 --> 02:22:37,220
I think red are in it.

3083
02:22:37,220 --> 02:22:41,620
So it's kind of like you're going through the footsteps of what these characters went

3084
02:22:41,620 --> 02:22:42,820
through 20 years ago.

3085
02:22:42,820 --> 02:22:45,540
And plus it does have things like Alolan Pokemon.

3086
02:22:45,540 --> 02:22:47,380
And I think I heard mega forms are in it too.

3087
02:22:47,380 --> 02:22:47,860
Yes.

3088
02:22:47,860 --> 02:22:50,020
Mega evolution, which didn't exist in gen one.

3089
02:22:50,020 --> 02:22:55,380
So it's, it's very much like a remix, but it's most rooted in Pokemon.

3090
02:22:55,380 --> 02:23:00,340
You get like the X and Y megas for like Mewtwo as well, which I'm assuming that's from X

3091
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:00,900
and Y.

3092
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:02,660
So that whole thing started.

3093
02:23:02,660 --> 02:23:02,900
Yeah.

3094
02:23:02,900 --> 02:23:04,180
X and Y was where that started.

3095
02:23:04,180 --> 02:23:05,460
So six gen six.

3096
02:23:05,460 --> 02:23:05,780
Yeah.

3097
02:23:05,780 --> 02:23:07,620
So there's, it's all sorts of weird.

3098
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:09,620
And then Miltan, which is technically gen eight.

3099
02:23:09,620 --> 02:23:11,220
So, you know, you have that in there too.

3100
02:23:11,220 --> 02:23:11,700
Yeah.

3101
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:19,140
So, Oh, act deft also points out Eevee was the rival Pokemon in yellow because in the

3102
02:23:19,140 --> 02:23:23,700
other games you had to pick Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, and your rival would always pick

3103
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:25,220
whatever was strong.

3104
02:23:25,220 --> 02:23:30,340
Cause you know, Charmander beats a Bulbasaur beats Squirtle beats Charmander.

3105
02:23:30,340 --> 02:23:33,380
So your rival would always pick whatever was strong.

3106
02:23:33,380 --> 02:23:37,220
But since there isn't that in Pokemon yellow, your rival picks Eevee.

3107
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:40,180
So yeah.

3108
02:23:40,180 --> 02:23:44,500
And I named my rival name because like, I was trying to think of something clever, but

3109
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:46,820
it was late and I, I didn't think of anything clever.

3110
02:23:46,820 --> 02:23:48,580
So I just did a God of war meme.

3111
02:23:48,580 --> 02:23:50,100
So his name is boy.

3112
02:23:53,860 --> 02:23:55,300
My rival is Mr. Smoosh.

3113
02:23:55,300 --> 02:23:56,020
Mr. Smoosh.

3114
02:23:56,020 --> 02:23:57,460
Yeah, that's better than mine.

3115
02:23:57,460 --> 02:23:58,340
I did it on stream.

3116
02:23:58,340 --> 02:24:01,460
My kids, unprompted, did each other.

3117
02:24:01,460 --> 02:24:02,900
So, you know, that's funny.

3118
02:24:05,060 --> 02:24:05,700
That was kind of funny.

3119
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:08,340
But your rival's not really like your rival.

3120
02:24:08,580 --> 02:24:13,620
Like, it's just like your little buddy that also wants to succeed and is always testing

3121
02:24:13,620 --> 02:24:13,860
you.

3122
02:24:13,860 --> 02:24:18,980
So anyway, here we, there, there we go back on our Pokemon bullshit, but that's, that's

3123
02:24:18,980 --> 02:24:19,620
because of the email.

3124
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:20,340
I blame the email.

3125
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:25,060
Speaking of movie trailers though, you know, I got to digress for a minute.

3126
02:24:25,060 --> 02:24:29,460
I got to ask about, cause y'all the Lion King, the Lion King.

3127
02:24:29,460 --> 02:24:31,380
What'd you think of that Lion King preview?

3128
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:32,820
That looked hot to me.

3129
02:24:32,820 --> 02:24:34,180
Recycling their properties.

3130
02:24:34,180 --> 02:24:35,620
I don't give a shit.

3131
02:24:35,620 --> 02:24:37,300
Like it looks really good.

3132
02:24:37,380 --> 02:24:39,860
It looks so like, well, here's the thing, like, honestly.

3133
02:24:39,860 --> 02:24:40,100
Okay.

3134
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:45,940
Have you ever seen the Broadway show where it's like people in puppets, but it looks

3135
02:24:45,940 --> 02:24:47,140
very classic.

3136
02:24:47,140 --> 02:24:49,780
I thought that's what the movie was going to be.

3137
02:24:49,780 --> 02:24:54,660
I thought the movie was going to be like people in puppet outfits, but it was done in a very

3138
02:24:54,660 --> 02:24:57,860
like, like I know it sounds ridiculous when I say it, but if you've seen the Broadway

3139
02:24:57,860 --> 02:25:00,740
show, it's very artistic and very well done.

3140
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:04,660
Like spoiler alert for a Broadway show that's been out there forever.

3141
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:10,820
When they start the Lion King, obviously it's the circle of life, you know, the big opening,

3142
02:25:10,820 --> 02:25:11,060
right?

3143
02:25:11,060 --> 02:25:12,500
Everybody fucking knows that song.

3144
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:15,060
If you've ever seen the Lion King in your life, that's the big song.

3145
02:25:15,060 --> 02:25:19,860
So when you see it in the theater or in the, uh, in the Broadway theater, uh, or if it

3146
02:25:19,860 --> 02:25:23,300
travels around, whatever, like not only do people come out on stage, but then all of

3147
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:25,060
a sudden people are coming down the aisles.

3148
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:28,820
You have these big giraffes and elephant puppets that come down the aisles and they're all

3149
02:25:28,820 --> 02:25:29,220
around you.

3150
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:32,420
And so it's like, everything is surrounding you and it's magnificent.

3151
02:25:32,420 --> 02:25:34,100
It's like, holy shit.

3152
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:36,580
This is not like your normal type of play.

3153
02:25:36,580 --> 02:25:41,780
So I thought the movie was going to be like the puppetry type of stuff because I thought

3154
02:25:41,780 --> 02:25:45,300
when you hear live action, I didn't think it was just going to be, Oh, they're going

3155
02:25:45,300 --> 02:25:48,580
to make everybody look like beast in beauty and the beast.

3156
02:25:48,580 --> 02:25:48,820
Yeah.

3157
02:25:48,820 --> 02:25:52,820
It's just like, it's just like the live action Aladdin that they're doing the live action.

3158
02:25:52,820 --> 02:25:54,420
You know, now it's live action.

3159
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:56,260
I'm wondering though, are they going to incorporate?

3160
02:25:56,260 --> 02:26:01,700
Cause wasn't, didn't they add like parts to the Broadway play that aren't in the, uh,

3161
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:05,140
yeah, like they do like an extra, they do some extra songs because they did that with

3162
02:26:05,140 --> 02:26:06,420
beauty and the beast too.

3163
02:26:06,420 --> 02:26:06,580
Yeah.

3164
02:26:06,580 --> 02:26:09,060
But the interesting thing about the beauty and the beast remake is they didn't put in

3165
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:10,660
songs from the play.

3166
02:26:10,660 --> 02:26:12,260
They just made up new songs.

3167
02:26:12,260 --> 02:26:12,900
I thought they did.

3168
02:26:12,900 --> 02:26:14,580
Oh, I thought it was the one from the play.

3169
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:15,380
No, they didn't.

3170
02:26:15,380 --> 02:26:20,420
Uh, I know, like, I think there was a song in the movie called morning report that got

3171
02:26:20,420 --> 02:26:22,580
cut and that is in the play.

3172
02:26:22,580 --> 02:26:23,220
Right.

3173
02:26:23,220 --> 02:26:25,060
So maybe it'll be in this live action movie.

3174
02:26:25,060 --> 02:26:28,340
I don't think that's what I'm thinking because yeah, they did have a deleted song.

3175
02:26:28,340 --> 02:26:29,060
Yeah.

3176
02:26:29,060 --> 02:26:33,620
And in, um, in beauty and the beast, they deleted a song from the movie called human

3177
02:26:33,620 --> 02:26:34,260
again.

3178
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:34,740
Yes.

3179
02:26:34,740 --> 02:26:36,420
Which they put in the play.

3180
02:26:36,980 --> 02:26:38,500
And I think that was in the movie though.

3181
02:26:38,500 --> 02:26:39,940
I don't think they did it in the remake.

3182
02:26:40,580 --> 02:26:41,780
I thought it was.

3183
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:43,620
It was not in the, not in the cartoon.

3184
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:46,500
Human again was not in the cartoon, but it was on like the Blu-ray.

3185
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:47,220
Yeah.

3186
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:47,940
Yeah.

3187
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:51,380
So, but I think it was in the remake.

3188
02:26:51,380 --> 02:26:51,860
Was it?

3189
02:26:51,860 --> 02:26:52,660
I don't know.

3190
02:26:52,660 --> 02:26:54,580
I can't keep it all straight anymore.

3191
02:26:54,580 --> 02:26:55,220
Jesus.

3192
02:26:55,220 --> 02:26:55,620
All right.

3193
02:26:55,620 --> 02:26:57,860
Anyway, who knew you were getting a movie show?

3194
02:26:57,860 --> 02:26:58,820
All right, let's go.

3195
02:26:58,820 --> 02:27:00,580
But again, I blame the emailer.

3196
02:27:00,580 --> 02:27:02,420
This is what happens, but we love it.

3197
02:27:02,420 --> 02:27:06,260
But you see now that we've asked about detective Pikachu and now we're talking about detective

3198
02:27:06,260 --> 02:27:06,740
Pikachu.

3199
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:10,740
So like regarding that, so detective Pikachu, you know, like it was something that when

3200
02:27:10,740 --> 02:27:14,580
I heard it was coming out, I was like, kind of, eh, I don't know if I want to see that,

3201
02:27:14,580 --> 02:27:19,300
but then now I do want to see that now makes me kind of curious.

3202
02:27:19,300 --> 02:27:21,300
Not necessarily like I'm jumping on board.

3203
02:27:21,300 --> 02:27:24,500
Oh, by the way, and this is kind of segwaying into what I'm talking about here.

3204
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:29,860
So there was a cameo in Wreck-It Ralph 2, Sonic the Hedgehog explaining the Internet,

3205
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:33,780
which I thought was funny because, you know, Sonic the Hedgehog is very prevalent on social

3206
02:27:33,780 --> 02:27:35,460
media and it's kind of funny like that.

3207
02:27:35,460 --> 02:27:38,740
But anyway, speaking of Sonic the Hedgehog, so I'm kind of curious now to see the Sonic

3208
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:44,980
the Hedgehog live action trailer, which could be hot garbage, but Jim Carrey and I totally

3209
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:46,740
will see it because it has Jim Carrey in it.

3210
02:27:46,740 --> 02:27:47,140
I know.

3211
02:27:47,140 --> 02:27:48,020
All right.

3212
02:27:48,020 --> 02:27:52,340
Which again, if people don't know where Loki comes from, it actually has nothing to do

3213
02:27:52,340 --> 02:27:54,820
with the Marvel character, Loki.

3214
02:27:54,820 --> 02:27:56,500
You got Loki from the mask, would you?

3215
02:27:56,500 --> 02:27:57,380
It was from the mask.

3216
02:27:57,380 --> 02:27:57,880
Yeah.

3217
02:27:58,500 --> 02:28:00,420
Yes, because I am a fan of Jim Carrey.

3218
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:00,920
All right.

3219
02:28:01,460 --> 02:28:02,180
I need to see his show.

3220
02:28:02,180 --> 02:28:05,220
Yes, and I did see the Stan Lee cameo in Wreck-It Ralph 2 as well.

3221
02:28:05,220 --> 02:28:05,720
All right.

3222
02:28:06,260 --> 02:28:07,220
Anyhow, moving on.

3223
02:28:07,220 --> 02:28:08,660
One more email from Robert M.

3224
02:28:08,660 --> 02:28:13,060
I also see that for those who were understandably turned off by Animal Crossing Pocket Camp's

3225
02:28:13,060 --> 02:28:17,460
loot box, fortune cookies, they're adding a cabin you can arrange your collected furniture

3226
02:28:17,460 --> 02:28:17,860
in.

3227
02:28:17,860 --> 02:28:20,580
So after one year, you can finally have a house.

3228
02:28:21,460 --> 02:28:24,500
I don't know if you borrow bells from Dom Nook to expand it.

3229
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:28,180
I'm not quite as excited as for the Switch version, but very interested to see how this

3230
02:28:28,180 --> 02:28:29,060
works out.

3231
02:28:29,060 --> 02:28:33,860
Like, Robert M., with all respect, and I think you're saying you're in the same boat here.

3232
02:28:33,860 --> 02:28:38,580
The minute they announced that Switch version, uninstalled Animal Crossing from my phone.

3233
02:28:38,580 --> 02:28:39,220
Who cares?

3234
02:28:39,220 --> 02:28:39,780
Who cares?

3235
02:28:39,780 --> 02:28:40,580
Sorry.

3236
02:28:40,580 --> 02:28:41,700
Good thing Jamie's not here.

3237
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:43,940
She kicked my ass because I'm sure she's still playing it.

3238
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:46,020
But who cares?

3239
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:47,540
We have a Switch version on the way.

3240
02:28:47,540 --> 02:28:50,420
I got to prepare myself for that because it's going to be epic.

3241
02:28:51,220 --> 02:28:51,940
All right.

3242
02:28:51,940 --> 02:28:52,900
That's it for emails.

3243
02:28:52,900 --> 02:28:53,940
You should send us emails.

3244
02:28:53,940 --> 02:28:56,740
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

3245
02:28:56,740 --> 02:28:59,940
But for now, we have some more stories before we get to the Skype line.

3246
02:29:00,740 --> 02:29:03,380
We'll try to, we're going to try to kind of run through these stories to make sure we

3247
02:29:03,380 --> 02:29:04,500
have plenty of time for Skype.

3248
02:29:05,380 --> 02:29:06,340
So let's get to it.

3249
02:29:06,340 --> 02:29:06,840
Loki.

3250
02:29:07,780 --> 02:29:12,660
I know I'm going to talk to you about shortages and you know which company I'm talking about

3251
02:29:12,660 --> 02:29:16,100
already when I say there's going to be a shortage of something.

3252
02:29:16,100 --> 02:29:17,540
It's obviously Nintendo.

3253
02:29:18,100 --> 02:29:22,820
And what did Nintendo not realize that they're going to have enough copies of?

3254
02:29:22,820 --> 02:29:26,580
Well of course it's going to be the brand new Piranha Plant amiibo.

3255
02:29:26,580 --> 02:29:30,580
It is sold out pretty much at every retailer in Japan.

3256
02:29:31,140 --> 02:29:36,820
And which I guess the figure doesn't even come out until February 15th of next year.

3257
02:29:36,820 --> 02:29:43,220
But they've already sold out of it and it's very hard to find apparently.

3258
02:29:43,220 --> 02:29:45,140
And one way you can possibly get it.

3259
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:49,860
Well of course with all these deals online, Cyber Monday and whatnot.

3260
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:56,100
December 7th there's going to be a limited box set of 63 amiibos.

3261
02:29:56,100 --> 02:30:00,820
All of the amiibos that I'm assuming that appear in the new Smash Brothers game.

3262
02:30:01,620 --> 02:30:02,900
And you can purchase that.

3263
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:06,740
But there's only 50 of them and you can get that at Amazon Japan.

3264
02:30:06,740 --> 02:30:08,020
It comes with a box and a poster.

3265
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:10,420
It's a little excessive.

3266
02:30:10,420 --> 02:30:12,100
I don't think I need that.

3267
02:30:12,100 --> 02:30:16,260
I'm surprised to hear Piranha Plant is like crazy popular as it is though.

3268
02:30:17,540 --> 02:30:20,820
When they first announced it I was like alright cool I guess.

3269
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:23,460
There's other characters I would have put in the game.

3270
02:30:24,100 --> 02:30:26,660
Birdo, Wart, anything from Mario 2.

3271
02:30:26,660 --> 02:30:28,820
But Piranha Plant okay whatever go off.

3272
02:30:30,260 --> 02:30:32,580
I don't know I mean I guess we'll have to wait and see.

3273
02:30:32,580 --> 02:30:34,420
I think you know just give it more time.

3274
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:37,780
I mean they're just I can't imagine they run too short of these amiibos.

3275
02:30:37,780 --> 02:30:41,860
It's not that it's just a damn plastic figure with an RFID.

3276
02:30:42,740 --> 02:30:45,380
Maybe because amiibos have been kind of slipping a little bit.

3277
02:30:45,380 --> 02:30:47,300
Maybe the underestimated demand.

3278
02:30:47,300 --> 02:30:47,860
You know what I mean?

3279
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:48,740
They still got time.

3280
02:30:48,740 --> 02:30:52,340
I mean we're talking about a thing that comes out in February.

3281
02:30:52,340 --> 02:30:54,180
So I mean they have time to make more.

3282
02:30:54,180 --> 02:30:54,980
Get on it.

3283
02:30:54,980 --> 02:30:55,480
All right.

3284
02:30:56,420 --> 02:31:01,780
Rumors but we'll do it because it's coming from a reliable tech website called Throt.

3285
02:31:02,420 --> 02:31:05,940
And then via Eurogamer where we showed up on our radar.

3286
02:31:05,940 --> 02:31:10,660
But Microsoft is apparently going to be launching a diskless version of the Xbox One

3287
02:31:10,660 --> 02:31:12,180
in spring 2019.

3288
02:31:12,180 --> 02:31:14,820
I also bring this up because this topic has come up before.

3289
02:31:14,820 --> 02:31:15,620
Several times.

3290
02:31:15,620 --> 02:31:19,940
This is a little deja vu but it's only gaining more and more steam.

3291
02:31:19,940 --> 02:31:22,420
Which makes it look more and more true.

3292
02:31:22,420 --> 02:31:23,860
So get used to this idea.

3293
02:31:23,860 --> 02:31:27,220
I mean I'd have to see how much cheaper it would be but I don't know.

3294
02:31:27,220 --> 02:31:29,620
Yeah well we'll see.

3295
02:31:29,620 --> 02:31:32,660
Anyway the next gen Xbox is supposed to be in 2020.

3296
02:31:32,660 --> 02:31:35,300
So this is a little bit kind of like a bridge.

3297
02:31:35,300 --> 02:31:37,220
The code name for this device is Scarlet.

3298
02:31:37,780 --> 02:31:41,060
They're saying it's going to be sold substantially lower than it is now.

3299
02:31:41,060 --> 02:31:44,500
It could be as low as a hundred dollars cheaper.

3300
02:31:45,380 --> 02:31:49,620
Pushing it at I guess under two hundred dollars US dollars.

3301
02:31:50,820 --> 02:31:55,300
So I mean if they could get the price to a hundred dollars.

3302
02:31:55,300 --> 02:31:57,380
I know that's asking a lot but that would be insane.

3303
02:31:57,380 --> 02:32:01,860
Because like the Xbox One S was selling for 199 I think this week.

3304
02:32:02,580 --> 02:32:04,340
You know during Black Friday and stuff.

3305
02:32:04,340 --> 02:32:10,180
So you're thinking they need to get it down to like 149 to make it really.

3306
02:32:10,180 --> 02:32:13,140
So Black Friday has kind of screwed perceptions in that regard.

3307
02:32:13,140 --> 02:32:17,700
I mean I want to say yeah because yeah because they had yeah it was starting at 199.

3308
02:32:17,700 --> 02:32:20,100
And they had like a game bundle and stuff like that.

3309
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:24,820
So it's just I don't want the S if I'm going to buy a system it's going to be yeah.

3310
02:32:24,820 --> 02:32:29,700
Because they have the Minecraft one terabyte Minecraft creators bundle is 199.

3311
02:32:29,700 --> 02:32:34,340
So they came with Minecraft and like some in-game currency and some other skins and stuff.

3312
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:40,420
And then they had the Xbox One X for like 399.

3313
02:32:42,180 --> 02:32:47,780
Also Microsoft is apparently considering disk to digital which I feel like we've heard this one too.

3314
02:32:47,780 --> 02:32:50,420
Meaning you can trade in a physical game in return for a digital

3315
02:32:50,420 --> 02:32:52,420
download at certain participating retailers.

3316
02:32:52,420 --> 02:32:56,900
That's kind of a big deal if that's really the case.

3317
02:32:57,700 --> 02:33:00,100
That would be really the first of its kind to do that.

3318
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:00,820
To trade it in.

3319
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:04,500
And then I would assume that the company would be able to resell it.

3320
02:33:04,500 --> 02:33:08,020
But how would you stop it for just getting traded back in over and over?

3321
02:33:08,020 --> 02:33:10,340
Well I guess they don't give you as much money.

3322
02:33:10,340 --> 02:33:12,180
You probably have to still pay some type of money or something.

3323
02:33:12,180 --> 02:33:13,460
Probably some sort of redemption.

3324
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:17,140
It would be like for the retailer where they'd have to

3325
02:33:17,140 --> 02:33:19,380
send it back to Microsoft to be destroyed or whatever.

3326
02:33:19,380 --> 02:33:19,700
Maybe.

3327
02:33:20,260 --> 02:33:21,380
I don't know it'll be interesting.

3328
02:33:21,380 --> 02:33:27,140
Um, rumors still swelling about the next console.

3329
02:33:27,140 --> 02:33:29,540
And whether it will have a disk drive or not.

3330
02:33:29,540 --> 02:33:33,940
The next gen of Xbox may go diskless which deja vu.

3331
02:33:33,940 --> 02:33:36,100
There was controversy at the beginning of Xbox One.

3332
02:33:36,100 --> 02:33:36,900
It should still have a drive.

3333
02:33:37,860 --> 02:33:42,580
People, speculation is that that's where Microsoft will ultimately fall.

3334
02:33:42,580 --> 02:33:44,900
Is that the next console will still have a drive.

3335
02:33:45,540 --> 02:33:49,540
But I don't think it would be as damning as it was this last time.

3336
02:33:49,620 --> 02:33:52,420
Because more and more people are going to why it's not necessary.

3337
02:33:52,420 --> 02:33:56,820
And I I'm on the fence like I purchased most of my stuff digitally.

3338
02:33:56,820 --> 02:33:57,860
And yeah I get it.

3339
02:33:57,860 --> 02:34:04,580
You know it's but then again I just got an Xbox or not an Xbox PlayStation 4 Pro.

3340
02:34:04,580 --> 02:34:09,140
And so a lot of the like I haven't really been downloading a lot of the 4k content.

3341
02:34:09,140 --> 02:34:16,900
So for me like I would think one of the draws I with the 4k um like a ultra HD Blu-ray drive

3342
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:22,500
would be you know I would want to have those on disk versus downloading that stuff.

3343
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:26,740
Because that's several you know gigabytes worth of data for movies.

3344
02:34:26,740 --> 02:34:29,540
And the hard drives that are in these you know like one terabyte.

3345
02:34:30,580 --> 02:34:33,300
It's all right for now but that's going to fill up really fast.

3346
02:34:33,300 --> 02:34:38,660
Especially when you have games like Fallout 76 with like oh hey it's a 4k textures.

3347
02:34:38,660 --> 02:34:40,820
Like yeah are like 90 gigabyte games.

3348
02:34:40,820 --> 02:34:46,100
So unless you like start plopping like 50 or like five terabyte drives in there.

3349
02:34:46,740 --> 02:34:53,860
And you know convince all the internet providers to not give me a you know download cap.

3350
02:34:53,860 --> 02:34:56,260
Then then yeah maybe that might work.

3351
02:34:56,260 --> 02:35:02,660
But I think until technology elsewhere catches up you're going to have to include a drive in there.

3352
02:35:02,660 --> 02:35:06,580
Like well it may be that you're skewing more towards digital downloads.

3353
02:35:06,580 --> 02:35:07,380
That's cool.

3354
02:35:07,380 --> 02:35:09,380
That's more money in your pocket honestly.

3355
02:35:09,380 --> 02:35:14,900
Because you're not having to sell you know physical copies of retailers and take a cut out of it.

3356
02:35:14,900 --> 02:35:20,340
But at the same time that's still going to be a part of it.

3357
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:22,820
I mean and I'm I'm still going to buy physical games.

3358
02:35:22,820 --> 02:35:25,780
Especially if I find out like oh hey I've got to download like

3359
02:35:26,740 --> 02:35:29,780
100 gigabytes that's going to be on the disk or something like that.

3360
02:35:29,780 --> 02:35:32,100
And I don't I don't think anyone should like you know freak out.

3361
02:35:32,100 --> 02:35:33,620
Because again these are rumors.

3362
02:35:33,620 --> 02:35:37,380
But I think this is exactly the type of conversation Microsoft is trying to feel out.

3363
02:35:37,380 --> 02:35:41,780
Like is the gamer base ready to be diskless or do we still need to kind of have the disk.

3364
02:35:41,780 --> 02:35:43,780
And I think I think ultimately they will fall on the side.

3365
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:48,260
I don't think it would be like I mean honestly like I don't watch a lot Ultra HD content

3366
02:35:49,140 --> 02:35:51,780
yet because I don't have anything that will play it.

3367
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:57,940
I mean I could get digital copies for my PlayStation 4 but I just don't want to buy those.

3368
02:35:57,940 --> 02:35:58,440
Yeah.

3369
02:35:58,980 --> 02:35:59,780
So I don't know.

3370
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:01,060
All right well let's move on.

3371
02:36:02,340 --> 02:36:05,220
Since Microsoft's got a clear shot next E3 we'll see.

3372
02:36:05,780 --> 02:36:06,280
Yeah.

3373
02:36:06,580 --> 02:36:13,300
So apparently there is UK commission that was looking at gambling in games.

3374
02:36:14,340 --> 02:36:20,100
So they're put out a report that talked about loot boxes.

3375
02:36:20,100 --> 02:36:23,620
And you know according to the commission says the gambling commissions

3376
02:36:23,620 --> 02:36:28,020
takes the view of the ability to convert in-game items to cash

3377
02:36:28,580 --> 02:36:34,180
or to trade them for other items of value means that they attain a real world value

3378
02:36:34,180 --> 02:36:37,220
and become articles of money or money's worth.

3379
02:36:37,220 --> 02:36:43,140
Whereas gambling facilitates or facilities are offered to British consumers

3380
02:36:43,140 --> 02:36:48,420
including with those with the use of in-game or in-game items

3381
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:53,780
that can be converted in the cash or traded for items value a gambling license is required.

3382
02:36:53,780 --> 02:36:58,980
So they do see these loot boxes as you know gambling.

3383
02:36:58,980 --> 02:37:02,580
And even with that they said you know that they found that that 39 percent

3384
02:37:02,580 --> 02:37:10,020
of UK children 11 to 16 spend their or have spent their own money gambling.

3385
02:37:10,020 --> 02:37:12,500
14 percent had done so within the last week.

3386
02:37:13,620 --> 02:37:23,060
They said that the average amount spent during that time was 16 looks like 16 60 or 16 euro.

3387
02:37:23,060 --> 02:37:29,780
And then 60 percent of young people believe that their parents would wouldn't want them gambling.

3388
02:37:29,780 --> 02:37:33,220
19 percent claimed that they guardians had strict rules against gambling.

3389
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:38,180
So they're actually talking about like actually gambling gambling not necessarily

3390
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:40,420
that they purchase loot boxes or something like that.

3391
02:37:40,420 --> 02:37:44,820
But they see that because of this being more prevalent in games.

3392
02:37:44,820 --> 02:37:49,060
There's a correlation with gambling going up you know.

3393
02:37:51,940 --> 02:37:56,100
So it's it's interesting to see that and I think with other companies like you know

3394
02:37:56,980 --> 02:38:02,500
Belgium whatever blocking some of these we interest to see how it goes.

3395
02:38:02,500 --> 02:38:06,500
And I know that like some of these companies like EA have said well we're just not comply

3396
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:12,020
with the laws you know you block it we're just not going to do it which makes you think you know like

3397
02:38:13,460 --> 02:38:17,460
wow they're really they're willing to break the law to sell this stuff.

3398
02:38:18,020 --> 02:38:22,340
I mean that's a lot because they're still convinced in their mind that it's not

3399
02:38:22,340 --> 02:38:24,100
what these companies are saying it is.

3400
02:38:24,100 --> 02:38:26,260
They're going to have to get dragged to court to stop doing.

3401
02:38:26,260 --> 02:38:28,100
Yeah it's just like ultimately they'll just stop releasing.

3402
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:31,060
It's just like cigarette companies saying that cigarettes weren't addictive.

3403
02:38:31,060 --> 02:38:32,660
I mean come on it's the same thing.

3404
02:38:32,660 --> 02:38:33,860
They know what they're doing.

3405
02:38:33,860 --> 02:38:35,700
So it's just I don't know.

3406
02:38:36,820 --> 02:38:37,620
All right.

3407
02:38:37,620 --> 02:38:42,340
Well while we wait to see what shapes up with that legally moving on to a lot of talk about

3408
02:38:42,340 --> 02:38:46,660
accessibility in the gaming industry this week as there's been several different reports kind

3409
02:38:46,660 --> 02:38:52,020
of concerning accessibility with some recent titles including the Spyro Reignited trilogy.

3410
02:38:52,580 --> 02:39:01,700
Apparently it does lack subtitles in the Spyro Reignited trilogy and there are no subtitles.

3411
02:39:01,700 --> 02:39:06,340
So you know people that you need to rely on subtitles are a little bit irritated about this.

3412
02:39:06,340 --> 02:39:07,380
I'd like to use subtitles.

3413
02:39:07,380 --> 02:39:09,620
At least that's something that they could probably patch in.

3414
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:10,900
So that's not such a big deal.

3415
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:14,020
Yeah but it is also one of the things they shouldn't have to patch.

3416
02:39:14,020 --> 02:39:15,460
It shouldn't have done it out the gate right.

3417
02:39:15,460 --> 02:39:19,380
But yeah I even like I don't consider myself

3418
02:39:20,100 --> 02:39:23,220
disabled when it comes to like needing the subtitles.

3419
02:39:23,220 --> 02:39:27,780
But like I'm definitely like because I get really distracted by like background noise.

3420
02:39:27,780 --> 02:39:30,820
Like if I'm in a restaurant or something I have to really focus on

3421
02:39:30,820 --> 02:39:32,660
who's talking to me and what they're saying.

3422
02:39:32,660 --> 02:39:36,020
Because a lot of times I will get so easily distracted by noise around me.

3423
02:39:36,020 --> 02:39:38,180
Like I'm not necessarily like trying to eavesdrop on conversations.

3424
02:39:38,180 --> 02:39:41,060
But like I can't like I just I can't focus on one conversation.

3425
02:39:41,060 --> 02:39:42,740
It's what happens the background noise.

3426
02:39:42,740 --> 02:39:47,380
So sometimes with like even playing games and stuff like that.

3427
02:39:47,380 --> 02:39:49,860
Like all of that other noise gets in the way of the dialogue.

3428
02:39:49,860 --> 02:39:51,220
And I have a hard time understanding.

3429
02:39:51,220 --> 02:39:53,140
So I prefer to play with subtitles.

3430
02:39:53,140 --> 02:39:55,780
I actually prefer to watch movies with closed captions too.

3431
02:39:56,660 --> 02:40:00,660
I will go to the theater and watch them without and be all right.

3432
02:40:00,660 --> 02:40:03,140
But I prefer when I'm at home to watch with closed captions.

3433
02:40:03,140 --> 02:40:05,300
And you know some people get really annoyed with that.

3434
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:07,140
Because it's like when you're just reading them.

3435
02:40:07,140 --> 02:40:11,620
But I'm sorry it's just like I miss too much shit if I don't have it on.

3436
02:40:11,620 --> 02:40:14,260
Yeah so and I do this with games.

3437
02:40:14,260 --> 02:40:17,140
I far prefer to have the subtitles on in games.

3438
02:40:17,620 --> 02:40:25,540
So yeah anyway apparently Activision did provide a statement to the blog Game Pit.

3439
02:40:25,540 --> 02:40:29,060
Who said when Toys for Bob set out to make an awesome game collection.

3440
02:40:29,060 --> 02:40:31,780
There were certain decisions that needed to be made throughout the process.

3441
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:36,500
The team remained committed to keep the integrity and legacy of Spyro that fans remembered intact.

3442
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:38,660
While there's no industry standard for subtitles.

3443
02:40:38,660 --> 02:40:41,140
The studio and Activision care about the fans experience.

3444
02:40:41,140 --> 02:40:44,580
Especially with respect to accessibility for people with different abilities.

3445
02:40:44,580 --> 02:40:46,180
And will evaluate going forward.

3446
02:40:47,620 --> 02:40:50,020
Kind of a shit answer in my opinion.

3447
02:40:50,020 --> 02:40:52,260
They're trying to say well since the first game didn't have subtitles.

3448
02:40:52,820 --> 02:40:54,260
That's kind of like what they're saying basically.

3449
02:40:54,980 --> 02:40:56,420
Kind of a shit answer.

3450
02:40:56,420 --> 02:40:58,260
I think that could have been worded a lot better.

3451
02:40:58,260 --> 02:41:03,140
Just basically like instead they could have just kind of fessed up and said.

3452
02:41:03,140 --> 02:41:06,820
You know since we they weren't in the original game.

3453
02:41:06,820 --> 02:41:08,900
And we remastered the first game.

3454
02:41:08,900 --> 02:41:10,420
We neglected to include it.

3455
02:41:10,420 --> 02:41:12,340
But we are looking to include it in the future.

3456
02:41:12,340 --> 02:41:14,900
To make sure that our games are as accessible as possible.

3457
02:41:14,900 --> 02:41:17,380
I think there could have been a better way they could have worded that.

3458
02:41:17,380 --> 02:41:20,580
Maybe took a little bit of ownership.

3459
02:41:20,580 --> 02:41:24,260
But they did not with that statement in my humble opinion.

3460
02:41:25,220 --> 02:41:27,220
SSJ100Matt agrees with me in chat.

3461
02:41:27,220 --> 02:41:28,180
That is a shit answer.

3462
02:41:29,060 --> 02:41:32,180
Anyway also Pokemon Let's Go.

3463
02:41:32,180 --> 02:41:34,900
Getting some pushback on the motion controls.

3464
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:37,300
Because the motion controls in the game are mandatory.

3465
02:41:37,300 --> 02:41:40,660
So of course that means that players with certain disabilities can't play.

3466
02:41:41,220 --> 02:41:44,500
I have only been playing with the Joy-Con to like throw the ball.

3467
02:41:44,580 --> 02:41:48,020
I have not played in portable mode at all.

3468
02:41:48,020 --> 02:41:49,540
I have played all in portable mode.

3469
02:41:49,540 --> 02:41:50,420
That's so interesting.

3470
02:41:50,420 --> 02:41:54,180
Because to me I think that's one of the reasons why I love this game.

3471
02:41:54,180 --> 02:41:55,940
More than like any other Pokemon game.

3472
02:41:55,940 --> 02:41:58,740
Is because I can play it on the fucking television finally.

3473
02:41:59,380 --> 02:42:00,900
And that means a lot for me.

3474
02:42:00,900 --> 02:42:02,660
So I like to play with the motion controls.

3475
02:42:02,660 --> 02:42:04,420
But regardless of how I feel.

3476
02:42:05,060 --> 02:42:09,620
There's you know some gamers out there that are are not able to do that motion.

3477
02:42:09,620 --> 02:42:11,140
Or the gyro motion.

3478
02:42:11,140 --> 02:42:14,180
I'm gonna throw in a few life hacks here for you for Pokemon.

3479
02:42:14,740 --> 02:42:15,620
Let's go as well.

3480
02:42:15,620 --> 02:42:16,020
All right.

3481
02:42:16,020 --> 02:42:19,060
So here's some fun little cheats or stuff you can do.

3482
02:42:19,060 --> 02:42:25,060
So because in the game you can have anybody join up with you with your Pokemon at any time.

3483
02:42:25,060 --> 02:42:28,420
You can actually when you're fighting trainers and stuff like that.

3484
02:42:28,420 --> 02:42:30,340
And you find a difficult battle.

3485
02:42:30,340 --> 02:42:32,660
You activate the other controller by shaking it.

3486
02:42:32,660 --> 02:42:35,700
Then you get to have two Pokemon out at once versus their one.

3487
02:42:37,700 --> 02:42:38,580
At the same time.

3488
02:42:38,900 --> 02:42:40,900
Hmm so anyway.

3489
02:42:41,780 --> 02:42:43,220
Apparently yeah.

3490
02:42:44,100 --> 02:42:48,020
Because you have to use some of the gyro even when you're in portable mode.

3491
02:42:48,020 --> 02:42:48,580
Yeah you do.

3492
02:42:48,580 --> 02:42:52,420
It sucks for people that can't like pick that up and hold it and do the whole thing.

3493
02:42:52,420 --> 02:42:55,780
So you know Nintendo's kind of getting called out on that a little bit.

3494
02:42:56,580 --> 02:42:59,220
But there's also some positive examples.

3495
02:42:59,220 --> 02:43:01,460
Eurogamer kind of spotlighted amongst all this.

3496
02:43:02,180 --> 02:43:07,300
Spider-Man PlayStation 4 has a lot of great accessibility features in it.

3497
02:43:07,300 --> 02:43:10,260
For example you can you know change things like parallaxing.

3498
02:43:10,260 --> 02:43:12,020
You can make subtitles gigantic.

3499
02:43:12,580 --> 02:43:14,980
You can do quick time events that auto complete.

3500
02:43:14,980 --> 02:43:18,260
You can change button taps to hold like you can really break it down.

3501
02:43:18,260 --> 02:43:22,500
And other games have been called out for doing accessibility right.

3502
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:27,140
God of War, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Celeste are all games that really kind of go out of

3503
02:43:27,140 --> 02:43:29,540
their way to be more and more accessible.

3504
02:43:29,540 --> 02:43:34,100
So you know certainly something I think we just need to be thinking about developing

3505
02:43:34,100 --> 02:43:37,860
games is how can as many people as possible play this game.

3506
02:43:37,860 --> 02:43:38,820
You know what I mean.

3507
02:43:38,820 --> 02:43:42,180
There's I think it's going to be tough like when it comes to things like VR.

3508
02:43:42,900 --> 02:43:46,020
Like some people just aren't going to be able to do VR period.

3509
02:43:46,020 --> 02:43:47,300
Yeah you know what I mean.

3510
02:43:47,300 --> 02:43:52,420
So it's it's tough like you have to kind of ask these hard questions about well you know

3511
02:43:52,420 --> 02:43:55,780
how how far can we go to actually be able to include people.

3512
02:43:55,780 --> 02:44:00,580
You know in like a game like Beat Saber it's going to be very very very hard to make inclusive.

3513
02:44:01,220 --> 02:44:01,780
You know what I mean.

3514
02:44:02,580 --> 02:44:05,540
But I think again you just kind of have to put the question in the back of your mind.

3515
02:44:06,580 --> 02:44:11,300
How can we easily incorporate as many people as possible to be able to enjoy this game.

3516
02:44:11,300 --> 02:44:12,820
And subtitles come on.

3517
02:44:12,820 --> 02:44:14,180
That's an easy thing.

3518
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:15,540
Like that's super easy.

3519
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:20,580
Button remapping that should be like a non-issue easy easy peasy thing which is why it's built

3520
02:44:20,580 --> 02:44:22,900
into PlayStation firmware at this point right.

3521
02:44:22,900 --> 02:44:24,500
You know so anyway.

3522
02:44:25,380 --> 02:44:27,140
All right well let's move on.

3523
02:44:27,140 --> 02:44:29,780
We got a couple more stories for you guys that we're going to open up the Skype line

3524
02:44:29,780 --> 02:44:32,820
if anyone wants to call in at Orange Lounge Radio.

3525
02:44:33,380 --> 02:44:35,620
But first Loki.

3526
02:44:35,620 --> 02:44:37,780
We've got new Half-Life coming out.

3527
02:44:37,780 --> 02:44:39,300
Fan-made Half-Life of course.

3528
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:45,140
So there was a whole remake of the original Half-Life called Black Mesa which came out

3529
02:44:45,140 --> 02:44:46,020
not too long ago.

3530
02:44:46,660 --> 02:44:54,260
And of course with that there was still the last part of the game which is set on the

3531
02:44:54,260 --> 02:44:55,380
Alien World of Xen.

3532
02:44:55,940 --> 02:45:01,220
So now the Black Mesa team has released a trailer for Black Mesa Xen which is going

3533
02:45:01,220 --> 02:45:07,540
to be the final chapter of the game which is set to be released around the second quarter

3534
02:45:07,540 --> 02:45:08,340
of next year.

3535
02:45:08,340 --> 02:45:09,540
And it looks fantastic.

3536
02:45:10,260 --> 02:45:11,380
It looks so great.

3537
02:45:12,100 --> 02:45:19,620
So you know since it's largely original work it says it'll run for about six hours and

3538
02:45:19,620 --> 02:45:20,340
very colorful.

3539
02:45:20,340 --> 02:45:27,540
I will have to ask Alan if he plans to play that because he you know he'll visit the Half-Life

3540
02:45:27,540 --> 02:45:28,820
series about once a year or so.

3541
02:45:28,820 --> 02:45:29,860
He's still on his Dark Souls.

3542
02:45:29,860 --> 02:45:31,300
I'm sure he's played Black Mesa.

3543
02:45:31,300 --> 02:45:35,540
Oh he has he has but if they're gonna like finally do that you know last sequence and

3544
02:45:35,540 --> 02:45:37,780
everything he'll probably go back and revisit so.

3545
02:45:37,780 --> 02:45:39,060
Yeah it looks pretty amazing.

3546
02:45:39,060 --> 02:45:43,940
Yeah and then last but certainly not least tonight I mean this is one of those things

3547
02:45:43,940 --> 02:45:48,260
where hello I think everybody heard this news already but we have to mention of course at

3548
02:45:48,260 --> 02:45:54,100
some point that Stan Lee who you know contributed so much to nerd culture you know obviously

3549
02:45:54,100 --> 02:45:58,980
through Marvel Comics which of course expanded into the video game universe did pass away

3550
02:45:58,980 --> 02:46:01,780
while we were out on break at the age of 95.

3551
02:46:02,500 --> 02:46:09,460
So he did pass away on Monday the what was the date the 20th just right after I think

3552
02:46:09,460 --> 02:46:10,500
the last Orange Lounge Radio.

3553
02:46:11,140 --> 02:46:17,940
He passed away it was November 12th I think was the day and he was 95 years old though

3554
02:46:17,940 --> 02:46:22,980
so what an amazing life I think many of us would be so fortunate to lead such an amazing

3555
02:46:22,980 --> 02:46:23,620
life.

3556
02:46:23,620 --> 02:46:28,420
Stan Lee of course behind heroes like Spider-Man the Fantastic Four the Incredible Hulk and

3557
02:46:28,420 --> 02:46:32,660
so on and you know he did do a lot for video games as well.

3558
02:46:32,660 --> 02:46:38,260
It's not you know just certainly Marvel or not just comics because Spider-Man's PlayStation

3559
02:46:38,260 --> 02:46:41,540
4 games he made appearances in Lego Marvel series.

3560
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:44,820
He showed up in the amazing Spider-Man Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

3561
02:46:44,820 --> 02:46:49,700
He actually made a cameo in DC Teen Titans goes yeah the movie believe it was hilarious.

3562
02:46:49,700 --> 02:46:54,020
So I mean that's cool that you know you can you know you have a little little love between

3563
02:46:54,020 --> 02:46:59,700
you know the fact that he had a well he had a cameo but it wasn't like a spoken cameo

3564
02:46:59,700 --> 02:47:02,020
it was just kind of like a little easter egg they threw in there.

3565
02:47:02,020 --> 02:47:08,740
Yeah so anyhow it was it was video games as well as music and I'm sure is music as well

3566
02:47:08,740 --> 02:47:16,180
as comics and movies and yeah I'm sure a lot of folks very sad to hear that but again

3567
02:47:16,180 --> 02:47:21,220
95 what a wonderful long great life and I know many people had seen him at conventions

3568
02:47:21,220 --> 02:47:24,100
he was doing those conventions man right up to the last year.

3569
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:28,500
I remember he was at Dragon Con just a couple years ago he had a he had a floor auto himself

3570
02:47:28,500 --> 02:47:32,740
at Dragon Con but when you're Stan Lee that's what you get so rest in peace Stan Lee.

3571
02:47:33,540 --> 02:47:37,940
Let's open up the skype line Orange Lounge Radio all one word on skype if you want to

3572
02:47:37,940 --> 02:47:41,060
give us a call if there's something we haven't talked about on the show yet or maybe something

Oh Alan is it's ready it's fully ready so anyhow while we wait to see if anything oh

3578
02:48:04,340 --> 02:48:06,420
Hello you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

3579
02:48:06,420 --> 02:48:09,140
That's the one and only Ron how is everybody tonight?

3580
02:48:09,140 --> 02:48:10,500
Hey I'm great how are you doing?

3581
02:48:11,140 --> 02:48:14,980
Pretty good after a little chaos during Black Friday sales I can't complain.

3582
02:48:15,780 --> 02:48:19,460
Yeah you know I didn't go out there I mean I went out to go play video games but I didn't

3583
02:48:19,460 --> 02:48:24,180
I didn't fight any of the traffic at malls or things like that on Black Friday I just kind of

3584
02:48:24,180 --> 02:48:29,300
I kind of uh it was a normal day for well I had to work on Black Friday I don't even I don't work

3585
02:48:29,300 --> 02:48:34,740
retail or any of that stuff I mean you brave souls that do uh but I work an office job but

3586
02:48:34,740 --> 02:48:37,780
just the nature of my industry we had to be open on Friday so.

3587
02:48:37,780 --> 02:48:40,340
Well that's understandable so I get that.

3588
02:48:40,340 --> 02:48:43,700
So it's just another day for me but how was how was your weekend adventure with

3589
02:48:43,700 --> 02:48:44,820
all that getting any good deals?

3590
02:48:45,700 --> 02:48:49,460
Uh that's Spider-Man PlayStation 4 for $200 my dude.

3591
02:48:49,460 --> 02:48:51,780
So how are you liking PlayStation 4?

3592
02:48:52,820 --> 02:48:59,060
I just hooked it up it's as it's updating you open the Skype license I kind of did a backflip

3593
02:48:59,060 --> 02:49:00,820
from my TV over to the chair.

3594
02:49:02,660 --> 02:49:04,420
So a little too early to tell huh?

3595
02:49:04,980 --> 02:49:09,620
Yes despite the drama behind me getting it I I'm good.

3596
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:14,580
Um so you picked up not just the Spider-Man that's included right but I saw because you

3597
02:49:14,580 --> 02:49:18,020
you gave me a shout out on Twitter thank you because you picked up Tetris Effect right?

3598
02:49:18,020 --> 02:49:18,820
Yes I did.

3599
02:49:18,820 --> 02:49:22,980
Yeah well and where's my kickback from enhanced games where's that all right uh and then you

3600
02:49:22,980 --> 02:49:25,940
picked up one other thing too right the Kingdom Hearts thing right?

3601
02:49:25,940 --> 02:49:30,340
And I actually traded in the Spider-Man game and got um Dragon Quest 11.

3602
02:49:31,220 --> 02:49:34,260
That's fun oh so you didn't even want the Spider-Man game?

3603
02:49:35,620 --> 02:49:39,140
For giving me reasons I'm like you have to understand something.

3604
02:49:39,140 --> 02:49:45,780
I have a very eclectic taste in video games like I can't stand a lot of RTS type games

3605
02:49:45,780 --> 02:49:50,820
but I can sit there and play Command and Conquer the Age of Series the Project Crow I can sit

3606
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:55,380
there play those all day I'll stare at Final Fantasy Tactics go two rounds like I'm done

3607
02:49:55,380 --> 02:49:59,140
with this all right very eclectic taste.

3608
02:49:59,140 --> 02:50:03,380
That's why I consider myself pretty eclectic when it comes to games too but you know there's

3609
02:50:03,380 --> 02:50:07,140
certain things that I'm just never gonna gel with like Call of Duty but even then like

3610
02:50:07,140 --> 02:50:09,220
I watch other people play it and I go this is pretty.

3611
02:50:09,940 --> 02:50:13,620
I will sit there and play Battlefield I picked up Battlefield because it was free I'm like

3612
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:18,180
I won't pay $60 for it I might pay $10 but you know free free is free.

3613
02:50:18,180 --> 02:50:18,900
Yeah free is free.

3614
02:50:20,740 --> 02:50:26,020
I didn't want to go on about uh my PS4 I'm just here to back up a lot of what you said

3615
02:50:26,020 --> 02:50:32,660
about E3 okay I'm walking home I'm screaming to the world that you are preaching the gospel

3616
02:50:32,660 --> 02:50:38,340
about E3 and PAX and all of that I'm like this is part of the reason why I stopped going to PAX.

3617
02:50:39,220 --> 02:50:43,460
And you care to elaborate what do you what do you think I got right on this?

3618
02:50:44,180 --> 02:50:51,220
It's not fun anymore PAX was fan run now it's industry run I have heard from people that

3619
02:50:51,220 --> 02:50:57,780
you can't get as much free swag anymore it's harder to get badges it's more of a glorified

3620
02:50:57,780 --> 02:51:04,020
dealers hall than anything else I mean with the way technology is going the fact that Sony's

3621
02:51:04,020 --> 02:51:08,900
off doing their own thing it's not surprising everybody else is plus the fact that you have

3622
02:51:08,900 --> 02:51:13,860
like smaller gaming conventions popping up and indie companies are going to and sometimes you

3623
02:51:13,860 --> 02:51:19,940
might find a third-party company going to showing stuff off and also let's say there is this awesome

3624
02:51:19,940 --> 02:51:26,260
game coming out at E3 and you have to be one of the elite few to try it out you ain't got to worry

3625
02:51:26,260 --> 02:51:33,700
about that because if you wait a few weeks that company Sony EA whoever will be at New York comic

3626
02:51:33,700 --> 02:51:38,340
con with the game and you can hop on the line and play it then or this convention where you can hop

3627
02:51:38,340 --> 02:51:42,100
on the line and play it then or you just watch it all on YouTube we don't even have to wait at all.

3628
02:51:43,220 --> 02:51:50,660
Exactly I mean I had a friend who was all hyped about going to E3 last year she hasn't mentioned

3629
02:51:50,660 --> 02:51:57,060
anything about going this year because even though they opened it up to the general public

3630
02:51:57,060 --> 02:52:03,940
a lot of convention goers are not used to have E3 runs yes I'm gonna go to like comic cons

3631
02:52:03,940 --> 02:52:10,340
and and other stuff where it kind of closes at eight you saw panels going on like 10 o'clock

3632
02:52:10,340 --> 02:52:18,580
oh yeah but E3 there really is no panels it's just rows of demos and other stuff and then it's over

3633
02:52:18,580 --> 02:52:22,820
you can find your friends or see if you can get into an industry party or something like that

3634
02:52:22,820 --> 02:52:27,860
you know even this Final Fantasy thing was over at six o'clock Friday and Saturday so it was

3635
02:52:27,860 --> 02:52:31,380
no more like eight o'clock because the concerts but still kind of left that whole evening where

3636
02:52:31,380 --> 02:52:34,500
it's like well what do we do now oh well at least we're in Las Vegas and we can hang with

3637
02:52:34,500 --> 02:52:40,660
our guildies you know what I mean so there's that so you know I do I do want to point out

3638
02:52:40,660 --> 02:52:46,340
though just just to be clear you know you know the moment when E3 I kind of had my aha moment about

3639
02:52:46,340 --> 02:52:50,100
I'm not sure this is worth the money to come down here and take off work for this anymore you know

3640
02:52:50,100 --> 02:52:56,500
when the moment was well it was the year the last year I went when we were basically we had to

3641
02:52:56,500 --> 02:53:03,140
justify ourselves as a legitimate press outlet to get tickets to this Assassin's Creed theater

3642
02:53:03,140 --> 02:53:10,020
experience wait in line once we have tickets to get in the Assassin's Creed thing finally watch

3643
02:53:10,020 --> 02:53:14,340
the thing which looked neat I was you know I'm not even a huge Assassin's Creed person and I was like

3644
02:53:14,340 --> 02:53:20,980
oh I was into it and then come to find out the whole thing's on YouTube already so that thing I

3645
02:53:20,980 --> 02:53:26,340
had to fight and wait in line for it was just there on YouTube going to see it Rob you see it

3646
02:53:26,340 --> 02:53:31,780
right now but I'm rolling my eyes so hard in the back of my head about that I'm like are you fucking

3647
02:53:31,780 --> 02:53:37,780
kidding but that's that's the reality of you know a big piece of where E3 kind of lost its luster

3648
02:53:37,780 --> 02:53:42,260
where I'm like again if I could just watch this on YouTube why am I coming down here to spend all

3649
02:53:42,260 --> 02:53:49,220
this money you know it's that's what it is and the fact that it's just crowds and you know I

3650
02:53:49,220 --> 02:53:57,060
already said it if I have to take personal time off to sit in front of my computer to get my

3651
02:53:57,060 --> 02:54:05,460
tickets my hotel rooms if I gotta get a squad together to do that that's it to me the convention

3652
02:54:05,460 --> 02:54:12,900
is not worth going through that for I refuse yeah so and Bobby kind of says in chat you know kind

3653
02:54:12,900 --> 02:54:17,380
of a hits home type of comment I gave up on E3 when they told me I wasn't legit anymore even

3654
02:54:17,380 --> 02:54:22,340
with my LLC in my audience I got tired of fighting Pax said the same thing to me and I gave up on them

3655
02:54:22,340 --> 02:54:29,540
too but I remember when Bobby put together at Pax the little indie podcast alley one year at Pax

3656
02:54:30,580 --> 02:54:34,020
that was through the whole all games thing that we had one year when we were with them

3657
02:54:34,020 --> 02:54:44,020
so it's crazy to me how like that attitude is gone see you know I feel you I used to be able

3658
02:54:44,020 --> 02:54:51,220
to do press for Comic-Con but as it would more industry when they denied me I said it ain't worth

3659
02:54:51,220 --> 02:54:58,260
it they told me I did not have enough hits on my site for them to give me a press pass and it's not

3660
02:54:58,260 --> 02:55:02,260
like it's not like I don't want to make this clear because I don't want people being like oh they're

3661
02:55:02,260 --> 02:55:06,500
whining or it's the ego or something like that it's not really that but it's this whole thing

3662
02:55:06,500 --> 02:55:11,140
where it's like well if you don't want me why am I going to bother going and I just I get so much

3663
02:55:11,140 --> 02:55:17,140
more out of fan run expos that's why I love Dragon Con fan run magfest was a lot of fun fan fan run

3664
02:55:17,140 --> 02:55:23,380
like I'm just getting more rewards being a loud ass fan which I think is a good way to describe

3665
02:55:23,380 --> 02:55:32,020
a podcaster or a twitch streamer a loud ass fan exactly we tend to succeed at fan cons oh speaking

3666
02:55:32,500 --> 02:55:35,780
let me tell you this quick story let me get out of here there's a small local convention

3667
02:55:36,500 --> 02:55:42,340
I kind of had a I guess a one-sided argument with them they denied me press I'm just like can you

3668
02:55:42,340 --> 02:55:47,620
tell me the reason why because I like to know why that way I can fix things for the following year

3669
02:55:47,620 --> 02:55:55,780
learn from that you know they told me that my press site wasn't good enough because we're not

3670
02:55:55,780 --> 02:56:03,060
like the local newspaper or the tv station I'm sorry abc is not going to send a newsman to your

3671
02:56:03,060 --> 02:56:09,060
little podoc convention to do coverage when a local newspaper does that they're going to

3672
02:56:09,060 --> 02:56:14,740
write up a little page little story two pictures tops you got small press lights like myself that

3673
02:56:14,740 --> 02:56:20,340
will go around and take hundreds of pictures interview all these people and put all this

3674
02:56:20,340 --> 02:56:25,700
content up ab abc is going to come out there and get pictures of all the people in costume and be

3675
02:56:26,340 --> 02:56:29,780
look what's going on at the hilton this week and then they'll show you know people dressed

3676
02:56:29,780 --> 02:56:35,940
in costume behind the current temperatures that's what's gonna happen mm-hmm well anyway

3677
02:56:36,580 --> 02:56:40,180
all right uh rama I'm gonna let you go to see if we get any more calls in but any other thoughts

3678
02:56:40,180 --> 02:56:47,620
for our listeners tonight um I don't have any right now but it is what it is all right well

3679
02:56:47,620 --> 02:56:52,980
take care of my friend youtube brother all right bye all right uh orange lounge radio all one word

3680
02:56:53,060 --> 02:56:58,180
on skype bob bobbie's popping off in chat but he sees right on the money bobbie says my favorite

3681
02:56:58,180 --> 02:57:02,820
pack story was that they invited rob and i to be on a panel about building a podcast community

3682
02:57:02,820 --> 02:57:07,860
they removed the panel from the schedule and then denied us press passes i i forgot that that

3683
02:57:07,860 --> 02:57:15,460
happened because that was so shitty i don't have i i honestly don't have another word for it sorry

3684
02:57:15,460 --> 02:57:20,180
and maybe that explains where some of my bitterness from packs comes from but that was so shitty like

3685
02:57:20,180 --> 02:57:26,260
or wasn't there like a year where they like denied a press passes or something even though

3686
02:57:26,260 --> 02:57:32,500
like we were part of like the microsoft you know like we had our icon stuff the podcasting

3687
02:57:32,500 --> 02:57:41,460
communities like we had our own you know i'm sure that was e3 or gamertag ridiculous uh but we you

3688
02:57:41,460 --> 02:57:47,860
know we're we're recognized we see we have our own thing on xbox you get your own gamertag with our

3689
02:57:48,180 --> 02:57:52,580
picture you know what and i remember that because bobbie says we we had a listener who bought extra

3690
02:57:52,580 --> 02:57:56,100
passes sold us to face value because we had already booked the travel and hotel that's why

3691
02:57:56,100 --> 02:57:59,540
it was so shitty because i'd already spent my money to go out there so i could be on this

3692
02:57:59,540 --> 02:58:05,860
fucking panel and then they didn't even end up doing it so whatever you know what i'm doing

3693
02:58:05,860 --> 02:58:11,620
great panels at other cons so that's that but that was i mean what else would you call it we

3694
02:58:11,620 --> 02:58:16,420
booked travel and hotel and then we can't even get tickets because they pulled it at the last minute

3695
02:58:16,420 --> 02:58:22,660
and then god yeah i don't even know if i ever really i i don't i don't know if i ever properly

3696
02:58:22,660 --> 02:58:26,980
popped off on that on the show because i was still trying to maintain some sense of you know

3697
02:58:26,980 --> 02:58:32,020
professionalism oh maybe we'll give you invited back next year but in my old age i give less and

3698
02:58:32,020 --> 02:58:37,620
less of a fuck so there you go that's that's the real tea on what happened with uh packs but then

3699
02:58:37,620 --> 02:58:43,060
i mean we were there and not only is that like in the back of my head but just the whole time

3700
02:58:43,060 --> 02:58:50,180
i'm at this convention going this solo sucks anyway except packs that's what that's kind of

3701
02:58:50,180 --> 02:58:54,340
just how that year was for me except the people the people are awesome and the people are wonderful

3702
02:58:54,340 --> 02:58:59,540
and all that so all right uh let's see we'll give one more chance for any calls to come in at orange

3703
02:58:59,540 --> 02:59:04,500
lounge radio all one word on uh skype uh meanwhile while we wait for that call to come in uh loki any

3704
02:59:04,500 --> 02:59:09,460
other last minute stories to talk about no i didn't have anything but i did see like you know

3705
02:59:09,460 --> 02:59:15,700
rumor thread or whatever talking about the whole sony not going to um you know e3 and stuff like

3706
02:59:15,700 --> 02:59:19,940
that and the one the rumors was well you know those games they've been showing off at e3 last

3707
02:59:19,940 --> 02:59:24,260
year well those are all going to be launch titles for the new system so they can't really show off

3708
02:59:24,260 --> 02:59:30,340
those again because it's going to be i don't know that they might move those to launch titles but

3709
02:59:30,340 --> 02:59:35,380
i would say then what the hell's going to come out in 2019 which no i don't i don't understand i

3710
02:59:35,380 --> 02:59:41,060
mean you might have something that kind of does both like especially if playstation 5 is backwards

3711
02:59:41,060 --> 02:59:48,020
compatible with playstation 4 titles then you which i like sony backwards compatible look i know

3712
02:59:48,020 --> 02:59:53,380
bitch but i hope sony's fucking figure that out at this point right but it's kind of like when like

3713
02:59:53,380 --> 02:59:57,540
when the weu came out i feel like there were still some last minute we games they were kind of like

3738
03:01:48,020 --> 03:01:52,420
trials that are gonna go on and on and on and on um yeah it's just it's a it's just an inconvenience

03:01:52,420 --> 03:01:56,820
because i'm normally the one who drops off the kids so i'm not inconvenienced you know so i'm

3743
03:02:11,620 --> 03:02:17,780
been on jury duty so i was on a jury in 2006 right for like probably about two weeks and then i i got

3744
03:02:17,780 --> 03:02:24,020

3745
03:02:24,020 --> 03:02:27,860
there might have been one time since then i think when i was working in my current employer i got

3746
03:02:27,860 --> 03:02:32,420

3748
03:02:36,900 --> 03:02:42,180
that friday or this friday so we'll see but it sucks it's just like it's an inconvenience because

03:02:42,180 --> 03:02:46,980
it's in the middle of sacramento if it was like you know elk placerville or something like that

3750
03:02:46,980 --> 03:02:53,220
