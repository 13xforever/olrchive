0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	Tonight, things go away such as upcoming DLC for one major game and a publisher of video game guides
20000	27000	But there are new releases on the way too and we will talk about all that and more on this week on the show where every gamer has a voice
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
36000	43000	It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight episode number 752 for this November the 11th of 2018
43000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you in studio with my co-host, Techmaster Loki
48000	49000	How are you?
49000	50000	I'm fine
50000	52000	Good, good to have you back here
52000	57000	It's gonna be our last show for two weeks, well yeah cause we won't be here next week
57000	62000	So this is the Thanksgiving special I suppose
62000	72000	Although we will be here the Sunday after Thanksgiving which will pretty much be right after the Black Friday holiday
72000	73000	Steam sale
73000	74000	Supposedly
74000	75000	All sales
75000	76000	All the sales really
77000	81000	Well what's interesting is that usually that's the point in the year where like okay that's it
81000	83000	All the video games are out for the year, they're all out now
83000	84000	Not this year
84000	89000	Not this year, no you're right because especially Smash Ultimate is probably like the huge exception
89000	90000	And the same day
90000	91000	And
91000	93000	The same day as Smash Ultimate
93000	94000	Is
94000	95000	Earth Defense Wars 5
95000	101000	Oh how could I forget, you're absolutely right, Earth Defense Wars 5 is also coming out that same day
101000	108000	Not here tonight in studio, Dark Soccer or JB Summers, she is still on a work conflict for a little while
108000	111000	She will be joining us through Radio Magic later in the show
111000	117000	Of course you guys are joining us in our chat room as you do every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
117000	121000	When we tape live at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
121000	126000	We tape of course Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
126000	132000	And if you are listening to us live, you can join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
132000	135000	And as I mentioned there a little programming note, we will not be here next Sunday
135000	139000	I will be in Las Vegas or actually on Sunday I will be coming back from Las Vegas
139000	145000	Having just attended the Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest for the year 2018
145000	149000	This is, it's kinda like Blizzcon
149000	153000	But for the other MMO that a lot of people play, Final Fantasy IV
153000	156000	Actually I should, there's plenty of MMOs that lots of people play
156000	160000	But Final Fantasy XIV is another big one and it's one that I've been playing pretty much
160000	165000	I played the 1.0 version of the game ok, I suffered through the 1.0 version of the game
165000	168000	But my love of the online Final Fantasies goes back to Final Fantasy XI
168000	170000	Which Loki and I used to play as well
170000	173000	Do you still get the emails begging you to come back to Final Fantasy XI?
173000	174000	No
174000	178000	Oh they just, they're showing up on my Instagram
178000	180000	Final Fantasy XI is like advertising on Instagram
180000	184000	And they're doing some big campaign right now and I didn't even see all the details
184000	185000	If I wanna know the details
185000	187000	I would love to come back to Final Fantasy XI
187000	188000	If they make it free
188000	192000	Where is Final Fantasy XI that I can come back to? Isn't it not online anymore?
192000	194000	No it is, it's been online for PC
194000	198000	You cannot connect anymore on Playstation or Xbox 360
198000	201000	They took off that support, it's only PC
201000	202000	I thought they shut the whole thing down
202000	203000	No, it's only, no
203000	206000	The PC version is still going, I have a friend that still plays it
206000	208000	So it's still there
208000	209000	And they still add to it
209000	211000	They're still doing little things here and there
211000	214000	I mean, since they use basically a made up language
214000	216000	They'll talk about all these new zones
216000	218000	And I'm like, I have no idea what that word means
218000	220000	But sounds cool, go off I guess
220000	222000	So yeah, so
222000	225000	But this Fan Fest I'm going to in Vegas has nothing to do with XI
225000	228000	It's all about XIV which, you know, I do enjoy
228000	230000	I've been on a little bit of a hiatus from XIV
230000	232000	Just because I kinda, I don't really do the raiding
232000	235000	I don't do a lot of the endgame progression that other people do
235000	236000	So I'm just kind of in a lull right now
236000	238000	But that's why I'm excited to go to this event
238000	242000	Because it will be inevitably announcing next year's expansion
242000	244000	Because it's a very obvious pattern now
244000	249000	And not only that, but they'll probably get to, you know, do some special fights on the computer
249000	251000	Special stuff and there'll be some panels
251000	254000	And most of all, most importantly, concerts
254000	256000	So they're doing the two concerts again
256000	258000	So they're going to have a piano concert one night
258000	260000	And then they're going to have the Primals
260000	263000	Which is the band fronted by Soken
263000	265000	Who does the music of Final Fantasy XIV
265000	267000	And even if you don't play Final Fantasy XIV
267000	268000	Even if you have no interest in MMOs
268000	271000	Seriously, go listen to some of the soundtrack songs of Final Fantasy XIV
271000	273000	Because it's amazing
273000	274000	And Soken has done a great job
274000	278000	So his band will be there with that concert
278000	280000	So I'm just excited to just take that all in
280000	282000	And some other friends of mine are going to be there
282000	284000	It'll be good
284000	287000	Anyway, we're going to get into tonight's kickoff topic here in a moment
287000	289000	Which is also about Final Fantasy
289000	292000	First I want to address a couple of things that don't have anything to do with video games
292000	294000	But I think they're important to say
294000	296000	First of all, happy Veterans Day
296000	297000	I think that's very important
297000	300000	Because I know we have plenty of veterans that listen to Orange on Triadio
300000	302000	So I just want to say thank you for what you do
302000	304000	And your service
304000	306000	And defending our right to have this show
306000	308000	To have our lame ass opinions
308000	310000	And the freedom of speech that everybody defends out there
310000	312000	Working hard in our military
312000	314000	So happy Veterans Day to all of you
314000	316000	The other thing I want to address is that
316000	320000	It's really smoky here in Sacramento
320000	322000	I went out last night and I had to wear a mask
322000	324000	Because of all this smoke that's everywhere
324000	326000	It's awfully inconvenient
326000	330000	But it's nothing compared to what's happening up the road a little bit
330000	332000	In the town of Paradise
332000	334000	Or, I can't even believe I'm saying this
334000	336000	What was the town of Paradise?
336000	338000	I don't know if you all know this
338000	340000	But if you've ever read my bio
340000	342000	On vogginetwork.com
342000	344000	I actually went to Chico State for a few years
344000	346000	And I was involved with radio up there
346000	348000	So Chico is kind of like the larger town in California
348000	350000	Let's be real, when you go north of Sacramento
350000	352000	In San Francisco, there isn't a lot
352000	354000	From here to the border
354000	356000	It's a very different California
356000	358000	It's the red woody part of California
358000	360000	It's very different from what you all might think of
360000	362000	If you haven't been to California before
362000	364000	So, Chico is one of the larger towns
364000	366000	Because it has the school
366000	368000	But I distinctly remember
368000	370000	I had an old roommate who used to fix computers
370000	372000	In the town of Paradise
372000	374000	And there was a road, you take the skyway
374000	376000	You go up the skyway, Paradise is this lovely town
376000	378000	That sits up on the hill
378000	380000	It's gorgeous views from up there
380000	382000	It's why they call it that
382000	384000	I do remember visiting the town
384000	386000	And having memories
386000	388000	I'm shocked
388000	390000	I'm in a state of OMG
390000	392000	Just hearing that the town is gone
392000	394000	And it's not just affecting Paradise
394000	396000	I'm hearing now
396000	398000	It's moved into Magalia
398000	400000	And some of the other cities up there
400000	402000	That I bet a lot of you probably don't know
402000	404000	Because they are smaller communities in California
404000	406000	But it's very, very, very, very scary
406000	408000	Obviously, this is not the only part of California
408000	410000	That's on fire right now
410000	412000	It's the one that is
412000	414000	I feel like I have a little bit of connection to it
414000	416000	Because I know a lot of people from those days
416000	418000	That are being affected by this
418000	420000	But certainly the town of Thousand Oaks
420000	422000	Experiencing multiple tragedies this week
422000	424000	I mean, we had the unspeakable event
424000	426000	That happened at the country western bar with a shooter
426000	428000	And then, now they're on fire too
428000	430000	And that's affecting Malibu
430000	432000	And I'm sure some of you guys have been hearing about that one
432000	434000	Because of the celebrities posting
434000	436000	That their homes are gone
436000	438000	It's crazy
438000	440000	It's so, so crazy
440000	442000	And I was really, really disappointed
442000	444000	You know, I don't like to get political on the show
444000	446000	And I like to keep it video games
446000	448000	But I was really disappointed
448000	450000	That our leader of this nation
450000	452000	Could not write
452000	454000	A humane tweet
454000	456000	About the situation
456000	458000	And instead felt the need to
458000	460000	Use it as an opportunity to attack California
460000	462000	When I believe over 90%
462000	464000	Of the forest land in California
464000	466000	Is actually federally overseen
466000	468000	So, congrats
468000	470000	You played yourself, jerk
470000	472000	But I was so mad about that
472000	474000	But anyway, again, I'm not
474000	476000	I promise I won't get political, so I'm just gonna swallow that thought
476000	478000	But it was just very
478000	480000	Very irritating to read about
480000	482000	But if you want to try to make a positive
482000	484000	About it, no matter where you're at politically
484000	486000	I would refer you to a page
486000	488000	I don't often do this
488000	490000	But it's just a great compilation
490000	492000	That one of our local television stations
492000	494000	Put together, because I don't want to tell you
494000	496000	To do one charity or the other charity
496000	498000	Everybody might have different ways to look into it
498000	500000	So, this is a shout out to one of our local
500000	502000	TV stations, but it's cbs13.com
502000	504000	Slash help
504000	506000	So, it's very easy to understand
506000	508000	URL as well, cbs13.com slash help
508000	510000	And if you see a charity in there that looks like
510000	512000	Something you could help out with
512000	514000	And help these folks up in Paradise
514000	516000	Megalia, the North State, and people that are facing
516000	518000	This, I think that would be
518000	520000	Really, really great
520000	522000	So, I just wanted to give a shout out to that
522000	524000	Okay, anyway, I had to get it off my chest
524000	526000	I know it doesn't have to do with video games
526000	528000	But, some things are a bigger deal
528000	530000	I heard some video of it was making
530000	532000	It's way around video game blogs
532000	534000	One of my friends was like, did you see the video on Kotaku
534000	536000	With the fire, and I was like
536000	538000	Why is it on Kotaku, but
538000	540000	I mean, these are things that impact us
540000	542000	All, gamers and non-gamers alike
542000	544000	Okay, let's shift gears, Loki
544000	546000	Let's talk about video games
546000	548000	Because that is the podcast you all signed up to hear
548000	550000	And when it is smoky outside
550000	552000	On a day like today, I know I
552000	554000	Sat in the house and I played video games all day
554000	556000	Which we'll talk about during my gaming week
556000	558000	But, some people might be
558000	560000	Playing games that are not going to have
560000	562000	Much DLC in the future, right, Loki?
562000	564000	Yeah, and this is one game that I've played
564000	566000	Like, ten minutes of and really needed to go back
566000	568000	To its own point, but I'm not doing that yet
568000	570000	So, Final Fantasy XV
570000	572000	They have announced
572000	574000	That three of the four upcoming pieces
574000	576000	Of DLC have been cancelled
576000	578000	And right now
578000	580000	The one that is
580000	582000	Remaining is going to be coming out
582000	584000	Looks like next year
584000	586000	And so, the one that's left
586000	588000	Is going to be the Arden
588000	590000	And that will be coming out March 2019
590000	592000	So, the
592000	594000	Ariane
594000	596000	What is it?
596000	598000	Arane, Luna and Noctis
598000	600000	Ariane, I think is how you say it
600000	602000	I don't remember, but yeah
602000	604000	Those are cancelled
604000	606000	And then along with that
606000	608000	They said
608000	610000	They're going to be releasing a short form
610000	612000	Anime called Final Fantasy XV
612000	614000	Episode Arden Prologue
614000	616000	And that's going to be coming out
616000	618000	Looks like they have
618000	620000	Teasers that are going to be coming out on December 15th
620000	622000	And it's going to release on
622000	624000	January 10th
624000	626000	And then
626000	628000	They've got a Final Fantasy
628000	630000	XV Multiplayer Comrades
630000	632000	Which is going to be coming out on
632000	634000	PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
634000	636000	And that's on December 12th
636000	638000	The multiplayer has been out
638000	640000	This is some type of stand alone thing
640000	642000	And it's going to be
642000	644000	Some stand alone thing that will include new bosses
644000	646000	Costumes, weapons and what not
646000	648000	So, they have multiplayer in the game now?
648000	650000	I know, they patched it in a long time ago and I never bothered to check it out
650000	652000	Which might be part of the problem, but we'll get to that
652000	654000	And then of course
654000	656000	They said that there is going to be a collaboration with Final Fantasy XIV
656000	658000	Online
658000	660000	Adventurer from Another World
660000	662000	And that's going to be
662000	664000	Playable in Final Fantasy XV
664000	666000	I don't understand
666000	668000	How that's going to work, but that's on December 12th as well
668000	670000	Interesting, well I know
670000	672000	They did an event for Lightning Returns
672000	674000	In Final Fantasy XIV and Lightning shows up
674000	676000	In the world of XIV and you kind of work with her
676000	678000	In some fates and then
678000	680000	If you get enough points from participating
680000	682000	You can dress up exactly
682000	684000	I think for female characters
684000	686000	You get an outfit that looks just like Lightning
686000	688000	For male characters you get an outfit that looks like snow
688000	690000	So, yeah
690000	692000	That's what you got for participating
692000	694000	So imagine the XV crossover will be something similar in XIV
694000	696000	And then I don't know
696000	698000	If they'll put some of the bosses
698000	700000	In XV or what they're going to do
700000	702000	I don't know how that's going to work
702000	704000	But, I mean, still kind of a big deal
704000	706000	That these big DLC pieces
706000	708000	Are cancelled
708000	710000	And the guy left
710000	712000	He left Square Enix
712000	714000	The guy who had been designing all this
714000	716000	Has left
716000	718000	Which is a pretty big deal as well
718000	720000	Yeah, so
720000	722000	Hajime
722000	724000	Tabata
724000	726000	He had left
726000	728000	And he had taken over for Tetsuya
728000	730000	And Nomura back in 2013
730000	732000	He's gone though
732000	734000	Because Tetsuya Nomura is probably over on Kingdom Hearts 3 now
734000	736000	Cranking that out and then still has
736000	738000	The Final Fantasy VII remake to do after that
738000	740000	So I wonder if there was some sort of
740000	742000	Disagreement or something that caused him to leave
742000	744000	Well, the disagreement may be
744000	746000	That they were talking
746000	748000	What, like a $44 million loss
748000	750000	Or something like that on all this
750000	752000	I mean, it's pretty incredible
752000	754000	The hit
754000	756000	I don't know if it's specifically this
756000	758000	But Square Enix kind of took a hit
758000	760000	It seems like they're trying to recreate VII
760000	762000	Like the phenomenon that was VII
762000	764000	With all the spin-offs and everything
764000	766000	And it's just not ever getting to that level
766000	768000	Right
768000	770000	I have mixed feelings about this
770000	772000	Because I know XV has its fans
772000	774000	And I wouldn't even say I don't dislike XV
774000	776000	Honestly, in the
776000	778000	In the scope of all Final Fantasy
778000	780000	Games ever, XV is probably somewhere
780000	782000	In the middle of the pack for me
782000	784000	It's higher than VIII
784000	786000	It's higher than the original
786000	788000	NES trilogy, which I think it just
788000	790000	Those NES games were good
790000	792000	And they were important, but they're outshone
792000	794000	By what the technology
794000	796000	Of the later games can do
796000	798000	So I think I would rank it above some of those
798000	800000	But it's certainly not as good
800000	802000	As IV, VI, X
802000	804000	For me, I mean every
804000	806000	Critic is going to have their own list
806000	808000	Of how they rate the Final Fantasy games
808000	810000	And certainly I know
810000	812000	How I feel about VIII is extremely
812000	814000	Controversial, but
814000	816000	Yeah, XV I would say
816000	818000	Is somewhere in the middle of the pack, but
818000	820000	I think the thing that frustrates me
820000	822000	And what frustrated me about XV to begin with
822000	824000	Is that I bought the game
824000	826000	I played this game start to finish
826000	828000	For what it was, and then it was like
828000	830000	Oh hey, we're going to keep changing this game
830000	832000	But Final Fantasy
832000	834000	Was never this
834000	836000	Online persistent experience to me
836000	838000	Because it takes you
838000	840000	50 hours to beat this game
840000	842000	I don't know, it depends how fast you all play
842000	844000	But to hear them say, oh we're going to go back and change
844000	846000	Chapter 13, or whatever
846000	848000	Yeah, Chapter 13 was kind of
848000	850000	Busted and probably needed to be re-looked at
850000	852000	But I don't want to go back and
852000	854000	Just play that one chapter
854000	856000	And XV doesn't do anything for me
856000	858000	You know what I mean?
858000	860000	I'm not the biggest fan of
860000	862000	Editing these games massively
862000	864000	After they're released
864000	866000	And then XV just kind of continued to do that
866000	868000	With this model
868000	870000	I know some of the DLC was spin-off stuff
870000	872000	And that was fine
872000	874000	That's a way to do it
874000	876000	But I just felt like
876000	878000	In a way, and I think a lot of you kind of felt like this
878000	880000	Is that with Final Fantasy XV it was like
880000	882000	They were consistently adding to this game
882000	884000	They wanted to be there
884000	886000	When it actually released
886000	888000	But they weren't able to actually put in the game
888000	890000	Because they were forced to put the game out by a certain time
890000	892000	Because it had been in development for so long
892000	894000	Although we all know
894000	896000	That game's real development was only like
896000	898000	The last two or three years of the cycle
898000	900000	You know what I mean?
900000	902000	Especially if you go back and look at the original Versus 13 trailer
902000	904000	It is very clear
904000	906000	Things were scrapped, things were changed
906000	908000	And probably when this creative change happened
908000	910000	The entire thing was scrapped and redone
910000	912000	Which, you know
912000	914000	Kind of goes back to
914000	916000	Just sometimes how the big business
916000	918000	End of things can really screw things up
918000	920000	And it's what really ticked me off about the Mass Effect franchise too
920000	922000	Now what's weird
922000	924000	Is that with the Mass Effect franchise
924000	926000	I kind of wish they would have been able to do some DLC
926000	928000	But the DLC in Mass Effect
928000	930000	Would have been different
930000	932000	Like it would have been after the game
932000	934000	They wouldn't have been trying to go back and change the game in progress
934000	936000	And when they started to do that
936000	938000	Which, by the way, they started to do in Mass Effect Andromeda
938000	940000	Was go back and change all this shit about the game in progress
940000	942000	I lost interest completely
942000	944000	I was like, here we go again
944000	946000	The game I bought is not the game they wanted to put out
946000	948000	They're going back and changing everything in the middle
948000	950000	You know what, I'll go back and play it in the year
950000	952000	When it's actually done
952000	954000	And unfortunately that attitude
954000	956000	Across the board with a lot of people
956000	958000	Probably helped that game to flop
958000	960000	And now they're not going to do the Corian DLC
960000	962000	And you know that game is not remembered fondly
962000	964000	But in my opinion
964000	966000	EA fucking hosed that game
966000	968000	By forcing them to release it when they did
968000	970000	I know that game would have been in development for a long time
970000	972000	But again, I think the real development cycle
972000	974000	Was really towards the end of it
974000	976000	And it needed six more months in the oven
976000	978000	And we would have had a different story here
978000	980000	I think
980000	982000	Yeah
982000	984000	But um
984000	986000	What else did I want to say about Final Fantasy XV?
986000	988000	Then I'll look at our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com
988000	990000	But with Final Fantasy XV
990000	992000	It's just like
992000	994000	In a way, I'm kind of
994000	996000	I don't want to say I'm happy in this news
996000	998000	At all, because I don't want to take delight
998000	1000000	In the loss or in the
1000000	1002000	You know, the
1002000	1004000	I'm not one of those people that wants to see game companies
1004000	1006000	Suffer because I know that means the game makers
1006000	1008000	Suffer and that's not
1008000	1010000	I don't see how that's going to make games better
1010000	1012000	Like sometimes I read Twitter and I'm like
1012000	1014000	The fuck are you people thinking? Like these are people's
1014000	1016000	Jobs and stuff
1016000	1018000	But at a higher level
1018000	1020000	I am kind of like, in a way
1020000	1022000	Glad they're going to finally walk away
1022000	1024000	From Final Fantasy XV in a way
1024000	1026000	Like I mean they have these other little things to cap it off
1026000	1028000	I'm kind of glad they're going to walk away from Final Fantasy XV
1028000	1030000	And they can focus on the next thing creatively
1030000	1032000	Which I hope
1032000	1034000	There's a Final Fantasy XVI in the works somewhere
1034000	1036000	That hopefully has been in the works
1036000	1038000	For a while and hopefully will be done
1038000	1040000	By the time they want to release it
1040000	1042000	But I'm a little worried because
1042000	1044000	Is it just me
1044000	1046000	Or is Final Fantasy VII
1046000	1048000	Final Fantasy XVI
1048000	1050000	That's the impression I get
1050000	1052000	Final Fantasy Remake is being treated like
1052000	1054000	It's a full Final Fantasy title
1054000	1056000	So Final Fantasy VII
1056000	1058000	Is Final Fantasy XVI if you get what I'm saying
1058000	1060000	I kind of feel like that's where it's going
1060000	1062000	But I just hope
1062000	1064000	Again creatively
1064000	1066000	I think Final Fantasy kind of just needs
1066000	1068000	A kick in the pants with a new single player story
1068000	1070000	I don't know if this did it
1070000	1072000	For a lot of people
1072000	1074000	You can go back to turn based combat
1074000	1076000	Dungeon Buster
1076000	1078000	Over in our chat
1078000	1080000	At live.vognetware.com giving me the numbers
1080000	1082000	I was trying to reach for earlier
1082000	1084000	33 million from changes
1084000	1086000	To Luminous Studios
1086000	1088000	Square Enix did not have a great quarter
1088000	1090000	But Japanese physicals tend to be pretty dry
1090000	1092000	Octopath and Shadow of the Tomb Raider
1092000	1094000	Apparently did okay
1094000	1096000	But we have no idea or numbers from Square Enix
1096000	1098000	On how well they actually did
1098000	1100000	But we do know from NPD
1100000	1102000	That Octopath anyway
1102000	1104000	Was kind of a sleeper hit here
1104000	1106000	It was the number one game of the month
1107000	1108000	For that to do
1108000	1110000	So we do know some little things
1110000	1112000	Here and there
1112000	1114000	Let's see, Siya Tabiri in chat says
1114000	1116000	Was it you guys who said that Final Fantasy VIII
1116000	1118000	And The Spirits Within should have been swapped
1118000	1120000	That Final Fantasy VIII was more cinematic
1120000	1122000	And Final Fantasy The Spirits Within would have been better fodder
1122000	1123000	For an actual game
1123000	1125000	Yes I have said that before
1125000	1127000	Both of those things were in development around the same time
1127000	1129000	And I think Final Fantasy VIII as a movie
1129000	1131000	Would have been amazing
1131000	1133000	And I think there's a lot of
1133000	1135000	Ideas in The Spirits Within
1135000	1137000	That could have been a great game
1137000	1139000	And then it would have felt more like Final Fantasy
1139000	1141000	I think maybe if it had been a game
1141000	1143000	Perhaps others won't agree with me
1143000	1145000	But that's my opinion
1145000	1147000	Let's see
1147000	1149000	Dungeon Buster continues with another thought here
1149000	1151000	I wasn't a huge fan
1151000	1153000	Of Final Fantasy XV's direction
1153000	1155000	But it had enough to keep me on top of the hunts
1155000	1157000	And grind through its dungeons
1157000	1159000	It's still really surprising how far Square Enix was cutting back
1159000	1161000	However with this news
1161000	1163000	Tigercall on chat talking about the Mass Effect thing
1163000	1165000	Is it a little too soon
1165000	1167000	To reboot Mass Effect?
1167000	1169000	I don't know if
1169000	1171000	Anybody wants to see them
1171000	1173000	Reboot the Shepard story
1173000	1175000	I think it's a good idea to do somebody else's
1175000	1177000	Story in the same universe
1177000	1179000	I think that's what they tried to do with
1179000	1181000	Andromeda
1181000	1183000	Andromeda was Ryder's story
1183000	1185000	And by setting it in this whole other galaxy
1185000	1187000	That was Square Enix's creative way
1187000	1189000	Of having your choices
1189000	1191000	From the original Mass Effect trilogy
1191000	1193000	Not have as great of an impact
1193000	1195000	And not need to have as much
1195000	1197000	To account for
1197000	1199000	In Mass Effect Andromeda
1199000	1201000	As a Mass Effect fan I would be okay
1201000	1203000	If they wanted to do somebody else's
1203000	1205000	Continuing story in the Mass Effect universe
1205000	1207000	And do something like Dragon Age did
1207000	1209000	When they did Dragon Age Inquisition
1209000	1211000	And do an online thing
1211000	1213000	That lets you revisit
1213000	1215000	Seven of the biggest decisions from the Mass Effect franchise
1215000	1217000	And tailor how
1217000	1219000	Your Mass Effect universe went
1219000	1221000	From there
1221000	1223000	I don't think it has to import my Mass Effect 3 save
1223000	1225000	And know every little nook and cranny
1225000	1227000	Of what I did
1227000	1229000	I would be okay if it was maybe
1229000	1231000	50 years later
1231000	1233000	And some of the big decisions have an impact
1233000	1235000	Certainly there's going to be some of the big questions
1235000	1237000	Like, did you cure the genophage?
1237000	1239000	That's going to have a lasting effect
1239000	1241000	Was there control
1241000	1243000	Or synthesis
1243000	1245000	And they may have to
1245000	1247000	For the sake of creative reasons
1247000	1249000	The canon ending is the destroy ending
1249000	1251000	This game takes place
1251000	1253000	50 years after the destroy ending
1253000	1255000	In Mass Effect
1255000	1257000	Although I know there will be fans out there that will be like
1257000	1259000	But my ending
1259000	1261000	I would be totally okay with that
1261000	1263000	If Bioware came out and said
1263000	1265000	This is a Mass Effect game that takes place
1265000	1267000	After the destroy ending
1267000	1269000	And what happens here
1269000	1271000	I would be totally fine with that
1271000	1273000	Alright
1273000	1275000	Looking in our chat with other comments over at
1276000	1278000	Let's see
1278000	1280000	And on that note, when was the last time we saw any new trailers
1280000	1282000	Or anything for that, the Final Fantasy 7 thing
1282000	1284000	At E3, Final Fantasy 7 was nowhere to be found
1284000	1286000	And they didn't do PlayStation Experience this year
1286000	1288000	So
1288000	1290000	They could
1290000	1292000	Do the game awards
1292000	1294000	Or something like that
1294000	1296000	Or they may just sit on it for a little longer
1296000	1298000	Which makes us all wonder
1298000	1300000	If that game is facing some development struggles
1300000	1302000	Who knows
1302000	1304000	Dungeon Buster says
1304000	1306000	But they can reboot the gameplay with new ideas
1306000	1308000	And hopefully new stories
1308000	1310000	And Bobby Blackwolf says
1310000	1312000	Then they can make another game that takes place after the
1312000	1314000	Non-destroy ending
1314000	1316000	They could
1316000	1318000	But I bet they would be more interested in making a trilogy
1318000	1320000	That takes place kind of in the same
1320000	1322000	General world, but we'll see
1322000	1324000	Why don't we just do it like Pokemon
1324000	1326000	Where they have, you know
1326000	1328000	Red, green, and blue or whatever
1328000	1330000	This is the destroy ending one
1330000	1332000	I think the reality is
1332000	1334000	It's different depending on your ending
1334000	1336000	That they would really be two separate games
1336000	1338000	Developed concurrently and I just think
1338000	1340000	Financially that's not the best idea
1340000	1342000	They really need to take the Fallout 4 approach
1342000	1344000	Where it doesn't matter what you do, it all ends up being the same anyways
1344000	1346000	Honestly
1346000	1348000	To get another Mass Effect game
1348000	1350000	I would be completely okay if BioWare says
1350000	1352000	These are the canon changes
1352000	1354000	That we're exploring
1354000	1356000	And due to limitations we're just not going to be able to
1356000	1358000	Allow you to import your own
1358000	1360000	Shepard experience
1361000	1363000	If they're going to come out with another Mass Effect game
1363000	1365000	It would be for like Playstation 5 at this point
1365000	1367000	I wouldn't expect that you're going to be able to import
1367000	1369000	A Playstation 3 save file
1369000	1371000	Onto your Playstation 5, it's fine
1371000	1373000	I can let that go
1373000	1375000	Just give me a good
1375000	1377000	Freaking Mass Effect game
1377000	1379000	Of course they can't even play Playstation 1 games
1379000	1381000	On the Playstation 4
1381000	1383000	So what makes you think they're going to be able to import any
1383000	1385000	Saves in the Playstation 5
1385000	1387000	Mega Man X400 is in chat
1387000	1389000	They're saying calling it right now
1389000	1391000	Final Fantasy 7 Remake will become Final Fantasy 16
1391000	1393000	It will be different enough that Square
1393000	1395000	Will say it's a new game
1395000	1397000	That would be, that would be risky
1397000	1399000	I could see them taking some changes
1399000	1401000	And liberties with the story and maybe trying to do something like that
1401000	1403000	But it would just, it would be weird
1403000	1405000	I don't think they would ever do that
1405000	1407000	I don't, I just see them releasing
1407000	1409000	It as Final Fantasy 7
1409000	1411000	And just dropping the word remake
1411000	1413000	Why not just do that?
1413000	1415000	I would think that is more plausible
1415000	1417000	Than Final Fantasy 16
1417000	1419000	I think they're developing something else
1419000	1421000	They've got to be
1421000	1423000	We saw a Square Enix
1423000	1425000	Crystal Tools trailer or something
1425000	1427000	I remember seeing something for the Playstation 4
1427000	1429000	That showed all this crazy stuff
1429000	1431000	That Square Enix was working on
1431000	1433000	I don't think it was intended to be
1433000	1435000	People thought, is there Final Fantasy 16 stuff in there?
1435000	1437000	Eh, probably not
1437000	1439000	But there might be pieces in that
1439000	1441000	That maybe they're going to work with
1441000	1443000	I would really like to see
1443000	1445000	Square Enix, here's what they could do
1445000	1447000	In my opinion
1447000	1449000	They're probably using Final Fantasy 15's
1449000	1451000	Engine for Final Fantasy 7
1451000	1453000	You don't say based on the trailers
1453000	1455000	Yeah right, which is fine
1455000	1457000	I would be completely fine if they
1457000	1459000	Use Final Fantasy 15's remake
1459000	1461000	Or Final Fantasy 15 remake
1461000	1463000	Final Fantasy 15's engine
1463000	1465000	To make Final Fantasy 16
1465000	1467000	But instead of it being like
1467000	1469000	The Broad Trip type of game
1469000	1471000	Give me something that makes me think
1471000	1473000	Final Fantasy 9
1473000	1475000	I'm not saying literally those characters
1475000	1477000	But you know how Final Fantasy 9
1477000	1479000	Was a throwback to the classic Final Fantasy
1479000	1481000	Like, Vivi looked like a Black Mage
1481000	1483000	I'd rather it be Final Fantasy 6
1483000	1485000	But I'm saying give me that
1485000	1487000	Classic Final Fantasy taste
1487000	1489000	In that
1489000	1491000	Final Fantasy 7 isn't even really that either
1491000	1493000	Give me that
1493000	1495000	Sure, Final Fantasy 6 inspired or whatever
1495000	1497000	Give me that classic Final Fantasy taste
1497000	1499000	In Final Fantasy 15's engine
1499000	1501000	I would be super into
1501000	1503000	Characters just with the medieval look
1503000	1505000	As opposed to the cyberpunk look
1505000	1507000	And I would be super into it
1507000	1509000	I would love that
1509000	1511000	So, we'll see
1511000	1513000	Let's see, Dartitsia says
1513000	1515000	Final Fantasy 15 remake
1515000	1517000	Coming to the Playstation 9 in 2040
1517000	1519000	And the Mega Man X400 follows up his comment
1519000	1521000	And our reaction by saying
1521000	1523000	Don't be mad when it happens
1523000	1525000	I won't be mad
1525000	1527000	But it would be weird
1528000	1530000	Hey, we just finished Final Fantasy 15
1530000	1531000	We've tweaked all this up
1531000	1533000	Let's make a Final Fantasy 15 remake
1533000	1535000	To be fair, to Delvin's credit
1535000	1537000	You know what else was weird?
1537000	1539000	Final Fantasy 11 being an MMO
1539000	1541000	That you had to pay a monthly fee for
1541000	1543000	So, you know what?
1543000	1545000	Weird or cool?
1545000	1547000	Well, the game turned out great, but I never understood
1547000	1549000	Why they just didn't call it
1549000	1551000	Final Fantasy Online
1551000	1553000	Like, would that have been a terrible thing to call the game?
1553000	1555000	Like, would less people have played it
1556000	1558000	I don't think that would
1558000	1560000	But then, what would Final Fantasy 14 be?
1560000	1562000	I guess it would be Final Fantasy Online
1562000	1564000	Well, 14 was weird too, because it's like
1564000	1566000	Yeah, we have all the same races
1566000	1568000	We're just gonna call them something different
1568000	1570000	Well, that's because 1.0 is garbage
1570000	1572000	And then, the realm we're born is fantastic
1572000	1576000	But they were pigeonholed in all the garbage decisions 1.0 made
1576000	1578000	So, they did the best they could, dammit
1580000	1582000	Dartitsia says
1582000	1584000	Like how Phantasy Star Online did it
1584000	1587000	Then Final Fantasy 14 could have been Final Fantasy Universe
1590000	1592000	Even if not as many people enjoyed Final Fantasy
1592000	1594000	Not as many people enjoyed Final Fantasy Star Universe
1594000	1596000	We're gonna get a goddamn Final Fantasy game that's gonna have
1596000	1599000	The Destiny model, where it's like this single multiplayer garbage
1601000	1603000	It's called Final Fantasy 15
1603000	1605000	Oh, is this what I've missed?
1605000	1607000	Not playing the game?
1607000	1609000	No, I'm not being fair
1609000	1611000	But, think about it
1611000	1613000	All of a sudden, now there's an online mode
1613000	1615000	I want you to keep grinding
1615000	1617000	It's just weird
1617000	1619000	I don't think I always understood all the approaches
1619000	1621000	Maybe you disagree with me
1621000	1623000	And you can send an email
1623000	1625000	That's fine, participate at orangeloungeradio.com
1625000	1628000	If you want to send us an email with your thoughts
1628000	1630000	Bobby Black Wolf says
1630000	1632000	Yes, but then Final Fantasy Universe would have been released in the US
1632000	1634000	Frowny face
1634000	1636000	That's Final Fantasy Online 2
1636000	1638000	By that thinking
1638000	1640000	Because we did get Phantasy Star Universe on Xbox 360
1640000	1642000	I loved it!
1642000	1644000	I was like, I don't understand
1644000	1646000	Debate for another show
1646000	1648000	Everybody hated that game
1648000	1650000	You know what game I really loved?
1650000	1652000	The single player
1652000	1654000	PSP game
1654000	1656000	That was Universe's engine
1656000	1658000	But they made a single player PSP game
1658000	1660000	It was Phantasy Star
1660000	1662000	I don't remember what they called it, but it was great
1662000	1664000	Because it was a completely different game than Universe
1664000	1666000	But it was just like that exact same engine
1666000	1668000	But single player, and it was great
1668000	1670000	Anyway
1670000	1672000	Well let's take a trip down memory lane
1672000	1674000	Of our gaming weeks and talk about the types of
1674000	1676000	Video games that we have been playing this week
1676000	1678000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1678000	1680000	It was okay
1680000	1682000	I played a little bit of
1682000	1684000	PlayStation VR
1684000	1686000	Like on Friday I finally remembered
1686000	1688000	Oh yeah, that's right
1688000	1690000	Tetris Effect came out this week
1690000	1692000	So then I decided to sit down and play it
1692000	1694000	For a little bit, so I did
1694000	1696000	And I liked the new tracks that were in there
1696000	1698000	But yeah
1698000	1700000	I ran into the problem with it drifting to the left
1700000	1702000	Unfortunately because I was playing in PlayStation VR
1702000	1704000	So that was a little bit irritating
1704000	1706000	And then I decided to
1706000	1708000	Try some of the other games, because I've had a bunch of
1708000	1710000	VR games sitting on my hard drive
1710000	1712000	I just haven't bothered to actually
1712000	1714000	Play them yet, so one of the ones
1714000	1716000	I was actually looking forward to was
1716000	1718000	Just In Time Incorporated
1718000	1720000	Which is a VR game
1720000	1722000	It's a silly
1722000	1724000	Premise where you're
1724000	1726000	This government agency, or some sort of
1726000	1728000	Agency that
1728000	1730000	Gets to a location
1730000	1732000	Right before people are about to die
1732000	1734000	And you have to prevent them from dying
1734000	1736000	Usually by killing somebody
1736000	1738000	Else, and it's pretty funny
1738000	1740000	So the very first tutorial
1740000	1742000	Mission that they put you in
1742000	1744000	There's this person in an alley
1744000	1746000	A seedy alley next to a strip club
1746000	1748000	And there's this guy charging at
1748000	1750000	Him with a knife
1750000	1752000	And because you're wearing these special gloves
1752000	1754000	Everything moves ten times
1754000	1756000	Slower than it would in real life
1756000	1758000	So what you do, you grab the knife out of the
1758000	1760000	Hand of the guy that's about to stab him
1760000	1762000	And you stab the guy in the face
1762000	1764000	And that's the end of the mission
1764000	1766000	Okay, and it's awesome
1766000	1768000	It's hyper-violent, and it's
1768000	1770000	It's a silly
1770000	1772000	Fun game, so it's like if you
1772000	1774000	I don't know, crossing
1774000	1776000	Job simulator with
1776000	1778000	A hyper-violent game
1778000	1780000	Hyper-violent job simulator
1780000	1782000	Okay, I can dig it
1782000	1784000	I play a little bit of
1784000	1786000	I stream more DDR
1786000	1788000	And
1788000	1790000	I had a heart rate monitor
1790000	1792000	Working, but unfortunately
1792000	1794000	Fitbit decided to
1794000	1796000	Just MVP their whole
1796000	1798000	Windows 10 app
1798000	1800000	And so the Windows 10
1800000	1802000	App sucks ass
1802000	1804000	And doesn't work all the time
1804000	1806000	In fact, I only got to
1806000	1808000	Work once with the actual
1808000	1810000	With it being able to detect my Fitbit
1810000	1812000	So now, it won't detect it anymore
1812000	1814000	Like, I got it to sync just fine
1814000	1816000	With my computer, I got the heart rate monitor
1816000	1818000	To display, because we have recorded footage
1818000	1820000	Of that, and everything was perfectly fine
1820000	1822000	And sure enough, to turn on the next day
1822000	1824000	None of it wants to work again
1824000	1826000	And I blame the app
1826000	1828000	And Windows 10, because Windows 10 is buggy
1828000	1830000	As fuck, so you know
1830000	1832000	What are you gonna do?
1832000	1834000	So I guess I have to buy this
1834000	1836000	Unnecessary dongle that's
1836000	1838000	Got a plug in there to sync a Bluetooth
1838000	1840000	Thing to my computer, despite the fact that
1840000	1842000	I have Bluetooth built in
1842000	1844000	And it was synced to it at one point
1844000	1846000	I don't know, it's stupid
1846000	1848000	But that may be what I
1848000	1850000	Have to do to get it to work
1850000	1852000	Or just not put it in there
1852000	1854000	Because that may be the other option
1854000	1856000	Since it's just being difficult
1856000	1858000	We'll see
1858000	1860000	So there's that, and then
1860000	1862000	Of course I was working a little bit more
1862000	1864000	On my StepMania theme that I was gonna
1864000	1866000	Put on the cabinet
1866000	1868000	Once I load StepMania on there
1868000	1870000	So I was doing a little bit of that
1870000	1872000	And picking out songs I want to put on there
1872000	1874000	As well
1874000	1876000	Then, oh yeah
1876000	1878000	My new DVD drive
1878000	1880000	That's gonna be able to put that super disk
1880000	1882000	On there, that is coming
1882000	1884000	Very soon, hopefully
1884000	1886000	Actually, it last scanned in Washington
1886000	1888000	So it's just a few states away
1888000	1890000	Hopefully gonna get it next week
1890000	1892000	So we'll be able to do that
1892000	1894000	Preferably before
1894000	1896000	20th of November
1896000	1898000	It's the big day you're shooting for
1898000	1900000	Exactly
1900000	1902000	Are you gonna do an epic DDR stream on 20th of November?
1902000	1904000	Probably not, because it'll just be
1904000	1906000	After work, but we'll see what we can do
1906000	1908000	Alright, my gaming week
1908000	1910000	So I finally
1910000	1912000	Set up the PlayStation VR
1912000	1914000	Because I needed to play me
1914000	1916000	Some Tetris Effect, which just came out
1916000	1918000	Of course on PlayStation 4
1918000	1920000	I talked about the demo a little bit
1920000	1922000	Last week and how much I enjoyed that
1922000	1924000	So obviously I was gonna get the retail version of the game
1924000	1926000	We all knew that
1926000	1928000	I have said it on the show before
1928000	1930000	I'm a huge fan of Tetsuya Mizuguchi
1930000	1932000	I don't know if there's a game he's done that I didn't like
1932000	1934000	I even kind of thought
1934000	1936000	99 Nights was alright
1936000	1938000	But as far as things like Every Extend Extreme
1938000	1940000	Luminous
1940000	1942000	Meteos, Space Channel 5
1942000	1944000	I've always really loved
1944000	1946000	These games
1946000	1948000	So when I heard that he got the Tetris license
1948000	1950000	And that E3 trailer
1950000	1952000	Already sold, like I didn't even need a demo
1952000	1954000	I didn't need anything else, all I needed was that
1954000	1956000	Hey, Mizuguchi's doing a Tetris game
1956000	1958000	Sold, done, right?
1958000	1960000	It's basically Mizuguchi's doing a bullet
1960000	1962000	It doesn't matter, it's like okay, I'll buy it
1962000	1964000	He can do a bullet hell game and I'd buy it
1964000	1966000	I don't give a shit
1966000	1968000	He's great, I'm such a fan
1968000	1970000	So I'm saying that
1970000	1972000	Kind of as a disclaimer
1972000	1974000	Because maybe my opinion is a little biased
1974000	1976000	Because I've always been a fan of his
1976000	1978000	But I fucking love Tetris Effect
1978000	1980000	Outstanding
1980000	1982000	It's one of my favorite gaming experiences
1982000	1984000	In the last several years, honestly
1984000	1986000	It's
1986000	1988000	And I know there's people that are probably just going
1988000	1990000	It's just Tetris though
1990000	1992000	Alright, but this is like
1992000	1994000	Honestly the best version of Tetris they've done
1994000	1996000	And yes, I'm including the original NES
1996000	1998000	Yes, I'm including the Game Boy version
1998000	2000000	Yes, I'm including the DS version
2000000	2002000	That was pretty good too
2002000	2004000	That's not to say any of those versions were bad
2004000	2006000	Or more importantly, important
2006000	2008000	The original NES version
2008000	2010000	Of course, I mean Nintendo's version
2010000	2012000	Not the Atari version
2012000	2014000	Although it was important for its own reasons too
2014000	2016000	The Game Boy version was massively important
2016000	2018000	But Tetris Effect is like
2018000	2020000	The best one
2020000	2022000	And using the technology that's available today
2022000	2024000	And they have an homage to the
2024000	2026000	Game Boy Tetris song
2026000	2028000	In Tetris Effect
2028000	2030000	Oh, I haven't discovered that yet
2030000	2032000	That's pretty cool
2032000	2034000	I've discovered in some of the
2034000	2036000	Marathon modes
2036000	2038000	Or what are those
2038000	2040000	Not the Journey, Effect
2040000	2042000	It's in one of the Effect ones
2042000	2044000	The Effect stuff, some of it has the classic Tetris
2044000	2046000	Brick styles and stuff
2046000	2048000	Which is cool
2048000	2050000	So here's the thing, some of you are probably going to be skeptical
2050000	2052000	And you're like, Rob, it's $40 for Tetris
2052000	2054000	But here's the thing
2054000	2056000	Especially in VR
2056000	2058000	It's an experience
2058000	2060000	It's a trip
2060000	2062000	It is relaxing
2062000	2064000	It is engrossing
2064000	2066000	It is beautiful
2066000	2068000	I don't know how else to describe it
2068000	2070000	This is a great
2070000	2072000	Application to sell PlayStation VR with
2072000	2074000	Because you know what makes this great
2074000	2076000	You know what makes this great for PlayStation VR
2076000	2078000	Is that it's not
2078000	2080000	Like a jump around and flail
2080000	2082000	With the PlayStation Move game
2082000	2084000	Not that there's anything wrong with those types of games
2084000	2086000	But I think it says a lot
2086000	2088000	That the experience of playing on PlayStation VR
2088000	2090000	Where you're just simply sitting on the couch
2090000	2092000	With your headset on
2092000	2094000	And the controller
2094000	2096000	That playing this in PlayStation VR
2096000	2098000	Allows the world around you
2098000	2100000	To literally disappear
2100000	2102000	Especially if you're playing with headphones on
2102000	2104000	And really immersing the sound
2104000	2106000	As well as the visuals
2106000	2108000	It allows you to really just focus on
2108000	2110000	The game
2110000	2112000	And the experience of
2112000	2114000	The music and the art
2114000	2116000	That is being created as you're playing this game
2116000	2118000	Because even though
2118000	2120000	Yes you're removing distractions in the real world
2120000	2122000	You know there are
2122000	2124000	I'm using my quoting fingers
2124000	2126000	Distractions that the game provides
2126000	2128000	But it really feels like a journey
2128000	2130000	That you go on
2130000	2132000	When you complete lines
2132000	2134000	Like let's say you're playing a stage
2134000	2136000	Where the background is an ocean that you're flying across
2136000	2138000	And when you complete lines
2138000	2140000	Dolphins will come out of the ocean
2140000	2142000	Like in the rhythm to the music and do things
2142000	2144000	But then like maybe after you've cleared so many lines
2144000	2146000	Things kind of like go underwater
2146000	2148000	It's like you're just doing this trip
2148000	2150000	But Tetris is just that central theme
2150000	2152000	But like
2152000	2154000	The nice thing is everybody knows
2154000	2156000	How to play Tetris
2156000	2158000	I'm not saying everybody knows how to play Tetris well
2158000	2160000	But everybody understands I think
2160000	2162000	The basic concept of Tetris is not an incredibly
2162000	2164000	Difficult one to explain
2164000	2166000	So this is just a really
2166000	2168000	Easy game to get into
2168000	2170000	And even if you don't have PlayStation
2170000	2172000	VR I still think there's a lot
2172000	2174000	Here worth seeing especially if you like
2174000	2176000	Puzzlers I mean this is
2176000	2178000	Tetris
2178000	2180000	If it was done like Luminous
2180000	2182000	That is exactly what it is
2182000	2184000	There's really nothing else for me to explain about this game
2184000	2186000	Either you're gonna understand that
2186000	2188000	Description or you're not because you've played Luminous
2188000	2190000	You're either gonna understand it or you're not
2190000	2192000	But even if you don't understand it
2192000	2194000	I really like check out some YouTubes
2194000	2196000	Check out some people playing
2196000	2198000	It check out what it looks like and
2198000	2200000	Just see for yourself like what a
2200000	2202000	Trip it is but if you can if you have a friend
2202000	2204000	That has PlayStation VR or something
2204000	2206000	Really you owe it to yourself
2206000	2208000	To check this out in VR and really
2208000	2210000	Experience how the
2210000	2212000	Total immersion in a game
2212000	2214000	Like this can really change
2214000	2216000	The game playing experience
2216000	2218000	It's really something to behold
2218000	2220000	And then I guess one other thing
2220000	2222000	I'll say about it again the whole like it was
2222000	2224000	$40 for Tetris
2224000	2226000	You got like the main journey
2226000	2228000	Or story mode that has lots and lots of skins
2228000	2230000	That you unlock as you're playing the game
2230000	2232000	But then there's also like this side mode
2232000	2234000	This effect mode where you have
2234000	2236000	Sometimes weekend competitions
2236000	2238000	And you do this
2238000	2240000	You can do like mystery blocks
2240000	2242000	Or you gotta clear 40 lines
2242000	2244000	As fast as possible or you have
2244000	2246000	To clear particular poison blocks
2246000	2248000	On the field in a certain amount of time
2248000	2250000	Or you have to clear one
2250000	2252000	Line over and over like there's all these different types
2252000	2254000	Of like edit modes so it doesn't
2254000	2256000	Really feel stale and you know
2256000	2258000	All these different type of edit modes have their own skins
2258000	2260000	And you're trying to play to unlock them
2260000	2262000	So that you can just do your own mode with the skins
2262000	2264000	That you like if that's what you want to do
2264000	2266000	And you know that's another thing that's available to you
2266000	2268000	But I know the game
2268000	2270000	Is getting hazed a little bit because many people
2270000	2272000	Remember Tetris for multiplayer
2272000	2274000	Which is what the NES version
2274000	2276000	The DS version and the Game Boy
2276000	2278000	Version really all brought to the table right
2278000	2280000	Was the multiplayer actually did the NES version
2280000	2282000	Have that maybe not
2282000	2284000	Did the NES version no it did you can do side by side
2284000	2286000	It's been so long Loki
2286000	2288000	I knew the Game Boy one was infamous
2288000	2290000	For that with link cable and everything ok yeah
2290000	2292000	The original NES did no I don't think
2292000	2294000	I think Tengen Tetris had it
2294000	2296000	I don't think NES Tetris had it
2296000	2298000	Somebody in chat let me know about that
2298000	2300000	Did Tetris NES have multiplayer
2300000	2302000	I don't think it did
2302000	2304000	But anyway
2304000	2306000	I know the Game Boy did
2306000	2308000	But anyway
2308000	2310000	I don't think the game
2310000	2312000	Totally needs
2312000	2314000	Multiplayer I kind of feel
2314000	2316000	Like that's a door they left shut
2316000	2318000	Because if there is a Tetris
2318000	2320000	Effect 2 and I really hope there
2320000	2322000	Is a Tetris Effect 2 and this game
2322000	2324000	Deserves a Tetris Effect 2 I have a
2324000	2326000	Feeling that's a door they'll open and explore
2326000	2328000	But for this they wanted it to really be about the
2328000	2330000	Immersion the experience
2330000	2332000	And when you are sitting there with a VR
2332000	2334000	Headset on maybe looking at
2334000	2336000	Another player to yell at them about how they're stacking
2336000	2338000	Up lines on you is not something that really
2338000	2340000	Fits in with that picture you know you can't really
2340000	2342000	Immerse and do multiplayer
2342000	2344000	I think so
2344000	2346000	Maybe that's why they made the artistic
2346000	2348000	Decision they did
2348000	2350000	Dark Tetsuya said Tengen Tetris did
2350000	2352000	Two modes in fact
2352000	2354000	And Mega Man X400 says
2354000	2356000	NES Tetris had multi I thought it didn't
2356000	2358000	I thought the Tengen one did
2358000	2360000	And that's why people crave
2360000	2362000	That cart more but I didn't think
2362000	2364000	Oh well it doesn't
2364000	2366000	Ultimately at this point that game is how old
2366000	2368000	This is the new shit get on Tetris Effect
2368000	2370000	Leave the multiplayer
2370000	2372000	Behind for a little bit if you must play
2372000	2374000	Multiplayer Tetris get
2374000	2376000	The Tetris DS because it's
2376000	2378000	It's a great version of that
2378000	2380000	And has many other great stuff too but this is
2380000	2382000	Worth it on its own merits
2382000	2384000	As far as other games I've been
2384000	2386000	Playing this week I have been continuing Diablo 3
2386000	2388000	On the Switch I was streaming a little bit
2388000	2390000	Of that actually and I'm just about
2390000	2392000	To hit level 70 on my seasonal character
2392000	2394000	So I've been making away
2394000	2396000	On that otherwise
2396000	2398000	I've been still playing a little bit of
2398000	2400000	World of Warcraft I think my
2400000	2402000	Little warlock there is level
2402000	2404000	118 so I'm almost to level
2404000	2406000	120 where I can do the cool kid end game stuff
2406000	2408000	But for right now just still stuck on
2408000	2410000	Level 118 and trying to work on that
2410000	2412000	So that is about it for my gaming
2412000	2414000	Week so we'll get on into
2414000	2416000	The rest of the news for this week usually
2416000	2418000	I would do housekeeping but I've already told you
2418000	2420000	We're not going to be here next week so
2420000	2422000	But I look forward to
2422000	2424000	Talking to you guys all about Final Fantasy
2424000	2426000	Fan Fest you can always follow me on Twitter
2426000	2428000	Of course if you want some tweets because I'm sure
2428000	2430000	I'll be tweeting up a storm while I'm there
2430000	2432000	Maybe if the cell signal
2432000	2434000	Is decent maybe I'll do a twitch stream
2434000	2436000	From the convention floor because that's something people
2436000	2438000	Do now right so
2438000	2440000	Yeah maybe I'll try doing that if
2440000	2442000	Big if my cell phone signal
2442000	2444000	Cooperates I don't remember how good
2444000	2446000	It was or wasn't
2446000	2448000	At the Rio because they had it
2448000	2450000	At the Rio in 2014 but they did it at a
2450000	2452000	Different hotel in 2016 so I don't remember
2452000	2454000	What the cell signal was like there but I do
2454000	2456000	Remember in 2014 one of the gifts
2456000	2458000	They gave you in the goodie bag which I thought
2458000	2460000	Was brilliant a little cell phone charger
2460000	2462000	And it was already like full
2462000	2464000	And ready to go and I was like this is
2464000	2466000	This is brilliant sadly I don't think they've already
2466000	2468000	Released the contents of this year's goodie bag
2468000	2470000	I don't think they have that you get like a full
2470000	2472000	Like actual backpack this year which is kind of cool
2472000	2474000	Cool yeah but they also
2474000	2476000	Released an update about how we're all gonna
2476000	2478000	Have to go through metal detectors to get into the convention
2478000	2480000	Just because of the way the
2480000	2482000	World is in 2018 just compared to even
2482000	2484000	2016 yeah when that wasn't a factor
2484000	2486000	But
2486000	2488000	That is what it is alright anyhow
2488000	2490000	Let's get into some other gaming news Loki
2490000	2492000	Alright so this is
2492000	2494000	Sad but Prima Games is shutting
2494000	2496000	Down after 28 years
2496000	2498000	Prima of course you may remember
2498000	2500000	Does strategy guides for
2500000	2502000	Such games
2502000	2504000	Like we were talking about earlier Final
2504000	2506000	Fantasy 15 for example or
2506000	2508000	You know I think even Grand Theft Auto and that
2508000	2510000	Type of stuff so they're gonna be
2510000	2512000	Closing their doors
2512000	2514000	I wonder why
2514000	2516000	Now they're not closing
2516000	2518000	Until next spring but they're not
2518000	2520000	Gonna be publishing any new strategy guides for
2520000	2522000	The remainder of this year
2522000	2524000	Aren't they
2524000	2526000	The ones that are here locally I think they are local
2526000	2528000	They're the ones that are out in Roseville right
2528000	2530000	Because I know there's two big strategy guide
2530000	2532000	Companies and I think Prima is the one that's out in Roseville
2532000	2534000	Which is not far from here
2534000	2536000	Yeah I think so
2536000	2538000	I don't know
2538000	2540000	I don't remember if
2540000	2542000	That is them
2542000	2544000	I think it could be though
2544000	2546000	I think it is but I mean
2546000	2548000	Regardless it is still
2548000	2550000	Still a little I mean I would say it's surprising
2550000	2552000	And at the same time I hate to say it like with the internet
2552000	2554000	Having
2554000	2556000	Dismantled regular instruction manuals
2556000	2558000	But I mean strategy guides
2558000	2560000	Were always a heck of a collectible
2560000	2562000	They were and also
2562000	2564000	Like sometimes
2564000	2566000	I know I can use the internet for like certain things
2566000	2568000	Like I know with Grand Theft Auto 5
2568000	2570000	I bought the strategy guide twice
2570000	2572000	I bought it when they had
2572000	2574000	You know the Xbox 360
2574000	2576000	PlayStation 3 version and then I bought it again
2576000	2578000	When it came out for
2578000	2580000	Or was it 4 I'm thinking of
2580000	2582000	I must be thinking of 4
2582000	2584000	I don't know one of them I probably bought it for 5 as well
2584000	2586000	No I did definitely buy it for 5
2586000	2588000	So I bought it again when the
2588000	2590000	PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC versions
2590000	2592000	Came out too because they had a whole new
2592000	2594000	Strategy guide and it was you know
2594000	2596000	I bought it to
2596000	2598000	100% everything
2598000	2600000	Which I still haven't done
2600000	2602000	Prima is located in Roseville
2602000	2604000	And I'm going to get very local for a minute
2604000	2606000	But it's for Loki's understanding
2606000	2608000	You know how there's Kaiser out in Roseville? Yeah I know where it is
2608000	2610000	Target's on one side, Prima's on the other
2610000	2612000	Well myself and Jamie we got invited to go there one time
2612000	2614000	That's right you guys went there once
2614000	2616000	And I didn't go
2616000	2618000	But we ended up not being able to meet with them
2618000	2620000	Like something our cancel lesson
2620000	2622000	I think Jamie did
2622000	2624000	I know she did but anyway that was a long time ago
2624000	2626000	I don't remember if that was
2626000	2628000	Like a secret meeting or what that was all about
2628000	2630000	Doesn't matter now
2630000	2632000	But it's still unfortunate
2632000	2634000	To hear what that's all going through over there
2634000	2636000	But I think again
2636000	2638000	It's just the whole internet industry
2638000	2640000	Just really
2640000	2642000	Kind of people go to Game Facts
2642000	2644000	YouTube
2644000	2646000	YouTube is a huge thing too
2646000	2648000	Absolutely now go into our chat over at
2648000	2650000	Live.vognetwork.com
2650000	2652000	It says nobody reads game guides anymore
2652000	2654000	It's all about the YouTube walkthroughs
2654000	2656000	Even Game Facts gets less used these days
2656000	2658000	Cuddlebucket in chat
2658000	2660000	I like that name
2660000	2662000	Says their money probably came from licensing I think
2662000	2664000	Can't imagine sales for physical guides have been great
2664000	2666000	Since the internet age
2666000	2668000	I always kind of saw
2668000	2670000	Again I saw it more as like collectibles
2670000	2672000	People just like to have that coffee table book
2672000	2674000	You know
2674000	2676000	I mean I use the hell out of
2676000	2678000	The Grand Theft Auto 5 one
2678000	2680000	Because it was
2680000	2682000	You have to make sure that you didn't miss anything
2682000	2684000	So that you can get 100%
2684000	2686000	And I know with games like Red Dead Redemption 2
2686000	2688000	There's ways you can miss missions
2688000	2690000	And stuff in the game
2690000	2692000	If you don't do everything
2692000	2694000	And Grand Theft Auto 5 was kind of like that too
2694000	2696000	With some of the characters you can pick up for the heist missions
2696000	2698000	If you didn't do the one thing at a certain time
2698000	2700000	You'll miss it
2700000	2702000	And that's where the guide comes in
2702000	2704000	And also finding collectibles
2704000	2706000	Because fuck that shit
2706000	2708000	Tell me where they are and I'll just go pick them up
2710000	2712000	Kaijuto in chat says
2712000	2714000	Oh strategy guide I thought it was the game mag
2714000	2716000	The game mags suck
2716000	2718000	I don't think Prima had a game magazine
2718000	2720000	Maybe they did at one point
2720000	2722000	But they were definitely more known for the guides
2722000	2724000	And that was
2724000	2726000	I remember when you'd go into Game Flop
2726000	2728000	And it would be like oh I'm going to pre-order this game
2728000	2730000	They do that now
2730000	2732000	Oh you want to get the strategy guide with it?
2732000	2734000	Yeah you get 20% off the strategy guide
2734000	2736000	Doesn't Game Flop use their own
2736000	2738000	In-house guide creator at this point?
2738000	2740000	No I don't think so
2740000	2742000	Because Red Dead you can buy it
2742000	2744000	Or they even have one for Super Mario Odyssey
2744000	2746000	And they're starting to get phone book thick
2746000	2748000	With a game like Red Dead I'm sure
2748000	2750000	Yeah
2750000	2752000	Alright
2752000	2754000	Cia Tabiri in chat says
2754000	2756000	The strategy guides almost felt like enhanced art books sometimes
2756000	2758000	And that's not a bad thing though
2758000	2760000	Right?
2760000	2762000	Some of them were
2762000	2764000	Final Fantasy VII strategy guide
2764000	2766000	And it was like its own unique art and stuff
2766000	2768000	I think Allen used to love to buy those guides
2768000	2770000	Like back in the day
2770000	2772000	Because we have a bunch of them on the bookshelf
2772000	2774000	They're for old ass players
2774000	2776000	They're more collectible items
2776000	2778000	They are
2778000	2780000	Moving on
2780000	2782000	Let's talk a little bit about some news out of Microsoft
2782000	2784000	Because Microsoft had their
2784000	2786000	X018 event this weekend
2786000	2788000	In Mexico City which was pretty cool
2788000	2790000	Because you know usually it's like
2790000	2792000	They do something in New York, Vegas
2792000	2794000	Los Angeles, maybe Europe
2794000	2796000	Maybe Japan
2796000	2798000	But you don't often hear of like a big game event in Mexico
2798000	2800000	So that was pretty cool that you know they got something there
2800000	2802000	So for the
2802000	2804000	X018 event we did get a little bit of news
2804000	2806000	I would say probably like not
2806000	2808000	Major major stuff on
2808000	2810000	The par of what you
2810000	2812000	Get out of a
2812000	2814000	Playstation experience event
2814000	2816000	Which reminder they're not doing one this year
2816000	2818000	Which is interesting
2818000	2820000	But we did get some minor updates
2820000	2822000	Including the fact that PUBG is going to be added to Game Pass
2822000	2824000	Microsoft continues to really try to push
2824000	2826000	The Game Pass which is
2826000	2828000	It's hard to argue with that
2828000	2830000	They're really trying to up the value of that
2830000	2832000	Another game that they're going to be putting on Game Pass
2832000	2834000	Crackdown 3
2834000	2836000	Which has it's official launch game
2836000	2838000	February 19th, 2019
2838000	2840000	I thought it was 15th
2840000	2842000	Might depend on the part of the world
2842000	2844000	The article I'm looking at says February 9th
2844000	2846000	That could be Europe
2846000	2848000	No it is 15th, I think there's a typo
2848000	2850000	In the show world thread, that's fine
2850000	2852000	So it's February 15th, my bad
2852000	2854000	Heaven forbid they make you wait
2854000	2856000	4 more days Loki, you've been waiting how long
2856000	2858000	No
2858000	2860000	No more waiting
2860000	2862000	Done, I'm done waiting
2862000	2864000	I gotta say though, I did watch the trailer for it
2864000	2866000	And Terry Crews is awesome
2866000	2868000	Of course, we knew that
2868000	2870000	Terry Crews
2870000	2872000	It's totally just like
2872000	2874000	An Old Spice commercial right there
2874000	2876000	He had one where it was him
2876000	2878000	Yelling at himself
2878000	2880000	Because it was his character and then him playing himself
2880000	2882000	Telling each other to be
2882000	2884000	Prepared for anything or something like that
2884000	2886000	It was ridiculous
2886000	2888000	And I loved every second of it
2888000	2890000	I saw the gameplay
2890000	2892000	Oh man
2892000	2894000	They have really
2894000	2896000	Toned down the visuals on that
2896000	2898000	It's not like
2898000	2900000	Remember, we need the cloud
2900000	2902000	The cloud's gotta process all this destruction
2902000	2904000	Because it's so crazy
2904000	2906000	This multiplayer mode has an arena
2906000	2908000	That you can destroy
2908000	2910000	It's not the city, it's an arena
2910000	2912000	It's not as
2912000	2914000	As a spectacle
2914000	2916000	As it was before
2916000	2918000	I'm still gonna buy it
2918000	2920000	I don't fucking care
2920000	2922000	It's disappointing
2922000	2924000	Let's see, also this is a pretty big deal
2924000	2926000	I think for some people
2926000	2928000	The Final Fantasy 13 trilogy
2928000	2930000	Is being added to
2930000	2932000	Backwards compatibility on Xbox One
2932000	2933000	That's pretty cool
2933000	2934000	Except for the fact that
2934000	2936000	The games I own are all on PlayStation
2936000	2938000	But that's fine, whatever, congrats
2938000	2940000	Well, you just have to wait for that PlayStation
2940000	2942000	Backwards compatibility
2942000	2944000	But that's really cool
2944000	2946000	For the Xbox folks
2946000	2948000	And I think they said something about
2948000	2950000	Civilization Revolutions
2950000	2952000	Getting like a 4K
2952000	2954000	That's pretty rad
2954000	2956000	If I had an Xbox One X, I'd be really excited
2956000	2958000	But I don't, but I still think that's really cool
2958000	2960000	They're supporting that
2960000	2962000	They did show another Kingdom Hearts 3 trailer
2962000	2964000	With the 100 Acre Wood
2964000	2966000	They talked about mouse and keyboard support
2966000	2968000	On Xbox One coming very soon
2968000	2970000	And they did confirm Fortnite will be a mouse and keyboard game
2970000	2972000	On Xbox One
2972000	2974000	So, cool
2974000	2976000	Even though I would kinda wonder
2976000	2978000	Why you're not using a PC
2978000	2980000	But I suppose not everybody has a PC
2980000	2982000	As beefy as perhaps an Xbox One X
2982000	2984000	Is capable of processing
2984000	2986000	So, still pretty neat I guess
2986000	2988000	And then they did detail some of the expansion
2988000	2990000	For Forza Horizon 4
2990000	2992000	Where you're gonna be looking for treasure
2992000	2994000	In lightning storms
2994000	2996000	So it looks like you'll be kinda using that weather stuff again
2996000	2998000	But this time it's gonna be lightning
2998000	3000000	But you can't take any damage from the lightning
3000000	3002000	So what does it matter?
3002000	3004000	Yeah, exactly, who cares
3004000	3006000	I mean, with all these stuff I've crashed into
3006000	3008000	If lightning hits the car, that's actually safe
3008000	3010000	They say you can be in a car
3010000	3012000	And if lightning hits the car, you'll be fine
3012000	3014000	It's like a big conductor, I guess
3014000	3016000	It's not gonna be very effective in all those backwards compatibility games
3016000	3018000	Stop it, stop it
3018000	3020000	So here's the thing
3020000	3022000	Then the biggest news
3022000	3024000	By far the biggest news
3024000	3026000	Out of X018
3026000	3028000	In my opinion
3028000	3030000	Two more studio acquisitions
3030000	3032000	So do you remember how the big news coming out of E3
3032000	3034000	Was that Microsoft acquired like what
3034000	3036000	Like five or six at E3
3036000	3038000	Guess what, now they've got two more
3038000	3040000	So they have acquired
3040000	3042000	Nxile Entertainment
3042000	3044000	And Obsidian
3044000	3046000	That's a pretty big deal, especially when it comes to RPGs
3046000	3048000	So they are definitely
3048000	3050000	Getting their chess pieces in a row
3050000	3052000	For whatever Xbox One
3052000	3054000	Successor is, Nxbox if you will
3054000	3056000	I don't think you're gonna see
3056000	3058000	Any huge announcements from these companies
3058000	3060000	Right away, but I definitely
3060000	3062000	Think Microsoft is positioning the chess pieces
3062000	3064000	So that when they announce Nxbox
3064000	3066000	I really think they're just gonna be like
3066000	3068000	And we're gonna have
3068000	3070000	This game, and this game
3070000	3072000	And this game, and this game
3072000	3074000	And this game, and they're gonna go
3074000	3076000	Like all through their studios
3076000	3078000	And I really think that's an E3 that's coming
3078000	3080000	Is when Microsoft is gonna be like
3080000	3082000	Not only are we putting out this system
3082000	3084000	But game from this in-house
3084000	3086000	Game from this in-house, game, game
3086000	3088000	Game, game, and they're gonna
3088000	3090000	Really try to
3090000	3092000	One up the hell out of Sony
3092000	3094000	And whatever they've got in store for Playstation 5
3094000	3096000	Hoping and praying that Sony
3096000	3098000	Isn't cooking up as many
3098000	3100000	Exclusives of their own
3100000	3102000	Because I mean track record though
3102000	3104000	Sony does release some big exclusives
3104000	3106000	I mean
3106000	3108000	If Microsoft can time it to get like
3108000	3110000	All six or seven of their studios
3110000	3112000	To like put out
3112000	3114000	One game every other month for an entire
3114000	3116000	Year, that's gonna be really fucking
3116000	3118000	Impressive
3118000	3120000	Do you think that's the direction Microsoft's headed in?
3120000	3122000	Cause I sure do
3122000	3124000	I think the system's lacking
3124000	3126000	Exclusives
3126000	3128000	And so that's gonna help
3128000	3130000	I mean that's really
3130000	3132000	The only piece of the puzzle I think
3132000	3134000	That they're missing, that and
3134000	3136000	Japan but you know
3136000	3138000	Akuma JP in chat says and again
3138000	3140000	Microsoft is buying their way out
3140000	3142000	Well, money talks
3142000	3144000	That's what companies do though
3144000	3146000	That's what they do, how else are they gonna get exclusives
3146000	3148000	If they really
3148000	3150000	Cause there's a part of me as well that still goes
3150000	3152000	Microsoft still feels like they're writing off Japan
3152000	3154000	If Microsoft really
3154000	3156000	Wanted to turn some heads
3156000	3158000	They'd fucking buy Capcom, Konami
3158000	3160000	Namco Bandai
3160000	3162000	Like one of the big
3162000	3164000	Well actually I would be totally okay with Microsoft
3164000	3166000	Like honestly, I'm gonna make the case right here
3166000	3168000	And y'all are gonna disagree, I don't give a fuck
3168000	3170000	I think the way to save Konami
3170000	3172000	At this point is for Microsoft to buy it
3172000	3174000	And I think that would be a wonderful thing
3174000	3176000	I would love to see Microsoft buy Konami
3176000	3178000	You can send those hate mail
3178000	3180000	To Rob Roberts, care of Orange Launch Radio
3180000	3182000	Participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com
3182000	3184000	But let's be real, y'all hate Konami's management
3184000	3186000	You all hate Konami's management
3186000	3188000	So why not
3188000	3190000	Get rid of them and replace them
3190000	3192000	With Microsoft's management
3192000	3194000	Which some of you are probably thinking
3194000	3196000	God, that would be even worse
3196000	3198000	Is it right now?
3198000	3200000	I don't know, Microsoft's management is in a much better place
3200000	3202000	Much, much better place
3202000	3204000	With the Xbox One than it was
3204000	3206000	When good old Don Mattrick was unveiling it
3206000	3208000	Sports, sports, sports, TV, TV, TV
3208000	3210000	So
3210000	3212000	I would kind of love
3212000	3214000	Now, I'm sure
3214000	3216000	It's a little more complicated
3216000	3218000	Because Konami has their arcade
3218000	3220000	Division, Konami has the
3220000	3222000	Casino stuff, which is all really big too
3222000	3224000	Speaking of which
3224000	3226000	Maybe there's a way that they only buy a case set
3226000	3228000	Speaking of which, was it
3228000	3230000	According to the 20th anniversary
3230000	3232000	DDR thing, supposed to be announcing
3232000	3234000	New game next week
3234000	3236000	Or in a couple weeks
3236000	3238000	In time to 20 November, probably
3238000	3240000	Yeah, probably time to 20 November
3240000	3242000	If Microsoft really wanted to do something big
3242000	3244000	They'd buy Nintendo
3244000	3246000	You can't buy Nintendo
3246000	3248000	No, you can't buy Nintendo
3248000	3250000	Nintendo has way too much cash on hand
3250000	3252000	Even after the Wii U
3252000	3254000	Kind of did not live up to expectations
3254000	3256000	It doesn't matter, Nintendo is swimming in money
3256000	3258000	After the Wii
3258000	3260000	I'm just
3260000	3262000	Like, yeah, I'm just
3262000	3264000	Being fan wank completely
3264000	3266000	It's not as easy as Microsoft
3266000	3268000	There's a strategic partnership with Nintendo
3268000	3270000	Where they take care of their online
3270000	3272000	And then Nintendo can make some games for them
3272000	3274000	She Hulk in chat
3274000	3276000	Says Microsoft should buy Nintendo
3276000	3278000	There it is, or Bill Gates should
3278000	3280000	And then we can play Gears of War on the Switch
3280000	3282000	I just, again
3282000	3284000	Although, in theory, you would think
3284000	3286000	Microsoft has endless, endless amounts of cash
3286000	3288000	So does Nintendo
3288000	3290000	So it makes them very difficult to buy
3290000	3292000	In that regard
3292000	3294000	But, again
3294000	3296000	I think a region like Konami's home computing division
3296000	3298000	Is not where it used to be
3298000	3300000	And I think is really ripe for the pickin'
3300000	3302000	Whoever releases the next Ridge Racer
3302000	3304000	Is gonna be the winner
3304000	3306000	It comes down to
3306000	3308000	We need a new Ridge Racer game
3308000	3310000	Uh
3310000	3312000	Go ahead
3312000	3314000	Sorry, this is a great comment from Dungeon Buster
3314000	3316000	Live.vognetware.com
3316000	3318000	They're building up their backlot
3318000	3320000	The way Netflix is gobbling indie filmmakers
3320000	3322000	That is an awesome comparison, in my opinion
3322000	3324000	Yeah, unfortunately they don't release several
3324000	3326000	New seasons of some shows
3326000	3328000	That I really like that are indie filmmakers
3328000	3330000	As well, but
3330000	3332000	What are you gonna do?
3332000	3334000	Hey, it could be worse
3334000	3336000	They could be buying EA or buying games
3336000	3338000	Or they could be like EA buying game companies
3338000	3340000	And then sucking them dry and then
3340000	3342000	Throwing them away
3342000	3344000	You know what though, Netflix is the company that brought us
3344000	3346000	Chris Pine's dick, so you know what?
3346000	3348000	All is forgiven
3348000	3350000	Okay
3351000	3354000	I did see that Chris Pine was in something
3354000	3356000	So I will now not watch that
3356000	3358000	Well, your wife's gonna make you
3358000	3360000	She's not gonna make me
3360000	3362000	She's gonna give a shit about Chris Pine's dick
3362000	3364000	No, I was gonna say
3364000	3366000	SSG100Matt says
3366000	3368000	Never thought we'd talk about that tonight
3368000	3370000	No, I was gonna say
3370000	3372000	One game that I'm surprised we haven't seen Nintendo
3372000	3374000	Put out yet
3374000	3376000	They have new games out in the arcade
3376000	3378000	Cruisin, the Cruisin series
3379000	3381000	Their latest one was a Cruisin
3381000	3383000	Blast or whatever it was
3383000	3385000	That's a Nintendo game
3385000	3387000	In the arcade
3387000	3389000	They should put that on console
3391000	3392000	Why not?
3392000	3393000	They should
3393000	3395000	Well, they should make some other racing games too
3395000	3397000	But you know
3397000	3399000	Okay, for everybody in chat that's like
3399000	3401000	I don't wanna see that movie
3401000	3403000	I'm sure there's lots of titties as well
3403000	3405000	I haven't watched the movie myself
3405000	3407000	And let's be real, I'm not gonna watch the movie
3409000	3412000	I barely have time to play video games anymore
3412000	3413000	This is what the internet's for
3413000	3415000	The internet will screen capture that shit
3415000	3417000	Are you saying the internet is for porn?
3418000	3420000	I'm saying the internet is for
3420000	3422000	Finding things without having to suffer
3422000	3424000	Through the rest of it
3424000	3426000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says
3426000	3428000	Yeah, that reminds me what Akuma said
3428000	3430000	Whatever happened to the supposed Ridge Racer sequel?
3432000	3434000	Well, there was the one that was on PC
3434000	3436000	Yeah
3436000	3438000	Alright, let's move home with some more stories
3438000	3440000	Going on to Loki
3440000	3442000	Alright
3442000	3444000	And apparently with the Fallout
3444000	3446000	PC beta going on
3446000	3448000	People have already developed
3448000	3450000	Mods for it
3450000	3452000	So they have a mod called Hairspray
3452000	3454000	Which allows you to customize the hair color
3454000	3456000	Of your vault dweller
3456000	3458000	Beyond what is available in the game
3458000	3460000	Of course, this being
3460000	3462000	An online game
3462000	3464000	The only person that's gonna see that is you
3464000	3466000	So it doesn't matter
3466000	3468000	No one's gonna actually see that
3468000	3470000	But apparently
3470000	3472000	You know, there's other
3472000	3474000	Mods available
3474000	3476000	Like for example, there's one that has
3476000	3478000	There's been actually several different Bethesda games
3478000	3480000	But a lock picking bar
3480000	3482000	So it shows you the sweet spot
3482000	3484000	For picking a lock
3484000	3486000	Which allows you to pick a lock pretty easy
3486000	3488000	Without wasting too many value pins
3490000	3492000	But I'm guessing
3492000	3494000	That maybe they're gonna be
3494000	3496000	Patching the mount once the game comes out
3496000	3498000	Then again, who knows
3498000	3500000	But
3500000	3502000	What's ridiculous though, speaking of patching
3502000	3504000	Fallout 76
3504000	3506000	Is gonna be getting a day one patch
3506000	3508000	That's actually larger than the game itself
3508000	3510000	So
3510000	3512000	The game
3512000	3514000	I think right now is
3514000	3516000	About
3516000	3518000	Like 45 gigs
3518000	3520000	And the day one patch is gonna be
3520000	3522000	54.64 gigabytes
3524000	3526000	Which is ridiculous
3526000	3528000	Goodbye bandwidth cap
3528000	3530000	Are we sure it's not like a patch that just bridges
3530000	3532000	The gap between what's on the disk
3532000	3534000	And maybe just a few gigabytes
3534000	3536000	Of the differences between
3536000	3538000	That sounds like insane to me
3538000	3540000	I don't know
3540000	3542000	But it's pretty bad
3542000	3544000	That they have a patch that big
3544000	3546000	And I don't know what they're gonna be doing
3546000	3548000	I mean aside, they said a large number of bug fixes
3548000	3550000	enhancements
3550000	3552000	Feature changes
3552000	3554000	And
3554000	3556000	I don't know
3556000	3558000	So we'll see
3558000	3560000	And apparently they're working on
3560000	3562000	You know, fighting off some
3562000	3564000	Hacking exploits
3564000	3566000	I don't think
3566000	3568000	That much of what they're gonna do
3568000	3570000	Is gonna have any effect on that
3570000	3572000	I think it's gonna be a big ol' mess
3572000	3574000	I'll wait and see because it's not a game
3574000	3576000	I'm planning on picking up
3578000	3580000	Alright, I don't really
3580000	3582000	Super get into the Fallout series
3582000	3584000	It's just one of those things
3584000	3586000	I don't like the fact that it's an online game
3586000	3588000	I'm kinda tired of that
3588000	3590000	I like Fallout being just like
3590000	3592000	Even like it was Skyrim
3592000	3594000	And that's kind of ironic because Skyrim
3594000	3596000	I would like that to be a multiplayer game
3596000	3598000	That'd be fun
3598000	3600000	But it'd be fun just as in co-op
3600000	3602000	Like I wanna play co-op with somebody
3602000	3604000	And play through Skyrim
3604000	3606000	That would be fun
3606000	3608000	Kill me and nuke my shit
3608000	3610000	No, that's not really
3610000	3612000	Entertaining for me
3612000	3614000	I don't know
3614000	3616000	Alright, well earlier in the show I brought up Mass Effect
3616000	3618000	And what could be in the future of the franchise
3618000	3620000	And this past week we had
3620000	3622000	N7 Day, I don't know if y'all know that
3622000	3624000	But N7, which is kind of the name of the
3624000	3626000	Special Forces unit in Mass Effect
3626000	3628000	Is usually celebrated November 7th
3628000	3630000	And historically
3630000	3632000	Bioware used to do some big reveals
3632000	3634000	And announcements on N7 Day
3634000	3636000	They've been down the past few years
3636000	3638000	Especially now that Andromeda's been out or what have you
3638000	3640000	But they did come out
3640000	3642000	And say that on Bioware's official
3642000	3644000	Twitter they basically said
3644000	3646000	They did this whole thing with the memories
3646000	3648000	What the series means to them and all that
3648000	3650000	And also they did kinda stealth announce
3650000	3652000	That an Xbox One X patch
3652000	3654000	For Mass Effect Andromeda
3654000	3656000	Did go live
3656000	3658000	So you get some 4K enhancements
3658000	3660000	But if I remember right, Playstation Pro
3660000	3662000	Kinda had those already
3662000	3664000	But this would bring it in parody
3664000	3666000	With Playstation Pro and probably some of the same stuff
3666000	3668000	That's in the PC version anyway
3668000	3670000	But still cool
3670000	3672000	It's nice for the people that are playing
3672000	3674000	On the Xbox One that they get that
3674000	3676000	I guess it's better resolution
3676000	3678000	And HDR lighting, so probably just some of the same stuff
3678000	3680000	From PC to be honest
3680000	3682000	But anyway, Casey Hudson
3682000	3684000	Who's now the general manager of Bioware
3684000	3686000	But of course he was a big part of the original trilogy
3686000	3688000	He basically
3688000	3690000	Did kinda come out and say
3690000	3692000	That
3692000	3694000	The tweet text
3694000	3696000	Or whatever says that
3696000	3698000	And Hudson talked about this saying that
3698000	3700000	There's future Bioware games in Mass Effect
3700000	3702000	In the Dragon Age series
3702000	3704000	So Mass Effect is not dead
3704000	3706000	There will be no
3706000	3708000	Killing of the franchise
3708000	3710000	The quote that he said
3710000	3712000	It means coming into the studio every day
3712000	3714000	Dreaming about what the next great Mass Effect game
3714000	3716000	Will be
3716000	3718000	So I guess they'll revisit it at some point in the future
3718000	3720000	But I'm still not pre-ordering Anthem
3720000	3722000	EA
3722000	3724000	The way you treated Mass Effect's Andromeda
3724000	3726000	I'm not gonna be jumping up support
3726000	3728000	Anthem, so good luck
3728000	3730000	Good luck y'all
3730000	3732000	Just to give you hope on how EA is treating things
3732000	3734000	Isn't there like N7 armor available
3734000	3736000	In Anthem or something? I heard about that
3736000	3738000	No, I'm sure that's gonna be a thing
3738000	3740000	But I was just gonna mention since it's not on our show roll
3740000	3742000	You know there's a game called Battlefield 5
3742000	3744000	That's coming out
3744000	3746000	I've heard of this game
3746000	3748000	But
3748000	3750000	Oh god, it's the whole thing where it's like 3 weeks early
3750000	3752000	Or something like that
3752000	3754000	But if you subscribe to their PC service
3754000	3756000	That allows you to do all these games
3756000	3758000	You get it like 10 days earlier
3758000	3760000	Oh, but if you order like the
3760000	3762000	Premium edition or whatever
3762000	3764000	Then you get a few days after that
3764000	3766000	And then if you
3766000	3768000	Get just the base game
3768000	3770000	Well you're gonna have to wait until the 20th
3770000	3772000	Or whatever it is
3772000	3774000	Well, I hope EA has a 100%
3774000	3776000	Quality product on their hands
3776000	3778000	Because when that does release early
3778000	3780000	The internet is gonna fucking tear it apart
3780000	3782000	Just like they did with Mass Effect Andromeda
3782000	3784000	And if the slightest thing is wrong with that game
3784000	3786000	It will be under a microscope
3786000	3788000	Just like it was with Mass Effect Andromeda
3788000	3790000	And basically what I'm saying is EA
3790000	3792000	You should've learned your fucking lesson already
3792000	3794000	Or Battlefront 2
3794000	3796000	I feel bad for the developers
3796000	3798000	I'm gonna leave it at that
3798000	3800000	I hope the game is 100%
3800000	3802000	100.00%
3802000	3804000	Quality
3804000	3806000	Because any flaw in that is going to be under a microscope
3806000	3808000	And then you're gonna get those fucking tweets
3808000	3810000	That are like, I cancelled my pre-order
3810000	3812000	Because you fucking flopped this in Battlefield
3812000	3814000	And
3814000	3816000	I guess EA kind of forgot
3816000	3818000	That like, the first week sales
3818000	3820000	Of a game is really important
3820000	3822000	And I'm sorry, all of these people
3822000	3824000	Are not gonna suddenly shell out twice as much
3824000	3826000	Money to play it three weeks early
3826000	3828000	It's ridiculous
3828000	3830000	It is though
3830000	3832000	Anyway
3832000	3834000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
3834000	3836000	Rob was about to go on a Loki style rant
3836000	3838000	And Loki interrupts it to defuse it
3838000	3840000	I'm the only one who rants here, bitch
3840000	3842000	I don't think that's what you said
3842000	3844000	I didn't really have the full on rant
3844000	3846000	I said what I needed to say
3846000	3848000	We'll just leave it at that
3848000	3850000	Alright, let's move on
3850000	3852000	So Sony's got this
3852000	3854000	Playstation classic that's gonna be coming out
3854000	3856000	On December 3rd for $100
3856000	3858000	And of course they announced all their games with that
3858000	3860000	And now with different websites
3860000	3862000	Kind of showing little previews
3862000	3864000	On how it looks
3864000	3866000	We get to see what exactly we're getting
3866000	3868000	For $100
3868000	3870000	Well apparently the console is gonna be using
3870000	3872000	Standard USB controllers
3872000	3874000	So the, you know, non-dual
3874000	3876000	Shock Playstation controllers
3876000	3878000	So that's at least cool because maybe you can use that
3878000	3880000	On your PC and stuff
3880000	3882000	The other thing that's kind of interesting is that
3882000	3884000	It's running an open source Playstation emulator
3884000	3886000	Called PCSX Re-Armed
3886000	3888000	So
3888000	3890000	They're using basically just a PC emulator
3890000	3892000	On this console
3892000	3894000	To emulate these games
3894000	3896000	Which begs the question
3896000	3898000	Why do I even want to buy this then?
3898000	3900000	Because it's cute
3900000	3902000	It's not though
3902000	3904000	And they have like games from, it seems like from different
3904000	3906000	Regions as well, like they have the European
3906000	3908000	Version of
3908000	3910000	Let's see
3910000	3912000	It says, yeah they said a lot of the games that they
3912000	3914000	Booted up on the Playstation classic were in the European
3914000	3916000	Version, so like Final Fantasy 7
3916000	3918000	For example
3918000	3920000	Then also like
3920000	3922000	Grand Theft Auto
3922000	3924000	Yeah they're like
3924000	3926000	Click on a UK flag to display
3926000	3928000	The text in English
3928000	3930000	I wonder though if that's not necessarily so much
3930000	3932000	That's a European version of the game
3932000	3934000	Or if it's because DMA Designs at the time
3934000	3936000	Was a European company
3936000	3938000	So, you know, it would make sense that they would have a
3938000	3940000	European flag on there
3940000	3942000	I just don't know like
3942000	3944000	It wouldn't be the first time I've seen the English
3944000	3946000	Language represented by that flag
3946000	3948000	It's not like something to be
3948000	3950000	It's not a news worthy
3950000	3952000	Piece of news in my opinion
3952000	3954000	The thought is because the fact that it runs
3954000	3956000	This emulator is probably why there's such
3956000	3958000	A limited
3958000	3960000	Support for
3960000	3962000	There's a limited amount of games on here because
3962000	3964000	The games supported by the emulator
3964000	3966000	Aren't necessarily like the vast library
3966000	3968000	Also they're saying that
3968000	3970000	Some of the games like Ridge Racer Type 4
3970000	3972000	It has this like blurry
3972000	3974000	Dither defect on the text
3974000	3976000	Which probably looked good on a normal
3976000	3978000	TV which I remember it looking fantastic
3978000	3980000	On my old TV because I had a little 13
3980000	3982000	CRT but now
3982000	3984000	Looks really blurry
3984000	3986000	And hard to read which yes that's how it
3986000	3988000	Looks like on my computer so
3988000	3990000	Interesting I don't know
3990000	3992000	So you might want to
3992000	3994000	Cautiously wait for this
3994000	3996000	I think it's neat
3996000	3998000	But
3998000	4000000	Do I really need another thing I could put
4000000	4002000	NES games on?
4002000	4004000	I don't really
4004000	4006000	Bobby in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says
4006000	4008000	The C64 Mini runs Vice
4008000	4010000	This is a popular thing to just have these
4010000	4012000	Minis running emulators
4012000	4014000	They want you to buy it because it's all packaged nicely
4014000	4016000	It's for people who are not tech
4016000	4018000	Masters and don't already have the emulators themselves
4018000	4020000	He has a fair point
4020000	4022000	It's you know it's supposed to be that
4022000	4024000	Attractive thing on the shelf that Grandma
4024000	4026000	Is buying you for the Christmas tree
4026000	4028000	And I get that and that's why the SNES
4028000	4030000	Classic and the
4030000	4032000	NES Classic are fantastic because
4032000	4034000	Those games look great when it's upscaled
4034000	4036000	On a TV
4036000	4038000	I gotta say though this is kind of the
4038000	4040000	Awkward generation the Nintendo 64
4040000	4042000	And Playstation 1
4042000	4044000	It doesn't hold up as well
4044000	4046000	The Nintendo 64 might be a little bit
4046000	4048000	Better because
4048000	4050000	Mario 64 is a great game
4050000	4052000	But man
4052000	4054000	It's rough
4054000	4056000	It's rough to look at
4056000	4058000	Maybe like the Playstation 2 classic emulator
4058000	4060000	Whenever that comes out someday
4060000	4062000	Maybe I'll be on board with that
4062000	4064000	Only if it has Magic Pen Gel
4064000	4066000	Magic Pen Gel
4066000	4068000	Hell yes
4068000	4070000	And I don't know
4070000	4072000	Even the Japanese game lineup was way better too
4072000	4074000	I want an armored core
4074000	4076000	God dammit
4076000	4078000	Alright well I know one
4078000	4080000	Game that
4080000	4082000	Bobby Blackwolf says
4082000	4084000	Playstation 3 classic has Eye of Judgment
4084000	4086000	Then it can be a million seller
4086000	4088000	Oh that's
4088000	4090000	Wouldn't that be great if all these years later
4090000	4092000	The Playstation Eye
4092000	4094000	They finally sell a million copies of Eye of Judgment
4094000	4096000	And by the time you're 50 years old
4096000	4098000	You have to dress up like Tingle
4098000	4100000	Motherfuckers
4100000	4102000	Alright
4102000	4104000	I bet there's so many people that listen
4104000	4106000	Well there's not a lot of people that listen to OLR
4106000	4108000	But I bet there's enough now
4108000	4110000	They probably don't even know what that joke was
4110000	4112000	So we made this bet
4112000	4114000	When the Playstation Eye was first announced
4114000	4116000	So it was a long time ago
4116000	4118000	What were we calling it? The Brown Eye of Judgment or something like that?
4118000	4120000	No it's because they had this game
4120000	4122000	We saw it at E3
4122000	4124000	We went to E3 and we saw it through a demonstration
4124000	4126000	They're playing cards
4126000	4128000	They're playing a card game and I'm like
4128000	4130000	I don't fucking understand why I need to buy this
4130000	4132000	To play this stupid card game
4132000	4134000	Just play the card game
4134000	4136000	Why do I need to see the TV?
4136000	4138000	So Loki took a bet and the bet was
4138000	4140000	And he said if they sell a million copies of Eye of Judgment
4140000	4142000	He would dress up as Tingle
4142000	4144000	For the webcam that we had at the time
4144000	4146000	And come to the show
4146000	4148000	The closest we ever got was
4148000	4150000	One holiday, one Halloween
4150000	4152000	You came dressed up as Sackboy
4152000	4154000	From Little Big Planet, remember that?
4154000	4156000	Yeah, I do remember that
4156000	4158000	He had a really fancy little Sackboy card
4158000	4160000	That was about as close as we got
4160000	4162000	But we wanted you to be Tingle
4162000	4164000	Oh the other closest thing is that that Flappy
4164000	4166000	I always forget about Flappy Vog, it's been so long now
4166000	4168000	There was also
4168000	4170000	It was
4170000	4172000	He was one of our old listeners
4172000	4174000	He works at a game company
4174000	4176000	That had a Kickstarter
4176000	4178000	And one of the
4178000	4180000	Kickstarter things was like if you got
4180000	4182000	I don't remember if it was likes
4182000	4184000	Or random drawing
4184000	4186000	Or donations or something like that
4186000	4188000	Someone would draw you in a certain style
4188000	4190000	So I had the girl draw me
4190000	4192000	Oh yes, I remember that
4192000	4194000	And then there was
4194000	4196000	I remember there was an episode
4196000	4198000	It was the last episode we ever did on Live 365
4198000	4200000	Before we moved to All Games Radio
4200000	4202000	That was a long time ago, right?
4202000	4204000	That was before Vog, right?
4204000	4206000	So there was
4206000	4208000	We did a list list or something
4208000	4210000	What could Live 365 do to get us to stay
4210000	4212000	And I think one of the winning answers was
4212000	4214000	Purchase one million copies of the High of Judgement
4214000	4216000	By the way
4216000	4218000	Oh my god
4218000	4220000	I love this
4220000	4222000	This is so, this is recursive right now
4222000	4224000	So I'm actually looking at the Orange Lounge Radio
4224000	4226000	Wiki, because there is a wiki that
4226000	4228000	The fans have done
4228000	4230000	I don't think I've ever edited an article
4230000	4232000	I don't even think I know how
4232000	4234000	But there's actually a whole article
4234000	4236000	On the Orange Lounge Radio wiki
4236000	4238000	OrangeLoungeRadio.wiki.com
4238000	4240000	About the High of Judgement bet
4240000	4242000	On September 23, 2007
4242000	4244000	Wow, that's old
4244000	4246000	Loki exclaimed
4246000	4248000	That there would be no way that the High of Judgement
4248000	4250000	Would sell any considerable amount of units
4250000	4252000	Upon hearing this
4252000	4254000	Rob in the chat room suggested
4254000	4256000	That they should start a bet with Loki
4256000	4258000	Oh yeah, you want to take a bet on that?
4258000	4260000	The bet was that if the High of Judgement
4260000	4262000	Could sell a considerable amount of units
4262000	4264000	Loki would dress up as Tingle
4264000	4266000	Loki accepted the bet and set the rules
4266000	4268000	The High of Judgement must sell one million
4268000	4270000	Units in six months worldwide
4270000	4272000	This was later changed from
4272000	4274000	Six months to all time, because then you got cocky
4274000	4276000	Yeah
4276000	4278000	After the rules were set
4278000	4280000	Rob suggested another condition
4280000	4282000	While dressed up as Tingle
4282000	4284000	Loki would play an online match of
4284000	4286000	Eye of Judgement with Bobby Blackwolf
4286000	4288000	And set the Playstation Eye on fire
4288000	4290000	In the middle of the match
4290000	4292000	I don't even remember that, but that's awesome
4292000	4294000	Kudos me
4294000	4296000	And we would still totally do that
4296000	4298000	I know
4298000	4300000	I kind of feel like Loki would just
4300000	4302000	Do that for free without the Tingle outfit
4302000	4304000	Bobby, do you have a copy?
4304000	4306000	On March 2, 2008
4306000	4308000	At 9pm, Loki changed the bet
4308000	4310000	Once again
4310000	4312000	And combined the sales
4312000	4314000	Requirement total with the game
4314000	4316000	Let's Ride Friends Forever
4316000	4318000	For the bet
4320000	4322000	But then
4322000	4324000	On June 11, 2010
4324000	4326000	The bet was declared over
4326000	4328000	Why did we do that?
4328000	4330000	Because I think it was never gonna, I don't know
4330000	4332000	On November 11, 2018
4332000	4334000	The bet was reopened
4336000	4338000	Can we get on that please?
4338000	4340000	On November 11, 2018
4340000	4342000	The bet was reopened
4342000	4344000	Because now there might be a Playstation 3
4344000	4346000	Classic some day
4346000	4348000	By the way, they even, God
4348000	4350000	You guys are so fucking awesome
4350000	4352000	The final results
4352000	4354000	304,769
4354000	4356000	Plus
4356000	4358000	43,355 equals
4358000	4360000	348,124
4360000	4362000	Note, VG charts did not have
4362000	4364000	Any sales information on the European version
4364000	4366000	Of Eye of Judgment
4366000	4368000	Or sales information on any version
4368000	4370000	Of Let's Ride Friends Forever that wasn't the DS
4370000	4372000	Version
4372000	4374000	Y'all fucking brought your receipts
4374000	4376000	I'm so fucking proud, thank you Wiki people
4376000	4378000	I'm checking right now
4378000	4380000	If there's
4380000	4382000	An actual copy of Eye of Judgment
4382000	4384000	For sale on eBay that I can
4384000	4386000	Burn, oh hey, 1099
4386000	4388000	That's not bad
4388000	4390000	Cuddlebucket in chat says
4390000	4392000	This scenario needs to have Dark Sakura in the background
4392000	4394000	Looking disapprovingly
4394000	4396000	Are you kidding? She'll be handing him the match
4396000	4398000	I can get a
4398000	4400000	Complete set, including a Playstation
4400000	4402000	I can't because I don't know where the hell mine is
4402000	4404000	For 2699
4404000	4406000	Wow
4406000	4408000	Maybe we'll just do it
4408000	4410000	We'll be one more
4410000	4412000	We'll do a Twitch stream some day
4412000	4414000	Loki almost
4414000	4416000	Since it sold a third of the requirements
4416000	4418000	Loki performs a third of the bet
4418000	4420000	And there was the
4420000	4422000	Eye of Judgment Legends which was on PSP
4422000	4424000	I just don't think it ever sold
4424000	4426000	A significant amount of copies to count
4426000	4428000	Ugh
4428000	4430000	Alright
4430000	4432000	S2100Matt says it ended production
4432000	4434000	Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was what
4434000	4436000	Caused us to say it was done
4436000	4438000	But I'm sorry, that's not fun
4438000	4440000	To end it, so it's reopen
4440000	4442000	You just have to convince Sony
4442000	4444000	To do it again
4444000	4446000	What's the physical
4446000	4448000	Game company that, you know, they'll make
4448000	4450000	Physical copies of digital games
4450000	4452000	You just have to convince them to do it
4452000	4454000	Oh, there you go, to make their own Eye of Judgment
4454000	4456000	Throwback
4456000	4458000	I love it, I love it
4458000	4460000	Anyhow
4460000	4462000	Let's move on
4462000	4464000	To one more story here
4464000	4466000	Before we get to the classic game of the week
4466000	4468000	And it has to do with another very modern VR
4468000	4470000	Game, and this game is a lot
4470000	4472000	Of fun as well
4472000	4474000	It's not one you can just sit there on the couch and play
4474000	4476000	But it's still fun, it's a game called Beat Saber
4476000	4478000	Excuse me, I had the hiccups
4478000	4480000	The game is called Beat Saber
4480000	4482000	And it's going to be coming out on the PlayStation 4
4482000	4484000	On November 20th
4484000	4486000	Which made a lot of music fans
4486000	4488000	Chuckle, because November 20th
4488000	4490000	Is a date usually associated with Dance Dance Revolution
4490000	4492000	Because there's a song
4492000	4494000	That, well actually it goes back to Beatmania
4494000	4496000	Over and over again in the Bomani franchise
4496000	4498000	Called 20 November, so
4498000	4500000	And there was even a 19 November
4500000	4502000	In one of the 2DX
4502000	4504000	Didn't they do a 21 November at some point?
4504000	4506000	I feel like that was a thing in 2DX
4506000	4508000	At one point, I don't know
4508000	4510000	I think you're thinking of September
4510000	4512000	Maybe, I see what you did
4512000	4514000	Alright anyway, so Beat Saber is going to be coming out
4514000	4516000	On November 20th, and of course
4516000	4518000	This is the game that you play in VR
4518000	4520000	Where you slash beats that are coming at you
4520000	4522000	Sometimes you have to duck
4522000	4524000	Or move around
4524000	4526000	The manifestations of walls
4526000	4528000	And things like that
4528000	4530000	And this game is also a little bit controversial
4530000	4532000	Because you're not just graded on
4532000	4534000	Special performance, but you are graded on style
4534000	4536000	How much flourish do you have with your moves
4536000	4538000	So it'll be very interesting
4538000	4540000	Also some features
4540000	4542000	There's supposed to be some extra PlayStation
4542000	4544000	Exclusive tracks
4544000	4546000	Like 5 PlayStation exclusive tracks
4546000	4548000	And there's going to be some brand new
4548000	4550000	Campaign mode that wasn't originally in the PC version
4550000	4552000	But the makers of Beat Saber
4552000	4554000	Have been working hard on the port
4554000	4556000	I do believe they plan to go back to update the PC version
4556000	4558000	To have the campaign mode
4558000	4560000	I don't think it'll have the tracks, but modders
4560000	4562000	Will take care of that certainly
4562000	4564000	I mean if they put the fucking B movie
4564000	4566000	In Beat Saber then they'll put these
4566000	4568000	5 missing songs in as well
4568000	4570000	You can all look for that on PC soon
4570000	4572000	But for PlayStation 4 people who don't have
4572000	4574000	Oculus or HTC Vive
4574000	4576000	You can check that out on your PlayStation VR on November 20th
4576000	4578000	I know I will be, because I
4578000	4580000	Really enjoyed Beat Saber when I played it on Bobby's
4580000	4582000	HTC Vive when I was at Dragon Con
4582000	4584000	Earlier this year
4584000	4586000	Are you going to be looking into
4586000	4588000	Getting the Beat Saber
4588000	4590000	Maybe, I don't know
4590000	4592000	You should, if nothing else check it out
4592000	4594000	Check it out over here
4594000	4596000	After I get it and see what you think
4596000	4598000	So there you go, by the way
4598000	4600000	The wiki has already been updated, somebody did put on there
4600000	4602000	On November 11th the bet was reopened
4602000	4604000	Thank you, appreciate that
4604000	4606000	It won't matter
4606000	4608000	You're getting cocky over there Loki
4608000	4610000	Getting cocky, alright
4610000	4612000	I guess it's time we go to the classic game of the week
4612000	4614000	What do you say? Sure
4614000	4616000	And so we take
4616000	4618000	A step into that portal that's marked
4618000	4620000	Radio Magic, and we end up
4620000	4622000	With the one and only Dark Sakura joining us
4622000	4624000	For the classic game of the week, hi Jamie
4624000	4626000	Oh hi
4626000	4628000	Hi, how are you doing?
4628000	4630000	I'm okay
4630000	4632000	It's kind of
4632000	4634000	Headachy with all the smoke outside
4634000	4636000	Oh yeah, I'm sure we will have
4636000	4638000	Addressed it in the show before this point
4638000	4640000	But the smoke here is like terrible
4640000	4642000	And obviously the disaster that's going on out there
4642000	4644000	Is really really terrible
4644000	4646000	The effect it's having on so so so
4646000	4648000	Much of the state is crazy
4648000	4650000	Yeah I saw
4650000	4652000	The pictures online just from downtown
4652000	4654000	And that haze of brown was really
4654000	4656000	Frightening, yeah it's like brown fog
4656000	4658000	But anyway on a somewhat
4658000	4660000	Lighter note, something that we do
4660000	4662000	When it's smokey outside is we stay inside
4662000	4664000	And we play lots of video games on a lazy
4664000	4666000	Day, but once a week Dark Sakura
4666000	4668000	Likes to find a game that she thinks, hey
4668000	4670000	You know what, you need to respect the classics
4670000	4672000	Put down your newfangled Playstation VRs
4672000	4674000	And pick up a classic
4674000	4676000	It's the classic game of the week
4676000	4678000	Dark Sakura, what did you pick for this week's
4678000	4680000	Classic game of the week
4680000	4682000	Metal Gear
4682000	4684000	Metal Gear
4684000	4686000	I can't do the David Hayter voice
4686000	4688000	Well and to be fair, David Hayter
4688000	4690000	Did not voice Metal Gear on the
4690000	4692000	NES, which most people
4692000	4694000	Are probably familiar with, although
4694000	4696000	Not really where Metal Gear got its start
4696000	4698000	Right?
4698000	4700000	Yeah, well actually it didn't even get its start on the NES
4700000	4702000	Right
4702000	4704000	Metal Gear first came out in 1987
4704000	4706000	For the MSX2 computer
4706000	4708000	In Japan and Europe
4708000	4710000	It is the
4710000	4712000	Actually considered to be the
4712000	4714000	Progenitor of the stealth genre
4714000	4716000	And it was the first video game
4716000	4718000	Designed by Hideo Kojima
4718000	4720000	Who went on to do all the later ones
4720000	4722000	Well most of the later ones
4722000	4724000	The Metal Gear 2
4724000	4726000	That we got on
4726000	4728000	NES was not the real
4728000	4730000	Metal Gear 2
4730000	4732000	He had nothing to do with it
4732000	4734000	The game, the original game
4734000	4736000	Was reworked for the Famicom
4736000	4738000	And then that was the one that got
4738000	4740000	Internationally released and it was developed
4740000	4742000	Without Kojima and had
4742000	4744000	Some drastically altered level
4744000	4746000	Designs and a bunch of changes
4746000	4748000	There's a more faithful port
4748000	4750000	Of the MSX2 version that came out
4750000	4752000	Metal Gear Solid 3
4752000	4754000	Subsistent to Playstation 2
4754000	4756000	And the HD edition that came out
4756000	4758000	The PS3, Xbox 360, and PlayStation V
4758000	4760000	They also had
4760000	4762000	A revised translation
4762000	4764000	I really want to play that version someday
4764000	4766000	I have never played that version
4766000	4768000	I loved Metal Gear NES as a kid
4768000	4770000	And of course as a kid you don't realize how butchered the game was
4770000	4772000	From its MSX version
4772000	4774000	So I really want to play this
4774000	4776000	Other remake someday
4776000	4778000	I can lend it to you
4778000	4780000	Sweet
4780000	4782000	The game itself
4782000	4784000	It revolves around a fallen snake
4784000	4786000	Foxhound
4786000	4788000	Who's on a solo infiltration mission
4788000	4790000	To go into the state of Outer Heaven
4790000	4792000	And destroy Metal Gear
4792000	4794000	Which is a bipedal walking tank
4794000	4796000	It can launch nuclear missiles
4796000	4798000	Anywhere
4798000	4800000	And so that's bad
4800000	4802000	So you play around with the snake
4802000	4804000	And you have different modes
4804000	4806000	And one of them is the alert mode
4806000	4808000	Where the enemies
4808000	4810000	See where you are
4810000	4812000	So basically a snake is seen and there's only
4812000	4814000	Exclamation point over the enemy
4814000	4816000	Then
4816000	4818000	Only the enemies on the present screen
4818000	4820000	Will attack and you can just avoid them
4820000	4822000	By going to the other screen
4822000	4824000	But if two exclamation marks appear
4824000	4826000	Then they trigger an alarm
4826000	4828000	That brings in reinforcements
4828000	4830000	Which you can escape from
4830000	4832000	By killing all of the enemies
4832000	4834000	Or going outdoors or entering an elevator
4834000	4836000	You start the mission unarmed
4836000	4838000	So you can get
4838000	4840000	You know, it's on-site procurement
4840000	4842000	All of the things that you need
4842000	4844000	While you're going through there
4844000	4846000	You also have limited ammo
4846000	4848000	You have to find ammo caches
4848000	4850000	Or stealing from other people
4850000	4852000	You can also get a suppressor
4852000	4854000	That can allow you to use a handgun
4854000	4856000	And some machine gun without making a noise
4856000	4858000	Some weapons are used
4858000	4860000	To clear obstacles
4860000	4862000	Like having hollow walls
4862000	4864000	And electrified floors
4864000	4866000	You can also punch people in the face
4866000	4868000	Which is awesome
4868000	4870000	So you can also defeat
4870000	4872000	A guard by punching him in the back
4872000	4874000	Which is, I guess, the back-end
4874000	4876000	Version of the strangle that we had
4876000	4878000	In the later games
4878000	4880000	And then you also get
4880000	4882000	Different mercenaries who will
4882000	4884000	Challenge you when they're at the boss characters
4884000	4886000	In each level
4886000	4888000	So you also got multiple floors
4888000	4890000	And multiple places around here
4890000	4892000	Really the PlayStation remake
4892000	4894000	Really did a good job
4894000	4896000	Of bringing in that
4896000	4898000	That vastness that you felt in the first game
4898000	4900000	You also get a transceiver
4900000	4902000	That you can use to talk to
4902000	4904000	Your commanding officer
4904000	4906000	Big boss
4906000	4908000	Or other members of the resistance
4908000	4910000	Such as Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer
4910000	4912000	Each of his allies
4912000	4914000	Gives them certain
4914000	4916000	Tips
4916000	4918000	They specialize in different subjects
4918000	4920000	Although you don't always get a reply
4920000	4922000	When you talk to them
4922000	4924000	The MSX2 version
4924000	4926000	They used a tape recorder
4926000	4928000	To save your game progress
4928000	4930000	Or a Game Master 2 cartridge
4930000	4932000	That you would save via floppy disk
4932000	4934000	Later on, they were all stored locally
4934000	4936000	Like on memory cards and describes
4936000	4938000	So
4938000	4940000	You have different
4940000	4942000	Your bosses include Shoot Gunner
4942000	4944000	Who is renamed Shot Maker
4944000	4946000	Who is a Spetsnaz agent
4946000	4948000	Machine Gun Kid
4948000	4950000	Fire Trooper
4950000	4952000	Coward Duck
4952000	4954000	Arnold
4954000	4956000	Bloody Brad
4956000	4958000	And a couple of androids
4958000	4960000	And another mercenary
4960000	4962000	From Outer Heaven
4962000	4964000	Who you don't find out until the end
4964000	4966000	So really
4966000	4968000	It was just a pretty amazing game
4968000	4970000	I mean, it was
4970000	4972000	Kazuma was actually asked to take over the project
4972000	4974000	And it was supposed to be an action game
4974000	4976000	With modern military combat
4976000	4978000	But the MSX was really limited
4978000	4980000	In what it could do
4980000	4982000	So inspired by The Great Escape
4982000	4984000	He reversed it
4984000	4986000	To focus
4986000	4988000	To avoiding capture
4988000	4990000	And so
4990000	4992000	That's where the stealth aspect came in
4992000	4994000	The packaging
4994000	4996000	Has Solid Snake holding a gun
4996000	4998000	And it was actually traced back
4998000	5000000	To a publicity still of Michael
5000000	5002000	Bean posing as Kyle Reese for Terminator
5002000	5004000	And
5004000	5006000	Kazuma didn't take the picture
5006000	5008000	But if you go back and look at it
5008000	5010000	Even I think got the same art here in the US
5010000	5012000	But yeah
5012000	5014000	You can like, is that Michael Bean?
5014000	5016000	Is that from Terminator?
5016000	5018000	Even I thought that as a kid, you know
5018000	5020000	So
5020000	5022000	As far as different releases, we did have the
5022000	5024000	MSX2 version, we had the Famicom version
5024000	5026000	Which was of course
5026000	5028000	Completely altered
5028000	5030000	There was the MS-DOS and Commodore 64 version
5030000	5032000	They were based off the NES ones
5032000	5034000	And the MSX2 one
5034000	5036000	The subsistence
5036000	5038000	Came out and it was the re-release
5038000	5040000	Of the MSX2 one
5040000	5042000	That had an updated
5042000	5044000	Version
5044000	5046000	Original and easy difficulty settings
5046000	5048000	Name changes for characters
5048000	5050000	A boss survival mode
5050000	5052000	That you get after clearing the game
5052000	5054000	A hidden bandana item
5054000	5056000	That gives you infinite ammo
5056000	5058000	Enemy bosses
5058000	5060000	That flash red and white when they sustain damage
5060000	5062000	Snake cigarettes, drain his life gauge
5062000	5064000	Which they did in a later game
5064000	5066000	Messages
5066000	5068000	Are now displayed when the player
5068000	5070000	Attempts to pick more rations and ammunition
5070000	5072000	After reaching maximum capacity
5072000	5074000	And a result screen is added to the game
5074000	5076000	That rates your performance
5076000	5078000	It is actually
5078000	5080000	Metal Gear was
5080000	5082000	Actually one of the 20th best selling
5082000	5084000	MSX games in Japan for 5 months
5084000	5086000	And it debuted at number 4
5086000	5088000	And peaked at number 3
5088000	5090000	They said the game was rapidly
5090000	5092000	Addicting
5092000	5094000	The NES version was also
5094000	5096000	Rates number 104
5096000	5098000	In the best made Nintendo
5098000	5100000	Games of their top 200
5100000	5102000	It led to
5102000	5104000	Sequels, there was Snake's Revenge
5104000	5106000	For NES which wasn't really
5106000	5108000	In the thing
5108000	5110000	Metal Gear Solid 2 Solid Snake
5110000	5112000	Was developed by Kojima and released
5112000	5114000	In Japan for MSX2
5114000	5116000	The same year because we really
5116000	5118000	Wanted more Metal Gear
5118000	5120000	And then of course
5120000	5122000	Solid was the next one to come after that
5122000	5124000	Which honestly
5124000	5126000	I mean it was a really really
5126000	5128000	Great game. For different media
5128000	5130000	There were books that came out
5130000	5132000	There was a Metal Gear book
5132000	5134000	That was done by Scholastic Books for World of Power
5134000	5136000	There was a game book adaptation
5136000	5138000	In Japan
5138000	5140000	In the second installment of the Konami Game Book
5140000	5142000	Series. It was set years after the
5142000	5144000	Events of the game were followed because it called back
5144000	5146000	Into Fox Town to do more
5146000	5148000	Metal Gear shenanigans
5148000	5150000	There were the remakes
5150000	5152000	There's an official and an unofficial
5152000	5154000	There is a mod for Alien Swarm
5154000	5156000	That was created
5156000	5158000	By Konami with
5158000	5160000	Permission as long as they didn't make
5160000	5162000	A profit but it was cancelled on June 3, 2014
5162000	5164000	And David Hader was supposed to
5164000	5166000	Voice call a snake in it
5166000	5168000	And there's another fan remake
5168000	5170000	That's in development using Unreal Engine 4
5170000	5172000	Called Outer Heaven
5172000	5174000	And there you go
5174000	5176000	That's out of gear
5176000	5178000	Yeah this game obviously left quite a bit of a
5178000	5180000	Legacy but yeah
5180000	5182000	Seriously one of my all time favorites on the NES
5182000	5184000	Which is weird because I never got
5184000	5186000	As into the later
5186000	5188000	Metal Gear Solid series. I certainly don't have
5188000	5190000	Anything against it. I just didn't really like
5190000	5192000	Have the money
5192000	5194000	To buy or play the earlier games
5194000	5196000	Then I just kind of fell behind on the series
5196000	5198000	It's one of those things I'm always like
5198000	5200000	I'll have to get back to that on a rainy day at some point
5200000	5202000	I just never have but the original
5202000	5204000	On the NES for me because again I knew no better
5204000	5206000	As a kid about MSX or any of that stuff
5206000	5208000	Is just a true classic
5208000	5210000	I didn't even know there was a Commodore 64 version
5210000	5212000	Until you just mentioned it. That's crazy
5212000	5214000	I have to play that someday
5214000	5216000	Well and the other thing too is that
5216000	5218000	You know there is Metal Gear Solid
5218000	5220000	From Bleed
5220000	5222000	Oh yeah yeah yeah the whole Dreamcast
5222000	5224000	Thing yeah
5224000	5226000	So if you want we can lend
5226000	5228000	You our Bleedcast version
5228000	5230000	That might be fun
5230000	5232000	And the disc if you want to play through it
5232000	5234000	It might make a fun livestream at some point
5234000	5236000	Well anyway there it is
5236000	5238000	Your classic game of the week Metal Gear for the NES
5238000	5240000	Dark Sakura
5240000	5242000	We're not going to be here next week of course
5242000	5244000	Due to my trip out to Las Vegas
5244000	5246000	So that means this is the last show before the
5246000	5248000	Thanksgiving holiday so I thought I'd
5248000	5250000	Close out tonight by asking you
5250000	5252000	What are you thankful for Dark Sakura?
5252000	5254000	Um
5254000	5256000	Respirators
5256000	5258000	Music
5258000	5260000	Music
5260000	5262000	Music
5262000	5264000	Good old Dark Sakura thank you for joining us
5264000	5266000	How you can during this
5266000	5268000	Time that she's got a work conflict
5268000	5270000	Going on here. Anyway I'm back here
5270000	5272000	With Loki and it was brought up in chat
5272000	5274000	While we were listening to Jamie's segment there
5274000	5276000	It was brought up in chat that
5276000	5278000	We had not discussed Pokemon Go
5278000	5280000	During our gaming weeks like a first
5280000	5282000	But you
5282000	5284000	Okay so I'm sure you did too
5284000	5286000	Pokemon Go community day happened
5286000	5288000	I went to a new place
5288000	5290000	Because of all the smoke outside we went to the mall
5290000	5292000	Instead of the capital where we used to go
5292000	5294000	We went to a big mall out in Roseville
5294000	5296000	And actually it worked out really well
5296000	5298000	Yeah I have spotty GPS in there usually
5298000	5300000	It did bounce around
5300000	5302000	And that made it very frustrating when we tried to do
5302000	5304000	Because there's a Sprint store in there and it's an
5304000	5306000	EX eligible gym
5306000	5308000	Alan still didn't have Giratina the legacy raid
5308000	5310000	So one popped on that gym during
5310000	5312000	Community day and I was bouncing all around
5312000	5314000	It was really frustrating but we finally got it
5314000	5316000	He got his Giratina and now
5316000	5318000	We're also potentially eligible for an
5318000	5320000	EX raid out there next time
5320000	5322000	Deoxys passes go out so we'll see
5322000	5324000	I mean if they do it during the week
5324000	5326000	There's no way I can go out there but Alan
5326000	5328000	Might be able to go and get his Deoxys
5328000	5330000	So we'll see
5330000	5332000	I didn't necessarily just want to talk about Pokemon Go
5332000	5334000	Because another game that you and I have spent
5334000	5336000	An awful lot of time playing, Ingress
5336000	5338000	Went through some big changes this week as well
5338000	5340000	We didn't even really address that at the top of the show
5340000	5342000	Especially because I don't think either one of us are huge fans
5342000	5344000	Of the changes but Loki why don't you
5344000	5346000	Tell us what's going on with Ingress and what you think
5346000	5348000	So
5348000	5350000	Basically they released
5350000	5352000	The app called Ingress Prime
5352000	5354000	Which is the new
5354000	5356000	Version of the Ingress
5356000	5358000	Client I guess
5358000	5360000	They redeveloped the whole thing in Unity
5360000	5362000	So they remade it from scratch
5362000	5364000	So it looks fancier now but everything is rearranged
5364000	5366000	And I don't know if it's necessarily easier to use
5366000	5368000	I find it's not easier to use
5368000	5370000	But that's because I'm used to the old app
5370000	5372000	Yeah the muscle memory takes a long
5372000	5374000	Time to change but people who are new to it
5374000	5376000	Will probably be like oh this is fancy
5376000	5378000	You know can do that. Recharging is
5378000	5380000	Certainly a hell of a lot easier I'll give them that
5380000	5382000	Yeah so there's some things that are
5382000	5384000	There's an advantage too but
5384000	5386000	So like I don't know
5386000	5388000	I've just been having some issues with it
5388000	5390000	Because like I
5390000	5392000	Decided to get the redacted app as well
5392000	5394000	Which the redacted app is the old app
5394000	5396000	It's just kind of like in
5396000	5398000	So they upgraded the old app
5398000	5400000	Automatically to the new version
5400000	5402000	But then Niantic also said because we know the new version
5402000	5404000	Some of you are going to have some problems getting used to it
5404000	5406000	It may be buggy and stuff like that
5406000	5408000	We're going to release this new thing called Scanner Redacted
5408000	5410000	Which is the 1.0 app
5410000	5412000	But you can only use Scanner Redacted
5412000	5414000	If you had an account already
5414000	5416000	And then on top of all that
5416000	5418000	On top of all that because people are like
5418000	5420000	New Scanner, I don't know about that
5420000	5422000	They also in their store
5422000	5424000	That they've always had a store where you could
5424000	5426000	Just like you know this fake money
5426000	5428000	And you usually buy portal frackers with it
5428000	5430000	Which allows you to get double the
5430000	5432000	Output of when you hack a portal
5432000	5434000	Or you can get like little beacons and stuff
5434000	5436000	It's just crap that you put above it
5436000	5438000	You can bling out your
5438000	5440000	Portal or whatever
5440000	5442000	Sorry I have to respond to this comment in chat
5442000	5444000	Over at alive.vognetware.com
5444000	5446000	Sounds like old guys bitching
5446000	5448000	Isn't that like any gaming podcast?
5450000	5452000	Yes we are old guys
5453000	5455000	What's the problem?
5455000	5457000	To be fair he didn't say it was a problem
5457000	5459000	He just said it sounds like old guys bitching
5459000	5461000	Yes we're old guys bitching
5461000	5463000	Continue your bitching
5463000	5465000	Here's the other thing though
5465000	5467000	It's kind of like they've been having some issues
5467000	5469000	With the new scanner
5469000	5471000	For example I
5471000	5473000	Just out of the whim
5473000	5475000	Just went ahead and checked out
5475000	5477000	Oh hey let's see what this looks like
5477000	5479000	So I pulled up the
5479000	5481000	Redacted scanner
5481000	5483000	And took a look at my area
5483000	5485000	I'm like hey there's some fields here
5485000	5487000	And I put the new scanner in
5487000	5489000	And I'm like wait a second I don't see some of these fields
5489000	5491000	What the hell
5491000	5493000	And so I took screenshots of that
5493000	5495000	And there's definitely a discrepancy between that
5495000	5497000	Oh and then they have like in their store
5497000	5499000	Like I said where you can buy the portal frackers
5499000	5501000	And stuff like that which that wasn't a big deal
5501000	5503000	Because it didn't really change the game too much
5503000	5505000	Oh now you can buy
5505000	5507000	Gear in the store
5507000	5509000	Now granted
5509000	5511000	I don't know if they've dropped down like
5511000	5513000	The levels but like the gear that you can buy now
5513000	5515000	Is level 6 gear
5515000	5517000	And not you know level 8
5517000	5519000	Or level 7 or whatever it was
5519000	5521000	People were very mad about that that's for sure
5521000	5523000	So I don't know
5523000	5525000	But it's still there
5525000	5527000	Whether it's a limited amount of time
5527000	5529000	Or whatever but I
5529000	5531000	I would just like the game to be as snappy
5531000	5533000	As the old one like I don't know about you
5533000	5535000	But like when I go to make a link it is so
5535000	5537000	Slow
5537000	5539000	Like it takes forever
5539000	5541000	I love like when you actually make the link
5541000	5543000	And I love how it shows what it will look like
5543000	5545000	Like there are improvements that I really like
5545000	5547000	But just like oh my god it's so slow
5547000	5549000	But you know the thing that they're teasing us
5549000	5551000	Because you know I just hit max level in Ingress over the summer
5551000	5553000	So you know what they're teasing us with now right
5553000	5555000	So they put in this
5555000	5557000	So the question was always going to be
5557000	5559000	Is Ingress going to put in levels above 16
5559000	5561000	And it looks like the answer is no
5561000	5563000	What they are going to do is
5563000	5565000	Recursion
5565000	5567000	Recursive Ingress
5567000	5569000	So now that you know hooray
5569000	5571000	I spent four and a half years
5571000	5573000	To hit max level in Ingress
5573000	5575000	And Ingress is now like bitch you thought
5575000	5577000	Now you can Recurse and go all the way back to level 1
5577000	5579000	And it's like prestige
5579000	5581000	Right
5581000	5583000	Basically they brought the prestige system into
5583000	5585000	Ingress
5585000	5587000	So I'm going to do it
5587000	5589000	But it's just
5589000	5591000	Like a lot of people on my team are doing it
5591000	5593000	And I was kind of sitting there going
5593000	5595000	I don't think this is a good idea
5595000	5597000	For the entire team to reset
5597000	5599000	To level 1 at the same time
5599000	5601000	So I'm going to wait a little bit
5601000	5603000	Until some of you get up in level
5603000	5605000	And in case any gigantic
5605000	5607000	Blue fields go up over town
5607000	5609000	Like somebody can
5609000	5611000	Respond to it
5611000	5613000	Because I didn't think it was perhaps the greatest idea
5613000	5615000	For the entire team to Recurse all at once
5615000	5617000	But that's exactly what happened which kind of cracked me up
5617000	5619000	I think they should all Recurse
5619000	5621000	Well eventually they probably will
5621000	5623000	So
5623000	5625000	Siya Tabiri says Ingress new game plus
5625000	5627000	That's kind of what it is
5627000	5629000	Kind of what a new game plus
5629000	5631000	So anyway
5631000	5633000	Yeah the Ingress Prime
5633000	5635000	Client is just bugging me right now
5635000	5637000	But like I'm excited what it will look like in 3 months
5637000	5639000	Once they've been able to bug fix it
5639000	5641000	Because clearly
5641000	5643000	God this thing has been in development for a while
5643000	5645000	And clearly whatever beta they had wasn't enough to bug fix it
5645000	5647000	So it'll be, it's weird too
5647000	5649000	They're taking all their bug feedback through
5649000	5651000	Reddit
5651000	5653000	So you can go to reddit.com
5653000	5655000	Slash r slash Ingress Prime feedback
5655000	5657000	And that's like the unofficial
5657000	5659000	But official Ingress Prime feedback forum
5659000	5661000	It's weird
5661000	5663000	Anyway, alright we'll stop bitching
5663000	5665000	About a mobile phone game and we'll get
5665000	5667000	Back into some rapid fire news
5667000	5669000	Loki, what do you want to talk about for rapid fire news tonight?
5669000	5671000	Alright well this is kind of a cool
5671000	5673000	Freebie with the whole announcement
5673000	5675000	Of the release date of Crackdown 3
5675000	5677000	Microsoft is giving away
5677000	5679000	Crackdown, free for this month
5679000	5681000	So go download it
5681000	5683000	Or go add it to your library even though I
5683000	5685000	Already have it
5685000	5687000	But you can do it
5687000	5689000	Anyways
5689000	5691000	So go do it
5691000	5693000	If you don't already, it's a fun game
5693000	5695000	Find those orbs
5695000	5697000	And then of course
5697000	5699000	With no
5699000	5701000	PlayStation event around the corner
5701000	5703000	We have to look forward to of course
5703000	5705000	The Game Awards 2018
5705000	5707000	That's the largest lineup of new game
5707000	5709000	Announcements in the show's history
5709000	5711000	Which they had a lot of announcements
5711000	5713000	Before so I'm curious to see what they're
5713000	5715000	Going to show off this year
5715000	5717000	It's going to take place 6th of
5717000	5719000	December
5719000	5721000	So we'll have to find out
5721000	5723000	What's going to be there, obviously
5723000	5725000	Kojima's going to be there in print
5725000	5727000	Well the fact that they don't have a PlayStation
5727000	5729000	Experience this year kind of means I think
5729000	5731000	Some of those announcements will roll over to this
5731000	5733000	So I think that's probably one reason why they're
5733000	5735000	Having a really good year for announcements is because
5735000	5737000	There's no PlayStation experience
5737000	5739000	And then
5739000	5741000	Microsoft didn't really like
5741000	5743000	Bring the house down with anything
5743000	5745000	Besides the studio acquisitions
5745000	5747000	They announced that X018
5747000	5749000	Was a big deal but they didn't really do
5749000	5751000	Any new game announcements so even
5751000	5753000	Out of Microsoft's camp they might have
5753000	5755000	Something in store for Game Rewards which could be interesting
5755000	5757000	And the Game Awards they said the
5757000	5759000	Cut off is going to be
5759000	5761000	Mid November
5761000	5763000	I'm like well yeah
5763000	5765000	Smash comes out like a couple of days before
5765000	5767000	Yeah no it sucks but Smash is not
5767000	5769000	Going to be eligible but Tetris Effect is
5769000	5771000	I'm just saying
5771000	5773000	We all know Red Red Redemption and God of War
5773000	5775000	Is going to win everything anyway but I hope
5775000	5777000	Tetris Effect gets like
5777000	5779000	Is there a category for pretty?
5779000	5781000	There's music
5781000	5783000	Yeah it seems like a shoo-in for music that's for sure
5783000	5785000	Alright well heading
5785000	5787000	Over to the Nintendo Switch
5787000	5789000	And it's online system
5789000	5791000	Of course the Nintendo Switch online
5791000	5793000	That's something they're updating monthly with
5793000	5795000	New games so November's
5795000	5797000	Games are on their way they will be out on
5797000	5799000	November 14th and that is when
5799000	5801000	Twinbee, Mighty Bomb Jack
5801000	5803000	And Metroid will be released that is what
5803000	5805000	Nintendo announced the specific day for that this week
5805000	5807000	Obviously I know I'm very excited about
5807000	5809000	Metroid. Mighty Bomb Jack
5809000	5811000	In my opinion was kind of garbage
5811000	5813000	Especially compared to the original Bomb Jack
5813000	5815000	Arcade game. Twinbee is
5815000	5817000	A very interesting pick because we got that
5817000	5819000	Here in the US is Stinger
5819000	5821000	But my understanding is we are getting
5821000	5823000	Twinbee so it's going to be like the Japanese
5823000	5825000	Version basically
5825000	5827000	No word yet if there might be a bonus
5827000	5829000	Thing because Nintendo did
5829000	5831000	No announcement or ramp up
5831000	5833000	For that Zelda
5833000	5835000	What the hell did they call it? The Zelda
5835000	5837000	You can buy everything now or whatever the hell
5837000	5839000	It was called. Zelda Easy Mode
5839000	5841000	Basically so it would be interesting
5841000	5843000	Maybe if Metroid gets something like that or maybe
5843000	5845000	One of the other games that already exist
5845000	5847000	They should totally I mean I know
5847000	5849000	It's so against you know their
5849000	5851000	I don't know
5851000	5853000	Mantra but they should totally
5853000	5855000	Put Game Genie support back in those games
5855000	5857000	Because that would be awesome
5857000	5859000	I know that Game Genie
5859000	5861000	Wasn't necessarily
5861000	5863000	Their thing but I mean
5863000	5865000	It would be nice
5865000	5867000	Twinbee was never released in the US I thought it was
5867000	5869000	Stinger
5869000	5871000	I thought they renamed it and put it out here
5871000	5873000	They probably changed it a bit too
5873000	5875000	In Light Force or something
5875000	5877000	Oh OrangeRite says Stinger was Twinbee
5877000	5879000	Too oh my bad I thought that's how
5879000	5881000	It worked okay thank you OrangeRite
5881000	5883000	Alright
5883000	5885000	Anyhow other news out of
5885000	5887000	Nintendo include a Super Smash

5963000	5965000	Even though that's been out for a little bit
5965000	5967000	I'm sure Nintendo would love to see that show up
5967000	5969000	Under lots of Christmas trees
5969000	5971000	And menorahs everywhere
5971000	5973000	Yeah it's true
5973000	5975000	Going in chat over at
5975000	5977000	Live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf
5977000	5979000	Talking about that mall says
5979000	5981000	That's where I used to play Drummania in the early 2000's
5981000	5983000	They had a Percussions Freaks 4th
5983000	5985000	Mix at the Vans Skatepark
5985000	5987000	I was the guy playing that
5987000	5989000	While everyone else was playing DDR
5989000	5991000	I had all the high scores there
5991000	5993000	And you turned that into actual
5993000	5995000	Drumming
5995000	5997000	I'm sure it had
5997000	5999000	Nothing to do with your actual drumming experience
5999000	6001000	Lending itself very well to
6001000	6003000	Drummania or Percussion Freaks as the case may be
6003000	6005000	Alright anyhow let's move
6005000	6007000	On to release dates and travel
6007000	6009000	Around the world and check out what is coming out

6103000	6105000	And check out some releases coming out over there
6105000	6107000	Even though of course the shopping seasons are not
6107000	6109000	Quite the same over there
6109000	6111000	But I do believe they have some releases
6111000	6113000	This week in Japan, yes on the PlayStation 4
6113000	6115000	Yuna and the Haunted Hot Springs
6115000	6117000	Steam Dungeon
6117000	6119000	That is in a
6119000	6121000	Regular and a limited edition
6121000	6123000	Just so we're clear
6123000	6125000	What's in the limited edition?
6125000	6127000	Limited Things
6127000	6129000	What's the dungeon crawler?
6129000	6131000	Actually you're exactly right
6131000	6133000	It is a dungeon crawler
6133000	6135000	So it's not just a clever name
6135000	6137000	It looks like it might be cute
6137000	6139000	But I doubt it will ever come out over here
6139000	6141000	RPG Maker MV Trinity
6141000	6143000	Is out in Japan this week
6143000	6145000	On November 15th

6295000	6297000	Very excited, you know, sometimes
6297000	6299000	Sometimes I'm sitting here going, no emails
6299000	6301000	Womp womp
6301000	6303000	It was because of the RuPaul Drag Race talk
6303000	6305000	They did it, it did the trick
6305000	6307000	I guilted, no we got a lot of emails tonight
6307000	6309000	I'm actually thrilled, so we have a lot of stuff to talk about
6309000	6311000	We have four emails, for us
6311000	6313000	For us, that is an avalanche, I'm excited
6313000	6315000	So let's get into it
6315000	6317000	You can always send us an email, participate at
6317000	6319000	Orangeloungeradio.com
6319000	6321000	First email tonight from Martin
6321000	6323000	Our friendly neighborhood, Belgian
6323000	6325000	And it's going to be talking about a subject
6325000	6327000	That we've already discussed a little bit tonight
6327000	6329000	But let's get Martin's take on it
6329000	6331000	So hello LR, your friendly Belgian Martin here
6331000	6333000	Just wanted to talk to you about
6333000	6335000	EA's Battlefield 5 release date shenanigans
6335000	6337000	The following is what release schedule looks like
6337000	6339000	EA Access basic subscribers
6339000	6341000	For $5 a month
6341000	6343000	Get to play 10 hour trial
6343000	6345000	From November 9
6345000	6347000	EA Access premier subscribers
6347000	6349000	For $15 a month get to play the full game November 9
6349000	6351000	Pre-orders of the deluxe edition
6351000	6353000	$80 get to play November 15
6353000	6355000	Regular people who just buy the game
6355000	6357000	$60 get to play November 20
6357000	6359000	So let me get this straight
6359000	6361000	I paid $60 for the basic version of the game
6361000	6363000	And I have to wait almost two weeks
6363000	6365000	After release to play
6365000	6367000	Even if you've pre-ordered the deluxe version of the game
6367000	6369000	For $80 you still have to wait a week
6369000	6371000	Sure they call it early access for origin subscribers
6371000	6373000	But let's face it
6373000	6375000	The game is finished, it's out
6375000	6377000	They're just delaying release
6377000	6379000	Unless you pay up more money
6379000	6381000	I find it very obnoxious
6381000	6383000	And I believe it harms the player base in the long run
6383000	6385000	Keep up the great show, take care
6385000	6387000	Martin from Belgium
6387000	6389000	Thank you so much for the email as always
6389000	6391000	This has been something they've been doing for a while
6391000	6393000	Granted this is a little worse
6393000	6395000	But before they had the whole EA
6395000	6397000	Access thing with
6397000	6399000	The consoles where they would allow you
6399000	6401000	To play the game a few days earlier
6401000	6403000	Before release
6403000	6405000	Martin here's my opinion straight up
6405000	6407000	This system killed
6407000	6409000	Mass Effect Andromeda
6409000	6411000	So why EA is still doing it
6411000	6413000	Is beyond me
6413000	6415000	And I say it killed Mass Effect Andromeda
6415000	6417000	Because when they put it out on early access
6417000	6419000	That's when suddenly it was like
6419000	6421000	Oh my god look at all these graphical bugs
6421000	6423000	When in reality the graphical bugs
6423000	6425000	Were like honestly it wasn't
6425000	6427000	It was probably better than most Bethesda games
6427000	6429000	But Bethesda doesn't do this
6429000	6431000	The problem is they take those
6431000	6433000	They take those micro clips
6433000	6435000	Those seconds
6436000	6438000	And it's look at what a garbage game
6438000	6440000	Mass Effect Andromeda is
6440000	6442000	And it ruined it
6442000	6444000	And it was because of this fuckery
6444000	6446000	So why EA is continuing to do it
6446000	6448000	Kind of blows my fucking mind
6448000	6450000	But I guess Battlefield
6450000	6452000	Is a very different type of game
6452000	6454000	And as I kind of referenced earlier in the show
6454000	6456000	If they have 100% confidence
6456000	6458000	That Twitter isn't going to be filled with all these
6458000	6460000	Hot takes on fuck ups in the game
6460000	6462000	Then I guess they can get away with it
6462000	6464000	But at the end of the day
6464000	6466000	Money talks
6466000	6468000	So if you pay for it
6468000	6470000	They're going to do it again
6470000	6472000	It's only really an option
6472000	6474000	The origin thing is only an option if you're on PC anyway
6474000	6476000	So if you don't have a PC that can run these games
6476000	6478000	Then you're kind of out of luck
6478000	6480000	Unless you do just the EA
6480000	6482000	I don't even know if they're still doing their Game Pass type thing
6482000	6484000	Does this open it up to piracy?
6484000	6486000	That's the other kind of thing
6486000	6488000	I'm surprised these games don't get ripped apart
6488000	6490000	I assume there must be some component of the cloud
6490000	6492000	The online service
6492000	6494000	That's totally possible
6494000	6496000	I wouldn't probably say that
6496000	6498000	I mean, I know
6498000	6500000	Hackers going to hack, right?
6500000	6502000	But I'm kind of surprised with the PC version
6502000	6504000	It doesn't open itself up to piracy
6504000	6506000	There must be enough of it that relies on the online piece
6506000	6508000	That you can't yank it off the EA access servers
6508000	6510000	I wouldn't say that
6510000	6512000	Because it's already on the torrent sites
6512000	6514000	So, uh, yeah
6514000	6516000	So, I would question EA's
6516000	6518000	I mean, I would never advocate for piracy
6518000	6520000	I'm not saying to pirate it
6520000	6522000	But I'm just surprised
6522000	6524000	That when that becomes a factor
6524000	6526000	That EA still kind of lets this happen
6526000	6528000	Maybe they haven't cracked it yet
6528000	6530000	But they've got it out there
6530000	6532000	But let's be real guys
6532000	6534000	This could be a place the industry is headed
6534000	6536000	It's not unique to EA
6536000	6538000	Microsoft just did it with Forza
6538000	6540000	Did they not?
6540000	6542000	It's happened before
6542000	6544000	If you don't like it, don't buy it
6544000	6546000	I implore you, no matter what the game is
6546000	6548000	No matter what it is
6548000	6550000	Now, let's go on to another email from Elliot B
6550000	6552000	Who we haven't heard from in a while
6552000	6554000	It's very good to hear from you, Elliot
6554000	6558000	Hey, OLR, I can't decide whether to get excited about Pokemon Go or not
6558000	6560000	I've bought almost every generation of Pokemon
6560000	6562000	I think he means Pokemon Let's Go
6562000	6564000	Because that's where the rest of this email goes
6564000	6566000	I've bought almost every generation of Pokemon
6566000	6568000	All the way back to Blue
6568000	6570000	And sunk over 100 hours into Sapphire
6570000	6572000	But every game since
6572000	6574000	I get bored of the same old mechanics halfway through
6574000	6576000	I'm hoping that the Pokemon Let's Go games
6576000	6578000	Add some fresh ideas
6578000	6580000	That don't just feel like throwaway novelties
6580000	6582000	What do you guys think?
6582000	6584000	Will you pick it up?
6584000	6586000	I'm especially interested to hear Rob's opinion
6586000	6588000	As a dedicated Pokemon Go player
6588000	6590000	Elliot B, thank you
6590000	6592000	And here's my opinion
6592000	6594000	I am really psyched about it
6594000	6596000	I'm jazzed about it, to play it
6596000	6598000	Because in my opinion
6598000	6600000	The grind for hunting in the grass
6600000	6602000	For a particular Pokemon
6602000	6604000	And doing the random encounter battles
6604000	6606000	Starts to feel really grindy
6606000	6608000	And that's where the Pokemon games start to lose me
6608000	6610000	I understand some people are really into that
6610000	6612000	And that's cool
6612000	6614000	But I do have that part of my brain that's like
6614000	6616000	No, you have to catch them all
6616000	6618000	Before you move on, even as much as
6618000	6620000	Shane and other Pokemon fans
6620000	6622000	That I know tell me, Rob, don't do that to yourself
6622000	6624000	You should just ruin the game for yourself
6624000	6626000	And I always inevitably ruin it for myself
6626000	6628000	So my point is, the fact that they've
6628000	6630000	Replaced that kind of grinding
6630000	6632000	With a
6632000	6634000	Ball tossing
6634000	6636000	Kind of like different style that they've taken
6636000	6638000	Out of Pokemon Go, the mobile game
6638000	6640000	Yeah, that does seem really appealing to me
6640000	6642000	Because they've taken out a lot of the grinding
6642000	6644000	Well, and this will be my first traditional
6644000	6646000	Pokemon game, because I only play Pokemon
6646000	6648000	Technically, I mean
6648000	6650000	If we want to get technical, it is not part of the
6650000	6652000	Mainline series, it is a side game
6652000	6654000	It's like a remake of the first
6654000	6656000	But you know if this sells well
6656000	6658000	We'll have Pokemon Let's Go
6658000	6660000	You know
6660000	6662000	Espeon and Umbreon
6662000	6664000	You know, stuff from the second generation
6664000	6666000	So that'll be
6666000	6668000	Inevitable
6668000	6670000	Let's go Magikarp
6670000	6672000	I'm sure a lot of people will be into that
6672000	6674000	SSJ100Matt in chat says
6674000	6676000	Meanwhile, Shane is buying both versions
6676000	6678000	Oh, I'm sure
6678000	6680000	He has a man now, so I'm pretty sure
6680000	6682000	He's buying one for him and one for his man
6682000	6684000	And they can trade with each other
6684000	6686000	Probably buying the two consoles too
6686000	6688000	At least one of them, I'm sure
6689000	6691000	I don't know, I'll text him in a little bit if y'all
6691000	6693000	Really want to know an update, but you can safely assume
6693000	6695000	He's buying more than one copy
6695000	6697000	I am only buying one copy
6697000	6699000	I got Let's Go Pikachu
6699000	6701000	Because when I was kind of doing an informal
6701000	6703000	Assessment on my Twitter feed, it seemed like everybody
6703000	6705000	Was going Eevee
6705000	6707000	I don't know what the difference is aside from your starting Pokemon
6707000	6709000	Is there really a big difference?
6709000	6711000	Well, if it's like Red and Blue, there will be
6711000	6713000	Pokemon that you can't catch
6713000	6715000	In one that you can in the other
6715000	6717000	Like, I don't remember what Pokemon
6717000	6719000	Didn't cross over
6719000	6721000	I want to say like Ekans
6721000	6723000	And, um
6723000	6725000	Arbok were exclusive to one
6725000	6727000	And then like
6727000	6729000	Paras might have been in the other
6729000	6731000	I don't remember, but there are certain Pokemon
6731000	6733000	That don't show up
6733000	6735000	If it's like Red and Blue, which is my assumption
6735000	6737000	But can I just take those from Pokemon Go
6737000	6739000	And just transfer them into the game or something like that?
6739000	6741000	Well, you trade them, you trade them with friends
6741000	6743000	That was the whole thing
6743000	6745000	You had a friend with Pokemon Blue
6746000	6748000	And then you could trade them into your game
6748000	6750000	Because either game had all the Pokemon in it
6750000	6752000	Just like now that they're up to like
6752000	6754000	Gen 7
6754000	6756000	And probably why these games take a while to work on
6756000	6758000	Is that with the Pokemon Bank
6758000	6760000	You can get Pokemon all the way back
6760000	6762000	From the earliest gens
6762000	6764000	And import them into
6764000	6766000	The newest Pokemon Sun and Moon
6766000	6768000	And I'm sure the Pokemon Bank
6768000	6770000	Will be supported by
6770000	6772000	The Switch Pokemon, which will be Gen 8
6772000	6774000	Which will be the next mainline Pokemon game
6774000	6776000	Assumably as next holiday
6776000	6778000	And this game is supposed to be like the holdover
6778000	6780000	This is the tied you over title
6780000	6782000	Which is fine
6782000	6784000	I think it's a very interesting direction
6784000	6786000	I'm really hoping it's
6786000	6788000	Yeah, I'm really hoping it's going to be good
6788000	6790000	Some folks in chat reminding me
6790000	6792000	Sia Tabiri says Bellsprout was exclusive to Blue
6792000	6794000	Sia Tabiri says
6794000	6796000	I think Meowth was exclusive to Blue
6796000	6798000	Some other comments in chat
6798000	6800000	S2100mat suggests
6800000	6802000	Let's go Bidoof
6802000	6804000	No one can play that, are you kidding?
6804000	6806000	I love Bidoof
6806000	6808000	I got more excited
6808000	6810000	On community day when those bunnyries
6810000	6812000	Showed up, the little bunnies
6812000	6814000	The bunnies
6814000	6816000	When did they show up?
6816000	6818000	At the mall, they were just randomly
6818000	6820000	Caught like three of them on just random pokestops
6820000	6822000	And I was more excited about that
6822000	6824000	Yeah, I finally evolved one of those
6824000	6826000	And I got a shiny
6826000	6828000	Whatever that thing was
6828000	6830000	I don't know, I didn't really need it
6830000	6832000	I didn't get my
6832000	6834000	My enlightened
6834000	6836000	Pokemon, though
6836000	6838000	I got the stupid
6838000	6840000	Ponyta that was shiny
6840000	6842000	But I didn't get a shiny Cubone
6842000	6844000	And I was very disappointed
6844000	6846000	Because I have a horse named Smurf
6846000	6848000	I didn't get either one, sadly
6848000	6850000	But you get the shirts
6850000	6852000	If you look in the story
6852000	6854000	You do the shirts, that's cool
6854000	6856000	Ponyta is shiny
6856000	6858000	I hate that that's a resistance thing
6859000	6861000	It evolved it too
6861000	6863000	It dulls out even
6863000	6865000	I like the color better when it's a Ponyta
6865000	6867000	It still looks cool though
6867000	6869000	I still like it
6869000	6871000	Thank you Elliot, great email
6871000	6873000	Appreciate hearing from you, hope you're well
6873000	6875000	Next email from Dark Tetsuya
6875000	6877000	We love hearing from Dark Tetsuya
6877000	6879000	And Dark Tetsuya is giving us a game review tonight
6879000	6881000	Hey OLR, so a funny thing happened this week
6881000	6883000	Destructoid was giving away copies of a new
6883000	6885000	Download title for Nintendo Switch
6885000	6887000	It's also on Steam
6887000	6889000	As luck would have it, I was one of the winners
6889000	6891000	So I got to try this game out
6891000	6893000	So this game is from Flying Tiger and G-Mode
6893000	6895000	Who you might remember them from the Data East
6895000	6897000	Arcade line by Johnny Turbo
6897000	6899000	Who as an aside was based on a real person
6899000	6901000	If you've ever read those weird comments they had
6901000	6903000	For the TurboGrafx-16 CD
6903000	6905000	That appeared in game magazines back in the day
6905000	6908000	And came out on Switch and PC a couple weeks ago
6908000	6910000	The game itself is an interesting concept
6910000	6912000	They've taken some of the old graphics and sound
6912000	6914000	Assets from the classic arcade games
6914000	6916000	And turned it into a team based
6916000	6918000	Competition twin stick shooter
6918000	6920000	Almost like Smash TV
6920000	6922000	You and a friend playing as BurgerTime star Peter
6922000	6924000	Pepper compete in a two on two
6924000	6926000	Game to take on the bag of money
6926000	6928000	And run it into your opponent's goal
6928000	6930000	But you'll have to traverse several screens
6930000	6932000	Inspired by some of the Data East Arcade
6932000	6934000	Classics like Heavy Barrel, Bad Dudes
6934000	6936000	And Karate Champ
6936000	6938000	Each with its own themed stage hazards
6938000	6940000	Like enemies and billiard balls
6940000	6942000	Although I have to say the single player challenges
6942000	6944000	Get insanely hard at times
6944000	6946000	This is definitely more of a party game
6946000	6948000	To get all your friends together and try to get to the goal
6948000	6950000	Before the other team does
6950000	6952000	So I'd really only recommend this one if you have friends over
6952000	6954000	Or take your system to parties or something
6954000	6956000	This is definitely more a multiplayer experience
6956000	6958000	Especially considering it's 20 bucks
6958000	6960000	On Switch
6960000	6962000	Well thank you for the game review
6962000	6964000	This was not a game on my radar
6964000	6966000	But you know I'm a sucker for retro games
6966000	6968000	And I love it when they take like retro stuff
6968000	6970000	And make new things out of it
6970000	6972000	Like NES Remix right?
6972000	6974000	I don't know what they're doing here
6974000	6976000	It's kind of like a hodgepodge of the Data East games
6976000	6978000	So that's cool
6978000	6980000	Yeah, fun
6980000	6982000	Alright, one more email for us tonight
6982000	6984000	From Frodo Swagons
6984000	6986000	Who says, Frodo Swagons here
6986000	6988000	I haven't owned a ton of gaming consoles
6988000	6990000	But when I think back at the ones
6990000	6992000	I have purchased or experienced
6992000	6994000	When I think of a specific console
6994000	6996000	I always have a few favorite games
6996000	6998000	That come straight to mind
6998000	7000000	Like my personal classics
7000000	7002000	I was wondering what are all of your favorite games
7002000	7004000	When you name off your consoles
7004000	7006000	Minar for Nintendo 64
7006000	7008000	Cruisin USA, GoldenEye, Pokemon Snap
7008000	7010000	Ken Griffey Baseball, Mario 64
7010000	7012000	PlayStation
7012000	7014000	Jet Moto, Kirby, Tomb Raider
7014000	7016000	Space Jam, Crash Bandicoot
7016000	7018000	PC, Roller Coaster Tycoon
7018000	7020000	Carmageddon, Doom
7020000	7022000	Xbox, 007 Nightfire
7022000	7024000	NASCAR 99, Unreal Championship
7024000	7026000	Test Drive, Fusion Frenzy
7026000	7028000	Outlaw Golf
7028000	7030000	The games that you, not necessarily
7030000	7032000	The best games on the system
7032000	7034000	Not necessarily the critical darlings
7034000	7036000	But what are the games that you
7036000	7038000	Are always going to associate with a particular system?
7038000	7040000	Loki, you want to dive into that
7040000	7042000	Like Frodo Swagons said, thanks for the email
7042000	7044000	I don't know, that's a lot
7044000	7046000	But with PC games, I wouldn't even think about it like that
7046000	7048000	I think about it as the different PCs I've owned
7048000	7050000	Because
7050000	7052000	It's going to be different
7052000	7054000	The PC is way too big
7054000	7056000	I'd say one of my first PCs
7056000	7058000	It would have to be Wolfenstein 3D
7060000	7062000	What the hell are they playing on there?
7062000	7064000	I remember this original X-Men game
7064000	7066000	That I really liked on my old, old PC
7066000	7068000	The Sierra games
7068000	7070000	I think that was later though, because we had CD-Raw
7070000	7072000	No, I had
7072000	7074000	The Secret of Monkey Island
7074000	7076000	And then of course
7076000	7078000	What was something else?
7078000	7080000	Click and Play
7080000	7082000	No, I didn't have Click and Play on that PC
7082000	7084000	Oh
7084000	7086000	Space Quest 4
7086000	7088000	Was another one they had on there
7088000	7090000	And then of course
7090000	7092000	More modern
7092000	7094000	The PC after that
7094000	7096000	The next one we got was probably
7096000	7098000	ZZT
7098000	7100000	Fuck yeah, ZZT
7100000	7102000	Yeah, so ZZT, Click and Play
7106000	7108000	Scorched Earth, Red Alert
7108000	7110000	Would have been something I played
7110000	7112000	A lot of on there
7112000	7114000	I'll take on some of the consoles
7114000	7116000	So like for the NES
7116000	7118000	The Guardian Legend, I'm always going to associate
7118000	7120000	The Legend of Zelda, the original
7120000	7122000	For sure
7122000	7124000	Mario Bros. 3, Mario Bros. 2
7124000	7126000	So I stayed up all night playing both those games
7126000	7128000	I remember renting Mario Bros. 2
7128000	7130000	On New Year's Eve
7130000	7132000	Because the place would be closed on New Year's Day
7132000	7134000	So you got an extra day for free
7134000	7136000	So I remember getting in there and getting that Mario Bros. 2 copy that day
7136000	7138000	And I actually have a lot of memories playing
7138000	7140000	Star Tropics as well
7140000	7142000	If I had played that game again today, I wouldn't remember my way through it
7142000	7144000	Because I tried on the NES Classic
7144000	7146000	And Metroid
7146000	7148000	Because with the Super Nintendo, obviously you know I'm going to say Super Metroid
7148000	7150000	But I'd also say
7150000	7152000	Honestly, like some deeper cuts
7152000	7154000	Equinox was always a favorite game of mine on that system
7154000	7156000	Draken, just because that was the game I got
7156000	7158000	As a launch title
7158000	7160000	When my parents bought me the Super Nintendo
7160000	7162000	They bought that game because the guy at Montgomery Ward
7162000	7164000	Recommended it to them
7164000	7166000	That is a true story
7166000	7168000	And then
7168000	7170000	I'd also say with Super Nintendo
7170000	7172000	I was on the tip of my tongue and I forgot
7172000	7174000	Final Fantasy 3
7174000	7176000	Which we all know is really 6
7176000	7178000	But it was 3 when it came out
7178000	7180000	PlayStation was during my college years
7180000	7182000	So I missed out on a lot of it
7182000	7184000	But for sure Final Fantasy 7
7184000	7186000	Because I played the shit out of that when it was released
7186000	7188000	Super Puzzle Fighter 2
7188000	7190000	I played a lot of that game
7190000	7192000	And other puzzlers too
7192000	7194000	Like Intelligent Cube
7194000	7196000	Played a bit of that
7196000	7198000	Those are some games I would always associate with PlayStation
7198000	7200000	And yeah, I think
7200000	7202000	I think I've said enough
7202000	7204000	Well, when it comes to the original PlayStation
7204000	7206000	I've got to, you know, talk about
7206000	7208000	DDR
7208000	7210000	Yeah, oh for sure
7210000	7212000	We had the mod chip, well, mod cart
7212000	7214000	I guess
7214000	7216000	Used to play all that stuff in there
7216000	7218000	Gosh, I don't know
7218000	7220000	The Jungle Book Dancing Game
7220000	7222000	Because that was the gateway drug into
7222000	7224000	The Jungle Book Dancing Game
7224000	7226000	Because that was the gateway drug into
7226000	7228000	DDR, getting a dance mat in the US
7228000	7230000	Remember? Who knows? I didn't say they were good
7230000	7232000	It's just games you associate
7232000	7234000	Alright, thank you for the email FrodoSwagons
7234000	7236000	It's always fun to take a walk down memory lane
7236000	7238000	Looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com
7238000	7240000	Sia Tabiri says for the NES
7240000	7242000	Mario 2, Mario 3, Dragon Spirit
7242000	7244000	Little Nemo, Dream Master
7244000	7246000	Dartitsia says for the PlayStation
7246000	7248000	Parappa the Rappa, that's a good one
7248000	7250000	Akuma JP says Einhander
7250000	7252000	on my PlayStation
7252000	7254000	So yeah, good answers you guys
7254000	7256000	Alright, and to follow up on the previous
7256000	7258000	email, the question was asked
7258000	7260000	How many copies of Pokemon Let's
7260000	7262000	Go did Shane get? So I texted
7262000	7264000	him, and he texted me back
7264000	7266000	Here you go
7266000	7268000	So far, one copy of both
7268000	7270000	Eevee and Pikachu, Pokeball
7270000	7272000	Plus bundles, so two
7272000	7274000	And the Pikachu System
7274000	7276000	bundle, so three, so far
7276000	7278000	Oh, and his boyfriend
7278000	7280000	technically is getting the Eevee
7280000	7282000	Pokeball Plus bundle from me
7282000	7284000	So four. We just pre-ordered
7284000	7286000	four of the Pokeball chargers too
7286000	7288000	So there you go
7288000	7290000	He needs to offload some copies of the game
7290000	7292000	I'll take one of them because I haven't
7292000	7294000	purchased one yet, and I mean, just saying
7294000	7296000	You don't need multiple copies of the same game
7296000	7298000	It's, it's, I
7298000	7300000	You know what, like, y'all wanna give me shit
7300000	7302000	for buying Mass Effect 3 multiple, or my fourth
7302000	7304000	copy of Diablo 3 on Switch, but
7304000	7306000	I'm just saying, I'll take a copy of his
7306000	7308000	Pikachu one, but, um
7308000	7310000	I'm just gonna go buy one, so I mean, might as well
7310000	7312000	It sounds like SSJ100Matt
7312000	7314000	won the bet in chat, I told you four
7314000	7316000	Dardisius says, yeah, you called it
7316000	7318000	And AkumaJP says, damn, hardcore
7318000	7320000	But, I mean, this is not, like
7320000	7322000	Shane loves Pokemon, he trades himself
7322000	7324000	That's what he does. Whatever, you like
7324000	7326000	something, I'm not gonna
7326000	7328000	You spend your money however the hell you want
7328000	7330000	I like DDR, I bought a goddamn machine
7330000	7332000	I have no room to talk
7332000	7334000	Hey man, you have no room to talk, that's fine
7334000	7336000	Alright, but there's the answer to the question
7336000	7338000	Alright, let's move on, we have some
7338000	7340000	more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to your calls
7340000	7342000	at OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word
7342000	7344000	on Skype, but first some news, Loki
7344000	7346000	So you may remember there's some games that
7346000	7348000	Japan's been getting that run on the
7348000	7350000	Switch that may not necessarily run on the Switch
7350000	7352000	over here, because, well, they're streaming
7352000	7354000	games, and so
7354000	7356000	Capcom was one of those that kind of
7356000	7358000	experimented with that, with Resident Evil 7
7358000	7360000	the Switch version, of course, you may remember
7360000	7362000	Ubisoft did the same thing with
7362000	7364000	the new Assassin's Creed game
7364000	7366000	but apparently they've had some actual
7366000	7368000	success with the
7368000	7370000	Switch version of Resident Evil 7
7370000	7372000	to the point where they're actually considering
7372000	7374000	on furthering
7374000	7376000	or to do some more of that
7376000	7378000	so, they're saying that, you know
7378000	7380000	after the success
7380000	7382000	of the
7382000	7384000	Resident Evil 7
7384000	7386000	there was
7386000	7388000	they did the fact that there was a
7388000	7390000	significant impact
7390000	7392000	you know, with the interest in that
7394000	7396000	that they're gonna probably try some other games
7396000	7398000	and while we did release this
7398000	7400000	certain title, Supporting Cloud Gaming
7400000	7402000	in the first half, this was done primarily
7402000	7404000	for technology, or technological research
7404000	7406000	purposes, and did not have a
7406000	7408000	significant impact on earnings
7408000	7410000	based on the results of the
7410000	7412000	research, we internally considered
7412000	7414000	future expansion to cloud gaming, so
7414000	7416000	apparently
7416000	7418000	that might be something we'll see a little bit more
7418000	7420000	in Switch, and maybe even something that we'll see
7420000	7422000	leave just Japan, and
7422000	7424000	not, you know
7424000	7426000	venture into other regions as well
7426000	7428000	so, I'm curious
7428000	7430000	to see
7430000	7432000	where this kind of goes
7448000	7450000	they're gonna get a return on their investment
7450000	7452000	that's worthwhile
7452000	7454000	I don't know, they don't really have any huge
7454000	7456000	upcoming games, I think, that would really
7456000	7458000	benefit from something like this, because right now
7458000	7460000	the stuff that they've released over here
7460000	7462000	recently, it's been like fighting games
7462000	7464000	and stuff like that, that probably wouldn't be something you'd want to stream
7464000	7466000	bonds006
7466000	7468000	in chat sums this up, saying
7468000	7470000	in other words, they made money
7470000	7472000	so they will keep trying to make more money
7472000	7474000	best wishes, Capcom
7474000	7476000	AkumaJP says they are still testing the water
7476000	7478000	I mean, honestly guys
7478000	7480000	this is also relevant
7480000	7482000	because I could see a lot more
7482000	7484000	games going down this path
7484000	7486000	if you are able to successfully
7486000	7488000	play games on the cloud and have the minimal
7488000	7490000	you know
7490000	7492000	delay, I mean you
7492000	7494000	would never be able to play a music game in the cloud
7494000	7496000	at least not with today's technology, but who knows 10 years from now
7496000	7498000	but I really feel like when we get to
7498000	7500000	the Playstation 5 and the next box
7500000	7502000	we're gonna see a lot more of like
7502000	7504000	shit that happens in the cloud, like you were talking about
7504000	7506000	it's supposed to happen with Crackdown 3
7506000	7508000	but for whatever reason they dialed that back it sounds like
7508000	7510000	but I really do think
7510000	7512000	that's gonna be a major part of the next round of
7512000	7514000	consoles and how we're gonna get
7514000	7516000	even more mind-blowing graphics that take
7516000	7518000	forever to develop I'm sure
7518000	7520000	so, anyhow
7520000	7522000	moving on, if you
7522000	7524000	and then there's Nintendo Switch
7524000	7526000	talk about
7526000	7528000	the technological pushing the envelope
7528000	7530000	but then again, you know what
7530000	7532000	this is how the Nintendo Switch hangs in there
7532000	7534000	and this whole story was just about
7534000	7536000	putting some of these more technologically demanding games on the Switch
7536000	7538000	but the Switch finally got
7538000	7540000	something that people were wondering, when is this gonna happen
7540000	7542000	so if you were waiting for YouTube
7542000	7544000	on the Nintendo Switch, guess what
7544000	7546000	it finally frickin' happened this week
7546000	7548000	they used all that YouTube money that they siphoned
7548000	7550000	from people putting
7550000	7552000	Nintendo games on YouTube
7552000	7554000	so anyway
7554000	7556000	YouTube is available around the world
7556000	7558000	it's on the UK store, North America store
7558000	7560000	I don't know about Japan, but I don't see why it wouldn't be
7560000	7562000	and of course
7562000	7564000	it's YouTube, and it's pretty much
7564000	7566000	the same interface and everything you're used to
7566000	7568000	on other platforms, but
7568000	7570000	now you can take it, essentially on the go
7570000	7572000	as long as there's internet
7572000	7574000	obviously it's still there, where you can't like download videos to watch later
7574000	7576000	that would be it
7576000	7578000	well, I mean, YouTube Red kinda lets you do that
7578000	7580000	right, but I don't think it does it on the Switch
7580000	7582000	I don't know, I haven't, I mean, who do I know that has
7582000	7584000	YouTube Red? All-Source has that. So many videos on my
7584000	7586000	32 gigabytes of internal storage
7586000	7588000	so
7588000	7590000	anyway, the YouTube app is
7590000	7592000	now out, by the way
7592000	7594000	and besides, you know, it's fine if you can't
7594000	7596000	necessarily download
7596000	7598000	videos to the Switch
7598000	7600000	because, what, you don't have a cell
7600000	7602000	phone or something?
7602000	7604000	Don't y'all have phones? Don't y'all have phones?
7604000	7606000	Anyway
7606000	7608000	that's what Nintendo's saying about voice chat
7608000	7610000	don't y'all have phones? But Nintendo
7610000	7612000	is also, on kind of a related note
7612000	7614000	looking to continue to add features to
7614000	7616000	Switch online
7616000	7618000	a recent investor Q&A, Shontaro Furukawa
7618000	7620000	said
7620000	7622000	we think Nintendo Switch online had a good launch
7622000	7624000	but the service has only just begun
7624000	7626000	so we have no plans to disclose any current subscriber
7626000	7628000	ratios or number of subscribers at this time
7628000	7630000	that's kinda interesting
7630000	7632000	well, that sounds like it's not very high
7632000	7634000	then
7634000	7636000	I don't necessarily know if I would read into that
7636000	7638000	it may be
7638000	7640000	well, yes it would be, because if it was high
7640000	7642000	it may be lower than expectations
7642000	7644000	but I don't think that necessarily means
7644000	7646000	it's a flop
7646000	7648000	well, I don't think it's a flop, but like
7648000	7650000	I can tell you right now, I'm not like
7650000	7652000	woooo, Nintendo games
7652000	7654000	anyway, continuing in the
7654000	7656000	statement, Shontaro Furukawa said
7656000	7658000	as for the kind of service this will
7658000	7660000	develop into in the future, Nintendo Switch
7660000	7662000	Online is essentially a digital service
7662000	7664000	but we are also offering controllers specifically
7664000	7666000	for use with Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo
7666000	7668000	Switch Online, exclusively to subscribers
7668000	7670000	of the service. We see the need to develop
7670000	7672000	the service beyond being merely
7672000	7674000	digital, in ways to play our
7674000	7676000	strengths as a company that operates
7676000	7678000	an integrated hardware and software
7678000	7680000	business, so I'm really surprised
7680000	7682000	that some of these new amiibo weren't
7682000	7684000	tied to this, but
7684000	7686000	so far they're not
7686000	7688000	it would be a hell of a way to get the ami-
7688000	7690000	do you know, so I found
7690000	7692000	out that
7692000	7694000	Dark Souls came out on Nintendo Switch
7694000	7696000	right? Now, Alan
7696000	7698000	loves Dark Souls, like he plays
7698000	7700000	a lot, he just got the fucking
7700000	7702000	achievement for getting all the other achievements in Dark Souls
7702000	7704000	that is not something you do overnight, right?
7704000	7706000	So, he plays a lot of Dark Souls
7706000	7708000	and I was like, do you want me to buy Dark Souls
7708000	7710000	for you on Switch? And kind of knowing he
7710000	7712000	probably would never play it, he was like, nah
7712000	7714000	I don't really want it on Switch cause he's not
7714000	7716000	gonna play it compared to keyboard and mouse, he's like
7716000	7718000	but, I'd really like to get that Solari
7718000	7720000	amiibo. I was like, okay
7720000	7722000	alright, sure, cute little collectible
7722000	7724000	couldn't find it anywhere
7724000	7726000	come to find out that whole thing was a GameStop
7726000	7728000	exclusive, I forgot that Solari amiibo is a GameStop
7728000	7730000	exclusive, he goes into a GameStop
7730000	7732000	to try to find it while we were at the mall anyway
7732000	7734000	hunting Pokemon this weekend and they tell him
7734000	7736000	the guy, the clerk who works there
7736000	7738000	said he had never even seen one in person
7738000	7740000	because I guess they sold out instantly
7740000	7742000	when the pre-orders went up in March
7742000	7744000	and he actually told Alan
7744000	7746000	the best way to get those right now would be
7746000	7748000	on the reseller market
7748000	7750000	and I'm like, fuck resellers
7750000	7752000	period. Oh my god, does Nintendo not
7752000	7754000	understand supply chain?
7754000	7756000	Oh yes, Nintendo doesn't understand supply
7756000	7758000	chain, quotey fingers, I mean
7758000	7760000	cause
7760000	7762000	I am so
7762000	7764000	sick of this, like
7764000	7766000	oh my god, we're just getting into
7766000	7768000	the physical, you know,
7768000	7770000	collectible market, we don't know what the fuck
7770000	7772000	we're doing, ahhh
7772000	7774000	I'm sorry, like, how
7774000	7776000	how often are we gonna use this
7776000	7778000	as an excuse, well we had no idea
7778000	7780000	what the demand would be
7780000	7782000	do you really have no analysts that fucking
7782000	7784000	do projections for you that you
7784000	7786000	didn't figure this shit out? I mean, I'm sorry
7786000	7788000	that's just really, terrible
7788000	7790000	excuse, like, this many years into it
7790000	7792000	where it's like this all the fucking
7792000	7794000	time
7794000	7796000	Anyway, if anyone out there has a lead
7796000	7798000	on how I could get one of these, not through
7798000	7800000	a reseller market cause I'm not paying markup
7800000	7802000	I would super deeply appreciate it
7802000	7804000	but I'm not gonna expect anything, but you can always hit me up
7804000	7806000	on Twitter at MrRobRoberts, but it would make my hubby
7806000	7808000	very happy if we could locate one
7808000	7810000	cause now it's a thing
7810000	7812000	Alright, let's move on, a few more stories
7812000	7814000	before we get to the Skypline, Loki
7814000	7816000	Alright, so
7816000	7818000	apparently there is this leak that's
7818000	7820000	come out where Valve is developing
7820000	7822000	a new VR
7822000	7824000	headset
7824000	7826000	so they've got images of like this prototype
7826000	7828000	Valve headset and there's a Valve
7828000	7830000	like, watermark on this
7830000	7832000	looks like circuit board here
7832000	7834000	they're saying that
7834000	7836000	apparently from the sources
7836000	7838000	that we're talking about, it's like
7838000	7840000	gonna have a 135 degree
7840000	7842000	view with a Vive Pro
7842000	7844000	resolution and
7844000	7846000	it's gonna be combined with, or possibly
7846000	7848000	combined with these Knuckles controllers
7848000	7850000	that they have and they're saying as well as
7850000	7852000	a Half-Life based VR game
7852000	7854000	that's gonna be a prequel
7854000	7856000	rather than a sequel
7856000	7858000	possibly
7858000	7860000	but there are like apparently
7860000	7862000	screenshots
7862000	7864000	here of this and they're saying that something looks like
7864000	7866000	they have a spot almost where a leap sensor
7866000	7868000	could fit
7868000	7870000	interesting though
7870000	7872000	no word on any sort of
7872000	7874000	details on when something like this would be released
7874000	7876000	but it is something that they're working on
7876000	7878000	so I guess I'll have to wait and see
7882000	7884000	you don't have
7884000	7886000	HTC Vive right? I don't, no
7886000	7888000	would you consider picking this up or HTC Vive
7888000	7890000	or any of that? If it was affordable
7890000	7892000	and
7892000	7894000	really that's it, if it's affordable cause
7894000	7896000	like right now that's what's stopping me from
7896000	7898000	purchasing yet another VR headset
7898000	7900000	I just don't play enough VR stuff
7900000	7902000	I do want one for PC because there's a lot
7902000	7904000	more out there on the PC
7904000	7906000	side but
7906000	7908000	I don't know
7908000	7910000	I'm still fine with just the
7910000	7912000	PlayStation VR for now
7912000	7914000	alright well
7914000	7916000	in other news related
7916000	7918000	to our little quip about don't you all have
7918000	7920000	phones which I feel like that line's gonna get said
7920000	7922000	once a week on this show for a very long time
7922000	7924000	but some interesting follow up
7924000	7926000	rumors, heavy heavy rumors about
7926000	7928000	what was to be at Blizzcon
7928000	7930000	of course that story showed up that said
7930000	7932000	that Diablo 4 was
7932000	7934000	a planned announcement and it was
7934000	7936000	yanked at the last minute
7936000	7938000	that was a rumor that Kotaku posted
7938000	7940000	but then they ended up updating it
7940000	7942000	to basically say the article
7942000	7944000	that originally stated that Blizzard recorded
7944000	7946000	a video and that co-founder
7946000	7948000	Alan Adam was going to talk about a new Diablo
7948000	7950000	game. Kotaku
7950000	7952000	is still sticking by that that video
7952000	7954000	was made but Blizzard is officially
7954000	7956000	disputing that it was ever planned for
7956000	7958000	Blizzcon in a statement
7958000	7960000	to Kotaku Blizzard said first off
7960000	7962000	we want to mention that we definitely hear our community
7962000	7964000	we generally don't comment on rumors or
7964000	7966000	speculation but we can say that we didn't pull
7966000	7968000	any announcements from Blizzcon this year or
7968000	7970000	have plans for other announcements we do
7970000	7972000	continue to have different teams working on
7972000	7974000	multiple unannounced Diablo projects
7974000	7976000	and we look forward to announcing when the time
7976000	7978000	is right but Kotaku is doubling
7978000	7980000	down basically saying two people
7980000	7982000	familiar with Blizzard's plans confirmed
7982000	7984000	that the company recorded a video
7984000	7986000	where co-founder Alan Adam said
7986000	7988000	spoke to fans about a new Diablo
7988000	7990000	project so basically
7990000	7992000	what's being disputed is what
7992000	7994000	is it for?
7994000	7996000	Perhaps it's an
7996000	7998000	announcement for the game awards which
7998000	8000000	would seem ridiculous to me to not
8000000	8002000	play that at Blizzcon
8002000	8004000	like if it turns out
8004000	8006000	that they're going to announce it at the game awards
8006000	8008000	and they passed Blizzcon to do that
8008000	8010000	that's whoo oh
8010000	8012000	the Blizzard fans are not
8012000	8014000	going to be happy. Well on top of that too
8014000	8016000	I did see something
8016000	8018000	that was a press event or something
8018000	8020000	like shortly after all the announcements
8020000	8022000	and they were talking about
8022000	8024000	that their development teams
8024000	8026000	that are working on Diablo
8026000	8028000	that a lot of them
8028000	8030000	or even some of their top developers
8030000	8032000	from all the different
8032000	8034000	franchises that they have are working on
8034000	8036000	mobile projects so that
8036000	8038000	pissed people off as well because they're like
8038000	8040000	well wait a second you're taking your top people
8040000	8042000	from all these other things to
8042000	8044000	develop mobile games
8044000	8046000	what the fuck you guys
8046000	8048000	so that's just
8048000	8050000	kind of a little bit more salt
8050000	8052000	in the wounds I guess
8052000	8054000	Well
8054000	8056000	what do you think? Do you think
8056000	8058000	it's possible that they were going
8058000	8060000	to announce it and then they pulled it?
8060000	8062000	I'm like why would you pull that?
8062000	8064000	I guess there's concern about
8064000	8066000	oh it's the game's been
8066000	8068000	going in these different directions and
8068000	8070000	it's kind of you know it's hitting that
8070000	8072000	phase a lot of games do where they're not totally
8072000	8074000	sure like what the final product is going to look like but I'm like
8074000	8076000	you could still just announce
8076000	8078000	you're doing it like it's everything I said in
8078000	8080000	last week's show if they had just followed up
8080000	8082000	that announcement just like
8082000	8084000	Bethesda did with a 30 second trailer
8084000	8086000	that shows the Diablo 4 logo
8086000	8088000	it doesn't even have to be the final logo
8088000	8090000	just one that they could then
8090000	8092000	sell on t-shirts and people would buy it. It's too late
8092000	8094000	though. It's too late now
8094000	8096000	but I mean I just
8096000	8098000	I feel like video game PR people
8098000	8100000	are going to study this fuck up for years
8102000	8104000	They'll remember it
8104000	8106000	for sure
8106000	8108000	Anyway moving on
8108000	8110000	a couple more stories before the
8110000	8112000	Skype line just two more Loki
8112000	8114000	Alright and so apparently
8114000	8116000	there's
8116000	8118000	with you guys may remember
8118000	8120000	Smash Brothers so with
8120000	8122000	Mr. Game and Watch
8122000	8124000	they had some different attacks that were
8124000	8126000	in there one of which unfortunately
8126000	8128000	is mildly racist apparently
8128000	8130000	so it's the attack where
8130000	8132000	he kind of
8132000	8134000	looks like a Native American
8134000	8136000	or whatever and he
8136000	8138000	throws fire so apparently
8138000	8140000	this fire attack which is
8140000	8142000	from well the game fire attack
8142000	8144000	might be a little bit offensive
8144000	8146000	nowadays so they're going to be
8146000	8148000	retooling that and changing
8148000	8150000	it because it doesn't necessarily
8150000	8152000	represent the company's values
8152000	8154000	nowadays
8154000	8156000	so they're going to have to I guess
8156000	8158000	redesign how that's going to look
8158000	8160000	and it will be in effect
8160000	8162000	I guess in the new Smash
8162000	8164000	Brothers game so they say
8164000	8166000	yeah Nintendo's been planning to distribute an
8166000	8168000	update for Smash Brothers Ultimate
8168000	8170000	that removes the feature or the
8170000	8172000	feather from the silhouette of Mr. Game
8172000	8174000	and Watch
8174000	8176000	the original game on
8176000	8178000	which is this depiction of the character's base
8178000	8180000	was released more than three decades ago and doesn't
8180000	8182000	represent our company's values today
8182000	8184000	we apologize if you were offended
8184000	8186000	alright
8186000	8188000	well I suppose that's nice
8188000	8190000	of a company to listen to the feedback and
8190000	8192000	correct their course yeah
8192000	8194000	that's just a minor thing alright
8194000	8196000	before we go to the phones
8196000	8198000	I do want to point out another heavy
8198000	8200000	rumor but I think this is more
8200000	8202000	than rumor because it was discovered in a Steam
8202000	8204000	database that
8204000	8206000	Sunset Overdrive is on its way
8206000	8208000	to the PC this
8208000	8210000	after an ESRB listing was already
8210000	8212000	released now I bet this is the type of thing
8212000	8214000	that could show up at Game Awards because if
8214000	8216000	they didn't announce it at X018
8216000	8218000	which would have been the perfect place to do it
8218000	8220000	well I guess not, not for PC
8220000	8222000	I would think that Game Awards is like a shoe-in
8222000	8224000	they're going to come out in Game Awards and say this is Sunset
8224000	8226000	Overdrive is available today
8226000	8228000	on PC I would bet that's going to be
8228000	8230000	what happens we'll see but anyway
8230000	8232000	a lot of people that did play this game really
8232000	8234000	enjoy it, it kind of went under the radar
8234000	8236000	for a lot of people I think just because the Xbox One
8236000	8238000	didn't end up as highly adopted
8238000	8240000	I'm surprised it's becoming the Steam and not like
8240000	8242000	the Windows Store I guess
8242000	8244000	Microsoft probably just wants to put it everywhere
8244000	8246000	but then again wasn't
8246000	8248000	their other game that was
8248000	8250000	I can't remember what the hell that game was called
8250000	8252000	but like the other
8252000	8254000	Xbox One game that
8254000	8256000	was a Kinect game but not a Kinect game
8256000	8258000	anymore I can't remember
8258000	8260000	what the fuck it was called but
8260000	8262000	Kinect developed it but
8262000	8264000	I don't know I think that
8264000	8266000	well but then Forza is not available on Steam
8266000	8268000	well then the other one too also
8268000	8270000	Dead Rising, didn't Dead Rising
8270000	8272000	end up coming out? I believe it did you're right
8272000	8274000	yeah so
8274000	8276000	but yeah so anyway looks like Sunset Overdrive
8276000	8278000	is going to be happening it's just a matter
8278000	8280000	of when and honestly
8280000	8282000	Microsoft is releasing most things on
8282000	8284000	PC and Xbox anyway
8284000	8286000	Crackdown 3 has got to be a PC game as well right?
8286000	8288000	yeah it's going to be on the Windows Store
8288000	8290000	honestly I might just pick it up on PC well I guess
8290000	8292000	I might as well get the one that's universal right? You buy it
8292000	8294000	digitally you get the universal thing right? I imagine that's still
8294000	8296000	going to be the case just like it was for Forza
8296000	8298000	yeah I think so I'll probably pick that up that's pretty cool
8298000	8300000	so cool Sunset Overdrive
8300000	8302000	probably on its way to PC
8302000	8304000	I wonder how that's going to work though if I already own it on
8304000	8306000	Xbox One thanks to games with gold
8306000	8308000	I would already own it digitally so are they going to
8308000	8310000	give me the PC one for free? They might if they
8310000	8312000	make it a play anywhere type thing
8312000	8314000	that would actually be I would be like so happy
8314000	8316000	I mean I guess Steam wouldn't really be involved
8316000	8318000	in that case but still hey free game
8318000	8320000	so alright

8387000	8389000	you I'm here every week you're here
8389000	8391000	almost every week well
8391000	8393000	I try I try so
8393000	8395000	you know coming out of the end of the con
8395000	8397000	season and so forth you know well we appreciate
8397000	8399000	it so what's on your mind tonight buddy
8399000	8401000	Sunset Orange Drive is
8401000	8403000	is one again that's one of those games
8403000	8405000	how did I miss it
8405000	8407000	I picked it up for 10 bucks and
8407000	8409000	I'm having a fucking blast with
8409000	8411000	that game I think there's a lot of people that really
8411000	8413000	slept on the game and to be honest I haven't played
8413000	8415000	it a lot and it's one of those titles I really need
8415000	8417000	to go back and play more but especially
8417000	8419000	if it does end up being play anywhere on
8419000	8421000	PC I think I probably yeah
8421000	8423000	I'd like super check it out why not
8423000	8425000	I mean they gave that game away
8425000	8427000	so I think a lot of people have it
8427000	8429000	yeah definitely and
8429000	8431000	another thing I
8431000	8433000	quit like the tail end of
8433000	8435000	XO 18 like the summary
8435000	8437000	and I have to say
8437000	8439000	Microsoft kind of got me shook
8439000	8441000	why is that what what what
8441000	8443000	shook you at XO 18
8443000	8445000	the studio purchases or what
8445000	8447000	no Final Fantasy backwards
8447000	8449000	compatibility
8449000	8451000	that I mean I'm excited for
8451000	8453000	people that owned it on Xbox but I
8453000	8455000	had them on PlayStation so unfortunately
8455000	8457000	it does me no good and I just
8457000	8459000	I don't see myself buying those
8459000	8461000	games on Xbox one when
8461000	8463000	I already did buy Final Fantasy 13
8463000	8465000	on PC and
8465000	8467000	you might remember it was a little bit bumpy when it first
8467000	8469000	came out on PC it had like some
8469000	8471000	graphic things holding it back but they they tweaked
8471000	8473000	it and they release you know they they like updated
8473000	8475000	it via patch and it's it's pretty
8475000	8477000	solid like the PC release is pretty good
8477000	8479000	so I feel like if
8479000	8481000	they up rezzed or
8481000	8483000	did anything special to Final Fantasy
8483000	8485000	they probably just kind of ported the PC version
8485000	8487000	to Xbox one which is not a bad
8487000	8489000	thing it's it's great it looked great on
8489000	8491000	PC I don't know I think they went
8491000	8493000	back and worked on the 360 version
8493000	8495000	and made it a little bit better I mean
8495000	8497000	yes I have all three
8497000	8499000	games for PlayStation 3 but
8499000	8501000	I think about
8501000	8503000	almost a year ago I had my
8503000	8505000	system reflowed
8505000	8507000	and now when I turn on my PS3
8507000	8509000	it sounds like a jet engine
8509000	8511000	and I'm looking at the prices of
8511000	8513000	FF 13 on
8513000	8515000	360 and it's like I could pick up all
8515000	8517000	three games for 25 bucks
8517000	8519000	which is like probably cheaper
8519000	8521000	than what it's going to be you know
8521000	8523000	in the in the Microsoft store you know
8523000	8525000	for Xbox one that's
8525000	8527000	that's not bad yeah I
8527000	8529000	I do think there was a missed opportunity here to
8529000	8531000	like repackage and release a trilogy
8531000	8533000	but that's
8533000	8535000	you see you got that on the second hand market
8535000	8537000	for 25 bucks yeah on
8537000	8539000	Amazon that's
8539000	8541000	really not a bad idea that may that
8541000	8543000	may be a way to do it like to pick up the games
8543000	8545000	on the second hand market and then play them that way
8545000	8547000	is actually like a really smart idea kudos
8547000	8549000	on that that's what I've been doing a lot
8549000	8551000	of the games and I notice you know
8551000	8553000	yes GameStop may have
8553000	8555000	it for 19 bucks used
8555000	8557000	but I can just go right over to Amazon
8557000	8559000	pick it up for the same price brand spanking new
8559000	8561000	in the case everything so
8561000	8563000	yeah and now that you got
8563000	8565000	the other Final Fantasy games coming
8565000	8567000	over I'm just kind of hyped about
8567000	8569000	it and you know I get
8569000	8571000	it that the Final Fantasy
8571000	8573000	games are supposed to be like defunct
8573000	8575000	to Playstation I get that
8575000	8577000	right but it's like I said
8577000	8579000	the only reason why I
8579000	8581000	picked up a 360
8581000	8583000	I mean Xbox one is for the
8583000	8585000	backwards compatibility and
8585000	8587000	half of my 360 games play
8587000	8589000	on the one hell when I thought
8589000	8591000	about Crackdown I popped that in last night
8591000	8593000	and I'm up for like two hours playing through that
8593000	8595000	game I'm just like this looks
8595000	8597000	amazing well and now
8597000	8599000	even if you didn't have Crackdown we just
8599000	8601000	mentioned earlier they're giving it away
8601000	8603000	so you can get Crackdown so
8603000	8605000	there's no reason not to check
8605000	8607000	it out which of course is all just promo
8607000	8609000	for Crackdown
8609000	8611000	3 which is very similar
8611000	8613000	to and again a reminder this is kind
8613000	8615000	of your last chance cause it's only gonna be up for
8615000	8617000	another week but Destiny 2
8617000	8619000	is free on PC
8619000	8621000	if you have the battle net launcher which if
8621000	8623000	you've ever played Hearthstone or
8623000	8625000	some of the free games that
8625000	8627000	Blizzard has then you have the
8627000	8629000	battle net launcher you can get free Destiny 2
8629000	8631000	but we all know it's because
8631000	8633000	they have an expansion they're trying to sell so
8633000	8635000	that's the thing you're gonna have to buy
8635000	8637000	but hey it's still a free game
8637000	8639000	I mean yeah I dumped on that too so
8639000	8641000	yeah
8641000	8643000	so well free stuff is good
8643000	8645000	and backwards compatibility
8645000	8647000	is great and I really
8647000	8649000	wish it was a message that Sony would hear
8649000	8651000	but for whatever reason they're not
8651000	8653000	I mean
8653000	8655000	look we had backwards compatibility
8655000	8657000	for the Playstation 2 to the 1
8657000	8659000	we had a PS3 for 1
8659000	8661000	and 2 until they ripped
8661000	8663000	that out and put it in the slip
8663000	8665000	now they can't
8665000	8667000	say it cannot be done
8667000	8669000	because the
8669000	8671000	Xbox One and
8671000	8673000	the Playstation 4 are the
8673000	8675000	same identical
8675000	8677000	hardware
8677000	8679000	the speeds of the processors are slightly different
8679000	8681000	the software that runs it is different
8681000	8683000	but it can't be done
8683000	8685000	I mean if Microsoft can do it
8685000	8687000	it's no excuse
8687000	8689000	Sony can't, Microsoft's like oh we got this
8689000	8691000	it's backwards compatible we have it in the store
8691000	8693000	for $19.99 wait you have
8693000	8695000	the game pop it in yours now
8695000	8697000	for free we already know if
8697000	8699000	nothing else that machine is perfectly capable
8699000	8701000	of doing PS1 and PS2 games
8701000	8703000	if nothing else we know
8703000	8705000	the Playstation 4 can do that so
8705000	8707000	it's just weird to me that they don't
8707000	8709000	open it up so and I see in chat
8709000	8711000	Kaijuto says I don't ever want Sony
8711000	8713000	to go back well I'm not like
8713000	8715000	I honestly feel at this
8715000	8717000	point it's like a switch it's a button
8717000	8719000	that Sony won't push
8719000	8721000	you know and if you don't want to play retro
8721000	8723000	stuff fine don't again it's your money
8723000	8725000	spend it on what you want but for those of us
8725000	8727000	that would love to play Magic Penjel again
8727000	8729000	on Playstation 4
8729000	8731000	let us do it
8731000	8733000	I mean I understand there are
8733000	8735000	some people out there that are console
8735000	8737000	collectors they have the space for it
8737000	8739000	if you saw my entertainment center
8739000	8741000	I'm running out of space
8741000	8743000	I'm picking up the PS4 on Black Friday
8743000	8745000	and I'm looking
8745000	8747000	well there I'm going to take the PS2 out
8747000	8749000	and put the PS4 there
8749000	8751000	like you said I'd be happy with the PS1
8751000	8753000	emulation on the PS4
8753000	8755000	I can retire my PS3 fat
8755000	8757000	that sounds like a NASA jet rocket
8757000	8759000	and put a slim in there and call
8759000	8761000	it a day
8761000	8763000	well we'll see if
8763000	8765000	this gamble pays off for Sony
8765000	8767000	by the time the Playstation 5 rolls around
8767000	8769000	because I bet you I just
8769000	8771000	it's so interesting because
8771000	8773000	I just remember when it was
8773000	8775000	Playstation 3 versus Xbox 360
8775000	8777000	and Microsoft clobbered
8777000	8779000	Sony out the gate anyway
8779000	8781000	and Sony spent a long time catching up
8781000	8783000	and the tables got reversed
8783000	8785000	this last time and Sony clobbered
8785000	8787000	Microsoft out the gate
8787000	8789000	you know Microsoft is catching up to an extent
8789000	8791000	but Sony's got the lead
8791000	8793000	I'm almost wondering if
8793000	8795000	it's going to flip again
8795000	8797000	and coming out with the next series
8797000	8799000	because Microsoft's got all these studios
8799000	8801000	and will likely open itself up
8801000	8803000	to backwards compatibility and pretty much has already
8803000	8805000	said that no matter what they do
8805000	8807000	with the Xbox in the future it's still going to play
8807000	8809000	the older games or whatever
8809000	8811000	so it would be interesting to see if Sony's going to
8811000	8813000	follow suit or if they're going to stay stubborn like this
8813000	8815000	and if that decision comes back
8815000	8817000	to bite them
8817000	8819000	you know you said it back
8819000	8821000	a few episodes back
8821000	8823000	as long as Sony's on top
8823000	8825000	they're not going to care
8825000	8827000	when Microsoft was on top they're not going to care
8827000	8829000	and then the role was reversed
8829000	8831000	so why hasn't either company learned yet
8831000	8833000	that maybe you should care when you're on top
8833000	8835000	because you're not going to be on top forever
8835000	8837000	well I think Microsoft is starting to learn
8837000	8839000	like when they had their
8839000	8841000	Windows phones
8841000	8843000	their Windows phones are great
8843000	8845000	on a business level
8845000	8847000	but not on a personal
8847000	8849000	the hardware is there
8849000	8851000	the apps are not
8851000	8853000	the fact that Square Enix
8853000	8855000	says the Final Fantasy games are coming to Xbox One
8855000	8857000	that means
8857000	8859000	Microsoft is starting to realize
8859000	8861000	you need to not just
8861000	8863000	throw money to buy studios
8863000	8865000	you need to throw money at the third party to be like
8865000	8867000	here's X amount of money
8867000	8869000	we want these titles on our system
8869000	8871000	I mean that's basically what Sony is doing
8871000	8873000	I mean look at the gaming
8873000	8875000	tournaments for fighting games
8875000	8877000	mostly everyone's playing on PS4
8877000	8879000	for the fighting games
8879000	8881000	next year is going to be a hell of a year
8881000	8883000	because I anticipate
8883000	8885000	Microsoft is going to be first out the gate
8885000	8887000	next year so it's going to be very
8887000	8889000	interesting to see what happens
8889000	8891000	alright my friend I'm going to let you go
8891000	8893000	to try and squeeze in some more calls but thank you as always
8893000	8895000	for the call
8895000	8897000	take care buddy
8897000	8899000	OrangeLawnTradio all went over it on Skype
8899000	8901000	and I had cut off a last minute story you wanted
8901000	8903000	to do Loki while we wait for calls
8903000	8905000	there's this game called Scum which apparently
8905000	8907000	had a patch issued
8907000	8909000	for it that fixed
8909000	8911000	a bunch of bugs in the games
8911000	8913000	all related to penis size
8913000	8915000	because I like this game like Conan
8915000	8917000	or Age of Conan I believe
8917000	8919000	you create your character and the penis
8919000	8921000	size and there's an issue where
8921000	8923000	the penis size would get bigger
8923000	8925000	each time you logged in
8925000	8927000	and there's also one that says
8927000	8929000	it's possible to increase penis size without it
8929000	8931000	affecting other attributes and
8931000	8933000	urinating would lock hands if the penis
8933000	8935000	and penis if
8935000	8937000	interrupted
8937000	8939000	penises are very complicated
8939000	8941000	things apparently
8941000	8943000	in video games
8943000	8945000	alrighty
8945000	8947000	then
8947000	8949000	DarkTit Studio in chat says
8949000	8951000	this isn't a SoulCalibur 6 situation is it
8951000	8953000	also wow speaking of SoulCalibur 6
8953000	8955000	oh no I think we did touch on it last week
8955000	8957000	the Nier character coming to SoulCalibur 6 I guess that wasn't
8957000	8959000	rapid fire last week I think
8959000	8961000	I think we mentioned it yeah
8961000	8963000	I need to still pick up SoulCalibur 6
8963000	8965000	I still have not picked that up
8965000	8967000	and I really want to play it but
8967000	8969000	it's that time of year where everything's coming out
8969000	8971000	now we got Let's Go and
8971000	8973000	all this other stuff
8973000	8975000	one more call for calls Orange Lounge Radio all one word
8975000	8977000	on Skype
8977000	8979000	and by the way I just want you guys to know
8979000	8981000	that I'm extremely
8981000	8983000	happy because it sounds like somebody's coming through
8983000	8985000	on the Amiibo that I need
8985000	8987000	so I'm like super jazzed about that
8987000	8989000	you don't even know so
8989000	8991000	you guys are awesome this is what motivates me to keep
8991000	8993000	coming back every week to do this show
8993000	8995000	for serious how awesome you guys are
8995000	8997000	um
8997000	8999000	did you do
8999000	9001000	no other stories no
9001000	9003000	I did see someone talking about
9003000	9005000	since you know obviously we have
9005000	9007000	a very good version of Tetris
9007000	9009000	on the Playstation 4
9009000	9011000	that there was a not so
9011000	9013000	good version of Tetris Ubisoft
9013000	9015000	made about a year ago
9015000	9017000	on the Playstation 4 I think
9017000	9019000	I think I actually own that one too
9019000	9021000	I think you do own it
9021000	9023000	I don't remember what the
9023000	9025000	I feel like it had frame rate issues or something
9025000	9027000	like really basic that shouldn't have been there so
9027000	9029000	uh it's always interesting to see
9029000	9031000	like who gets the Tetris license and what they do with it
9031000	9033000	because I feel like the Tetris company really
9033000	9035000	licenses that out to like multiple people
9035000	9037000	at once like pretty much whoever wants
9037000	9039000	to do it so but I'm
9039000	9041000	they might as well just delist
9041000	9043000	the whatever Ubisoft made last year well
9043000	9045000	I shouldn't be such an ass
9045000	9047000	because it had the
9047000	9049000	multiplayer stuff a little more embedded in it
9049000	9051000	and Tetris Effect doesn't have multiplayer
9051000	9053000	but you know it does have multiplayer
9053000	9055000	Puyo Puyo vs Tetris has a decent
9055000	9057000	multiplayer in it and it has Puyo Puyo
9057000	9059000	so you know
9059000	9061000	I still think they'll inevitably
9061000	9063000	do a Tetris Effect 2 I mean I really
9063000	9065000	hope they do I
9065000	9067000	just as long as
9067000	9069000	Tetsuya Mizuguchi gets to keep making games
9069000	9071000	I think they just do DLC
9071000	9073000	maybe
9073000	9075000	I mean I would love to see them just do more skins
9075000	9077000	and songs maybe some commercial
9077000	9079000	stuff as DLC
9079000	9081000	yeah well remember
9081000	9083000	when Luminous on 360 I know I brought this up before
9083000	9085000	remember when we went to that E3 and they were
9085000	9087000	showing Luminous on 360 with like
9087000	9089000	MTV type songs as skins
9089000	9091000	and I've I this never
9091000	9093000	came out but I played Madonna's
9093000	9095000	Sorry that song in that music
9095000	9097000	video was a Luminous skin that they never
9097000	9099000	released for whatever reason I don't know if the licensing
9099000	9101000	fell through or what but that was something I played
9101000	9103000	at E3 and I was super excited about it I remember
9103000	9105000	not being able to really hear it on the show floor
9105000	9107000	but it had the video of Madonna dancing
9107000	9109000	and the only stuff
9109000	9111000	we ever really got was all like the in-house
9111000	9113000	like Genki Rockets and all that stuff
9113000	9115000	they never did like
9115000	9117000	actual songs
9117000	9119000	probably thought they couldn't get the return on investment
9119000	9121000	maybe I don't know but Luminous 2
9121000	9123000	on PSP which people
9123000	9125000	don't talk about as much as the original
9125000	9127000	Luminous 2 had a lot of commercial
9127000	9129000	stuff in it it had like Hollaback Girl
9129000	9131000	it had a Missy Elliott song it had Beck
9131000	9133000	it had like a lot of commercial stuff in it
9133000	9135000	I still don't remember that now
9135000	9137000	I don't know why people didn't like that version
9137000	9139000	of the game as much I thought it was great
9139000	9141000	but anyway
9141000	9143000	alright well sadly that's
9143000	9145000	looks like the well is pretty dry on phone
9145000	9147000	calls but that's okay you guys did great on
9147000	9149000	emails tonight if you do think of anything
9149000	9151000	you would like to email us about
9151000	9153000	you can send us an email participate at
9153000	9155000	orangeloungeradio.com if you don't send us

9181000	9183000	so please a nice 5 star
9183000	9185000	review on a place like iTunes or
9185000	9187000	Google Play podcast or wherever it is you
9187000	9189000	heard about this those go
9189000	9191000	a long way as well I am aware
9191000	9193000	that you can get more podcasts on Spotify
9193000	9195000	that is a direction I will go with
9195000	9197000	OLR soon but behind the scenes
9197000	9199000	we're going to be moving our hosting around
9199000	9201000	the same time that we move to Twitch
9201000	9203000	so for that reason I've held off on Spotify
9203000	9205000	submission but I know that's something on people's radar
9205000	9207000	and I will get us there
9207000	9209000	soon so but
9209000	9211000	otherwise we're in a lot of podcasting places
9211000	9213000	as it is
9213000	9215000	I think that's all I have to say
9215000	9217000	so I think we can go around and get final thoughts
9217000	9219000	Loki your final thought tonight
9219000	9221000	my final thought is I have
9221000	9223000	a hell of a migraine and I'm not sure if it's
9223000	9225000	because I spent the whole day with the kids or because
9225000	9227000	of the smoke or a little bit of both
9227000	9229000	a little bit of column A a little bit of column B
9229000	9231000	for sure for sure and I guess on
9231000	9233000	that note my final thought is
9233000	9235000	I just I
9235000	9237000	hope people are okay after the
9237000	9239000	fires I hope they're able to build stuff back
9239000	9241000	it's just it's so horrible
9241000	9243000	reading about all that and knowing that I've been to a
9243000	9245000	town that doesn't exist anymore it's really weird
9245000	9247000	but my thoughts are with everybody
9247000	9249000	affected by that and for those near
9249000	9251000	the smoke stay indoors play
9251000	9253000	some video games that's probably the
9253000	9255000	best thing to do right now have a great night
9255000	9257000	everybody we'll see you next time in two weeks
