Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Present Period, Petey Piranha picked a pot to push. Petey Piranha pushes paladins anything but peacefully. Petey Piranha pushes in participation and prepares for pressure to pile paladins into a pit. Phew. Please present your presents on the presentation where every player plays a part.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:49.000
Slow clap for Jason, that was amazing. Hi, it's Rob and welcome to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio here live with episode number 751 for this November the 4th of 2018. I of course am Rob Roberts, he is Techmaster Loki.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
Hello. Hi Loki, how are you doing? I'm fine. Good, good. Good to have you back of course for another week.

00:54.000 --> 01:04.000
Not here for another week, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Well, she will be joining us later thanks to Radio Magic, but sadly as you know her work schedule has her occupied otherwise for a little bit longer.

01:04.000 --> 01:14.000
So we hope to welcome her back full time real soon. I know she'll pop in for a show later in the month in studio kind of like she was last week for our big 750th episode.

01:15.000 --> 01:30.000
But now we're at 751, so only what 249 after tonight, then we hit 1000, then we're done, right? No podcast hits 1000 weekly episodes, right? Nobody's that crazy. I'm that crazy. Yes, you are that crazy.

01:30.000 --> 01:39.000
Hello to all you crazy people who listen along with us, and I say that in the best possible way. Of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

01:40.000 --> 01:52.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Again, that's vognetwork.com where we have chatters like VidPower who ask, how many takes did it take to do that intro right?

01:52.000 --> 02:03.000
I don't know. I didn't ask Jason. I do know that was his second script. He said he changed it. He said grab this new one, not the first one I used. So I bet I didn't catch all the differences.

02:03.000 --> 02:12.000
Are you saying he flipped the script? He did. He flipped the script, but he can do that. It's this little creative thing we let him do because Jason does great jobs with the intro, as you heard tonight.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
Brad from Pod Culture, of course, wants to know the question of the week. What did Loki bring to eat? You went to the fried chicken place again, right?

02:19.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah, I went to the fried chicken place. I got their chicken strips, which probably shouldn't have gotten those because those are just, they look like they're the ones that you find anywhere.

02:27.000 --> 02:40.000
That they probably were frozen and they just threw them in a deep fryer. And they don't really have any dipping sauces aside from this generic ranch to go along with it. So it's just kind of bland.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
But garlic fries.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
But garlic fries are great. And the waffle is great.

02:45.000 --> 02:54.000
We got a lot of gaming news to cover tonight, so let's just jump right in. We had a lot going on in gaming this week thanks to BlizzCon, which is always a huge convention.

02:54.000 --> 03:07.000
Blizzard is a very large gaming company that makes games that have really changed the industry, like World of Warcraft, Diablo. Certainly a lot of people really love that series.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Rock and roll racing.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
Absolutely, The Lost Vikings, Starcraft and what that did for competitive gaming, especially we know in Korea and stuff, Starcraft is a huge deal.

03:16.000 --> 03:24.000
And of course Overwatch is really changing the game now in this day and age. Overwatch is really taking esports to another level thanks to the Overwatch League.

03:24.000 --> 03:32.000
But lots of interesting stuff out of BlizzCon, right? This year's BlizzCon, not without controversy, which I'm sure you're all waiting for us to get into.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
But let's make sure we talk about everything. So what did we get at BlizzCon this year, Loki?

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Well we got announcements, announcements, and more announcements.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Well that's what they do at BlizzCon. You pay $200 to go hear announcements.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
Yes. So new expansion for World of Warcraft?

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
Sorta. I know you don't play well. It's a patch expansion.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
Whatever. Patch expansion. You get it for free.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Ok, so we're gonna talk a lot tonight about language in marketing.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Cause you all know what this is gonna come down to.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
But this is one reason why. So Blizzard tricked you just the way they want to trick you.

04:11.000 --> 04:20.000
You thought it was a new expansion, but it's not. It's just a new patch that they give a fancy name to that's part of the Battle for Azeroth expansion.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
But it makes it sound like, oh it's this whole new thing.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
And it does bring new stuff to the game. Certainly if you're a World of Warcraft fan, you are very much looking forward to it.

04:28.000 --> 04:35.000
I'm sure WoW based shows like Girls Gone WoW here on this very network will spend much time talking about this new patch.

04:35.000 --> 04:44.000
But it is not what we would usually consider a new expansion, meaning retail release, box, $60 price tag, that whole type of thing.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
It's just the newest patch. And considering the Battle for Azeroth is very story heavy.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
A lot of people kind of want to know where the story is gonna go. And who the new allied races are gonna be and all that stuff.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
Anyway, I won't bore you with all those details. Cause I know we have a lot of people that don't play WoW here on this show.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
But it's more stuff for the WoW fan base.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah. They also announced the Warcraft 3 remaster that's gonna be coming out.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
That has a lot of people excited. I don't think I've heard a negative thing about that.

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
That looks pretty awesome. 4K. And they even have another version of it that has some of the DLCs.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
Or the expansion packs that they had from Warcraft 3.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah, they kind of get into some of the story that you play out in World of Warcraft.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Kind of like how the Lich King came to be and all that. That was the Frozen Throne expansion in Warcraft 3.

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
As much as I know about Warcraft lore now, thanks to my time with World of Warcraft, I actually didn't play a lot of Warcraft 3 back in the day.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
I don't even think I ever owned it. I think I had a person I used to date that owned it and I kind of played it that way.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
But never really bought it myself. So I'm kind of interested in checking it out.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
And you know a lot of stuff was born of Warcraft 3's mods.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
Such as the modern lane based MOBA is born from Warcraft 3.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
That's where Defense of the Ancients was the mod. Or Dota.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
You ever wondered why Valve has Dota 2 and where the hell is Dota 1?

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
That's because Dota 1 was a mod for Warcraft 3.

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
Just like when Valve released Team Fortress 2, that's because the original Team Fortress was a Quake mod.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
So Valve, at least for a while, they've been kind of quiet for a few years, but at least for a while was notorious for hiring the modding community to make new games.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Such as those examples.

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
So anyway, hopefully the mod support will be back in Warcraft 3 because that would be pretty exciting to play the original Defense of the Ancients and all that again.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
It might be exciting. I don't think they talked a lot about that.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
No. New character announced for Overwatch, Ashe.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Female McCree, kind of. But with a shotgun.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Basically McCree's antithesis, but female.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
Voiced by Jennifer Hale, which is great because Jennifer Hale is a big name in the voice acting side of business.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
She's done a lot of the BioWare, FemShep.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Our own Bobby Blackwolf is very proud of the bumper he has featuring Jennifer Hale.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
I met her once at one of the many gamer exes, one of the ones she was at, and she's great.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
A lot of people know who she is and it's kind of one of those, well it's about time they found a way to put her in Overwatch.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
So win-win all around. I don't think anybody's upset about Ashe at all.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
She has a shotgun, which I didn't realize really is.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
I guess because I always kind of assumed that Roadhog's weapon was kind of like a shotgun, but it's really not.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
It's more like a chaingun.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
So yeah, I mean, makes a lot of sense.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
We needed a shotgun hero in Overwatch, so now you got Ashe.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Doesn't Junkrat have...

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
No, because Junkrat uses all those grenades. His big thing is the grenade launcher.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
I've literally played maybe an hour's worth of Overwatch.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
It's fun, but...

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I have it. I own the game.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Well then you're going to get Ashe because they don't charge for the character, so you'll get Ashe for free.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Alright.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
Vidpower in chat says, thank you Overwatch team for the new female character.

08:00.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah, Blizzard got red to filth for some of their stereotypes and the way they presented characters several years ago.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Not enough jetpack, Kat.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
And Overwatch has been a big change, and I think Blizzard has been applauded for that.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
And yeah, I think some girl power's a great thing.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
I did not pay attention if there was any updates to Heroes of the Storm. I assume that there was.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
There was. They announced, actually the kind of big deal with Heroes of the Storm is that they have a brand new hero, Ophelia?

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Ophelia? I'm butchering her name, but it's something like that.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
But the twist is, she is not from a Blizzard game.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
So, you know, Heroes of the Storm has always been about characters all from other Blizzard games.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
Including tracers in there from Overwatch and Lucio and some of the big names from Overwatch are in there.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
Then you have the monk from Diablo 3, the crusader, but they give him names.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
The crusader is Johanna, they give him names.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
So basically all of Blizzard's franchises, that's where all the characters come from.

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
And probably the deepest cut they did was when they put the lost Vikings in the game.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Because they had to make a new category for Blizzard Classic.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Well now you've got basically a character born from the Nexus.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
So Blizzard has said, essentially we're going to start creating new characters.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
So that's what they did with Ophelia. Sorry, I'm butchering her name.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
But she's kind of like a dark mage, but she carries a big shield.

09:27.000 --> 09:35.000
Interesting though because Blizzard still could have tapped from many different Overwatch characters if they wanted to.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
I believe they're still missing some of the Diablo and Diablo 2 class representation.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
I'm sure they could have put some of the new WoW characters like Princess Taraji.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Some of the characters they're introducing in Battle for Azeroth.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
If they really wanted to, they could put some of the new.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
But for whatever reason, this is the direction they want to go in.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
But I mean, I've played a lot of Heroes of the Storm. I don't hate it.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
It's interesting. Okay, sure. Let me do some new stuff.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
And I don't know anything about Hearthstone either.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Honestly, I hope the Hearthstone fans don't get mad.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
But it's basically par for the course that you get a new card expansion.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
It's a new expansion, new cards.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
The cards do some different things.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Overkill is a brand new thing that's going to be on the cards.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Which means you get a special effect if you overkill.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
Meaning you use more points of damage than it would normally take to kill the character.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
If you overkill, you'll kind of set off an extra mod.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Little things like that.

10:24.000 --> 10:31.000
The expansion, if I remember right, is based on the Loa lore from Battle for Azeroth.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Which is explored with the trolls on the Horde side.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
It's kind of like the gods they believe in.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I'll kind of leave it at that. I don't want to bore you with all the details.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
But that's where Hearthstone is going with that.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And then, and then...

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Wait, wait. Before you get to the big one. Wow Classic, right?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
So they gave a date for World of Warcraft Classic.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
It's going to be summer of 2019.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
No, I had another big one.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Oh, okay. No, I know why I said before you get to the big one.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Well, no. There's another big one.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Oh, okay, okay.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
They're invading your breakfast.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Oh, that is a big one.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah, they dropped that on the pre-show stream.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I was surprised about that. Tell us more.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah, so they're going to have, I don't remember what the cereal is called.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
But it's basically Overwatch cereal.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
And it's Lucio's.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Lucio's, yes.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Which they have referenced in the game before.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
And I actually have a Lucio's shirt.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
So, how funny.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Here I am thinking I was buying a shirt that's like an inside joke to Overwatch.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Because, you know, it's like a joke in the game.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
And now, oh, I spent money on something that is now free advertising for Kellogg's.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
That's great.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
But no, I love that it's a real thing. It's funny.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Yeah, speaking of Kellogg's, I actually was able to pick up a box of Super Mario cereal today.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Oh, that still exists? You can actually get that?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah, they have it over at WinCo now.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Oh, okay. Oh, shit.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
I saw it because I've been looking for that and the kids saw that and I'm like,

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
sure, you can have this Lucky Charms knockoff. There you go.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
That's the one with the cereal box amiibo, right?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
They don't have that anymore.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
It's just cereal now.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
No wonder you can just overprice cereal now.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah, well, you know the Lucio's is supposed to come with a loot box of some sort.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
I don't know if it's a full loot box or a special loot box, but that cereal is going to be impossible to find.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So good luck.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
It's going to be like that Super Mario cereal.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And I bet you, not that I would encourage this.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
I don't encourage this, but I think it's going to happen anyway.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
People are going to buy that Lucio cereal and flip it on eBay and flip it, you know, to get,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
especially if the loot box has something unique in it, which I don't think it will.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I don't think they were saying anything about that.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
I think it's just like a regular, you know, loot box that you get from like leveling up and stuff.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
But yeah, I can really see people trying to flip that cereal, which is kind of interesting.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Ridiculous.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
But I love that Lucio's are a real thing.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
And then, okay, so I guess we'll get into the announcements.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Yes, please.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
So the new Diablo announcements.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
So the Diablo 3 switch that came out finally.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
It was the same day as the start of BlizzCon.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
So, I mean, that was kind of like their big, like, hey, if you want to check out Diablo 3 on Switch, you can starting today.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
And then now it's Diablo, the next Diablo.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And everyone's like, whoa, what is that? What is that?

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
And they're like, you know, in the same vein of Command and Conquer, we're going mobile.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
It's Diablo immortal, folks.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
What's that look for?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Don't you guys have phones?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Come on.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
Don't you use your cell phones and you're talking and you're Twittering and you're Facebooking and Instagram.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
You assholes are all on social media right now tweeting about how much you hate me on your phone.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
A phone you can use to play Diablo Immortal.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
I actually, I got to say, I kind of felt bad for that guy.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
Like, he kind of looked like he had a little bit of stage fright going on.

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
Like there was some weird stuff was happening with the BlizzCon opening, like, because like the sound on the Hearthstone stage didn't work.

13:52.000 --> 14:00.000
So they were clearly having to like shuffle it on the fly because they did the Warcraft 3 thing and then they went back to Hearthstone.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
So they kind of had to like do it out of order a little bit.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
So I think everybody was like a little thrown off from that.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
But like, he just looked very like there was parts of it that was like deer in headlights.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
And like, I'm not, I'm not here to personally make fun of somebody whose job it is to probably make games.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
And, you know, the fact that he has to, you know, get up on the stage is, you know, not everybody can do it.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
And for the most part, he did a good job.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
But I think we all have seen the part where he kind of put his foot in his mouth a little bit when he was like,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
well, don't y'all have phones when?

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
Yes, but that doesn't mean we're all here at BlizzCon because we're fans of mobile games.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
So, yeah.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Anything else you want to say on this, Loki?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Because I get a book.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Yeah, everybody, I got it like a 15 minute rant on this.

14:43.000 --> 14:50.000
I hear, based on what's been seen of it so far, the company it's making, because it isn't actually Blizzard that's developing the game.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
It's another company, I think.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
And the company that, they have a game that's basically a knockoff of Diablo.

14:56.000 --> 15:03.000
And it's like, they're saying that this looks like a knockoff of Diablo, except it's an official Diablo game.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
But it resembles a knockoff of Diablo.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
So take that as you will.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Alright, so let's talk about this whole debacle.

15:13.000 --> 15:20.000
Because we've seen, just the internet has just exploded with a lot of negativity around this game.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
And, you know, actually it wasn't just on the internet, some of it was happening in person.

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
Somebody had the balls to get up there in front of everybody and ask the question,

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
is this an April Fool's joke?

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
You know, completely stone faced, you know, to the developer's face to ask that type of question.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
This is just some type of April Fool's joke.

15:40.000 --> 15:48.000
And like, okay, I understand that you feel very like, you know, wronged or whatever by what happened.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
But like, I couldn't help but feel like, dude, you paid $200 to be at BlizzCon.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
And I just had that DJ Khalid in my mind.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
Khalid, I had him in my mind where that, congrats, you played yourself.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
Like that's honestly like the image that came to my mind is like, you paid $200 to Blizzard

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
so you could go there and just like ask something kind of like,

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
why are you even at the panel if you're not like feeling the game?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Did you just go to be rude?

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
Like it's so, I don't know, like it just, that left a bad taste in my mouth.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
But to be fair, the response wasn't exactly great either.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
What if the response had been something more like this?

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
Ask me the question, Logan. Pretend you are angry, you are angry dude over free mobile game.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Ask me the question, I'm going to pretend I'm developer from Diablo.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Is this like an April Fool's joke or something like that?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I mean, where's the real game?

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
No, no, it's not a joke.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
Look, here's the thing is that as we announced online a couple weeks ago,

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
we have multiple Diablo projects in development right now.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
And we know our PC fans are not going to be disappointed.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
But what we're trying to do right now is we're trying to grow our market

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
into other places where mobile phone gaming is really big.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
I mean, after all, everybody does have a mobile phone,

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
so we want you to be able to take this Diablo experience on the go.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
And we think this is something that can hold you over until the next big Diablo experience.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Wow, that is a great response and not at all, you know, entitled.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
So would that response have been better, Logan?

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
That would have been better than what they did.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Exactly.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
But then again, much like we've learned with Office Space,

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
sometimes the developers aren't the best people to be talking directly to the public.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
Right, and the difference between me and him, to his credit,

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
I have 15 plus years of making shit up on the spot and having dialogue

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
thanks to this little program called Orange Lounge Radio.

17:44.000 --> 17:51.000
This person probably had media training, which probably doesn't cover quite all the bases.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
So while we're talking about messaging and while we're roleplaying

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
this Rob Roberts runs Blizzard scenario here, how about this, Loki?

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
How do you think maybe the message would have been different if,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
and I ask everybody in chat this as well.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
Actually, I want to see if there's any comments there in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
ActDev says, Rob for Blizzard PR.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
My worries, and this is also a worry that people have with the fact that it's a mobile game,

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
is that they're thinking that Activision is running this ship basically.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
And Activision, when it comes to free-to-play models,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
or even not free-to-play models, but treating them as free-to-play models,

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
they milk the fucking shit out of that.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
All of the things that you hate about mobile games will be in this mobile game,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
is what their fear is.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
And looking at EA, same thing.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
EA did the same shit with Command & Conquer, and they thought,

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
what, why are you guys angry? We gave you a new Command & Conquer, what the hell?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Right.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
You know, it's just tone deaf, I guess.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
Well, and let's, if we're going to run with this whole,

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Rob is going to run Blizzard PR for a minute,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
how would you guys feel if BlizzardCon had gone like this?

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
Instead of Diablo Immortal being the last announcement,

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Warcraft III Remastered is the last announcement.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I haven't heard anything negative about the Warcraft III Remastered thing.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Have you heard anything negative about Warcraft III Remastered?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Nope.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
So you can get away with remastering a game that's a classic game

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
that most people really like, and doing that in 4K and modernizing it,

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
and I think people are going to be okay with that.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
So, first things first, we're going to make Warcraft III Remastered

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
the last announcement.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
So before that, we'll get into Diablo.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And so I'm going to be the dude that comes up on stage,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
and I'm going to start it off something like this.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
Hey everybody, and welcome, hope you're having a wonderful BlizzCon,

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
and we have a lot of exciting stuff going on in the Diablo universe.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
You know, we wrote an open letter to all of you a few weeks ago

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
that talked about that we have many Diablo products in the works,

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
and we have several, but I'm here to talk to you about the first one

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
that you can expect today.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
This project is called Diablo Immortal,

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
and it's actually a special, unique Diablo experience

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
developed for mobile phones.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
You know, everybody has a mobile phone, and mobile phones are growing,

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
and we want to invite everybody to participate in the Diablo experience,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
because this is a universe we want everybody to enjoy.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
You know, show the trailer, show the hype, you know, build all that stuff,

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
and then continue.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Diablo Immortal is actually playable on the show floor today,

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
and we hope you'll all have a chance to play it.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
And I hope to be back real soon to talk to you about what's next for Diablo,

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
because I know what you're all waiting for.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Right? How's that? How's that?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Much better.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Much better, thank you.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
So, a lot of that is in the messaging, right?

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
And this is a very, like, this whole way this is blown up and everything

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
is a very interesting study in like Blizzard,

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
and like messaging in general, not just like Blizzard specifically,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
but this is the type of thing that like video game PR people

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
are going to study for a long, long time.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
Because Blizzard's fan base, as we've talked about on OLR before,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
is a very, like, usually loyal fan base.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
I mean, you know, I think part of the reason that Overwatch took off

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
in the first place is that all these people who usually wouldn't play

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
first person shooters did it because Blizzard did it.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
And Blizzard made a version of it that was very accessible

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
that people wanted to play, and I think that got people very excited.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
I think Blizzard did make an error in assuming that their company

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
that has been founded around these PC, primarily, I think it's fair,

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
yes, of course they have console releases too,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
but those are usually the sideshows, right?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Most of their releases are PC.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
They've always been a very PC-based company.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
The fact that, you know, their tentpole announcement of BlizzCon

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
essentially was, well, you PC fans, guess what?

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
We've got a mobile game for you, and it's actually a PC game

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
that you all know and love from PC.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
We're putting it on a mobile device.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
And I think that's why a lot of people are very like,

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
like, if the project had been something like,

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
and I know you're all going to laugh at me, but I don't give a fuck,

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
like Diablo Go, like something like Pokemon Go

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
or something that is just not Diablo 3 looking on a cell phone,

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
it'd been like a completely different type of game,

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
I wonder if people would have had the same very negative reaction to it.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Probably, yeah.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
But here's the other thing with that.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
I'm not going to completely say that Blizzard is 100% in the wrong here,

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
because, I mean, it does make a lot of sense to do mobile phone games.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
There's a lot of companies making a lot of money off of mobile games.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
I do think Diablo as a mobile game is probably an idea

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
that would have been better about three, four years ago,

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
but this is where Blizzard's slow development calendar

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
to take the time to get everything right,

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
this is one of those, I hate to say it,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
this is one of those places where that kind of hurts them, I think,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
is that they're a little late to the party with Diablo Immortal.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
Whatever, I mean, that's actually not the biggest sin,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
so you're a little late to the game, whatever.

23:02.000 --> 23:08.000
I do think, though, that a lot of people are really kidding themselves

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
when they talk about how much they hate this game,

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
because here's the reality, this is a free game,

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
all these haters out there and stuff, they're going to download it,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
they're going to try it, you can tell me all you want,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
nah, nah, nah, I'm not going to, yes you are.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
You're going to try it because it's free.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I'm not saying the game's going to be successful,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I'm not saying the game's going to make oodles of money,

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
but I seem to remember when Nintendo first announced Miitomo,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
and then subsequently Super Mario Run,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
there was a little bit of negativity on those games as well.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
You know what, a lot of people downloaded those games anyway.

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
Now, to be fair, I also realized that Super Mario Run

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
ended up kind of getting a lot of flack,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
and Nintendo did not consider that game a success

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
because just because of the fact people downloaded it

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
didn't mean that people ended up dropping the $10

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
to actually buy the levels.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
So it's like Super Mario Run had a ton of people

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
that downloaded it for free to check it out,

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
and then very few of that actually converted over.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
So I'm not saying necessarily that Diablo Immortal

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
is going to be this runaway success of a game,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
but I do think there's a lot of people out there

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
that are kidding themselves when they say they're not even going to try it.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Sorry, I don't believe it.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
So, you know, maybe people will now go further out of spite or whatever,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
but the reality is it's free.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
There's going to be at least a lot of people who downloaded

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
to tell their friends, oh, I played it and it sucks.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
I don't know. Maybe it won't suck? I don't know.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
You know, I would be kind of a hypocrite to sit here and say,

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
I'm going to hate this game just because it's a mobile game

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
when I spend all the time I do playing things like

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
Ingress, Pokemon Go, and I responded pretty favorably

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
to Nintendo's latest offering, which is more of an original game.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
Dragalia Lost is actually not a bad mobile game at all.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
So I'm not necessarily ready to write Diablo off completely

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
because it's a mobile game.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
I just think their messaging, all they had to do,

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
all they had to do, Loki, just show a logo for Diablo IV.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Just show the fucking logo for Diablo IV. That's it.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Pull a Nintendo.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Why not?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Sure.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Pull a Bethesda.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
What did Bethesda do?

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
What did Bethesda do?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
And they're not getting Reddit for this at all.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
Bethesda announced that the next Elder Scrolls game

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
is going to be a mobile game.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
It's a mobile game that they're going to put on PlayStation 4 and Switch, yes.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
But the next Elder Scrolls game is a mobile game.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
Did you all forget Bethesda just did a similar thing at E3

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
and did not get dragged over the coals for this?

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
Bethesda announced their next Elder Scrolls,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
this big series where everybody's waiting for the next one,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
is a mobile game.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
But the reason why they didn't get fucking dragged,

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
because what did they immediately, immediately follow it up with?

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
What was the very next announcement?

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
Well, a couple that star...

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
I'm using hyperbole. What was the next announcement?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Elder Scrolls VI.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Elder Scrolls VI.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
And all they did was they showed, like, a painting,

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
a little drumbeat, and the Elder Scrolls VI logo.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
And you know that game ain't fucking coming out for years.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
And it'll still be buggy when it's released.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
Yet, did anybody give that mobile Elder Scrolls shit?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Nope.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Now, I'm sure some will want to argue,

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
but the mobile thing doesn't look like a reskin of an existing game,

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
but we're getting in the weeds a little bit here, okay?

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
I'm saying is that messaging is, like, really important.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
That's my point, okay?

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
I don't really know this Diablo game truly, truly,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
until I actually get my hands on it to play it.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
So anyway, little rant there.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
All right.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
DungeonBuster in chat says,

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
I'm not surprised that Blizzard did this with Diablo.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
In a way, it was kind of inevitable.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Let's see, DungeonBuster also says,

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Blizzard needs to make money,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
and that money is going to be used to fund other projects

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
that they will be working on.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
Hopefully, one of those projects will be on better messaging.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
As H2O 100 Matt points out,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Hearthstone got so much shit when it was announced,

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
it got 25 million downloads within the first three months of its release.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Let's see, Tigerclaw says,

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Here's an idea.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
Make a new StarCraft or a new sequel one of their classic games.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
How about a new Lost Vikings?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Well, I mean, to be fair, Tigerclaw,

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
I think the Warcraft III remaster is kind of where they're headed.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
I mean, Blizzard has a classics game division at this point,

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
and I don't think this will be the last remaster.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
I really truly believe one of the other projects they're working on right now

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
is a Diablo remaster,

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
because they said they had multiple Diablo products in development.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
One of them is Diablo IV, duh.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
One of them is a Diablo remaster.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
It's just a question, is it Diablo I or Diablo II?

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
Probably Diablo II, but we'll see, I suppose.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
Well, that's why they did Warcraft III and not Warcraft I or II.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
DungeonBuster, with my analogy there,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
saying Bethesda did that totally right.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Let's see, BobbyBlackWolf says,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Maybe Blizzard should have learned from the massive boycott

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
they got over having colors in Diablo III.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
I don't remember, I mean, that was a crippling boycott.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I think whole tens of people didn't buy it.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
I do remember that one BlizzCon in particular,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
the big announcement at the very end

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
was that the Demon Hunter is coming to Diablo III.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
That was the final announcement at one of the BlizzCons.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
So, I don't know.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
Like, maybe they need to reapproach the expectations

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
they're setting for BlizzCon?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
I don't know.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
I feel like the one year I went to BlizzCon,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
do you know what the tentpole announcement was?

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Overwatch, okay?

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
That was the best year to go to BlizzCon, honestly,

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
as far as press conferences and unveilings go,

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
because not only was it this brand new Blizzard property

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
and everybody was fucking psyched about it,

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
but they had that whole Pixar quality movie trailer thing

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
that kicked it off.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
That was a beautiful year.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
That was a beautiful thing to see in person.

28:56.000 --> 29:01.000
It's interesting how high and low

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
the various BlizzCons can go.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Alright.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Bobby Blackwool says,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Rob has the shirt with the rainbows and unicorns

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
around the Diablo III logo.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I don't, actually.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
I want that shirt, but I don't have it.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I did.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Oh, no you don't.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
No, I have a similar one that says,

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
I'm dead inside, with the unicorns and the rainbows

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
and all that stuff.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
It just says I'm dead inside.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
I've worn that to host Rocky Horror before,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
but I do not have a Diablo III.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
And it was my icon on the VoG forums was that thing,

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
when we had those,

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
but I actually never did get that shirt,

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
although I wanted it.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
Oh, and Bobby's reminding me it was a huge boycott

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
because there were colors in Diablo III

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
and it wasn't drab and dark like Diablo should be.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Well, here's the thing, guys,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
and maybe we'll kind of end on this note

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
and then we can move on with the show,

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
is that I don't, like, here's the thing,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
like, with all the hate and stuff

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
that Blizzard's getting right now,

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
I feel like Blizzard is a little more open to feedback

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
than a lot of other companies.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
I feel like Blizzard is really gonna go back to their,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
like, Blizzard's not stupid, you guys.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Blizzard's gonna go back Monday morning

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
and they're gonna really ask themselves,

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
what the fuck happened?

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
That's, I can just imagine right now,

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
they're all getting in a room.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
There goes Jay Allen, the guy running it,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Wyatt, the Diablo guy,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
all the guys, the big guys you saw at BlizzCon,

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
they're all gonna be sitting around a room

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Monday morning, shut the door, thank you.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Okay, what the fuck happened?

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
That's gonna be a conversation

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
8.30 a.m. at Blizzard headquarters tomorrow morning.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
So, they're gonna really try to reevaluate

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
and work on some of that messaging,

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
but I just think, I think it was a bad idea

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
to not immediately remind people

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
there are many Diablo products in development

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
and this is one of them.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
I know Blizzard tried to put out a letter online

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
to reduce some of those expectations.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
That wasn't, clearly it wasn't enough.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
They needed to reiterate it on stage.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
What is their fear about saying the words

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Diablo 4 on stage?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Are they worried that they might ultimately

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
cancel it or something?

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
Like, how is Blizzard not going to make a Diablo 4,

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
eventually?

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
This is, I don't know, very strange.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
But anyway, I do think Blizzard

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
is gonna hear some of this feedback

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
and I think we may end up seeing,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I think there's a very strong possibility

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
this thing does not stay exclusive to mobile

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
because we know that mobile-type games like,

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
oh fuck, I don't know, Jetpack Joyride and stuff

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
will come out on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
So, maybe the ultimate thing that happens with this

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
is that Diablo Immortal ends up on consoles as well.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
I think there's a very distinct, and maybe even PC.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
I think there's a very distinct possibility that happens.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I'm not gonna say that it's not gonna be filled

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
with microtransactions and all that stuff all of a sudden,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
but I'm just saying that it's a very unique possibility

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
that they end up not making this mobile exclusive.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
I don't know.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
But their third-party partnership,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
I think that's what makes it a little bit trickier

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
because I'm not sure their third-party partner

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
develops for those type of things.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
So, I don't know.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Anyway, Tigerclaw points out Hearthstone was a mobile game,

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
then got ported to consoles.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
I actually, you're kind of a little wrong.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
You think it was a mobile game.

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
Originally, it was an iPad and PC release, or tablet.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
The mobile came later because they had to condense

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
the interface down for mobile.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
It was actually originally for tablets

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
when people were talking more about iPads

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
and that sort of thing more often, which, for whatever reason,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
we don't really talk about tablet PCs and Macs

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
as much as we used to, which is interesting.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
But I do seem to remember the original release of that

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
was on tablets and PC.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Let's see.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Dark Tetsuya says,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I don't know what I heard on the YouTube trailers.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Comments are getting deleted.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
They even re-uploaded one of the trailers

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
to try and stave off the downvotes,

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
but I don't believe it worked out.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Well, of course it didn't work out.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
We all know Streisand Effect,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
and that whole thing is in full effect.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
You cannot remove that type of negativity from the internet,

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
and I don't know who they're kidding.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
But Blizzard probably handles PR companies to do a lot of this,

33:11.000 --> 33:16.000
and it's probably what the PR company's trying to do to save face.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
I don't freaking know.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
But all I know is that I would expect within a month,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
probably less,

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
Blizzard's going to have a big something to say about this.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
And honestly, a lot of it's probably just going to be a reiteration

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
of the letter they already wrote.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
This is one of many Diablo products in the works.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
So please look forward to it, I suppose.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
All right.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Anyway, Rama in chat says,

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
Diablo Mobile will end up on Switch, 3DS, and Vita.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Oh, Rama, nothing's coming out for the Vita.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
I was going to say, what's a Vita?

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Nothing's going to come out for the Vita anymore.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
In Japan, maybe. I don't know.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I think they've killed the support there, too.

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
Not really, because we still see releases on the Vita calendar.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Sony's official.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Yeah, Sony's official.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Hey, as long as people are buying the games, they'll make them.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
But yeah, I think it's going to start scaling way back in Japan pretty soon.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I think that's going to be about the end of it.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
Rama reminds me that's the joke. Yes, I know, I know.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
All right, let's get into our gaming weeks.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
And then I'm going to invite a special guest on the show

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
to talk about his gaming week.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
So, Loki, why don't you talk to us a little bit about your gaming week.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
How was your gaming week?

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
Well, I did some streaming on Twitch of DDR Extreme.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
I originally had planned on upgrading my machine,

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
well, maybe downgrading my machine to a fourth plus.

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
However, the CD drive that I got, while it is good for, actually,

34:38.000 --> 34:46.000
the DVD drive that I have is good enough to run the games that I have,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
it's not good enough to run the Super Disk,

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
so I have a new drive coming in its place.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
But at least I was able to replace that without breaking anything,

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
and I got to take apart the 573 board and stuff like that.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
So that'll be coming probably in a couple weeks.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
I think they said deliver in the 19th, so about two weeks away.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
And then I did get to play a little bit more Red Dead Redemption 2.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
I still don't really know what the hell to do in that game.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
I think I'm just probably going to go through the story.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I kind of want to get all the achievements and stuff

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
and then just cheat like crazy through it,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
because that's where the fun is.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
But I haven't quite gotten there yet.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
But it's a very fun game still.

35:30.000 --> 35:37.000
And then I did finally dust off my VR headset to play some VR games.

35:37.000 --> 35:42.000
I did get enough time to play Tetris Effect, both in VR and in 4K.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
So the 4K, you know, it looked good.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
I prefer it in VR.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
For me, it was easier to see the screen and just be able to,

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
even with the zoom function that they have in Tetris Effect,

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
it was just easier to see what I was doing.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
And it was easier to appreciate some of the stuff that was going on around it.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
It was kind of hard to notice some of the background changes and stuff in the 4K version,

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
which is weird, but I don't know.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
I guess it was kind of meant for VR in the first place, so I'm down with that.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
But with that being said, I still don't like the fact,

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
and I know Bobby can probably relate to this,

36:20.000 --> 36:29.000
the stupid drifting thing where the screen will drift slightly to the left all the time.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
And I get it that I can put my headset on the floor for a little bit,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
and it's supposed to solve that problem.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
And usually you can just reset your...

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
Yeah, Bobby was talking about that the Tetris Effect didn't have re-centering.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Exactly.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
Well, now, to be fair, this could be a demo versus retail thing.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Right, right. I understand that.

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
But typically, even in demos for that stuff they have where you can re-center,

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
but I couldn't re-center it this way.

36:50.000 --> 36:55.000
So I ended up having to turn almost 45 degrees to the left to see the screen,

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
and it was ridiculous.

36:57.000 --> 37:04.000
And at this point in time, the PlayStation VR has been out for what?

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Like a year or two now?

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Yeah, it's coming up on two years.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
Why haven't they fixed this? Why?

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Why haven't they fixed this yet?

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
This is ridiculous that this is still an issue this late in the game.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Fix your shit.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Why is this still a problem?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I know we're not the only ones having this problem.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Why can't this be fixed?

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
Or, hey, occasionally just have it drift to the right to offset, you know,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
the fucking drifting to the left.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
I don't understand why they can't just fix that shit.

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
So, yeah, that was my only gripe there, but it's a great game.

37:35.000 --> 37:40.000
I look forward to the full version when I get that unlocked, I think, on Friday.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Yeah, it's really soon, right?

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Not this week, but next, right?

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
No, it's this week.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Oh, shoot. Nice. Okay, cool.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Is that it for your gaming week?

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
That's it.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
My gaming week?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Oh, at Pokemon Go.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
I'm sorry, and I wanted to say I like the adventure sync thing,

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
because that's pretty cool.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I finally got the Fitbit thing to work, too,

37:58.000 --> 38:05.000
and what's great is the Google Fit thing, it does not calculate steps very well.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
It over calculates the steps, but that works in my favor when it comes to...

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Well, and then it works in Niantic's favor, too,

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
because you're buying more incubators.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
No, not really.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
Well, I don't have to buy it. I never am buying Pokeballs now,

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
but all of a sudden when that kicked in, it's like,

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
oh, here, here's 30 Pokeballs.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
I'm like, cool, I guess.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Nice.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Well, if that's it for you, then my gaming week...

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
All right, I'll start with Pokemon Go as well,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
because you know nobody plays mobile games,

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
but I participated in the Gengar raid day on Saturday,

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
and I was very lucky this time.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
My very first Gengar raid was shiny,

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
so I was like, cool, this never happens to me.

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
There's been some shiny days. I didn't get any on the Articuno day.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
I didn't get any, so it was nice to just kind of have that out of the way.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
I couldn't even tell it was shiny, because the difference is so subtle.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
The only way I knew was the little special icon, and I was like...

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Yeah, that's like...

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
And I also exclaimed loudly, I'm like, is this...

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Because it did the little star thing when it showed up.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I was like, is this a shiny?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
And then, of course, three people next to me were like, huh?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
And looked at my phone, and one of my buddies tasked me,

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
yeah, it's a shiny, it's shiny.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
And I was like, oh, shit, wow, cool.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
I finally won the shiny lottery for a change.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
So that was kind of nice.

39:17.000 --> 39:22.000
So I did that. I did the Gengar day.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
And then, of course, I stuck with it.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Alan ended up getting a shiny, too,

39:26.000 --> 39:32.000
and we raid over in the business district not far from here in the next town over,

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
and then we kind of go throughout all those businesses and do all the gyms there.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
So we kind of walk a big route that's maybe like 10 or 11.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
I mean, we probably could do more gyms,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
but most people want to stop after like 10

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
because they've burned their five free raid passes

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
and whatever maybe they had left over in their inventory.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
I think I still have like 25 extra raid passes

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
because of all the boxes I bought for incubators.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
So I'm more than happy to burn, burn, burn raid passes.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
But anyway, I got my one shiny, so I'm happy there.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Other stuff, I've also played the Tetris Effect demo,

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
and I loved it. I really, really loved it.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
I did a stream when I played it for the very first time.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
So a cheap plug for my Twitch channel over at Rob Roberts.

40:11.000 --> 40:16.000
I played that on Twitch, and yeah, I just love it so far.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
I mean, I know it's just a demo, so I can't really give you my full thoughts,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
but I'm really anxious to play more.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
Like, I just, the immersion, the beauty of those,

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
even the three skins that were available.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
Like, you know, obviously everybody loved that trailer song,

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
which is the first skin.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
The second skin had a great song,

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
and it was interesting enough where the design of that

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
really kind of messes with your head.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
How, like, the little lines in the block kind of go back and forth,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
and they change colors.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
I don't know about you, but that was really messing with me when I was playing.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
So it was kind of neat.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
And then that third stage with, you know, the fire and the drum beats

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
and the kakak and all that stuff,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
and the stage would actually change,

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
and then as you're going, more and more people show up

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
to bow down to the Tetris thing and all that.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
It was just really cool. It's just so well done.

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
It really is luminous meets Tetris, and that's fine.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
That's what I wanted. That's great. Perfect.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
So, yeah, this is, so far I'm really loving it,

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
and I'm really excited for the retail release.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
I unboxed the VR this week with the intention of playing the demo on VR,

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
but then ended up going to a movie and I just didn't get around to it.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
But to be fair, I also have an unopened copy of Diablo 3 for Switch,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
also waiting for me to go play.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
So Tetris Effect in VR is not the only thing that I've been neglecting.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
But I forgot how many parts there are for that PlayStation VR.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
They have to, like, number everything.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
It's not that many.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
It seems, it's a lot.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
It's not.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
It's like leg bones connected to the ankle bone.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
The ankle bone's putting together the PlayStation VR.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Let's see, what else?

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I've still been playing World of Warcraft,

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
working on my alliance character that I boosted is now up to 116,

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
my Affliction Warlock, so still enjoying that,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
and been playing that a bit.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
And I guess, I guess that's really it for me to say.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundromaty

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
with vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, icon.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Yeah, that's it for my gaming week.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
Go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
S2100 Matt says, Shiny Gengar was so lame.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
We're shiny.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
It's Gengar with a gray Instagram filter.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Bobby Black Wolf says, Rob is talking about how much fun he's having,

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
and all I'm hearing is dead game, dead game, dead game, whatever.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
How much money did he make last month?

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
Anyway, we're going to break form a little bit here,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
and we're going to invite a friend of ours to come on the show here

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
for a little bit to talk about his gaming week,

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
because I know there's a very kind of unique game,

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
new game that came out,

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
and I know our friend has some strong opinions on this,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
and the more I was hearing about this game,

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
I was like, what in the hell is this?

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
And I want to talk about it.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
So welcome to the show.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
You know him from such shows as Ranger Pride.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Welcome back, Shane, to the network.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Hello.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Hey, Shane, how you doing?

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
I am fine.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
It's good to hear from you.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
What have you been up to lately?

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
I know your shows have been on a little bit of a hiatus,

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
but everything going on for you?

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
Well, I quit my show, so it didn't matter about what kind of hiatus it's on anymore.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
Well, I bet your fans are very sad to hear that,

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
but you've got a lot of other stuff going on, right?

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
No, but that's okay.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
All right.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
You've got things going on like playing games, right?

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
How is your gaming week?

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
Oh, yeah, I'm up to nine shiny pincers right now in Pokémon GO.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
You're up to nine shiny pincers?

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Yes.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Wait.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
I want to do more.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Everyone brace yourselves.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
I'm going to piss Shane off.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
Ready?

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
No, I already know.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
I saw your Twitter post.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
How many shiny Gengars did you get?

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Zero.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Sorry.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
Okay, the one time you don't get a shiny, Shane, let me have my moment.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
I guess you could just trade one to him.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
I don't have two of them.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
I only got one.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Oh, okay.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Well, you should still trade it to me.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
I don't think so.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
But I got my one shiny pincer, so I'm happy.

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
But anyway, we've been criticized about talking about Pokémon GO too much on this podcast,

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
so I want to talk about a different game.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
Pokémon GO is amazing, even if it's a crappy game like GO.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Well, then let's bring back PokéStop Podcast.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
What do you say?

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Potentially I could be down.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
All right.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
To be continued.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
All right.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
But anyway, you want to talk about a different game this week, right?

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
Well, you wanted me to talk about it, but I am more than happy to talk about it.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Okay.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
That's what I thought.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
That's what I thought.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
So tell us about this game.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
How is your game?

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
What have you been playing?

44:32.000 --> 44:39.000
I decided I'm a masochist, and I purchased The Quiet Man.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
The Quiet Man.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
I've never...

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Is that The Wicker Man?

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
A Quiet Place?

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
I don't know what that means.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
What is this game?

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
It doesn't make sense to me.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
It's a game...

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
I don't remember who makes it.

44:49.000 --> 44:56.000
It's a fairly well-known developer, but it's published by Square Enix.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
It came out of nowhere, I believe it was at E3, and it was just this weird-looking game

45:00.000 --> 45:06.000
that had live-action video mixed in with regular PS4 graphics.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
It looked like it beat them up.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
Nobody knew what was going on, and people were intrigued and scared.

45:12.000 --> 45:18.000
Mixing full motion video with games, isn't that something they did back when CD-ROM technology

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
was first out, like Phantasmagoria?

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
Is that basically what this is?

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
No, it's like...

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
You remember...

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
What's the game that's on Xbox?

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Night Trap?

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
No, not Night Trap.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Alright, next time you're gonna tell a joke, have it ready to go.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
It wasn't a joke, I was just referring...

45:38.000 --> 45:44.000
It is a game I didn't play, but you liked it because it was half TV series, half...

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Alan Wake.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Alan Wake.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
No, this is nothing like that at all.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
No, it's the other one.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Not Alan Wake.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
The other game they did.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Remedy.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Quantum Break?

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
What?

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Quantum Break?

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Yes, Quantum Break.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
Quantum Break, yes.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
Thank you.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
No, this again, nothing like that, because that was an amazing game.

46:00.000 --> 46:05.000
No, I'm just saying that they're similar with the live-action and gameplay.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
This game is crap.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I don't even know if I would say it's similar in that vein.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Let Shane talk.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
Wow, you'll never hear Rob say that again.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
That's true.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Enjoy this moment while it lasts.

46:18.000 --> 46:23.000
Okay, so PlayStation Network had it on sale for a couple dollars cheaper, and I was like,

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
what the heck?

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
I'm kind of intrigued by this game, because I like games that are bad, but they're so

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
bad that they're good.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
One of my all-time favorite games, Rising Xan.

46:33.000 --> 46:39.000
That is a terrible game, but it is funny, it's not really that terrible to play, and

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
it's just one of my favorites.

46:41.000 --> 46:47.000
This game is probably the worst game I've ever played in my life.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Why?

46:49.000 --> 46:55.000
This game is worse than Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival, and that's not even a game, because

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
a little two-year-old can beat you at that game, in quote marks, because you don't do

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
anything.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
Is it worse than Superman 64?

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
Yes, I'd rather play that.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Let me explain.

47:11.000 --> 47:18.000
So the premise of this game, from what I can tell, is that you are this guy who happens

47:18.000 --> 47:24.000
to be deaf, and you beat up people for the first half of the game.

47:24.000 --> 47:30.000
Okay, this game is really racist, too, I think, because you don't get a lot of information

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
as to what's going on, because you're deaf, and the developers decided, well, then there

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
should be no audio in the game.

47:38.000 --> 47:44.000
So you're playing the game, people are talking, it's not subtitled, I don't read lips, I'm

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
just guessing what's going on half the time.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
It's an interesting artistic decision.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
It's a premise that could work.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
Yeah, I'm all for having a deaf protagonist.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Yeah, that's cool.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
Yeah, it's an interesting twist, yeah.

47:59.000 --> 48:06.000
Yeah, so the first half of the game, I'm beating up Hispanic gang members.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
That's all I do.

48:07.000 --> 48:12.000
There's four different models, four or five, and you just repeatedly beat them up.

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
And you have a couple techniques or buttons you can hit for different attacks.

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
The game doesn't tell you what each thing does, except in a little neon light picture.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
Like, you can go to the controller select screen, or the control screen, rather, and

48:27.000 --> 48:34.000
you'll hit square, and it'll show this neon sign of your guy punching, and then triangles

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
is the neon sign of your guy kicking.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
No words or anything to really tell you what's going on, so some of the controls I still

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
don't understand, because I don't read neon light signs.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
All those years of BeatMania 2DX and you don't read neon light signs?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
No, no I don't.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Okay.

48:51.000 --> 48:56.000
So, oh god, just where'd it go with this?

48:56.000 --> 49:03.000
You beat those five same characters up in very generic places constantly, and it's

49:04.000 --> 49:10.000
spliced in between some of the action sequences are flashbacks.

49:10.000 --> 49:16.000
And your mom gets shot and killed by one of the gang members.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Well that's not very nice.

49:17.000 --> 49:22.000
So you think, you guys aren't going to play, I don't care, I'm going to spoil everything.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
This is a terrible game.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
The gang members had nothing to do with it.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
So when you're fighting, after you have that first flashback, occasionally, when you kill

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
an enemy, the screen slows down.

49:34.000 --> 49:40.000
You still see your terribly animated character and the terribly animated enemies.

49:40.000 --> 49:47.000
And then in the background, they try to overlay images, like these flashbacks are real people,

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
like real footage stuff.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
They overlay that over the game screen.

49:51.000 --> 49:59.000
So it's really jarring to see these poorly animated computer modeled characters fight

49:59.000 --> 50:07.000
while really badly acted FMV is going on in the background of the apartment you're in.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
It's really, really bad.

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000
I mean, this question should be asked though, Shane.

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
And you probably won't understand this, but humor me, okay?

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Is it like The Room bad?

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I don't know what that is.

50:22.000 --> 50:27.000
You know the movie The Room that's so bad that people, okay, or Showgirls bad?

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
I've never seen that on camera.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
It's a movie that's so bad that it's actually kind of good when everybody sits around and

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
makes fun of it.

50:33.000 --> 50:38.000
So here's what's fun about this game too, is there's like long cut scenes with people

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
talking that you can't understand it and there's no subtitles.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
So you're watching two minutes of someone.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
That's what really threw me the first time.

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
Now, I thought I heard something about that they were going to patch in audio or something

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
like that.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
Like there's a patch coming from-

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
Who cares?

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
It's not going to make the game good.

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
The gameplay, you can hit the square button over and over and that's all you really need

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
to do for the most part to get through any area.

51:05.000 --> 51:11.000
Because your character will kind of just randomly teleport somewhere to another enemy.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
It's not even like there's a movement of your character.

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
He literally teleports right next to them.

51:17.000 --> 51:23.000
Yeah, and like Loki was saying, the first time after you do the intro, you talk with

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
your friend.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Spoiler, he's the one that killed your mom so he's not your friend.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
Oh my God, Shane.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
You just like ruined the whole game.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
It doesn't matter.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
Nobody should play this game.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I'm trying to make sure they don't.

51:33.000 --> 51:42.000
Like, it's a six or seven minute full cut scene of these actors talking and signing

51:42.000 --> 51:49.000
with no sound, no subtitles, and you're just sitting there watching and making up your

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
own story at that point because it's way more interesting than what's going on.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
Or if you're like my boyfriend, you kind of fall asleep during it because it's really

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
boring.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
Or the best part where they just purposefully make it so that you don't understand the story.

52:02.000 --> 52:08.000
There's one part where the protagonist is looking at a ransom note, but you're looking

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
at the ransom note from a camera angle behind his head so you can't see what's on the ransom

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
note because even though he's deaf, it doesn't mean that you can't read the ransom note to

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
be able to gain the knowledge of whatever it is that he's seeing.

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
They purposely make it so that it's impossible to follow the story.

52:25.000 --> 52:30.000
One of my favorite parts though is shortly after that, you're talking to your friend

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
who's the bad guy.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Remember that everybody, so you don't play this.

52:33.000 --> 52:38.000
Wasn't there like some cop guy or something that was also bad?

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
This is where it gets racist for that.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
We'll get to that in a second.

52:41.000 --> 52:49.000
But your friend is talking to you with his, like he's got his back turned to your character

52:49.000 --> 52:54.000
and he says something to your character with his back turned to your character who is deaf

52:54.000 --> 53:00.000
and your character responds by talking.

53:00.000 --> 53:04.000
Is there going to be a twist maybe when they put in the dialogue that this whole thing

53:04.000 --> 53:09.000
was this weird avant-garde art thing and that it actually makes a lot of sense when you

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
actually get dialogue later?

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
No, I don't think so.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
I don't even care.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
And that segues into my next point.

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
So first of all, super racist, the first half of the game you beat up on Hispanic guys,

53:22.000 --> 53:28.000
the second half you beat up on black guys, and then your hero is this white cop.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I'm like, okay, this is hilarious.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Oh, you're trying to save a white woman too.

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
And you're like the most generic white guy ever.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
It's so annoying.

53:38.000 --> 53:43.000
So for every like avant-garde artistic decision, there's some pretty, pardon the pun,

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
tone deaf ones too.

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
And then for no reason, he turns into a magical bird man at the end.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Yes.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
Okay.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
Yes.

53:51.000 --> 53:58.000
So that was the only okay part of the entire game when I got to that point because my homework

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
for this call was to beat the game and I did not succeed.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
And I'll tell you why.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
So I got to that point.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
It was kind of fun.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Like you were overpowered.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
It was some neat little attacks that lasted like for five minutes.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
It got really boring really quick.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
And then you have to go beat up on your friend again.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
And I did that.

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
And once I beat up on him, I think something failed to trigger like a cut scene or something

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
and I couldn't progress.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
I had to turn off my game, started back over.

54:26.000 --> 54:30.000
It put me about 40 minutes back and I said, I'm done.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
This game is so bad.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
I just don't care anymore.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
I'm going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
MXC is apparently following the saga and says, yes, there will be sound,

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
but when they add it as a patch in a week.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
I thought that was a thing.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
So you got to play it again when they do audio?

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
Nope.

54:45.000 --> 54:50.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, and it's disappointing to hear how terrible this is.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
I mean, how often do you hear about a new IP?

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
Well, this is a new IP that costs $15, right?

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Like, yeah, I got for like 13 because it was on sale.

54:58.000 --> 55:02.000
So clearly they knew something was wrong.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
Okay.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
I liken this to back at my Konami days when we were working on a poker game,

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
like seven years after the poker fad had ended.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
And everybody thought it was a bad idea.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
They pumped all this money into it.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
They put out trailers.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
It was coming out for Xbox Live.

55:18.000 --> 55:23.000
And they finally realized it was not like just cut your losses and run.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Don't put it out.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
Somebody needed to tell Square Enix to do it to this game.

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
Do you think Blizzard needs to be told that about Diablo Immortal?

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
I don't care.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
Like, I love the Switch one.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
I'm having a blast with it.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
They can do whatever they want on mobile.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I'm not going to touch it, probably.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
That's interesting how you can have that perspective,

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
where like mobile doesn't affect you.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
And like a game that you don't want to play doesn't affect you,

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
and that's okay.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
Isn't that fascinating?

55:51.000 --> 55:55.000
If it was some integration to a game I like, Final Fantasy XIV,

55:55.000 --> 55:59.000
that was terribly done, Final Fantasy XIV, then yeah, I might be upset.

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
But this is a standalone game that has nothing to do with screwing up,

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
you know, something I like, Final Fantasy XIV.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
Other comments in chat.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
MXC wants to ask to both you and Loki,

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
do you guys have anything to say about the fact that the protagonist is

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
maybe in love with a woman who looks exactly like his dead mom?

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
Yeah.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
This game has so many issues.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I thought it was her at first.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
I was like, why is my best friend who turns out to be the villain,

56:29.000 --> 56:34.000
like in all these pictures with my mom that got shot,

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
and he's looking like he does now.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
And then later on, you know, because there's no subtitles,

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
and nothing that I can hear to tell me what's really going on.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
Then I put it together that she just looks like her,

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
and it's not maybe actually her.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
I don't know.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
The game is dumb.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
We don't know because you can't tell what's going on.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
But yeah, seriously.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
It's the actors in a different way.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
If you're somewhat interested,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
just to kind of know what we're talking about here,

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
and the only reason I know any of this is because I watched the video

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
that Jim Sterling did.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
He did a 20-minute video talking about this game and showing off the poor.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
There's no animation transitions, for one,

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
which is another nice thing, too.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
So when you're punching someone, they're falling over.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
They just pop back up, and then they get punched again,

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
and they fall back down.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
They pop back up again.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
We need to punch them.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
The only way I know, I went and watched it on Twitch

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
the minute Shane told me about how bad this game was.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
I went, and there was people playing it for extra life.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
I guess they were punishing themselves for donations

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
by playing this game on their Twitch streams.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
One of my favorite things about the game

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
is that your walking animation doesn't look terrible,

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
because parts of this game look okay.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
It looks like an up-resed PS3 game, maybe.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
It seriously sounds like a CD-ROM game out of 1994.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
It really does.

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
But it plays like, I don't know, a Coleco game or something.

57:43.000 --> 57:48.000
But you walk into a wall or an object,

57:48.000 --> 57:52.000
and your character gets stopped in the motion that he was in

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
as he was walking into that object.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
It's not like he just stands still.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
He's literally stuck in that pose until you move.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
I just don't know what this game is

58:03.000 --> 58:07.000
besides a waste of maybe $15.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Well, Shane, I appreciate you coming on the show

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
to spoil the game to make sure nobody will ever play it.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
That was very kind of you.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Nobody should play it.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
Don't waste your money.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
If you want to give somebody a bad present, that's it.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
But do you really want to risk your friendship?

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Since you brought up Konami in your years there,

58:23.000 --> 58:28.000
which game was worse, A Quiet Man or The Winx?

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Oh, A Quiet Man. The Winx was awesome.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
What are you talking about?

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
I enjoyed my time with that game.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
There is nothing enjoyable about this game whatsoever.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
We can talk about all that now, right?

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
That you were a tester on The Winx and all that stuff?

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
Yeah, when I was in between DVRs and stuff, yeah.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I was on The Winx, and it was fun.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
It was such a better game than this.

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
There are so many games I used to think I hated,

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
and now I would welcome them with open arms.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
I remember I went to Blockbuster and rented Morrowind,

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
and I thought it was so bad I took it back

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
and rented Unlimited Saga, and that was bad too.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I thought that was the worst it could possibly get.

59:08.000 --> 59:13.000
And then I played The Quiet Man, and it's just...

59:14.000 --> 59:21.000
I wish this wasn't one of the first notable death protagonists,

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
if maybe the first notable one,

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
because it's just a bad thing to be attached to, I feel like.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Shane, let's quickly...

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
I got to get back to the show because we do have news to get to,

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
but I thought since you did spend 15-plus minutes talking about a bad game,

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
I would maybe give you 60 seconds to talk about Tetris Effect, a good game?

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
Oh, it's so good.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I've played the demo so many times.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
I meant to play just the first three stages the night it released,

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
and I played it for like an hour and a half instead,

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
and it was still just the same first three stages.

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
You know what was weird, though, is I'm not 100% sold on the VR mode.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I played it, and it didn't really grab me as much as I thought it would.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Interesting.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
So now we're two for three on VR,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
because Loki and Bobby preferred the VR.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
You don't.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
No.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Maybe if I had a headset on, too, that might have helped,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
but I was just using a soundbar and my VR headset,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
and I definitely preferred playing it regular to that.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Interesting, because the common theme I kind of heard with Loki and Bobby

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
was that it was the immersion and the fact that it kind of took you out

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
of the rest of your room.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
That was the big thing for it.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
So maybe...

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Oh, maybe I was just too focused on the game

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
that it didn't really change my perspective.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Bobby does say, I had headphones on with a headset.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
What about you, Loki?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I had headphones.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Maybe that's the trick.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
That's probably it.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
That's what I'll need to do when it comes out for real.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
But hey, if you get it at Best Buy, you have to wait an extra week,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
so it kind of sucks.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Uh-oh.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
All right.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Well, Shane, I guess we're going to have to invite you back on OLR

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
in a couple weeks, because you and I are headed

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
to Final Fantasy Fan Fest in a couple weeks.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Yeah, and maybe I will buckle down and beat the quiet man

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
so you guys can all know exactly what I feel about it,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
because I haven't figured it out yet.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
All right.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Well, maybe you should wait a week for it to get this patch,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
apparently, that it's getting.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
No!

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I have to play it in the original artistic intent.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
That's right.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
It's not called the loud man.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
It's called the quiet man.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
It's not even necessarily a patch.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Like, they thought about it in the second hand.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
That's how the game ends.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
They're all like, you know, there's more secrets to be unlocked

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
and it has a countdown to the patch.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Wow.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
All right.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Oh, this is so bad.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
All right, Shane.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I hope the secret it unlocks is a way to get your money back.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
All right, Shane.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Well, the chatters really enjoyed hearing from you.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
SJ100Matt says Shane needs to come back more often.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
So don't be a stranger.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
We'll hear from you again soon, I hope.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
All right.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Bye.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Bye.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
All right.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Thanks, Shane.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And I'm going to bug him.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Did you hear what he said about that Pokestop podcast thing?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Yeah.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I'm going to bug him about that.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
All right.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
One thing.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Oh, I didn't get into this with Shane.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I had it up in the background because this was important too.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Apparently, one of the big things about the quiet man

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
is that a new song was written for it.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
So it actually has like an original song.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Hey, why would you waste the potential of that on this?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Such a terrible game.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Get this.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Do you know who that is doing the song?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
It's Imogen Heap.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
One of my favorite.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Now, I know not everybody probably knows who Imogen Heap is,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
but she's like legit one of my favorite musicians like ever.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
She did a great.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
She did them.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Everybody knows that song, hide and seek,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
because that's where the dear sister.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
All that came from.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
What you say.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
That was Imogen Heap, right?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And all that dear sister on Star Live and all those parodies.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
That was Imogen Heap.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
A lot of people know her band, Fru Fru,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
with Guy that did the Must Be Dreamin'.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
The one that was in the movie Garden State.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
So I think a lot of people probably have heard of Imogen Heap.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
But anyway, she did this song for the quiet.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And apparently, it's a waste of talent.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
That's really unfortunate.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I think that plays like at the ending credits or something like that.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
So it's kind of like the Leona Lewis song of Final Fantasy 13.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
You don't hear it until the closing credits basically.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Interesting.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
All right.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Spoiler alert.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
But yeah, go watch the Jim Sterling video

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
if you want to see what this game is all about.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
And honestly, after watching it, no.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I didn't know what this game was, and I don't care.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I know we're going to get an email that's really pissed off

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
about the spoilers that Shane dropped.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
But honestly, he did you a favor.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
It's a two hour long game.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
$15.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
All right.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And most of it's cut scenes.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Let's get into some news.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I don't really have a lot of announcements

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
except for the fact that we will not be here in two weeks

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
because of the Final Fantasy Fan Fest I just mentioned.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Shane and myself and some of our other friends

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
will be in Las Vegas.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Actually, that Sunday we will be driving back from Las Vegas,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
but that is a nine hour drive.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
I don't expect to be back in time for OLR, sadly.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
So we're just going to not have it that night.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
All right.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
All right.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
So one thing we didn't mention during the whole BlizzCon thing

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
is that Destiny 2 is now free

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
if you have a Blizzard Battle.net account.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
So you can actually go in there on your profile

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
and they have like gifts,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
and you can redeem the base game for free

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
up until the 18th of November.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Again, talk about it.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I know I went off on this earlier,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
but talk about a missed messaging opportunity.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I can't believe they buried that in the pregame show

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
and they didn't announce that.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Why didn't they announce that on stage?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Now, to be fair,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
maybe the problem is that Destiny is not a Blizzard game.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
And so if the guy from Destiny had come up at BlizzCon,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
that might have had a really weird reception

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
from the Blizzard fans

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
because I know not all of them are really into Destiny 2.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
They know that the company is called Activision Blizzard, right?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I know, I know.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Just saying.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
But to be fair,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
like if the dude came out,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
we'd probably be all like,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
who the hell are you? Get off the stage.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
But if he's out to say,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
hi, I'm giving away my game for free,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I think everybody would be like,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
oh, okay, cheers and applause.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Cheers for the free game.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Cheers and applause.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Like, you know,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
they're not going to boo him off the stage for that.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
So I do kind of think that was a really,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
again, poor missed messaging opportunity on Blizzard's part,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
which is going to be a bit of a theme of BlizzCon 2018, I think.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
But if you have, I mean, hey, free game in Destiny 2.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Exactly, I'm not sure.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
It was also free on PlayStation 4,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
like was it August, I think?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
It was like a plus title.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Yeah, it was in August or September or something like that.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Because, spoiler alert, the expansions aren't free,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
and that's what they really want you to buy.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
But...

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Joke's on them.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I'm not going to buy them.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
You can still get a pretty decent experience

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
with the free game, and you know, why not?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
If you have a Battle.net account,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
which I imagine most of you do,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
and you don't have to buy a Blizzard game to get one,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
because like you can play the WoW trial,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
the World of Warcraft trial.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Well, and Hearthstone is free, actually,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
now that I think about it.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
So you could just download it to play Hearthstone,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
and you're set.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
You can grab your free copy of Destiny 2,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
but only until November.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
The 18th.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
So again, about two weeks from tonight.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
So go get it.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Go do that.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Even if you're not sure if you want to play it,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
it's always good just to put it in your library.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
That's right.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
It's not free until November 18th

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
when they're going to pull it off your account,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
but register it now.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
It's free forever, basically,

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
because the real trick is they want you to buy the expansions.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
That's why they're doing this.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Don't kid yourself.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Yeah, DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
once you get Destiny 2, please pick up Forsaken 2.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
vidpower points out you do need Blizzard SMS

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
on your Battle.net account to get your free Destiny 2 game,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
so they do want you to have the two-factor authentication,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
which, I mean, say what you will about that

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
and maybe giving Blizzard your phone number,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
but in this day and age, you guys,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I don't know about you,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I have two-factor authentication

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
on everything that will let me.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Everything that will let me.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It's just that kind of world that we live in

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
when who's going to get hacked next?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
And especially after having my Xbox 360 account

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
hacked some time ago,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I don't know, it was probably like 10 years ago at this point,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
but still, I don't want that shit to happen again.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
So you better believe I have two-factor authentication

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
on everything.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And I think it's a good idea.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
And then even for my email,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
I will put the two-factor authentication on myself and Alan.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
So even if I ever get locked out or I lose my phone,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
at least Alan can unlock the most important thing,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
that type of thing.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
So anyway, let's see.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Go into chat at live.vognetwork.com.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Bonds006 says,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Not ever going to buy any expansion.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Well, only the Warcraft 3 expansion, Frozen Throne.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
How do you feel, though,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
when the expansions are finally bundled in with the main game?

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Because, for example, if you get Diablo 3 on Switch,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
people forget there was an expansion

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
that really made that game a lot better.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I don't even remember the name of it now.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
It's just Diablo 3 as I know it.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I know they had Rise of the Necromancer,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
was what they called when they released the Necromancer,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
although it really wasn't an expansion.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
But, yeah, they released all that,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
and now you just get it all in one.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
So it's not really an expansion,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
because it's the Ultimate Edition or whatever they call it.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Let's see.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
It's just Reaper of Souls. Thank you, Vidpower.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Bobby Blackwolf is saying,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
The Quiet Man is on Steam, which means you can refund it

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
as long as you don't play it for longer than two hours.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Which is how long the game is.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And Shane says,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Why would you put yourself through even five minutes?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Did I make clear how terrible it was?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
If you want to put yourself through 20 minutes,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
like I say, I recommend you go watch Jim Sterling's video on it,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
because it sums up basically all of the key features

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
of why you would not like this game.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I love that Shane is continuing his campaign of hate

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
by joining the chat room to be like,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
He is just doing a public service

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
of keeping people away from shitty games.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
There is no harm in that.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
And I understand that Square Enix is a company

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
that I like as well, but you know what?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000
When they make a crappy game that's not Chocobo Racing,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
then I'm going to call them out on that crap.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I love Chocobo Racing.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Exactly. They could have used the resources

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
put towards this.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
We could have had a whole new Imogen Heat song

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
for Chocobo Racing.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Crazy Chocobo by Imogen Heat.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
But no, instead we get the Quiet Man.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
It's a crime, I tell you.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I'm just imagining Imogen Heat singing a bunch of lyrics

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
that go like, Work, work, work, quack, work, work, quack.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And it sadly makes sense.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
So them doing the whole, you know,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
just like the Chocobo theme,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
but with that auto-tune.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Yes. That. Exactly that.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
There was another big announcement this week

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
around Super Smash Bros.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
That's right, there was a big direct,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Direct

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
that happened earlier this week,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
and lots of things were unveiled.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
And the earlier rumors,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
remember that really convincing rumor,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
the Grinch rumor in that whole thing?

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
No, that was not convincing. It's from 4chan.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Turned out to be fake.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Oh, what a fake rumor from 4chan?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
That is so unreal.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Anyway, the one part that was real

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
was like the even odds bet part

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
that Ken is going to be...

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Oh, there's already a leaked screenshot of Ken.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Everybody knew Ken was coming, come on.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
They will be continuing to release new amiibo

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
throughout 2019.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
So with all these new characters

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
that are coming to the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
there will be new amiibo,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
including Isabel, Pichu, Ken,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Young Link, Daisy,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
all of the new amiibo coming in through 2019.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Apparently there will be a snake amiibo at some point.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
King K. Rool and Ice Climbers

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
are going to be out on February 15th, 2019.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Wolf and Ridley and Inkling

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
will be the launch day amiibos.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
The question is, are they still patching it?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Well, I don't think they are in the Wii U anymore.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Are they patching in those new amiibos

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
to work with Mario Maker?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I think Mario Maker is kind of done, Loki.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I hate to say it.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I kind of wish they would bring it back.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I'm surprised they have a remaster of that.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I wish they would bring it back for Switch,

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
but maybe that will be a thing they do next year.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Anyway, no trophies.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
That whole trophy thing is going to be gone

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
in Super Smash Ultimate.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
What they are doing instead,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
it is a spirit system.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Not everybody I think is feeling this,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
but that's what it is.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
You will be able to fill your player with spirits,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
like an augment.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
You can do primary and support spirits,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
but you will not have the characters.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
You will win them in spirit battles.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I guess the aura of characters

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
that were not included in the game,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
like Astro Man from Mega Man 9

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
and Chibi-Robo,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
you can also do these with multiplayer mode.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
For example, if you fight a giant Mega Man

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
in the Guts Man stage,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
you might get the Guts Man spirit.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
That's something you can use to augment your character

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
a little later on.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Because they've killed everyone.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Apparently, you can feed and upgrade.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
You level up, you do missions.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
One way I've heard this referred to negatively

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
is it's kind of like a mobile phone.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
What do they call it?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Gotcha type of game.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Even though that might be a big deal in Japan,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
they're not nearly quite as popular here.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I don't think everybody is really excited about that.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Anyway, vidpower in chat says,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
poor Sakurai, he'll be working on Smash stuff forever.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
One of my favorite memes right now

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
is that picture of Sakurai

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
just looking dead-ass tired that says,

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
he's never asked me for anything ever again.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Also, they announced that Piranha Plant

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
will be the first DLC fighter.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
So Piranha Plant will be coming to the game.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
That is, I think, a free DLC character, actually.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
If you buy the game before January something.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Oh, that's right. You have to buy it before a certain day.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
So it's kind of like a launch window type of free thing

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
that you can grab there.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
You can also get a Piranha Plant amiibo

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
with all those other things I was talking about.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
People are very excited about this.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
The final Smash will be Petey Piranha.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
So that's from Mario Galaxy,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
is where that reference comes from.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
So yay that they're still referencing that, I suppose.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
And then, didn't they announce one more fighter too?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Oh yes, Incineroar was also announced

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
as a playable fighter in the game.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Which, you know, another Pokemon fighter.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
But it's kind of like a wrestling Pokemon.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Incineroar really looks like a wrestler.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
So I guess there's a lot they can kind of do with that.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
So they can make it, you know.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Is Incineroar in the Pokemon fighting game?

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
No, I don't believe so.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Because Incineroar, if I remember right,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
comes from Pokemon, the newest one.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Pokemon Sun and Moon.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Because he is Litten's final form.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
So he comes from the newest one.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I think Pokken is before Gen 7.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
I think. Don't quote me.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I'm sure I'll get corrected in chat momentarily if I'm wrong.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Shane in chat says,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Piranha Plant is not a part of the five upcoming DLC fighters.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Which is good.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Oh, but Shane does point out.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
DeSuidae is in Pokken.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And that is Gen 7. So I was wrong on that.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
DeSuidae is Rowlet's final form.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
So I forgot about that. So fair enough.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Let's see.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
There's going to be a fighter's pass

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
to support all these DLC characters.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
It comes not just with a DLC character, but there will be a stage

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
and all that good stuff.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Yeah, so there will be a World of Light adventure mode.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Subspace Emissary is not coming back.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
But the World of Light adventure mode kind of looks fun.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Although obviously they're keeping a lot of it a secret.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Because they don't want people to ruin it all.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Apparently Kirby is going to play a big role in that.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Which I'm sure made Act Deft very happy to hear.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
So, lots of news coming out about Smash.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
What do you think? Where's your head at with Smash?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I mean, the reality is,

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
the minute they announced they were doing a Smash Bros. for Switch,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I'm getting it. Why wouldn't I get it?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Like, it kind of doesn't matter what's announced and all this stuff.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I don't want to make it sound like I'm not hyped or anything like that.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
But I just, you know, I just think

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
the game is going to be great. It's a Smash game.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
What are the chances you think Waluigi is going to be a DLC character?

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Never say never.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
But I just, I don't know.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It would be funny if it was the very last one they do.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
But I don't know, guys.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I think the internet, sometimes the internet shouldn't get everything at once.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Let's just leave it at that.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Kaijuto says,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
They better not make another Smash after this one.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
This is the ultimate. Just put it on every system here on out.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
S2100Matt says,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Sakurai is going to hide deep in the woods after this one.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
You know what? Honestly, after this,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Sakurai should be able to make whatever fucking game he wants.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
If he has like a pet project that, you know what?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
He should be able to make whatever fucking game he wants

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
after doing this for Nintendo for so long.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
And as far as Smash Bros. goes,

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
you can wait a little while for another one.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Or maybe it'll just get turned over to other people.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Not that I'm saying Sakurai really shouldn't stay a part of it,

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
but if Sakurai wants to do some other stuff,

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
fucking let him. Jesus.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
First off, let him take a nap.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
That's the first thing he should do,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
is get to take a nap.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Anyway, let's move on.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
We have plenty more news to get to. Loki.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
So there was a new Undertale type game that was released.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
So, Deltarune, which was a prequel to Undertale.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
And, or, I don't know if it was a prequel, a sequel,

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
but it's related to Undertale.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And I guess they had this survey that went out, as well,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
that allowed you to actually download the game for free,

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
if I remember correctly.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
So it's pretty cool.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
And then, I don't know.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.000
It's a neat looking game, but...

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I still haven't played Undertale yet.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
But, I hear this one's pretty cool,

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
and it has a lot of people wondering, you know,

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
what the secrets are behind it.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
So mysterious.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Is this one of those things where, like,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
it's gonna be like an onion,

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
where many layers start unveiling themselves,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
and how it ties into other stuff, and, I don't know,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
like a whole, like, Five Nights type story going on here?

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Sort of, but, like, they have, what's kind of cool about it is,

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000
like, they have a similar combat system in the game,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
but you can actually have parties,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
instead of just, like, your single character.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I don't know.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
It looked pretty cool from the video that I saw, but...

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Some comments from chat, over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Rama says,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Deltarune is an anagram for Undertale.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
So, interesting. Fun fact.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
And then, Dark Tetsuya, I'm sorry,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
it's actually s200mata saying, Loki, play Undertale.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And stream it, also.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I have, I have it.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I just haven't played it yet.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
But I have it.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Story of my life.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
It's in my Steam collection.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Exactly. It's in my Steam library.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Just haven't gotten around to playing it yet.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Alright, well, something that's possibly going to be added to your Switch library soon is the YouTube app.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Lots of rumors that the YouTube app is finally going to happen on Nintendo Switch,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
so that could be interesting.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.000
This is due to the fact that the official Nintendo site put up a placeholder for YouTube on the Nintendo Switch.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
So, apparently, it will be coming to the system on the 8th of November.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Now, there hasn't been any confirmation from Nintendo or YouTube on this,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
but, I mean, why not, right?

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
So, that would be this week.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Yeah.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Getting right into the holiday season.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Putting Netflix on it while they're at it.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I know, right?

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
But, for whatever reason, that isn't on the agenda yet.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
But, YouTube, you know, like, you would use that, right?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Because your kids love YouTube, don't they?

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Yeah, probably not necessarily on the, um, on the Switch,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
but, yeah, I mean, I would, I would see some use out of it.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Alright.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Well, let's move on.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000
One other game that I should be excited about, but I, unfortunately, am not excited about.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
That's Fallout 76.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
So, Fallout 76, if you had pre-ordered it, you get the wonderful beta tests that you get to participate in.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
So, with that, um, there's been some hitches with the beta, after all.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:35.000
So, one of the first problems is there's a bug in the beta that actually re-downloads the beta.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
So, as you're, you know, trying to launch the game or whatever,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000
um, it unfortunately causes the client to delete itself and re-download itself.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
All 50 gigs of it.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Sounds like, um, an issue you might have had, you know, but not necessarily with this game, but, like, similar to...

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.000
When Quantum Break's patching thing on the Xbox One caused me to hit my Comcast data cap for the first time.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000
But, yeah, the minute you said that, like, re-downloading 50 gigs, like, if that happens 20 times, you're at your cap.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I mean, honestly, since you've already, you've probably used three or four hundred, you know, megabytes in a month like I do, you got less than that.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Yeah, so, like, apparently there was an issue where, like, it would freeze up and then it would just force you to re-download the whole thing.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
So, that kind of sucks.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Um, but apparently, um, I guess they're working on maybe fixing it. I don't know.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Um, and then on top of that, a little bit more major bug, though, in actual gameplay and how the game is designed.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Apparently, people have found that the physics in the game are tied to the framerate that you're running the game at.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:44.000
So, for example, if you have a better system or you're, you know, find a way that you can run the game at a higher framerate,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:53.000
and you can actually unlock the framerate using a small edit to an .ini file, um, if you're able to run the game at a higher framerate,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:59.000
you will move faster than other players, or you will shoot faster than other players.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:06.000
So, for example, people have been looking at the ground a little bit to help, you know, cause the framerate to go up,

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
and they're able to run faster than people, um, that are on lower spec computers.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Hmm.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
That is stupid. You should never do that.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Yeah, that sounds like a problem.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
That is, like, amateur hour bullshit.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:25.000
DungeonBuster in chat says, well, Bethesda did say to prepare for spectacular bugs with Fallout 76.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
It is a beta, right?

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
You can't advertise that as a feature, Bethesda.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Bugs are not a feature.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I mean, some of them can be, like, quaint in, like, Skyrim stuff.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Seriously, that is, that is some broken shit right there.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Like, I don't know what modern game nowadays would even do that.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Like, you always check the, you know, like, for example, in Unity, you would use a delta time,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:59.000
so that you were always getting a consistent, um, clock tick on your, you know, physics calculations or whatever,

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000
because you're able to see, oh, this frame came sooner than this last frame.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:12.000
It's always kind of, you know, giving you a multiplier to speed and slow down everything based on whatever delay there is in your framerate.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
But to just lock it to that framerate is dumb.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000
That's why, like, in some of these older games, like, that are, I can't think of anything in particular,

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:26.000
but there's, like, some older games, like, if you try to emulate them or you try to run them on a faster PC,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
it just fucks everything up, because, like, a game that was locked through a 30 FPS,

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.000
well, the physics are all based on the 30 FPS, and so when you unlock at the 60, everything goes all fucked up.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:43.000
And apparently this, from what I hear, was an issue tied to Gamebryo, which was, like, one of their engines that they were running back with Morrowind,

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:50.000
but they incorporated some of that stuff into the creation engine when they were doing, you know, Skyrim and Fallout and all that stuff,

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000
and they just, I guess they kept dealing, I don't know why they would do that. It's just really dumb.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Is it something that seems like it'll be fixable before the main game releases, though?

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I don't think they can fix it.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Oh, God. Interesting.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Interesting.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I mean, it would be a major overhaul, I think.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000
So, consoles are going to be the way to do it, because consoles, at least, are all kind of, like, the same baseline.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:19.000
They're going to be locked to, they would be able to lock the framerate, but PC, since you have that stuff exposed in an INI file, it's dumb.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Oh, boy.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, hey, let's attack this guy's camp. Other guy moves as fast as the flash and kills everyone.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Oh, never mind.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
That sounds a little game-breaking.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Like, it wouldn't be so bad if it was, like, a single-player game, but being that it's online multiplayer, eh, not great.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Well, if you want to play a single-player game that's only-

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Oh, and I did want to mention, just in case there was any question, Bethesda says there were the issue, and it says a fix won't be out until the game launches.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
So, they're going to try to work it out before the game launches, I guess.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Yes.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Interesting.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000
All right, well, if you do want to play a single-player only game, then one of those games you can play is Tetris Effect.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:08.000
That's right, because Tetris Effect will not have competitive multiplayer, which is something that many people, I think, associate with Tetris, especially thanks to things like Tetranet or the original Game Boy Tetris.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Yeah, but this is a little bit more chill, so I can kind of see how it would-

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I think that's exactly why they did this.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:26.000
You know, Mizuguchi talks about how Tetris Effect is really kind of to get in the zone, which is why you have that zone mechanic, and it's really, you know, what they're doing is really all about that.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000
And a representative from Enhanced Games kind of, you know, expanded on this, named Mark McDonald, saying,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
There's no direct head-to-head multiplayer because we don't want something that's going to stress people out.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
People would find a way to spell fuck you in Tetris pieces or something.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Well, he's not wrong.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I think it'd be easier for them to draw a dick.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Yeah, that's true. Anyway.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
We just want to make it into a positive thing where you see your friends playing well.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:04.000
And so I guess they do like, you know, there's Learboards, asynchronous multiplayer, the whole, you know, they did that weekend ritual during the test this weekend where everybody was working towards a common goal, which they hit before I could even log into the game.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
I mean, they hit it fast.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.000
But apparently, like, you know, you can do things where you're working together to meet a goal and maybe unlock a new avatar or something like that.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000
So that's the type of stuff they want to do for multiplayer.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:22.000
But none of this, you know, versus stuff, which is interesting because if you played that mystery mode, which was kind of hidden in the demo.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:29.000
And by the time most of you hear this, if you're not live, you know, the Tetris Effect demo is probably already done because it was a weekend demo.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
And once they pull it, they pull it.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
And even if you downloaded it, you can't play anymore.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.000
But with the demo, they had the mystery mode in it, and it had all these ways to fuck with your pieces.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Like, it wasn't just pushing it up. It was about, like, they would spin rows. You would have a giant piece.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000
My favorite one was the one for a minute where you would get only three.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Like, instead of it four block pieces, you got three block pieces.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:01.000
And it was actually kind of like a reward, I think, because you could put them into some harder to reach places and help to clear your board a little bit from some of the other ways that it would fuck with you.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:10.000
And then the one that completely got me, and if you watch on stream, I know I had a hilarious reaction, was when all of a sudden the entire image flipped upside down.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
And you just have to play the game upside down.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.000
And it really, like, you know, left is right, right is left, and it just, like, completely fucks with you.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
So, you know, because you're in the zone, that was a little rough.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.000
So, I mean, it has kind of that same intensity that multiplayer would have a little bit, I think.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
But, you know, for whatever reason, they decided not to put it in the game.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
And it's fine. It really sounds like there's going to be a lot of stuff to enjoy in this game.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
And I guess they're wanting to save something for the sequel, aren't they?

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Sure.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Or maybe they don't want to step on the toes too hard with Puyo Puyo Tetris.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Because if you want, you can play a purely competitive Tetris.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000
You don't even have to have the Puyo stuff in it. You can just play Tetris on the Puyo Puyo Tetris.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
So maybe that kind of went into it. I don't know.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
But anyway, that's actually not the only game that's not going to have multiplayer.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Sorta.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000
This one's kind of surprising.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Civilization VI, as we know, is coming to the Nintendo Switch.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
It's not going to have online multiplayer.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Right?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Right? Now, it has local multiplayer.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
You can play locally, but it will not have online.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Which is something we've kind of gotten used to having in Civilization games ever since.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Like, I think even the second one had it built in.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
I know the first one had Civ Net, which was a re-release of the first one just so you could play online.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
But yeah, online Civilization play has always been a thing.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
So it's a little weird that it's not in the Switch version.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
But apparently a Reddit user spotted something kind of weird with the eShop

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
that talked about how you can play over local wireless.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
And it didn't talk about anything online.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
They say, a 2K spokesperson said via email,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Civilization VI for Nintendo Switch includes support for local cooperative and competitive multiplayer

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
for up to four players via a wireless network.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
It will not have online multiplayer.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
That's weird.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Yeah.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Do they not want to run the servers for it or something?

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
It's got to be something along those lines. I don't know.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Especially when you consider, when did they unveil Civilization VI?

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Is it going to have, like, local multiplayer?

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Yes, I just said. It's going to have plenty of the local.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
So you can do that.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
That's a long time, though, playing Civ. I mean, I don't know.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Honestly, the LAN local...

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Are we not trying to sell this online thing that they have?

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
I mean, because...

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
That's what I was just saying.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
When did they announce Civilization VI?

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Do you remember, Loki?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
What Nintendo Direct did they announce Civilization VI in?

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
During the multiplayer thing?

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
During the online presentation.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.000
That's kind of weird.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Right?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
That's the weird part to me.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Did they go back on it and change their mind?

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I don't know. I don't know.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000
So what features are you providing us, Nintendo, with our online features?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
What?

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
We have free Nintendo games.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Start to See You in Chat says, that's an important distinction.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Civ VI does have local multiplayer, though no online is a little weird.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I mean, why not something like the play-by-email model, where you can take your turn whenever?

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Oh, God, I forgot that was a thing.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
In one of the Civ games, I think it was Civ IV, you could play by email.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000
So you would email your move, and then somebody would open it up, take their move, email it back,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
and that's how you would play.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Like, it would take you a fucking year to get through a game of Civilization that way.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000
I mean, I have... I seem to remember this was a thing.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Am I crazy, you guys, or was this a thing?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000
That, like, board game enthusiasts would set up an entire board game, like, in their living room,

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
and people would play via postcard.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Like, they would email their... or they would write it on postcard and send it and play by mail.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Like, that was a thing that people used to do.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Used to see that in the back of, like, these tabletop books or, like, magazines or...

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
So, like, I'm not crazy. That used to be a thing.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
So, Civilization IV, I think it was IV. I'm sorry if I got the wrong version.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000
But it had something similar, but it was email. You played by email.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Kind of a fun little throwback to that, those sort of days.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000
So, Izet in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
My dad did that with war games. VidPower says, mail chess.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
That's right, chess was a big thing for that.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Yeah, but unfortunately you can't do that with email and the Switch, because there's no email.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Yeah, I know, there's no email on the Switch. I know, I know.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
But it's a cute idea.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I guess you could tie it with your phone app, because, hey, don't you all have phones?

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
What?

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
You asshole, that is so funny. All right.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Way to bring it full circle, Logie. All right.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
We do have that wonderful phone app that...

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
No, I know, I know.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
You know what? No, we shouldn't be inventing other ways that Civ can be online.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
They should just have the fucking online mobile.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Maybe just tunnel it. People will just find a way to tunnel it.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Dungeon Buster says,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Online's not a huge thing with me for Civ games either, but it's unusual in mission.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Omission, excuse me.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Bobby Blackwell says,

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
The tagline for this episode is, Don't you all have phones?

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:56.000
You know what, though, to be fair, we don't put show quotes in our title.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
That just never took off for this show, because we're too old, I guess.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000
But I bet those shows out there that do name their shows,

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
I bet you that title's going to show up a lot.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Because, you know, what do you mean you can't listen to this podcast?

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Don't you all have phones?

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
All right, anyway.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Let's, you know what, let's go back to a simpler time when, no,

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
not everybody had phones.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Although, actually, I think with this particular game of the week,

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
you did have phones, but it was like the very first iPhone.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000
It was the very first one.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
You had flip phones.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Or flip phones. Is that like my old, that old thing I used to,

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
you remember my flip phone I had when we lived together?

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
It was like, ooh, this thing takes pictures,

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000
and it was like 64 by 64, like little pixel-sized things.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
It was like grainy as fuck.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Anyway, we're going to take a trip down memory lane

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
with the classic game of the week.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
And so we're going to take a step back,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
and face, and time, and magic, and all that stuff,

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
and visit with Dark Sakura, thanks to Skype,

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
for our classic game of the week.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
You there, Jamie?

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I am.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Hi, Jamie, how are you?

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I'm doing okay.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
All right.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Lazy day.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Yeah, lazy day. It's been a lazy weekend.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
But, you know, after Halloween, you expect, you know,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
you need a little recovery time.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Because I don't know about you, but my Halloween was crazy.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Yeah, mine was, actually I spent it at work,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000
but it was still pretty fun.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Yeah, well, hey, that's a little crazy too.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Crazy money.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
You're making some crazy money.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Yeah, really.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Oops, the wrong classic game of the week.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
and find one game that she thinks,

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
hey, you brats should be paying attention to this game.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
But in a little twist on the year, once a month,

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
she chooses a peripheral instead.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000
So I believe tonight we have a classic peripheral of the month

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
for the month of November.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Am I right?

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Yes, you are correct.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I have chosen as our peripheral the Wii Balance Board,

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
or as it was called in Japan, Balenzu Wiibodou.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
All right.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.000
And the music tonight is actually coming from Wii Fit U,

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000
because I had a really hard time finding the original Wii Fit,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
like play stuff on YouTube.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000
It felt good.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Yeah.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Peripherals, no, no generation.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Exactly.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Well, and let's be real.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Wii Fit U is really just kind of like a cash in

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
to try to get people to come over to the Wii U.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Pretty much.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Anyway, the Wii Balance Board first came out in Japan

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
on December 10th, 2007,

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
in Europe on April 26th, 2008,

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Australia May 8th, 2008,

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
and North America on May 19th, 2008.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000
And then in Korea in December 2008.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
So it does actually fall under a 10-year range thing

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000
for classic stuff,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.000
but peripherals, like I said, no, no generation.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Well, no, it was a May...

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Yeah, no, we're past May 2018,

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
so it's been over 10 years.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Right.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Well, anyway, it is shaped kind of like a scale,

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
like a full-body scale.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
It's plain white and gray.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
It runs on four AA batteries,

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
and it can power for about 60 hours.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
It does use Bluetooth to connect,

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
and has four pressure sensors

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
to measure your center of balance.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
So that's where it gets the control from,

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.000
is being a center of balance alignment tool.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
It can...

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
It actually has been flaunted

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
that it can measure weight

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
better than the traditional bathroom scale.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I mean, it's designed to support,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
for the Japanese one, up to 300 pounds,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
and the Western version up to 330 pounds,

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
even though they are technically still the same device.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
They had to let us have a little more weight here.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Huh?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I said they had to let us have a little more weight here.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Well, it really is still the same one.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
It just has to do with the device calibration.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Ah.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
But it actually has been compared to the Joy Board

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
that came out of the Atari VCS 1982.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000
But, of course, you know, the Wii Balance Board

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
is quite a bit more, I'd say, advanced.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
And so, basically,

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
you can actually get Wii Fit non-skid socks

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
that were provided to members of Club Nintendo.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I know people who used the socks that were given

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
at Kaiser whenever they had surgery.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Hmm.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000
They pretty much, you know, just no skid hospital socks.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000
At any rate, there are a few games

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
that will support the balance board,

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
of course Wii Fit being the main one.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
It was actually said that, you know,

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
there were lots of third-party inquiries,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
you know, after it was announced.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
But they were also saying that

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
the most straightforward game to come out for it

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
would be some kind of snowboarding game.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
And so Wii Ski by Bondi Namco

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
was the first third-party game to make use of the balance board.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000
And it would also use the remote and nunchuck attachment as well.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
As far as games that will support it,

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
there actually are a number of games that will,

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000
including All Star Cheer Squad by THQ,

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
The Biggest Loser,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000
CDR Hottest Party and Music Sit,

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
and CDR Revolution,

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000
although I don't exactly understand how it would accurately use it.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
EA Sports NFL Training Camp,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
The Garfield Show that The Threat of Space was on ya.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
What?

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Gets it with Mel B.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Oh, nice.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Another game by Marvelous Entertainment called Ikenie no Yoru,

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Avatar the Game,

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
quite a few of course fitness games,

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party,

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Punch-Out! used it,

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Super Monkey Ball Step and Roll,

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Tetris Party Deluxe,

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
I'm just picking like some weird ones on here,

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:04.000
and then of course the WiiWare games were using it too.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
So there was that.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.000
But a few other things about it is that it reads the center of pressure.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.000
It actually is a proven tool for assessing center pressure displacement,

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:24.000
so it could be used for different medical conditions to help with balance and treatment thereof.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000
It sold 32 million units worldwide at launch,

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:38.000
and that means that it was awarded a Guinness World Record for best selling personal weighing device.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000
By January 2012, it sold 42 million units.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
And there you go, the Wii Balance Board,

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000
or Banasui Bodo in Japanese.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I never really thought of that,

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000
that like there's so many different types of scales and things that you can buy for your home

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.000
that the Wii Fit Balance Board was so huge that it actually was the most popular scale

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
for people to have in their home in a way.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
It's so weird.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000
That it did.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Video games, their impact, amazing.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Right?

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Yeah.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Well there it is, your classic peripheral of the month, the Wii Fit Balance Board.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
See, I thought this was going to be another thing kind of like when you did Steel Battalion,

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000
how it was kind of like the game and the peripheral kind of go together,

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000
but really not really.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:29.000
I kind of forgot just how big this thing was and how many games all really supported it

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000
because so many people bought Wii Fit.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Well yeah, like there's some other ones, like there was the Champion Jockey game,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000
there was Dream Dance and Cheer, Don King Boxing.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000
So a lot of those, I mean we know that the Wii ended up being like,

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I don't want to say necessarily like a shovel ground for those fitness games, but kinda.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
You know what I mean?

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Yeah, but I mean, and I'm looking at just the list of non-fitness-y games.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Like I said, there was Rayman in there.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Yeah.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
There was, well Mario and Sonic used it.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Yeah.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Let's play Ballerina.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Okay Jamie, when will we play Ballerina?

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
That's something that was definitely an evaluage.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Yeah, no, I think it's cool.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.000
We kind of forget a little bit just how versatile this was, you know,

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:24.000
and it was a Nintendo peripheral that really took off in the way that not every peripheral necessarily does.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Like, you know, a DDR dance mat wasn't probably used in that many games.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I know it ended up being in a few things besides just DDR, but it wasn't like that many.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000
You know, Guitar Hero, Guitar Controller doesn't get used in that many other games,

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
although there was a couple here and there, you know what I mean?

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.000
It's just the balance board is just so big and hugely adopted,

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:47.000
and ten years old now, which, you know, means everybody out there listening.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
You know what that means?

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
You're old too.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Alright, well Jamie, sad to not have you in studio again this week,

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000
but I hope everything's going good with work, and I know we'll get you back in here soon,

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
but anything else we need to talk about during your week before we head back to the main show?

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I've started playing Magikarp Jump.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Oh God, you were telling me about how you're addicted to that on the phone, right?

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
It's so stupid, and it's really cute.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Hey, what do you think about this?

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Because I know this is a controversy we're going to tackle tonight on the show,

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000
and I definitely would welcome your opinion because I know you're a fan of many Blizzard products,

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
having played things like World of Warcraft and so forth over the years,

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:33.000
but, you know, a really negative reception happening to the Diablo mobile game announcement.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000
How do you feel about Diablo going mobile?

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I'll be honest, I didn't even know it was happening until you just now said it.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Yeah, it was...

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
That's how out of Diablo I am.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Yeah, it was kind of their big announcement.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
It was the very end.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I mean, which is interesting because they announced a Warcraft 3 remaster,

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000
and I've got to be careful because I don't want to repeat what I'm going to say during the live show,

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000
but, you know, this was like the big tent pole they saved for the end was Diablo Immortal,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000
their cell phone game, and a lot of people, like even at BlizzCon,

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.000
somebody asked a question in one of those Q&A panels.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000
It was like, is this an April Fool's joke, which I kind of cringed a little bit

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
because I was like, wow, that's like super disrespectful,

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000
but it also kind of shows like the fan base is like really mad, yo.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Mm-mm.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Yeah.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
All right.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Well, you know, I think having a mobile Diablo, though,

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.000
really isn't so much of a bad thing because it definitely expands the user base

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.000
and it would definitely, I don't know,

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:40.000
it sounds like it would actually be fairly good to have on a phone.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I mean, it sounds like it would be fun.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
It's kind of a little bit where my head's at.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Like they could have announced it in a much better way,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000
but I think at the end of the day, all of these haters are going to try it.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
It's going to be free.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Like I kind of think y'all are kidding yourselves

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
if you're not going to at least download it.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
No, I'd probably give it a shot.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
We'll see.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
But actually, I kind of want to start playing WoW again.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000
I've been paying for it.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I may as well, you know, play it.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Good idea.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000
All right.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Well, Jamie, we're going to get back to the main show.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight before we head back?

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Vote and don't vote stupidly.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Don't vote a party ticket.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Read everything and vote after lots of research.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
That's all I have to say.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Voting is important, y'all.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Don't forget about it.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Those of you that are in the U.S., voting day is Tuesday,

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
and hopefully y'all registered to vote already.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000
But many states do allow you to register the day of

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
if for whatever reason you missed it.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Just don't forget to vote, you know, as Jamie said there.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Educate yourself on the issues and vote accordingly.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Please, please.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Anyway, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio,

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
our 751st show already in progress.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
We've had a fun show so far talking about all this stuff.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
We had Shane on talking about The Quiet Man,

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
which was a fun conversation.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000
We were also talking about Diablo Immortal,

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000
which I was also, you know, pinging Jamie about a little bit there

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
at the end of that segment.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000
But while we were away in Radio Magic land,

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000
you were looking up what, memes about Diablo?

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
I was just looking up, reading Reddit,

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
but, like, there's several memes already,

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
just with the whole online thing.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
So, like, they have one with Sakurai.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
You know, it's clearly from the Smash Direct.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
It's like, some of you might be upset

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000
over the lack of basic online functionality built into the Switch,

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
and then you see him just kind of sigh,

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
and then it shows the phones up.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Do you guys not have phones?

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Great, great.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000
When you managed to slam two companies in your meme,

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000
that's pretty impressive.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
And, you know, while we were doing the first segment there,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
one of my Ingress buddies, who I think is actually listening,

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.000
is that, actually sent me a picture, I guess, that was taken at BlizzCon.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
This isn't really a meme, but it's like a BlizzCon picture

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
of, like, basically nobody playing Diablo Immortal.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
But I was looking in the background, I'm like,

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
okay, well, nobody's there.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Like, they took this after closing or something.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Like, you can see, there's nobody in the background either.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I'm like, I don't think it's just that booth.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
But apparently, it was pulled from Reddit,

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.000
and it actually says that it was during the concert,

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
but there was nobody at Diablo Mobile,

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
and some of the others had, like, 10 to 20.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000
There were some other lines that did have people in it.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000
You just can't see it in the picture.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
But it was during the concert, so a little bit of in-between.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:23.000
But apparently, not a lot of people in line to play Diablo Immortal at that point.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
So, something that I'm sure Blizzard is noticing too.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:33.000
So, apparently, I know when I've gone to conventions before,

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
they click how many people come through the line.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Like, I'm almost positive the Final Fantasy Fan Fest is one of these.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
They'll have a clicker when you get to the front of the line and go play.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000
So, they know exactly how many people come through,

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
and they'll be able to report that back.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
And if it seems like the Diablo thing is getting really low engagement

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
for what was supposed to be their tentpole release,

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
again, as I was kind of saying earlier,

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I don't want to revisit this topic completely,

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.000
but I do think Blizzard is going to be like,

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000
okay, again, 8.30 a.m. Monday morning, shut the door.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
What the fuck happened at BlizzCon, everybody?

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
It's going to be a conversation.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.000
We'll have to see what follows up a little later.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
All right, anyway, let's see.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Vidpower in chat says, the time of day matters too.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000
There's a pic floating around with all of the Diablo Immortal stations being played at one point.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Yeah, probably right when it first came out,

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
because I'm sure there's a lot of people like me too.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Like, if you haven't figured it out, I'm very much of this mindset of,

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
I don't hate it.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000
I'm probably not going to play it obsessively,

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
but I'll download it and try it,

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
and I'll be sad that I didn't actually get a Diablo 3 expansion,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
but then I'll remember that Blizzard's just fucking slow,

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
and there'll be a Diablo 4 eventually,

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
and this may or may not really be for me,

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
but I'm kidding myself if I'm sitting here going,

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I play a shit ton of mobile games.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
I play Pokemon Go, Ingress,

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
The Great League of the Lost,

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
and all this other stuff I was mentioning in the first segment.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Like, of course I'm going to try it.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Could it be that people feel that they're entitled to bigger news

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.000
because they paid $200 or whatever to get into BlizzCon?

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
When it comes to dude who asked,

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
is this an April Fool's joke?

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Absolutely.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Entitlement is, I think, a keyword there.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
It's one that's being flung around on Twitter quite a bit

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.000
with, I think, mixed truth,

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
but, you know, I think entitlement's sure.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Like I said, that guy who asked that question,

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
you paid $200 to be there.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Congrats, kid. You played yourself.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Blizzard got your money, and they don't even want money

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
for Diablo Immortal to download.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Let's not.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Yeah, they don't want money to install it on your system,

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
but, oh, they want your money.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
I know.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
They want all of your money.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000
They want your money, but I think a big meeting's going to happen Monday,

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000
and we'll see.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Anyway, I don't want to rehash part A.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
We've got to get into some more news here in part B.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
If you want to rehash it, though,

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
we will welcome your phone calls on all these subjects later.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Be sure to add us on Skype if you haven't already.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Somebody was trying to get through last week and couldn't.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
It's because I hadn't seen their request and accepted it,

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
so you do have to, like, add us on Skype.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000
I think that helps you get through.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I may have locked that down because of spammers some time ago,

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
because I don't know if you guys remember,

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
we used to get, like, full-on, like, faxes, phone calls,

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
so I think you have to be on our contact list to call us.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
No, seeing as spammers, like, I hadn't checked my PlayStation messages

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.000
for a long time, and there were so many, like, bots.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Change your privacy settings so that only, like,

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
friends of friends can message you.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000
It'll help a lot.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Yeah, it's just like, delete, delete, delete, delete.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Yeah, that's irritating.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Totally irritating.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000
All right, let's move on.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Rapid Fire News.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000
What else do we have, Loki?

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
So there's a pretty good chance that Sunset Overdrive is heading to PC.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:42.000
This is because the Korean's rating board listed a PC port of the version of the game.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Of course, also the ESRB has also added a listing for the PC version of the game as well,

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000
so perhaps we'll be getting a PC port soon,

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000
and maybe they'll be part of that whole, you know, expanded Game Pass service.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:02.000
I would definitely pick it up on PC, because I wanted to play the game on Xbox One,

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
but I don't have an Xbox One, so, you know.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.000
I grabbed it on that lovely Games with Gold thing,

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000
so I can play it on Xbox One eventually.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Yeah.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:18.000
And then, of course, for the month of November, we have our free games now,

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.000
so for PlayStation, we had originally kind of talked about rumor,

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.000
because they had leaked it out a little bit,

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
but all of those rumored games are coming out,

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:30.000
so Bulletstorm Full Clip Edition and Yakuza Kiwami on PlayStation 4,

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.000
the Jackbox Party Pack 2 and Arkido series on PlayStation 3,

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
and then the Vita games, which are also crossed by PlayStation 4,

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Burly Man at Sea and Roundabout.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
I already have Roundabout.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Oh, I did buy that game, though.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
So that's going to be coming out as well in November.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:53.000
And then on the Xbox side of things, we've got Battlefield 1,

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000
which is pretty awesome.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.000
That's going to be out for the month of November,

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.000
and then Race the Sun from the second half of November to the middle of December,

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
and then your Xbox 360 compatible titles,

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Assassin's Creed for the first half of November,

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000
and Dante's Inferno for the second half of November.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Pretty solid lineup.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Yeah.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000
I want to check out the Dante's Inferno,

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
because I never did when it was originally out.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
I'd rather have Battlefield 1 than...

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Yeah, but you know I'm not a big Battlefield War game type of guy,

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000
but I guess when it's free, it's hard to complain.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Yeah.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Bonz006 says, Bulletstorm, I must say, I like that game.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Yeah.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Are the PS Plus stuff already gone live, or is that this next week?

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
I think it's this next week. It was delayed.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000
The ones that are up now are definitely worth grabbing,

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
because they have the Tron-looking game is up there now,

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
and what, Friday the 13th, I think?

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Friday the 13th.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Yeah, so I remember triggering something else on there, too.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
There's a lot of good stuff right now, so kind of a reminder to you.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
I know this week, yeah, they should be switching them over this week,

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.000
so just get a chance to go grab that.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.000
All right, anyhow, we want to get to some more news,

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000
including Castlevania, which some of you are watching on Netflix.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Netflix apparently knocking that out of the park

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
with some of the Halloween programming.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000
I'm seeing nothing but...

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Disclaimer, I haven't watched any of this myself.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000
I've only heard of it through other people,

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
but apparently the Haunting of Hill House show is phenomenal.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Yeah, my wife said it was too scary to watch,

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000
so she's not watching it.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Oh, boy, okay.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
I was like, well, now I kind of want to see it, but...

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Now you want to watch it.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
I hear Sabrina's great.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
The Reimagining of Sabrina is really good.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
That's the one I really want to see,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
because I actually liked Riverdale.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
And then apparently Castlevania is also really good,

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
and apparently in this season,

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000
they actually incorporate Bloody Tears in some of the music.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Yeah, I still haven't seen the first season yet.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I need to watch it, but...

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Well, you're going to have to catch up,

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
because not only do you need to watch season two now,

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
but there is going to be a season three.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000
That's right, Netflix did confirm Castlevania will be back

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000
for a third season.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000
It is going to be loosely...

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000
I guess the whole series is based on Castlevania III,

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Dracula's Curse,

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
but the anime's been pretty well received.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Apparently the writing is really good,

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
and the same writer's going to be coming back

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
for the third season to continue as a writer

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
and executive producer.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Apparently rumors that...

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Big rumors that one of the show's executive producers,

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
apparently Adi Shankar,

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.000
may be doing a Zelda thing.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Haven't heard a lot more than that than just rumors,

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
but I think that would be really interesting.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Also, speaking of people wanting to do things,

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
this didn't really make our show roll tonight,

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
but did you see that whole tweet where Brie Larson,

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
who's Captain Marvel, right?

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.000
She's a Sacramento local, someone from our town.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Brie Larson wore that Zero Suit Samus outfit for Halloween,

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
and somebody kind of asked her about a Metroid movie,

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
and I'm paraphrasing, but she basically said,

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000
let's make it happen.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000
I would love to do it.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Yeah, they said that this is going to be the closest

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000
we're going to get to a live action Metroid movie,

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000
and she's like, I hope not,

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000
because I would love to play that character.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
And Brie Larson as Samus?

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
I'm good with that.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I'd like to see that, yeah.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000
I've been a fan of hers ever since Scott Pilgrim.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Oh yeah, she was in that.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Yeah, all those Scott Pilgrim throwaway roles

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000
and people in them, they're all huge now.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
It's kind of something else. It's weird.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
That movie, by the way, is also on Netflix now.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Is it?

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
If I saw that, I'd be like, oh, I want to watch that again.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Because you guys know on the side,

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
I do cult cinema hosting, right?

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
I've done Rocky Horror for years,

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000
and I sometimes will do Repo, the genetic opera, Clue.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I've done a basic cult cinema hosting over the years.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I had a lot of fun when we did a doubleheader.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
We did Kung Fury, whichever you're excited about.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Yeah, I'm sad that I missed that.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Yeah, because we had Thor there in person.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000
That would have been awesome.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Yeah, doing the Q&A with him was fun.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000
But then the second movie we did,

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
we did Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Did everyone throw coins?

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Oh, I wish we thought of that.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000
That's a good idea.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
No, nobody really threw things.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
It wasn't total Rocky Horror.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
But there was something about watching it again

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
on the big screen.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
I don't know if Shane's still in chat,

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000
but I dragged Shane to this.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Shane won't see Rocky Horror,

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
but he went to see this because it was like,

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
okay, that I'd go see.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
And I think he actually had a really good time,

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
and I did too because there was something about watching it

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000
with a group of other people who are just nerds

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
and happy to be there that actually made the movie

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
a lot of fun.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
So I don't know if that movie just came out at a bad time.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.000
It was ahead of its time.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
I don't know what, but that Scott Pilgrim's a lot of fun.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000
It's ahead of its time.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Yeah.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000
It's a great movie.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I love it.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
And Shane gives his raving reveal in our chat saying,

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.000
yeah, I liked it.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Great movie.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
That's five stars from Shane.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Great movie and great game,

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
because they have the pixel art beat-em-up game.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
That was a great game.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
All right, anyway.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Also in rapid fire news,

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000
the story I meant to talk about was the great PT debacle.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Did you hear about this?

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Yeah.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Apparently Konami kills, well, here's the,

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000
apparently the internet rumors started this big thing on Twitter,

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.000
and I admit I bought into it because there were screenshot proof.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.000
So I thought, you know, but I guess it was, anyway,

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
apparently Konami was accused of pulling the kill switch on PT,

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:00.000
basically releasing a tiny little patch that disabled it completely.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.000
So it was a nasty little Halloween trick because a lot of streamers were

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000
getting excited to play PT on Halloween because what a good, you know,

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.000
it was a great scary game, but apparently through some follow-up and such,

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
a lot of people are saying, I never got that patch.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
I didn't get that patch.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
It doesn't look like that patch actually exists.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:21.000
So either one person only got that patch or they made up a nasty little

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Halloween trick themselves.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000
They made up a nasty little...

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Now before we all talk about how we should apologize profusely to

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Konami, here's the thing though.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
The fact that it was believable as it was,

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Konami doesn't exactly have the best reputation in the gaming industry right

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.000
now. And they did kind of dick PT over in a lot of other ways. Well,

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
I mean, canceling Silent Hills was probably one of the biggest,

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000
but you know what I mean?

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Like the fact that you can't even like download it and all this other stuff,

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.000
it's a little...

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Well, it's also not, let's not put it past them because I mean,

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000
after all they did also remove Hideo Kojima's name off the cover of,

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:57.000
you know, or any mention to him in, um, you know,

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Metal Gear Solid 5 and I don't know.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Yeah. Dart Tetsuya in chat kind of sums it up saying, yeah,

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:06.000
this isn't really out of the realm of possibility for them to do so.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
That's not a good look. I mean,

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
would you believe this story from any other gaming company? I don't know,

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
but, uh, that was it.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
They seem like a special kind of spiteful to do something like that though.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.000
If you buy into all the talk about some of the stuff they did to Kojima and

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:26.000
all this, apparently now Kibadea too. Like apparently they're just not nice people.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
It sounds like. So anyway,

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.000
let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.000
that will be coming out to a game store near you or online very soon. Loki.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000
All right. So we've got, um,

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000
on the switch moonlighter and then, uh,

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
we have carnival games coming out on the switch as well.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:51.000
De Rescini, I have no idea how to pronounce this.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Um, I think it's, Oh,

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
but it looks cool though. Uh, De Rescini, I guess.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:06.000
It's a game by armored, the armored core team from software. Um,

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000
it's a VR game, PlayStation VR. I'm down.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I don't know what it is or how to pronounce the fucking name,

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000
but if it's a PS VR game by from software, yes.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Yeah. Um, let's see.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.000
And then we've got the forest, which is a Sarava game on PlayStation four, uh,

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000
grip on the switch, which I believe is a racing game. Uh,

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:34.000
omen of sorrow on PlayStation four over kills the walking dead on PC and the

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000
world of final fantasy maxima on PC switch PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Oh yeah. I forgot they were re releasing that. Yeah. Yeah.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000
And then of course, last but not least on Friday,

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Tetris effect on PlayStation four. Uh,

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
some comments with releases in our chat. Uh,

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Shane says Loki is going to be so disappointed with that VR game from,

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.000
from software. Is there, is there reasoning?

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Is there evidence to support that claim? I don't know.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Curious what that's about. Maybe I will be. I don't know.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.000
S two and a hundred. Matt says, yeah, the forest. Great creepy game.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
I could be, you know,

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.000
I had to look up some screenshots now cause it's possible.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Maybe my expectations are too high.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:24.000
You high expectations.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
It's all right. Software though. Uh,

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Shane says it's like you're a ghost or something in a school. Oh, lame.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.000
All right. So it's not a, it's not a mech warrior game then. No,

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.000
that would be the one that's coming on the switch at some point. That's why.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
All right, well let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.000
over in Japan. So this week,

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000
uh, there's really just one to look forward to on the PlayStation four.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
It's Dara CNA I think is how you would pronounce the one that I was just

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.000
talking about. Yeah. Dara CNA is also out, uh, in Japan this week.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
So I guess it's a worldwide release if you will.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:56.000
And that really does appear to be the only major release on the PlayStation

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000
four this week. A Vita is slowing down as we kind of alluded to earlier in the

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
show. They have no releases this week. Uh,

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000
the Nintendo switch has a little bit more going on though.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
They have a Pika chin kit, game day,

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000
pyramechi daisatsu Sen. Uh, and then, uh,

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:15.000
they also have, uh, the, some amiibo coming out on the ninth.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Uh, their splatoon two series with the octoling girl, boy and octopus.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.000
That is all out in Japan this week. Now that I read up on this,

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000
it's a VR debut from director, uh,

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Hidetaka Miyazaki and from software Miyazaki and from software together,

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.000
probably going to be Cooney. No, that was level five. Hmm. I don't know.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
We'll, we'll see. I, I, I'm a little bit more optimistic now,

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:42.000
but check it out. All right. Uh, anyway, let's move over to the UK.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Loki, do you have those two? Yes. So, uh, coming out in the UK,

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.000
probably kind of the same type of stuff. We have carnival games on the switch,

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000
uh, grip on the switch, PlayStation four,

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Xbox one and PC ride three on, uh,

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:05.000
PlayStation four and Xbox one and PC 11 11

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:10.000
memories retold on PlayStation four and Xbox one,

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.000
uh, NBA two K playgrounds two on PlayStation four,

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Xbox one and the switch moonlighter on PlayStation four

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.000
and the switch hit man to gold edition. Um,

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.000
that's going to be coming out on the PlayStation four and Xbox

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.000
one. And then, uh, oh, actually a few more, uh, the Sims four expansion,

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:35.000
get famous, uh, Minecraft. And that was, that's on PC, uh,

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Minecraft story mode season two on the switch and the Gianna Swister or

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Gianna sisters, twisted dreams, ultimate edition on the switch.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:49.000
That's it. I didn't see any, uh, no Tetris effect over there.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Yeah. Um, or maybe it's online only or something. I don't know.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Maybe they're not doing a physical release over there.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Maybe it's just not on your list for whatever. That's strange. No. All right.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Well anyhow, uh,

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:03.000
let's go to the mailbag because every week you guys would send us emails over

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:07.000
at participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us emails.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.000
And this is the part of the show where we would read them if we had any.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Sadly, it's an empty mailbag this week.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:19.000
I guess we got to talk about failed us drag race or what was it?

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Oh, that's right. Cause we have to fill in talk with drag race.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.000
We don't get emails. We have to talk about RuPaul's drag race. Um, okay.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.000
They're going to be doing a RuPaul's drag race Christmas special this year that

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000
was announced this week. A one off Christmas special, uh,

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:36.000
that is going to feature Trixie Mattel and Latrice Royale and a lot of these

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:39.000
big names, plus some people we haven't seen in a while, like Sonique from season two.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Uh, but shangela is in it and considering all her game of thrones references,

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.000
the fact that she was robbed in all stars three, the fact that, you know,

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.000
with all the game of thrones,

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.000
she could just say winter is coming and that she's known for a lot of her

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Christmas looks like just fucking crown it like shangela's already won.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
It's going to be shangela versus Trixie in the end,

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
but this time they're going to crown shangela and that's, that's,

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
that's how, wow, world of wonder and everything we balance.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
All things should be, that's right.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Everything balance will be as much as I love Trixie Mattel. I really do. Uh,

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.000
all stars three with some, some messed up stuff. Don't you agree? Loki?

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Wasn't that messed up? All stars three.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Having no context of what you're talking about right now. I will,

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:18.000
I'll hesitate and agree. Yes. Okay. All right.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.000
That's enough punishment. Let's get into, uh, some more gaming news. Uh,

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
but if you want to, uh, talk about something other than RuPaul's drag race,

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000
you can send us an email.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Participate at orange launch trader.com is the place to send us an email in a

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000
future week. Loki.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.000
So we finally got the announcement of the full roster of games.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.000
They're going to be a part of the PlayStation classic. So starting in,

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.000
apparently it is in different regions. They have different games.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000
So let's start off with what we're getting in North America.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Battle riatoshi then cool borders to destruction Derby,

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:53.000
final fantasy seven grand theft auto intelligent cube jumping flash.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Mel, you're solid. Mr driller, odd world,

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.000
rolled Abe's odyssey Rayman resident evil director's cup,

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:04.000
revelations persona Ridge racer type form super puzzle fighter to turbo siphon

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:10.000
filter tech and three Tom Clancy's rainbow six twisted or twisted Mel and wild

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.000
arms. Uh, so those are all going to be coming to the North American version.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Um,

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000
lots of games that I'm surprised are missing from that list that I would have

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
thought that they weren't been there. Like, you know,

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
per rap of a rapper, um,

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:29.000
might have been one or even like Ein hinder or something like that.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Now in Japan, it's all stuff that's being remastered.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
It's all stuff that's been remastered somewhere else.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
So they don't want to put it on, but Japan seems to be getting the better of

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000
the two, you know, releases. Cause over there they're getting arc of the lad,

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000
arc of the lad to armored core. Um,

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Grady has guide in. Um,

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:53.000
I think it's not sigh saga, frontier G Darius and parasite Eve.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Those are all the exclusive ones. And then on top of that,

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Richard's type four intelligent cube, uh, jumping flash, puzzle fighter,

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.000
tech and three battle re-enthusiastic and resident evil, uh,

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.000
file 57, Mr. Driller persona, Miller, your soul and wild arms.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.000
I would rather have the Japanese one. I mean, well,

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
there's a lot of strong opinions in our chat room.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
I'll get to that in a minute, but I got to say like,

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.000
I wasn't really super on board with PlayStation classics to begin with just

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
because I'm feeling the classic system burnout.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Although earlier tonight before our shows went on air,

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Bobby and I were having a conversation cause we were coordinating the,

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
cause we're doing something special for post-show tonight.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.000
So we're coordinating that. But we also kind of talked about, he was like, Hey,

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Rob, uh, did you know that Commodore 64 mini finally got released, uh,

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000
in the U S officially this week? And I was like, Oh yeah, that's the thing.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Shit. I kind of want to buy that because I heard about the whole,

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:46.000
you can load D four or D 64 images on a USB stick and like play them on the

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
USB mini or on the Commodore 64 mini.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.000
So it opens like I could play whatever game I want basically.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Cause I mean shit, that system's like 35 years old.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
I think everybody's given up their copyright on that.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.000
That is really the only reason why I want one of these is because that shit is

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.000
going to be broken up day one and I can put whatever the fuck I want on there.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:08.000
You know, if I want to play driver for example. Well, you know what,

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000
actually now that I think of it, why aren't some of these games on there?

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000
And actually I'm surprised armored cores on there because that I thought was

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
something that used the dual shock a little bit.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Well, so does metal gear solid infamously,

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000
but when you put it on the table and it shakes, remember that?

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:25.000
But I won't be there. Yeah, they're not going to have that.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Obviously they're going to save that for the second one.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Yeah, of course they're thinking ahead like that,

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
but I think maybe they're saving too much for the second one.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
They should have thought ahead and made this one expandable.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:37.000
I thought when we got into the whole fact that this should have just been like

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.000
a Vita TV loaded with PlayStation games,

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000
like I thought that was really honestly the brilliant idea because you download

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
more on the internet, but whatever. It's not going to be that.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.000
And I just, I'm a little burned out on the classic systems and I'm,

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.000
I think it's great that some deep cuts like a super puzzle.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Well, really intelligent cube is the deep cut and that's a hard to get.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Like stuff like 16 bit and NES games look pretty nice when it's up res

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:06.000
and stuff in like, you know, 4k or even just like a 1080 or whatever.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.000
PlayStation 1 games, not so much.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Low tech, you know, the low quality textures, low poly,

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:21.000
not, doesn't age as well as, you know, a 16 bit game that's all sprite based.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I mean, it's just, it's not the same.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
And I think even like with the Nintendo 64,

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
that's going to be kind of cutting it a little bit.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000
I mean, granted, I'd still probably pick it up because I love Nintendo 64 as well,

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.000
but I hadn't even going back and playing like Ridge Racer type four.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000
It's like, I don't remember it looking this bad.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Going to chat, Bobby Blackwolf is talking about the Commodore 64 mini saying

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
it was broken up by the hardware manufacturer.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
It's not even a third party firmware update.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
It's a first party firmware update, the official site.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
I mean, it might be a little less cool for you, but whatevs.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Yeah. I mean, important distinction.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.000
That Commodore 64 thing is like an official update that's supported by the makers.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.000
It's not, it's not cool.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
They are. Yeah. Which, yeah, I think that is cool.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.000
But again, and you can also, I guess I'm going to just talk everything

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.000
that Bobby and I talked about off air,

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.000
but Bobby and I were talking about how funny would it be to do a live stream

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.000
on the VOG channel or something where we type a program in

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
from the back of a magazine live.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
That would be cool.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Why wouldn't that be awesome?

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I think it would.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:26.000
There is, there is a category on Twitch for computer programming

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000
or something like that.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
So I know there's game development because that's it.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
That's a game because I try to like, that's the thing is like,

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
you know how they have all those tags and stuff.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:37.000
So I try to tag my stream, my streams I do with some relevant tags,

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.000
but they're all like for the IRL stuff.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:45.000
So I'm like, well crap, I can't, none of this really applies to what I'm doing.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Our chat room is lighting up.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:51.000
And so, you know what, all I'm going to say is this, please look forward to it.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
I think this is something we're going to have to do.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:57.000
The official typing in, maybe we'll have to do it for charity or something.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Let me get a charity thing.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Like I'll do it for part of the day.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.000
I really want to do like.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Bobby can do it.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.000
The extra life thing would have been awesome if I got like, you know,

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
a day to myself.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
I know, I know.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Get a set mania machine, put it in there.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Dartusia says, make sure you have a USB keyboard.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.000
You'll have to use the hunt and peck keyboard and you'll be there all day.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Honestly, I feel like it'll go by faster on a real keyboard.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Like I know how to type on those now.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Like when I was like, cause remember when the Converse 64 was out,

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
I was like six.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
So I was doing the hunt and peck thing until, you know,

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000
I used my typing tutorials, FFFJJ, FFFJJ to learn how to type.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.000
But anyway.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.000
I never learned how to type.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Okay.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
It wasn't supposed to be about the Commodore 64 mini,

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.000
although I guess maybe you guys are responding to that more positively.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:44.000
I do want to read some comments about the PlayStation classic mini.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.000
SG100 Matt says, some of those games are pretty good.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Act Def says, the PlayStation classic sucks, sucks big time.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Shane says, this list announcement caused me to cancel my pre-order.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Dartusia says, I do appreciate them, including Toshinen and IQ,

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.000
but a good chunk of those games support the DualShock.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Orange Right saying, it's cool to see R4 at least.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Yeah.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
That's R4 is like, but see, that's the thing too.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Like R4 is a pretty good game.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Cool Wars 2, I think is better than the first one.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:17.000
But like, I guess like with Twisted Metal and stuff that maybe it's because,

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
you know, the other games use the DualShock.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Like I would have thought Twisted Metal 2 would have been a better choice.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Or like, I don't know, like even with, um, I don't know.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Some of these, like I just don't see it.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Mr. Driller.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Really? Is that like really worth putting in there?

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.000
I mean, it's an all right game.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000
That game was pretty huge.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.000
I think in other areas that weren't necessarily the US.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Yeah.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Or Grand Theft Auto.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:45.000
I mean, Grant, the original Grand Theft Auto is kind of, it's old.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
It's so old.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.000
I don't remember.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:49.000
I don't remember.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Well, Sandra isn't all that.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.000
So that was all PlayStation 2.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000
That was the only problem.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Well, people are going to think Grand Theft Auto is like,

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
they're going to see that and think, oh,

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:00.000
it's like the new ones and then kind of be a little disappointed.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.000
No, no, it's not.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
All right.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Well, anyway,

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:08.000
let's move on to some other things that were announced at BlizzCon.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Again, this is one of those things I'm kind of surprised they didn't do on

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.000
the main stage.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Um, but it was something they kind of, you know,

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
had out there on the show floor, maybe because it was third party.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000
I don't know.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Well, I thought they announced this before.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I think they announced the partnership between Lego and Overwatch,

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:25.000
but we got details.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:28.000
I saw those earlier in the week, but maybe that's just,

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000
maybe they leaked out or something.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Well, whatever.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Anyway.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.000
I still want them.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Six Overwatch themed building sets.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:35.000
That's the point.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
With vehicles, characters, and weapons from the game.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Starting next year, there's a Tracer versus Widowmaker set,

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:45.000
where you can do the drone satellite from Watchpoint Gibraltar.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.000
There's a Hanzo versus Genji where you're in the Hanamura dojo.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.000
That's pretty cool.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Dorado Showdown will be Soldier 76, Reaper,

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
and McCree in buildings from the Dorado map.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:57.000
And there's a D.Va and Reinhardt set with a buildable mech suit

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:01.000
and a powered armor that the heroes will bring into battle.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
So it's kind of like, you know,

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.000
their characters are much more involved because you build the whole mech

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
and then you build the whole Reinhardt shield and all that.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.000
So that's pretty cool.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.000
There's a Bastion set with a buildable version of the character

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.000
and you can do both recon mode and sentry mode

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000
because Legos, you can change it.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
So that's kind of fun.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:21.000
There is a 730 piece Watchpoint Gibraltar set

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.000
with Mercy, Reaper, Winston, and Pharah.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000
These sets will start at $14.99,

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.000
which is probably for that smaller, maybe the Hanamura set,

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:35.000
and go all the way up to $90 probably for that Watchpoint Gibraltar

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000
because Legos ain't cheap.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:40.000
So anyway, you can start getting these on January 1st, 2019.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Actually, you can start getting them now

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.000
because they have that one Bastion set.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
It was the alternate skin or whatever

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
that you can actually get through the Blizzard store.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
You can get that now.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:54.000
That's cool.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
I wonder if my, since my husband likes Overwatch so much,

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000
I wonder if he would want me to spend all that money on Overwatch Legos.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
I don't know.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
He's making an ahh noise from the other room.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Act Def does say in chat over at live.vognetware.com

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
$90 is kind of too much.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Have you looked at Legos lately?

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.000
You must not shop for Legos often.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
It's a good thing it's not Star Wars.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Yeah, right.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Anyway, a few more stories before we get to the Skype line

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
at Orange Launch Radio.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Loki.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Their stupid $799 Millennium Falcon.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Yeah, they can shove that $799 up their ass

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
because I ain't never gonna pay that.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:36.000
So anyways, talking about classic collections.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Sega Genesis classics are gonna be coming to Nintendo Switch in December.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:46.000
And you're gonna get 50 classic Sega Mega Drive and Genesis titles.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
And there's a lot.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
And I'm not gonna read all of them, but I'll read some of them

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
that I think that you might like.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000
So for example, let's talk about Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Or we have Alien Storm.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Or Altered Beasts.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Columns.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Comic Zone.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Of course, Golden Axe, Golden Axe 2, Golden Axe 3.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Fantasy Star 2, 3, and 4.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Shining Force 1 and 2.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, 3D Blast.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Street Rage 1, 2, and 3.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Toejam and Earl 1 and 2.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Vector Man, Vector Man 2.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000
And Virtual Fighter 2, among lots of other games.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Most of the same shit Sega's released over and over again over the years.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Although, I feel like they don't do Alex Kidd stuff enough.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
So I'm happy to hear that's coming back.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:40.000
But it's gonna be on the Switch because, you know, that's December 7th.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.000
And because, of course, they're not doing Virtual Console anymore,

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
so this is why it's all in the collection.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Which, actually, probably for the money, you're gonna get a better deal

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
than if you bought those all separately on Virtual Console.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Oh, for sure.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Now that I think about it, since I brought up Alex Kidd,

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
why does the Sega bring that kid back?

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:59.000
It seems like one of those old franchises that's really due for a reboot

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
that, for whatever reason, has never happened. That's weird.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Is it because Sonic kind of took over all their platforming,

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
so they have that tunnel vision?

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
And that's all they want to release when it comes to platforming is Sonic?

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
I'd love to see a new Alex Kidd game.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
No, Alex Kidd doesn't have enough stupid friends to bring along for the ride.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Well, invent some.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Alex Kidd in Shinobi World, you know, all that.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Maybe Alex Kidd can get introduced as one of Sonic's friends,

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
and then we'll spin it off into it.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Well, and I'm sure somebody in chat's gonna have already said this,

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.000
but Alex Kidd was in the Sega All-Stars racing game.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
The one with Danica Patrick.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Oh yeah, that new one's supposed to be coming out.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
I got him delayed, remember?

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.000
At some point.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Yeah, I got pushed back a little bit, so I think that was a couple weeks ago,

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
we talked about that, so.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Anyway, something else you can look forward to,

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
and I'm sure you will be looking forward to this,

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
a brand new Bubsy game.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.000
I can't even say his name right.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Fuck that shit.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Bubsy.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
It's Bubsy, that's right.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Aren't you excited that there's a new Bubsy game coming out?

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.000
No, I'm not. He's an obnoxious piece of shit.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Bubsy Paws on Fire will be coming out for PC, PlayStation 4, and Switch.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Who wanted this?

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Who wanted Bubsy?

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Nobody fucking wants Bubsy.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Apparently people bought the stupid Bubsy game,

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
because otherwise they wouldn't be making another Bubsy game.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Well, Bubsy will be bringing along three of his shitty friends

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
for four playable characters,

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
that each one has their own unique play style,

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
according to the press release.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Oh wow, that's so 2019 or 18.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.000
New moves never before seen in a Bubsy title.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
And over 100 levels.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
And they say, I love this, this is in the press release,

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Paws on Fire is a game for Bubsy lovers and haters alike.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
No, if I hate it, I'm not buying it.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
I love it. I loved it in the press release.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
This one's for my haters.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000
This goes out to my haters.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000
You know what, if you're gonna bring back old-ass platformer games,

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:53.000
then I want a fucking new Gex game, god damn it.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Gex deserves another game.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Now, Akdeft in chat points out the only good thing about this

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.000
is that it's made by the people from the Bit.Trip Runner series.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
It does look like this is a runner game,

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
which is how they made 100-plus levels.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
It looks like it might be a runner title.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Which, you know, low-key, before I know you,

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
I feel the judgment coming off of you,

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.000
but those Bit.Trip Runner games are pretty fucking good, I gotta say.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:18.000
So, I mean, if they're just slapping Bubsy onto that,

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.000
I mean, downright-

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Do you know why they're good?

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Because Bubsy is not fucking in those games.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
That's why they're good.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Nobody said, hey, you know what?

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
These runner games, they need more Bubsy.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Rageinator in chat says,

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:33.000
new moves never seen before in a Bubsy game.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Does that feature make it fun?

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Is Shane still listening?

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Shane, if you're listening, I got a question for you.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Which was worse?

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:45.000
The Quiet Man or Bubsy 3D?

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000
What do you think, Logie?

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Which one's worse, the Quiet Man?

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Which would you rather be forced to play for an hour?

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
The Quiet Man or Bubsy 3D?

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Bubsy 3D.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Shane confirming in chat that the Quiet Man was the worst game.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Exactly.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
So, Bubsy, you got that.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
At least you're not the Quiet Man.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Avant-garde Bubsy.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Yeah, that's all I need to say.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.000
And the trick in Bubsy is that there's no sound.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Whatsoever.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Anyway, just a couple more stories for you guys,

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.000
and then we'll take your loud phone calls over on Skype at Orange Launch Radio.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Logie?

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
So, it's that time.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
The time when all of your modern systems get emulated.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000
And what system is next on the list?

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Why, of course, it's a Nintendo Switch.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.000
So apparently there's this emulator called the Yuzu emulator

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:41.000
that has managed to run Super Mario Odyssey

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:44.000
completely through the whole game.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
So, it does work in the emulator.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Granted, there are some graphical glitches and some slowdowns,

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000
but it is playable, and you can play from the beginning to the end.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:57.000
And they even have a way where you can download the patches and everything.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:03.000
So, pretty far progress considering that this is the first I'm hearing of it.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:08.000
So, I'm definitely on board with seeing what they're gonna do with this.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Of course, no good things, obviously.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000
It's gonna be modded like crazy.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Balzette's gonna be in here in like a matter of time.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Just matter of...

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Just gotta wait.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
The TTB.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Joy.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Did you hear that Nintendo confirmed this week, by the way,

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:31.000
that that hat can't be used on any other characters?

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000
It can only be used on Toadette.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Or, what is it? No.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Yeah, the hat is only used on Toadette to make Peach Hat.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
You can't use it on other characters.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.000
So, just so you know, everybody, Nintendo has officially confirmed

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Balzette is not canon.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
So, please remove her from the internet now.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:49.000
You were wrong.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.000
And I am going to point out why you're wrong.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Because in an official art book for Super Mario Odyssey,

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Nintendo actually, before the internet came up with Balzette,

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
came up with Balzette.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
It's already a thing. It's already canon.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.000
It's already canon.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Yes, but then it was deleted as all of your accounts ought to be.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Just saying.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Dartetsuya in chat says,

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Switch emulators already?

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:22.000
I mean, I guess I'm not surprised, but I'll stick with my official hardware.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Yeah, it could be risky.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Probably gonna be very buggy, too.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.000
And Rama in chat, in reference to my Balzette hating, says,

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Dear Rob Roberts, we will reject your false notions.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
I don't know, though.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Honestly, though, the emulators that run Wii U games and stuff

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
run them better than the Wii U.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:44.000
I can't see that this wouldn't be that difficult to...

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.000
I mean, yeah, it's probably not running great right now

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
because they haven't optimized a ton of stuff.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:52.000
But it will get there, I think.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:57.000
And then we'll have 4K Mario Odyssey and modded craziness.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Alright, well, one more story for you guys.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
And chatters behave. Stop dragging me.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Because this is a serious one to end on, this note tonight.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
The inspiration, or I should say the namesake,

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
maybe not totally the inspiration,

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
but the namesake for Nintendo's Mario character

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000
actually passed away this week at the age of 84.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Mario Segal? I hope I said that name right.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.000
S-E-G-A-L-E? Segal?

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Mario Segal actually passed away this week, again, at the age of 84.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Passed away on October 27th.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Who was he? He was not a plumber.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.000
He developed office buildings and malls in Washington state.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.000
He actually sold this all in 1998 for about 60 million.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:39.000
In the year 1981, he was renting a warehouse to Nintendo of America.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
And Miyamoto created the Mario character,

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.000
but of course originally the name of the character was Jumpman.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
And then the girlfriend was Lady.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Well, at some point, Nintendo wanted proper names,

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.000
so they named the hero Mario after this landlord.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:58.000
And then Pauline was actually named after a wife of a Nintendo of America employee.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
So that is where the name came from.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Believe it or not.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.000
He apparently rejected his connection to the Mario franchise

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:08.000
because he thought it might harm his business ventures.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.000
In a 1993 interview with the Seattle Times, he just said,

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.000
you might say I'm still waiting for my royalty checks.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.000
Regardless, it sounds like Mario may not have been named Mario

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:23.000
if it wasn't for him, so whether he likes it or not,

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:26.000
I suppose he's forever a part of that video game canon.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.000
But interesting to know that Mario, the name,

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
had nothing to do with a plumber or any of that other stuff

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:35.000
that goes with the lore behind the Mario character.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:38.000
In chat at live.vognetwork.com, D'Artesia says,

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:42.000
I mean, just think about different things would be if it weren't for him.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.000
That's right. I mean, if the real estate developer had been named something else

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.000
or they decided to name it after another character, I mean, Mario is iconic.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Mario is a Mickey Mouse for this generation.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Like, everybody knows Mario.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.000
If you're, you know, under a certain age, even if you're over a certain age,

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
you still probably know who Mario is.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:04.000
S200Matt says, this is like Spielberg naming the shark in Jaws Bruce

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:08.000
after his lawyer. I'm not so sure that was a compliment, though.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Tigerclaw wants to know, where did the name Luigi come from?

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Good question. It wasn't really addressed in the Mario story,

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:17.000
so I'm not sure where Luigi came from, but I'm sure,

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
got to be out there on the internet somewhere.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
If you can weed your way through all the Bowsette photos,

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
you can probably figure out where that came from.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:24.000
I'm pretty curious, too.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Dark Tetsuya says, oh, check out the brain on Dark Tetsuya.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Dark Tetsuya says, his name is a Japanese pun on the word for similar,

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:35.000
since he's similar to Mario's sprite in Mario Brothers.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Clever. And if you think about it, Luigi wasn't in Donkey Kong.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
They didn't have to name him when they named Mario,

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:45.000
so he was named later, probably when they did the Mario Brothers game,

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
which would have been after Donkey Kong,

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:51.000
because there was no Luigi in Donkey Kong, so food for thought.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Anyway, our Skype line is open, if you want to give us a call.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, to give us a call on Skype for the night,

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
and we can talk about Diablo, I guess.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:02.000
If you want to talk about Bowsette, we can, although I'd rather not.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
We can talk about whatever you want over at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
all one word on Skype.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:10.000
While we wait for our phone to ring, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Yeah, so the Nintendo Switch has reached 22.86 million units sold

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:19.000
that's surpassing the GameCube lifetime sales,

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:22.000
so that's pretty good in comparison, of course.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:31.000
The 3DS is 73.5 million units, and the Wii U 13.56 million units.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.000
We have a call coming in. Let's get to it.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
I'm going to pick up the phone here.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000
By the way, we did get a reprieve on the Skype thing.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Skype is still working on Windows XP.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:46.000
I guess Microsoft pushed back the time to pull the plug for whatever reason.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Anyway, I think we are there.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Not working. Try calling without the video.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
I think the video is slowing you down.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Sorry about that, Loki. Do you have something else to put in there?

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Speaking of numbers, PlayStation 4 shipped 86.1 million units worldwide.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
That's a lot of PlayStations.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
That is a lot of PlayStation, yeah.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Their gaming revenue is up 27%. Profit up 65%, so don't let them tell you that they don't have enough money.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Because they are making plenty of it.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Alright, I'm going to try this call again and see if it comes through.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Hi, this is Rachael. Sorry about that.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
I have connection problems over on my end.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Apparently. That's alright, though. We got you now.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
What's up, buddy? What's on your mind tonight?

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Yeah, well, granted, I'm a little late to the show. Sorry about that. I had all the commitments, but...

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
I see how it is.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Yeah, well, sometimes real life happens. But seriously, though...

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
We are your life now.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Well, I could say something, but I'm trying to keep this radio appropriate.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Yeah, good idea. Good idea.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Yeah, good idea.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
But seriously, though...

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Since you were talking about the PlayStation Classic that will be coming out this holiday...

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
I have a question for you.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Do you see yourself picking this up, or do you see yourself passing it out?

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:31.000
And whatever your answer is, please explain either way.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Yes, sir. I think I did kind of mention it earlier, but I'll just reiterate.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:41.000
My plan is to pass on this, and the reason why is that I'm a little burned out on all the classic consoles.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:49.000
I think it's a little ridiculous that the PlayStation 4 just won't play the PlayStation 1 games that I still have in the case, ready to go, to play on it.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:55.000
And I realize something can be said about, you know, well, then why would you buy an NES Classic when you have Nintendo games?

02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Which, I mean, I suppose is fair, but at the same time, those, you know, at that time, to buy the little NES Classic, the SNES Classic, those were super cute as well.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:11.000
And I'm not saying the PlayStation Classic isn't cute, but they did make some questionable design choices, such as omitting the DualShock, such as charging $100 for 20 games.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Sorry, but I don't think these games are worth that price tag that they're putting out.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:21.000
So, kind of all those things together does it in for me. But you know what I did pay money for? I should point this out.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:30.000
So, my little collection that I have of these classic arcade games, right? I picked up this BurgerTime one. I mentioned that a couple weeks ago, because that's like a fancier one, right?

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:38.000
I picked up two brand new ones at $35 a pop. I just haven't put them out yet. I wonder if Alan just went in the other room and grabbed them. I don't know.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Oh, yes, he did. He's bringing them in the studio now. So, the two new ones I just bought this week and were Mappy, which I thought was pretty cool, that there's one for that, and Dig Dug.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Dig Dug is kind of that 80s game that I'm actually okay at. I can actually play it quite a bit. So, Alan wants to give some input on all of this. Apparently, my classic gaming collection hobby. Yes, Alan?

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:08.000
The one thing that I dislike about the new series is that they're slightly bigger than the series one and two, so they don't look like they belong.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:13.000
They're different companies. They're not the same. Like, they're not the same companies making them. So, that's why.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:14.000
I retract my statement.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:23.000
Okay. Oh, wait, wait. Before you run away. Before you run away, why don't you answer our caller's question? Would you buy the PlayStation Classic for $100? Why or why not?

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:28.000
I would. Just, I mean, I would.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
No, you will not.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I would need a lot of, like, a windfall of money where I would buy something that frivolous, but I'm not, like, offended by what the plan is or what the games are on it or anything.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Okay. All right. Loki, what's your perspective on that? Thanks for stopping by. Loki?

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:56.000
I don't know if I have an extra $100 to dump on that, and also besides, I, like, I bought, well, first off, I bought a Coleco, a ColecoVision, one of the plug and play classic things. I haven't used it.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:08.000
I bought an SNES classic. I've hardly used it. So, buying this again would be, like, I probably won't use it. That's why I probably wouldn't buy one. I do want one so it can hack it, but that's about all I want.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Interesting verbiage from Bobby Blackwolf in our chat who says, I'm skipping on the PlayStation Classic because I don't have the emotional connection to the system.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Right, and that's the other thing, too. It's, like, honestly, like, it's really easy to emulate PlayStation 1 games. You can do it, and it will look-

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
It's easier to emulate NES games.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
It's incredibly easy, yes.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:34.000
But yet, I don't know. I don't know. Well, RageNator, do we give you what you were looking for? What's your opinion on it all?

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Yeah, well, I'm tempted to give one, you know, because I do have the emotional connection. I did have PlayStation 1 way back in the day. In fact, you know, I got mine back in April of 97, you know, a couple weeks after I got N64.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:27:06.000
And a lot of the games that you listed, I do have played, you know, some I haven't played, so there's that. You know, I at least want to try them at least once, at least the ones I haven't played.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:20.000
However, the key thing is, now this is coming out holiday time. You mentioned there's a $100 purchase, not including sales tax. And my budget for Christmas is extremely limited.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Sure.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:41.000
I'm just barely able to save up $200 for Christmas, and every single last cent is already spoken for in terms of buying Christmas presents. In fact, one of which is going to cost me like $120. So that's a lot of money that's being spent on Christmas presents.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Well, someone's getting spoiled.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000
Yeah, I'm not saying who, and-

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
And in our business, it's fine.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Yeah, and what the present is, that's $120, because that kind of thing is kind of inappropriate to mention on stream, but it's, let's just say it's one of those gifts.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Alright, okay.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Yeah, I know no one else can see me but Rob, but I'm using air quotes around those gifts.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
I'm looking away right now.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Yeah, so you can probably use your imagination right there.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:28.000
No, I won't be using my imagination on that whatsoever. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners, Rageator, before I let you go?

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Nah, I'm all set, but thanks for taking my call.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Hey, you're welcome.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:42.000
I'll try to catch your next show and Bobby's show next week, and it's entirely assuming that the real-life plans don't happen.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Well, there's always the podcast, that's what it's for, so you can listen to it when it's convenient for you and your busy life.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Yeah, well, have a nice night.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000
You too, take care, buddy.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:59.000
Alright, Skype's lighting up tonight, we gotta get to another call here, so I'm gonna pick up another call on the line and get to it.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Ah, excellent, this is Zormay. How are you guys doing?

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Hi, are you a first-time caller? I don't recognize the name.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:13.000
No, it's not. Sky, I spoke a few times over the last ten years.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Okay, so it's just a long-time dormant, we'll say then.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:25.000
I mean, sort of. I do have been able to keep up with you guys because of Twitter and Facebook.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:31.000
I actually remembered that you guys were on because you tweeted about it, and I'm actively on Twitter myself.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Hooray, social networking works! Yay! Pipping my shit on social media all the time. Awesome.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Great.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Oh, you're right, I do recognize the name. Bobby had to spell it out for me in chat. I do remember your name, I sure do.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.000
So, what's on your mind? What do we owe the phone call to tonight?

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Actually, you know, I'm just really happy to see you guys still on the air and talking about the things that you love, and I enjoy it.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:02.000
I'm a big DDR fan, I actually am in the process of trying to get myself my own machine.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Oh!

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Yeah.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Now you know that's something Loki recently did.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:17.000
You see, that's the whole thing. I wish that if Loki could probably give me any pointers on picking out one and keeping up with it, I'm really looking for that.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Well, Loki, how did you find your machine? What's the upkeep been like for you?

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:36.000
I just kept checking different places, like eBay, there's a buy-sell-trade Facebook group that you can become a part of that sometimes people will sell machines.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Craigslist, I got lucky with Facebook Marketplace, someone just was dumping a machine, the guy was a collector and he didn't really play DDR too much, he just wanted to get rid of the machine, so I got it really cheap.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:58.000
And because he was trying to clear it out to me, because he's like, to be honest, I just want to get rid of this so I can get four more machines that can fit in the space that this one machine was in.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Because he had like three rooms in his house in the garage that was also full of arcade games.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:07.000
So he was getting rid of that in like a Gauntlet Legends, which is like, ooh, Gauntlet.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:14.000
But that's how I got lucky there. And as far as upkeep, really all I've done is like cleaned the pads.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:26.000
I lucked out, I don't know if it's lucky or not, but like I have it, it's an LCD screen in there, so it's like an LCD TV and not the original CRT screens, so I know there's a lot more upkeep with those.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Granted, the images stretch a little bit, but that's not going to be a problem when I put StepMania in there at some point or if I manage to hack in one of the newer arcade games.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:45.000
But as far as like the upkeep and stuff, it's like I did go through and clean the pads out because they were pretty dirty.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Apparently the machine had come from the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk at some point.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:56.000
I was trying to find like old video to see if I could find where it was, but that's where they claim it came from.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:05.000
It was a third Korean at some point and got upgraded to an Extreme. And so it was dirty. It had lots of beach sand in there.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:11.000
And so I've cleaned out one side of the pads. I didn't clean out the other side yet, which I probably should do.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Well, if you're going to be inviting me over, you better clean that up.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Well, the only reason I could clean out the first side, because the first side was missing like crazy. The second side played just fine.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:24.000
So I was like, oh, I'm just going to clean out this one side and it's never got around to doing the other one.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:38.000
I also need to get surface mount screws on there so that everything's inset and not sticking out, because I trip myself on those screws quite often.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
Ah, that could be painful.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:44.000
So can you remind me again, what mix did you have? You have Extreme, right?

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I have Extreme, yeah.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:52.000
OK. And I'm pretty sure you actually have it shipped from California. So I'm on the East Coast.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Well, I lucked out. I didn't have to ship it. The guy was local to me. He was like maybe 10 minutes away.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:03.000
So I just grabbed the U-Haul and I had a couple of friends help me get in there.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:08.000
So I got really lucky when I didn't have it shipped because shipping would be pretty expensive.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:16.000
But yeah, I kind of lucked out. It's hard to find new machines out there.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:23.000
I mean, honestly, like I was almost going to build my own because it might end up being cheaper that route.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:31.000
But I don't know. You can do like even like if you get like, well, the step mania step maniacs pads are pretty expensive.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Like I think they're a thousand bucks or something. But wow. You can if if you're willing to pay that, you can just get a LCD TV and mount it.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
And then that's about the machine right there.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:46.000
OK. I've seen some because I actually use the Sows Network, the money.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:56.000
So you guys know about that. But, you know, on there, they told me that there's actually a possibly get newer versions like we can get like to DDR 2014.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:04.000
And, you know, and there's a guy that talks about how he can help me set it up. But it's just like it's a hit or miss about the newer ones.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:09.000
And they have a lot of older ones, like five hundred, six hundred dollars roughly about the extreme.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:14.000
And they just said that you might have to fix it. And I don't know too much about like going into it, fixing it.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:19.000
Like I have the the private server, you know, to kind of play beat mania.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:28.000
I have like the program world. But over here, you know, by Chinatown Fair, they actually had the people who actually installed it in the machines over there.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.000
So but like getting the machine as I'm thinking about shipping.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:39.000
So I'm glad that you let me know a little bit about that. I'll see what how it is on the East Coast.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Shipping is probably going to be a few hundred dollars just because they have to pallet it and everything.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:52.000
I mean, the machines themselves, they're not too heavy because they're on wheels for the most part.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:59.000
I mean, so it was pretty it was pretty easy just to get it in and out of U-Haul for me.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:06.000
I mean, well, my actual my plan is I don't know about over on the West Coast, but well, it is over there as well.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:13.000
But you've heard of like TaskRabbit. Yeah, I think I've heard of it.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Yeah. So there's like a way you can people you just hire people on demand and they'll help you move things and fix stuff and and whatnot.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:29.000
So that's my actual plan for the lifting because I have to live on the second floor in like in Brooklyn here in New York.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:34.000
So that's like one of the things I'm really interested in because I can at least get the help for that.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:40.000
But the actual fixing of it or maybe I was like I was hoping that maybe there was some sort of like I know there's a wiki out there somewhere.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:46.000
But, you know, it's making sure they're up to date and dated. You know, I might I'm a fan extreme.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.000
I might just do extreme. So but I think that's that's all. That's all I basically thanks a lot for that.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:57.000
No worries, buddy. And it's good to hear from you. And best of luck in your hunt to chase down a DDR machine.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:04.000
And I hope when you get one that you don't, you know, ruin your relationship with your downstairs neighbors.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:09.000
You may want to talk to you may want to talk to Rama in our chat room because he says, yo, I know people in Brooklyn.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:15.000
So, oh, yeah, I definitely will. I'll hit up the chat. All right.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Sounds good. Well, take care, my friend. Thanks for the call. All right. Take care. Yep. Bye bye.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Orange launch radio, all one word on Skype. We can probably squeeze in one more call before we call the night here at Orange launch radio.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:33.000
So get those phones ringing. Did you have any other last minute stories you want to sneak in here? Yeah, this is kind of interesting.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:39.000
I completely forgot this is coming up, but apparently this coming up weekend is inside Xbox XO 18.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Oh, yeah. Isn't that like in Mexico City or something? I believe so. Yeah. So that's going to be coming up this weekend.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:50.000
So I guess we'll have some news. They say they run three to five p.m. central time.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:57.000
They're going to have this inside Xbox. It's going to be taking place at 18 central time on Saturday.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:02.000
So three to five central. So I have to check it out and see what they're going to announce.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Do you think? Yeah, I was going to say, do you think they're going to be any big announcements or do you think Xbox classic?

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:16.000
That would be weird. I mean, neat. But yeah, I don't think they would do that because they have backwards compatibility.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:21.000
They're not stupid like some of the other. Yeah. All right. All right.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Well, let's get one more call in here. And I'm sorry to those that aren't going to get through tonight.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:29.000
But, you know, you can always email us. Hi, you're on Orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on?

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:37.000
It is Ron. Hey, Ron. What's on your mind, buddy? Not too much. I guess I do have like the quick trigger finger to get onto the Skype line.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Yes. Yes. You beat out thousands of others to get through once again. I'm just kidding. What's on your mind, though?

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Couple of things. Number one. Yeah, I'm still waiting on Sony to announce backwards compatibility of PS one and PS two games in the PlayStation.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Don't hold your breath. Yeah, keep it. I know. I know. But I'm finally going to get one because Target's going to have the one terabyte console for 200 bucks.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Hmm. OK, so because, you know, Black Friday deals are leaking left and right. And I said that's the only way I'm getting next gen consoles.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:12.000
If they're 200 bucks on Black Friday and I'm glad I got my Xbox one last year. Yeah, that is a pretty darn good deal.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:26.000
I got to say. So don't blame me there. And the second thing, I know you hate this whole Bowser thing, but you got this.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:35.000
I have this amazing cosplay group I'm putting together for a con next year. I'm going to tell you and I think you're going to like it.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:42.000
I can't wait to not see pictures. No, I'm just kidding. What is it? Oh, we're going to be doing selfies on the mixture. I send them to you.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Oh, boy. All right. So we're going to have to my friends are twins are going to be Bowser and booing.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:59.000
And through some convincing, I am doing a modification of a Ghostbusters jumpsuit as Luigi.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:04.000
OK, so you will be trapping Boozette live during the convention?

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Probably so. And we're going to play off the supposed quote unquote relationship between Buette and Luigi, because what I see is this.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Buette sees Luigi as her boyfriend and Luigi has no fucking clue as to this.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:26.000
You cosplayers have so much fucking time on your hands to invent these stories. All of this shipping going on.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Nothing but love. Nothing but love. I'm just being a bitch.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Oh, you should see the Gundam Wing fandom. That's a story for another time.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Bobby Black Wolf suggests to do Pea Chowser, not Bowsette. And then that way you trick me.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Well, only half my cosplay friends. That could happen. But I talked to Mako Char.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:53.000
She's going to join in. She's going into a variant of Daisy based off of Janine Melanin from the animated series.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Now, see, when you told me that I would be into it, I thought you'd be like, I know all these like shirtless gay dudes who are going to be doing like Bowsette.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:04.000
But like as male without shirts on, I'd be like, OK, well, you can send me that.

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:09.000
I do have a dude dressed up as Bowsette I saw over the weekend. I can send you pictures of that.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:15.000
All right. We got my number. Area code 916. I'm just going to give my phone number out on her.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:20.000
I also have some shirtless cross play Sailor Moon dudes for you as well.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:24.000
All right. Well, that's right of Allen's alley. Allen loves Sailor Moon.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Someone needs the cosplay Bowsette, but the Dennis Hopper Bowser.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:35.000
See that I might have to get someone to do that as well. Now, that's funny.

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:40.000
By the way, since since Rama brought up Ghostbusters, I forgot to say, you know, they have that Ghostbusters game.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:44.000
That's kind of like the takeoff on Pokemon Go that came out. I played that a little bit this week.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:48.000
It uses the AR stuff like you have to like put a trap on the ground.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.000
It doesn't it's not like throwing a ball. They didn't try to copy that thing for Pokemon Go.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:56.000
So they made like a whole different type of capture thing with the Ghostbusters thing.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:00.000
So I thought Rama reminded me of that. I did play that because, you know what, Loki?

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Once in a while, I'll just try a mobile game that sounds remotely interesting because it's free.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:10.000
And because you have a phone. Because I have a phone. Don't you have a phone?

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
I do have a phone.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:16.000
That's it. Thank you, Tigerclaw. Ghostbusters World. That's the name of it.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Don't you have a phone, Rama? I haven't heard it yet. Don't you have a phone?

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Yes, I have a phone.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:26.000
I know. I'm just saying. It's the question we're all asking each other this week.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:31.000
I just upgraded my phone so now I can actually download and play more games.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Oh, there you go.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:37.000
I have about 20 games on my phone and I sit there, I play Sailor Moon and drops all damn day.

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:41.000
You and my husband both. Jesus. All right.

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Well, Rama, I'm going to wrap up and let you go. But any other quick final thoughts for our listeners?

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:53.000
I agree with Bobby Blackwolf about the retro consoles. I mean, honestly, I'm not buying into the PlayStation Classic.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:42:02.000
I can't see myself doing it. I mean, honestly, I'd rather track down a PS1, mod it, download the iCells and play it.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:06.000
And that will probably be a lot cheaper than buying a classic. Just saying.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:11.000
Yeah, I know. Well, you know, Sony would prefer you didn't do it that way.

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:15.000
But then, you know what? As far as I'm concerned, Sony could have released those things on PlayStation 4.

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Let me use my PlayStation 1 disc. It's getting a little silly.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Yes. I mean, Microsoft lets you. Come on, Sony. Who are you kidding, fam? Who are you kidding?

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:26.000
You can't ride the Spider-Man train forever.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:30.000
I know. All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go. Have a good one. Thank you for the call, though.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:33.000
Hey, no problem. You take care, bros. You too. Bye.

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:37.000
And I think with that, I am going to go ahead and wrap up. I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:42.000
But remember, you can always email us. Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com and I would definitely encourage you to do that.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:47.000
But we are going to wrap up here in studio tonight. That was a fun show. Thank you, Loki, as always, for being here.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.000
And thank you, listeners, as always, for being here.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Because again, we do tape live on Sunday nights at the Voice Heats Network, vognetwork.com.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:58.000
But I know many of you listen to us through our podcast feed and we are very thankful for that.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:03.000
Because the live experience is going to be changing very, very soon. I would say within the next six weeks.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
We're going to be making that big move to Twitch.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:09.000
And for those of you on the podcast feed, though, nothing's going to change. So don't worry about it.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:14.000
Just maybe the audio will kind of sound a little different because we'll be recording it a little differently, hopefully on some newer equipment.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:19.000
And then we are going to be making a hosting change behind the scenes. But again, all that shouldn't really affect you guys.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:22.000
We do appreciate you guys listening to our show every week and supporting Orange Launch Radio.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:29.000
Thank you, as always. Whether you've been listening for all 15, 16 years or you just started listening last week, we appreciate you being here.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Please help us spread the word. Tell a friend or two about our show.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:39.000
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only air the voices that are here to basically be aired.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:43.000
So that's that. Now we'll get everybody's final thought.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Oh, I always say a quick five star review on a place like iTunes and all that goes a long way.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.000
I've said that enough and we never seem to get new ones anyway.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:53.000
But I'll say it again because you never know. Maybe this will be the week.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Anyway, final thoughts time. It's time to get everybody's final thought.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
Loki, you want to go first? What's your final thought tonight?

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:05.000
I forgot to mention, well, I looked at this earlier this week, but Humble Bundle right now has another PlayStation 4 deal that's coming right now.

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Oh, I didn't know that.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
THQ games, so if you're interested in that.

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Giana Sisters could be had for a dollar and Lock's Quest.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:15.000
Oh, shit. Well, Giana Sisters, they gave away on the Xbox Gold a while ago.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Right.

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
But, I mean, for charity, for a dollar.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Yeah, really.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:27.000
You know, they have This Is The Police, The Dwarves, Red Faction 2, Black Mirror, and Destroy All Humans 2 for $12.28, which is the BP average and $15.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Titan Quest, Darksiders, War Master Edition, Cinamori, EXEN, Battle Chasers, Night War.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:36.000
That's a lot of stuff. That's a lot of games.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Yeah, a lot of games.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.000
I like my deals.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
I think I have a lot of these already, though.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.000
We'll see.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:42.000
That's it.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Alright.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:49.000
And then my final thought is, so I didn't talk about this during my gaming week, but you know I play those online reality games.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
I was playing another one recently.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Guess what? Guess what, Loki? Guess what?

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
I was playing a Big Brother one online. Guess what happened?

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.000
You got voted out?

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
You got voted out before the jury again.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:04.000
I'm the biggest flop in these things, but yet I still continue to play.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Alright, anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Challenge Radio.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show and supporting it.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:12.000
We appreciate you guys.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
And we will see you next time, next week.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:15.000
We'll do it all again next week, right?

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Next week's show is going to have to last us two weeks, though, so we've got to make it extra good.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:21.000
So we'll see you here in seven days to do it all over again.

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:22.000
Thank you again for listening.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Have a great week.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:24.000
Happy gaming.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:28.000
