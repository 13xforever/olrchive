0	17440	This week, Sony made waves by announcing its retreat from events, but speculation is
17440	19760	that they're saving money, time, and effort in a quieter year.
19760	21360	They'll be back, it's only inevitable.
21360	24200	That's just one story to catch up on, join us for plenty more news from around the gaming
24200	29960	universe starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
29960	35520	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
35520	36800	every gamer has a voice.
36800	44040	It's Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight, episode number 753 for this November the 25th of 2018.
44040	47360	My name, Rob Roberts, and his name, Techmaster Loki.
47360	48360	Hello.
48360	49360	Hi, how are you?
49360	50360	I'm fine.
50360	51360	We are back after a week off.
51360	52840	We weren't here last week, and that was my bad.
52840	54480	I'll get to that in a minute.
54480	57640	Not joining us in studio tonight, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
57640	59120	She is still on work leave.
59120	62480	Unfortunately for a little while longer, but she'll be joining us live in studio December
62480	66960	9th, I think is the day she'll be here, which may be on the current trajectory I'm planning.
66960	70040	I think December 9th is going to be our last shoutcast show.
70040	74600	If you haven't already heard the news, our live show is going to move over to Twitch.
74600	76260	Nothing will change with the podcast.
76260	77960	It will still be a podcast feed as it always was.
77960	82180	In fact, I was reminded while we were doing our call with Bobby tonight earlier, we've
82180	83240	kind of done this before.
83240	87320	We used to be on Justin TV back in the day, and apparently somebody in our chat room over
87320	90500	at live.vognetwork.com dug up some old highlights.
90500	95420	So if you want to see like 2008 video clips of OLR, our old Twitch TV channel, Orange
95420	96420	Lounge Radio.
96420	97420	We didn't have a camera though.
97420	98420	No, we did.
98420	99420	Did we?
99420	100420	Oh yeah.
100420	101420	You forgot.
101420	102420	Yeah.
102420	105800	Remember the house I used to live at with John, with the lights, the Christmas lights
105800	107800	in the garage?
107800	108800	That was on video.
108800	110640	Remember you played the Final Fantasy 13 demo?
110640	113720	Yeah, but I thought we had that, just that was the video.
113720	115260	No, there was both.
115260	118660	Because remember I had that camera, that blue tiny little camera?
118660	119660	Yeah.
119660	120660	That thing broke by the way.
120660	121660	That's long gone.
121660	124520	That's when I was doing those vlogs on YouTube for a little while.
124520	126280	That's another project that's long gone.
126280	127340	So anyway, yeah.
127340	128500	So it's funny.
128500	133340	What's old is new again, but we're going back to the Twitch thing in a few weeks.
133340	136600	So we're targeting December 16th, but don't hold us to that.
136600	138300	But anyway, yeah.
138300	142000	So we're here in studio now doing the podcast the way we always have.
142000	146160	And by the way, I do want to emphasize, it's still going to be Orange Lounge Radio even
146160	147160	after we move.
147160	150920	It's just going to be, yes, there will be some, you'll get to see us doing a radio show,
150920	151920	but it is still a radio show.
151920	154600	So I don't want our people that listen to us on their commutes.
154600	159240	And I know we have data entry during the day, people and other tech jobs where they just
159240	163440	listen to us in the earbuds while they play, or while they play, while they work, maybe
163440	165120	play, and do that.
165120	170300	And I just, for you guys, it's not going to change, but it is kind of a big change for
170300	172020	us and an exciting one as well.
172020	177300	But honestly, I've joked time and time again, this computer that we do the show on is still
177300	179220	running Windows XP.
179220	185380	So this technology is circa like 2006, 2007, and it's just, it's time to modernize a little
185380	186380	bit.
186380	188980	So it's going to be really exciting and hopefully get us some new folks here at Orange Lounge
188980	189980	Radio.
189980	190980	Really excited.
190980	192220	So let's talk about video games.
192220	195160	We are going to get it in the news in just a little bit.
195160	198420	And we are going to cover, because it was the Thanksgiving holiday in the States this
198420	202540	week, which I hope you all had an awesome Thanksgiving and all that good stuff.
202540	205540	Those of you in the States anyway, if you're in other countries, you probably was just
205540	209160	another week for you, but I hope you had a good week nonetheless.
209160	212740	But since it was the Thanksgiving holiday in the States, there probably wasn't as much
212740	213740	gaming news this week.
213740	214740	There was a little bit.
214740	215740	We'll get into that.
215740	218820	But we're going to kind of combine the week we missed last week and touch on some of the
218820	223120	big headlines from last week, because there's, Loki, there's some big stuff that happened
223120	225400	last week that we've got to give our insight on.
225400	228480	Like this whole E3 change.
228480	229480	We'll get to that later.
229480	230480	Yeah.
230480	231480	Yeah.
231480	232480	That's interesting.
232480	233480	Anyway.
233480	235560	But to start off the show tonight, let me tell you about why I wasn't here last week.
235560	241760	So I was in Las Vegas and I was attending Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival in Las Vegas,
241760	244880	which was at the Rio Hotel, which is just off the strip.
244880	247080	About 5,000 people going to this event.
247080	253080	I'm guessing that number based off the raffle ticket numbers that ran from zero to 5,000.
253080	255720	That's why I'm assuming there's about 5,000 people.
255720	260120	Maybe you add in some press and things like that too is maybe like 5,500, but about 5,000
260120	267320	people give or take at this convention center at the Rio to celebrate Final Fantasy XIV,
267320	271040	which is of course the online Final Fantasy game.
271040	275240	There is an older online Final Fantasy game, Final Fantasy XI, but that game, they kind
275240	278440	of stopped doing expansions and all that for a little while ago.
278440	280240	They're doing more minor updates with that game.
280240	284200	I think there's a much larger player base on Final Fantasy XIV because it is the newer
284200	285200	one.
285200	287880	It is the game that's on PlayStation 4 as well as PC.
287880	290560	And so this was really to celebrate that game.
290560	292160	And they did do the new expansion.
292160	294240	So I was out there in the audience during the keynote.
294240	297400	If you guys were watching on Twitch, I think there actually was a moment you probably could
297400	299440	have seen me on camera, which would have had to know where to look.
299440	303440	And I don't, I always find my reactions and those crowd shots really weird.
303440	305240	So I usually try to look away anyway.
305240	308120	But I was there when they unveiled the brand new expansion.
308120	311320	Shadowbringers is the new expansion that they're doing for Final Fantasy XIV.
311320	316520	I keep wanting to call it Stormbringers because the current expansion is Stormblood.
316520	320040	And for some reason, it's another SB acronym.
320040	324800	So you have Stormblood is the current expansion and Shadowbringers is the new one.
324800	326120	The first one was Heavensward.
326120	329400	So it was nothing SB, but it's weird that both acronyms are SB.
329400	330400	So I keep wanting to say Stormbringers.
330400	331400	Heavens...
331400	332400	I don't know.
332400	333400	Yeah.
333400	334400	Heavensbringer.
334400	335400	Yeah.
335400	336400	Heavensworb.
336400	337400	So that's the new expansion.
337400	343080	And with that, they announced the Blue Mage job is going to be a part of actually Stormblood.
343080	346160	It's going to be in the next patch, a little bit controversial.
346160	350160	This Blue Mage implementation, because they're not implementing it like a normal job.
350160	354920	They are going to be doing kind of like a special little, I guess, side events that
354920	357900	you do more in a solo manner.
357900	360100	And it's going to be capped at level 50.
360100	365720	And you can do this whole like mass carnival up to, you know, level like 50 events and
365720	366720	things.
366720	368400	You go out in the field and learn spells.
368400	372760	Apparently you can do things in small groups like up to level 50, but what they're trying
372760	377640	to do is they're trying to keep Blue Mage out of current rating and the current meta
377640	378840	and out of progression.
378840	382040	And that's a very controversial change because there's some people out there that were very
382040	385600	much looking forward to Blue Mage and being able to play that in the progression.
385600	390520	So it's kind of like you get this kind of like awkward implementation of the Blue Mage
390520	391520	job.
391520	394480	And so it's rubbing some people the wrong way.
394480	399920	For me, I guess we're lucky it's there at all in a way, but I'll give it a chance.
399920	400920	I'll check it out.
400920	402120	I think I'll change that once the other expansion comes out.
402120	403120	See, and that's the thing.
403120	404120	They could.
404120	409640	Maybe if the Rabble Rabble is really great and, you know, they could always retinker
409640	414740	it to allow Blue Mage to just cap up to level 80, which will be the new level cap, and be
414740	417300	in the progression content and maybe limit the skills.
417300	419560	I think they're really worried about balancing.
419560	423720	And they were really worried about Blue Mages getting rejected from parties because they
423720	429000	don't know all the spells because there's going to be, they said, 49 spells you go out
429000	430360	and absorb from monsters.
430360	432340	That's the whole thing with Blue Mage, by the way, if you weren't familiar in Final
432340	438000	Fantasy lore, like in games like Final Fantasy V, you would learn spells as a Blue Mage by
438000	441720	fighting the monsters and getting it cast on you basically.
441720	445600	And then you may learn the spell and they're kind of implementing it that way in Final
445600	446600	Fantasy XIV.
446600	449140	Except I don't think, I think you just have to fight the mob.
449140	452560	You don't necessarily have to have the spell cast on you, but still, you know, relatively
452560	453560	close.
453600	454600	Interesting implementation.
454600	455640	We'll see where they go with that.
455640	456640	I think it's very interesting.
456640	459240	It is not a part of the expansion.
459240	460580	It's part of this expansion.
460580	462240	So it's something that's leading into the next expansion.
462240	464240	So it's in the new expansion.
464240	467720	Yes, there will be more jobs in the new expansion.
467720	469680	They didn't say what those are.
469680	474460	There's a leak that called this Blue Mage thing and some other things.
474460	477440	So if you want to believe the leak, there's going to be two more jobs.
477440	481340	I'll let you go find that for yourself if you want to go look it up.
481460	484620	The other big thing that they teased, I'm very happy about this.
484620	490020	So in years past at this event, Yoshida, who's the producer and director of XIV, he wears
490020	494060	a t-shirt that will tease something about the expansion.
494060	500220	So a couple of years ago, he wore a Batman t-shirt and at the next Fan Fest, Dark Knight
500220	501220	was a job.
501220	502220	Get it?
502220	508260	So then last time he wore a Scarlet Witch t-shirt and guess what got announced at the
508260	509260	next Fan Fest?
509260	510260	Red Mage, right?
510260	511260	Get it?
511260	517340	So this time he wore a Bugs Bunny shirt and he pointed at it when he was talking about
517340	518740	the new race.
518740	523500	Although he wouldn't say what the new race was, but it's pretty much saying without saying
523500	529860	that the Viera from Final Fantasy XII will pretty much certainly be the new race in Final
529860	530860	Fantasy XIV.
530860	534700	It's just not totally confirmed yet, but what other bunny races are out there and it's,
534700	536540	I mean, I'm super happy.
536540	538900	Like obviously like Fran is one of my all time favorite Final Fantasy characters.
538900	542780	What he means to tell you is Space Jam is coming to you.
542780	548180	I would be okay with that actually if that, you know, Final Fantasy XIV in Space Jam.
548180	549180	Exactly.
549180	552020	It's like, all right, cool.
552020	556060	Now one of the other big things they announced in the keynote was this trust system.
556060	560180	So you're going to be able to, and Final Fantasy XI has this, they implemented it way later
560180	563380	when the game was dying off and it was harder to find parties.
563380	568260	What they did is they made it so that you could have NPCs in your party basically, and
568260	570620	they would function like normal party members.
570620	574740	They're bringing that system to Final Fantasy XIV, but they're not doing it because Final
574740	576060	Fantasy XIV is dying off.
576060	578220	At least they're certainly not going to admit that's the case.
578220	580240	And I don't think the game is.
580240	586780	They're doing it because, this is really interesting, they realize that there are some people that
586780	593780	although they want to play an MMO with friends, the story makes you do like dungeons and group
593780	595940	content to progress in the story.
595940	600140	Some people don't want to do the group content because they feel like if they're not pulling
600140	601980	their weight, they're holding the group back.
601980	605740	And it kind of gives that whole like anxiety of, you know, I'm playing with other people
605740	608320	and they are relying on me and I don't want to fuck up.
608320	613460	So basically they're going to allow you to do, use these trusts to help you get through
613460	616140	the story and do content without other people.
616140	620660	And it's, it's very strange because that was kind of a theme between that and the Bloom
620660	621820	Age experience.
621820	626940	I kind of felt like a theme I was hearing about this expansion was, here is an MMO you
626940	629500	can play all by yourself.
629500	631580	And I thought that was just very interesting.
631580	637220	But I totally recognize, and I've even been in this position before that sometimes you
637220	640480	don't necessarily want to play with other people.
640480	645660	You just want to be in the experience at the same time other people are experiencing it.
645660	647960	So you can talk about that or life or whatever.
647960	651680	It's a chat room with fire spells and great swords.
651680	652800	That's what it is.
652800	655420	That's what the MMO world is to some people.
655420	656780	And that's totally fine.
656780	662240	So I think it's very interesting that you have Final Fantasy XIV kind of embracing the
662240	664400	solo experience in an MMO.
664400	665400	What do you think?
665400	668360	I know you don't play a lot of MMOs currently, Loki, but you spend a lot of time with Final
668360	669800	Fantasy XI and so forth.
669800	671480	I know you've dabbled in a few of them.
671480	674220	What do you think about like the solo experience in MMO?
674220	677240	Like do you think MMOs should be built to play alone?
677240	678240	Sure.
678240	681600	I like playing Final Fantasy XI alone.
681600	682600	Yeah.
682600	683600	Sometimes.
683600	689320	Unless I was up against a roadblock that I needed to have a party, like any sort of experience.
689320	691720	You get the trusts and you don't need that anymore.
691720	692720	Granted.
692720	693720	Interesting.
693720	697080	I didn't really have that problem when I was playing on that not so legit server where
697080	702160	the XP boost was like times 10 and that was awesome because then I could solo all the
702160	704680	way up to whatever I need to.
704680	707680	Let's go to our chat room for some feedback on this because we do tape live every Sunday
707680	712400	night at the voice of geeks network, vognetwork.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night
712400	716000	at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
716000	719600	And you can join us in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
719600	722560	But I do want to start plugging away here when I mention it because, you know, I mentioned
722560	725520	this at the top of every show, but I do want to start mentioning if you aren't already
725520	731040	following the network on Twitch TV, you might want to get over there and get on that vognetwork
731040	735920	over on Twitch TV because that is where we're going to be in the future in about a month
735920	737200	if all things stay on track.
737360	740320	Anyway, some of the comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
740320	743440	Dungeon Buster says, this is a nice gesture for 14.
743440	746800	Pugs can either be awesome experiences or toxic nightmares.
747360	751920	It's super nice to drop into a group of nice players, but getting toxic ones can ruin your
751920	752320	night.
752320	753600	And that's exactly right.
754320	758560	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I can still optionally play with friends.
758560	762480	I hated having to be like, hey, Free Company, while you're out there playing Moogle Mog,
762480	765520	can you help me with this four person dungeon way beneath you?
765520	769280	Yeah, like maybe some people, you know, they want to be able to do the old stuff without
769280	772240	having to ask people to run through it with them.
772240	774880	So yeah, it's something that trust is going to open up.
774880	776240	It's gonna be very interesting.
776240	779920	So anyway, you know, I'm sure a lot of the announcements have been online.
779920	782800	I don't want to, I don't want to retread that territory too much.
782800	785920	So what else happened at this event besides the keynote?
785920	787920	Well, they did a variety of panels.
787920	792080	So they did some panels talking about the next patch that's going to include Blue Mage.
792080	793920	They went into detail on Blue Mage.
793920	798640	They did like a PvP tournament there, which I'm not super into PvP and 14.
798640	801920	So it wasn't really something that was up my alley, but I know it is for some people.
801920	802720	So that was cool.
802720	804480	They did a big costume contest.
804480	808480	And let me tell you, the cosplay was like Dragon Con level good.
808480	812720	Like Final Fantasy 14 cosplayers go all out and there was some really good stuff.
813360	815120	So that was really cool to see.
815120	818080	And they do like lore panels and all that stuff as well.
818080	821200	While that's going on, it was interesting because this year they had it split.
821200	823600	They had the very large room was kind of like their panel room.
823600	825120	And they had some events in there.
826000	827520	I can't remember if I posted this on Twitter,
827520	831440	but I took a picture of myself in front of this giant makeshift aetheryte crystal,
831440	834960	which is like a home crystal doing the little pose like I'm tuning to the crystal.
835920	838320	So that is something that they had like in that room.
838320	841360	And they had like some little silly carnival games that you could win,
841360	845200	like posters and stickers and, you know, very silly things for playing.
845200	846480	So that was kind of neat.
846480	851600	But then inside rooms, of course, they had one room that was all about playing Final Fantasy 14.
851600	859040	And you could stand in line to do a new primal fight, Yojimbo as a primal fight,
859040	863040	which Yojimbo is actually already, I mean, Yojimbo is already in Final Fantasy 10.
863040	863840	That's where he comes from.
863840	869200	But Yojimbo is already a dungeon boss, but they redid him for a primal fight.
869200	871440	And all I'm going to say about it, I'm not going to spoil it.
871440	873200	It's not the same as the dungeon fight.
873200	876400	It's very, very different because there's a big twist at the beginning of the fight.
876400	879200	You're not really fighting Yojimbo, you're fighting somebody else.
879200	881760	So that's all I'm going to say about that fight.
884160	889040	And then, let's see, you could do one of the existing primal fights,
889040	891360	which is basically, you know, eight people taking on a boss.
891360	896080	But they would have various modifiers, like the bottom half of your screen is unusable,
896080	897840	or it's covered up entirely, basically,
897840	900400	which kind of sucks because that's where your skills and actions are.
901200	906160	Or other silly modifiers like, you know, you could only use certain type of weapons,
906160	909920	or it was sped up, or, you know, like half health or something.
909920	912960	Like there'd be all these different modifiers, so that was something you could,
912960	915920	I think maybe one was that the bosses didn't telegraph any moves.
915920	916960	That's pretty horrible too.
917840	920400	So yeah, there was, you could play the hard stuff.
920400	922960	There was some type of like Eureka challenge where you kind of,
922960	927040	so they basically had like different little like sub games within the game
927040	929760	that it uses the game's engine and the game's setup,
929760	933840	but they're not really things that you can do in the game right now at home.
933840	936800	So it's kind of neat that they have, you know, that whole thing set up.
936800	938880	And then, of course, they had a big old merchandise booth
938880	940720	and they were selling a lot of that stuff.
940720	944880	And, you know, I know this festival for a lot of people is a chance to meet up with
944880	948400	free company members or guild members and people that they play the game with.
949280	950720	I met a lot of new people.
950720	952960	I had a good time meeting some new people that played the game
953760	956560	and reconnecting with people that I used to play with.
956560	959360	Like one of my old buddies that I played with back on McGarsimer was there.
960080	961680	And so it was really cool to reconnect with him.
961680	967120	And yeah, just, you know, it's about kind of the community as well as the game.
967120	975040	So that was what I kind of, I guess, skipped the show to see last week.
975680	978880	Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
980320	983760	Oh, I guess Shane joined our chat room or somebody that knows him very well
983760	986720	because the nickname is Shane Hates 14 Bloom Age.
986720	989440	Yeah, I know he wasn't too happy with the implementation of that.
990000	994960	Says in our chat says, despite some information that made people matter upset overall,
994960	998080	the con was the best they've done for North America so far.
998080	1002480	Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up because I will say that is that the last two times I went,
1002480	1007280	so they've done this every other year in the even numbered years to announce their other expansions
1007280	1011440	and 2014 with Heaven's Word, like the registration line was very long.
1011440	1013360	The merchandise line was a nightmare.
1013360	1015680	2016 had some issues as well.
1015680	1020960	So like this year organization, I will give kudos to Square Enix, was done very well.
1020960	1023360	There was no line for registration.
1023360	1024960	Like not you walked right up.
1024960	1028400	They scanned your code. You got your packet. You got your backpack.
1028400	1032000	I don't know if you saw that when he came in, but I got a little Final Fantasy 14 backpack
1032000	1034160	and it had like loot inside it. So it's kind of nice.
1034160	1035680	You just walked right in and pick that up.
1036720	1039680	Even though they, this was the first year because of, you know,
1039680	1044960	incidents that have happened in Las Vegas in the not too distant, you know,
1044960	1046000	past and so forth.
1046000	1048800	They had metal detectors for the first time that we all had to go through on the way in.
1048800	1051280	And when I read that they were going to do that, I was like, oh God,
1051280	1053600	that line to get in is going to be a mile long.
1053600	1055680	It wasn't. I was pleasantly surprised.
1055680	1058080	We moved right along into that thing.
1058080	1062480	They got us through that nice and early to put us in a queue room in the back.
1062480	1065280	So that way the metal detectors weren't a choke point
1065280	1067840	because people were lining up as early as like 5, 6 a.m.
1067840	1071920	I know Shane went out there really, really early the day of the keynote.
1072560	1075760	And so that was nice that the metal detectors didn't become a bottleneck.
1075760	1079360	So, and they did the merchandise sales in advance online.
1079360	1082880	So you have to stand in line all day just to decide what you wanted at the merch booth.
1082880	1087360	So honestly, they just did a lot of things that made it feel a lot smoother.
1087360	1090240	But at the same time, because all of it was so smooth,
1090240	1095600	you really started to notice the whole like, well, I'm kind of out of things to do.
1095600	1097360	There's no panel right now.
1097360	1099680	I've done the Yojimbo fight and all this other stuff.
1100160	1104800	And the thing about Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest is that's all it is,
1104800	1106320	is Final Fantasy XIV stuff.
1106320	1107120	But here's the thing.
1108080	1110320	So you realize you're out of things to do.
1110320	1113680	That's the time that you go hang out with your free company
1113680	1117360	or you meet some new people and hang out with them and so forth.
1117360	1120800	So that's part of the whole experience, I suppose.
1120800	1124320	Talking about being in the same place and existing at the same time.
1125200	1128640	We're talking about like the solo experience in an MMO and so forth.
1128640	1129440	So yeah.
1130640	1132800	Okay, now I know it's Shane because he knows this.
1132800	1136720	He says in chat, Rob got stopped every time at the metal detector.
1136720	1137760	Take that how you will.
1137760	1138480	Yes, that's true.
1138480	1142640	I set that metal detector off every single stinking time.
1142640	1144800	And it wasn't my belt.
1144800	1145680	It wasn't my watch.
1145680	1146320	I don't know what it is.
1146320	1148320	But every single time I was setting off that metal detector.
1148320	1149760	And they'd have to do the whole wand.
1149760	1151520	And of course, they don't find anything with a wand.
1151520	1152320	So I don't know what it is.
1152320	1153680	It's my magnetic personality.
1154240	1155440	No, I don't know what was setting it off.
1155440	1156320	It was weird.
1156320	1158240	Anyway, let's see.
1158240	1161760	Looking at other comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1162960	1165280	Shane is also reminding me to talk about the data centers.
1165280	1166240	So yeah, with...
1166240	1167280	And this is the last thing we'll talk about,
1167280	1169360	because then I want to move on with some of the other headlines from the week.
1170800	1174720	But one of the other really controversial things they're doing with Final Fantasy XIV,
1174720	1176880	and I'm going to just flat out say one of the things I don't like.
1177440	1180720	I know Shane is really pissed off about this blue mage thing.
1180720	1184080	But honestly, with the blue mage thing, I'm like,
1184080	1187680	all right, it's there and they can always fix it later.
1187680	1192080	But this is the thing where I'm like, ugh, I wish they hadn't done this.
1192080	1193280	But I understand why they're doing it.
1193280	1197040	So what they're doing is they're making a third data center in North America.
1197040	1198640	There's already two data centers.
1198640	1199920	They're making a third.
1199920	1205200	And here's the thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can do cross data center.
1205920	1208240	But it's not like World of Warcraft,
1208240	1210960	where admittedly in the early days of World of Warcraft,
1210960	1212880	you could only do things on one server.
1212880	1214800	But about three or four expansions in,
1214800	1217120	they made it so that it didn't matter what server you were on.
1217120	1220080	You could party up with people on any other server and so forth.
1220080	1224000	In Final Fantasy XIV, you're still limited by your data center.
1224000	1226720	So sure, you can transfer between servers,
1226720	1229120	but it has to be servers on your data center.
1229120	1232160	And now in the new expansions in Shadowbringers,
1232160	1234080	they're going to do this whole world,
1234080	1236320	or actually, no, I think this is part of the 4.5 patch.
1236320	1238640	You can even go visit another server,
1238640	1240960	but it still has to be within the data center.
1240960	1245840	So there is still this big wall because my friends that I used to play with
1245920	1248800	are on Midgarcimer, which is one data center,
1248800	1251200	and I'm on the other one now, Hyperion.
1251200	1252320	So there's still this wall.
1252320	1255040	I can't play with the people I used to play with because we're still on this.
1255040	1257200	And the problem is, in the new expansion,
1257200	1259280	they're going to be adding a third data center.
1259280	1260880	So now there's going to be two walls.
1260880	1263680	And they took the most populated server, Bao Mung,
1263680	1266560	which there's a lot of inside jokes about Bao Mung and the role play,
1266560	1269760	and it's going to the third server with a bunch of low pop servers.
1269760	1271760	So all these people are having to,
1272640	1276240	if they have a cross-server group that's on a data center,
1276240	1279120	it might be getting split up because of this change.
1279120	1282080	But that was also kind of the nice thing about having some downtime,
1282080	1283760	is that you kind of start to ask people,
1283760	1285040	so what's your server?
1285040	1287040	Oh, you're going to be on the new one with me.
1287040	1289920	OK, so we should talk more because maybe we'll be able to group up.
1289920	1293600	It's like people are suddenly finding their new homes and things like that.
1293600	1295840	It's like Final Fantasy XI all over again.
1295840	1297120	Yeah, yeah, a little bit.
1297120	1301920	So it's unfortunate about the whole data center thing,
1301920	1304240	and I really hope in the near future
1305040	1308400	they can really figure out how to take down those walls of the data center.
1308400	1311200	But I feel like it's one of those things that they're kind of,
1312240	1314800	I feel like it's one of those things they're kind of trapped in.
1314800	1317600	They're kind of trapped into it because of the way the game was built.
1317600	1321120	Because remember, Final Fantasy XIV had a horrible first version,
1321120	1323920	and they've been trying to fix it ever since, basically.
1323920	1326960	So I just have this weird feeling they're kind of screwed in from that,
1326960	1328240	but we'll see, we'll see.
1328240	1330240	Anyway, that's enough about Fan Fest.
1330240	1333280	Is there anything else I should be saying about Fan Fest, Loki?
1335280	1338400	Any news on Final Fantasy XI Mobile that was supposed to be...
1338400	1340080	No, this is only a XIV.
1340720	1343120	No news on anything else but Final Fantasy XIV.
1343120	1344640	That's about XIV right now.
1344640	1345440	Yeah, right.
1345440	1350240	Until it goes like, you know, monthly fee free, then maybe.
1350880	1354080	Okay, so Bobby Blackwolf in chat, let me explain this better.
1354080	1357920	Bobby says, oh, so I can't transfer my character over to the server you're on?
1357920	1364080	So as a kind of like, sorry, we're screwing up all your like pre-mades and stuff.
1364080	1366800	What they're doing is they're saying for a two-week period,
1366800	1369760	we are going to offer free server transfers.
1369760	1373200	So when they create this third data center, it's going to be,
1373200	1376320	it is going to be a nut house because everybody's going to use this opportunity
1376320	1379920	of free data transfers to go to where they want to go.
1380720	1383680	Now, once you've figured out what server you're going to be on,
1383680	1386400	Final Fantasy is also implementing this.
1386400	1390400	You can temporarily visit other servers within the data center.
1391040	1392400	You can just kind of do that within game,
1392400	1397120	but you'll be locked into that data center once the free move period is over.
1397120	1399040	So I hope that makes sense because right now,
1399040	1402640	you can move a character to any server you want for like 15, 18 bucks.
1402640	1403280	I don't know what it is.
1403280	1404640	I don't remember what it was I paid,
1404640	1406800	but they're going to open that up and make it free for two weeks
1406800	1410320	as their apology to, sorry, we're doing this big shuffle.
1410320	1411680	We feel bad about it.
1411680	1413440	So here's your chance to re-pick.
1413440	1415280	It's going to screw up a lot of housing stuff
1415280	1417280	because some people have invested a lot of gill in housing,
1417280	1419760	but they're trying, they're talking about reimbursements,
1419760	1420400	like 3 million.
1421040	1422640	They're trying to, they're trying to sweeten the pot.
1422640	1424000	I just, I don't know.
1424000	1425120	It's going to be, it's going to be a lot.
1425120	1428560	So I may not stay where I am, Bobby.
1428560	1429360	I will let you know.
1429360	1431040	I will let everybody, I'll tweet about it.
1431040	1432400	What world I decide to go to.
1432400	1435600	I honestly have not decided yet.
1436800	1438320	There's just so many factors.
1438320	1440080	I really have to kind of figure out
1440880	1444080	where are the people actually going to be playing regularly?
1444080	1447520	Because I've kind of hit a ghost town experience
1447520	1450480	on my old server and I've hit a ghost town experience
1450480	1451920	on my new server.
1451920	1453440	So I'll stay on the new server
1453440	1455120	if it's not going to be a ghost town anymore.
1455120	1456320	I'll go back to the old server
1456320	1458000	if it's not going to be a ghost town anymore.
1458000	1460000	I'll go to a third server, a brand new server,
1460000	1462000	if I find out there's a great community here
1462000	1465280	that, you know, wants to have Rob there and do stuff.
1465280	1467920	So I honestly don't have the answer to that question yet.
1467920	1471200	And I think a lot of that will start to sort itself out
1471200	1473920	when they announce the date of the server transfers.
1473920	1477120	So I'm just not totally focused on that right now
1477120	1480400	because, you know, patch 4.5 is still not even out
1480400	1481120	until January.
1481120	1483280	So the game is still a little bit stagnant until January.
1483280	1485760	It's why I've been playing, even though I'm subscribed to 14,
1485760	1487840	it's why I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft
1487840	1488800	in between there.
1488800	1491920	So anyway, let's see.
1492400	1494800	Hopefully I explained that a little better.
1497120	1498320	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
1498320	1500080	I'm also okay with starting from level one
1500080	1501520	because I forget how to play,
1501520	1503920	especially if you can access trust from the beginning.
1503920	1507360	Well, remember, Bobby, you can also just roll a new job
1507360	1509040	and you'll have to start it from level one.
1509040	1510080	And that could be another way
1510080	1512320	because maybe one of these new jobs will speak to you too.
1512320	1513280	Who knows?
1513280	1515120	So, you know, you got a lot of options.
1515120	1516080	So something to think about.
1517040	1518480	They haven't talked about how the trust
1518480	1519440	is going to be implemented.
1519440	1521360	So we'll see what happens with that.
1522000	1522800	All right.
1522800	1524720	I think that's all I want to say about Final Fantasy XIV
1524720	1526400	because I know not everybody plays the MMO
1526400	1527440	and I've talked at length about it.
1527440	1528720	We have plenty more news to get to
1529280	1530960	that has come up in the past couple of weeks.
1531520	1532400	Before we get to that, though,
1532400	1533760	let's talk about our gaming weeks
1533760	1535920	and the types of video games that we have been playing
1535920	1538160	these past couple of weeks while we've been out.
1538160	1539440	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1539440	1540720	My gaming week was all right.
1540720	1542160	I didn't play a whole ton of things,
1542160	1545280	but I did play a few things.
1545280	1548560	So I got around finally to pick,
1548560	1550400	I mentioned I was going to be picking up
1552320	1554240	Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu.
1554240	1556560	So I picked that up and I bought that
1556560	1557760	and I've been playing that quite a bit.
1557760	1559200	I'm like 20 hours into it.
1559200	1561600	I've already taken down five gyms
1561600	1563920	and I've gotten all the way to Fuchsia City.
1564560	1565120	Wow.
1565120	1567440	Where I've got my Pokemon Go Park stuff.
1567440	1569600	So it's great because, you know, it's like,
1569600	1570960	oh yeah, there's all these, you know,
1570960	1573120	version exclusive Pokemon and stuff.
1573120	1574240	I'm like, fuck that.
1574240	1576400	I've got like all this crap just sitting
1576400	1577920	on my Pokemon Go account.
1577920	1579760	I'm just going to throw it on in there.
1579760	1580880	Now, what am I doing with it?
1581280	1583680	Do I really need like 50 different Eevees?
1583680	1584400	No, I don't.
1584960	1586640	So I just put that all in there.
1586640	1588800	So it was great to kind of fill in on that stuff.
1589680	1591040	So right now I have a Pokemon Go Park
1591040	1592400	that's just full of like Pokemon.
1592400	1594960	You can actually have, I think you transfer
1594960	1596960	up to a thousand Pokemon into that.
1596960	1599280	So like I'm set for a while.
1599280	1600080	I should be good.
1600080	1601840	But I still have to catch everything
1601840	1603120	because I've ran out of berries.
1603120	1604560	That's kind of the annoying thing too.
1604560	1605760	It's like, hey, you know,
1605760	1607200	whereas like in Pokemon Go,
1607200	1608560	I have all these berries.
1608560	1610720	I'm literally like swimming in berries
1610720	1612080	in Pokemon Let's Go.
1612080	1613760	You can't fucking find those anywhere.
1613760	1614880	You have to keep catching things
1614880	1616000	and you sometimes get them
1616000	1617600	or you get them as bonuses for other things,
1617600	1620240	but you can't buy them, which is annoying.
1620240	1621920	Walk the Pokemon because you get.
1621920	1624000	I know, I know I do.
1624000	1625440	I was doing that.
1625440	1627360	And then the problem is those
1627360	1628960	I have to keep transferring it back.
1628960	1630640	And I don't, I keep switching
1630640	1633280	in between which Pokemon I want to level
1633280	1634560	up because I'm trying to figure out
1635520	1637200	what's going to be the best to have
1637200	1638320	against the final four.
1639280	1639920	So I don't know.
1640720	1643360	But I've been playing that quite a bit.
1643360	1644480	And it's been fun.
1644480	1646240	I've been a little bit grindy though,
1646240	1649040	but just, I found that trading
1649040	1651520	with randoms is also kind of working out too.
1651520	1653120	I didn't even realize that this was a thing.
1653120	1654240	So you just put in like,
1654240	1656240	cause the trading's weird.
1656240	1657520	You don't like, you don't go
1657520	1658960	to your friends list or anything
1658960	1660240	like you would in the other games.
1660240	1661280	You just basically say,
1661280	1663040	so you connect online and then you say,
1663040	1665680	put in a three, it's not even digit.
1665680	1667200	It's a three picture code.
1667200	1668800	It's just like, if you've played the rating
1668800	1670240	in Pokemon Go and done a private raid,
1670320	1670960	it's just like that.
1670960	1672240	But you're on the entire internet.
1672240	1673920	But there's a universal code
1673920	1674720	that everybody's using,
1674720	1676560	which is Pikachu, Pikachu, Pikachu.
1676560	1677840	It's the first one.
1677840	1678560	And if you do that,
1678560	1680560	you'll get matched up with some random person.
1680560	1681920	And so that's why it is like,
1681920	1683360	I was like, well, let me just check this out
1683360	1683920	and see whatever.
1683920	1685440	So I did it and then I was like,
1685440	1686320	okay, I'm going to give you,
1686320	1688400	cause I just caught a bunch of slow pokes.
1688400	1692320	I'm going to give you like a level 38 slow poke.
1692320	1693440	And so I did that and they,
1693440	1694800	oh, here, here's the Clefairy.
1694800	1696000	I'm like, all right, that's cool.
1696000	1696400	Whatever.
1696400	1697840	I don't really care what I get.
1697840	1699840	But the Clefairy they got was like level 53.
1700240	1702320	Fuck yeah, I'm going to do this some more.
1703840	1705520	I've been doing the planned trades
1705520	1706640	with my buddy, Justin,
1706640	1708080	that I kind of reconnected with
1708080	1709840	at the Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest.
1709840	1711120	We've been able to do some trading
1711120	1712240	cause he has the Eevee version.
1712240	1713360	I have the Pikachu version.
1713360	1714640	So we've been able to trade
1714640	1715760	some of the exclusives across.
1715760	1717440	And like he texted me the other day
1717440	1719280	because he's like, do you have Graveler?
1719280	1720960	He's like in the exact same spot in the game I am.
1720960	1722640	So he's like, do you have a Graveler
1722640	1724640	that you want to like trade Graveler for Graveler
1724640	1727280	because some of the Pokemon evolve by trading them.
1727280	1729440	So we did Graveler for Graveler.
1729440	1730960	So that way we both got Golems.
1730960	1732080	And then I think we need to do it again
1732800	1734880	for the Kadabras to get Alakazams.
1734880	1736880	So I've been doing the pre-planned trades.
1736880	1738720	I haven't tried the random stuff though, but.
1738720	1740560	I should probably trade those then
1740560	1742080	cause I can't do anything with them
1742080	1742880	if they're just gonna sit there.
1742880	1743920	I'll just trade them.
1743920	1744560	Do you have your Switch?
1744560	1745200	Let's trade.
1745200	1746400	I don't have my Switch with me.
1746400	1747520	I thought about bringing it.
1747520	1748960	I almost did, but I didn't.
1749840	1751040	Next time.
1751040	1752640	Yeah, like Sia Tabiri in chat says
1752640	1753680	grav for grav.
1753680	1754800	Yes, that's exactly what it is.
1754800	1755200	G for G.
1755200	1756800	But yeah, and also it's nice
1756800	1760320	that each of the Pokemon centers
1760320	1762320	they have like people that'll trade you
1762320	1763520	the Alolan Pokemon.
1763520	1764960	So I got an Alolan Marowak,
1764960	1766960	which cause I don't even have that in Pokemon Go.
1766960	1769120	So just too bad because they had one
1769120	1770480	on the gym over here.
1770480	1771920	Just right when I came in.
1771920	1774400	I'm like, oh, there's someone battling him.
1775520	1776160	I can't.
1776160	1777680	Three stars or four stars.
1777680	1778080	Don't.
1778080	1779360	Can't solo that.
1779360	1780320	It's like recommend party.
1780320	1780960	13 people.
1782080	1783360	There's some of the three stars
1783360	1784240	you can do yourself.
1784240	1784800	Yeah, yeah.
1785600	1786320	Anyways.
1786320	1788080	So I've been playing that quite a bit.
1788080	1789360	And then aside from that,
1790000	1790960	you know, Pokemon Go,
1792000	1794720	I did ended up picking up the controller,
1794720	1797200	the Pokeball Plus only because my kids
1797200	1797920	wanted to play with it.
1797920	1800320	My youngest son was like really wanting
1800320	1802080	to play Pokemon and he wanted the ball.
1802080	1805280	So like I picked it up and then my oldest son
1805280	1806800	wanted me to give him Mew.
1807760	1808240	I'm like.
1810160	1812000	But I bought this myself.
1812000	1813600	You know, when you get a job,
1813600	1816160	you can have me up to, you know, I'm like fine.
1816560	1817520	I'll give it to you.
1817520	1819360	Unfortunately, you can't give it to him
1819360	1821440	because he doesn't have a Nintendo account.
1821440	1824000	So sorry, you're out of luck.
1824000	1825200	So I had to transfer Mew over.
1825200	1826880	Mew actually is all right, but.
1828960	1830720	The only positive with Mew is you can give it
1830720	1834400	any of the TMS so you can, you know,
1834400	1836960	kind of customize Mew however you want.
1836960	1838880	Yeah, I have Mew in my party right now,
1838880	1840160	but I'm probably going to take him out.
1840160	1843280	Like I just I need other like harder counters,
1843280	1844160	if that makes sense.
1844160	1845520	Yeah, I need things like
1845520	1846080	ride on.
1846080	1846960	I need things like, you know,
1846960	1848720	that are just like really big.
1848720	1852080	I still haven't been able to get mine to evolve yet.
1852080	1853360	My ride on.
1854720	1855680	I don't know if that's one of the ones
1855680	1857200	you have to trade or if you just it's
1857200	1858320	a higher level when it flips.
1858320	1861120	Whatever, if it doesn't, you know.
1861120	1863360	Just transfer in a Brian once you go.
1863360	1865040	Yeah, like, yeah, seriously.
1865040	1866640	So that's kind of what I've been doing.
1867760	1869600	And then let's see, aside from that.
1871360	1874320	So my DDR machine finally got the replacement
1875200	1877040	optical drive in last week.
1877760	1879360	And sure enough, I put it in there
1879360	1880720	and it doesn't fucking work.
1881280	1884240	So so then there was that problem
1884240	1886080	and it started acting up like I was like,
1886080	1887440	OK, well, what's wrong with this thing?
1887440	1890400	Because it kept popping the tray out a bunch of times
1890400	1892560	and it just was not cooperating.
1892560	1893280	It wouldn't read it.
1893280	1895680	So I ended up having to take the optical drive apart
1895680	1899120	and I fixed it because I guess as they get older,
1899120	1901840	the motors to pop the trays open and stuff like that,
1901840	1903440	they wear out.
1904000	1908320	And so you have to basically break the magnet
1908320	1910080	that's in there a little bit and, you know,
1910080	1914400	tweak it up so that it's higher off of the metal
1914400	1916320	so that it's not strong.
1916320	1917360	And then it works just fine.
1917360	1919200	And sure enough, as soon as I did all that
1919200	1921760	and tweaked it and put it back together, it worked fine.
1921760	1926000	So I was able to put fourth plus on my DDR machine now.
1926000	1928320	So that's what I'm being playing this week.
1928560	1933200	Um, although I miss having my speed mods already,
1934080	1939120	I'm like, man, I loved fourth plus or fourth mix,
1939120	1943600	but I'm so spoiled I can't do it anymore.
1943600	1945360	It's like, you know, it's trying to play doubles.
1945360	1950240	I was playing a conga feeling and I love that song,
1950240	1953360	but it's just it's going to have to get used to
1953360	1954400	reading that stuff again.
1954400	1956160	I can't wait to come over and play your DDR machine.
1956160	1957680	We just had a day to do that.
1957760	1959280	Yeah, awesome.
1959280	1959840	So anytime.
1960400	1960720	Okay.
1960720	1962160	Anything else for your gaming week?
1962160	1965120	Um, no, that's it.
1965120	1966720	I didn't play any Red Dead Redemption,
1966720	1967600	which is too bad.
1967600	1969680	I'm having trouble like getting back into that
1969680	1972240	because it's just so like engrossing.
1972240	1974800	Um, I, I'm loving some of the clips I'm seeing
1974800	1975760	coming out of that game.
1975760	1978720	Like the, the lady was like, won't you help me?
1978720	1980960	And like, then she gets run over by a horse.
1980960	1984000	Like, just like out of nowhere, this horse comes just like,
1984000	1986080	it's, I guess it might be like a bug,
1986080	1987440	but it's like a really funny bug.
1988240	1990400	AI is never been like, great.
1990400	1992000	I mean, they, they do pretty well,
1992000	1993840	but like sometimes the pathfinding and stuff
1993840	1995040	is not really great.
1995040	1997040	And also deer are kind of crazy,
1997040	1999120	but there's a lot of weird shit in that game.
1999120	2001840	Like there's like UFOs and ghosts and all sorts of like,
2001840	2003280	there's time travelers and stuff.
2003280	2005360	And there's, there's ties between this and
2005360	2009920	Grand Theft Auto five with, um, the, uh, Epsilon cult thing,
2010640	2012800	Epsilon project or, and so weird.
2012800	2016240	I want to play Red Dead, but I'm not until it goes on sale,
2016240	2017680	which will be a good long time.
2017680	2020240	So it won't be that long, but it's a great game.
2020240	2021200	It's definitely worth it.
2021200	2024000	Um, I just, it's, it's very engrossing.
2024000	2025920	And I just, I haven't been able to work,
2025920	2027280	be on the TV is the problem.
2027280	2030320	It's my wife's been still watching all sorts of garbage.
2030320	2032320	What Shondaverse show is she on now?
2032320	2036160	She just finished season two of a Handmaid's Tale.
2036160	2040320	So now she's watching, I don't even fucking know.
2040320	2041200	It's just garbage.
2041200	2042160	It's all garbage.
2042160	2043760	Like I don't even care anymore.
2043760	2045360	It's just, it's some drama.
2045360	2048080	It's, it's anything that's got a drama in it, you know?
2049360	2052960	Look, we have goddamn fucking Netflix on the TV in the bedroom.
2052960	2055680	It's like you can watch TV and sit in bed.
2055680	2057040	I'm almost at the point where I have to move
2057040	2058640	my PlayStation in the bedroom, but like,
2059680	2062880	I have a 4k fucking TV and a PlayStation pro.
2062880	2064640	I don't want to move it onto the tape.
2065600	2067120	And you lose on the switch.
2067120	2068560	You could watch that literally anywhere.
2068560	2070480	Well, we don't necessarily have Hulu.
2070480	2073040	We have a wild world on the internet.
2073040	2073360	I see.
2073360	2074400	Oh, I thought you were watching him.
2075040	2075600	No, no.
2075600	2075760	Yeah.
2075760	2077840	Hulu would be nice too, but we just don't do it.
2079200	2080400	So I haven't been able to play that.
2080400	2083520	And my friends wanted me to get like Fallout 76,
2083520	2084720	but that game is shit.
2084720	2087840	So, you know, but I like shit games sometimes.
2087840	2091440	I just don't want to pay, I don't know, $40 for it.
2091440	2093440	I don't usually get super into the Fallout games.
2093440	2096800	Like I think Ma, the, the, the, um, I almost said the Skyrim games,
2096800	2099120	the Elder Scrolls games are kind of more my thing.
2099120	2100480	I live for from Bethesda.
2100480	2101680	I've tried the Fallout games.
2101680	2103120	I just don't really get into them the same way,
2103120	2105200	but I'm not hearing good things about this new one.
2105200	2107600	Like, I'm just like, everything I'm hearing about this new one is like,
2108240	2111600	like, I guess maybe passing on this is probably the right thing to do.
2111600	2113520	They've already dropped it half price now.
2113520	2114800	That's $39.99.
2114800	2115680	That's crazy to me.
2115680	2117440	It's seriously, this game is like,
2118800	2120720	it's no man's sky all over again.
2120720	2122000	It just seems like it was half baked.
2122000	2122240	Yeah.
2122240	2123520	Oh, it wasn't even half baked.
2123520	2124640	It was like quarter baked.
2124640	2126720	You're like, it is eating the cookie dough.
2126720	2131520	It is like you might, those raw eggs might kill you.
2132160	2136320	Like it, it's just, it's, it's bad.
2137440	2140640	It's bad, but like everybody I talked to, they're having a lot of fun with it,
2140640	2144400	but like as some of the, one of the online reviews I watched,
2144400	2146720	you know, they, they compared it to like Billy Madison,
2146720	2150640	where Billy Madison proves that you can have fun with a flaming bag of shit.
2152640	2154080	It's like why I watch showgirls.
2154080	2154880	Yeah, you can have movies.
2154880	2158880	You can have fun with all sorts of dumb shit with friends.
2158880	2159520	I get it.
2159520	2162160	But it doesn't mean it's a good thing.
2162160	2162880	I hear you.
2162880	2163120	All right.
2163120	2164560	So that's, that's, that's my game.
2164560	2164800	All right.
2164800	2165680	My gaming week.
2165680	2167120	I've also been playing Pokemon.
2167120	2167760	Let's go.
2167760	2170080	Um, um, Loki's talked at length about it.
2170080	2172960	I won't say a whole lot more except for, I like the fact that it's just basically
2172960	2174080	like Pokemon yellow.
2174080	2175840	Cause I have a Pikachu version as well.
2175840	2179760	And I saw a question in chat earlier that asked why, why the Pikachu version,
2179760	2180880	not the Eevee version.
2180880	2182640	My kids, they want a Pikachu.
2182640	2185920	I know I could have gotten Eevee because Pikachu is literally like
2187040	2189120	right there at the beginning of the game.
2189120	2189520	Yeah.
2189520	2191120	But they wanted me to get the Pikachu version.
2191120	2195200	Um, I got the Pikachu version because just kind of informal poll on Twitter
2195200	2198560	of everybody else I know like Eevee seemed to be the more popular one.
2198560	2202400	So I got Pikachu just so I could do the trading so that that's really it.
2202400	2204080	There wasn't a whole lot of thought beyond that.
2204560	2208160	Um, and now thanks to the connection with Pokemon go and the fighting,
2208160	2209920	you just pretty much bring anything in from that.
2209920	2212240	Like you don't even really need, it doesn't really matter which version of
2212240	2213840	the game you have, I guess in that regard.
2213840	2218160	Um, but I do like it, it kind of does feel Loki like a, a Bobby black Wolf
2218160	2221600	mode version of, and if you don't know that inside joke, that's what
2221600	2224960	you call like the easy mode of a game is Bobby black Wolf mode.
2224960	2228320	Uh, is, uh, it kind of feels like the Bobby black Wolf mode of Pokemon
2228320	2231920	yellow because I do, I got to admit, I love that they took the like
2231920	2235440	grinding of the catching of the mobs out of it and they've just replaced
2235440	2238320	it with the much simpler, like flick your wrist and catch it that way.
2238320	2239360	Still pretty grindy.
2239360	2243680	And I don't even do the flicking wrist stuff because I use it in handheld
2243680	2244000	mode.
2244000	2246880	So for me, it's just motion controls.
2246960	2247360	No, I do.
2247360	2248880	I, I, I was able to get the flick.
2248880	2250400	I can even throw them left and right now.
2250400	2253200	I kind of figured out how to, you just, what you do, you, you move your
2253200	2259520	hand to the right and you do a quarter turn of the little, um, no, but
2259520	2261760	that's how you make sure that's how I throw things to the right and the
2261760	2264720	left every time is as I actually throw it to the left, I do a quarter
2264720	2267040	turn of the controller and it always nails it.
2267600	2269840	So that's, that's kind of what's worked for me.
2269840	2275760	Um, but I, I got basically in, I'm only catch one of each Pokemon and
2275760	2279600	then I move on like, and I think I have kind of missed some stuff.
2279600	2282480	I think you have to get that catch combo going in order to get your
2282480	2283120	shinies.
2283120	2284800	Yeah, but I don't need shinies right out the gate.
2284800	2287680	You know what I need to do is beat a fucking Pokemon game.
2287680	2289280	Then I'll go back and get the shinies.
2289280	2292240	If you complete the pokey decks, you'll get a shiny charm.
2292240	2293920	Then they'll make catching the shinies either.
2293920	2296160	So I don't give a fuck about shinies right now.
2296160	2298080	I want to get mildly easier.
2298080	2301280	I'm sick of getting teased because I cannot beat a Pokemon game.
2301280	2302400	So I'm going to beat this one.
2302400	2302800	Damn it.
2302800	2304240	I'm, I'm not as far as you though.
2304240	2308080	I'm only three gyms down, but there's a long trek between gyms two and three.
2308080	2310640	And then now there's another long trek trek between three and four.
2310640	2315280	So I just did the ghost tower, but I wasn't able to get all the way at the
2315280	2316080	top.
2316080	2318560	So then I had to trigger the team rocket sequence.
2318560	2321760	And that's about where I'm at right now without saying too much where I'm at.
2321760	2327120	Um, but honestly, because then it just ends up being battle, battle, battle.
2327120	2329600	Like you just battle all the NPCs over and over and over again.
2329600	2332160	Like that's kind of how I grind NPCs by doing that.
2332240	2335520	And by walking the Pokemon and Poke ball, because you get an insane amount of XP
2335520	2335760	from that.
2335760	2339360	And you can avoid a lot of them too, but like, I don't know.
2339360	2341120	You need it for XP.
2341120	2344960	So yeah, that's how I get my XP because I'm not really catching.
2344960	2347600	So anyway, that's enough said about a Pokemon.
2347600	2348000	Let's go.
2348000	2350800	I think if you're a fan of the Pokemon series, you've probably already.
2350800	2354320	I always, I just pick them up because anything that you pick up, that's extra.
2354320	2358640	Those, the stuff you can trade them in to the professor for candy and for candy.
2358640	2360960	And you can stat boost your Pokemon that way.
2360960	2363120	Yeah, I figure I can always go back and do that again.
2363120	2368400	The walking Loki you get, I know I get, I have, I've gotten so much Charmander
2368400	2368880	candy.
2368880	2373280	I've probably like poured like 40 Charmander candies into my now Charmeleon,
2373280	2375200	who I'm surprised is not a Charizard at this point.
2375200	2377840	Cause the other two are Venusaur.
2377840	2378400	Yeah, I know.
2378400	2379920	I think it's just like one or two levels behind.
2380800	2384800	But anyway, um, so anyhow, talking about some other things I've played this week,
2384800	2388320	of course, I've been continuing on in Final Fantasy 14 because, uh, you know,
2388320	2390800	the, uh, the festival kind of got me jazzed on that again.
2390800	2392160	But I've also been playing World of Warcraft.
2392160	2395680	So my buddy Delvin has been helping me run through some mythics and I'll plug
2395680	2397680	his Twitch channel over at VG realness.
2397680	2400640	Cause sometimes I pop in on his Twitch channel over there.
2400640	2404000	Um, and, uh, we'll do, uh, some mythics.
2404000	2406080	I've done some mythics with him and some other stuff.
2406080	2410000	I've also been oddly getting back into PVP, which I didn't think was something I
2410000	2413760	was into, but it's really fun on an affliction warlock for any of you that are
2413760	2414560	into wow.
2414560	2417280	Um, you will be very happy to know this Loki.
2417280	2420560	One of the thing I did this week is I really spent some time with the VR
2420640	2423360	playing some other games besides just Tetris effect.
2423360	2424000	Don't get me wrong.
2424000	2426880	I played Tetris effect cause I wasn't able to do last week's event cause I was
2426880	2427520	in Vegas.
2427520	2430400	I made sure to do the one this weekend and I finally, yeah, that's right.
2430400	2432480	They have events every Saturday.
2432480	2433600	So oops, you missed it.
2433600	2438240	Uh, but during that time you can play the 1989 skin too, which I think you
2438240	2442160	unlock at some point anyway, but you're able to play it during the weekend.
2442160	2444160	That 1989 skin is awesome.
2444160	2448560	The it's the old school, like Game Boy Tetris, but they, they kind of like the
2448560	2451200	song morphs as it does in other skins.
2451200	2452880	And so it's like the chip tune version at first.
2452880	2456320	And then it's just like totally like, like drum and bass, boom, boom, boom,
2456320	2458560	boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
2458560	2459680	You know, like that whole thing.
2459680	2460240	And it's really cool.
2460240	2462800	And then we get to the end of the stage is like fireworks.
2462800	2464160	It looks really great in VR.
2464160	2464960	I loved it.
2464960	2468080	Um, so I've been playing a little bit of that, but I also went and I finally
2468080	2470480	played some rez in VR, which was great.
2470480	2475680	I played, finally got to play area X in VR, which is gorgeous.
2475680	2477200	And obviously the song is great.
2477200	2480720	It was a little short, but here, I'm going to tell you why area X bugs me
2480720	2480880	though.
2480880	2481360	Like I loved it.
2481360	2485840	Don't get me wrong, but didn't area X totally feel like a proof of concept
2485840	2487280	for like rez too.
2487280	2488000	Yeah.
2488000	2489200	Like what?
2489200	2494400	Cause the weird thing is when you launch area X, it takes forever to load
2494400	2495520	because it's its own game.
2495520	2496400	It's its own thing.
2496400	2496560	Yeah.
2496560	2497520	It's its own like separate thing.
2497520	2501200	It's not, it's not like they built a new area in the first game's engine.
2501200	2503360	They made a new engine out of unreal.
2503360	2506640	If you read the credits, the unreal engine is credited.
2506640	2508720	So they made a brand new engine for rez.
2508720	2510320	They did that just for one area.
2510880	2514560	I'm sorry, but that is a proof of concept of a new rez game that I am being
2514560	2515360	denied right now.
2516240	2519200	It's just like, you know, the home versions of DDR, where do you get the,
2519200	2521840	you know, the preview songs for the next mix in there?
2521840	2523360	They need to greenlight rez too.
2523360	2524480	Cause that was awesome.
2524480	2525760	I loved that playing.
2525760	2526880	That was so cool.
2526880	2529680	There's actually, did you, there's things that, that, in that, that kind of
2529680	2530720	are in Tetris effect too.
2531440	2535840	When you get enough of the powerups, your guy turns into the yoga kind of
2535920	2536800	thing floating through.
2536800	2540240	And that is the same thing you see in Tetris effect.
2540240	2542800	When you're doing the relax modes, the little dude in the background does
2542800	2544800	like the similar poses from rez area.
2544800	2546480	I swear it's like the same thing.
2546480	2551200	So I think, I think there are subtle connections between the enhanced games.
2551200	2554560	I think Tetris effect is made in unreal as well.
2554560	2556240	Oh, I, I'm sure it is.
2556240	2557520	I'm sure a lot of the stuff.
2558080	2560640	I wonder they credit an engine.
2560640	2563680	They call it something like the Synthasia engine.
2563680	2565680	I wonder Synthasia or something like that.
2565760	2569280	I wonder if in the Tetris effects credits, that same engine isn't credited.
2570080	2573280	I would bet Tetris and rez X are built on the same engine.
2573280	2574000	Probably.
2574000	2576800	I wonder if somebody in chat knows that over at live.vognetwork.com.
2576800	2580000	Oh, Bobby Blackwell confirms that Tetris effect is made in unreal.
2580000	2580960	So there is that.
2581600	2584960	So I wonder if it is the same engine.
2584960	2590000	So anyway, uh, I also played Thumper in VR, which that was that music game.
2590000	2590560	That's really hard.
2590560	2592240	They call it like the music horror game.
2592240	2594080	And of course, obviously in VR, that's really cool.
2594080	2597760	I had played that once before I think Shane or somebody had brought their VR
2597760	2601040	over and I think I did play Thumper, but you know, I got to kind of sit down
2601040	2603440	with it a little more and play that game is hard.
2603440	2607120	I don't like calling that a music game because I flop that game so hard.
2607120	2607760	It did.
2607760	2612240	And I didn't get that yet, but I plan to, I just didn't get around to it this week.
2612240	2615680	So, um, and I think, I think that's about it.
2615680	2622080	Oh, I did a quick stream of Metroid, like 8-bit Metroid, because, um, if you set up
2622080	2625600	a Japanese Switch account, which is very easy to do, you just do it online.
2625600	2627760	You set your region in Japan, make a Japanese account.
2627760	2628160	It's free.
2628160	2630080	It doesn't cost anything you can go on.
2630080	2633600	If you use that account on your Switch, you can go onto the Japanese store and
2633600	2638240	you can download the Famicom game collection, which for the most part is
2638240	2640720	not a big deal because it's the same games.
2640720	2644080	It's not like the classic NES and the classic Famicom have like different games.
2644080	2645280	It's not like that on Switch.
2645280	2649600	It's all the same games, except I didn't even realize this Japanese got the SP
2649600	2652960	golf, what, how many of you are really playing that golf game?
2652960	2653440	Okay.
2653440	2657360	So Japanese got the S special golf with everything unlocked, but here's the thing,
2657360	2662800	because it is based off the Famicom stuff, Metroid was a disc game on the Famicom.
2662800	2667200	So when you play Metroid on the Famicom version, you get the thing that looks
2667200	2670720	like the Legend of Zelda, where you have your save files to select from.
2670720	2674400	There's loading times between some of the different zones because it's emulating the
2674400	2678560	disc, but also remember the Famicom had that extra sound chip thing.
2678560	2682080	So there are some subtle noise and sound differences.
2682080	2684800	Like the ice beam makes a very different sound.
2684800	2687360	Those little birds that fly down from the ceiling to try to get you,
2687360	2689280	they make a very, very different noise as well.
2689280	2691600	So I actually did a live stream to just look at some of those,
2691600	2693920	just those little, very, very subtle nuances.
2693920	2696000	But I, those, that's the kind of shit I love.
2696000	2699120	I love looking like at those subtle differences between what we got and what
2699120	2702320	Japan got because back then the hardware was kind of different.
2702320	2702560	Yeah.
2702560	2703280	So, yeah.
2703280	2706720	So I did a little stream of that and I got to do some classic 8-bit Metroid, so.
2706720	2712400	Well, I was watching, I guess they did some, um, an AGDQ type like impromptu thing
2712400	2716560	during some sort of, I don't even know what it was, but like recently.
2716560	2720640	So I watched, they did, someone did a randomizer with the, the Zelda, um,
2720640	2722880	Link to the Past, Super Metroid randomizer.
2723600	2724960	But both games at once?
2724960	2725200	Yeah.
2725200	2732080	So what it does is, is, so the way it works is basically there's four points in, um,
2732080	2734800	Super Metroid that link to, uh, Link to the Past.
2734800	2740320	So you go between the games as, you know, the characters and the items from each are
2740880	2742240	strewn about in the other games.
2742240	2745360	Like all of, so they have some Link to the Past items that are in Link to the Past
2745360	2749200	and some are in Super Metroid.
2749200	2752960	That sounds like what the Nintendo player championships thing, you know,
2752960	2756320	how like the cart would more like you, you get to a certain point rad racer and then
2756320	2760160	you're playing Tetris and then you're collecting coins and Mario brothers and all that stuff.
2760160	2762160	Like, remember how that cartridge would move between the games?
2762160	2764720	That's kind of what it sounds like, but like cooler.
2764720	2766000	Yeah, but yeah, this keeps going.
2766000	2769360	Like, so they had, what they had is they had two speedrunners, um, doing it.
2769360	2774160	One guy who was an expert at like Zelda and the other one was more of an expert at Link
2774160	2775600	to the Past and they kept swapping.
2775600	2776800	You mean Zelda Metroid?
2776800	2777760	Yeah, sorry.
2777760	2777920	Yeah.
2779920	2784320	So they, they were kind of, uh, you know, better suited at each one.
2785280	2788480	And so they were kind of doing that and like, you know, they'd find, oh, hey, here's the,
2789360	2793440	you know, here's some arrows in Metroid and here's,
2793440	2796000	you know, here's the various suit in Link to the Past.
2796000	2798240	And it was neat.
2798240	2798960	I don't know.
2798960	2799840	It'd be fun to play.
2799840	2801440	Yeah, I want to play that.
2801440	2802240	Where's that ROM?
2802240	2802880	I want to check that out.
2802880	2803920	That sounds really cool.
2803920	2804480	Yeah.
2804480	2804720	All right.
2804720	2806080	So that's it for our gaming weeks.
2806080	2810560	So, um, housekeeping, I'll just say follow us on Twitter at twitter.com slash, uh, OLR.
2810560	2814480	We're also on Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio and follow the network over at Twitch TV,
2814480	2816400	VOG Network, all one word.
2816640	2818560	We will not be using the Orange Lounge Radio channel.
2818560	2822560	We're going to be kind of combining our forces all to one place, the VOG Network channel.
2822560	2827200	I don't, I, I'm not going to say never say never to the Orange Lounge Radio Twitch channels.
2827200	2828080	You can follow that too.
2828080	2831200	But, uh, yeah, I'm going to be pointing people to the VOG Network channel.
2831200	2835520	I know Bobby thinks y'all should wait, uh, to see some of the stuff he's got for the,
2835520	2837920	the followers and all that stuff when we go live.
2837920	2842000	But I want to get to that 50 follower account sooner rather than later.
2842000	2844160	So there'll be hopefully more followers in the future too.
2844160	2845280	So, so we'll see.
2845920	2848880	But, uh, anyway, let's get to some other gaming news now.
2848880	2852160	Um, again, this week we are going to cover kind of two weeks worth of news because the
2852160	2855760	week the news was a little lighter this week with it being Thanksgiving and all that.
2855760	2860320	So we are going to cover things from across both weeks as opposed to doing like a cramming
2860320	2862400	last week's news all into a three minute segment.
2862400	2866480	We're going to kind of just cause there's a big holidays, like these first couple of
2866480	2869520	things that came up, there's some big things that happened while we were gone.
2869520	2870000	We were gone.
2870000	2871440	We need to get into, so let's get into it.
2871440	2872240	Loki.
2872240	2877280	So yeah, so yeah, like the last few steam sales, the steam link has been marked down
2877280	2878160	quite a bit now.
2878160	2880240	I think they were selling it for $2 and 50 cents.
2880240	2887440	I've got mine either free or for a dollar, um, with a game at one point on here.
2887440	2892320	But the reason why it's being marked down is because they are selling it out.
2892320	2895680	They have declared that they're not making any more of the hardware.
2895680	2900560	They're phasing it out so you can get your hands on a steam link, uh, cheap.
2900560	2905040	And I think a steam controller as well, uh, while supplies last.
2905040	2909280	Apparently the, it is sold out in Europe and almost sold out in the U S and once they're
2909280	2914560	gone, uh, they plan on continuing support for the existing hardware, but they're not
2914560	2918800	going to be, um, distributing any more of the standalone hardware.
2918800	2924080	Instead, what they're going to be doing is using, um, smartphones, tablets and other
2924080	2930560	Intellivisions to be able to use the steam app to do the steam link stuff, which makes
2930560	2938560	sense because like, for example, my one streaming device I have, it has a steam link app in
2938560	2941600	it so I can use that if I wanted to the stream games.
2941600	2945600	Although I have a laptop, so it's kind of pointless, but I have it anyways, just in
2945600	2947200	case I wanted to.
2947200	2949760	Um, and my phone has that too.
2949760	2953280	So I haven't actually tried that, but it'd be neat.
2953280	2953600	Yeah.
2953600	2957440	I bought a steam link and I bought them when they were still like probably $50.
2957440	2959840	So I feel a little burned, but that's okay.
2959840	2964560	I mean, you know, I got what I paid for and I did, I liked the controller a lot and I
2964560	2967120	did like the device, but I can't really put my finger.
2967120	2969440	And this is the question I'm going to ask kind of to everybody here.
2969440	2970080	Like, I don't know.
2970080	2972560	Well, part one, are you surprised by this news?
2972560	2973060	No.
2973520	2973840	Okay.
2973840	2974560	Part two.
2974560	2975120	Why then?
2975120	2976480	What, why did steam link?
2977520	2979200	Why didn't it, I guess, succeed?
2979760	2986400	I'm not surprised because they dropped support for like steam boxes so quickly and it makes
2986400	2987920	sense that they would have dropped support for this.
2988480	2992480	You know, it's just hardware doesn't, this doesn't seem to be a thing that people
2992480	2994320	necessarily need.
2994320	3000960	Like, you know, if you're going to be playing games on like a PC and stuff, most people
3000960	3005120	are just hooking their PCs up to their TV or they're hooking their, they were just
3005120	3006480	playing on their PC.
3006480	3013680	There's not really a big demand for playing a PC game, you know, on your TV and streaming
3013680	3017360	it over, you know, the wifi to play the same thing.
3018080	3018960	I guess it makes sense.
3018960	3023520	Like if you have like in an office or something like that, but it's just, I think people
3023520	3024400	are just so comfortable.
3024400	3027920	Like when you think about like someone's computer set up, like they have a nice keyboard,
3027920	3031680	they have a nice mouse, they have a nice gaming chair, possibly that they're sitting
3031680	3032640	in nice monitors.
3033280	3035760	Why would I leave that to go somewhere else?
3035760	3038400	Unless you do like trying to do like a party game or something like that.
3038400	3039040	Yeah.
3039040	3039600	Stream it over.
3039600	3041760	It's just the use case is very limited.
3041760	3042080	I think.
3042080	3045360	I think that's kind of what it ended up being as much of like a neat piece of technology
3045360	3046160	as it was.
3046160	3049680	I think also it was kind of lacking in not, not everybody's going to agree with this,
3049680	3055440	but I think they were really lacked in not having a Netflix app, a Hulu app, so it could
3055440	3059200	compete on the level with like Roku boxes and stuff.
3059200	3062720	So that way, if you were looking at Steam Link, it's like, oh, well, this one not only
3062720	3065920	will do Netflix, Hulu, but this one will play all my PC games too.
3065920	3066800	So this is the better value.
3066800	3067360	Exactly.
3067360	3072320	That would have been ideal, but it's like, it just like the whole Steam Box idea, it's
3072320	3076080	kind of a half-baked idea and they just didn't really implement it too well.
3076080	3079120	They kind of, they kind of stopped two thirds of the way, if you will.
3080720	3084880	Looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com, VidPower says best thing about Steam Link is you can
3084880	3087120	minimize it and use your PC on your TV.
3087120	3090480	And Bobby Black Wolf says, yeah, I use Steam Link to watch streaming services that don't
3090480	3091840	have a console app.
3091840	3096160	Bobby Black Wolf also says, I think now they just want to get a Steam Link app on your
3096160	3096640	Roku.
3096640	3097920	And I think, I think he's right.
3097920	3101040	I think that's where it's headed now because aren't there already televisions that have
3101040	3102240	the Steam thing built in?
3102240	3105520	Well, the Android TV has the Steam Link app.
3105520	3108080	So I have that for my Android TV that I've got.
3108960	3112240	I don't believe my Roku has a Steam Link app.
3112240	3112480	Yeah.
3112480	3115440	And just to be clear, like Bobby Black Wolf was saying, this is an example.
3115440	3118080	The Steam wants to be, that is not, and just, yeah.
3118080	3119920	Cause somebody in chat asked, oh, there's a Steam.
3119920	3120960	No, not yet.
3120960	3122720	But this is just kind of the progression.
3122720	3122960	Yeah.
3122960	3125360	Cause I think I would have looked at that.
3125360	3128480	I would have put it on there if they had that, but no, they didn't have that.
3128480	3133920	But hey, my TV that doesn't have, you know, Android TV that has a Steam Link app, I guess
3133920	3137920	I could just hook my Steam Link up to that if I really wanted to.
3137920	3141840	I don't though, cause I don't even know where it, no, I do know where it is.
3141840	3144320	It's in the same place that my PlayStation TV is.
3144320	3146480	You know what also ruined Steam Link for me?
3147040	3153680	The game, the first game I tried to play on my TV was that Tron runner, Tron run R.
3153680	3154480	That was the name of it.
3154480	3155520	So you remember that game?
3155520	3155760	Yeah.
3155760	3156000	Okay.
3156000	3160960	So the thing about that game level like four would freeze on my computer and I couldn't
3160960	3164080	get past it because of some weird thing with my video card.
3164080	3168080	So even when I was using the Steam Link, I could never get that part in the game.
3168080	3171680	So it's like in my mind, you just kind of associate that mental thing.
3172240	3179280	It's like, you know, if you, let's say eat at Taco Bell and it makes you really sick,
3179280	3182320	you're probably not going to eat Taco Bell again for a long time.
3182320	3187200	That's like the kind of response, the Pavlov's response that I got with my Steam Link is
3187200	3189280	that Steam Link's just crashing my computer.
3189280	3191920	Unless, you know, you do whether it's rational or not.
3191920	3192800	That's what happened.
3192800	3197360	I do where we haven't gone out to eat in a certain place in a long time.
3197360	3201120	And so then we go back out there and we're like, oh yeah, that's why we don't come here
3201200	3201680	anymore.
3202560	3206640	And then you do that again a few years later because you forget why you stopped coming
3206640	3207600	someplace.
3207600	3209840	It's, yeah, I don't know.
3211440	3211920	All right.
3211920	3212800	So yeah.
3212800	3214960	R.I.P. Steam Link, I guess.
3214960	3215520	That's that.
3216480	3217200	All right.
3217200	3222320	Let's move on and talk about, this is, I think, kind of a big deal that came out the
3222320	3223280	week we were off.
3223280	3225840	And I was like, well, bummer we didn't have a show this weekend.
3225840	3227120	So we'll talk about it now.
3227120	3230720	I'm sure as many of you have heard by now, the announcement came out that Sony Interactive
3230720	3235440	Entertainment will not be participating with E3 in the year 2019.
3235440	3238000	So next year they will be skipping E3.
3238640	3243120	In a statement that the company gave to Game Informer, they said, as the industry evolves,
3243120	3246240	Sony Interactive Entertainment continues to look for inventive opportunities to engage
3246240	3247040	the community.
3247040	3250720	PlayStation fans mean the world to us, and we always want to innovate, think differently,
3250720	3252960	and experiment with new ways to delight gamers.
3252960	3256640	As a result, we have decided not to participate in E3 2019.
3256640	3261680	We are exploring new and familiar ways to engage our community in 2019 and can't wait
3261680	3263520	to share our plans with you.
3263520	3267200	And so some people wondering, well, what does this mean for like, are they going to do what
3267200	3268080	EA does?
3268080	3272400	And EA doesn't participate in E3, but they're like across the street at the same time doing
3272400	3273520	their own shit, right?
3273520	3278000	Well, Sony clarified, Senior Vice President of Communications, Jennifer Clark said, we
3278000	3283200	will not activate or hold a press conference around E3.
3283200	3288320	So Sony, not going to be in LA in June.
3288320	3291440	That was the perfect time to announce your next gen system, Microsoft.
3292320	3294160	Which could very well happen.
3295040	3300480	Just so you know, in a related story, I'm sure people were contacting right away, Nintendo
3300480	3302960	and Microsoft were contacted right away about E3.
3303600	3306160	Both have confirmed they will be at E3.
3306160	3312480	Phil Spencer actually wrote a tweet, a lot to share with fans at E3 2019, always a high
3312480	3316320	point of the year to witness the industry's creativity and the energy of the community.
3316320	3321920	The official Xbox account saying, we can't wait to see you at E3 2019.
3321920	3326320	Reggie Fils-Aime saying E3 is an outstanding opportunity for us to share new games and
3326320	3328480	experiences with the fans and business partners from around the globe.
3328480	3330160	And that's a statement that E3 actually put out.
3330160	3331680	So those two companies will still be there.
3331680	3337440	I think the thought, it seems like the general consensus is that Sony is just kind of resting
3337440	3341120	high on their laurels and they're just like, yeah, we don't fucking need you guys.
3341200	3345280	And so they're, I don't know if they have anything to show because I think it's more
3345280	3349760	column B. I don't think it's necessarily Sony being crass, which is, you know, gamers
3349760	3353840	oftentimes when a knee jerk reactor take it to a negative space because I think that's
3353840	3358320	the reality is that Sony doesn't have anything they really, or, or the stuff they're going
3358320	3362320	to show is the stuff they've already shown and they're going to get read for it because
3362320	3364320	Last of Us 2 still isn't out.
3364320	3365760	And I don't, have they dated that yet?
3366320	3368240	This is probably next holiday.
3368240	3371120	So yeah, Last of Us 2, they're still Death Stranding.
3371680	3373120	Death Stranding is probably the next holiday.
3373120	3374800	Zombie game that they're supposed to be coming.
3374800	3376080	Days Gone or is that what it is?
3376080	3376400	Days Gone.
3376400	3378720	I think they did Days Gone finally because it got pushed back.
3379360	3381520	The Samurai game that they had coming.
3381520	3385760	So I kind of think if they were to have E3, they'd probably be rehashing a bit.
3385760	3388320	I mean, maybe that Final Fantasy 7 remake someday.
3388320	3389120	I don't know.
3389120	3393840	So, uh, I think I can sort of see that maybe Sony's just like, you know, we don't have
3393840	3397520	a lot to show this year because we're setting up for the next year.
3397520	3400160	But there is that, I'm going to be honest.
3400160	3402000	There's that cynical side of me as well too.
3402000	3406000	That's like, I don't think it's so much Sony being on a high horse, but I seem to
3406000	3411360	remember after we all remember the infamous E3 when the PlayStation 3 was unveiled.
3411360	3414640	Giant enemy crabs, $599 US dollars, right?
3414640	3417440	All those sound bites that came back to haunt Sony.
3417440	3420720	I seem to remember Sony threatened to pull out that year too.
3422320	3424160	They didn't, but they almost did.
3424800	3431040	And I seem to recall this last year wasn't like superbly well received at the press
3431040	3432320	conference at Sony.
3432320	3436560	I mean, no, cause it wasn't, it wasn't like the games weren't like a problem or anything.
3436560	3439600	I think people were generally excited about like Spider-Man stuff, but I think people
3439600	3444560	were just like, Oh, why are we standing in this barn and then going to this thing?
3444560	3447120	And it got like a lot of like crap online.
3447120	3454480	And so I think honestly, somebody, honestly, Loki, you, me, Jamie, Bobby Black Wolf, we
3454480	3459200	all sat down four years ago or so and kind of asked ourselves, is it really worth it
3459200	3460720	for us to go to E3 anymore?
3460720	3462880	Are we getting value out of E3 anymore?
3462880	3467440	And honestly, somebody at Sony in a boardroom probably asked that same question.
3467440	3471280	Like we paid all this money for this to get this online.
3471280	3472480	Why are we doing E3?
3473040	3475280	I think somebody asked that very hard question.
3475280	3481760	But then again, like you're the one that made the choice to hold your little video
3481760	3484560	thing in a barn with like a musical guest and stuff.
3484560	3485360	And yes, I get it.
3485360	3488000	The guy is like, he's good.
3488000	3492880	He's a good musical guest, but is it really necessary to do that?
3492880	3494640	Couldn't you just show a trailer and be done with it?
3494640	3497200	I mean, like who, I don't know.
3497200	3497920	I just think it.
3499280	3500800	Let me get to some of the comments in our chat.
3501680	3502880	Live.vognetwork.com.
3502880	3507520	SSG100Matt says, I think Sony's recent moves decision not to do a PlayStation experience
3507520	3507760	show.
3507760	3508960	Remember, that's a thing too.
3508960	3512640	And skipping E3 seemed to indicate that they're going to go all out in 2020.
3512640	3516480	Sony cited that they don't have enough console exclusive and things in development not announced
3516480	3518640	to warrant doing either show entirely.
3518640	3523120	This leads me to believe they are going to rely on major game ports, the handful of games
3523120	3526640	they are releasing in 2019, and even the PlayStation 1 classic.
3526640	3528080	And let's not forget third party.
3528640	3530720	Third party is hugely important in that too.
3530720	3532080	That PlayStation 1 classic.
3532080	3534640	I have very low expectations for that.
3534640	3535140	Yeah.
3536320	3536960	Let's see.
3536960	3538720	Also, comments in chat.
3539600	3543840	Yyr in chat says, remember the last one to two years of the 360.
3543840	3545520	Microsoft had nothing.
3545520	3548320	PlayStation 3 delivered and caught up.
3548320	3550480	I wonder if the opposite might happen now.
3551120	3552320	Slightly different dynamic.
3552320	3555760	Yyr to PlayStation 3, and I'm using my quotey fingers, catching up.
3555760	3560000	PlayStation always kind of had the advantage in Japan too, which Microsoft, even with the
3560000	3562080	360, was never really able to do.
3562080	3567200	And I don't really see them breaking through that Japan wall with Xbox One either.
3567760	3573120	Potentially their next system, again, I think the biggest bombshell in the world would be
3573120	3578240	Microsoft announcing they've acquired a Japanese studio amongst all these studio acquisitions
3578240	3578880	they're doing.
3578880	3579920	But we're all waiting on that.
3579920	3582000	Maybe that'll be the bombshell they drop next E3.
3582000	3582480	I don't know.
3582480	3583760	I'm fan wanking.
3583760	3584720	I'm making shit up.
3585360	3589760	But I mean, that would really turn heads that if Microsoft is going to put some more focus
3589760	3590720	back on Japan.
3590720	3593520	But certainly Microsoft could certainly use this opportunity.
3593520	3594480	Absolutely.
3594480	3602880	But, you know, Sony is probably loading the guns with exclusives for the inevitable PlayStation
3602880	3603440	5.
3603440	3608880	That seems more and more likely for 2020 as whatever Microsoft is probably doing next
3608880	3614160	is probably 2020 unless, I don't know, they did kind of tease it a little bit at this
3614160	3614480	last year.
3614480	3615920	Maybe they are going to do it in 2019.
3615920	3618480	Maybe they're going to try to get a year jump on it like they did with the 360.
3619280	3624080	They may not announce it at E3 because Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were not unveiled at
3624080	3624480	E3.
3624480	3625760	They were done at separate events.
3625760	3627600	So who knows?
3627600	3628560	So many things could happen.
3628560	3634720	But what we do know, Microsoft is starting, they're moving the chess pieces, right?
3634720	3636880	They have acquired all of these studios.
3636880	3637600	Why?
3637600	3638880	Exclusives.
3638880	3639680	What?
3639680	3641200	Next Xbox.
3641200	3645040	So I fully expect that next Xbox gets announced.
3645040	3650080	And I think probably in 2020 to give these games time to cook and so forth so that they
3650080	3654240	can say we've got this exclusive, this exclusive, this exclusive, this exclusive.
3654240	3658400	And don't worry, Crackdown is coming out in 2020 next year.
3659760	3660560	Right around the corner.
3662000	3667680	But Sony, I think, is in a position where they're positioning themselves for a similar
3667680	3668160	thing.
3668160	3672640	They're basically taking an entire year off and relying on third parties, relying on indies
3672640	3681200	and that stuff so that they can also navigate and get lined up for 2020 and have this, this,
3681200	3684480	and this ready to go in response to what Microsoft's going to do.
3684480	3686640	2020 is going to be an exciting year.
3686640	3691360	You know, honestly, in my opinion, Microsoft's not the one that stands to gain from this
3691360	3691600	scenario.
3691600	3693360	You know who's really going to gain from this scenario?
3694720	3697520	Everybody's favorite number two, Nintendo.
3698320	3698800	Nintendo.
3699760	3702800	Nintendo is going to be clean, clean slate next year.
3702800	3706400	They could, they're going to put out the new Animal Crossing game.
3706400	3709280	Probably Metroid Prime 4 happens next year.
3709280	3713280	If they wanted to redo the Switch and do a Super Switch or a Switch XL, whatever the
3713280	3715440	fuck they want to do, next year's the year to do it.
3715440	3717680	Like Nintendo has a clear path next year.
3717680	3723360	It'll be very interesting to see what they do with it since they don't compete with Microsoft
3723360	3724480	and Sony after all.
3724480	3726320	So next year's all them.
3726320	3729680	Well, I shouldn't say that because, you know, we will have Death Stranding.
3729680	3731920	Last of Us 2, I'm sure is going to be amazing.
3731920	3733840	Microsoft, it's not like they're taking the year off.
3733840	3734640	They have their own stuff.
3734640	3736800	Yeah, they don't compete unless they're winning.
3736800	3739120	Yeah, that's like, that's like my kids.
3739120	3743440	Like, well, I wasn't racing anyway, so it doesn't matter that I came in second.
3744560	3749280	Yeah, yeah, I'm sure they're like, oh yeah, we're not competing with those guys when they're
3749280	3750000	down in the numbers.
3750000	3754000	But then like, oh yeah, our console is the most number, you know, it sold the most units
3754000	3754800	out of all of them.
3755520	3756000	We're great.
3756240	3757200	But we're not competing.
3758720	3763440	YYR in chat says, yeah, Xbox One isn't catching all the way up, but they can build momentum
3763440	3764560	for the next generation.
3764560	3767600	I think that's a very interesting way to look at it, momentum.
3767600	3771760	And I'll be very curious to see what Sony does to kind of bridge the gap.
3771760	3775680	Are they going to go the Nintendo route and do more directs?
3776400	3779120	Like, obviously, Sony doesn't do a direct, but you know what I mean?
3779120	3785680	Like, you know, when they did their E3 thing this last time, they had the press
3785760	3788880	conferences happening in the barn and that stadium thing.
3788880	3791920	What did they fill in the interim with during E3?
3791920	3796240	Their team that does all that, their blog cast people that do all the online content.
3796240	3800480	So what's to say these guys don't put together little special TV shows and, you know, online
3800480	3804080	TV shows and things that are akin to Nintendo's directs?
3804080	3807840	And that's how Sony puts news out in the next year.
3809120	3809620	Who knows?
3810960	3811600	So we'll see.
3811600	3813600	Next year is going to be very interesting for momentum.
3814560	3818640	Let me ask one more question for everybody.
3818640	3824080	Let's take the focus off Sony a little bit and let's put the focus on E3 itself.
3824960	3826000	Is E3 dead?
3826640	3828560	Does this just prove that E3 is dead?
3829600	3830160	Yes or no?
3830160	3834640	Support your E3 hasn't really necessarily been E3 for a few years now.
3835760	3837280	So elaborate, please.
3837280	3841520	It just kind of morphing into its own thing because, you know, this is like its final
3842480	3846720	or one of the pieces to transition back into E4 all type of things.
3846720	3847920	Oh, that's damn you.
3847920	3849040	Because that's exactly where I was going.
3849040	3853520	It's like now we're going to get the show that E4 all was supposed to be.
3854320	3858960	E3 has been slowly morphing into the show that E4 all was supposed to be.
3858960	3862640	But now no one's going to care because E4 all is just basically PAX, but PAX is better.
3862640	3868720	So, you know, well, but is PAX better than what E3 is going to put out?
3869120	3872080	Let's analyze that for a moment.
3872080	3875920	If E3 now views its competition as PAX, which I'm not necessarily saying is true,
3875920	3878480	I realize E3 is still a trade show.
3878480	3879440	PAX is still a fan.
3879440	3880480	She's got a Gamescom.
3880480	3884960	But one of your biggest fucking trade companies just backed out of the show.
3884960	3890800	So would E3 be smarter to reposition itself and embrace this fan thing
3890800	3893440	more than they've already been doing in the past couple of years?
3894400	3898560	You know, maybe E3 the trade show is is dying.
3898560	3902400	We'll say that I won't say the finality of is dead, but is dying.
3903040	3905760	E3 the fan show is growing.
3905760	3908720	You know, obviously they're not going to bring that name E4 all back
3908720	3911440	because everybody's going to associate that with a conference that didn't work.
3911440	3916080	But I mean, a lot of those same kind of things that E4 all was going for.
3916080	3919520	Isn't that kind of what E3 is like slowly turning into away from a trade show
3919520	3921200	and competing with something like PAX?
3921440	3925360	And I'm sorry, but PAX hasn't been good since 2010, in my opinion.
3925360	3928960	So is it better than PAX?
3929760	3930240	Maybe.
3930240	3932960	I don't know, but I just I don't know.
3932960	3938400	It's I don't have any like like I never feel like even nowadays, like,
3939280	3943120	oh, man, I really wish I'd gone to E3 this year.
3943120	3944560	I don't feel that at all anymore.
3945360	3949360	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I like how video games are one of the only industries
3949440	3953360	where the consumers won't allow an industry trade show to exist
3953360	3955440	without them being a part of it.
3955440	3956720	Do movies do this, too?
3956720	3957440	Does movies?
3957440	3958400	No, I guess.
3958400	3962640	I mean, I feel like in a way, because all of it shows up on the Internet, but maybe not.
3962640	3965760	Well, movies, I don't even know if they have really any trade shows, perhaps.
3966640	3968480	Cinema West or whatever that thing's called.
3968480	3971520	I don't where they show all the new trailers.
3971520	3973120	It was in Vegas this past year.
3973120	3974160	I feel like there's a couple.
3974160	3975440	But yeah, I get I don't know.
3975440	3979120	But like, I know there's like a lot of stuff takes place during like comic cons nowadays.
3979120	3979680	It seems like.
3981600	3984880	Vidpower in chat says, E3's brand name is still important,
3984880	3989760	as non-gamers only know of E3 and probably don't know of other gaming conventions like PAX.
3991120	3991680	Interesting.
3991680	3993840	The name recognition.
3993840	3997040	E3 is the type of thing that tends to get covered in newspapers
3997920	4002400	on news channels for general people, not just necessarily a gamer audience.
4003360	4007120	Dartitsuya in chat says, does D23 count?
4007120	4009280	Though that's Disney exclusively, I think.
4009280	4011840	Well, but think of all the things Disney's been snapping up lately.
4011840	4013280	Disney's Marvel now.
4013280	4015280	So that is included in D23.
4015280	4016720	Disney Star Wars.
4016720	4019760	The latest Star Wars trailers show up at D23.
4020320	4021440	Disney is ABC.
4022320	4029520	So yes, D23 is Disney, but Disney is much more than just cartoons and Disneyland at this point.
4029520	4031200	Disney is a big empire.
4031840	4036800	So Bobby Blackwell says, I think the thing that caused E3 to decline
4036800	4038880	was making it not just a trade show.
4040560	4045760	I think in a way, yes, but I think with virtual conferencing and virtual technology being
4045760	4049600	bigger and bigger and the fact that we do get more of our stuff across the internet and that,
4049600	4052080	you know, YouTube's deliver all the same information.
4052080	4055760	We're doing conferences across video and working from home and all this stuff that
4055760	4058480	we didn't do 10 years ago nearly as much.
4058480	4060400	I kind of think that all plays into it.
4060400	4063360	I think a lot of trade happens virtually.
4063360	4067280	Like you just don't have to take a trip out to LA anymore to see stuff.
4067280	4067920	That's the thing.
4070000	4070800	Anyway.
4070800	4073840	All right, let's move on or we can probably spend a whole three hours on this topic,
4073840	4075120	but we do have other things we want to cover.
4075120	4075920	So let's move on.
4075920	4076420	Loki.
4076880	4082400	So No Man's Sky rolled out with another patch over the last week here.
4082400	4088640	So they have this new free patch called Visions and it added some new stuff to the game,
4088720	4091200	including new biomes.
4091200	4098320	It had some creatures in outer space, more palette variety in the planets.
4098320	4100800	They had new fauna in the game.
4102240	4104640	Lots of new tweaks that make kind of the game look better.
4106000	4107040	New base parts.
4108000	4113680	And I really need to go back to this game, but it's free and it's continuing to update,
4113680	4115680	making the game even better than it was before,
4116560	4119440	which we could say the same about Fallout 76,
4119440	4123280	but maybe that will follow in the same path and, you know.
4123280	4124240	You know what, despite-
4124240	4125840	50 gigabyte update at a time.
4125840	4129920	Despite all the shit that Hello Games has got over the years for No Man's Sky,
4129920	4133040	like you got to hand it to them that they are still pouring in the effort
4133040	4135760	to continue to improve and evolve this game.
4135760	4136240	It's pretty bad.
4136240	4139040	I feel less bad about them doing it because,
4139040	4142480	or like the situation with them because they had a smaller team
4142800	4144400	buying it, whereas Bethesda was like,
4145040	4148720	you know, hey, we got our Fallout team and we got some mid team
4148720	4150640	and we got these other guys doing it.
4150640	4151920	We have these other guys doing it.
4151920	4154560	We have all these people from Bethesda like putting it together.
4154560	4156480	It's like, this is what you came up with.
4156480	4157600	And I think I think you're right.
4157600	4160960	A lot of people have said that some of these issues with No Man's Sky
4160960	4163680	and what the internet made it out to be was that you had a,
4163680	4168720	you know, indie developer being treated like a very ambitious idea,
4168720	4174080	whereas multiplayer Fallout 4 recycled, not so ambitious.
4174080	4174580	Yeah.
4175760	4176960	But hey, check it out.
4176960	4179280	It's free if you have the game.
4179280	4181120	So why not?
4181120	4181620	Why not?
4182240	4185520	And I bet a lot of people probably pick that up on sale at some point or something.
4185520	4186160	So, oh, yeah.
4186160	4186660	Yes.
4187200	4190560	They sell the fall sale and hey, tomorrow is Cyber Monday.
4190560	4193120	Did you get suckered into buying anything from any of these Black Friday,
4193120	4195440	Cyber Monday sales, Steam sales going on?
4195440	4196640	Nintendo had a big sale.
4196640	4200320	I was tempted to buy games on the Switch for my kids,
4200320	4203360	but I can't really all of them were digital.
4203360	4206640	So I don't really want to do that because I need to give it to them for Christmas.
4207200	4210480	And I just haven't been able to order that stuff.
4210480	4211760	I'm waiting till tomorrow.
4211760	4214400	Let's see what I can pick up for them because they want to get like,
4215040	4216480	you know, all the popular game.
4216480	4216880	Oh, my God.
4216880	4221120	So like speaking of sort of video games, I went and saw Wreck-It Ralph 2 this weekend.
4221120	4221840	Oh, how was that?
4221840	4222320	I want to go see it.
4222320	4223200	It was fantastic.
4223200	4224240	Oh, I can't wait.
4224240	4224880	So it's great.
4224880	4228640	They have a game in the you saw them trailer called Slaughter Race,
4228640	4231760	which is basically Grand Theft Auto, which is fantastic.
4233200	4238400	But there's like they're talking about like, you know, this YouTube type of thing,
4238400	4241680	you know, that they're trying to get him lots of views and likes and stuff
4241680	4245760	so that he gets money to order this part or whatever.
4245760	4250160	And so they're talking about like the different things that are popular and stuff.
4250160	4253360	And of course, there is like literally a two second clip of Fortnite
4253360	4256480	and all the fucking kids in the entire theater, including my own son.
4256480	4258240	It's like, oh, my God, Fortnite.
4258240	4261920	You know, it's just it's like, oh, my God, did you say Fortnite?
4261920	4262560	Oh, my God.
4264480	4265440	And so it's the game of the week.
4265440	4270480	But like so, yeah, he wants like stuff, you know, like they want to get Hello Neighbor,
4270480	4274160	which is, you know, the popular like kind of, you know, not babies first,
4274160	4276800	but kids first horror game.
4280720	4281840	Babies first horror game.
4282640	4284080	I thought it was like Five Nights at Freddy's
4284080	4285440	because those games aren't really violent.
4285440	4285920	That too.
4285920	4288320	And like he's wanted me to give him Five Nights at Freddy's.
4288320	4290240	And I'm like, you know, Custom Night's free.
4290240	4294080	You just play that for free in Bendy and the Ink Machine.
4294080	4299040	You know, it's also another horror game very much in the horror games.
4299920	4300960	And of course, Roblox.
4300960	4303840	He wants me to give him some like in-game currency for that game.
4303840	4304480	Oh, boy.
4304480	4305680	They have so much garbage on there.
4305680	4308720	But oh, my God, it's all all the time.
4308720	4312960	But yeah, my no, my youngest son, my like four year old wants Hello Neighbor.
4314480	4315520	I don't even know that game.
4315520	4315920	That's funny.
4315920	4316640	Hello Neighbor.
4316640	4319280	It's about I don't even know necessarily the premise of the game.
4319280	4322640	I know that you basically break into this guy's house next door.
4322640	4323600	And I think you should teach.
4323600	4325760	And it's like this giant weird house.
4325760	4328480	You just find out what's like going on over there.
4328480	4331120	Like I don't know if he's murdering kids or something, but like something.
4331120	4331440	What?
4331440	4332480	Don't buy that for children.
4332480	4333520	It's an E10 game.
4333520	4334000	It's fine.
4334000	4335920	It's he's probably not actually murdering kids.
4335920	4338080	Or if it's, you know, it's not super violent.
4338080	4339200	It's just ketchup.
4339200	4340000	It's E10.
4340000	4345120	But like apparently you're trying to like sneeze and he sets traps and stuff like that.
4345120	4347520	And so I don't know what the premise is.
4347520	4350880	It's just teaching you about burglarizing people's houses, I guess.
4350880	4351520	Interesting.
4353040	4353280	Yeah.
4353280	4354880	So that and then they have like the Leo games.
4354880	4356560	Sia Tabiri says kidnapping.
4356560	4358720	Hello Neighbor is giant puzzle stealth.
4358720	4361280	Bobby Black Wolf suggests Night Trap for babies.
4361280	4362240	Night Trap for babies.
4364960	4365600	Night twap.
4368080	4373200	All right.
4374160	4375040	I hate it.
4375040	4375360	All right.
4375360	4375920	Let's move on.
4377040	4381120	So we were talking about big developers, big teams, developing things.
4382000	4385680	Still chatter about Diablo and the mess that happened.
4385680	4386160	Oh yeah.
4386160	4387840	Oh, still angry.
4387840	4389440	Still stuff about this.
4389440	4394160	Not so much about Diablo Immortal at this point, but talk about people coming out of the woodwork.
4394160	4396320	You know, anonymous tipsters and things like that.
4396400	4401520	Talking about Diablo 4 that's been in development and what it is.
4401520	4405600	And apparently part of the reason why they weren't ready to announce it yet is that the game has gone
4405600	4406800	through some changes.
4406800	4412080	Apparently the first version of Diablo, according to reports online, Kotaku did this whole,
4412080	4413200	you know, expose on it.
4413200	4415680	And I think other websites are kind of piggybacked on it.
4415680	4417680	Apparently there was a Diablo project under work.
4417680	4418800	It was called Hades.
4419360	4425440	It was basically Blizzard's version of Dark Souls, but it was in the Diablo universe.
4426320	4431280	It was a mainline Diablo project that was headed up by Josh Mosquera, who did Diablo 3
4431280	4433920	Reaper of Souls, who has since left Blizzard.
4433920	4435840	Although obviously they never talk about why.
4435840	4437600	Did he do it to go do a new company?
4437600	4438560	Did he do it because of this?
4438560	4439280	I don't know.
4439280	4443680	But anyway, it would have been, they say, a Gothic challenging dungeon crawler.
4443680	4446000	It was Diablo's take on Dark Souls.
4446000	4450080	Apparently this was going to be an over the shoulder third person perspective.
4450880	4453360	They may not have ended up calling it Diablo 4.
4453360	4454320	It was so different.
4454320	4456880	But that's kind of where it started as.
4456880	4462320	As a Diablo fan, I think this sounds terrible, but I bet my husband would be super into it
4462320	4465840	because he loves Dark Souls and he also has played a lot of Diablo 3.
4465840	4469840	So this is probably up his alley, but I'm all about loot, loot, loot, loot, loot.
4469840	4473680	I don't care about like super hard mode, but that's what I, maybe it wasn't that.
4473680	4477520	I mean, we hear Dark Souls and that's a certain type of, oh, you died, you died, you died.
4477520	4478080	Right.
4478080	4480880	And maybe Blizzard was not going to really do it that same way.
4480880	4483600	What is it with Activision and trying to copy everybody?
4483600	4486480	I mean, like I understand this is Blizzard, but it's still Activision.
4486480	4491360	And it's like you have a game formula that Blizzard is fucking good at it.
4491360	4494000	Look at what they did with Overwatch, Team Fortress 2.
4494000	4494480	Look what they do.
4494480	4495920	The Heroes of the Storm, League of Legends.
4495920	4496960	Look what they did with that.
4496960	4497920	They do it.
4497920	4499840	They don't bring it to you every time, Loki.
4499840	4501680	Yeah, but look what they did with Diablo.
4502640	4504240	Diablo 3 is great now.
4506800	4510320	Okay, but that's, that's a whole nother reason.
4510320	4516080	That, that is a game made for China that should have never been on the main stage at Blizzcon.
4516080	4517200	We talked about this a couple of weeks ago.
4517200	4518160	It was the messaging.
4518160	4522720	If the messaging had been different on that game, nobody would give a shit.
4522720	4527280	The problem was it was the big announcement at a convention people paid $150 to go to.
4527280	4530640	They should have kept it a sideshow and they should have let the Warcraft 3 remaster have
4530640	4531280	the spotlight.
4532240	4533360	It would have been fine.
4534080	4536080	But anyway, we already talked about that.
4536080	4537600	So, uh, let's see.
4538560	4540080	Uh, this, uh, was canceled.
4540080	4544720	Apparently there was also a planned second expansion for Diablo 3 that was canceled.
4544720	4547920	And that pisses me off because that game deserved a second expansion.
4547920	4552720	Uh, I would love to see what they, I feel like now, now the necromancer thing feels
4552720	4556080	even more half-assed knowing that there was supposed to be a second expansion at some
4556080	4556480	point.
4556480	4557040	Well, that's okay.
4557040	4560160	The second expansion will just be a part of like pre-ordered DLC.
4560160	4561520	Well, there is no second expansion now.
4561520	4564320	I mean, it'll be just rolled into whatever next game it is.
4564320	4565040	Yeah.
4565280	4569120	So anyway, apparently there is still a Diablo project that's in the works.
4569120	4573040	It's being headed up by what's left of the Diablo 3 team, team three.
4573040	4575920	Uh, and it's going to be another mainline entry in the series.
4575920	4580800	Uh, but it's still very early on and even the camera perspective may still change to
4580800	4583680	what they had on this, uh, project Hades.
4583680	4586880	So, uh, Diablo 4 still a long ways out.
4586880	4593840	And that is ultimately probably why Blizzard chose not to even show us a logo at this time
4593840	4596400	and make the decisions they did.
4596400	4599360	I would love to know why the second expansion got canceled.
4600000	4601760	That's the, that's the answer I want.
4601760	4604480	Why did Diablo 3 second expansion get canceled?
4604480	4605920	And that's, that's not really me.
4605920	4610400	Cause it sounds like people inside Blizzard were very surprised to hear it was canceled
4610400	4611280	as well.
4611280	4613280	So, interesting.
4615280	4619680	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade at vognetwork.com,
4619680	4621440	use the passphrase TWIG.
4621440	4623760	Anyhow, let's move on.
4623760	4626960	We have just a couple more stories before we get to the classic game of the week.
4626960	4627760	Loki.
4627760	4632560	So there's been rumors that there's going to be a new version of the Switch coming out
4632560	4633760	at some point soon.
4634400	4640480	And now that's kind of backed up a little bit by this consumer service video that Nintendo
4640480	4645040	has put out called how to prepare a Nintendo Switch for trade in or sale.
4646320	4651040	So basically telling you how you are supposed to like, you know, back up your data to the
4651040	4651440	cloud.
4651440	4655440	Of course, if you're a Switch online user and do a system transfer, link your accounts
4655440	4659360	and then erase your data and then also unlink in your account.
4659360	4662800	If you forget to delete anything before trading in.
4664960	4668560	I'm sure they're going to say, well, it's because, you know, we're talking about, you
4668560	4669520	know, trading in.
4669520	4676080	If you want one of the Pikachu versions, the Diablo 3 Switch and their Smash Brothers one
4676080	4678240	too, Smash Brothers or something like that.
4678240	4680400	But like, I don't know.
4680400	4682880	I don't see people doing that necessarily like they would.
4682880	4683840	Oh, maybe Shane.
4683840	4685840	But most people would not do that.
4687440	4690880	It's a lot more money than like a 3DS, you know, or 2DS.
4690880	4691520	Yeah.
4691520	4692720	Or DS.
4692720	4695440	Can't you just get stickers to put back on the existing Switch?
4695440	4696080	You can.
4696080	4698000	You can get like just skins and stuff.
4698000	4698800	Who gives a shit?
4698800	4700320	It's just a fucking skin.
4700320	4701600	No one cares.
4701600	4702800	It's a collectible.
4702800	4708720	I mean, some people, my mother loved to collect these goblets from the Madonna Inn in San
4708720	4711280	Elizabeth, the Madonna Inn with the themed rooms and all that stuff.
4711280	4713680	For some reason, she loved these goblets.
4713680	4717280	She collected the goblets and we just like, they're, they're, they're just drink cups.
4717280	4719120	I mean, they're really pretty, but that's it.
4719120	4719840	You know what?
4719840	4722800	People collect things that they like collectors.
4722800	4726560	But the thought more, you know, the thought process is, well, maybe it's getting ready
4726560	4731120	for people to trade in their system for a newer Switch version or something.
4731120	4735200	So maybe that's going to be a thing, but I guess we'll have to wait and see because they
4735200	4740080	haven't announced anything, but it seems to be, that's kind of the rumors kind of going
4740080	4740480	that way.
4740480	4741920	How would you feel if they did do a switch?
4741920	4744240	I still feel like it's too early for one.
4744240	4748160	I'm only going to support it if they don't start locking shit out like they did with
4748160	4749200	the new 3DS.
4749200	4752640	I'm going to be pissed if there's a Switch upgrade that suddenly starts locking things
4752640	4754480	out because it's only been like two years.
4754480	4758560	It's too soon for us to get a new console that's like, Oh, it's got all these exclusives
4758560	4758800	on it.
4758800	4759200	Don't worry.
4759200	4760000	We're not going to do that.
4760000	4761120	And then we do that, you know?
4761120	4761440	Yeah.
4761440	4761680	Right.
4762240	4762960	That's what I'm.
4762960	4765280	I just don't understand what they, what they would be.
4765280	4766880	I mean, I guess upgrade the screen.
4766880	4768000	The screen's fine.
4768000	4770000	It looks nice on the 720 screen.
4770000	4772640	I mean, I don't think we really need to increase the resolution or anything.
4772640	4773360	Battery life.
4773360	4774720	Is that an issue?
4774720	4781920	More power, more graphical oomph, more chips, more rams, more memories, more on board storage.
4781920	4784240	That would be nice because 32 gigs is ridiculous.
4785920	4788800	But I don't really see, I don't know.
4788800	4790160	I don't think it's necessary.
4791040	4791600	Well, we'll see.
4792160	4793360	Nintendo's just got to tell us.
4793360	4797120	I would like another switch just so I have one that the kids don't fuck up.
4797840	4802480	I forgot to mention, so here's what I do now because they have fucked up, you know, my
4802480	4804400	red and blue, um, joy con.
4804400	4807600	So I have a set of, you know, uh, Splatoon ones.
4807600	4811760	I have the green and purple or not green, purple, green and pink.
4811760	4815680	And so I have those sitting, um, charging all the time.
4815680	4819680	And then when I go and play the system, I just take the crappy joy cons off and I put
4819680	4824160	the nice untouched joy cons on there and I play my games with that.
4824160	4828400	And then of course it put the crappy ones back on when the kids play it because I don't
4828400	4831840	know what the fuck they did to that analog sick, but it's fucked.
4832560	4837600	It is all sorts of like, I don't know, maybe if there's like crap or like dust or something
4837600	4842480	underneath it, but it drifts like I tried fixing that thing, but it's drifting all over
4842480	4843200	the fucking place.
4843200	4845520	They threw it in the bathtub when you weren't looking and throw it in the bathtub.
4845520	4850880	But it's, I, I think if it's, I think it may be dust, but I don't understand how that
4850880	4852560	thing would be affected by dust so quickly.
4852560	4854000	We've only had it since April.
4854000	4858560	I mean, it's not been that long and it's only the left sick for some reason.
4858560	4862800	And I've tried like cleaning it out, like blowing children a blessing.
4862800	4864240	I don't even know if it's children.
4864240	4867520	It's, I've seen people complain online that these things break pretty fast.
4867520	4867840	Oh yeah.
4867840	4870480	Dark to see in chat says my joy con is doing that too.
4870480	4874800	So it's just some shit on however they design it, you know, cheaply or whatever.
4874800	4875600	So I don't know.
4876160	4876480	All right.
4876480	4876880	We'll see.
4877520	4877760	All right.
4877760	4881520	Well, before we get to the classic game of the week, uh, one way that, uh, you know,
4881520	4885840	people are getting in trouble for getting their classic games out is by running ROM
4885840	4886640	websites.
4886640	4892160	And, uh, yeah, while we were out, uh, you may remember Nintendo had filed actual lawsuits
4892160	4895840	against the websites, love ROMs and love retro.
4895840	4901040	Well, apparently they've reached an agreement and there is a $12 million judgment.
4901120	4904880	Love ROM and love retro will be paying Nintendo a $12 million judgment.
4904880	4907040	How do you, how do you, how do they have $12 million?
4907040	4909520	Does that just mean like their paychecks are going to be garnished for the rest of their
4909520	4909760	lives?
4909760	4911680	Cause where are they going to come up with $12 million?
4912480	4914480	Like where, where do you like Loki?
4914480	4917760	If you got sued for $12 million, how would you pay bankruptcy?
4917760	4919440	I guess maybe that's what they plan to do.
4919440	4919840	I don't know.
4919840	4924080	I mean, you hopefully, hopefully if they're running your website like that, they had it
4924080	4929920	running under a LLC or something like that so that they're not liable for damages.
4929920	4933840	I don't think so because the defendants in this admit that their involvement with the
4933840	4938800	websites constituted direct and indirect copyright and trademark infringement, which caused Nintendo
4938800	4943440	irreparable injury plaintiff is hereby awarded judgment against all defendants jointly and
4943440	4947120	severally in the amount of $12 million, $230,000.
4947120	4947600	I am sorry.
4947600	4948720	It's actually 12.2 million.
4948720	4956320	Oh, speaking of lawsuits, I got my $10 check from the whole PlayStation three, um, other
4956320	4957520	OS lawsuit.
4957520	4958080	Oh, nice.
4958080	4958560	Yeah.
4958560	4959200	Oh, cool.
4959200	4959520	Yeah.
4959520	4960800	I forgot that was even coming.
4962080	4964080	I ain't even like Merry Christmas.
4964080	4964320	Yeah.
4964320	4965680	It's like $10.
4965680	4967200	I'll spend this in one place.
4968800	4969760	Also interesting.
4969760	4975200	They were required to sign over the ownership of love ROMs and love retro to Nintendo.
4975200	4978320	So wouldn't that be hilarious if Nintendo started using the love retro name?
4980400	4981360	We own this now.
4981920	4986000	Please give it up for our love retro collection coming up.
4986000	4989600	That would be such an asshole thing to do, but I could see it happening.
4989600	4990160	That's great.
4991040	4993520	That is a pretty good name to have love retro.
4993520	4994240	So who knows?
4995280	4996800	Just have love retro.com.
4996800	4999360	Redirect to a website on switch online.
4999360	5003360	Piracy is bad and stuff like that, but $12 million damage, please.
5004400	5005440	I think that's a bit much.
5006240	5006800	All right.
5006800	5013120	Also, Hey, if you are downloading ROMs, especially of the new stuff, be careful because, uh,
5013120	5014640	Pokemon let's go.
5014640	5018400	I mean, there is a ROM out there floating around on the internet, but, uh, there's a
5018400	5023520	fake one, a Pokemon let's go Pikachu ROM that will brick your console.
5023520	5028000	If you try to use it, it is a more sinister version of the game, which you shouldn't be
5028000	5029840	pirating the new stuff anyway.
5029840	5034800	So, you know, I probably really shouldn't even say this, but it is interesting that
5034800	5038080	people are kind of coming up with these kind of countermeasures to some of the pirates.
5038080	5043440	So Pokemon let's go Pikachu uses brick break and it was very, very effective.
5044640	5050880	I can make those Pokemon now because I played the game.
5051680	5052880	I'm aware of all this stuff.
5054720	5061440	Let's go back to a more classic time when the, the Pokemon that we sought out was missing.
5061440	5064960	No, we're going to take a step back with the classic game of the week.
5066800	5072480	And so as usual, we take a trip down memory lane and through radio magic and the use of
5072480	5076560	Skype to say hello to dark Sakura or Jamie Summers with us on the line.
5076560	5077280	Hello, Jamie.
5078320	5079120	Hello.
5079120	5080080	How are you doing?
5081520	5082400	I am okay.
5082400	5083120	How are you?
5083120	5083440	Good.
5083440	5085360	I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving.
5086480	5087360	It was pretty good.
5087360	5090480	It was nice and chill, which is what I was hoping for.
5090480	5090720	All right.
5090720	5093520	But literally chill because you guys are up in Tahoe, right?
5094720	5096320	Yes, it was snowing.
5096320	5101120	There was snow on the beach, which was actually kind of weird for me, but very cool.
5101120	5102720	Snow in California.
5103360	5103840	Get out.
5104960	5106560	We have high elevation here.
5106560	5106880	It does.
5106880	5108320	It has been known to happen anyway.
5109520	5110800	It's the classic game of the week time.
5110800	5116080	Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and says, Hey, this game, you should
5116080	5117120	be thankful for this.
5117840	5123280	Dark Sakura picked a, this is an interesting one because it's like, it's a modern take
5123280	5128480	on a classic game, but it does qualify under the 10 years or older criteria, believe it
5128480	5129040	or not, right?
5129280	5130880	That it does.
5130880	5133760	Cause it came out in September of 2008.
5133760	5134160	There it is.
5134160	5137280	So it's a, this is one of those feel old yet type of games.
5137280	5138800	Cause it is 10 years old this year.
5138800	5140000	What is the classic game of the week?
5141200	5142080	Mega Man nine.
5148080	5148800	Mega Man nine.
5149440	5154080	They were using chip tunes and Mega Man nine, but this was on the 360 and the Wii.
5155600	5155920	Yep.
5155920	5157200	There's more to this.
5157200	5157920	Okay.
5157920	5168960	So, um, it was developed by Capcom and NTCreates and it is the first original Mega Man series
5168960	5174960	game since Mega Man eight and Mega Man and base or Rockman and Forte, uh, that came out
5174960	5176400	about a decade before this one.
5177040	5183840	Um, it is also the first game in the series to not have a truly physical first release.
5184560	5191360	Um, it was downloadable using, uh, WiiWare and PlayStation network and Xbox five arcade.
5192080	5199600	It was now since 2017 that it would have a physical release with the release of Mega
5199600	5204880	Man legacy, legacy collection two for PS4, Xbox one and PC and the digital version that
5204880	5208400	came out on the switch in 2018 in may.
5209360	5214480	So basically it continues the adventures of, uh, Mega Man or Rockman.
5215120	5220720	And so Dr. Light is blamed for Dr. Wily's, uh, evil.
5222560	5229360	And so Mega Man goes into stop the robots to prove his creator's innocence and to show
5229360	5231760	that it's Wily who's a bad guy.
5231760	5236240	So it is old school 2D platforming Mega Man action.
5237040	5244880	Um, it was developed for modern console, but was required to go in an 8-bit and a visual
5244880	5250320	and audio style like the NES, uh, Inafune Kenji, uh, Keiji, sorry.
5250320	5256880	And, um, Takeshita, um, Hironobu who were the development team, um, you know, behind
5256880	5262320	those, uh, well, they were the producers, but they instructed the development team to
5262320	5265760	stick to the likeness and style of Mega Man 2.
5266240	5273040	Which came on 1988 and it was a pretty big success and it prompted them to also come
5273040	5275440	out with Mega Man 10, uh, soon after.
5276480	5281760	So this was also something that took place in year 20XX.
5282880	5288480	And it is also the first game that create, that had a female robot master.
5288480	5290880	This was the game that Flash Woman showed up in.
5290880	5297440	Um, and of course in the robot order that you're supposed to fight in, you know, the
5297440	5300320	advised robot order, he's the first on the list.
5300320	5302480	So guess who happened to see them?
5302480	5303120	It's versatile.
5304160	5314960	Um, as I was saying, it did follow the style visually and audio for, um, Mega Man 2, um,
5314960	5316960	that was used as the benchmark for it.
5316960	5322240	It also did have downloadable content for the game that one of them would allow you
5322240	5327280	to play as Proto Man, which he can slide, charge his blaster and take double the damage
5327280	5328160	of Mega Man.
5329040	5336320	Um, you also could get higher difficulty and endless stage and, um, a new special box called
5336320	5336880	Fake Man.
5337680	5345760	So, um, in, uh, the later release came out in Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, instead of
5345760	5350720	it being DLC, you had secret codes that will allow you to unlock the DLC content.
5352000	5357920	Um, uh, as I said, it was developed by Capcom and Inti Creates.
5357920	5365200	Inti Creates had developed, uh, Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX, um, spin-offs and had previous
5365200	5368480	Capcom team members who had worked on other Mega Man games.
5368800	5374800	Um, the first, uh, six games in the original Mega Man series were made for NES.
5375520	5381120	There were a bunch of spin-offs, of course, like Mega Man 8, and then the Mega Man, uh,
5381120	5386480	8 and Rockman 4K were, uh, brought out on other home consoles later.
5386480	5394240	But, you know, Hunie, um, was, of course, um, down to create, you know, something that
5394240	5400320	was a throwback to the superior old school, but that its creation would highly depend
5400320	5402640	on the input of fans, and that was a quote from him.
5403520	5408240	Um, he said that the simple fun of a Mega Man game does not fit into the grandiose,
5408240	5411360	expansive world of the consumer gaming industry has become.
5411360	5414560	She has to make games that match the current expectations.
5414560	5418560	And so he really wanted to go back to how it was supposed to be.
5418560	5424160	And the rise of retro gaming, especially on services like Virtual Console, basically
5424160	5425920	made Mega Man 9 possible.
5425920	5427280	People wanted the old school.
5427920	5435840	Um, the audio was, uh, composed by Yamada Ippo, um, uh, Kawakami Ryo, uh, Shimodo Yu,
5435840	5438400	and Isogai, um, Hiroki.
5439280	5445600	Um, they were all people who had, um, big input, and some of them were actually veteran
5445600	5447200	composers like Yamada.
5447200	5452320	Um, he had been a composer for Capcom and worked with what he called a series of a sense
5452320	5453120	of nostalgia.
5454080	5461440	And that, um, Shimodo Yu actually analyzed the audio of the NES Mega Man games so that
5461440	5463440	he could be as authentic to it as possible.
5464400	5468400	Um, as I said, it came out in 2008.
5468400	5474240	It was fully announced as Mega Man 9 in July 2008, and the details were announced in a
5474240	5477440	Weekly Hamitsu and Nintendo Power.
5478400	5485520	Um, it was supposed to be exclusive to WiiWare, but there, of course, you know, after, you
5485520	5491200	know, prompting from the fans, they, uh, brought out Xbox Live Arcade and PSN copies.
5491920	5500240	Um, there also were, um, mobile phone incarnations that were released in Japan in late 2010.
5500960	5508000	Uh, promotional artwork for it was done by I Am 8-Bit that was supposed to be reminiscent
5508000	5516640	of the really bad art we got here in the US, so the marketing campaign was meant to reflect
5516640	5517140	that.
5517760	5526800	And, um, it also was put out with, uh, you know, uh, you could get, like, a custom box
5526800	5528400	that had that artwork on it and everything.
5528400	5530160	It was pretty, pretty crazy.
5530160	5534800	And then they did, um, for other promotional stuff, there was the Ski Tank energy drinks
5534800	5540400	into CD soundtracks, and that came out also in September 2008.
5540400	5542160	It was pretty well received.
5542160	5543440	Everyone was super happy.
5544240	5551520	Um, they did not release the financial figures, but said that they were cautiously optimistic
5551520	5557520	about its performance on WiiWare and on the other, uh, consoles, and actually, it got
5557520	5565840	pretty decent ratings, um, except by, like, one UK group called OPM, but they don't count.
5567520	5568720	Who cares what they think?
5568720	5575120	There was an arcade comics, um, series, and, um, the series would go on hiatus before it
5575120	5580880	could do the full storyline, but they did release Splash Woman and Concrete Man early,
5581600	5583600	um, in the, the series.
5583600	5590480	And then there was, uh, um, another new character in the series called Vesper Woman, um, but
5590480	5593200	I don't recall if she ever made it into one of the games.
5593760	5594960	And that was it.
5594960	5596400	That's Mega Man 9.
5596400	5599120	You know, it's interesting that you say the Splash Woman is the one that you're supposed
5599120	5602240	to fight first, because I noticed in this, um, long play that we're using to get the
5602240	5605440	background music, they also took on Splash Woman first, which you might have heard the
5605440	5609360	background music there, but I, I think this is one of those games where there's kind of
5609360	5613200	multiple paths through, because I seem to remember Galaxy Man was the one that I was
5613200	5614320	told to start with.
5614320	5616480	Not Splash Woman, that was towards the end.
5616480	5622400	But, you know, in Mega Man 2, I know some people would start with Metal Man, some people
5622400	5626880	would start with Flash Man, so it's probably one of those games where there's, you know,
5626880	5630240	multiple ways through it, just depending on who you're com- there's probably a certain
5630240	5633920	loop through it, but it's all about who are you most comfortable taking on with just the
5633920	5634800	arm cannon, you know?
5636000	5638480	Well, it's who has the biggest weakness to who.
5638960	5642720	I always did start with Mega Man first, because his weapon was much versatile.
5642720	5644480	You mean, you mean Metal Man?
5645600	5648240	Metal Man, yeah, sorry, I started with Metal Man first.
5648240	5648800	Yeah.
5648800	5651840	Because he was in, and 2, because he was the most versatile.
5653520	5657360	But, like, everyone's got their own weakness, like, Splash Woman's primary weakness is the
5657360	5659120	Hornet Chaser from Hornet Man.
5659120	5659620	Yeah.
5660480	5668000	Concrete Man's weakness is the Laser Trident, and he said Splash Woman is also secondarily
5668000	5669680	weak to the Mega Buster.
5669680	5670480	Oh, interesting.
5670480	5678240	Whereas other ones are not necessarily weak to those other- to the Mega Buster, although
5678240	5678800	it will work.
5679680	5684160	Interesting, yeah, no, I swear there was a path in 2 where you can start with Metal Man,
5684160	5687440	was kind of a common one, but you could do Flash Man, then you go Flash Man to Quick
5687440	5691920	Man, and you use the time stopper on Quick Man, and it saps like a third of his health,
5691920	5695280	but that means you have to kill the rest of them with the Buster, it's not quite as easy.
5695280	5697360	But once you kind of get past that, the rest of it's keg.
5698400	5705200	Well, I always did Quick Man pretty much last, because I would, um, I never liked his stage,
5705200	5705840	first of all.
5705840	5706240	Yeah.
5706240	5707440	I wasn't very good at it.
5708480	5715040	There were some that would tell you to start off with, you know, Air Man, which I was like,
5715040	5715540	why?
5716480	5720480	But my- my first three, I would always do Metal Man first, and then I would switch between
5720480	5722320	either doing Flash Man or Crash Man first.
5722320	5724640	Yeah, I like the ones that have a little more versatility.
5724640	5729040	So anyway, I didn't mean to make a Mega Man 9 discussion about Mega Man 2, but, I mean,
5729040	5729600	since-
5729600	5731600	But it wasn't put after it, you know?
5731600	5737360	Yeah, this game was meant to evoke the feeling of, you know, when Mega Man was at its, you
5737360	5741920	know, peak for most people, which was arguably Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3, I think a lot-
5741920	5746400	I mean, you're gonna get some Mega Man fans that are like, but I love 5, 4 is the best,
5746400	5750880	you know, and that's- that's fine, but I think generally, it was probably at its peak with
5750880	5753520	Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3, for most people.
5753520	5754080	Yeah.
5754080	5754580	Yeah.
5755120	5762720	Mega Man 2, just, I don't want to miss with people I know, is, I would say, fairly considered
5762720	5766720	to be the pinnacle of the series, and the rest were all really good, but Mega Man 2
5766720	5769680	is usually when people have the biggest fond memories of.
5769680	5773840	Yeah, and then there's so much of two in three, because you go back and you fight all the
5773840	5778240	two bosses in three, that like, it's hard to ignore that three in some ways feels like
5778240	5782160	the superior game, but I'm not gonna start that argument, that's probably already going
5782160	5784800	in our chat room, but anyway, we got to get back to the show.
5784800	5790480	But there it is, your classic game of the week, Mega Man 9, which believe it or not,
5790480	5795280	is 10 years old, even though it feels a lot older, but maybe some people experiencing
5795280	5801360	it relatively recently due to the Mega Man collection part 2 that had like 7, 8, 9, and
5801360	5802880	10 all in one collection.
5802880	5805360	I know some people get into it that way.
5805360	5810320	So anyway, Dark Sakura, we look forward to having you back in studio soon, and hopefully
5810320	5814240	before the year is out, and we might be on our Twitch thing.
5814240	5818480	I think we only got about one or two more Shoutcast shows in us, then we're gonna make
5818480	5820080	that big transition, so it's gonna be fun.
5821280	5826800	We'll see what happens, but yeah, for now though, I mean, I have to save up some time
5826800	5828240	off and see if I can.
5828240	5833040	All right, well, glad you had a good Thanksgiving, Dark Sakura, and we'll talk to you next time.
5833040	5837040	Any parting words for our listeners tonight before we go back to the live show?
5838560	5839600	Coffee is wonderful.
5840800	5847040	Coffee is wonderful.
5847040	5848560	I just had a cup before the show.
5848560	5853120	Hey, we're back live with Orange Launch Radio continuing on here.
5853120	5857520	Episode number 753 for this November the 25th of 2018.
5857520	5860560	Loki joining me here in studio, of course.
5860560	5861360	Hello, Loki.
5861360	5861760	Hello.
5861760	5862480	What were you doing?
5862480	5864080	Were you playing a game over there during the break?
5864080	5866000	I thought you were Pokemon going, weren't you?
5866000	5869680	I was doing Pokemon Go stuff, and then I was putting my calories for today.
5869680	5870320	Oh, okay.
5870320	5870880	Well, that's good.
5871600	5873280	You still do really good on all that health stuff.
5873280	5873760	Good for you.
5873760	5878560	Yeah, this weekend I haven't really been paying attention to my diet too much, but I haven't
5878560	5880800	gained anything, so it's been fine.
5880800	5881600	It's Thanksgiving.
5881600	5882160	It doesn't count.
5882160	5886320	Well, last week it was all kind of screwy anyways because it was raining and because
5886320	5891360	I had fucked up my foot earlier in the week, so I tried walking on it, and that only screwed
5891360	5896800	up the side of my calf instead because I was kind of walking on the outside of my foot,
5896800	5901280	and even though the bottom of my foot wasn't hurting as much anymore, the side of my foot
5901280	5905760	was just like that muscle just got tensed up and winged.
5905760	5907280	Getting old sucks, huh?
5907280	5908160	I guess, yeah.
5908160	5914560	So I was hobbling around with that, but hopefully I feel fine enough to play DDR again this
5914560	5915680	week, so I'm going to do that.
5915680	5916400	I hope so.
5916400	5916640	Yeah.
5916640	5917040	I hope so.
5917040	5918000	I want to come over and play...
5918960	5920640	Oh, Nick, please, not so quick and do it all night.
5920640	5922720	Yeah, we need to pick a day or something.
5923840	5924880	Maybe the weekend or something.
5924880	5925440	We'll make that work.
5925440	5931120	Well, also joining us virtually via Skype, we're welcoming an old friend back to the
5931120	5935200	show here who is celebrating a classic game of his own a little bit this week.
5935200	5937200	Hey, YYR, are you there on the line with us?
5938080	5939920	Oh, Nick, please, not so quick.
5939920	5940480	Oh, my favorite.
5940480	5941600	That song is my jam.
5941600	5943520	That was the song that really made me fall in love with DDR.
5944560	5946320	This song is so over the top.
5947120	5948000	It's pretty ridiculous.
5948000	5950560	It's ridiculous, yeah, as video games should be.
5950560	5952080	Video games should be over the top ridiculous.
5952080	5952720	Those are my favorites.
5952720	5953360	A little bit.
5953360	5954560	How are you doing, YYR?
5955440	5958320	I'm actually doing pretty well.
5958320	5962480	Yeah, I actually was just playing In the Groove earlier and I passed Hardcore of the North,
5962480	5968480	which was ridiculous because that has more steps than any other In the Groove single
5968480	5970240	expert official chart.
5970240	5971440	So that was cool.
5971440	5972240	I was not aware.
5972240	5977040	I really would love to play Kyle's new Step Maniacs game at some point, though.
5977680	5980960	I think it's doing really well overseas, like in Germany.
5980960	5984640	I keep seeing on his Facebook, I sold another 5,000 machines in Germany.
5984640	5985520	I'm making these numbers up.
5985520	5988160	But you know, it's like his game is huge in Germany.
5988160	5990640	He's like, he made the David Hasselhoff of video games.
5991680	5993280	Well, I'll say this much.
5993280	5996320	We do have a machine in New Jersey at 8 on the break.
5996320	5996960	Of course.
5996960	5999200	And I have gotten to play on it.
5999200	6003520	And I mean, if you like to play double, it's lacking in content right now.
6003520	6008000	But in every other respect, it feels very polished, very fun to play.
6008000	6013520	And I apologize for any baby screaming in the background because she's very excited
6013520	6013920	right now.
6013920	6015360	Don't apologize for that.
6015360	6016800	And 8 on the break.
6016800	6018160	I've been there.
6018160	6019200	It was many years ago.
6019200	6020480	It was many, many years ago.
6020480	6023920	But my favorite arcade in New Jersey, the only one I've been to.
6023920	6024640	I'll say that.
6024640	6025040	Free plug.
6025040	6026400	Not much has changed either.
6026400	6029440	They still have delicious break steaks at the bar.
6029440	6035680	And yeah, classic games all over the place and a lot of music games.
6035680	6040320	Well, speaking of classic games, YYR, you're kind of calling in a bit tonight because you're
6040320	6041840	celebrating an anniversary.
6041840	6045360	Obviously, you've been celebrating a lot of new changes in your life with your new child
6045360	6048880	and all, but you're kind of celebrating a big birthday as well, right?
6049440	6050960	Yeah, something like that.
6050960	6054240	So on November 20th, 2008.
6055120	6060480	Actually, I think it was November 19th that this thing launched the Xbox Live Community
6060480	6064880	Games, which then was later renamed to Xbox Live Indie Games.
6064880	6068400	And then on November 20th, Snake 360 came out.
6069200	6071280	So yeah, it's been 10 years.
6071280	6074560	So are you here to lobby for Snake 360 to be a Classic Game of the Week?
6074560	6076000	Because I don't think January would wear.
6076000	6076320	I don't know.
6076320	6076720	We'll see.
6076720	6077120	We'll see.
6077840	6078720	I don't know about that.
6078720	6085120	That's, that would be, you know, pretty epic to make it onto Orange Lounge Radio Classic
6085120	6085840	Game of the Week.
6085840	6093280	But, you know, I'm not going to have any delusions of grandeur, but no, it's Switch version when
6093280	6094000	I see in chat.
6094000	6095040	Thanks, Dr. Tetsuya.
6096560	6100400	That's when you know you've made it because everybody will ask on your AMA on Reddit.
6100480	6102560	Switch version when it's for begging.
6102560	6106240	If you get Switch port begging you, you may in fact have made it.
6106240	6107920	Yes, absolutely.
6107920	6109280	Well, 10 years later.
6109280	6114160	So I mean, I guess the kind of sad thing is obviously the Xbox Indie Games as we know
6114160	6118160	it from before no longer exists, but they kind of they kind of brought it back in a
6118160	6119040	different form, right?
6120080	6124480	So it's called the Xbox Live Creators Program.
6125040	6132880	And if you go, if you have an Xbox One and you go to the store underneath all of the,
6132880	6136080	you know, sale, boom, AAA stuff.
6136080	6139600	Yeah, you're going to find this little tab that says Creators Collection.
6139600	6143600	And if you go in there, you're going to find this, you know, little sectioned off, kind
6143600	6145440	of like Xbox Live Indie Games was.
6146400	6151360	But nonetheless, you're going to find a bunch of stuff in there that is not rated by the
6151360	6158720	ESRB and does not have achievements or online play, but otherwise, you know, is put together
6158720	6163280	by, you know, hobbyists or, you know, people that couldn't get approved for the independent
6163280	6164240	developer program.
6165440	6170720	Just, you know, some fun stuff that was approved by Microsoft for release and that you can
6170720	6173120	buy just like Xbox Live Indie Games.
6174000	6177200	But unfortunately, the Xbox Live Indie Games didn't cross over.
6177200	6180080	So it's like Snake 360 unavailable on this, right?
6180800	6181360	That's right.
6181360	6183520	None of the old games made it.
6183520	6189680	The only chance that the old games make it over is if the developer decides to republish
6189680	6189920	it.
6189920	6195840	And, you know, they can't just go because some things have changed, things like how
6195840	6201840	the game save files, because if you think about it, you know, Xbox One works a lot differently
6201840	6203520	than 360 in that regard.
6203520	6208560	You don't have, you know, all you can have a hard drive or a storage unit or, you know,
6208640	6211440	USB or whatever Xbox work.
6211440	6216400	The Xbox One works with cloud saves and they follow you everywhere and some different work
6216400	6217680	has to be done to enable that.
6217680	6219360	And I am looking into it, by the way.
6221360	6221760	Nice.
6223040	6229680	I'm actually hoping to release my first title on the Creator's Collection probably in the
6229680	6232800	next couple of months, and that's going to be Falling Plus.
6233520	6237200	I think honestly, Falling Plus is like my Ridge Racer.
6237520	6241440	I'm releasing it on every platform that I want to be on to get my feet wet.
6241440	6243440	And then after that, the other stuff will come.
6244240	6247040	Falling is kind of your ode to like 80s classics, right?
6247040	6247760	I've played that one.
6247760	6249600	It's kind of a fun little puzzler.
6249600	6253600	Feels like something that would have been in an arcade in the 80s.
6254320	6256480	That's exactly the vibe I was going for.
6256480	6260000	It's, you know, basically, I mean, I'm thinking Bubble Bobble.
6260000	6265600	It doesn't quite have that level of complexity, but, you know, it's basically like, you know,
6265600	6269920	you're a penguin, the walrus is trying to bust in and colored blocks are falling from
6269920	6270480	the ceiling.
6271120	6273680	Of course, later levels, this happens faster.
6273680	6276800	But what you're doing is you're matching colors to clear the blocks.
6276800	6280320	And of course, every so often the walrus is going to get in your way and you have to kind
6280320	6284080	of crush him, smash him against another block, and so on.
6284080	6284880	Poor walrus.
6286560	6286800	Yeah.
6289040	6293360	Let me ask this, like, now, you know, we're 10 years after you putting out, you know,
6293360	6294720	Snake 360.
6294720	6301520	What have you kind of learned about gaming through this whole, the gaming yourself, the
6301520	6302080	indie games?
6302080	6305840	What have you learned through this whole experience of putting a game out and, you know, continuing
6305840	6310720	to, as a hobbyist, you know, put games out because obviously, you know, we were big fans
6310720	6311120	of Bungie.
6311120	6312720	Ferretossing on 360 as well.
6314000	6318480	You know, we still stand by Super Multitasking as a game that, and thank you for that.
6318480	6320720	Breakthrough is coming any day now on Steam.
6321120	6325440	And by the way, it's on sale for 20% off at the moment as part of the Steam Autumn sale.
6325440	6326000	There you go.
6326000	6327040	Which does end soon.
6327920	6329280	Cheap plug, but I approve.
6330320	6334480	Going to chat, ssh100mad, does Falling Plus have a kill screen?
6334480	6335920	No, sadly it does not.
6337280	6337920	Bummer.
6337920	6338400	That's okay.
6338400	6341840	Maybe, maybe Falling Plus Plus second mix new stage.
6343760	6346800	But one thing, okay, so what have I learned?
6347360	6355280	So I mean, Snake 360, I put 11 really hard months of development into.
6355280	6360080	I don't think I've ever worked so hard on anything ever, including at my job.
6360080	6361280	So sorry, job.
6362160	6369440	But definitely I learned that however hard you think it is to actually put a game together
6369440	6374880	and release it, multiply that by probably around between 5 and 10.
6374880	6376000	And that's how hard it is.
6377520	6381200	I mean, and most of it comes with, you know, the part at the end.
6381760	6385200	Because it's one thing to get a game working.
6385200	6385920	That's easy.
6385920	6386960	That's the easy part.
6386960	6388240	That's the fun part.
6388240	6393360	You know, you put together your concept and it's like, hey, I can play this and it's fun.
6393360	6394720	Great, I'm done.
6394720	6396240	No, no, you're not done.
6396240	6400800	Because now what you have to do is you have to make sure it works at a variety of different
6400800	6401760	resolutions.
6401760	6406400	Because if you're releasing on PC, you don't want to be told, well, you have to run this
6406400	6408480	at 720p widescreen.
6408480	6412240	No, no, actually you want to run it at whatever resolution you want.
6412880	6415680	And maybe you want it to work with controllers.
6415680	6420800	Well, okay, now test it with the Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers and the DualShock
6420800	6426240	4 and the Steam controller and the Switch Pro controller and make sure it works perfectly
6426240	6427040	with all of those.
6427040	6431120	And if you're releasing a Mac version, make sure it works with all of those controllers
6431120	6432320	on Mac also.
6432320	6434400	Man, this QA testing is the worst.
6434400	6435920	That's why Bethesda doesn't bother.
6437360	6437860	Right.
6440560	6441280	But no, you're right.
6442000	6444720	I mean, not that that should stop people from making their own game for sure, but there
6444720	6447440	is a lot more that goes into it that people don't realize.
6448400	6451200	The polish is really the hardest part.
6451200	6457920	And not just because you have to be very thorough, but also because it's not the exciting part.
6457920	6461840	The exciting part is putting your game together and seeing it come to life.
6462160	6470320	The most amazing part of super multitasking was making it to the point where I had enough
6470320	6475440	minigames that I could create the algorithm that starts and stops the minigames.
6475440	6481600	That magic when it first worked and when I realized the concept was fun, that was magic.
6481600	6482560	That was awesome.
6482560	6483520	That was amazing.
6483520	6486880	I lit up like a Christmas tree and I don't even celebrate Christmas.
6487200	6494560	So, but, you know, then it's like the actual work of getting the game ready for release.
6495200	6497200	It's many, many times that.
6497200	6502320	And Black Wolf in chat says the last 10% of development takes 90% of the time.
6502320	6504000	And he's pretty much right.
6504720	6509120	And also, he said the part YYR is talking about is the part where Loki quits.
6509760	6511520	No, he didn't even get that far, but yeah.
6511520	6512020	Yeah.
6512020	6518020	I remember I can't even get far enough to mod a stupid theme for set mania.
6518020	6518340	Okay.
6518340	6520500	Like I was watching YouTube instead of the day.
6520500	6523860	Bobby's used that quote before and I've heard that, you know,
6523860	6526660	similar iterations of that quite a bit when it comes to game development.
6526660	6527620	It's very true.
6527620	6528180	Definitely.
6528180	6528820	So what's next?
6528820	6533460	And box 006 is just quickly reminding us that Bethesda does do QA testing.
6533460	6534740	It's just done by the gamers.
6536820	6537540	Let's be fair.
6537540	6539140	Bethesda does QA testing.
6539140	6541940	It's just Bethesda exacts a fucking ship it anyways.
6541940	6542420	Yeah, exactly.
6542420	6545620	The boardroom decisions are usually like, eh, it's not that big a deal.
6545620	6546580	Gamers will buy it anyway.
6547220	6548580	What's next for you?
6548580	6551220	What are you gonna use this 10 year of experience in the future?
6552900	6560420	Well, honestly, I'm not looking forward another 10 years so much as this next year.
6560420	6563460	And it is a lot more difficult with a baby around.
6564100	6568500	But I think what I'm really gonna try to do is build my brand or attempt to
6568500	6575220	over the next year by expanding my offerings on more platforms.
6575940	6579860	And, you know, just to let everybody know.
6580740	6587380	So the beginning of that is I'm moving Falling Plus from itch.io where it's been to Steam.
6588020	6591940	It's actually releasing in five days on November 30th.
6591940	6593380	Oh, shoot.
6593380	6594100	There you go.
6594100	6595220	Very timely announcement.
6595220	6597860	People might be listening to this on November 30th.
6598580	6602820	Well, if you're listening right now and you're in the chat room, the first thing I'm going
6602820	6608580	to do when I get off this call is anybody who is in the chat room is going to receive
6608580	6610580	a Steam key for this game.
6610580	6611080	What?
6611780	6612500	That's awesome.
6612500	6613860	You get Falling Plus.
6613860	6615540	And you get Falling Plus.
6615540	6617140	And you get Falling Plus.
6617140	6618420	You all get Falling Plus.
6619220	6620340	Oh, ho ho ho.
6620340	6621780	It's the holiday spirit.
6621780	6622660	I love it.
6622660	6623460	That's amazing.
6624100	6626500	Everybody in the chat room is getting a free game tonight.
6626500	6627140	That's great.
6627620	6629060	That's very generous of you, Santa.
6629060	6629780	I appreciate that.
6629780	6631540	And you don't even celebrate Christmas.
6631540	6633060	But still, the holiday spirit.
6633060	6633940	It's all there.
6633940	6635460	Hey, it could be for Hanukkah, too.
6636500	6641220	Mind you, if you're listening on the podcast feed, it's not, you know, all for naught.
6641220	6647780	If you send me an email at yyr at yyrgames.com and mention OLR, you will get one as well.
6647780	6648420	What?
6648420	6649780	That's crazy.
6649780	6650660	That's amazing.
6650660	6653460	You might want to put a deadline on that, though, so that people don't go like, hey.
6654260	6656100	You have until the next episode is on.
6656100	6656900	Post a form.
6656900	6657300	Yeah.
6657300	6660180	If you don't recognize a name, yyr, I need to run it by me.
6660180	6664100	If you start getting flooded with all these emails from, like, other countries, I pretty
6664100	6666820	much know who all the listeners in other countries are at this point.
6667460	6668420	So I'll let you know.
6669380	6670660	That's awesome.
6670660	6671300	So, yeah.
6671300	6673620	Everybody in the chat room is very jazzed about this.
6674580	6678420	Boncival06 says, yyr coming in with the gift for all the girls and boys.
6679140	6679540	Let's see.
6680340	6680740	Okay.
6680740	6683060	I like some of these other questions coming in, too.
6683060	6686260	Oh, BlackWolf wants to know, is it unlocked now or does it unlock on the 30th?
6686900	6688820	These are pre-release redemption codes.
6688820	6689940	You can play it right away.
6689940	6691380	That's awesome.
6691380	6692420	That is so great.
6692420	6693620	Okay, cool.
6693620	6698340	And I think if you if you want to give me money and pay for the game, then feel free
6698340	6699940	to pass the code on to somebody else.
6700500	6702900	That's that's so awesome of you to do.
6702900	6704340	And actually, let's see.
6704340	6707140	Well, before I get to that, S2100Matt is asking a question.
6707140	6708020	I think this is really good.
6708660	6712340	What are your thoughts on the Intellivision Amico and would you try to get your games
6712340	6713300	on the console?
6713300	6719300	You know, Amico is a very unique type of platform that might be kind of trying to cater itself
6719300	6724020	to more like, you know, developers that are well, first off, they'd have to be exclusive
6724020	6724340	games.
6724340	6727300	But I suppose you could always do a falling plus plus or you know what I mean?
6727940	6732900	But I mean, since you try to invoke 80s classics, I could see where something like Intellivision
6732900	6733780	might be right up your alley.
6734900	6741300	So it's funny that you ask that, because remember I said I'm trying to build my brand.
6742020	6745300	So there's a multiple pronged approach here.
6746500	6749300	I am going to be releasing falling plus on Steam.
6750020	6755700	The next thing I'm going to be working on after a super multitasking update is I'm officially
6755700	6757860	announcing Bungee Ferret Tossing Turbo.
6759060	6760820	That will be coming to Steam next.
6760820	6763060	Yay, Bungee Ferret Tossing is coming back.
6764260	6765300	So exciting.
6765300	6766100	For those that don't know.
6766100	6767460	Improved graphics.
6767460	6770500	In case we do have some newer listeners out there, for those who don't know, Bungee Ferret
6770500	6775540	Tossing was a game YYR made based off a conversation that happened on Orange Lounge Radio.
6775540	6777780	We were talking about one of our many dream games.
6777780	6781700	YYR made a dream game here on Orange Lounge Radio a reality, which is amazing.
6782980	6788420	And yes, Bobby Black Wolf, it will have the Wolf News segment, although you are not the
6788420	6788980	villain, no.
6790660	6796580	But yes, it'll feature improved graphics and also an arranged mode where not only can you
6796580	6801540	add turbo speed to it, but also you can unlock all kinds of fun things that will allow you
6801540	6803620	to tweak the gameplay and break it.
6805300	6807060	But yeah, so please look forward to that.
6807060	6809940	I'm hoping to ship it sometime first quarter of next year.
6811380	6817540	And then once I have that stuff on Steam, I'm also planning to try to release this stuff
6817540	6819540	on Windows 10 and Xbox One.
6820900	6826340	Now, I'm hoping to have all that stuff done and possibly a re-release of Snake by the
6826340	6827620	middle of next year.
6827620	6829460	Guess what happens the middle of next year?
6831220	6834100	The Intellivision Amico dev kits become available.
6834900	6841940	Now, I am racking my brain when I lay down to sleep, when I'm in the shower, when I'm
6841940	6843380	doing other things.
6843380	6850500	I'm racking my brain trying to come up with some good game concepts, not just to make
6850580	6856980	a game, but to make a game that will play very well on that weirdo controller that they're
6857620	6858900	shipping with the Amico.
6861460	6864820	And I wish I could come up with something really great.
6864820	6865620	And you know what?
6865620	6870500	I have a couple of beginnings right now, but I'm still working it out.
6870500	6874500	And I actually think I'm going to pick up in an old Intellivision just so I can get
6874500	6878180	more of a sense for what the dial is going to feel like.
6878980	6884420	You might be the first dev I've heard on a show lobbying to make an Intellivision game.
6886660	6887860	Well, here's the thing.
6887860	6890900	If you look at the specs, first of all, it has to be something original.
6890900	6891940	That's fine.
6891940	6894500	Second of all, it has to be between three and eight bucks.
6894500	6896500	All my games are between three and eight bucks.
6897060	6897460	All right.
6899860	6906180	They're looking probably to put, you know, retro inspired, short burst types of gameplay.
6906180	6907220	That's what I do.
6907860	6913380	It seems to me like it would be silly for me not to try it.
6913380	6915380	Yeah, we're going to help however we can.
6915380	6916180	I mean, we've not.
6916180	6917620	I mean, Tommy is a busy guy.
6917620	6918660	He's been on the show before.
6918660	6919460	We have an email.
6919460	6920340	So, you know, you never know.
6920340	6920740	You never know.
6920740	6921380	We can.
6921380	6923460	We'll try to help you out best we can.
6923460	6924980	So that's great.
6924980	6925380	Thank you.
6925940	6932660	I really appreciate you given that doing that Oprah moment with falling for all of our chatters
6932660	6933780	and listeners.
6933780	6934980	It's really, really great.
6934980	6936500	It's the least that I can do.
6936500	6941220	I mean, not only do you guys plug my stuff at every opportunity, but you've also provided
6941220	6945060	me with all of this entertainment over the last, you know, over ten years.
6945060	6947700	You do what you do because you love video games.
6947700	6949540	We do what we do because we love video games.
6950740	6952660	We all kind of contributed in our own way.
6952660	6954260	Hey, Bobby wants to know if he can stream.
6954260	6958900	If there's an embargo on streaming or if he can just stream it after OLR tonight.
6959540	6960500	Yeah, you can go ahead.
6960500	6961140	All right.
6961140	6966100	You know, just mention it's coming out in a few days and that's it.
6966900	6967940	He'll work in your plug.
6967940	6968420	You're good.
6969300	6969800	Awesome.
6970340	6973380	But yeah, just finishing up the Amico business.
6975300	6980420	You know, going back to Snake 360, another thing that I did learn is that when you have
6980420	6983780	a young marketplace, there are more eyeballs looking at it.
6983780	6989780	The most money I ever made off of one of my games was when Snake 360 just came out and
6989780	6993300	there were fewer games on the store and there were lots of eyeballs looking at this brand
6993300	6994580	new thing that just came out.
6994580	6996260	Hey, so you know what's funny?
6996260	6997700	You know, it's funny why we are.
6997700	7000260	Do you know when OLR had the most listeners ever?
7001460	7004260	When it was new, the week iTunes podcasting launched.
7006100	7007620	Yeah, we make perfect sense.
7007620	7010020	Remember, this show existed well before then.
7010020	7014180	We had the to go edition that was on when you had to use like Lemon Potter and all that.
7014180	7018020	All those other apps to podcasts on your iPod because there weren't even the phones yet.
7018020	7019220	So this show existed back then.
7019220	7024020	So the week we were on the store, I think there's maybe only like one or two other gaming
7024020	7028900	podcasts that exist today that were on the store when iTunes launched that.
7028900	7030740	And we've never been bigger.
7030740	7033860	And honestly and humbly, we'll probably never be that big again.
7035300	7037860	But that's what you know what I'm I'm just hoping.
7037860	7041380	I mean, I haven't been that big since since Snake 360.
7041380	7047460	And I'm just hoping that, you know, basically the reason I'm trying to build the brand,
7047460	7050660	you know, release a few games on Steam, release a few games on Xbox.
7051220	7053940	It's like I'm hoping that this is what happens.
7055460	7059700	YYR Games is announced as one of the first developers on Amico.
7059700	7060740	Who the heck is that?
7061300	7062820	They look into me.
7062820	7064580	Oh, they have a few games available.
7064580	7066020	Hey, this looks interesting.
7066020	7067140	Click, click, click, bye.
7068340	7071700	So maybe, maybe, maybe it'll happen.
7071700	7072500	Maybe not.
7072500	7074660	But it's worth a shot, right?
7074660	7077940	Hey, if we're rooting for anybody here at OLR YYR, it's you.
7077940	7079700	We want to we want to see it happen for you.
7079780	7080980	So you you deserve it.
7080980	7083300	And not just because you hand our listeners free stuff.
7083300	7086500	You know, we've supported your your stuff anyway.
7086500	7090420	So I I really wish you the success and I do hope we get to see your name on television
7090420	7093220	splash screen, you know, in a year or so.
7093220	7094260	So thank you.
7095300	7098740	I will address Bonds006 speaking of the free stuff.
7098740	7101460	He says, so are we doing QA for your game YYR?
7102020	7104500	Well, ain't nothing in this world truly free.
7105060	7108740	I will tell you this.
7108740	7111380	This is actually an update to an already released game.
7111940	7114660	Although I did fix a number of issues in this version.
7114660	7119140	The only thing that has not been exhaustively tested is the leaderboard browser.
7119140	7124020	So I'm hoping that a few of you play it and that I will be able to, you know, take a look
7124020	7126180	and quickly patch things if they don't work.
7126180	7131540	But it should work because it was just based off of super multitaskings and super multitaskings
7131540	7132420	works.
7132420	7133780	So it should be fine.
7134740	7135220	All right.
7135220	7136020	That's but yeah.
7136020	7136260	Yeah.
7136260	7141380	That's that's still you never know people's weird PC configurations and stuff.
7141380	7143460	You never know what feedback you might get in the next couple of days.
7143460	7145060	And that's valuable feedback to have.
7146100	7146660	Yeah.
7146660	7148020	And I'd appreciate it.
7148020	7153140	So yeah, be sure to do the thumbs up the ratings, do the things that will get a notice because
7153140	7154740	yeah, we want YYR to succeed.
7154740	7157940	So yeah, you're already a success YYR.
7157940	7158260	All right.
7159140	7163220	We do have to let you go, though, so we can wrap up our show and let Bobby do a stream
7163220	7163700	of the game.
7163700	7166020	So but thank you so much again.
7166020	7169460	And I know we'll have you back on the show soon when you're ready to announce whatever
7169460	7173620	your next project is coming to steam or wherever it is you go and someday in television.
7174500	7175300	All right.
7175300	7175700	All right.
7175700	7176660	I'll be here.
7176660	7176980	All right.
7176980	7177700	Take care, my friend.
7178500	7178820	All right.
7178820	7182900	Have a great week and I'll start sending out those codes momentarily.
7182900	7183220	All right.
7183220	7183940	Sounds good.
7183940	7184660	Thank you so much.
7184660	7184980	Bye.
7184980	7185460	Take care.
7185460	7185780	All right.
7185780	7186740	Take care, guys.
7186740	7188020	Bye bye bye.
7188020	7188820	That is awesome.
7190100	7192020	Just so you know, I did not know he was going to do that.
7192500	7195220	I kind of knew that he was going to tell it.
7195220	7197940	I knew we were kind of getting the exclusive on a new steam thing like that.
7197940	7199940	I knew I did not know he was going to do that.
7199940	7201300	So that is really, really cool.
7201300	7202180	Why we are to do that.
7202180	7203220	So awesome.
7203220	7203700	Awesome.
7203700	7203940	Yeah.
7203940	7205460	I'm going to be playing that as well.
7205460	7205960	All right.
7206820	7208180	Anyhow, I know.
7208980	7210980	Do you want to hear the cruel irony in this whole thing?
7210980	7212100	That's really funny.
7212100	7215060	So I guess Ragenator like forgot the shows on the night or something because he's doing
7215060	7216420	his own Twitch stream, which is fine.
7216420	7217780	You know, there's only so many days in the week.
7217780	7219620	You got to do what you got to do when I don't care.
7220420	7223780	But the one night someone's here giving away a free game on Steam.
7223780	7224420	He's not here.
7227780	7228340	Poor guy.
7229540	7230820	I can give them a copy.
7230820	7231140	All right.
7232180	7233300	He can send the email.
7234260	7235700	Everybody knows that dude's name.
7235700	7237380	Yyr will recognize him in a heartbeat.
7237380	7240500	I just I would want somebody to be like, oh, email this guy.
7240500	7241300	He'll give you a free.
7241300	7244580	Like, I want to make sure that the people who redeem the code are actually people.
7244580	7245460	Listen, all are.
7245460	7249140	So make sure just try to keep it amongst friends, y'all.
7249220	7249540	All right.
7250420	7252260	Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news.
7252260	7254580	I don't know how we top free game announcement.
7254580	7257380	Do you do do you get free games listening to other podcasts?
7258020	7258820	Not that I'm here to.
7258820	7260180	I love I love all podcasts.
7260180	7260820	You guys know that.
7260820	7265700	But I'm going to I'm going to take the little the little promotion opportunities.
7265700	7271540	We listen to a lot of podcasting where I used to listen to the dev log a lot that, you know,
7271540	7273620	unity programming podcasts.
7273620	7275300	But I haven't listened to that in a while.
7275860	7276900	I need to catch up on that.
7276900	7281300	But Bobby and chat with the Debbie Downer comment.
7281300	7284260	Actually, a lot of podcasts give out free codes to every listener.
7284260	7285620	Bobby, to every listener.
7285620	7286660	I don't know about that.
7286660	7287460	I don't know about that.
7287460	7288180	All right.
7288180	7289060	Maybe they do.
7289060	7289380	I don't know.
7289380	7290340	I thought I thought.
7290340	7291780	But it's not for this game.
7294740	7295700	I'll take what I can get.
7295700	7296660	Sorry, Loki.
7296660	7296900	Yeah.
7297780	7298340	All right.
7298340	7299780	Let's get into some rapid fire news.
7299780	7301780	There is plenty of other stuff going on in the game industry.
7301780	7303060	We'll do some rapid fire news.
7303060	7303700	Loki.
7303700	7304420	All right.
7304420	7310580	So let's talk a little bit about how Super Mario Odyssey is getting some new costumes.
7310580	7310980	Yay.
7310980	7313300	I haven't played Super Mario Odyssey in a while.
7313300	7316340	I really should go back and do that because I still haven't gotten all of.
7318820	7320180	All of the collectibles in that.
7320900	7327380	But if you're continuing to play the game, you'll be able to get a Santa outfit or they
7327380	7333300	also have the 8-bit Mario kind of looks like the 8-bit Mario amiibo that they had.
7333300	7338580	So you'll be able to check out that kind of voxel Mario look.
7339140	7343140	And that's going to be coming soon, I believe, in an update.
7343140	7346500	I imagine it'll probably look like the 8-bit amiibo does kind of in that.
7346500	7347380	That's exactly what I said.
7347380	7347620	OK.
7347620	7348260	Oh, sorry.
7349300	7349540	OK.
7349540	7351540	So yeah, check it out.
7352260	7360740	And then there's an expansion coming to Civ 6, which is going to be February 14th called
7360740	7361940	the Gathering Storm.
7362660	7368980	And apparently it's the second expansion for the game and they're adding, I guess, global
7368980	7372100	warming or different like weather in the game.
7372100	7377540	So they have like apparently how you use natural resources.
7378980	7384020	It's going to affect the weather, natural disasters and global warming.
7385380	7390580	So you get the balance between, you know, progress and destroying the planet.
7390580	7392340	I've been slacking on Civilization 6.
7392340	7396820	I need to play more, but I kind of love that they're incorporating this into the game,
7396820	7401060	even though it's almost like it kind of reminds me with like flooding was a natural disaster
7401060	7402180	in the original SimCity.
7402180	7407380	It's kind of like they've taken that to the next step, which is sadly rooted in reality
7407380	7407700	a little bit.
7408260	7414660	Aside from the climate stuff, they also have expanded technology, civic trees into a future
7414660	7418340	era and adds nine new leaders across eight new civilizations.
7418340	7418820	Oh, wow.
7419380	7422100	So is there any civilization you can't be at this point?
7422100	7423060	It's pretty crazy.
7423060	7423560	Epics.
7425780	7427140	Yeah, like in winter games.
7427140	7429460	And this came out on the Commodore 64.
7429460	7431060	I don't know if you ever played those Olympic games.
7431060	7433060	No, I remember the like California games.
7433060	7435220	Yeah, you could pick what country you were from.
7435220	7437220	And one of the countries you could pick was Epics.
7437220	7439460	Epics, the studio that made the game.
7439460	7443700	So that's the one civilization that's not represented in Civ at this point is Epics.
7443700	7450580	Anyway, that's at the forefront of my mind because just recently Bobby was doing one
7450580	7452900	of his streams of the Commodore 64 mini.
7452900	7456500	And so he was playing because like all of those games, because I didn't really realize
7456500	7459300	this, but they were releasing one of those games like every year.
7459300	7460420	They did summer games.
7460420	7461300	They did winter games.
7461300	7462260	They did summer games too.
7462260	7463460	They did California games.
7463460	7464580	They did world games.
7464580	7466180	I forgot that even existed.
7466180	7466980	Like they were cranking out those games.
7466980	7469700	Yeah, I used to play a ton of California games.
7469700	7474660	That was on, um, I think the NES or Super NES was when I was playing that.
7474660	7476260	But then I had that on the Lynx too.
7476260	7482020	That was my go-to game on the Lynx because the Lynx had, um, it was BMX.
7482020	7484820	There was surfing, hacky sack.
7484820	7487140	And I don't remember the last one.
7487140	7488100	That was California games.
7488100	7488420	Yeah.
7488420	7490100	Uh, frisbee maybe.
7490100	7490420	I don't know.
7490420	7490580	Yeah.
7490580	7492100	And it's impossible to catch a frisbee.
7492100	7494020	That is all on the Commodore 64 mini.
7494020	7497860	All those games games are the games games.
7497860	7498340	I don't know.
7498340	7499380	I don't know what else you call that.
7499380	7500740	California is hacky sack.
7500740	7501700	That's aged well.
7501700	7501940	Yeah.
7501940	7502180	Yeah.
7502180	7502500	I know.
7502500	7502820	Right.
7502820	7504500	Well, the world games was pretty cool too.
7504500	7505620	So this is the other head on.
7505620	7508100	The BMX one is fun because it's going downhill.
7508100	7512020	So it was just like, okay, I'm going to Yolo this right now and see what happens,
7512020	7512420	you know?
7512420	7512580	Yeah.
7512580	7515540	And it's, it's interesting as Bobby Blackwell points out, because it's almost
7515540	7519780	like a little time capsule of society in the eighties, because you can be from the
7519780	7524500	USSR, you can be from West Germany and like, you know, because these games were
7524500	7527540	from 1984, 1985 when the world was different.
7527780	7528180	Yes.
7528180	7529060	Kind of neat.
7529060	7529540	Anyway.
7529540	7529780	Sorry.
7529780	7530900	I didn't mean to digress too much.
7530900	7531620	Czechoslovakia.
7532980	7537860	Didn't mean to make a civilization six discussion about California games, but
7537860	7538660	here we are.
7540420	7541300	I did it.
7541300	7542020	Anyway.
7542020	7546180	Let's talk about Netflix and shows that are doing very well on Netflix.
7546180	7548900	The Castlevania series apparently doing very well.
7548900	7551540	I've been watching it, thought about it the other day, but then my wife's like,
7551540	7554900	no, I need to, I need to, I just haven't got around to it.
7554900	7556340	I keep getting sucked into MMOs.
7556340	7560420	But anyway, executive producer, Adisha and car, uh, has mentioned about the
7560420	7561780	Netflix Castlevania series.
7561780	7564100	Uh, it really over performed.
7564100	7565140	It did crazy.
7565140	7568100	Well, we immediately got greenlit for season three.
7568100	7570340	I wouldn't have a job if it wasn't for the fans.
7570340	7571700	So congrats on the success.
7571700	7573540	I hear a lot of great things about the anime.
7573540	7575380	I will sit down and watch it at some point.
7575380	7578260	You know, I'm going to watch that ingress anime when it finally comes to Netflix.
7578260	7579620	Cause it's, oh, is that coming to Netflix?
7579620	7581460	It's airing in Japan right now.
7581460	7582980	So it's doing like the weekly thing in Japan.
7582980	7586260	And then I think like this month or sometime really soon,
7586260	7589300	once all the episodes have aired, then they're going to release it on Netflix.
7589300	7591940	Am I still going to understand what ingress is about after watching it?
7591940	7594100	Cause I fucking don't know what ingress is about.
7594100	7594980	I just play the game.
7594980	7596820	Like, I don't know the fucking lore is.
7596820	7599300	I know this makes any goddamn sense.
7599300	7602740	It's kind of like, like world of Warcraft has this really deep lore that, you know,
7602740	7604660	what it means to be horrid and what it means to be Alliance.
7604660	7606100	And ingress is kind of the same thing with it.
7606100	7611220	Like I keep seeing these like ingress prime advertisements on YouTube and stuff like that.
7611220	7613940	And they're like, I'm like, I don't fucking know what's going on.
7613940	7617140	We're seeing, we're seeing some new players, uh, pop up in the game.
7617140	7619700	So it's kinda, it's kinda refreshing to have that game kind of
7619700	7623140	a little, get a little kick in the ass and get invigorated all the free time for that.
7623140	7624980	And it's just time, time, time, time.
7624980	7625460	You know what though?
7625460	7628420	I found it to be a good, like, because I have been,
7628420	7630580	there's been the double XP thing that's been going on.
7630580	7633380	I don't know if I talked about this in my gaming week, probably just,
7633380	7635460	I've been trying to focus on the mobile games less.
7635460	7638180	Cause I know they're kind of like my ongoing, I do them every week,
7638180	7641220	but I, because double XP is going on in ingress right now,
7641220	7644340	like I have been out there trying to do like a lot of micro fielding.
7644340	7648260	I was over at one of the cemeteries today, just walking, walking, walking.
7648260	7652100	And I was, you know, walking for a good, probably hour out there.
7652100	7655220	Now granted it's walk, stop, walk, stop, but sometimes it's like,
7655220	7658260	Oh, I got to walk from this corner of the cemetery all the way back over there.
7658260	7659380	Cause I have that key over there.
7659380	7661300	So, you know, it's, it's decent exercise.
7661300	7664340	It's better than sitting at home playing California games, hacky sack.
7664340	7664580	Yeah.
7664580	7666100	So there's that.
7666340	7670260	Anyway, uh, Castlevania is doing very well and looks like it will have a, uh,
7670260	7672340	another version that's coming out there.
7672340	7674660	Um, Loki, you may have to help me on this one.
7674660	7676100	Cause for some reason, the story is not loading,
7676100	7679540	but I don't know if there's much more to say on this other than that dead or alive,
7679540	7684900	extreme three scarlet is coming out for the PlayStation four and the switch.
7684900	7686980	That's an odd game for the switch, but okay.
7686980	7687540	Whatever.
7687540	7691940	So those of you that are fans of dead or alive extreme, which is, if I remember right,
7691940	7695780	the volleyball and the titties and all the anime titties,
7696660	7697860	it's actually, it's two different ones.
7697860	7703700	So they have the scarlet for PlayStation four and on the switch is dead or life festival 2018.
7703700	7704500	Oh, excuse me.
7704500	7706420	So it's going to be a different game.
7706420	7711860	I guess that one, they're going to launch, um, March 20th, 2019 in Japan.
7713220	7722820	And it says, um, Misaka or Misaki who appears in the DMM games, uh, is going to be in dead
7722820	7725860	or live extreme Venus vacation for PC.
7725860	7727380	So there's a PC game coming too.
7728100	7732260	Uh, and apparently pre-orders are open and they have an official website open.
7732260	7736420	So I have no idea why all this is, but I guess we'll find out.
7737060	7739940	Uh, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
7739940	7742900	Luckily the chat room is really into the games discussion here.
7742900	7746580	Vid power says, I like how hacky sack in California games is called foot bag.
7747140	7747540	That's right.
7747540	7748260	It was called foot bag.
7748260	7751700	And I think it's one of those things kind of like how Kleenex is really tissue,
7751700	7752660	but everybody calls it Kleenex.
7752660	7753060	You know what I mean?
7753060	7754500	I think hacky sack is a brand.
7754500	7756020	So I think that's why they couldn't call it that.
7756020	7759300	Um, uh, like Xerox is a copy and all that.
7759300	7763220	And, uh, if you're, I remember there was some famous court case where like,
7763220	7768260	if your name gets associated with it so much, you end up kind of like losing your,
7768260	7770020	I guess, trademark in some ways or whatever.
7770020	7773700	And I think it was Xerox or somebody that lost one of the,
7773700	7777940	it was one of those big ones that everybody kind of associates, you know, uh, with that.
7777940	7781300	So, but I think that's, what's what the deal is with hacky sack in that case.
7781380	7785380	So anyhow, um, all right, let's move on.
7785380	7788340	Uh, we're gonna talk about what is coming out in stores this week.
7788340	7790980	Uh, obviously it's going to be dying down a little bit.
7790980	7793620	Although I don't know what smashes next week.
7795620	7798020	So there, there's still stuff, you know, coming out this week.
7798020	7802580	So we've got, um, you know, slowing down a little bit, not a whole ton.
7802580	7806820	I mean like, okay, so like Darksiders three, that's a pretty decent release.
7806820	7809220	That's on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
7809220	7813140	We have spin tires, mud runner, American wilds edition on the switch.
7813140	7815140	Oh yeah. I'm sure we all have that pre-ordered.
7815140	7816740	That's apparently a pretty good racing game.
7817300	7819940	It's not so much racing. It's like an off-roading game.
7819940	7824980	Um, I'll stop talking shit artifact, which is on PC, Mac and Linux.
7824980	7829620	Um, Katsuie, Daphne, uh, Kizuna,
7830660	7833780	Jigoku, Tachi on PlayStation four.
7833780	7834580	It's a shoot them up.
7835460	7841540	We have, um, Parkitect on PC, Mac and Linux, uh, persona Q2,
7841540	7846340	new cinema labyrinth on 3DS arc survival evolved on the switch.
7847060	7850900	And let's see fighting ex layer on PC.
7850900	7851400	And that's it.
7852100	7852340	Nice.
7852980	7853220	All right.
7853220	7856100	Traveling over to Japan, a few releases in Japan this week,
7856100	7858420	obviously the calendar runs a little different over there.
7858420	7860820	So we do have a few releases on the PlayStation four this week,
7860820	7866100	including Katsuie Death Tiny, Kizuna, Jiko, Tachi comes out this week.
7866100	7869700	Uh, Steel Rats, Million Arthur, Arcana Blood,
7869700	7874100	and then Game Tengoku Cruise and Mix Special comes out in a regular
7874100	7877540	and a limited edition called a Gokuraku Box,
7877540	7879700	uh, comes out on the PlayStation four this week.
7879700	7884580	Um, on the switch this week, a game called Lapis Re Abyss comes out this week,
7884580	7888900	as well as Common Rider Climax Scramble ZO in a, uh,
7888980	7892980	premium limited edition comes out, uh, this week in Japan as well.
7892980	7898020	A game called Billion Road and Super Bomberman R gets a price reduction on the switch.
7898020	7899460	If you still haven't checked that out.
7899460	7903620	Also, I'm sure a lot of people, uh, wanting to check out Overcooked 2.
7903620	7906660	If you're in Japan, you get your release of that game, which, um,
7906660	7909220	I I've watched my buddy JD play those games a little bit,
7909220	7911860	but I haven't really played them a lot myself, but I hear they're an awful lot of fun.
7911860	7913620	So I probably need to spend more time with it.
7913620	7914660	Hey, guess what?
7914660	7917380	The Vita, the plug has not been pulled on the Vita yet.
7917380	7919460	One release on the Vita in Japan this week.

7926260	7928420	Uh, heading over to the UK, if you wouldn't mind, Loki.
7928420	7928740	All right.
7928740	7932820	Dark Stars three is going to be coming out on PlayStation four and Xbox one.

7970100	7970600	And that's it.
7971220	7971620	All right.
7971620	7974580	Let's get to the email because you guys send us emails and we love to read them.
7977380	7981380	Also, I'll never get sick of this song.
7982420	7982900	Still happy.
7982900	7985780	We're still going to, we might change some of the music when we move over to Twitch,
7985780	7988100	but I don't think I could ever get rid of journey to the Wonderland.
7988100	7989060	I love this song too much.
7989060	7989460	Yeah.
7989460	7989780	All right.
7990500	7993300	Anyway, uh, let's, uh, get to an email this week.
7993300	7997460	The first one is from YYR who was just on this program for several minutes, but you
7997460	7999220	know what to monopolize all the segments.
7999220	7999700	You know what though?
7999700	8002020	If you're going to give a game away for free on the show, I'm going to let you have
8002020	8002660	all the time you want.
8002660	8003380	So here you go.
8003380	8005620	Actually, and there's some good, uh, there's some good thoughts and points in this
8005620	8006740	email, so let's get to it.
8006740	8008580	YYR send us an email.
8008580	8009540	It says, hello, LR.
8009540	8011460	Just a few thoughts on last week's episode.
8011460	8012740	Rob, your suspicion was correct.
8012740	8016500	The version of Tetris on NES that was created and published by Nintendo themselves was
8016500	8021460	strictly a single player affair and had no multiplayer of any kind.
8021460	8026580	Uh, it was also hot garbage compared to the far superior Tenken version, which is still
8026580	8030820	to date the only console version of Tetris that has a co-op mode where two players position
8030820	8033300	pieces in the same well at the same time.
8033300	8034020	It's awesome.
8034020	8037140	And everyone should try it out as at least once.
8037140	8040660	You know what the NES version had, I swear to God, do you know what the NES version had
8040660	8045780	that made it like that, that part of the reason why people remember it more so it's on
8045780	8046660	the music.
8046660	8048420	It's the music in the NES version.
8048420	8055060	I'm telling you, you it's that, that song is still in this Tetris effect, 1989 skin.
8055060	8056500	All it says is crazy.
8056500	8061060	Anyway, not that I'm slamming Tengen Tetris because obviously I remember that that
8061060	8061700	version.
8061700	8062900	That's what I had thought last week.
8063780	8067540	I thought people really desired that version of the game because it had something special
8067540	8069300	that they took out of the Nintendo one.
8069300	8070340	I thought it was multiplayer.
8070340	8072580	And as it turns out, I was right.
8073780	8078100	All right, on the subject of Microsoft and whether they should care about Japan, quite
8078100	8079460	honestly, I don't think they should bother.
8080180	8084900	They put in a lot of effort back in the 360 days, recruiting Japanese developers, producing
8084900	8087460	exclusive JRPGs, and what did it get them?
8087460	8092420	By the end of the generation, they still had only sold about 1.6 million 360s in Japan
8092500	8095140	versus 10 million PlayStation threes.
8095140	8100260	Worse yet, none of the momentum they had built carried over to the Xbox one, which is floundering
8100260	8102740	there somewhere around the a hundred K mark.
8102740	8105140	Yeah, but I think Microsoft like gave up.
8105140	8109300	Like, I think honestly, a lot of those sales are like, you know how like people here will
8109300	8111140	import stuff from Japan, like really?
8111140	8115700	I think there are people players in Japan that will import stuff from America that they
8115700	8116980	don't necessarily always get.
8116980	8119540	Like a lot of the Western stuff that's developed over here.
8119540	8119940	Possibly.
8119940	8120420	Yeah.
8120500	8122340	Things like Fortnite weren't developed in Japan.
8122340	8124580	And there's probably people over there that want to play that type of stuff.
8124580	8127700	I mean, that's a bad example because I'm sure there's a localized.
8129540	8131380	I know what a World of Warcraft was.
8131380	8132900	A big example that always has come up.
8132900	8134580	They don't have World of Warcraft in Japan.
8134580	8138820	That's that's another reason why Final Fantasy 14 has been able to succeed in many ways.
8138820	8139700	It's not as big as WoW.
8139700	8144260	I'm not trying to say that, but in Japan, it's bigger because WoW doesn't exist.
8144260	8145460	So anyway, that's an example.
8147540	8148500	Let's see, where was I?
8149220	8155140	Oh, not to mention, console hardware sales in Japan have decreased literally every year
8155140	8160740	since 2006, only increasing in 2017, mostly due to the launch of the Switch.
8160740	8164420	I just feel like getting Japan to care about an Xbox console will be way too expensive
8164420	8166260	and to justify the potential reward.
8166260	8169540	Xbox remains popular in America and to a lesser extent, Europe.
8169540	8173540	If game developers want to sell to this audience, regardless of where they're located, they
8173540	8175940	can consider Xbox development and leave it at that.
8175940	8178340	And for me, maybe that's what it comes down to.
8178340	8181620	It's not even so much the fans as much as it is the developer.
8181620	8185700	And granted, maybe my perspective is a little bit skewed because I tend to gravitate more
8185700	8187700	towards the Japanese RPGs.
8187700	8191300	Hell, this show was founded around a Japanese-based music game.
8191300	8194100	So I think I just tend to gravitate towards those games.
8194100	8198500	But even in the 16 years we've been doing Orange Launch Radio, I think we've seen a,
8198500	8200660	you know, very like Japan market.
8200660	8202260	Oh, well, our market.
8202820	8204900	Well, that's a unique market to US market.
8204900	8208260	Europe market has become more and more and more of a worldwide market.
8208260	8211540	Hence why we don't have regions on the Switch anymore.
8211540	8213380	And, you know, it's more becoming a thing.
8213380	8214980	You just you don't have any systems.
8214980	8215480	You know what I mean?
8216660	8223540	Anyway, lastly, Loki mused about why Cruise and Blast hadn't come out on Switch.
8223540	8225060	I think the reason is simple.
8225060	8230420	It was developed by Raw Thrills, a company that exclusively develops arcade games.
8230420	8232180	They don't do any work on consoles.
8232180	8236420	So unless Nintendo contracts another developer to do the port, I don't think we'll ever see one.
8237060	8239780	Thanks, as always, for the show and have a great week.
8239780	8241380	Have fun YYR.
8241380	8244100	Or any Cruise and Game because it's still Nintendo property.
8244100	8248180	I mean, yeah, but those Raw Thrills, they do a lot of those arcade experiences.
8248180	8250020	I feel like everything you see in arcade.
8250020	8251300	That's exactly what I was gonna say.
8251300	8252580	All the games are out there.
8252580	8253700	It's like Raw Thrills.
8253700	8254420	I mean, even they do.
8254420	8257780	Hey, props to him for keeping it alive, honestly.
8257860	8260900	Yeah, they're usually a big draw for a lot of the stuff there.
8261540	8265300	Speaking of things that are alive and things that are not going to be alive much longer.
8265300	8269060	Another thing that YYR brought up in chat earlier, Guitar Hero TV,
8269060	8272260	that whole Guitar Hero online mode, that's gone December 1st.
8272820	8275700	So, yeah, it's kind of shrugged my shoulders.
8275700	8278420	It was like $5 at Target the other day.
8278420	8283540	It's unfortunate that the music game Renaissance, like coming,
8283540	8287620	like the Renaissance to the Renaissance, when Rock Band 4 and this new Guitar Hero,
8288100	8290180	it's kind of sad that that kind of all hit with a whimper.
8290740	8294980	It's not because of, I mean, it's, I understand it's a lot of is because it's
8294980	8299300	expensive to license music and stuff, and so they have to monetize it and everything.
8299300	8303620	But at the same time, I also feel like that it's Activision and they want to
8303620	8305860	fucking monetize that into the fucking ground.
8305860	8311300	So, you know, I don't feel entirely as bad.
8311300	8316420	I just wish it was more of like, hey, we have original music a la like DJ Hero, you know?
8318180	8318580	I don't know.
8318580	8325300	Maybe those games need more original tracks in them and relied less on licensed stuff.
8325300	8326580	Although license does sell.
8327220	8329620	Act F points out Rock Band is still going as far as I know.
8329620	8334420	But it's not, it's, it's, it's not dominating the conversation like it used to.
8334420	8336340	You know, Rock Band 2 is the new thing.
8336340	8336900	You know what I mean?
8336900	8340580	It's kind of, it's, it's fallen back into the niche thing, which is, which is fine.
8340580	8341140	But anyway.
8341940	8342340	All right.
8342980	8343540	Let's move on.
8343540	8344260	More emails.
8344260	8346420	Robert M emails us and says, welcome back.
8346500	8348100	You seem to pick a heck of a week off.
8348820	8350020	Not that it could have been planned.
8350020	8350500	Yeah, it is.
8350500	8354180	I've been saying for like, ever since I bought those tickets to the Fan Fest, I'm like, we're
8354180	8355060	not going to be here that week.
8355780	8357060	Weird question.
8357060	8362340	With Incineroar in Smash Brothers Ultimate and Desuadeye in Pokken Tournament, do you
8362340	8364580	think we'll see pre-Marinera?
8364580	8368500	I always want to say pre-Marinera, but that's not what I was going to say.
8368500	8369540	It's pre-Marina.
8370180	8371220	Cause like a ocean.
8371220	8372660	I always want to say pre-Marinera.
8373620	8376500	Do you think we'll say pre-Marina and in what?
8379700	8385300	It's honestly is my least favorite of the three starters, but I know pre-Marina has
8385300	8385700	fans.
8386340	8387140	So I don't know.
8388820	8390740	Maybe in a Let's Go game in the future.
8390740	8391380	I'll go with that.
8391380	8393060	I'm going to go without the safe answer.
8393060	8396820	Since you have the option to give you, gift you stuff via internet.
8396820	8401300	So yeah, I don't know, but I get, well, the point Robert M is getting at is that you've
8401300	8402740	got one fighting game over here.
8402740	8404100	You got Pokken with Desuadeye.
8404100	8406820	You got one fighting game over here with Incineroar, Smash Brothers.
8406820	8409780	So where's the fighting game that pre-Marina is going to go in?
8409780	8410660	You know what?
8410660	8411780	They'll get an RPG.
8413140	8415300	I guess, I guess Pokemon's an RPG.
8415300	8417700	We don't know what the DLC is going to be yet.
8417700	8418340	Yeah.
8418340	8418740	You know what?
8418740	8422660	Maybe, maybe in the future, you know, wait like 14 years from now and we'll get like
8422660	8426900	Pokemon Let's Go pre-Marinera for your pasta.
8426900	8427140	All right.
8427140	8433700	Anyway, pre-Marinera noodles, pre-Marinera and noodles, just dry noodles and tangela.
8433700	8434180	That's it.
8434180	8440900	Pre it's, it's a match made in heaven pre-Marinera and tangela and tangela pops out of a box.
8440900	8442500	I'm back, back, back again.
8442500	8442820	All right.
8442820	8450020	Anyway, um, also, do you think there will be representation of the sun and moon era in
8450020	8451460	detective Pikachu?
8451460	8453940	We never did get a chance to really talk about that trailer.
8453940	8455140	The detective Pikachu trailer.
8455140	8455700	Awesome.
8455700	8459620	It was, I was, it was one of those things that I was kind of like, that's not what I
8459620	8463300	expected at all, but I don't hate it.
8464020	8468100	I was like, I kind of like the whole like Pokemon are real.
8468100	8470100	You guys know they're real.
8470980	8472180	Like they look real.
8473140	8475060	They look furry when they shouldn't look furry.
8475060	8476260	It's it's animals.
8476260	8477700	They're supposed to be furry.
8477700	8478580	I know, I know.
8479460	8480180	They look weird.
8480980	8483540	Anyway, um, let's see.
8483540	8487540	And, uh, do you think there'll be representation, representation of that in detective Pikachu?
8487540	8488420	I think so.
8488420	8492660	I think even if it's just a little throw away, you know, the sun and moon still are the current
8492660	8493300	games.
8493300	8497140	And I don't think, I think gen eight will be a holiday release at this point.
8497140	8501060	I think let's go seems to be doing well enough that it's kind of like Nintendo can kind of
8501060	8503940	rest on that for an entire year till we get to next holiday.
8503940	8509460	They're going to do like, let's go something that's going to be, I don't know, cross between
8509460	8514740	the two, like no gen two, let's go Sentret and a Spinarak.
8514740	8515460	I don't know.
8515460	8519460	I'm just saying like, you know, cause they had, um, you know, they always do like, you
8519460	8521860	know, red and blue and then, Oh, Hey, yellow.
8521860	8525380	And it's like the two combined together or is that, well, let's go.
8525380	8528580	Pikachu kind of is flat out a remake of yellow.
8529140	8533300	And then all they did with let's go Eevee is they just kind of substituted Pikachu.
8533300	8536900	Well, my understanding is, is, but it's not, it's not that you're playing this radically
8536900	8537460	different game.
8537540	8539380	It's just that you've got Eevee instead of Pikachu.
8539380	8543220	And some of the ones you run across are different, but they're not like fundamentally different
8543220	8544340	plots or anything like that.
8545300	8547700	And were the other games fundamentally different?
8547700	8550100	I just want to be clear before somebody calls me out on it.
8550100	8555540	Let's go is also not really a directory make of yellow because the character of blue and
8555540	8557220	I think red are in it.
8557220	8561620	So it's kind of like you're going through the footsteps of what these characters went
8561620	8562820	through 20 years ago.
8562820	8565540	And plus it does have things like Alolan Pokemon.
8565540	8567380	And I think I heard mega forms are in it too.
8567380	8567860	Yes.
8567860	8570020	Mega evolution, which didn't exist in gen one.
8570020	8575380	So it's, it's very much like a remix, but it's most rooted in Pokemon.
8575380	8580340	You get like the X and Y megas for like Mewtwo as well, which I'm assuming that's from X
8580340	8580900	and Y.
8580900	8582660	So that whole thing started.
8582660	8582900	Yeah.
8582900	8584180	X and Y was where that started.
8584180	8585460	So six gen six.
8585460	8585780	Yeah.
8585780	8587620	So there's, it's all sorts of weird.
8587620	8589620	And then Miltan, which is technically gen eight.
8589620	8591220	So, you know, you have that in there too.
8591220	8591700	Yeah.
8591700	8599140	So, Oh, act deft also points out Eevee was the rival Pokemon in yellow because in the
8599140	8603700	other games you had to pick Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, and your rival would always pick
8603700	8605220	whatever was strong.
8605220	8610340	Cause you know, Charmander beats a Bulbasaur beats Squirtle beats Charmander.
8610340	8613380	So your rival would always pick whatever was strong.
8613380	8617220	But since there isn't that in Pokemon yellow, your rival picks Eevee.
8618500	8620180	So yeah.
8620180	8624500	And I named my rival name because like, I was trying to think of something clever, but
8624500	8626820	it was late and I, I didn't think of anything clever.
8626820	8628580	So I just did a God of war meme.
8628580	8630100	So his name is boy.
8633860	8635300	My rival is Mr. Smoosh.
8635300	8636020	Mr. Smoosh.
8636020	8637460	Yeah, that's better than mine.
8637460	8638340	I did it on stream.
8638340	8641460	My kids, unprompted, did each other.
8641460	8642900	So, you know, that's funny.
8645060	8645700	That was kind of funny.
8645700	8648340	But your rival's not really like your rival.
8648580	8653620	Like, it's just like your little buddy that also wants to succeed and is always testing
8653620	8653860	you.
8653860	8658980	So anyway, here we, there, there we go back on our Pokemon bullshit, but that's, that's
8658980	8659620	because of the email.
8659620	8660340	I blame the email.
8662420	8665060	Speaking of movie trailers though, you know, I got to digress for a minute.
8665060	8669460	I got to ask about, cause y'all the Lion King, the Lion King.
8669460	8671380	What'd you think of that Lion King preview?
8671380	8672820	That looked hot to me.
8672820	8674180	Recycling their properties.
8674180	8675620	I don't give a shit.
8675620	8677300	Like it looks really good.
8677380	8679860	It looks so like, well, here's the thing, like, honestly.
8679860	8680100	Okay.
8680100	8685940	Have you ever seen the Broadway show where it's like people in puppets, but it looks
8685940	8687140	very classic.
8687140	8689780	I thought that's what the movie was going to be.
8689780	8694660	I thought the movie was going to be like people in puppet outfits, but it was done in a very
8694660	8697860	like, like I know it sounds ridiculous when I say it, but if you've seen the Broadway
8697860	8700740	show, it's very artistic and very well done.
8700740	8704660	Like spoiler alert for a Broadway show that's been out there forever.
8705540	8710820	When they start the Lion King, obviously it's the circle of life, you know, the big opening,
8710820	8711060	right?
8711060	8712500	Everybody fucking knows that song.
8712500	8715060	If you've ever seen the Lion King in your life, that's the big song.
8715060	8719860	So when you see it in the theater or in the, uh, in the Broadway theater, uh, or if it
8719860	8723300	travels around, whatever, like not only do people come out on stage, but then all of
8723300	8725060	a sudden people are coming down the aisles.
8725060	8728820	You have these big giraffes and elephant puppets that come down the aisles and they're all
8728820	8729220	around you.
8729220	8732420	And so it's like, everything is surrounding you and it's magnificent.
8732420	8734100	It's like, holy shit.
8734100	8736580	This is not like your normal type of play.
8736580	8741780	So I thought the movie was going to be like the puppetry type of stuff because I thought
8741780	8745300	when you hear live action, I didn't think it was just going to be, Oh, they're going
8745300	8748580	to make everybody look like beast in beauty and the beast.
8748580	8748820	Yeah.
8748820	8752820	It's just like, it's just like the live action Aladdin that they're doing the live action.
8752820	8754420	You know, now it's live action.
8754420	8756260	I'm wondering though, are they going to incorporate?
8756260	8761700	Cause wasn't, didn't they add like parts to the Broadway play that aren't in the, uh,
8761700	8765140	yeah, like they do like an extra, they do some extra songs because they did that with
8765140	8766420	beauty and the beast too.
8766420	8766580	Yeah.
8766580	8769060	But the interesting thing about the beauty and the beast remake is they didn't put in
8769060	8770660	songs from the play.
8770660	8772260	They just made up new songs.
8772260	8772900	I thought they did.
8772900	8774580	Oh, I thought it was the one from the play.
8774580	8775380	No, they didn't.
8775380	8780420	Uh, I know, like, I think there was a song in the movie called morning report that got
8780420	8782580	cut and that is in the play.
8782580	8783220	Right.
8783220	8785060	So maybe it'll be in this live action movie.
8785060	8788340	I don't think that's what I'm thinking because yeah, they did have a deleted song.
8788340	8789060	Yeah.
8789060	8793620	And in, um, in beauty and the beast, they deleted a song from the movie called human
8793620	8794260	again.
8794260	8794740	Yes.
8794740	8796420	Which they put in the play.
8796980	8798500	And I think that was in the movie though.
8798500	8799940	I don't think they did it in the remake.
8800580	8801780	I thought it was.
8801780	8803620	It was not in the, not in the cartoon.
8803620	8806500	Human again was not in the cartoon, but it was on like the Blu-ray.
8806500	8807220	Yeah.
8807220	8807940	Yeah.
8807940	8811380	So, but I think it was in the remake.
8811380	8811860	Was it?
8811860	8812660	I don't know.
8812660	8814580	I can't keep it all straight anymore.
8814580	8815220	Jesus.
8815220	8815620	All right.
8815620	8817860	Anyway, who knew you were getting a movie show?
8817860	8818820	All right, let's go.
8818820	8820580	But again, I blame the emailer.
8820580	8822420	This is what happens, but we love it.
8822420	8826260	But you see now that we've asked about detective Pikachu and now we're talking about detective
8826260	8826740	Pikachu.
8826740	8830740	So like regarding that, so detective Pikachu, you know, like it was something that when
8830740	8834580	I heard it was coming out, I was like, kind of, eh, I don't know if I want to see that,
8834580	8839300	but then now I do want to see that now makes me kind of curious.
8839300	8841300	Not necessarily like I'm jumping on board.
8841300	8844500	Oh, by the way, and this is kind of segwaying into what I'm talking about here.
8844500	8849860	So there was a cameo in Wreck-It Ralph 2, Sonic the Hedgehog explaining the Internet,
8849860	8853780	which I thought was funny because, you know, Sonic the Hedgehog is very prevalent on social
8853780	8855460	media and it's kind of funny like that.
8855460	8858740	But anyway, speaking of Sonic the Hedgehog, so I'm kind of curious now to see the Sonic
8858740	8864980	the Hedgehog live action trailer, which could be hot garbage, but Jim Carrey and I totally
8864980	8866740	will see it because it has Jim Carrey in it.
8866740	8867140	I know.
8867140	8868020	All right.
8868020	8872340	Which again, if people don't know where Loki comes from, it actually has nothing to do
8872340	8874820	with the Marvel character, Loki.
8874820	8876500	You got Loki from the mask, would you?
8876500	8877380	It was from the mask.
8877380	8877880	Yeah.
8878500	8880420	Yes, because I am a fan of Jim Carrey.
8880420	8880920	All right.
8881460	8882180	I need to see his show.
8882180	8885220	Yes, and I did see the Stan Lee cameo in Wreck-It Ralph 2 as well.
8885220	8885720	All right.
8886260	8887220	Anyhow, moving on.
8887220	8888660	One more email from Robert M.
8888660	8893060	I also see that for those who were understandably turned off by Animal Crossing Pocket Camp's
8893060	8897460	loot box, fortune cookies, they're adding a cabin you can arrange your collected furniture
8897460	8897860	in.
8897860	8900580	So after one year, you can finally have a house.
8901460	8904500	I don't know if you borrow bells from Dom Nook to expand it.
8904500	8908180	I'm not quite as excited as for the Switch version, but very interested to see how this
8908180	8909060	works out.
8909060	8913860	Like, Robert M., with all respect, and I think you're saying you're in the same boat here.
8913860	8918580	The minute they announced that Switch version, uninstalled Animal Crossing from my phone.
8918580	8919220	Who cares?
8919220	8919780	Who cares?
8919780	8920580	Sorry.
8920580	8921700	Good thing Jamie's not here.
8921700	8923940	She kicked my ass because I'm sure she's still playing it.
8923940	8926020	But who cares?
8926020	8927540	We have a Switch version on the way.
8927540	8930420	I got to prepare myself for that because it's going to be epic.
8931220	8931940	All right.
8931940	8932900	That's it for emails.
8932900	8933940	You should send us emails.
8933940	8936740	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8936740	8939940	But for now, we have some more stories before we get to the Skype line.
8940740	8943380	We'll try to, we're going to try to kind of run through these stories to make sure we
8943380	8944500	have plenty of time for Skype.
8945380	8946340	So let's get to it.
8946340	8946840	Loki.
8947780	8952660	I know I'm going to talk to you about shortages and you know which company I'm talking about
8952660	8956100	already when I say there's going to be a shortage of something.
8956100	8957540	It's obviously Nintendo.
8958100	8962820	And what did Nintendo not realize that they're going to have enough copies of?
8962820	8966580	Well of course it's going to be the brand new Piranha Plant amiibo.
8966580	8970580	It is sold out pretty much at every retailer in Japan.
8971140	8976820	And which I guess the figure doesn't even come out until February 15th of next year.
8976820	8983220	But they've already sold out of it and it's very hard to find apparently.
8983220	8985140	And one way you can possibly get it.
8985140	8989860	Well of course with all these deals online, Cyber Monday and whatnot.
8990420	8996100	December 7th there's going to be a limited box set of 63 amiibos.
8996100	9000820	All of the amiibos that I'm assuming that appear in the new Smash Brothers game.
9001620	9002900	And you can purchase that.
9003620	9006740	But there's only 50 of them and you can get that at Amazon Japan.
9006740	9008020	It comes with a box and a poster.
9009300	9010420	It's a little excessive.
9010420	9012100	I don't think I need that.
9012100	9016260	I'm surprised to hear Piranha Plant is like crazy popular as it is though.
9017540	9020820	When they first announced it I was like alright cool I guess.
9021540	9023460	There's other characters I would have put in the game.
9024100	9026660	Birdo, Wart, anything from Mario 2.
9026660	9028820	But Piranha Plant okay whatever go off.
9030260	9032580	I don't know I mean I guess we'll have to wait and see.
9032580	9034420	I think you know just give it more time.
9034420	9037780	I mean they're just I can't imagine they run too short of these amiibos.
9037780	9041860	It's not that it's just a damn plastic figure with an RFID.
9042740	9045380	Maybe because amiibos have been kind of slipping a little bit.
9045380	9047300	Maybe the underestimated demand.
9047300	9047860	You know what I mean?
9047860	9048740	They still got time.
9048740	9052340	I mean we're talking about a thing that comes out in February.
9052340	9054180	So I mean they have time to make more.
9054180	9054980	Get on it.
9054980	9055480	All right.
9056420	9061780	Rumors but we'll do it because it's coming from a reliable tech website called Throt.
9062420	9065940	And then via Eurogamer where we showed up on our radar.
9065940	9070660	But Microsoft is apparently going to be launching a diskless version of the Xbox One
9070660	9072180	in spring 2019.
9072180	9074820	I also bring this up because this topic has come up before.
9074820	9075620	Several times.
9075620	9079940	This is a little deja vu but it's only gaining more and more steam.
9079940	9082420	Which makes it look more and more true.
9082420	9083860	So get used to this idea.
9083860	9087220	I mean I'd have to see how much cheaper it would be but I don't know.
9087220	9089620	Yeah well we'll see.
9089620	9092660	Anyway the next gen Xbox is supposed to be in 2020.
9092660	9095300	So this is a little bit kind of like a bridge.
9095300	9097220	The code name for this device is Scarlet.
9097780	9101060	They're saying it's going to be sold substantially lower than it is now.
9101060	9104500	It could be as low as a hundred dollars cheaper.
9105380	9109620	Pushing it at I guess under two hundred dollars US dollars.
9110820	9115300	So I mean if they could get the price to a hundred dollars.
9115300	9117380	I know that's asking a lot but that would be insane.
9117380	9121860	Because like the Xbox One S was selling for 199 I think this week.
9122580	9124340	You know during Black Friday and stuff.
9124340	9130180	So you're thinking they need to get it down to like 149 to make it really.
9130180	9133140	So Black Friday has kind of screwed perceptions in that regard.
9133140	9137700	I mean I want to say yeah because yeah because they had yeah it was starting at 199.
9137700	9140100	And they had like a game bundle and stuff like that.
9140100	9144820	So it's just I don't want the S if I'm going to buy a system it's going to be yeah.
9144820	9149700	Because they have the Minecraft one terabyte Minecraft creators bundle is 199.
9149700	9154340	So they came with Minecraft and like some in-game currency and some other skins and stuff.
9156500	9160420	And then they had the Xbox One X for like 399.
9162180	9167780	Also Microsoft is apparently considering disk to digital which I feel like we've heard this one too.
9167780	9170420	Meaning you can trade in a physical game in return for a digital
9170420	9172420	download at certain participating retailers.
9172420	9176900	That's kind of a big deal if that's really the case.
9177700	9180100	That would be really the first of its kind to do that.
9180100	9180820	To trade it in.
9181380	9184500	And then I would assume that the company would be able to resell it.
9184500	9188020	But how would you stop it for just getting traded back in over and over?
9188020	9190340	Well I guess they don't give you as much money.
9190340	9192180	You probably have to still pay some type of money or something.
9192180	9193460	Probably some sort of redemption.
9194500	9197140	It would be like for the retailer where they'd have to
9197140	9199380	send it back to Microsoft to be destroyed or whatever.
9199380	9199700	Maybe.
9200260	9201380	I don't know it'll be interesting.
9201380	9207140	Um, rumors still swelling about the next console.
9207140	9209540	And whether it will have a disk drive or not.
9209540	9213940	The next gen of Xbox may go diskless which deja vu.
9213940	9216100	There was controversy at the beginning of Xbox One.
9216100	9216900	It should still have a drive.
9217860	9222580	People, speculation is that that's where Microsoft will ultimately fall.
9222580	9224900	Is that the next console will still have a drive.
9225540	9229540	But I don't think it would be as damning as it was this last time.
9229620	9232420	Because more and more people are going to why it's not necessary.
9232420	9236820	And I I'm on the fence like I purchased most of my stuff digitally.
9236820	9237860	And yeah I get it.
9237860	9244580	You know it's but then again I just got an Xbox or not an Xbox PlayStation 4 Pro.
9244580	9249140	And so a lot of the like I haven't really been downloading a lot of the 4k content.
9249140	9256900	So for me like I would think one of the draws I with the 4k um like a ultra HD Blu-ray drive
9256900	9262500	would be you know I would want to have those on disk versus downloading that stuff.
9262500	9266740	Because that's several you know gigabytes worth of data for movies.
9266740	9269540	And the hard drives that are in these you know like one terabyte.
9270580	9273300	It's all right for now but that's going to fill up really fast.
9273300	9278660	Especially when you have games like Fallout 76 with like oh hey it's a 4k textures.
9278660	9280820	Like yeah are like 90 gigabyte games.
9280820	9286100	So unless you like start plopping like 50 or like five terabyte drives in there.
9286740	9293860	And you know convince all the internet providers to not give me a you know download cap.
9293860	9296260	Then then yeah maybe that might work.
9296260	9302660	But I think until technology elsewhere catches up you're going to have to include a drive in there.
9302660	9306580	Like well it may be that you're skewing more towards digital downloads.
9306580	9307380	That's cool.
9307380	9309380	That's more money in your pocket honestly.
9309380	9314900	Because you're not having to sell you know physical copies of retailers and take a cut out of it.
9314900	9320340	But at the same time that's still going to be a part of it.
9320340	9322820	I mean and I'm I'm still going to buy physical games.
9322820	9325780	Especially if I find out like oh hey I've got to download like
9326740	9329780	100 gigabytes that's going to be on the disk or something like that.
9329780	9332100	And I don't I don't think anyone should like you know freak out.
9332100	9333620	Because again these are rumors.
9333620	9337380	But I think this is exactly the type of conversation Microsoft is trying to feel out.
9337380	9341780	Like is the gamer base ready to be diskless or do we still need to kind of have the disk.
9341780	9343780	And I think I think ultimately they will fall on the side.
9343780	9348260	I don't think it would be like I mean honestly like I don't watch a lot Ultra HD content
9349140	9351780	yet because I don't have anything that will play it.
9351780	9357940	I mean I could get digital copies for my PlayStation 4 but I just don't want to buy those.
9357940	9358440	Yeah.
9358980	9359780	So I don't know.
9359780	9361060	All right well let's move on.
9362340	9365220	Since Microsoft's got a clear shot next E3 we'll see.
9365780	9366280	Yeah.
9366580	9373300	So apparently there is UK commission that was looking at gambling in games.
9374340	9380100	So they're put out a report that talked about loot boxes.
9380100	9383620	And you know according to the commission says the gambling commissions
9383620	9388020	takes the view of the ability to convert in-game items to cash
9388580	9394180	or to trade them for other items of value means that they attain a real world value
9394180	9397220	and become articles of money or money's worth.
9397220	9403140	Whereas gambling facilitates or facilities are offered to British consumers
9403140	9408420	including with those with the use of in-game or in-game items
9408420	9413780	that can be converted in the cash or traded for items value a gambling license is required.
9413780	9418980	So they do see these loot boxes as you know gambling.
9418980	9422580	And even with that they said you know that they found that that 39 percent
9422580	9430020	of UK children 11 to 16 spend their or have spent their own money gambling.
9430020	9432500	14 percent had done so within the last week.
9433620	9443060	They said that the average amount spent during that time was 16 looks like 16 60 or 16 euro.
9443060	9449780	And then 60 percent of young people believe that their parents would wouldn't want them gambling.
9449780	9453220	19 percent claimed that they guardians had strict rules against gambling.
9453860	9458180	So they're actually talking about like actually gambling gambling not necessarily
9458180	9460420	that they purchase loot boxes or something like that.
9460420	9464820	But they see that because of this being more prevalent in games.
9464820	9469060	There's a correlation with gambling going up you know.
9471940	9476100	So it's it's interesting to see that and I think with other companies like you know
9476980	9482500	Belgium whatever blocking some of these we interest to see how it goes.
9482500	9486500	And I know that like some of these companies like EA have said well we're just not comply
9486500	9492020	with the laws you know you block it we're just not going to do it which makes you think you know like
9493460	9497460	wow they're really they're willing to break the law to sell this stuff.
9498020	9502340	I mean that's a lot because they're still convinced in their mind that it's not
9502340	9504100	what these companies are saying it is.
9504100	9506260	They're going to have to get dragged to court to stop doing.
9506260	9508100	Yeah it's just like ultimately they'll just stop releasing.
9508100	9511060	It's just like cigarette companies saying that cigarettes weren't addictive.
9511060	9512660	I mean come on it's the same thing.
9512660	9513860	They know what they're doing.
9513860	9515700	So it's just I don't know.
9516820	9517620	All right.
9517620	9522340	Well while we wait to see what shapes up with that legally moving on to a lot of talk about
9522340	9526660	accessibility in the gaming industry this week as there's been several different reports kind
9526660	9532020	of concerning accessibility with some recent titles including the Spyro Reignited trilogy.
9532580	9541700	Apparently it does lack subtitles in the Spyro Reignited trilogy and there are no subtitles.
9541700	9546340	So you know people that you need to rely on subtitles are a little bit irritated about this.
9546340	9547380	I'd like to use subtitles.
9547380	9549620	At least that's something that they could probably patch in.
9549620	9550900	So that's not such a big deal.
9550900	9554020	Yeah but it is also one of the things they shouldn't have to patch.
9554020	9555460	It shouldn't have done it out the gate right.
9555460	9559380	But yeah I even like I don't consider myself
9560100	9563220	disabled when it comes to like needing the subtitles.
9563220	9567780	But like I'm definitely like because I get really distracted by like background noise.
9567780	9570820	Like if I'm in a restaurant or something I have to really focus on
9570820	9572660	who's talking to me and what they're saying.
9572660	9576020	Because a lot of times I will get so easily distracted by noise around me.
9576020	9578180	Like I'm not necessarily like trying to eavesdrop on conversations.
9578180	9581060	But like I can't like I just I can't focus on one conversation.
9581060	9582740	It's what happens the background noise.
9582740	9587380	So sometimes with like even playing games and stuff like that.
9587380	9589860	Like all of that other noise gets in the way of the dialogue.
9589860	9591220	And I have a hard time understanding.
9591220	9593140	So I prefer to play with subtitles.
9593140	9595780	I actually prefer to watch movies with closed captions too.
9596660	9600660	I will go to the theater and watch them without and be all right.
9600660	9603140	But I prefer when I'm at home to watch with closed captions.
9603140	9605300	And you know some people get really annoyed with that.
9605300	9607140	Because it's like when you're just reading them.
9607140	9611620	But I'm sorry it's just like I miss too much shit if I don't have it on.
9611620	9614260	Yeah so and I do this with games.
9614260	9617140	I far prefer to have the subtitles on in games.
9617620	9625540	So yeah anyway apparently Activision did provide a statement to the blog Game Pit.
9625540	9629060	Who said when Toys for Bob set out to make an awesome game collection.
9629060	9631780	There were certain decisions that needed to be made throughout the process.
9631780	9636500	The team remained committed to keep the integrity and legacy of Spyro that fans remembered intact.
9636500	9638660	While there's no industry standard for subtitles.
9638660	9641140	The studio and Activision care about the fans experience.
9641140	9644580	Especially with respect to accessibility for people with different abilities.
9644580	9646180	And will evaluate going forward.
9647620	9650020	Kind of a shit answer in my opinion.
9650020	9652260	They're trying to say well since the first game didn't have subtitles.
9652820	9654260	That's kind of like what they're saying basically.
9654980	9656420	Kind of a shit answer.
9656420	9658260	I think that could have been worded a lot better.
9658260	9663140	Just basically like instead they could have just kind of fessed up and said.
9663140	9666820	You know since we they weren't in the original game.
9666820	9668900	And we remastered the first game.
9668900	9670420	We neglected to include it.
9670420	9672340	But we are looking to include it in the future.
9672340	9674900	To make sure that our games are as accessible as possible.
9674900	9677380	I think there could have been a better way they could have worded that.
9677380	9680580	Maybe took a little bit of ownership.
9680580	9684260	But they did not with that statement in my humble opinion.
9685220	9687220	SSJ100Matt agrees with me in chat.
9687220	9688180	That is a shit answer.
9689060	9692180	Anyway also Pokemon Let's Go.
9692180	9694900	Getting some pushback on the motion controls.
9694900	9697300	Because the motion controls in the game are mandatory.
9697300	9700660	So of course that means that players with certain disabilities can't play.
9701220	9704500	I have only been playing with the Joy-Con to like throw the ball.
9704580	9708020	I have not played in portable mode at all.
9708020	9709540	I have played all in portable mode.
9709540	9710420	That's so interesting.
9710420	9714180	Because to me I think that's one of the reasons why I love this game.
9714180	9715940	More than like any other Pokemon game.
9715940	9718740	Is because I can play it on the fucking television finally.
9719380	9720900	And that means a lot for me.
9720900	9722660	So I like to play with the motion controls.
9722660	9724420	But regardless of how I feel.
9725060	9729620	There's you know some gamers out there that are are not able to do that motion.
9729620	9731140	Or the gyro motion.
9731140	9734180	I'm gonna throw in a few life hacks here for you for Pokemon.
9734740	9735620	Let's go as well.
9735620	9736020	All right.
9736020	9739060	So here's some fun little cheats or stuff you can do.
9739060	9745060	So because in the game you can have anybody join up with you with your Pokemon at any time.
9745060	9748420	You can actually when you're fighting trainers and stuff like that.
9748420	9750340	And you find a difficult battle.
9750340	9752660	You activate the other controller by shaking it.
9752660	9755700	Then you get to have two Pokemon out at once versus their one.
9757700	9758580	At the same time.
9758900	9760900	Hmm so anyway.
9761780	9763220	Apparently yeah.
9764100	9768020	Because you have to use some of the gyro even when you're in portable mode.
9768020	9768580	Yeah you do.
9768580	9772420	It sucks for people that can't like pick that up and hold it and do the whole thing.
9772420	9775780	So you know Nintendo's kind of getting called out on that a little bit.
9776580	9779220	But there's also some positive examples.
9779220	9781460	Eurogamer kind of spotlighted amongst all this.
9782180	9787300	Spider-Man PlayStation 4 has a lot of great accessibility features in it.
9787300	9790260	For example you can you know change things like parallaxing.
9790260	9792020	You can make subtitles gigantic.
9792580	9794980	You can do quick time events that auto complete.
9794980	9798260	You can change button taps to hold like you can really break it down.
9798260	9802500	And other games have been called out for doing accessibility right.
9802500	9807140	God of War, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Celeste are all games that really kind of go out of
9807140	9809540	their way to be more and more accessible.
9809540	9814100	So you know certainly something I think we just need to be thinking about developing
9814100	9817860	games is how can as many people as possible play this game.
9817860	9818820	You know what I mean.
9818820	9822180	There's I think it's going to be tough like when it comes to things like VR.
9822900	9826020	Like some people just aren't going to be able to do VR period.
9826020	9827300	Yeah you know what I mean.
9827300	9832420	So it's it's tough like you have to kind of ask these hard questions about well you know
9832420	9835780	how how far can we go to actually be able to include people.
9835780	9840580	You know in like a game like Beat Saber it's going to be very very very hard to make inclusive.
9841220	9841780	You know what I mean.
9842580	9845540	But I think again you just kind of have to put the question in the back of your mind.
9846580	9851300	How can we easily incorporate as many people as possible to be able to enjoy this game.
9851300	9852820	And subtitles come on.
9852820	9854180	That's an easy thing.
9854180	9855540	Like that's super easy.
9855540	9860580	Button remapping that should be like a non-issue easy easy peasy thing which is why it's built
9860580	9862900	into PlayStation firmware at this point right.
9862900	9864500	You know so anyway.
9865380	9867140	All right well let's move on.
9867140	9869780	We got a couple more stories for you guys that we're going to open up the Skype line
9869780	9872820	if anyone wants to call in at Orange Lounge Radio.
9873380	9875620	But first Loki.
9875620	9877780	We've got new Half-Life coming out.
9877780	9879300	Fan-made Half-Life of course.
9879300	9885140	So there was a whole remake of the original Half-Life called Black Mesa which came out
9885140	9886020	not too long ago.
9886660	9894260	And of course with that there was still the last part of the game which is set on the
9894260	9895380	Alien World of Xen.
9895940	9901220	So now the Black Mesa team has released a trailer for Black Mesa Xen which is going
9901220	9907540	to be the final chapter of the game which is set to be released around the second quarter
9907540	9908340	of next year.
9908340	9909540	And it looks fantastic.
9910260	9911380	It looks so great.
9912100	9919620	So you know since it's largely original work it says it'll run for about six hours and
9919620	9920340	very colorful.
9920340	9927540	I will have to ask Alan if he plans to play that because he you know he'll visit the Half-Life
9927540	9928820	series about once a year or so.
9928820	9929860	He's still on his Dark Souls.
9929860	9931300	I'm sure he's played Black Mesa.
9931300	9935540	Oh he has he has but if they're gonna like finally do that you know last sequence and
9935540	9937780	everything he'll probably go back and revisit so.
9937780	9939060	Yeah it looks pretty amazing.
9939060	9943940	Yeah and then last but certainly not least tonight I mean this is one of those things
9943940	9948260	where hello I think everybody heard this news already but we have to mention of course at
9948260	9954100	some point that Stan Lee who you know contributed so much to nerd culture you know obviously
9954100	9958980	through Marvel Comics which of course expanded into the video game universe did pass away
9958980	9961780	while we were out on break at the age of 95.
9962500	9969460	So he did pass away on Monday the what was the date the 20th just right after I think
9969460	9970500	the last Orange Lounge Radio.
9971140	9977940	He passed away it was November 12th I think was the day and he was 95 years old though
9977940	9982980	so what an amazing life I think many of us would be so fortunate to lead such an amazing
9982980	9983620	life.
9983620	9988420	Stan Lee of course behind heroes like Spider-Man the Fantastic Four the Incredible Hulk and
9988420	9992660	so on and you know he did do a lot for video games as well.
9992660	9998260	It's not you know just certainly Marvel or not just comics because Spider-Man's PlayStation
9998260	10001540	4 games he made appearances in Lego Marvel series.
10001540	10004820	He showed up in the amazing Spider-Man Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.
10004820	10009700	He actually made a cameo in DC Teen Titans goes yeah the movie believe it was hilarious.
10009700	10014020	So I mean that's cool that you know you can you know you have a little little love between
10014020	10019700	you know the fact that he had a well he had a cameo but it wasn't like a spoken cameo
10019700	10022020	it was just kind of like a little easter egg they threw in there.
10022020	10028740	Yeah so anyhow it was it was video games as well as music and I'm sure is music as well
10028740	10036180	as comics and movies and yeah I'm sure a lot of folks very sad to hear that but again
10036180	10041220	95 what a wonderful long great life and I know many people had seen him at conventions
10041220	10044100	he was doing those conventions man right up to the last year.
10044100	10048500	I remember he was at Dragon Con just a couple years ago he had a he had a floor auto himself
10048500	10052740	at Dragon Con but when you're Stan Lee that's what you get so rest in peace Stan Lee.
10053540	10057940	Let's open up the skype line Orange Lounge Radio all one word on skype if you want to
10057940	10061060	give us a call if there's something we haven't talked about on the show yet or maybe something
10061060	10065460	we did talk about that you want to lend your piece to we will open up the skype line right now
10065460	10069220	but I'm not going to keep it open very long so if you want to get in I will call pretty soon

10080980	10082980	never mind we got a call coming in right now let's get to it.
10084340	10086420	Hello you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
10086420	10089140	That's the one and only Ron how is everybody tonight?
10089140	10090500	Hey I'm great how are you doing?
10091140	10094980	Pretty good after a little chaos during Black Friday sales I can't complain.
10095780	10099460	Yeah you know I didn't go out there I mean I went out to go play video games but I didn't
10099460	10104180	I didn't fight any of the traffic at malls or things like that on Black Friday I just kind of
10104180	10109300	I kind of uh it was a normal day for well I had to work on Black Friday I don't even I don't work
10109300	10114740	retail or any of that stuff I mean you brave souls that do uh but I work an office job but
10114740	10117780	just the nature of my industry we had to be open on Friday so.
10117780	10120340	Well that's understandable so I get that.
10120340	10123700	So it's just another day for me but how was how was your weekend adventure with
10123700	10124820	all that getting any good deals?
10125700	10129460	Uh that's Spider-Man PlayStation 4 for $200 my dude.
10129460	10131780	So how are you liking PlayStation 4?
10132820	10139060	I just hooked it up it's as it's updating you open the Skype license I kind of did a backflip
10139060	10140820	from my TV over to the chair.
10142660	10144420	So a little too early to tell huh?
10144980	10149620	Yes despite the drama behind me getting it I I'm good.
10150260	10154580	Um so you picked up not just the Spider-Man that's included right but I saw because you
10154580	10158020	you gave me a shout out on Twitter thank you because you picked up Tetris Effect right?
10158020	10158820	Yes I did.
10158820	10162980	Yeah well and where's my kickback from enhanced games where's that all right uh and then you
10162980	10165940	picked up one other thing too right the Kingdom Hearts thing right?
10165940	10170340	And I actually traded in the Spider-Man game and got um Dragon Quest 11.
10171220	10174260	That's fun oh so you didn't even want the Spider-Man game?
10175620	10179140	For giving me reasons I'm like you have to understand something.
10179140	10185780	I have a very eclectic taste in video games like I can't stand a lot of RTS type games
10185780	10190820	but I can sit there and play Command and Conquer the Age of Series the Project Crow I can sit
10190820	10195380	there play those all day I'll stare at Final Fantasy Tactics go two rounds like I'm done
10195380	10199140	with this all right very eclectic taste.
10199140	10203380	That's why I consider myself pretty eclectic when it comes to games too but you know there's
10203380	10207140	certain things that I'm just never gonna gel with like Call of Duty but even then like
10207140	10209220	I watch other people play it and I go this is pretty.
10209940	10213620	I will sit there and play Battlefield I picked up Battlefield because it was free I'm like
10213620	10218180	I won't pay $60 for it I might pay $10 but you know free free is free.
10218180	10218900	Yeah free is free.
10220740	10226020	I didn't want to go on about uh my PS4 I'm just here to back up a lot of what you said
10226020	10232660	about E3 okay I'm walking home I'm screaming to the world that you are preaching the gospel
10232660	10238340	about E3 and PAX and all of that I'm like this is part of the reason why I stopped going to PAX.
10239220	10243460	And you care to elaborate what do you what do you think I got right on this?
10244180	10251220	It's not fun anymore PAX was fan run now it's industry run I have heard from people that
10251220	10257780	you can't get as much free swag anymore it's harder to get badges it's more of a glorified
10257780	10264020	dealers hall than anything else I mean with the way technology is going the fact that Sony's
10264020	10268900	off doing their own thing it's not surprising everybody else is plus the fact that you have
10268900	10273860	like smaller gaming conventions popping up and indie companies are going to and sometimes you
10273860	10279940	might find a third-party company going to showing stuff off and also let's say there is this awesome
10279940	10286260	game coming out at E3 and you have to be one of the elite few to try it out you ain't got to worry
10286260	10293700	about that because if you wait a few weeks that company Sony EA whoever will be at New York comic
10293700	10298340	con with the game and you can hop on the line and play it then or this convention where you can hop
10298340	10302100	on the line and play it then or you just watch it all on YouTube we don't even have to wait at all.
10303220	10310660	Exactly I mean I had a friend who was all hyped about going to E3 last year she hasn't mentioned
10310660	10317060	anything about going this year because even though they opened it up to the general public
10317060	10323940	a lot of convention goers are not used to have E3 runs yes I'm gonna go to like comic cons
10323940	10330340	and and other stuff where it kind of closes at eight you saw panels going on like 10 o'clock
10330340	10338580	oh yeah but E3 there really is no panels it's just rows of demos and other stuff and then it's over
10338580	10342820	you can find your friends or see if you can get into an industry party or something like that
10342820	10347860	you know even this Final Fantasy thing was over at six o'clock Friday and Saturday so it was
10347860	10351380	no more like eight o'clock because the concerts but still kind of left that whole evening where
10351380	10354500	it's like well what do we do now oh well at least we're in Las Vegas and we can hang with
10354500	10360660	our guildies you know what I mean so there's that so you know I do I do want to point out
10360660	10366340	though just just to be clear you know you know the moment when E3 I kind of had my aha moment about
10366340	10370100	I'm not sure this is worth the money to come down here and take off work for this anymore you know
10370100	10376500	when the moment was well it was the year the last year I went when we were basically we had to
10376500	10383140	justify ourselves as a legitimate press outlet to get tickets to this Assassin's Creed theater
10383140	10390020	experience wait in line once we have tickets to get in the Assassin's Creed thing finally watch
10390020	10394340	the thing which looked neat I was you know I'm not even a huge Assassin's Creed person and I was like
10394340	10400980	oh I was into it and then come to find out the whole thing's on YouTube already so that thing I
10400980	10406340	had to fight and wait in line for it was just there on YouTube going to see it Rob you see it
10406340	10411780	right now but I'm rolling my eyes so hard in the back of my head about that I'm like are you fucking
10411780	10417780	kidding but that's that's the reality of you know a big piece of where E3 kind of lost its luster
10417780	10422260	where I'm like again if I could just watch this on YouTube why am I coming down here to spend all
10422260	10429220	this money you know it's that's what it is and the fact that it's just crowds and you know I
10429220	10437060	already said it if I have to take personal time off to sit in front of my computer to get my
10437060	10445460	tickets my hotel rooms if I gotta get a squad together to do that that's it to me the convention
10445460	10452900	is not worth going through that for I refuse yeah so and Bobby kind of says in chat you know kind
10452900	10457380	of a hits home type of comment I gave up on E3 when they told me I wasn't legit anymore even
10457380	10462340	with my LLC in my audience I got tired of fighting Pax said the same thing to me and I gave up on them
10462340	10469540	too but I remember when Bobby put together at Pax the little indie podcast alley one year at Pax
10470580	10474020	that was through the whole all games thing that we had one year when we were with them
10474020	10484020	so it's crazy to me how like that attitude is gone see you know I feel you I used to be able
10484020	10491220	to do press for Comic-Con but as it would more industry when they denied me I said it ain't worth
10491220	10498260	it they told me I did not have enough hits on my site for them to give me a press pass and it's not
10498260	10502260	like it's not like I don't want to make this clear because I don't want people being like oh they're
10502260	10506500	whining or it's the ego or something like that it's not really that but it's this whole thing
10506500	10511140	where it's like well if you don't want me why am I going to bother going and I just I get so much
10511140	10517140	more out of fan run expos that's why I love Dragon Con fan run magfest was a lot of fun fan fan run
10517140	10523380	like I'm just getting more rewards being a loud ass fan which I think is a good way to describe
10523380	10532020	a podcaster or a twitch streamer a loud ass fan exactly we tend to succeed at fan cons oh speaking
10532500	10535780	let me tell you this quick story let me get out of here there's a small local convention
10536500	10542340	I kind of had a I guess a one-sided argument with them they denied me press I'm just like can you
10542340	10547620	tell me the reason why because I like to know why that way I can fix things for the following year
10547620	10555780	learn from that you know they told me that my press site wasn't good enough because we're not
10555780	10563060	like the local newspaper or the tv station I'm sorry abc is not going to send a newsman to your
10563060	10569060	little podoc convention to do coverage when a local newspaper does that they're going to
10569060	10574740	write up a little page little story two pictures tops you got small press lights like myself that
10574740	10580340	will go around and take hundreds of pictures interview all these people and put all this
10580340	10585700	content up ab abc is going to come out there and get pictures of all the people in costume and be
10586340	10589780	look what's going on at the hilton this week and then they'll show you know people dressed
10589780	10595940	in costume behind the current temperatures that's what's gonna happen mm-hmm well anyway
10596580	10600180	all right uh rama I'm gonna let you go to see if we get any more calls in but any other thoughts
10600180	10607620	for our listeners tonight um I don't have any right now but it is what it is all right well
10607620	10612980	take care of my friend youtube brother all right bye all right uh orange lounge radio all one word
10613060	10618180	on skype bob bobbie's popping off in chat but he sees right on the money bobbie says my favorite
10618180	10622820	pack story was that they invited rob and i to be on a panel about building a podcast community
10622820	10627860	they removed the panel from the schedule and then denied us press passes i i forgot that that
10627860	10635460	happened because that was so shitty i don't have i i honestly don't have another word for it sorry
10635460	10640180	and maybe that explains where some of my bitterness from packs comes from but that was so shitty like
10640180	10646260	or wasn't there like a year where they like denied a press passes or something even though
10646260	10652500	like we were part of like the microsoft you know like we had our icon stuff the podcasting
10652500	10661460	communities like we had our own you know i'm sure that was e3 or gamertag ridiculous uh but we you
10661460	10667860	know we're we're recognized we see we have our own thing on xbox you get your own gamertag with our
10668180	10672580	picture you know what and i remember that because bobbie says we we had a listener who bought extra
10672580	10676100	passes sold us to face value because we had already booked the travel and hotel that's why
10676100	10679540	it was so shitty because i'd already spent my money to go out there so i could be on this
10679540	10685860	fucking panel and then they didn't even end up doing it so whatever you know what i'm doing
10685860	10691620	great panels at other cons so that's that but that was i mean what else would you call it we
10691620	10696420	booked travel and hotel and then we can't even get tickets because they pulled it at the last minute
10696420	10702660	and then god yeah i don't even know if i ever really i i don't i don't know if i ever properly
10702660	10706980	popped off on that on the show because i was still trying to maintain some sense of you know
10706980	10712020	professionalism oh maybe we'll give you invited back next year but in my old age i give less and
10712020	10717620	less of a fuck so there you go that's that's the real tea on what happened with uh packs but then
10717620	10723060	i mean we were there and not only is that like in the back of my head but just the whole time
10723060	10730180	i'm at this convention going this solo sucks anyway except packs that's what that's kind of
10730180	10734340	just how that year was for me except the people the people are awesome and the people are wonderful
10734340	10739540	and all that so all right uh let's see we'll give one more chance for any calls to come in at orange
10739540	10744500	lounge radio all one word on uh skype uh meanwhile while we wait for that call to come in uh loki any
10744500	10749460	other last minute stories to talk about no i didn't have anything but i did see like you know
10749460	10755700	rumor thread or whatever talking about the whole sony not going to um you know e3 and stuff like
10755700	10759940	that and the one the rumors was well you know those games they've been showing off at e3 last
10759940	10764260	year well those are all going to be launch titles for the new system so they can't really show off
10764260	10770340	those again because it's going to be i don't know that they might move those to launch titles but
10770340	10775380	i would say then what the hell's going to come out in 2019 which no i don't i don't understand i
10775380	10781060	mean you might have something that kind of does both like especially if playstation 5 is backwards
10781060	10788020	compatible with playstation 4 titles then you which i like sony backwards compatible look i know
10788020	10793380	bitch but i hope sony's fucking figure that out at this point right but it's kind of like when like
10793380	10797540	when the weu came out i feel like there were still some last minute we games they were kind of like
10797540	10801620	trying to push like oh but you can play them on the weu so they're for both systems like wasn't
10801620	10806020	that when finally like the operation rainfall shit started coming out like the the which i
10806020	10809940	don't even remember all those games now isn't that horrible like the the tower pandora's tower was
10809940	10814420	that one of the games i don't remember the guardian i can't even remember those games
10814420	10818260	somebody in chow helped me out but like all those games were like finally coming out at the end of
10818260	10822660	wheeze run and so they were kind of like saying well they're kind of like also launch titles for
10822660	10827700	the weu and that whole thing oh yeah and bobby blackwell points out breath of the wild was still
10827700	10833940	on weu that's right thank you act deft uh tower of pandora the last story and zena blake chronicle

10895620	10904180	from tomorrow i get jury duty oh boy i am not looking for that you know best to get it around
10904180	10908020	the holidays though because it's gonna be like so much time off then you're less likely to get those
10908020	10912420	trials that are gonna go on and on and on and on um yeah it's just it's a it's just an inconvenience
10912420	10916820	because i'm normally the one who drops off the kids so i'm not inconvenienced you know so i'm
10916820	10922260	not give me the one normally like last time i had jury duty i was in the call center so i was like
10922260	10926820	let's let's get on the fucking longest trial in the face of the earth you know because i don't
10926820	10931620	want to go back to the call center and now i'm not in the call center so it sucks again i haven't
10931620	10937780	been on jury duty so i was on a jury in 2006 right for like probably about two weeks and then i i got
10937780	10944020	it again the next year and i haven't gotten it since knock on wood yeah because uh yeah i'm no
10944020	10947860	there might have been one time since then i think when i was working in my current employer i got
10947860	10952420	the notice but like it was one of those my group number never got called in well we'll see i don't
10952420	10956900	know if i have to go in yet um you know it's since it's on a monday i'll find out i guess on
10956900	10962180	that friday or this friday so we'll see but it sucks it's just like it's an inconvenience because
10962180	10966980	it's in the middle of sacramento if it was like you know elk placerville or something like that
10966980	10973220	would be some big deal but whatever uh st100 matt says damn i remember that trial rob was on i feel
10973220	10979700	old uh st100 matt you are i wish i could say something comforting but that was 2006 you have
