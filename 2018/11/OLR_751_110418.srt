00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Present Period, Petey Piranha picked a pot to push. Petey Piranha pushes paladins anything but peacefully. Petey Piranha pushes in participation and prepares for pressure to pile paladins into a pit. Phew. Please present your presents on the presentation where every player plays a part.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Slow clap for Jason, that was amazing. Hi, it's Rob and welcome to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio here live with episode number 751 for this November the 4th of 2018. I of course am Rob Roberts, he is Techmaster Loki.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hello. Hi Loki, how are you doing? I'm fine. Good, good. Good to have you back of course for another week.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Not here for another week, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Well, she will be joining us later thanks to Radio Magic, but sadly as you know her work schedule has her occupied otherwise for a little bit longer.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So we hope to welcome her back full time real soon. I know she'll pop in for a show later in the month in studio kind of like she was last week for our big 750th episode.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But now we're at 751, so only what 249 after tonight, then we hit 1000, then we're done, right? No podcast hits 1000 weekly episodes, right? Nobody's that crazy. I'm that crazy. Yes, you are that crazy.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hello to all you crazy people who listen along with us, and I say that in the best possible way. Of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:52,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Again, that's vognetwork.com where we have chatters like VidPower who ask, how many takes did it take to do that intro right?

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't know. I didn't ask Jason. I do know that was his second script. He said he changed it. He said grab this new one, not the first one I used. So I bet I didn't catch all the differences.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Are you saying he flipped the script? He did. He flipped the script, but he can do that. It's this little creative thing we let him do because Jason does great jobs with the intro, as you heard tonight.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Brad from Pod Culture, of course, wants to know the question of the week. What did Loki bring to eat? You went to the fried chicken place again, right?

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah, I went to the fried chicken place. I got their chicken strips, which probably shouldn't have gotten those because those are just, they look like they're the ones that you find anywhere.

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That they probably were frozen and they just threw them in a deep fryer. And they don't really have any dipping sauces aside from this generic ranch to go along with it. So it's just kind of bland.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But garlic fries.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But garlic fries are great. And the waffle is great.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We got a lot of gaming news to cover tonight, so let's just jump right in. We had a lot going on in gaming this week thanks to BlizzCon, which is always a huge convention.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Blizzard is a very large gaming company that makes games that have really changed the industry, like World of Warcraft, Diablo. Certainly a lot of people really love that series.

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Rock and roll racing.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Absolutely, The Lost Vikings, Starcraft and what that did for competitive gaming, especially we know in Korea and stuff, Starcraft is a huge deal.

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And of course Overwatch is really changing the game now in this day and age. Overwatch is really taking esports to another level thanks to the Overwatch League.

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But lots of interesting stuff out of BlizzCon, right? This year's BlizzCon, not without controversy, which I'm sure you're all waiting for us to get into.

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But let's make sure we talk about everything. So what did we get at BlizzCon this year, Loki?

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Well we got announcements, announcements, and more announcements.

27
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well that's what they do at BlizzCon. You pay $200 to go hear announcements.

28
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes. So new expansion for World of Warcraft?

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Sorta. I know you don't play well. It's a patch expansion.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Whatever. Patch expansion. You get it for free.

31
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Ok, so we're gonna talk a lot tonight about language in marketing.

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Cause you all know what this is gonna come down to.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But this is one reason why. So Blizzard tricked you just the way they want to trick you.

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You thought it was a new expansion, but it's not. It's just a new patch that they give a fancy name to that's part of the Battle for Azeroth expansion.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But it makes it sound like, oh it's this whole new thing.

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And it does bring new stuff to the game. Certainly if you're a World of Warcraft fan, you are very much looking forward to it.

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sure WoW based shows like Girls Gone WoW here on this very network will spend much time talking about this new patch.

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But it is not what we would usually consider a new expansion, meaning retail release, box, $60 price tag, that whole type of thing.

39
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's just the newest patch. And considering the Battle for Azeroth is very story heavy.

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
A lot of people kind of want to know where the story is gonna go. And who the new allied races are gonna be and all that stuff.

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Anyway, I won't bore you with all those details. Cause I know we have a lot of people that don't play WoW here on this show.

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But it's more stuff for the WoW fan base.

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah. They also announced the Warcraft 3 remaster that's gonna be coming out.

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That has a lot of people excited. I don't think I've heard a negative thing about that.

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That looks pretty awesome. 4K. And they even have another version of it that has some of the DLCs.

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Or the expansion packs that they had from Warcraft 3.

47
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, they kind of get into some of the story that you play out in World of Warcraft.

48
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Kind of like how the Lich King came to be and all that. That was the Frozen Throne expansion in Warcraft 3.

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
As much as I know about Warcraft lore now, thanks to my time with World of Warcraft, I actually didn't play a lot of Warcraft 3 back in the day.

50
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't even think I ever owned it. I think I had a person I used to date that owned it and I kind of played it that way.

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But never really bought it myself. So I'm kind of interested in checking it out.

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And you know a lot of stuff was born of Warcraft 3's mods.

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Such as the modern lane based MOBA is born from Warcraft 3.

54
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's where Defense of the Ancients was the mod. Or Dota.

55
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You ever wondered why Valve has Dota 2 and where the hell is Dota 1?

56
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's because Dota 1 was a mod for Warcraft 3.

57
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Just like when Valve released Team Fortress 2, that's because the original Team Fortress was a Quake mod.

58
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So Valve, at least for a while, they've been kind of quiet for a few years, but at least for a while was notorious for hiring the modding community to make new games.

59
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Such as those examples.

60
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So anyway, hopefully the mod support will be back in Warcraft 3 because that would be pretty exciting to play the original Defense of the Ancients and all that again.

61
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It might be exciting. I don't think they talked a lot about that.

62
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No. New character announced for Overwatch, Ashe.

63
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Female McCree, kind of. But with a shotgun.

64
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Basically McCree's antithesis, but female.

65
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Voiced by Jennifer Hale, which is great because Jennifer Hale is a big name in the voice acting side of business.

66
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
She's done a lot of the BioWare, FemShep.

67
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Our own Bobby Blackwolf is very proud of the bumper he has featuring Jennifer Hale.

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I met her once at one of the many gamer exes, one of the ones she was at, and she's great.

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
A lot of people know who she is and it's kind of one of those, well it's about time they found a way to put her in Overwatch.

70
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So win-win all around. I don't think anybody's upset about Ashe at all.

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
She has a shotgun, which I didn't realize really is.

72
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I guess because I always kind of assumed that Roadhog's weapon was kind of like a shotgun, but it's really not.

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's more like a chaingun.

74
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So yeah, I mean, makes a lot of sense.

75
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We needed a shotgun hero in Overwatch, so now you got Ashe.

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Doesn't Junkrat have...

77
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No, because Junkrat uses all those grenades. His big thing is the grenade launcher.

78
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I've literally played maybe an hour's worth of Overwatch.

79
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's fun, but...

80
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I have it. I own the game.

81
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well then you're going to get Ashe because they don't charge for the character, so you'll get Ashe for free.

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Alright.

83
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Vidpower in chat says, thank you Overwatch team for the new female character.

84
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, Blizzard got red to filth for some of their stereotypes and the way they presented characters several years ago.

85
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Not enough jetpack, Kat.

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And Overwatch has been a big change, and I think Blizzard has been applauded for that.

87
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And yeah, I think some girl power's a great thing.

88
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I did not pay attention if there was any updates to Heroes of the Storm. I assume that there was.

89
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
There was. They announced, actually the kind of big deal with Heroes of the Storm is that they have a brand new hero, Ophelia?

90
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Ophelia? I'm butchering her name, but it's something like that.

91
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But the twist is, she is not from a Blizzard game.

92
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So, you know, Heroes of the Storm has always been about characters all from other Blizzard games.

93
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Including tracers in there from Overwatch and Lucio and some of the big names from Overwatch are in there.

94
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Then you have the monk from Diablo 3, the crusader, but they give him names.

95
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The crusader is Johanna, they give him names.

96
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So basically all of Blizzard's franchises, that's where all the characters come from.

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And probably the deepest cut they did was when they put the lost Vikings in the game.

98
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Because they had to make a new category for Blizzard Classic.

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Well now you've got basically a character born from the Nexus.

100
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So Blizzard has said, essentially we're going to start creating new characters.

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So that's what they did with Ophelia. Sorry, I'm butchering her name.

102
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But she's kind of like a dark mage, but she carries a big shield.

103
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Interesting though because Blizzard still could have tapped from many different Overwatch characters if they wanted to.

104
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I believe they're still missing some of the Diablo and Diablo 2 class representation.

105
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sure they could have put some of the new WoW characters like Princess Taraji.

106
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Some of the characters they're introducing in Battle for Azeroth.

107
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
If they really wanted to, they could put some of the new.

108
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But for whatever reason, this is the direction they want to go in.

109
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But I mean, I've played a lot of Heroes of the Storm. I don't hate it.

110
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's interesting. Okay, sure. Let me do some new stuff.

111
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And I don't know anything about Hearthstone either.

112
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Honestly, I hope the Hearthstone fans don't get mad.

113
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But it's basically par for the course that you get a new card expansion.

114
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's a new expansion, new cards.

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The cards do some different things.

116
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Overkill is a brand new thing that's going to be on the cards.

117
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Which means you get a special effect if you overkill.

118
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Meaning you use more points of damage than it would normally take to kill the character.

119
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If you overkill, you'll kind of set off an extra mod.

120
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Little things like that.

121
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The expansion, if I remember right, is based on the Loa lore from Battle for Azeroth.

122
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Which is explored with the trolls on the Horde side.

123
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's kind of like the gods they believe in.

124
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll kind of leave it at that. I don't want to bore you with all the details.

125
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But that's where Hearthstone is going with that.

126
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And then, and then...

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Wait, wait. Before you get to the big one. Wow Classic, right?

128
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So they gave a date for World of Warcraft Classic.

129
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's going to be summer of 2019.

130
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
No, I had another big one.

131
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh, okay. No, I know why I said before you get to the big one.

132
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, no. There's another big one.

133
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, okay, okay.

134
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They're invading your breakfast.

135
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh, that is a big one.

136
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah, they dropped that on the pre-show stream.

137
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I was surprised about that. Tell us more.

138
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, so they're going to have, I don't remember what the cereal is called.

139
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But it's basically Overwatch cereal.

140
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And it's Lucio's.

141
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Lucio's, yes.

142
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Which they have referenced in the game before.

143
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And I actually have a Lucio's shirt.

144
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So, how funny.

145
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Here I am thinking I was buying a shirt that's like an inside joke to Overwatch.

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Because, you know, it's like a joke in the game.

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And now, oh, I spent money on something that is now free advertising for Kellogg's.

148
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's great.

149
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But no, I love that it's a real thing. It's funny.

150
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah, speaking of Kellogg's, I actually was able to pick up a box of Super Mario cereal today.

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, that still exists? You can actually get that?

152
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, they have it over at WinCo now.

153
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh, okay. Oh, shit.

154
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I saw it because I've been looking for that and the kids saw that and I'm like,

155
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
sure, you can have this Lucky Charms knockoff. There you go.

156
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's the one with the cereal box amiibo, right?

157
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They don't have that anymore.

158
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's just cereal now.

159
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No wonder you can just overprice cereal now.

160
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, well, you know the Lucio's is supposed to come with a loot box of some sort.

161
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't know if it's a full loot box or a special loot box, but that cereal is going to be impossible to find.

162
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So good luck.

163
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's going to be like that Super Mario cereal.

164
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And I bet you, not that I would encourage this.

165
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't encourage this, but I think it's going to happen anyway.

166
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
People are going to buy that Lucio cereal and flip it on eBay and flip it, you know, to get,

167
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
especially if the loot box has something unique in it, which I don't think it will.

168
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't think they were saying anything about that.

169
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I think it's just like a regular, you know, loot box that you get from like leveling up and stuff.

170
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But yeah, I can really see people trying to flip that cereal, which is kind of interesting.

171
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Ridiculous.

172
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But I love that Lucio's are a real thing.

173
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And then, okay, so I guess we'll get into the announcements.

174
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes, please.

175
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So the new Diablo announcements.

176
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So the Diablo 3 switch that came out finally.

177
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It was the same day as the start of BlizzCon.

178
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So, I mean, that was kind of like their big, like, hey, if you want to check out Diablo 3 on Switch, you can starting today.

179
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And then now it's Diablo, the next Diablo.

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And everyone's like, whoa, what is that? What is that?

181
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And they're like, you know, in the same vein of Command and Conquer, we're going mobile.

182
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's Diablo immortal, folks.

183
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What's that look for?

184
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Don't you guys have phones?

185
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Come on.

186
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Don't you use your cell phones and you're talking and you're Twittering and you're Facebooking and Instagram.

187
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You assholes are all on social media right now tweeting about how much you hate me on your phone.

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
A phone you can use to play Diablo Immortal.

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I actually, I got to say, I kind of felt bad for that guy.

190
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Like, he kind of looked like he had a little bit of stage fright going on.

191
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Like there was some weird stuff was happening with the BlizzCon opening, like, because like the sound on the Hearthstone stage didn't work.

192
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So they were clearly having to like shuffle it on the fly because they did the Warcraft 3 thing and then they went back to Hearthstone.

193
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So they kind of had to like do it out of order a little bit.

194
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So I think everybody was like a little thrown off from that.

195
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But like, he just looked very like there was parts of it that was like deer in headlights.

196
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And like, I'm not, I'm not here to personally make fun of somebody whose job it is to probably make games.

197
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And, you know, the fact that he has to, you know, get up on the stage is, you know, not everybody can do it.

198
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And for the most part, he did a good job.

199
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But I think we all have seen the part where he kind of put his foot in his mouth a little bit when he was like,

200
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
well, don't y'all have phones when?

201
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes, but that doesn't mean we're all here at BlizzCon because we're fans of mobile games.

202
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So, yeah.

203
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Anything else you want to say on this, Loki?

204
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Because I get a book.

205
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah, everybody, I got it like a 15 minute rant on this.

206
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I hear, based on what's been seen of it so far, the company it's making, because it isn't actually Blizzard that's developing the game.

207
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's another company, I think.

208
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah.

209
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And the company that, they have a game that's basically a knockoff of Diablo.

210
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And it's like, they're saying that this looks like a knockoff of Diablo, except it's an official Diablo game.

211
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But it resembles a knockoff of Diablo.

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So take that as you will.

213
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Alright, so let's talk about this whole debacle.

214
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Because we've seen, just the internet has just exploded with a lot of negativity around this game.

215
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And, you know, actually it wasn't just on the internet, some of it was happening in person.

216
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Somebody had the balls to get up there in front of everybody and ask the question,

217
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
is this an April Fool's joke?

218
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You know, completely stone faced, you know, to the developer's face to ask that type of question.

219
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
This is just some type of April Fool's joke.

220
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And like, okay, I understand that you feel very like, you know, wronged or whatever by what happened.

221
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But like, I couldn't help but feel like, dude, you paid $200 to be at BlizzCon.

222
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And I just had that DJ Khalid in my mind.

223
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Khalid, I had him in my mind where that, congrats, you played yourself.

224
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Like that's honestly like the image that came to my mind is like, you paid $200 to Blizzard

225
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
so you could go there and just like ask something kind of like,

226
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
why are you even at the panel if you're not like feeling the game?

227
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Did you just go to be rude?

228
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Like it's so, I don't know, like it just, that left a bad taste in my mouth.

229
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But to be fair, the response wasn't exactly great either.

230
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What if the response had been something more like this?

231
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Ask me the question, Logan. Pretend you are angry, you are angry dude over free mobile game.

232
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Ask me the question, I'm going to pretend I'm developer from Diablo.

233
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Is this like an April Fool's joke or something like that?

234
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I mean, where's the real game?

235
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
No, no, it's not a joke.

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Look, here's the thing is that as we announced online a couple weeks ago,

237
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
we have multiple Diablo projects in development right now.

238
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And we know our PC fans are not going to be disappointed.

239
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But what we're trying to do right now is we're trying to grow our market

240
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
into other places where mobile phone gaming is really big.

241
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I mean, after all, everybody does have a mobile phone,

242
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
so we want you to be able to take this Diablo experience on the go.

243
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And we think this is something that can hold you over until the next big Diablo experience.

244
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Wow, that is a great response and not at all, you know, entitled.

245
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So would that response have been better, Logan?

246
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That would have been better than what they did.

247
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Exactly.

248
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But then again, much like we've learned with Office Space,

249
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
sometimes the developers aren't the best people to be talking directly to the public.

250
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Right, and the difference between me and him, to his credit,

251
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I have 15 plus years of making shit up on the spot and having dialogue

252
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
thanks to this little program called Orange Lounge Radio.

253
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This person probably had media training, which probably doesn't cover quite all the bases.

254
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So while we're talking about messaging and while we're roleplaying

255
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
this Rob Roberts runs Blizzard scenario here, how about this, Loki?

256
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
How do you think maybe the message would have been different if,

257
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and I ask everybody in chat this as well.

258
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Actually, I want to see if there's any comments there in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

259
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
ActDev says, Rob for Blizzard PR.

260
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
My worries, and this is also a worry that people have with the fact that it's a mobile game,

261
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
is that they're thinking that Activision is running this ship basically.

262
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And Activision, when it comes to free-to-play models,

263
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
or even not free-to-play models, but treating them as free-to-play models,

264
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
they milk the fucking shit out of that.

265
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
All of the things that you hate about mobile games will be in this mobile game,

266
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
is what their fear is.

267
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And looking at EA, same thing.

268
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
EA did the same shit with Command & Conquer, and they thought,

269
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
what, why are you guys angry? We gave you a new Command & Conquer, what the hell?

270
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Right.

271
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You know, it's just tone deaf, I guess.

272
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Well, and let's, if we're going to run with this whole,

273
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Rob is going to run Blizzard PR for a minute,

274
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
how would you guys feel if BlizzardCon had gone like this?

275
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Instead of Diablo Immortal being the last announcement,

276
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Warcraft III Remastered is the last announcement.

277
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I haven't heard anything negative about the Warcraft III Remastered thing.

278
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Have you heard anything negative about Warcraft III Remastered?

279
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Nope.

280
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So you can get away with remastering a game that's a classic game

281
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
that most people really like, and doing that in 4K and modernizing it,

282
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
and I think people are going to be okay with that.

283
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So, first things first, we're going to make Warcraft III Remastered

284
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
the last announcement.

285
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So before that, we'll get into Diablo.

286
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And so I'm going to be the dude that comes up on stage,

287
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and I'm going to start it off something like this.

288
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Hey everybody, and welcome, hope you're having a wonderful BlizzCon,

289
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and we have a lot of exciting stuff going on in the Diablo universe.

290
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You know, we wrote an open letter to all of you a few weeks ago

291
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
that talked about that we have many Diablo products in the works,

292
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and we have several, but I'm here to talk to you about the first one

293
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
that you can expect today.

294
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
This project is called Diablo Immortal,

295
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and it's actually a special, unique Diablo experience

296
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
developed for mobile phones.

297
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You know, everybody has a mobile phone, and mobile phones are growing,

298
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and we want to invite everybody to participate in the Diablo experience,

299
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
because this is a universe we want everybody to enjoy.

300
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You know, show the trailer, show the hype, you know, build all that stuff,

301
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and then continue.

302
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Diablo Immortal is actually playable on the show floor today,

303
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
and we hope you'll all have a chance to play it.

304
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And I hope to be back real soon to talk to you about what's next for Diablo,

305
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
because I know what you're all waiting for.

306
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Right? How's that? How's that?

307
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Much better.

308
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Much better, thank you.

309
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So, a lot of that is in the messaging, right?

310
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And this is a very, like, this whole way this is blown up and everything

311
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
is a very interesting study in like Blizzard,

312
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and like messaging in general, not just like Blizzard specifically,

313
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
but this is the type of thing that like video game PR people

314
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
are going to study for a long, long time.

315
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Because Blizzard's fan base, as we've talked about on OLR before,

316
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
is a very, like, usually loyal fan base.

317
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I mean, you know, I think part of the reason that Overwatch took off

318
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
in the first place is that all these people who usually wouldn't play

319
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
first person shooters did it because Blizzard did it.

320
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And Blizzard made a version of it that was very accessible

321
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
that people wanted to play, and I think that got people very excited.

322
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I think Blizzard did make an error in assuming that their company

323
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
that has been founded around these PC, primarily, I think it's fair,

324
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
yes, of course they have console releases too,

325
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
but those are usually the sideshows, right?

326
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Most of their releases are PC.

327
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
They've always been a very PC-based company.

328
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The fact that, you know, their tentpole announcement of BlizzCon

329
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
essentially was, well, you PC fans, guess what?

330
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We've got a mobile game for you, and it's actually a PC game

331
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
that you all know and love from PC.

332
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We're putting it on a mobile device.

333
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And I think that's why a lot of people are very like,

334
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
like, if the project had been something like,

335
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and I know you're all going to laugh at me, but I don't give a fuck,

336
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
like Diablo Go, like something like Pokemon Go

337
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
or something that is just not Diablo 3 looking on a cell phone,

338
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
it'd been like a completely different type of game,

339
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I wonder if people would have had the same very negative reaction to it.

340
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Probably, yeah.

341
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But here's the other thing with that.

342
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm not going to completely say that Blizzard is 100% in the wrong here,

343
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
because, I mean, it does make a lot of sense to do mobile phone games.

344
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
There's a lot of companies making a lot of money off of mobile games.

345
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I do think Diablo as a mobile game is probably an idea

346
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
that would have been better about three, four years ago,

347
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
but this is where Blizzard's slow development calendar

348
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
to take the time to get everything right,

349
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
this is one of those, I hate to say it,

350
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
this is one of those places where that kind of hurts them, I think,

351
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
is that they're a little late to the party with Diablo Immortal.

352
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Whatever, I mean, that's actually not the biggest sin,

353
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
so you're a little late to the game, whatever.

354
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I do think, though, that a lot of people are really kidding themselves

355
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
when they talk about how much they hate this game,

356
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
because here's the reality, this is a free game,

357
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
all these haters out there and stuff, they're going to download it,

358
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
they're going to try it, you can tell me all you want,

359
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
nah, nah, nah, I'm not going to, yes you are.

360
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You're going to try it because it's free.

361
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm not saying the game's going to be successful,

362
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm not saying the game's going to make oodles of money,

363
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
but I seem to remember when Nintendo first announced Miitomo,

364
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and then subsequently Super Mario Run,

365
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
there was a little bit of negativity on those games as well.

366
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You know what, a lot of people downloaded those games anyway.

367
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Now, to be fair, I also realized that Super Mario Run

368
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
ended up kind of getting a lot of flack,

369
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and Nintendo did not consider that game a success

370
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
because just because of the fact people downloaded it

371
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
didn't mean that people ended up dropping the $10

372
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
to actually buy the levels.

373
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So it's like Super Mario Run had a ton of people

374
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
that downloaded it for free to check it out,

375
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and then very few of that actually converted over.

376
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So I'm not saying necessarily that Diablo Immortal

377
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
is going to be this runaway success of a game,

378
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
but I do think there's a lot of people out there

379
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
that are kidding themselves when they say they're not even going to try it.

380
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Sorry, I don't believe it.

381
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So, you know, maybe people will now go further out of spite or whatever,

382
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
but the reality is it's free.

383
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
There's going to be at least a lot of people who downloaded

384
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
to tell their friends, oh, I played it and it sucks.

385
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I don't know. Maybe it won't suck? I don't know.

386
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You know, I would be kind of a hypocrite to sit here and say,

387
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm going to hate this game just because it's a mobile game

388
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
when I spend all the time I do playing things like

389
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Ingress, Pokemon Go, and I responded pretty favorably

390
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
to Nintendo's latest offering, which is more of an original game.

391
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Dragalia Lost is actually not a bad mobile game at all.

392
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So I'm not necessarily ready to write Diablo off completely

393
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
because it's a mobile game.

394
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I just think their messaging, all they had to do,

395
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
all they had to do, Loki, just show a logo for Diablo IV.

396
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Just show the fucking logo for Diablo IV. That's it.

397
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Pull a Nintendo.

398
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Why not?

399
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Sure.

400
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Pull a Bethesda.

401
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What did Bethesda do?

402
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
What did Bethesda do?

403
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And they're not getting Reddit for this at all.

404
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Bethesda announced that the next Elder Scrolls game

405
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
is going to be a mobile game.

406
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's a mobile game that they're going to put on PlayStation 4 and Switch, yes.

407
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But the next Elder Scrolls game is a mobile game.

408
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Did you all forget Bethesda just did a similar thing at E3

409
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and did not get dragged over the coals for this?

410
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Bethesda announced their next Elder Scrolls,

411
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
this big series where everybody's waiting for the next one,

412
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
is a mobile game.

413
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But the reason why they didn't get fucking dragged,

414
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
because what did they immediately, immediately follow it up with?

415
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
What was the very next announcement?

416
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Well, a couple that star...

417
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm using hyperbole. What was the next announcement?

418
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Elder Scrolls VI.

419
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Elder Scrolls VI.

420
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And all they did was they showed, like, a painting,

421
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
a little drumbeat, and the Elder Scrolls VI logo.

422
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And you know that game ain't fucking coming out for years.

423
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And it'll still be buggy when it's released.

424
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yet, did anybody give that mobile Elder Scrolls shit?

425
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Nope.

426
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Now, I'm sure some will want to argue,

427
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
but the mobile thing doesn't look like a reskin of an existing game,

428
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
but we're getting in the weeds a little bit here, okay?

429
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm saying is that messaging is, like, really important.

430
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
That's my point, okay?

431
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I don't really know this Diablo game truly, truly,

432
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
until I actually get my hands on it to play it.

433
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
So anyway, little rant there.

434
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
All right.

435
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

436
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
DungeonBuster in chat says,

437
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm not surprised that Blizzard did this with Diablo.

438
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
In a way, it was kind of inevitable.

439
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Let's see, DungeonBuster also says,

440
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Blizzard needs to make money,

441
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and that money is going to be used to fund other projects

442
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
that they will be working on.

443
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Hopefully, one of those projects will be on better messaging.

444
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
As H2O 100 Matt points out,

445
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Hearthstone got so much shit when it was announced,

446
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
it got 25 million downloads within the first three months of its release.

447
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Let's see, Tigerclaw says,

448
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Here's an idea.

449
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Make a new StarCraft or a new sequel one of their classic games.

450
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
How about a new Lost Vikings?

451
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Well, I mean, to be fair, Tigerclaw,

452
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I think the Warcraft III remaster is kind of where they're headed.

453
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I mean, Blizzard has a classics game division at this point,

454
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and I don't think this will be the last remaster.

455
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I really truly believe one of the other projects they're working on right now

456
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
is a Diablo remaster,

457
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
because they said they had multiple Diablo products in development.

458
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
One of them is Diablo IV, duh.

459
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
One of them is a Diablo remaster.

460
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It's just a question, is it Diablo I or Diablo II?

461
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Probably Diablo II, but we'll see, I suppose.

462
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Well, that's why they did Warcraft III and not Warcraft I or II.

463
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
DungeonBuster, with my analogy there,

464
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
saying Bethesda did that totally right.

465
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Let's see, BobbyBlackWolf says,

466
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Maybe Blizzard should have learned from the massive boycott

467
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
they got over having colors in Diablo III.

468
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I don't remember, I mean, that was a crippling boycott.

469
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I think whole tens of people didn't buy it.

470
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I do remember that one BlizzCon in particular,

471
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
the big announcement at the very end

472
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
was that the Demon Hunter is coming to Diablo III.

473
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That was the final announcement at one of the BlizzCons.

474
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So, I don't know.

475
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Like, maybe they need to reapproach the expectations

476
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
they're setting for BlizzCon?

477
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I don't know.

478
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I feel like the one year I went to BlizzCon,

479
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
do you know what the tentpole announcement was?

480
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Overwatch, okay?

481
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That was the best year to go to BlizzCon, honestly,

482
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
as far as press conferences and unveilings go,

483
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
because not only was it this brand new Blizzard property

484
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and everybody was fucking psyched about it,

485
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
but they had that whole Pixar quality movie trailer thing

486
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
that kicked it off.

487
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That was a beautiful year.

488
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
That was a beautiful thing to see in person.

489
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's interesting how high and low

490
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
the various BlizzCons can go.

491
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Alright.

492
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Bobby Blackwool says,

493
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Rob has the shirt with the rainbows and unicorns

494
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
around the Diablo III logo.

495
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't, actually.

496
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I want that shirt, but I don't have it.

497
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I did.

498
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh, no you don't.

499
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
No, I have a similar one that says,

500
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'm dead inside, with the unicorns and the rainbows

501
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and all that stuff.

502
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It just says I'm dead inside.

503
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I've worn that to host Rocky Horror before,

504
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
but I do not have a Diablo III.

505
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And it was my icon on the VoG forums was that thing,

506
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
when we had those,

507
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
but I actually never did get that shirt,

508
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
although I wanted it.

509
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Oh, and Bobby's reminding me it was a huge boycott

510
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
because there were colors in Diablo III

511
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and it wasn't drab and dark like Diablo should be.

512
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Well, here's the thing, guys,

513
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and maybe we'll kind of end on this note

514
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and then we can move on with the show,

515
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
is that I don't, like, here's the thing,

516
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
like, with all the hate and stuff

517
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
that Blizzard's getting right now,

518
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I feel like Blizzard is a little more open to feedback

519
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
than a lot of other companies.

520
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I feel like Blizzard is really gonna go back to their,

521
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
like, Blizzard's not stupid, you guys.

522
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Blizzard's gonna go back Monday morning

523
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and they're gonna really ask themselves,

524
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
what the fuck happened?

525
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That's, I can just imagine right now,

526
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
they're all getting in a room.

527
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
There goes Jay Allen, the guy running it,

528
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Wyatt, the Diablo guy,

529
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
all the guys, the big guys you saw at BlizzCon,

530
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
they're all gonna be sitting around a room

531
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Monday morning, shut the door, thank you.

532
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Okay, what the fuck happened?

533
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That's gonna be a conversation

534
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
8.30 a.m. at Blizzard headquarters tomorrow morning.

535
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So, they're gonna really try to reevaluate

536
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and work on some of that messaging,

537
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
but I just think, I think it was a bad idea

538
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
to not immediately remind people

539
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
there are many Diablo products in development

540
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
and this is one of them.

541
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I know Blizzard tried to put out a letter online

542
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
to reduce some of those expectations.

543
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That wasn't, clearly it wasn't enough.

544
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
They needed to reiterate it on stage.

545
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
What is their fear about saying the words

546
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Diablo 4 on stage?

547
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Are they worried that they might ultimately

548
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
cancel it or something?

549
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Like, how is Blizzard not going to make a Diablo 4,

550
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
eventually?

551
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
This is, I don't know, very strange.

552
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But anyway, I do think Blizzard

553
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
is gonna hear some of this feedback

554
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and I think we may end up seeing,

555
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I think there's a very strong possibility

556
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
this thing does not stay exclusive to mobile

557
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
because we know that mobile-type games like,

558
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
oh fuck, I don't know, Jetpack Joyride and stuff

559
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
will come out on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

560
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
So, maybe the ultimate thing that happens with this

561
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
is that Diablo Immortal ends up on consoles as well.

562
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I think there's a very distinct, and maybe even PC.

563
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I think there's a very distinct possibility that happens.

564
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm not gonna say that it's not gonna be filled

565
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
with microtransactions and all that stuff all of a sudden,

566
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
but I'm just saying that it's a very unique possibility

567
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
that they end up not making this mobile exclusive.

568
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I don't know.

569
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But their third-party partnership,

570
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I think that's what makes it a little bit trickier

571
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
because I'm not sure their third-party partner

572
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
develops for those type of things.

573
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So, I don't know.

574
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Anyway, Tigerclaw points out Hearthstone was a mobile game,

575
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
then got ported to consoles.

576
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I actually, you're kind of a little wrong.

577
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You think it was a mobile game.

578
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Originally, it was an iPad and PC release, or tablet.

579
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
The mobile came later because they had to condense

580
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
the interface down for mobile.

581
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It was actually originally for tablets

582
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
when people were talking more about iPads

583
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
and that sort of thing more often, which, for whatever reason,

584
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
we don't really talk about tablet PCs and Macs

585
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
as much as we used to, which is interesting.

586
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But I do seem to remember the original release of that

587
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
was on tablets and PC.

588
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Let's see.

589
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Dark Tetsuya says,

590
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I don't know what I heard on the YouTube trailers.

591
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Comments are getting deleted.

592
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
They even re-uploaded one of the trailers

593
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
to try and stave off the downvotes,

594
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
but I don't believe it worked out.

595
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Well, of course it didn't work out.

596
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
We all know Streisand Effect,

597
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and that whole thing is in full effect.

598
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You cannot remove that type of negativity from the internet,

599
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and I don't know who they're kidding.

600
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But Blizzard probably handles PR companies to do a lot of this,

601
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
and it's probably what the PR company's trying to do to save face.

602
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I don't freaking know.

603
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But all I know is that I would expect within a month,

604
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
probably less,

605
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Blizzard's going to have a big something to say about this.

606
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And honestly, a lot of it's probably just going to be a reiteration

607
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
of the letter they already wrote.

608
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
This is one of many Diablo products in the works.

609
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So please look forward to it, I suppose.

610
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
All right.

611
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Anyway, Rama in chat says,

612
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Diablo Mobile will end up on Switch, 3DS, and Vita.

613
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Oh, Rama, nothing's coming out for the Vita.

614
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I was going to say, what's a Vita?

615
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Nothing's going to come out for the Vita anymore.

616
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
In Japan, maybe. I don't know.

617
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I think they've killed the support there, too.

618
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Not really, because we still see releases on the Vita calendar.

619
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Sony's official.

620
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Yeah, Sony's official.

621
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Hey, as long as people are buying the games, they'll make them.

622
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
But yeah, I think it's going to start scaling way back in Japan pretty soon.

623
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I think that's going to be about the end of it.

624
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Rama reminds me that's the joke. Yes, I know, I know.

625
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
All right, let's get into our gaming weeks.

626
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And then I'm going to invite a special guest on the show

627
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
to talk about his gaming week.

628
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So, Loki, why don't you talk to us a little bit about your gaming week.

629
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
How was your gaming week?

630
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Well, I did some streaming on Twitch of DDR Extreme.

631
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I originally had planned on upgrading my machine,

632
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
well, maybe downgrading my machine to a fourth plus.

633
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
However, the CD drive that I got, while it is good for, actually,

634
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,000
the DVD drive that I have is good enough to run the games that I have,

635
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
it's not good enough to run the Super Disk,

636
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
so I have a new drive coming in its place.

637
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
But at least I was able to replace that without breaking anything,

638
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
and I got to take apart the 573 board and stuff like that.

639
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So that'll be coming probably in a couple weeks.

640
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I think they said deliver in the 19th, so about two weeks away.

641
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And then I did get to play a little bit more Red Dead Redemption 2.

642
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I still don't really know what the hell to do in that game.

643
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I think I'm just probably going to go through the story.

644
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I kind of want to get all the achievements and stuff

645
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
and then just cheat like crazy through it,

646
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
because that's where the fun is.

647
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But I haven't quite gotten there yet.

648
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But it's a very fun game still.

649
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And then I did finally dust off my VR headset to play some VR games.

650
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I did get enough time to play Tetris Effect, both in VR and in 4K.

651
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So the 4K, you know, it looked good.

652
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I prefer it in VR.

653
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
For me, it was easier to see the screen and just be able to,

654
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
even with the zoom function that they have in Tetris Effect,

655
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
it was just easier to see what I was doing.

656
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And it was easier to appreciate some of the stuff that was going on around it.

657
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It was kind of hard to notice some of the background changes and stuff in the 4K version,

658
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
which is weird, but I don't know.

659
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I guess it was kind of meant for VR in the first place, so I'm down with that.

660
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But with that being said, I still don't like the fact,

661
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and I know Bobby can probably relate to this,

662
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:29,000
the stupid drifting thing where the screen will drift slightly to the left all the time.

663
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And I get it that I can put my headset on the floor for a little bit,

664
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and it's supposed to solve that problem.

665
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And usually you can just reset your...

666
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Yeah, Bobby was talking about that the Tetris Effect didn't have re-centering.

667
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Exactly.

668
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Well, now, to be fair, this could be a demo versus retail thing.

669
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Right, right. I understand that.

670
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
But typically, even in demos for that stuff they have where you can re-center,

671
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
but I couldn't re-center it this way.

672
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So I ended up having to turn almost 45 degrees to the left to see the screen,

673
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
and it was ridiculous.

674
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And at this point in time, the PlayStation VR has been out for what?

675
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Like a year or two now?

676
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah, it's coming up on two years.

677
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Why haven't they fixed this? Why?

678
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Why haven't they fixed this yet?

679
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
This is ridiculous that this is still an issue this late in the game.

680
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Fix your shit.

681
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Why is this still a problem?

682
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I know we're not the only ones having this problem.

683
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Why can't this be fixed?

684
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Or, hey, occasionally just have it drift to the right to offset, you know,

685
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
the fucking drifting to the left.

686
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I don't understand why they can't just fix that shit.

687
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So, yeah, that was my only gripe there, but it's a great game.

688
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I look forward to the full version when I get that unlocked, I think, on Friday.

689
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yeah, it's really soon, right?

690
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Not this week, but next, right?

691
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
No, it's this week.

692
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Oh, shoot. Nice. Okay, cool.

693
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Is that it for your gaming week?

694
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
That's it.

695
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
My gaming week?

696
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Oh, at Pokemon Go.

697
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I'm sorry, and I wanted to say I like the adventure sync thing,

698
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
because that's pretty cool.

699
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I finally got the Fitbit thing to work, too,

700
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
and what's great is the Google Fit thing, it does not calculate steps very well.

701
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It over calculates the steps, but that works in my favor when it comes to...

702
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Well, and then it works in Niantic's favor, too,

703
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
because you're buying more incubators.

704
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
No, not really.

705
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Well, I don't have to buy it. I never am buying Pokeballs now,

706
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
but all of a sudden when that kicked in, it's like,

707
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
oh, here, here's 30 Pokeballs.

708
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm like, cool, I guess.

709
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Nice.

710
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Well, if that's it for you, then my gaming week...

711
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
All right, I'll start with Pokemon Go as well,

712
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
because you know nobody plays mobile games,

713
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
but I participated in the Gengar raid day on Saturday,

714
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
and I was very lucky this time.

715
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
My very first Gengar raid was shiny,

716
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
so I was like, cool, this never happens to me.

717
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
There's been some shiny days. I didn't get any on the Articuno day.

718
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I didn't get any, so it was nice to just kind of have that out of the way.

719
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I couldn't even tell it was shiny, because the difference is so subtle.

720
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
The only way I knew was the little special icon, and I was like...

721
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah, that's like...

722
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And I also exclaimed loudly, I'm like, is this...

723
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Because it did the little star thing when it showed up.

724
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I was like, is this a shiny?

725
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And then, of course, three people next to me were like, huh?

726
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And looked at my phone, and one of my buddies tasked me,

727
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
yeah, it's a shiny, it's shiny.

728
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And I was like, oh, shit, wow, cool.

729
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I finally won the shiny lottery for a change.

730
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So that was kind of nice.

731
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So I did that. I did the Gengar day.

732
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And then, of course, I stuck with it.

733
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Alan ended up getting a shiny, too,

734
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
and we raid over in the business district not far from here in the next town over,

735
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and then we kind of go throughout all those businesses and do all the gyms there.

736
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So we kind of walk a big route that's maybe like 10 or 11.

737
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I mean, we probably could do more gyms,

738
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
but most people want to stop after like 10

739
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
because they've burned their five free raid passes

740
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
and whatever maybe they had left over in their inventory.

741
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I think I still have like 25 extra raid passes

742
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
because of all the boxes I bought for incubators.

743
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So I'm more than happy to burn, burn, burn raid passes.

744
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But anyway, I got my one shiny, so I'm happy there.

745
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Other stuff, I've also played the Tetris Effect demo,

746
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
and I loved it. I really, really loved it.

747
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I did a stream when I played it for the very first time.

748
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So a cheap plug for my Twitch channel over at Rob Roberts.

749
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I played that on Twitch, and yeah, I just love it so far.

750
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I mean, I know it's just a demo, so I can't really give you my full thoughts,

751
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
but I'm really anxious to play more.

752
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Like, I just, the immersion, the beauty of those,

753
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
even the three skins that were available.

754
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Like, you know, obviously everybody loved that trailer song,

755
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
which is the first skin.

756
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
The second skin had a great song,

757
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
and it was interesting enough where the design of that

758
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
really kind of messes with your head.

759
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
How, like, the little lines in the block kind of go back and forth,

760
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
and they change colors.

761
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I don't know about you, but that was really messing with me when I was playing.

762
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
So it was kind of neat.

763
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And then that third stage with, you know, the fire and the drum beats

764
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
and the kakak and all that stuff,

765
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and the stage would actually change,

766
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and then as you're going, more and more people show up

767
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
to bow down to the Tetris thing and all that.

768
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It was just really cool. It's just so well done.

769
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It really is luminous meets Tetris, and that's fine.

770
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
That's what I wanted. That's great. Perfect.

771
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

772
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So, yeah, this is, so far I'm really loving it,

773
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
and I'm really excited for the retail release.

774
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I unboxed the VR this week with the intention of playing the demo on VR,

775
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
but then ended up going to a movie and I just didn't get around to it.

776
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But to be fair, I also have an unopened copy of Diablo 3 for Switch,

777
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
also waiting for me to go play.

778
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So Tetris Effect in VR is not the only thing that I've been neglecting.

779
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But I forgot how many parts there are for that PlayStation VR.

780
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
They have to, like, number everything.

781
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It's not that many.

782
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It seems, it's a lot.

783
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
It's not.

784
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It's like leg bones connected to the ankle bone.

785
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The ankle bone's putting together the PlayStation VR.

786
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Let's see, what else?

787
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I've still been playing World of Warcraft,

788
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
working on my alliance character that I boosted is now up to 116,

789
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
my Affliction Warlock, so still enjoying that,

790
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and been playing that a bit.

791
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And I guess, I guess that's really it for me to say.

792
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundromaty

793
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
with vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, icon.

794
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Yeah, that's it for my gaming week.

795
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

796
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
S2100 Matt says, Shiny Gengar was so lame.

797
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
We're shiny.

798
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's Gengar with a gray Instagram filter.

799
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Bobby Black Wolf says, Rob is talking about how much fun he's having,

800
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
and all I'm hearing is dead game, dead game, dead game, whatever.

801
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
How much money did he make last month?

802
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

803
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Anyway, we're going to break form a little bit here,

804
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and we're going to invite a friend of ours to come on the show here

805
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
for a little bit to talk about his gaming week,

806
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
because I know there's a very kind of unique game,

807
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
new game that came out,

808
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
and I know our friend has some strong opinions on this,

809
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
and the more I was hearing about this game,

810
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I was like, what in the hell is this?

811
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And I want to talk about it.

812
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So welcome to the show.

813
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
You know him from such shows as Ranger Pride.

814
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Welcome back, Shane, to the network.

815
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Hello.

816
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Hey, Shane, how you doing?

817
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I am fine.

818
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's good to hear from you.

819
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
What have you been up to lately?

820
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I know your shows have been on a little bit of a hiatus,

821
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
but everything going on for you?

822
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Well, I quit my show, so it didn't matter about what kind of hiatus it's on anymore.

823
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Well, I bet your fans are very sad to hear that,

824
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
but you've got a lot of other stuff going on, right?

825
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
No, but that's okay.

826
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
All right.

827
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
You've got things going on like playing games, right?

828
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
How is your gaming week?

829
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Oh, yeah, I'm up to nine shiny pincers right now in Pokémon GO.

830
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You're up to nine shiny pincers?

831
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yes.

832
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Wait.

833
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I want to do more.

834
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Everyone brace yourselves.

835
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I'm going to piss Shane off.

836
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Ready?

837
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
No, I already know.

838
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I saw your Twitter post.

839
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
How many shiny Gengars did you get?

840
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Zero.

841
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Sorry.

842
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Okay, the one time you don't get a shiny, Shane, let me have my moment.

843
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I guess you could just trade one to him.

844
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I don't have two of them.

845
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I only got one.

846
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Oh, okay.

847
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Well, you should still trade it to me.

848
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I don't think so.

849
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
But I got my one shiny pincer, so I'm happy.

850
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
But anyway, we've been criticized about talking about Pokémon GO too much on this podcast,

851
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
so I want to talk about a different game.

852
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Pokémon GO is amazing, even if it's a crappy game like GO.

853
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Well, then let's bring back PokéStop Podcast.

854
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
What do you say?

855
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Potentially I could be down.

856
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
All right.

857
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
To be continued.

858
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
All right.

859
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
But anyway, you want to talk about a different game this week, right?

860
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Well, you wanted me to talk about it, but I am more than happy to talk about it.

861
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Okay.

862
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
That's what I thought.

863
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
That's what I thought.

864
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So tell us about this game.

865
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
How is your game?

866
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
What have you been playing?

867
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I decided I'm a masochist, and I purchased The Quiet Man.

868
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The Quiet Man.

869
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I've never...

870
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Is that The Wicker Man?

871
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
A Quiet Place?

872
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I don't know what that means.

873
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
What is this game?

874
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It doesn't make sense to me.

875
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
It's a game...

876
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I don't remember who makes it.

877
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It's a fairly well-known developer, but it's published by Square Enix.

878
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It came out of nowhere, I believe it was at E3, and it was just this weird-looking game

879
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
that had live-action video mixed in with regular PS4 graphics.

880
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It looked like it beat them up.

881
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Nobody knew what was going on, and people were intrigued and scared.

882
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Mixing full motion video with games, isn't that something they did back when CD-ROM technology

883
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
was first out, like Phantasmagoria?

884
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Is that basically what this is?

885
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
No, it's like...

886
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
You remember...

887
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
What's the game that's on Xbox?

888
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Night Trap?

889
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
No, not Night Trap.

890
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Alright, next time you're gonna tell a joke, have it ready to go.

891
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It wasn't a joke, I was just referring...

892
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It is a game I didn't play, but you liked it because it was half TV series, half...

893
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Alan Wake.

894
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Alan Wake.

895
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
No, this is nothing like that at all.

896
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
No, it's the other one.

897
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Not Alan Wake.

898
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
The other game they did.

899
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Remedy.

900
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Quantum Break?

901
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
What?

902
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Quantum Break?

903
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Yes, Quantum Break.

904
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Quantum Break, yes.

905
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Thank you.

906
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
No, this again, nothing like that, because that was an amazing game.

907
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
No, I'm just saying that they're similar with the live-action and gameplay.

908
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
This game is crap.

909
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I don't even know if I would say it's similar in that vein.

910
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Let Shane talk.

911
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Wow, you'll never hear Rob say that again.

912
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
That's true.

913
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Enjoy this moment while it lasts.

914
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Okay, so PlayStation Network had it on sale for a couple dollars cheaper, and I was like,

915
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
what the heck?

916
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I'm kind of intrigued by this game, because I like games that are bad, but they're so

917
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
bad that they're good.

918
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
One of my all-time favorite games, Rising Xan.

919
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
That is a terrible game, but it is funny, it's not really that terrible to play, and

920
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
it's just one of my favorites.

921
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
This game is probably the worst game I've ever played in my life.

922
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Why?

923
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
This game is worse than Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival, and that's not even a game, because

924
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
a little two-year-old can beat you at that game, in quote marks, because you don't do

925
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
anything.

926
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Is it worse than Superman 64?

927
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Yes, I'd rather play that.

928
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Let me explain.

929
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So the premise of this game, from what I can tell, is that you are this guy who happens

930
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,000
to be deaf, and you beat up people for the first half of the game.

931
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Okay, this game is really racist, too, I think, because you don't get a lot of information

932
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
as to what's going on, because you're deaf, and the developers decided, well, then there

933
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
should be no audio in the game.

934
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
So you're playing the game, people are talking, it's not subtitled, I don't read lips, I'm

935
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
just guessing what's going on half the time.

936
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It's an interesting artistic decision.

937
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It's a premise that could work.

938
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Yeah, I'm all for having a deaf protagonist.

939
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Yeah, that's cool.

940
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah, it's an interesting twist, yeah.

941
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah, so the first half of the game, I'm beating up Hispanic gang members.

942
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
That's all I do.

943
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
There's four different models, four or five, and you just repeatedly beat them up.

944
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And you have a couple techniques or buttons you can hit for different attacks.

945
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The game doesn't tell you what each thing does, except in a little neon light picture.

946
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Like, you can go to the controller select screen, or the control screen, rather, and

947
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:34,000
you'll hit square, and it'll show this neon sign of your guy punching, and then triangles

948
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
is the neon sign of your guy kicking.

949
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
No words or anything to really tell you what's going on, so some of the controls I still

950
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
don't understand, because I don't read neon light signs.

951
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
All those years of BeatMania 2DX and you don't read neon light signs?

952
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
No, no I don't.

953
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Okay.

954
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So, oh god, just where'd it go with this?

955
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:03,000
You beat those five same characters up in very generic places constantly, and it's

956
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,000
spliced in between some of the action sequences are flashbacks.

957
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And your mom gets shot and killed by one of the gang members.

958
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Well that's not very nice.

959
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So you think, you guys aren't going to play, I don't care, I'm going to spoil everything.

960
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
This is a terrible game.

961
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
The gang members had nothing to do with it.

962
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So when you're fighting, after you have that first flashback, occasionally, when you kill

963
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
an enemy, the screen slows down.

964
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
You still see your terribly animated character and the terribly animated enemies.

965
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And then in the background, they try to overlay images, like these flashbacks are real people,

966
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
like real footage stuff.

967
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
They overlay that over the game screen.

968
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:59,000
So it's really jarring to see these poorly animated computer modeled characters fight

969
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:07,000
while really badly acted FMV is going on in the background of the apartment you're in.

970
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It's really, really bad.

971
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I mean, this question should be asked though, Shane.

972
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And you probably won't understand this, but humor me, okay?

973
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Is it like The Room bad?

974
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I don't know what that is.

975
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
You know the movie The Room that's so bad that people, okay, or Showgirls bad?

976
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I've never seen that on camera.

977
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's a movie that's so bad that it's actually kind of good when everybody sits around and

978
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
makes fun of it.

979
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
So here's what's fun about this game too, is there's like long cut scenes with people

980
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
talking that you can't understand it and there's no subtitles.

981
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
So you're watching two minutes of someone.

982
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
That's what really threw me the first time.

983
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Now, I thought I heard something about that they were going to patch in audio or something

984
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
like that.

985
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Like there's a patch coming from-

986
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Who cares?

987
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It's not going to make the game good.

988
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
The gameplay, you can hit the square button over and over and that's all you really need

989
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
to do for the most part to get through any area.

990
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Because your character will kind of just randomly teleport somewhere to another enemy.

991
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It's not even like there's a movement of your character.

992
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
He literally teleports right next to them.

993
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Yeah, and like Loki was saying, the first time after you do the intro, you talk with

994
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
your friend.

995
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Spoiler, he's the one that killed your mom so he's not your friend.

996
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Oh my God, Shane.

997
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
You just like ruined the whole game.

998
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It doesn't matter.

999
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Nobody should play this game.

1000
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I'm trying to make sure they don't.

1001
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Like, it's a six or seven minute full cut scene of these actors talking and signing

1002
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,000
with no sound, no subtitles, and you're just sitting there watching and making up your

1003
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
own story at that point because it's way more interesting than what's going on.

1004
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Or if you're like my boyfriend, you kind of fall asleep during it because it's really

1005
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
boring.

1006
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Or the best part where they just purposefully make it so that you don't understand the story.

1007
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,000
There's one part where the protagonist is looking at a ransom note, but you're looking

1008
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
at the ransom note from a camera angle behind his head so you can't see what's on the ransom

1009
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
note because even though he's deaf, it doesn't mean that you can't read the ransom note to

1010
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
be able to gain the knowledge of whatever it is that he's seeing.

1011
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
They purposely make it so that it's impossible to follow the story.

1012
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
One of my favorite parts though is shortly after that, you're talking to your friend

1013
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
who's the bad guy.

1014
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Remember that everybody, so you don't play this.

1015
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Wasn't there like some cop guy or something that was also bad?

1016
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
This is where it gets racist for that.

1017
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
We'll get to that in a second.

1018
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:49,000
But your friend is talking to you with his, like he's got his back turned to your character

1019
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and he says something to your character with his back turned to your character who is deaf

1020
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
and your character responds by talking.

1021
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Is there going to be a twist maybe when they put in the dialogue that this whole thing

1022
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
was this weird avant-garde art thing and that it actually makes a lot of sense when you

1023
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
actually get dialogue later?

1024
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
No, I don't think so.

1025
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I don't even care.

1026
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
And that segues into my next point.

1027
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So first of all, super racist, the first half of the game you beat up on Hispanic guys,

1028
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:28,000
the second half you beat up on black guys, and then your hero is this white cop.

1029
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I'm like, okay, this is hilarious.

1030
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Oh, you're trying to save a white woman too.

1031
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
And you're like the most generic white guy ever.

1032
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It's so annoying.

1033
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So for every like avant-garde artistic decision, there's some pretty, pardon the pun,

1034
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
tone deaf ones too.

1035
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And then for no reason, he turns into a magical bird man at the end.

1036
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yes.

1037
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Okay.

1038
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Yes.

1039
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So that was the only okay part of the entire game when I got to that point because my homework

1040
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
for this call was to beat the game and I did not succeed.

1041
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And I'll tell you why.

1042
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
So I got to that point.

1043
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It was kind of fun.

1044
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Like you were overpowered.

1045
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
It was some neat little attacks that lasted like for five minutes.

1046
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
It got really boring really quick.

1047
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And then you have to go beat up on your friend again.

1048
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And I did that.

1049
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
And once I beat up on him, I think something failed to trigger like a cut scene or something

1050
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
and I couldn't progress.

1051
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I had to turn off my game, started back over.

1052
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
It put me about 40 minutes back and I said, I'm done.

1053
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
This game is so bad.

1054
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I just don't care anymore.

1055
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I'm going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1056
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
MXC is apparently following the saga and says, yes, there will be sound,

1057
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
but when they add it as a patch in a week.

1058
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I thought that was a thing.

1059
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So you got to play it again when they do audio?

1060
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Nope.

1061
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, and it's disappointing to hear how terrible this is.

1062
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I mean, how often do you hear about a new IP?

1063
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Well, this is a new IP that costs $15, right?

1064
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Like, yeah, I got for like 13 because it was on sale.

1065
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
So clearly they knew something was wrong.

1066
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Okay.

1067
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I liken this to back at my Konami days when we were working on a poker game,

1068
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
like seven years after the poker fad had ended.

1069
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And everybody thought it was a bad idea.

1070
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
They pumped all this money into it.

1071
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
They put out trailers.

1072
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It was coming out for Xbox Live.

1073
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And they finally realized it was not like just cut your losses and run.

1074
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Don't put it out.

1075
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Somebody needed to tell Square Enix to do it to this game.

1076
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Do you think Blizzard needs to be told that about Diablo Immortal?

1077
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I don't care.

1078
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Like, I love the Switch one.

1079
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I'm having a blast with it.

1080
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
They can do whatever they want on mobile.

1081
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I'm not going to touch it, probably.

1082
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
That's interesting how you can have that perspective,

1083
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
where like mobile doesn't affect you.

1084
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And like a game that you don't want to play doesn't affect you,

1085
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
and that's okay.

1086
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Isn't that fascinating?

1087
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
If it was some integration to a game I like, Final Fantasy XIV,

1088
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
that was terribly done, Final Fantasy XIV, then yeah, I might be upset.

1089
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
But this is a standalone game that has nothing to do with screwing up,

1090
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
you know, something I like, Final Fantasy XIV.

1091
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Other comments in chat.

1092
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
MXC wants to ask to both you and Loki,

1093
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
do you guys have anything to say about the fact that the protagonist is

1094
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
maybe in love with a woman who looks exactly like his dead mom?

1095
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Yeah.

1096
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
This game has so many issues.

1097
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I thought it was her at first.

1098
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I was like, why is my best friend who turns out to be the villain,

1099
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
like in all these pictures with my mom that got shot,

1100
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
and he's looking like he does now.

1101
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
And then later on, you know, because there's no subtitles,

1102
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
and nothing that I can hear to tell me what's really going on.

1103
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Then I put it together that she just looks like her,

1104
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
and it's not maybe actually her.

1105
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I don't know.

1106
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
The game is dumb.

1107
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
We don't know because you can't tell what's going on.

1108
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
But yeah, seriously.

1109
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
It's the actors in a different way.

1110
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
If you're somewhat interested,

1111
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
just to kind of know what we're talking about here,

1112
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
and the only reason I know any of this is because I watched the video

1113
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
that Jim Sterling did.

1114
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
He did a 20-minute video talking about this game and showing off the poor.

1115
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
There's no animation transitions, for one,

1116
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
which is another nice thing, too.

1117
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
So when you're punching someone, they're falling over.

1118
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
They just pop back up, and then they get punched again,

1119
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and they fall back down.

1120
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
They pop back up again.

1121
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
We need to punch them.

1122
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
The only way I know, I went and watched it on Twitch

1123
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
the minute Shane told me about how bad this game was.

1124
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I went, and there was people playing it for extra life.

1125
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I guess they were punishing themselves for donations

1126
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
by playing this game on their Twitch streams.

1127
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
One of my favorite things about the game

1128
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
is that your walking animation doesn't look terrible,

1129
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
because parts of this game look okay.

1130
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
It looks like an up-resed PS3 game, maybe.

1131
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
It seriously sounds like a CD-ROM game out of 1994.

1132
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It really does.

1133
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
But it plays like, I don't know, a Coleco game or something.

1134
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
But you walk into a wall or an object,

1135
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
and your character gets stopped in the motion that he was in

1136
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
as he was walking into that object.

1137
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It's not like he just stands still.

1138
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
He's literally stuck in that pose until you move.

1139
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I just don't know what this game is

1140
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
besides a waste of maybe $15.

1141
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Well, Shane, I appreciate you coming on the show

1142
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
to spoil the game to make sure nobody will ever play it.

1143
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
That was very kind of you.

1144
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Nobody should play it.

1145
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Don't waste your money.

1146
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
If you want to give somebody a bad present, that's it.

1147
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
But do you really want to risk your friendship?

1148
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Since you brought up Konami in your years there,

1149
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
which game was worse, A Quiet Man or The Winx?

1150
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Oh, A Quiet Man. The Winx was awesome.

1151
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
What are you talking about?

1152
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I enjoyed my time with that game.

1153
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
There is nothing enjoyable about this game whatsoever.

1154
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
We can talk about all that now, right?

1155
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
That you were a tester on The Winx and all that stuff?

1156
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Yeah, when I was in between DVRs and stuff, yeah.

1157
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I was on The Winx, and it was fun.

1158
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
It was such a better game than this.

1159
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
There are so many games I used to think I hated,

1160
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
and now I would welcome them with open arms.

1161
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I remember I went to Blockbuster and rented Morrowind,

1162
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
and I thought it was so bad I took it back

1163
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
and rented Unlimited Saga, and that was bad too.

1164
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I thought that was the worst it could possibly get.

1165
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
And then I played The Quiet Man, and it's just...

1166
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I wish this wasn't one of the first notable death protagonists,

1167
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
if maybe the first notable one,

1168
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
because it's just a bad thing to be attached to, I feel like.

1169
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Shane, let's quickly...

1170
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I got to get back to the show because we do have news to get to,

1171
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
but I thought since you did spend 15-plus minutes talking about a bad game,

1172
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I would maybe give you 60 seconds to talk about Tetris Effect, a good game?

1173
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Oh, it's so good.

1174
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I've played the demo so many times.

1175
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I meant to play just the first three stages the night it released,

1176
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
and I played it for like an hour and a half instead,

1177
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
and it was still just the same first three stages.

1178
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
You know what was weird, though, is I'm not 100% sold on the VR mode.

1179
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I played it, and it didn't really grab me as much as I thought it would.

1180
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Interesting.

1181
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So now we're two for three on VR,

1182
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
because Loki and Bobby preferred the VR.

1183
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
You don't.

1184
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
No.

1185
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Maybe if I had a headset on, too, that might have helped,

1186
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
but I was just using a soundbar and my VR headset,

1187
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
and I definitely preferred playing it regular to that.

1188
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Interesting, because the common theme I kind of heard with Loki and Bobby

1189
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
was that it was the immersion and the fact that it kind of took you out

1190
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
of the rest of your room.

1191
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
That was the big thing for it.

1192
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
So maybe...

1193
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Oh, maybe I was just too focused on the game

1194
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
that it didn't really change my perspective.

1195
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Bobby does say, I had headphones on with a headset.

1196
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
What about you, Loki?

1197
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I had headphones.

1198
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Maybe that's the trick.

1199
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
That's probably it.

1200
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
That's what I'll need to do when it comes out for real.

1201
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
But hey, if you get it at Best Buy, you have to wait an extra week,

1202
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
so it kind of sucks.

1203
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Uh-oh.

1204
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
All right.

1205
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Well, Shane, I guess we're going to have to invite you back on OLR

1206
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
in a couple weeks, because you and I are headed

1207
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
to Final Fantasy Fan Fest in a couple weeks.

1208
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Yeah, and maybe I will buckle down and beat the quiet man

1209
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
so you guys can all know exactly what I feel about it,

1210
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
because I haven't figured it out yet.

1211
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
All right.

1212
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Well, maybe you should wait a week for it to get this patch,

1213
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
apparently, that it's getting.

1214
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
No!

1215
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I have to play it in the original artistic intent.

1216
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
That's right.

1217
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
It's not called the loud man.

1218
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It's called the quiet man.

1219
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
It's not even necessarily a patch.

1220
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Like, they thought about it in the second hand.

1221
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
That's how the game ends.

1222
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
They're all like, you know, there's more secrets to be unlocked

1223
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
and it has a countdown to the patch.

1224
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Wow.

1225
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
All right.

1226
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Oh, this is so bad.

1227
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
All right, Shane.

1228
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I hope the secret it unlocks is a way to get your money back.

1229
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
All right, Shane.

1230
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Well, the chatters really enjoyed hearing from you.

1231
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
SJ100Matt says Shane needs to come back more often.

1232
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So don't be a stranger.

1233
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
We'll hear from you again soon, I hope.

1234
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
All right.

1235
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Bye.

1236
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Bye.

1237
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
All right.

1238
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Thanks, Shane.

1239
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
And I'm going to bug him.

1240
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Did you hear what he said about that Pokestop podcast thing?

1241
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Yeah.

1242
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I'm going to bug him about that.

1243
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
All right.

1244
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
One thing.

1245
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Oh, I didn't get into this with Shane.

1246
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I had it up in the background because this was important too.

1247
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Apparently, one of the big things about the quiet man

1248
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
is that a new song was written for it.

1249
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
So it actually has like an original song.

1250
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Hey, why would you waste the potential of that on this?

1251
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Such a terrible game.

1252
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Get this.

1253
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Do you know who that is doing the song?

1254
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It's Imogen Heap.

1255
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
One of my favorite.

1256
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Now, I know not everybody probably knows who Imogen Heap is,

1257
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
but she's like legit one of my favorite musicians like ever.

1258
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
She did a great.

1259
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
She did them.

1260
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Everybody knows that song, hide and seek,

1261
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
because that's where the dear sister.

1262
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
All that came from.

1263
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
What you say.

1264
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
That was Imogen Heap, right?

1265
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
And all that dear sister on Star Live and all those parodies.

1266
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
That was Imogen Heap.

1267
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
A lot of people know her band, Fru Fru,

1268
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
with Guy that did the Must Be Dreamin'.

1269
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
The one that was in the movie Garden State.

1270
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
So I think a lot of people probably have heard of Imogen Heap.

1271
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
But anyway, she did this song for the quiet.

1272
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And apparently, it's a waste of talent.

1273
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
That's really unfortunate.

1274
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I think that plays like at the ending credits or something like that.

1275
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So it's kind of like the Leona Lewis song of Final Fantasy 13.

1276
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
You don't hear it until the closing credits basically.

1277
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Interesting.

1278
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
All right.

1279
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Spoiler alert.

1280
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
But yeah, go watch the Jim Sterling video

1281
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
if you want to see what this game is all about.

1282
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And honestly, after watching it, no.

1283
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I didn't know what this game was, and I don't care.

1284
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I know we're going to get an email that's really pissed off

1285
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
about the spoilers that Shane dropped.

1286
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
But honestly, he did you a favor.

1287
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
It's a two hour long game.

1288
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
$15.

1289
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
All right.

1290
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
And most of it's cut scenes.

1291
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Let's get into some news.

1292
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I don't really have a lot of announcements

1293
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
except for the fact that we will not be here in two weeks

1294
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
because of the Final Fantasy Fan Fest I just mentioned.

1295
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Shane and myself and some of our other friends

1296
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
will be in Las Vegas.

1297
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Actually, that Sunday we will be driving back from Las Vegas,

1298
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
but that is a nine hour drive.

1299
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I don't expect to be back in time for OLR, sadly.

1300
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
So we're just going to not have it that night.

1301
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
All right.

1302
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
All right.

1303
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
So one thing we didn't mention during the whole BlizzCon thing

1304
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
is that Destiny 2 is now free

1305
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
if you have a Blizzard Battle.net account.

1306
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
So you can actually go in there on your profile

1307
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
and they have like gifts,

1308
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
and you can redeem the base game for free

1309
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
up until the 18th of November.

1310
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Again, talk about it.

1311
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I know I went off on this earlier,

1312
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
but talk about a missed messaging opportunity.

1313
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I can't believe they buried that in the pregame show

1314
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
and they didn't announce that.

1315
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Why didn't they announce that on stage?

1316
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Now, to be fair,

1317
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
maybe the problem is that Destiny is not a Blizzard game.

1318
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And so if the guy from Destiny had come up at BlizzCon,

1319
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
that might have had a really weird reception

1320
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
from the Blizzard fans

1321
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
because I know not all of them are really into Destiny 2.

1322
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
They know that the company is called Activision Blizzard, right?

1323
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I know, I know.

1324
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Just saying.

1325
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
But to be fair,

1326
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
like if the dude came out,

1327
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
we'd probably be all like,

1328
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
who the hell are you? Get off the stage.

1329
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
But if he's out to say,

1330
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
hi, I'm giving away my game for free,

1331
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I think everybody would be like,

1332
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
oh, okay, cheers and applause.

1333
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Cheers for the free game.

1334
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Cheers and applause.

1335
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Like, you know,

1336
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
they're not going to boo him off the stage for that.

1337
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
So I do kind of think that was a really,

1338
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
again, poor missed messaging opportunity on Blizzard's part,

1339
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
which is going to be a bit of a theme of BlizzCon 2018, I think.

1340
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
But if you have, I mean, hey, free game in Destiny 2.

1341
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Exactly, I'm not sure.

1342
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
It was also free on PlayStation 4,

1343
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
like was it August, I think?

1344
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
It was like a plus title.

1345
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Yeah, it was in August or September or something like that.

1346
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Because, spoiler alert, the expansions aren't free,

1347
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
and that's what they really want you to buy.

1348
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
But...

1349
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Joke's on them.

1350
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I'm not going to buy them.

1351
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
You can still get a pretty decent experience

1352
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
with the free game, and you know, why not?

1353
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
If you have a Battle.net account,

1354
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
which I imagine most of you do,

1355
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and you don't have to buy a Blizzard game to get one,

1356
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
because like you can play the WoW trial,

1357
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
the World of Warcraft trial.

1358
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Well, and Hearthstone is free, actually,

1359
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
now that I think about it.

1360
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
So you could just download it to play Hearthstone,

1361
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
and you're set.

1362
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
You can grab your free copy of Destiny 2,

1363
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
but only until November.

1364
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
The 18th.

1365
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
So again, about two weeks from tonight.

1366
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
So go get it.

1367
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Go do that.

1368
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Even if you're not sure if you want to play it,

1369
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
it's always good just to put it in your library.

1370
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
That's right.

1371
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
It's not free until November 18th

1372
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
when they're going to pull it off your account,

1373
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
but register it now.

1374
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It's free forever, basically,

1375
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
because the real trick is they want you to buy the expansions.

1376
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
That's why they're doing this.

1377
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Don't kid yourself.

1378
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Yeah, DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1379
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
once you get Destiny 2, please pick up Forsaken 2.

1380
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Yeah, exactly.

1381
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
vidpower points out you do need Blizzard SMS

1382
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
on your Battle.net account to get your free Destiny 2 game,

1383
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
so they do want you to have the two-factor authentication,

1384
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
which, I mean, say what you will about that

1385
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
and maybe giving Blizzard your phone number,

1386
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
but in this day and age, you guys,

1387
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I don't know about you,

1388
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I have two-factor authentication

1389
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
on everything that will let me.

1390
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Everything that will let me.

1391
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
It's just that kind of world that we live in

1392
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
when who's going to get hacked next?

1393
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
And especially after having my Xbox 360 account

1394
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
hacked some time ago,

1395
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I don't know, it was probably like 10 years ago at this point,

1396
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
but still, I don't want that shit to happen again.

1397
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
So you better believe I have two-factor authentication

1398
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
on everything.

1399
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And I think it's a good idea.

1400
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
And then even for my email,

1401
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I will put the two-factor authentication on myself and Alan.

1402
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
So even if I ever get locked out or I lose my phone,

1403
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
at least Alan can unlock the most important thing,

1404
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
that type of thing.

1405
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
So anyway, let's see.

1406
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Go into chat at live.vognetwork.com.

1407
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Bonds006 says,

1408
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Not ever going to buy any expansion.

1409
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Well, only the Warcraft 3 expansion, Frozen Throne.

1410
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
How do you feel, though,

1411
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
when the expansions are finally bundled in with the main game?

1412
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Because, for example, if you get Diablo 3 on Switch,

1413
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
people forget there was an expansion

1414
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
that really made that game a lot better.

1415
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I don't even remember the name of it now.

1416
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
It's just Diablo 3 as I know it.

1417
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I know they had Rise of the Necromancer,

1418
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
was what they called when they released the Necromancer,

1419
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
although it really wasn't an expansion.

1420
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But, yeah, they released all that,

1421
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
and now you just get it all in one.

1422
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
So it's not really an expansion,

1423
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
because it's the Ultimate Edition or whatever they call it.

1424
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Let's see.

1425
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
It's just Reaper of Souls. Thank you, Vidpower.

1426
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Bobby Blackwolf is saying,

1427
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
The Quiet Man is on Steam, which means you can refund it

1428
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
as long as you don't play it for longer than two hours.

1429
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Which is how long the game is.

1430
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And Shane says,

1431
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Why would you put yourself through even five minutes?

1432
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Did I make clear how terrible it was?

1433
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
If you want to put yourself through 20 minutes,

1434
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
like I say, I recommend you go watch Jim Sterling's video on it,

1435
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
because it sums up basically all of the key features

1436
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
of why you would not like this game.

1437
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I love that Shane is continuing his campaign of hate

1438
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
by joining the chat room to be like,

1439
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
He is just doing a public service

1440
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
of keeping people away from shitty games.

1441
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
There is no harm in that.

1442
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
And I understand that Square Enix is a company

1443
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
that I like as well, but you know what?

1444
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
When they make a crappy game that's not Chocobo Racing,

1445
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
then I'm going to call them out on that crap.

1446
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I love Chocobo Racing.

1447
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Exactly. They could have used the resources

1448
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
put towards this.

1449
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
We could have had a whole new Imogen Heat song

1450
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
for Chocobo Racing.

1451
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Crazy Chocobo by Imogen Heat.

1452
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
But no, instead we get the Quiet Man.

1453
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
It's a crime, I tell you.

1454
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I'm just imagining Imogen Heat singing a bunch of lyrics

1455
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
that go like, Work, work, work, quack, work, work, quack.

1456
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And it sadly makes sense.

1457
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
So them doing the whole, you know,

1458
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
just like the Chocobo theme,

1459
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
but with that auto-tune.

1460
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Yes. That. Exactly that.

1461
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
There was another big announcement this week

1462
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
around Super Smash Bros.

1463
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
That's right, there was a big direct,

1464
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Direct

1465
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
that happened earlier this week,

1466
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
and lots of things were unveiled.

1467
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
And the earlier rumors,

1468
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
remember that really convincing rumor,

1469
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
the Grinch rumor in that whole thing?

1470
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
No, that was not convincing. It's from 4chan.

1471
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Turned out to be fake.

1472
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Oh, what a fake rumor from 4chan?

1473
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
That is so unreal.

1474
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Anyway, the one part that was real

1475
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
was like the even odds bet part

1476
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
that Ken is going to be...

1477
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Oh, there's already a leaked screenshot of Ken.

1478
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Everybody knew Ken was coming, come on.

1479
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
They will be continuing to release new amiibo

1480
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
throughout 2019.

1481
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So with all these new characters

1482
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
that are coming to the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,

1483
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
there will be new amiibo,

1484
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
including Isabel, Pichu, Ken,

1485
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Young Link, Daisy,

1486
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
all of the new amiibo coming in through 2019.

1487
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Apparently there will be a snake amiibo at some point.

1488
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
King K. Rool and Ice Climbers

1489
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
are going to be out on February 15th, 2019.

1490
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Wolf and Ridley and Inkling

1491
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
will be the launch day amiibos.

1492
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
The question is, are they still patching it?

1493
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Well, I don't think they are in the Wii U anymore.

1494
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Are they patching in those new amiibos

1495
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
to work with Mario Maker?

1496
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I think Mario Maker is kind of done, Loki.

1497
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I hate to say it.

1498
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I kind of wish they would bring it back.

1499
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I'm surprised they have a remaster of that.

1500
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I wish they would bring it back for Switch,

1501
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
but maybe that will be a thing they do next year.

1502
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Anyway, no trophies.

1503
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
That whole trophy thing is going to be gone

1504
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
in Super Smash Ultimate.

1505
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
What they are doing instead,

1506
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
it is a spirit system.

1507
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Not everybody I think is feeling this,

1508
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
but that's what it is.

1509
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
You will be able to fill your player with spirits,

1510
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
like an augment.

1511
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
You can do primary and support spirits,

1512
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
but you will not have the characters.

1513
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
You will win them in spirit battles.

1514
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I guess the aura of characters

1515
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
that were not included in the game,

1516
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
like Astro Man from Mega Man 9

1517
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
and Chibi-Robo,

1518
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
you can also do these with multiplayer mode.

1519
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
For example, if you fight a giant Mega Man

1520
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
in the Guts Man stage,

1521
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
you might get the Guts Man spirit.

1522
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
That's something you can use to augment your character

1523
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
a little later on.

1524
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Because they've killed everyone.

1525
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Apparently, you can feed and upgrade.

1526
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
You level up, you do missions.

1527
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
One way I've heard this referred to negatively

1528
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
is it's kind of like a mobile phone.

1529
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
What do they call it?

1530
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Gotcha type of game.

1531
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Even though that might be a big deal in Japan,

1532
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
they're not nearly quite as popular here.

1533
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I don't think everybody is really excited about that.

1534
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Anyway, vidpower in chat says,

1535
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
poor Sakurai, he'll be working on Smash stuff forever.

1536
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
One of my favorite memes right now

1537
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
is that picture of Sakurai

1538
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
just looking dead-ass tired that says,

1539
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
he's never asked me for anything ever again.

1540
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Also, they announced that Piranha Plant

1541
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
will be the first DLC fighter.

1542
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
So Piranha Plant will be coming to the game.

1543
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
That is, I think, a free DLC character, actually.

1544
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
If you buy the game before January something.

1545
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Oh, that's right. You have to buy it before a certain day.

1546
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
So it's kind of like a launch window type of free thing

1547
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
that you can grab there.

1548
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
You can also get a Piranha Plant amiibo

1549
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
with all those other things I was talking about.

1550
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
People are very excited about this.

1551
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
The final Smash will be Petey Piranha.

1552
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
So that's from Mario Galaxy,

1553
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
is where that reference comes from.

1554
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So yay that they're still referencing that, I suppose.

1555
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And then, didn't they announce one more fighter too?

1556
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Oh yes, Incineroar was also announced

1557
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
as a playable fighter in the game.

1558
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Which, you know, another Pokemon fighter.

1559
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
But it's kind of like a wrestling Pokemon.

1560
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Incineroar really looks like a wrestler.

1561
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
So I guess there's a lot they can kind of do with that.

1562
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
So they can make it, you know.

1563
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Is Incineroar in the Pokemon fighting game?

1564
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
No, I don't believe so.

1565
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Because Incineroar, if I remember right,

1566
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
comes from Pokemon, the newest one.

1567
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Pokemon Sun and Moon.

1568
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Because he is Litten's final form.

1569
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
So he comes from the newest one.

1570
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I think Pokken is before Gen 7.

1571
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I think. Don't quote me.

1572
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I'm sure I'll get corrected in chat momentarily if I'm wrong.

1573
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Shane in chat says,

1574
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Piranha Plant is not a part of the five upcoming DLC fighters.

1575
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Which is good.

1576
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Oh, but Shane does point out.

1577
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
DeSuidae is in Pokken.

1578
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And that is Gen 7. So I was wrong on that.

1579
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
DeSuidae is Rowlet's final form.

1580
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
So I forgot about that. So fair enough.

1581
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Let's see.

1582
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
There's going to be a fighter's pass

1583
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
to support all these DLC characters.

1584
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
It comes not just with a DLC character, but there will be a stage

1585
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
and all that good stuff.

1586
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Yeah, so there will be a World of Light adventure mode.

1587
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Subspace Emissary is not coming back.

1588
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
But the World of Light adventure mode kind of looks fun.

1589
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Although obviously they're keeping a lot of it a secret.

1590
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Because they don't want people to ruin it all.

1591
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Apparently Kirby is going to play a big role in that.

1592
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Which I'm sure made Act Deft very happy to hear.

1593
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
So, lots of news coming out about Smash.

1594
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
What do you think? Where's your head at with Smash?

1595
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I mean, the reality is,

1596
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
the minute they announced they were doing a Smash Bros. for Switch,

1597
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I'm getting it. Why wouldn't I get it?

1598
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Like, it kind of doesn't matter what's announced and all this stuff.

1599
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I don't want to make it sound like I'm not hyped or anything like that.

1600
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
But I just, you know, I just think

1601
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
the game is going to be great. It's a Smash game.

1602
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
What are the chances you think Waluigi is going to be a DLC character?

1603
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Never say never.

1604
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
But I just, I don't know.

1605
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
It would be funny if it was the very last one they do.

1606
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
But I don't know, guys.

1607
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I think the internet, sometimes the internet shouldn't get everything at once.

1608
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Let's just leave it at that.

1609
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.

1610
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Kaijuto says,

1611
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
They better not make another Smash after this one.

1612
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
This is the ultimate. Just put it on every system here on out.

1613
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
S2100Matt says,

1614
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Sakurai is going to hide deep in the woods after this one.

1615
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
You know what? Honestly, after this,

1616
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Sakurai should be able to make whatever fucking game he wants.

1617
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
If he has like a pet project that, you know what?

1618
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
He should be able to make whatever fucking game he wants

1619
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
after doing this for Nintendo for so long.

1620
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
And as far as Smash Bros. goes,

1621
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
you can wait a little while for another one.

1622
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Or maybe it'll just get turned over to other people.

1623
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Not that I'm saying Sakurai really shouldn't stay a part of it,

1624
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
but if Sakurai wants to do some other stuff,

1625
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
fucking let him. Jesus.

1626
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
First off, let him take a nap.

1627
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
That's the first thing he should do,

1628
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
is get to take a nap.

1629
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Anyway, let's move on.

1630
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
We have plenty more news to get to. Loki.

1631
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
So there was a new Undertale type game that was released.

1632
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
So, Deltarune, which was a prequel to Undertale.

1633
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
And, or, I don't know if it was a prequel, a sequel,

1634
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
but it's related to Undertale.

1635
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And I guess they had this survey that went out, as well,

1636
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
that allowed you to actually download the game for free,

1637
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
if I remember correctly.

1638
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
So it's pretty cool.

1639
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
And then, I don't know.

1640
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,000
It's a neat looking game, but...

1641
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I still haven't played Undertale yet.

1642
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
But, I hear this one's pretty cool,

1643
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,000
and it has a lot of people wondering, you know,

1644
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
what the secrets are behind it.

1645
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
So mysterious.

1646
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Is this one of those things where, like,

1647
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
it's gonna be like an onion,

1648
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
where many layers start unveiling themselves,

1649
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
and how it ties into other stuff, and, I don't know,

1650
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
like a whole, like, Five Nights type story going on here?

1651
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Sort of, but, like, they have, what's kind of cool about it is,

1652
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
like, they have a similar combat system in the game,

1653
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
but you can actually have parties,

1654
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
instead of just, like, your single character.

1655
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I don't know.

1656
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
It looked pretty cool from the video that I saw, but...

1657
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Some comments from chat, over at live.vognetwork.com.

1658
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Rama says,

1659
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Deltarune is an anagram for Undertale.

1660
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
So, interesting. Fun fact.

1661
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
And then, Dark Tetsuya, I'm sorry,

1662
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
it's actually s200mata saying, Loki, play Undertale.

1663
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And stream it, also.

1664
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I have, I have it.

1665
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I just haven't played it yet.

1666
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
But I have it.

1667
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Story of my life.

1668
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
It's in my Steam collection.

1669
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Exactly. It's in my Steam library.

1670
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Just haven't gotten around to playing it yet.

1671
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Alright, well, something that's possibly going to be added to your Switch library soon is the YouTube app.

1672
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Lots of rumors that the YouTube app is finally going to happen on Nintendo Switch,

1673
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
so that could be interesting.

1674
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,000
This is due to the fact that the official Nintendo site put up a placeholder for YouTube on the Nintendo Switch.

1675
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
So, apparently, it will be coming to the system on the 8th of November.

1676
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Now, there hasn't been any confirmation from Nintendo or YouTube on this,

1677
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
but, I mean, why not, right?

1678
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
So, that would be this week.

1679
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Yeah.

1680
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Getting right into the holiday season.

1681
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Putting Netflix on it while they're at it.

1682
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I know, right?

1683
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
But, for whatever reason, that isn't on the agenda yet.

1684
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
But, YouTube, you know, like, you would use that, right?

1685
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Because your kids love YouTube, don't they?

1686
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Yeah, probably not necessarily on the, um, on the Switch,

1687
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
but, yeah, I mean, I would, I would see some use out of it.

1688
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Alright.

1689
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Well, let's move on.

1690
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.

1691
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,000
One other game that I should be excited about, but I, unfortunately, am not excited about.

1692
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
That's Fallout 76.

1693
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
So, Fallout 76, if you had pre-ordered it, you get the wonderful beta tests that you get to participate in.

1694
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
So, with that, um, there's been some hitches with the beta, after all.

1695
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:35,000
So, one of the first problems is there's a bug in the beta that actually re-downloads the beta.

1696
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
So, as you're, you know, trying to launch the game or whatever,

1697
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,000
um, it unfortunately causes the client to delete itself and re-download itself.

1698
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
All 50 gigs of it.

1699
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Sounds like, um, an issue you might have had, you know, but not necessarily with this game, but, like, similar to...

1700
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:56,000
When Quantum Break's patching thing on the Xbox One caused me to hit my Comcast data cap for the first time.

1701
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,000
But, yeah, the minute you said that, like, re-downloading 50 gigs, like, if that happens 20 times, you're at your cap.

1702
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I mean, honestly, since you've already, you've probably used three or four hundred, you know, megabytes in a month like I do, you got less than that.

1703
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Yeah, so, like, apparently there was an issue where, like, it would freeze up and then it would just force you to re-download the whole thing.

1704
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
So, that kind of sucks.

1705
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Um, but apparently, um, I guess they're working on maybe fixing it. I don't know.

1706
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Um, and then on top of that, a little bit more major bug, though, in actual gameplay and how the game is designed.

1707
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Apparently, people have found that the physics in the game are tied to the framerate that you're running the game at.

1708
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:44,000
So, for example, if you have a better system or you're, you know, find a way that you can run the game at a higher framerate,

1709
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:53,000
and you can actually unlock the framerate using a small edit to an .ini file, um, if you're able to run the game at a higher framerate,

1710
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:59,000
you will move faster than other players, or you will shoot faster than other players.

1711
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:06,000
So, for example, people have been looking at the ground a little bit to help, you know, cause the framerate to go up,

1712
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
and they're able to run faster than people, um, that are on lower spec computers.

1713
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Hmm.

1714
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
That is stupid. You should never do that.

1715
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Yeah, that sounds like a problem.

1716
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
That is, like, amateur hour bullshit.

1717
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:25,000
DungeonBuster in chat says, well, Bethesda did say to prepare for spectacular bugs with Fallout 76.

1718
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
It is a beta, right?

1719
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
You can't advertise that as a feature, Bethesda.

1720
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Bugs are not a feature.

1721
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I mean, some of them can be, like, quaint in, like, Skyrim stuff.

1722
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Seriously, that is, that is some broken shit right there.

1723
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Like, I don't know what modern game nowadays would even do that.

1724
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Like, you always check the, you know, like, for example, in Unity, you would use a delta time,

1725
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:59,000
so that you were always getting a consistent, um, clock tick on your, you know, physics calculations or whatever,

1726
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
because you're able to see, oh, this frame came sooner than this last frame.

1727
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It's always kind of, you know, giving you a multiplier to speed and slow down everything based on whatever delay there is in your framerate.

1728
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
But to just lock it to that framerate is dumb.

1729
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:21,000
That's why, like, in some of these older games, like, that are, I can't think of anything in particular,

1730
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,000
but there's, like, some older games, like, if you try to emulate them or you try to run them on a faster PC,

1731
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
it just fucks everything up, because, like, a game that was locked through a 30 FPS,

1732
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:36,000
well, the physics are all based on the 30 FPS, and so when you unlock at the 60, everything goes all fucked up.

1733
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And apparently this, from what I hear, was an issue tied to Gamebryo, which was, like, one of their engines that they were running back with Morrowind,

1734
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:50,000
but they incorporated some of that stuff into the creation engine when they were doing, you know, Skyrim and Fallout and all that stuff,

1735
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:56,000
and they just, I guess they kept dealing, I don't know why they would do that. It's just really dumb.

1736
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Is it something that seems like it'll be fixable before the main game releases, though?

1737
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I don't think they can fix it.

1738
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Oh, God. Interesting.

1739
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Interesting.

1740
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
I mean, it would be a major overhaul, I think.

1741
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
So, consoles are going to be the way to do it, because consoles, at least, are all kind of, like, the same baseline.

1742
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:19,000
They're going to be locked to, they would be able to lock the framerate, but PC, since you have that stuff exposed in an INI file, it's dumb.

1743
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Oh, boy.

1744
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, hey, let's attack this guy's camp. Other guy moves as fast as the flash and kills everyone.

1745
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Oh, never mind.

1746
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
That sounds a little game-breaking.

1747
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Like, it wouldn't be so bad if it was, like, a single-player game, but being that it's online multiplayer, eh, not great.

1748
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Well, if you want to play a single-player game that's only-

1749
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Oh, and I did want to mention, just in case there was any question, Bethesda says there were the issue, and it says a fix won't be out until the game launches.

1750
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
So, they're going to try to work it out before the game launches, I guess.

1751
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Yes.

1752
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Interesting.

1753
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
All right, well, if you do want to play a single-player only game, then one of those games you can play is Tetris Effect.

1754
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:08,000
That's right, because Tetris Effect will not have competitive multiplayer, which is something that many people, I think, associate with Tetris, especially thanks to things like Tetranet or the original Game Boy Tetris.

1755
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Yeah, but this is a little bit more chill, so I can kind of see how it would-

1756
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I think that's exactly why they did this.

1757
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:26,000
You know, Mizuguchi talks about how Tetris Effect is really kind of to get in the zone, which is why you have that zone mechanic, and it's really, you know, what they're doing is really all about that.

1758
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,000
And a representative from Enhanced Games kind of, you know, expanded on this, named Mark McDonald, saying,

1759
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
There's no direct head-to-head multiplayer because we don't want something that's going to stress people out.

1760
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
People would find a way to spell fuck you in Tetris pieces or something.

1761
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Well, he's not wrong.

1762
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I think it'd be easier for them to draw a dick.

1763
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Yeah, that's true. Anyway.

1764
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
We just want to make it into a positive thing where you see your friends playing well.

1765
01:23:50,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And so I guess they do like, you know, there's Learboards, asynchronous multiplayer, the whole, you know, they did that weekend ritual during the test this weekend where everybody was working towards a common goal, which they hit before I could even log into the game.

1766
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I mean, they hit it fast.

1767
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:10,000
But apparently, like, you know, you can do things where you're working together to meet a goal and maybe unlock a new avatar or something like that.

1768
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
So that's the type of stuff they want to do for multiplayer.

1769
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:22,000
But none of this, you know, versus stuff, which is interesting because if you played that mystery mode, which was kind of hidden in the demo.

1770
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:29,000
And by the time most of you hear this, if you're not live, you know, the Tetris Effect demo is probably already done because it was a weekend demo.

1771
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And once they pull it, they pull it.

1772
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
And even if you downloaded it, you can't play anymore.

1773
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,000
But with the demo, they had the mystery mode in it, and it had all these ways to fuck with your pieces.

1774
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Like, it wasn't just pushing it up. It was about, like, they would spin rows. You would have a giant piece.

1775
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
My favorite one was the one for a minute where you would get only three.

1776
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Like, instead of it four block pieces, you got three block pieces.

1777
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:01,000
And it was actually kind of like a reward, I think, because you could put them into some harder to reach places and help to clear your board a little bit from some of the other ways that it would fuck with you.

1778
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:10,000
And then the one that completely got me, and if you watch on stream, I know I had a hilarious reaction, was when all of a sudden the entire image flipped upside down.

1779
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
And you just have to play the game upside down.

1780
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,000
And it really, like, you know, left is right, right is left, and it just, like, completely fucks with you.

1781
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
So, you know, because you're in the zone, that was a little rough.

1782
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:25,000
So, I mean, it has kind of that same intensity that multiplayer would have a little bit, I think.

1783
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
But, you know, for whatever reason, they decided not to put it in the game.

1784
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
And it's fine. It really sounds like there's going to be a lot of stuff to enjoy in this game.

1785
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And I guess they're wanting to save something for the sequel, aren't they?

1786
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Sure.

1787
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Or maybe they don't want to step on the toes too hard with Puyo Puyo Tetris.

1788
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Because if you want, you can play a purely competitive Tetris.

1789
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,000
You don't even have to have the Puyo stuff in it. You can just play Tetris on the Puyo Puyo Tetris.

1790
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
So maybe that kind of went into it. I don't know.

1791
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
But anyway, that's actually not the only game that's not going to have multiplayer.

1792
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Sorta.

1793
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
This one's kind of surprising.

1794
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Civilization VI, as we know, is coming to the Nintendo Switch.

1795
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
It's not going to have online multiplayer.

1796
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Right?

1797
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Right? Now, it has local multiplayer.

1798
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,000
You can play locally, but it will not have online.

1799
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Which is something we've kind of gotten used to having in Civilization games ever since.

1800
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Like, I think even the second one had it built in.

1801
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I know the first one had Civ Net, which was a re-release of the first one just so you could play online.

1802
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
But yeah, online Civilization play has always been a thing.

1803
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
So it's a little weird that it's not in the Switch version.

1804
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
But apparently a Reddit user spotted something kind of weird with the eShop

1805
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
that talked about how you can play over local wireless.

1806
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
And it didn't talk about anything online.

1807
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
They say, a 2K spokesperson said via email,

1808
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Civilization VI for Nintendo Switch includes support for local cooperative and competitive multiplayer

1809
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
for up to four players via a wireless network.

1810
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It will not have online multiplayer.

1811
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
That's weird.

1812
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Yeah.

1813
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Do they not want to run the servers for it or something?

1814
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
It's got to be something along those lines. I don't know.

1815
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Especially when you consider, when did they unveil Civilization VI?

1816
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Is it going to have, like, local multiplayer?

1817
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Yes, I just said. It's going to have plenty of the local.

1818
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
So you can do that.

1819
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
That's a long time, though, playing Civ. I mean, I don't know.

1820
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Honestly, the LAN local...

1821
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Are we not trying to sell this online thing that they have?

1822
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I mean, because...

1823
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
That's what I was just saying.

1824
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
When did they announce Civilization VI?

1825
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Do you remember, Loki?

1826
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
What Nintendo Direct did they announce Civilization VI in?

1827
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
During the multiplayer thing?

1828
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
During the online presentation.

1829
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
That's kind of weird.

1830
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Right?

1831
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
That's the weird part to me.

1832
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Did they go back on it and change their mind?

1833
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I don't know. I don't know.

1834
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
So what features are you providing us, Nintendo, with our online features?

1835
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
What?

1836
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
We have free Nintendo games.

1837
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Start to See You in Chat says, that's an important distinction.

1838
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Civ VI does have local multiplayer, though no online is a little weird.

1839
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I mean, why not something like the play-by-email model, where you can take your turn whenever?

1840
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Oh, God, I forgot that was a thing.

1841
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
In one of the Civ games, I think it was Civ IV, you could play by email.

1842
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
So you would email your move, and then somebody would open it up, take their move, email it back,

1843
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
and that's how you would play.

1844
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Like, it would take you a fucking year to get through a game of Civilization that way.

1845
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
I mean, I have... I seem to remember this was a thing.

1846
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Am I crazy, you guys, or was this a thing?

1847
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
That, like, board game enthusiasts would set up an entire board game, like, in their living room,

1848
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
and people would play via postcard.

1849
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Like, they would email their... or they would write it on postcard and send it and play by mail.

1850
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Like, that was a thing that people used to do.

1851
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Used to see that in the back of, like, these tabletop books or, like, magazines or...

1852
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
So, like, I'm not crazy. That used to be a thing.

1853
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
So, Civilization IV, I think it was IV. I'm sorry if I got the wrong version.

1854
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
But it had something similar, but it was email. You played by email.

1855
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Kind of a fun little throwback to that, those sort of days.

1856
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,000
So, Izet in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

1857
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
My dad did that with war games. VidPower says, mail chess.

1858
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
That's right, chess was a big thing for that.

1859
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Yeah, but unfortunately you can't do that with email and the Switch, because there's no email.

1860
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Yeah, I know, there's no email on the Switch. I know, I know.

1861
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
But it's a cute idea.

1862
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I guess you could tie it with your phone app, because, hey, don't you all have phones?

1863
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
What?

1864
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
You asshole, that is so funny. All right.

1865
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Way to bring it full circle, Logie. All right.

1866
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
We do have that wonderful phone app that...

1867
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
No, I know, I know.

1868
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
You know what? No, we shouldn't be inventing other ways that Civ can be online.

1869
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
They should just have the fucking online mobile.

1870
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Maybe just tunnel it. People will just find a way to tunnel it.

1871
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Dungeon Buster says,

1872
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Online's not a huge thing with me for Civ games either, but it's unusual in mission.

1873
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Omission, excuse me.

1874
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Bobby Blackwell says,

1875
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
The tagline for this episode is, Don't you all have phones?

1876
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,000
You know what, though, to be fair, we don't put show quotes in our title.

1877
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
That just never took off for this show, because we're too old, I guess.

1878
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
But I bet those shows out there that do name their shows,

1879
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I bet you that title's going to show up a lot.

1880
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Because, you know, what do you mean you can't listen to this podcast?

1881
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Don't you all have phones?

1882
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
All right, anyway.

1883
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Let's, you know what, let's go back to a simpler time when, no,

1884
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
not everybody had phones.

1885
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Although, actually, I think with this particular game of the week,

1886
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
you did have phones, but it was like the very first iPhone.

1887
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
It was the very first one.

1888
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
You had flip phones.

1889
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Or flip phones. Is that like my old, that old thing I used to,

1890
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
you remember my flip phone I had when we lived together?

1891
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
It was like, ooh, this thing takes pictures,

1892
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
and it was like 64 by 64, like little pixel-sized things.

1893
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
It was like grainy as fuck.

1894
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Anyway, we're going to take a trip down memory lane

1895
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
with the classic game of the week.

1896
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
And so we're going to take a step back,

1897
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
and face, and time, and magic, and all that stuff,

1898
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
and visit with Dark Sakura, thanks to Skype,

1899
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
for our classic game of the week.

1900
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
You there, Jamie?

1901
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I am.

1902
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Hi, Jamie, how are you?

1903
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I'm doing okay.

1904
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
All right.

1905
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Lazy day.

1906
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Yeah, lazy day. It's been a lazy weekend.

1907
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
But, you know, after Halloween, you expect, you know,

1908
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
you need a little recovery time.

1909
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Because I don't know about you, but my Halloween was crazy.

1910
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Yeah, mine was, actually I spent it at work,

1911
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
but it was still pretty fun.

1912
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Yeah, well, hey, that's a little crazy too.

1913
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Crazy money.

1914
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
You're making some crazy money.

1915
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Yeah, really.

1916
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Oops, the wrong classic game of the week.

1917
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault

1918
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
and find one game that she thinks,

1919
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
hey, you brats should be paying attention to this game.

1920
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
But in a little twist on the year, once a month,

1921
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
she chooses a peripheral instead.

1922
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,000
So I believe tonight we have a classic peripheral of the month

1923
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
for the month of November.

1924
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Am I right?

1925
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Yes, you are correct.

1926
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I have chosen as our peripheral the Wii Balance Board,

1927
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
or as it was called in Japan, Balenzu Wiibodou.

1928
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
All right.

1929
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,000
And the music tonight is actually coming from Wii Fit U,

1930
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
because I had a really hard time finding the original Wii Fit,

1931
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
like play stuff on YouTube.

1932
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
It felt good.

1933
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Yeah.

1934
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Peripherals, no, no generation.

1935
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Exactly.

1936
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Well, and let's be real.

1937
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Wii Fit U is really just kind of like a cash in

1938
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
to try to get people to come over to the Wii U.

1939
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Pretty much.

1940
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Anyway, the Wii Balance Board first came out in Japan

1941
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
on December 10th, 2007,

1942
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
in Europe on April 26th, 2008,

1943
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Australia May 8th, 2008,

1944
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
and North America on May 19th, 2008.

1945
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
And then in Korea in December 2008.

1946
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,000
So it does actually fall under a 10-year range thing

1947
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
for classic stuff,

1948
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,000
but peripherals, like I said, no, no generation.

1949
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Well, no, it was a May...

1950
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Yeah, no, we're past May 2018,

1951
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
so it's been over 10 years.

1952
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Right.

1953
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Well, anyway, it is shaped kind of like a scale,

1954
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
like a full-body scale.

1955
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
It's plain white and gray.

1956
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
It runs on four AA batteries,

1957
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
and it can power for about 60 hours.

1958
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
It does use Bluetooth to connect,

1959
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
and has four pressure sensors

1960
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
to measure your center of balance.

1961
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
So that's where it gets the control from,

1962
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
is being a center of balance alignment tool.

1963
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
It can...

1964
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It actually has been flaunted

1965
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
that it can measure weight

1966
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
better than the traditional bathroom scale.

1967
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I mean, it's designed to support,

1968
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
for the Japanese one, up to 300 pounds,

1969
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
and the Western version up to 330 pounds,

1970
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
even though they are technically still the same device.

1971
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
They had to let us have a little more weight here.

1972
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Huh?

1973
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I said they had to let us have a little more weight here.

1974
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Well, it really is still the same one.

1975
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
It just has to do with the device calibration.

1976
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Ah.

1977
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,000
But it actually has been compared to the Joy Board

1978
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
that came out of the Atari VCS 1982.

1979
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
But, of course, you know, the Wii Balance Board

1980
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
is quite a bit more, I'd say, advanced.

1981
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
And so, basically,

1982
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,000
you can actually get Wii Fit non-skid socks

1983
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
that were provided to members of Club Nintendo.

1984
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I know people who used the socks that were given

1985
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
at Kaiser whenever they had surgery.

1986
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Hmm.

1987
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
They pretty much, you know, just no skid hospital socks.

1988
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
At any rate, there are a few games

1989
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
that will support the balance board,

1990
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
of course Wii Fit being the main one.

1991
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
It was actually said that, you know,

1992
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
there were lots of third-party inquiries,

1993
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
you know, after it was announced.

1994
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
But they were also saying that

1995
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
the most straightforward game to come out for it

1996
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
would be some kind of snowboarding game.

1997
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
And so Wii Ski by Bondi Namco

1998
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
was the first third-party game to make use of the balance board.

1999
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,000
And it would also use the remote and nunchuck attachment as well.

2000
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
As far as games that will support it,

2001
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
there actually are a number of games that will,

2002
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
including All Star Cheer Squad by THQ,

2003
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
The Biggest Loser,

2004
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
CDR Hottest Party and Music Sit,

2005
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
and CDR Revolution,

2006
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
although I don't exactly understand how it would accurately use it.

2007
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
EA Sports NFL Training Camp,

2008
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
The Garfield Show that The Threat of Space was on ya.

2009
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
What?

2010
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Gets it with Mel B.

2011
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Oh, nice.

2012
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Another game by Marvelous Entertainment called Ikenie no Yoru,

2013
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Avatar the Game,

2014
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
quite a few of course fitness games,

2015
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party,

2016
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Punch-Out! used it,

2017
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Super Monkey Ball Step and Roll,

2018
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Tetris Party Deluxe,

2019
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I'm just picking like some weird ones on here,

2020
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:04,000
and then of course the WiiWare games were using it too.

2021
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
So there was that.

2022
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,000
But a few other things about it is that it reads the center of pressure.

2023
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:16,000
It actually is a proven tool for assessing center pressure displacement,

2024
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:24,000
so it could be used for different medical conditions to help with balance and treatment thereof.

2025
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
It sold 32 million units worldwide at launch,

2026
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:38,000
and that means that it was awarded a Guinness World Record for best selling personal weighing device.

2027
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
By January 2012, it sold 42 million units.

2028
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
And there you go, the Wii Balance Board,

2029
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
or Banasui Bodo in Japanese.

2030
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I never really thought of that,

2031
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
that like there's so many different types of scales and things that you can buy for your home

2032
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:01,000
that the Wii Fit Balance Board was so huge that it actually was the most popular scale

2033
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
for people to have in their home in a way.

2034
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
It's so weird.

2035
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
That it did.

2036
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Video games, their impact, amazing.

2037
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Right?

2038
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Yeah.

2039
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Well there it is, your classic peripheral of the month, the Wii Fit Balance Board.

2040
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
See, I thought this was going to be another thing kind of like when you did Steel Battalion,

2041
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
how it was kind of like the game and the peripheral kind of go together,

2042
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
but really not really.

2043
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:29,000
I kind of forgot just how big this thing was and how many games all really supported it

2044
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
because so many people bought Wii Fit.

2045
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Well yeah, like there's some other ones, like there was the Champion Jockey game,

2046
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:41,000
there was Dream Dance and Cheer, Don King Boxing.

2047
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
So a lot of those, I mean we know that the Wii ended up being like,

2048
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I don't want to say necessarily like a shovel ground for those fitness games, but kinda.

2049
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
You know what I mean?

2050
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Yeah, but I mean, and I'm looking at just the list of non-fitness-y games.

2051
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Like I said, there was Rayman in there.

2052
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Yeah.

2053
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
There was, well Mario and Sonic used it.

2054
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Yeah.

2055
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Let's play Ballerina.

2056
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Okay Jamie, when will we play Ballerina?

2057
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
That's something that was definitely an evaluage.

2058
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Yeah, no, I think it's cool.

2059
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
We kind of forget a little bit just how versatile this was, you know,

2060
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:24,000
and it was a Nintendo peripheral that really took off in the way that not every peripheral necessarily does.

2061
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Like, you know, a DDR dance mat wasn't probably used in that many games.

2062
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I know it ended up being in a few things besides just DDR, but it wasn't like that many.

2063
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,000
You know, Guitar Hero, Guitar Controller doesn't get used in that many other games,

2064
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
although there was a couple here and there, you know what I mean?

2065
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,000
It's just the balance board is just so big and hugely adopted,

2066
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,000
and ten years old now, which, you know, means everybody out there listening.

2067
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
You know what that means?

2068
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
You're old too.

2069
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Alright, well Jamie, sad to not have you in studio again this week,

2070
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,000
but I hope everything's going good with work, and I know we'll get you back in here soon,

2071
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
but anything else we need to talk about during your week before we head back to the main show?

2072
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I've started playing Magikarp Jump.

2073
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Oh God, you were telling me about how you're addicted to that on the phone, right?

2074
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
It's so stupid, and it's really cute.

2075
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Hey, what do you think about this?

2076
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Because I know this is a controversy we're going to tackle tonight on the show,

2077
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,000
and I definitely would welcome your opinion because I know you're a fan of many Blizzard products,

2078
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
having played things like World of Warcraft and so forth over the years,

2079
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:33,000
but, you know, a really negative reception happening to the Diablo mobile game announcement.

2080
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
How do you feel about Diablo going mobile?

2081
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I'll be honest, I didn't even know it was happening until you just now said it.

2082
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Yeah, it was...

2083
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
That's how out of Diablo I am.

2084
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Yeah, it was kind of their big announcement.

2085
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
It was the very end.

2086
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I mean, which is interesting because they announced a Warcraft 3 remaster,

2087
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
and I've got to be careful because I don't want to repeat what I'm going to say during the live show,

2088
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,000
but, you know, this was like the big tent pole they saved for the end was Diablo Immortal,

2089
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
their cell phone game, and a lot of people, like even at BlizzCon,

2090
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,000
somebody asked a question in one of those Q&A panels.

2091
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,000
It was like, is this an April Fool's joke, which I kind of cringed a little bit

2092
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
because I was like, wow, that's like super disrespectful,

2093
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
but it also kind of shows like the fan base is like really mad, yo.

2094
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Mm-mm.

2095
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Yeah.

2096
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
All right.

2097
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Well, you know, I think having a mobile Diablo, though,

2098
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,000
really isn't so much of a bad thing because it definitely expands the user base

2099
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
and it would definitely, I don't know,

2100
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:40,000
it sounds like it would actually be fairly good to have on a phone.

2101
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
I mean, it sounds like it would be fun.

2102
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Yeah, yeah.

2103
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
It's kind of a little bit where my head's at.

2104
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Like they could have announced it in a much better way,

2105
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
but I think at the end of the day, all of these haters are going to try it.

2106
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
It's going to be free.

2107
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Like I kind of think y'all are kidding yourselves

2108
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
if you're not going to at least download it.

2109
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
No, I'd probably give it a shot.

2110
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,000
We'll see.

2111
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
But actually, I kind of want to start playing WoW again.

2112
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
I've been paying for it.

2113
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I may as well, you know, play it.

2114
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Good idea.

2115
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
All right.

2116
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Well, Jamie, we're going to get back to the main show.

2117
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight before we head back?

2118
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Vote and don't vote stupidly.

2119
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Don't vote a party ticket.

2120
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Read everything and vote after lots of research.

2121
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
That's all I have to say.

2122
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Voting is important, y'all.

2123
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Don't forget about it.

2124
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Those of you that are in the U.S., voting day is Tuesday,

2125
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
and hopefully y'all registered to vote already.

2126
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
But many states do allow you to register the day of

2127
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
if for whatever reason you missed it.

2128
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Just don't forget to vote, you know, as Jamie said there.

2129
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Educate yourself on the issues and vote accordingly.

2130
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Please, please.

2131
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Anyway, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio,

2132
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
our 751st show already in progress.

2133
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
We've had a fun show so far talking about all this stuff.

2134
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
We had Shane on talking about The Quiet Man,

2135
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
which was a fun conversation.

2136
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
We were also talking about Diablo Immortal,

2137
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
which I was also, you know, pinging Jamie about a little bit there

2138
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
at the end of that segment.

2139
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
But while we were away in Radio Magic land,

2140
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,000
you were looking up what, memes about Diablo?

2141
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I was just looking up, reading Reddit,

2142
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
but, like, there's several memes already,

2143
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
just with the whole online thing.

2144
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
So, like, they have one with Sakurai.

2145
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
You know, it's clearly from the Smash Direct.

2146
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
It's like, some of you might be upset

2147
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
over the lack of basic online functionality built into the Switch,

2148
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
and then you see him just kind of sigh,

2149
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
and then it shows the phones up.

2150
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Do you guys not have phones?

2151
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Great, great.

2152
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
When you managed to slam two companies in your meme,

2153
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
that's pretty impressive.

2154
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
And, you know, while we were doing the first segment there,

2155
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
one of my Ingress buddies, who I think is actually listening,

2156
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,000
is that, actually sent me a picture, I guess, that was taken at BlizzCon.

2157
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
This isn't really a meme, but it's like a BlizzCon picture

2158
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
of, like, basically nobody playing Diablo Immortal.

2159
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
But I was looking in the background, I'm like,

2160
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
okay, well, nobody's there.

2161
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Like, they took this after closing or something.

2162
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Like, you can see, there's nobody in the background either.

2163
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
I'm like, I don't think it's just that booth.

2164
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
But apparently, it was pulled from Reddit,

2165
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,000
and it actually says that it was during the concert,

2166
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
but there was nobody at Diablo Mobile,

2167
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
and some of the others had, like, 10 to 20.

2168
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,000
There were some other lines that did have people in it.

2169
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
You just can't see it in the picture.

2170
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
But it was during the concert, so a little bit of in-between.

2171
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:23,000
But apparently, not a lot of people in line to play Diablo Immortal at that point.

2172
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
So, something that I'm sure Blizzard is noticing too.

2173
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:33,000
So, apparently, I know when I've gone to conventions before,

2174
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
they click how many people come through the line.

2175
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Like, I'm almost positive the Final Fantasy Fan Fest is one of these.

2176
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
They'll have a clicker when you get to the front of the line and go play.

2177
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
So, they know exactly how many people come through,

2178
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
and they'll be able to report that back.

2179
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
And if it seems like the Diablo thing is getting really low engagement

2180
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
for what was supposed to be their tentpole release,

2181
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
again, as I was kind of saying earlier,

2182
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I don't want to revisit this topic completely,

2183
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
but I do think Blizzard is going to be like,

2184
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,000
okay, again, 8.30 a.m. Monday morning, shut the door.

2185
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
What the fuck happened at BlizzCon, everybody?

2186
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
It's going to be a conversation.

2187
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
We'll have to see what follows up a little later.

2188
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
All right, anyway, let's see.

2189
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Vidpower in chat says, the time of day matters too.

2190
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:17,000
There's a pic floating around with all of the Diablo Immortal stations being played at one point.

2191
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Yeah, probably right when it first came out,

2192
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
because I'm sure there's a lot of people like me too.

2193
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Like, if you haven't figured it out, I'm very much of this mindset of,

2194
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I don't hate it.

2195
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
I'm probably not going to play it obsessively,

2196
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
but I'll download it and try it,

2197
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
and I'll be sad that I didn't actually get a Diablo 3 expansion,

2198
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
but then I'll remember that Blizzard's just fucking slow,

2199
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
and there'll be a Diablo 4 eventually,

2200
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
and this may or may not really be for me,

2201
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
but I'm kidding myself if I'm sitting here going,

2202
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I play a shit ton of mobile games.

2203
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I play Pokemon Go, Ingress,

2204
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
The Great League of the Lost,

2205
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
and all this other stuff I was mentioning in the first segment.

2206
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Like, of course I'm going to try it.

2207
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Could it be that people feel that they're entitled to bigger news

2208
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,000
because they paid $200 or whatever to get into BlizzCon?

2209
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
When it comes to dude who asked,

2210
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
is this an April Fool's joke?

2211
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Absolutely.

2212
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Entitlement is, I think, a keyword there.

2213
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
It's one that's being flung around on Twitter quite a bit

2214
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,000
with, I think, mixed truth,

2215
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
but, you know, I think entitlement's sure.

2216
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Like I said, that guy who asked that question,

2217
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
you paid $200 to be there.

2218
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Congrats, kid. You played yourself.

2219
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Blizzard got your money, and they don't even want money

2220
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
for Diablo Immortal to download.

2221
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Let's not.

2222
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Yeah, they don't want money to install it on your system,

2223
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
but, oh, they want your money.

2224
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I know.

2225
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
They want all of your money.

2226
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,000
They want your money, but I think a big meeting's going to happen Monday,

2227
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
and we'll see.

2228
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Anyway, I don't want to rehash part A.

2229
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
We've got to get into some more news here in part B.

2230
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
If you want to rehash it, though,

2231
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
we will welcome your phone calls on all these subjects later.

2232
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2233
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Be sure to add us on Skype if you haven't already.

2234
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Somebody was trying to get through last week and couldn't.

2235
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
It's because I hadn't seen their request and accepted it,

2236
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
so you do have to, like, add us on Skype.

2237
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I think that helps you get through.

2238
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,000
I may have locked that down because of spammers some time ago,

2239
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
because I don't know if you guys remember,

2240
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
we used to get, like, full-on, like, faxes, phone calls,

2241
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
so I think you have to be on our contact list to call us.

2242
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
No, seeing as spammers, like, I hadn't checked my PlayStation messages

2243
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,000
for a long time, and there were so many, like, bots.

2244
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Change your privacy settings so that only, like,

2245
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
friends of friends can message you.

2246
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
It'll help a lot.

2247
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Yeah, it's just like, delete, delete, delete, delete.

2248
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Yeah, that's irritating.

2249
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Totally irritating.

2250
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
All right, let's move on.

2251
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Rapid Fire News.

2252
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
What else do we have, Loki?

2253
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
So there's a pretty good chance that Sunset Overdrive is heading to PC.

2254
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:42,000
This is because the Korean's rating board listed a PC port of the version of the game.

2255
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Of course, also the ESRB has also added a listing for the PC version of the game as well,

2256
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
so perhaps we'll be getting a PC port soon,

2257
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,000
and maybe they'll be part of that whole, you know, expanded Game Pass service.

2258
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:02,000
I would definitely pick it up on PC, because I wanted to play the game on Xbox One,

2259
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
but I don't have an Xbox One, so, you know.

2260
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I grabbed it on that lovely Games with Gold thing,

2261
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
so I can play it on Xbox One eventually.

2262
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Yeah.

2263
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:18,000
And then, of course, for the month of November, we have our free games now,

2264
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
so for PlayStation, we had originally kind of talked about rumor,

2265
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
because they had leaked it out a little bit,

2266
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
but all of those rumored games are coming out,

2267
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:30,000
so Bulletstorm Full Clip Edition and Yakuza Kiwami on PlayStation 4,

2268
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:35,000
the Jackbox Party Pack 2 and Arkido series on PlayStation 3,

2269
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
and then the Vita games, which are also crossed by PlayStation 4,

2270
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Burly Man at Sea and Roundabout.

2271
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
I already have Roundabout.

2272
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Oh, I did buy that game, though.

2273
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
So that's going to be coming out as well in November.

2274
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:53,000
And then on the Xbox side of things, we've got Battlefield 1,

2275
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
which is pretty awesome.

2276
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
That's going to be out for the month of November,

2277
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:02,000
and then Race the Sun from the second half of November to the middle of December,

2278
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
and then your Xbox 360 compatible titles,

2279
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Assassin's Creed for the first half of November,

2280
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
and Dante's Inferno for the second half of November.

2281
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Pretty solid lineup.

2282
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Yeah.

2283
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I want to check out the Dante's Inferno,

2284
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
because I never did when it was originally out.

2285
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I'd rather have Battlefield 1 than...

2286
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Yeah, but you know I'm not a big Battlefield War game type of guy,

2287
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
but I guess when it's free, it's hard to complain.

2288
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Yeah.

2289
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Bonz006 says, Bulletstorm, I must say, I like that game.

2290
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Yeah.

2291
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Are the PS Plus stuff already gone live, or is that this next week?

2292
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
I think it's this next week. It was delayed.

2293
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
The ones that are up now are definitely worth grabbing,

2294
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
because they have the Tron-looking game is up there now,

2295
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
and what, Friday the 13th, I think?

2296
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Friday the 13th.

2297
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Yeah, so I remember triggering something else on there, too.

2298
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
There's a lot of good stuff right now, so kind of a reminder to you.

2299
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
I know this week, yeah, they should be switching them over this week,

2300
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
so just get a chance to go grab that.

2301
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

2302
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:00,000
All right, anyhow, we want to get to some more news,

2303
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
including Castlevania, which some of you are watching on Netflix.

2304
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Netflix apparently knocking that out of the park

2305
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
with some of the Halloween programming.

2306
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
I'm seeing nothing but...

2307
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Disclaimer, I haven't watched any of this myself.

2308
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,000
I've only heard of it through other people,

2309
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
but apparently the Haunting of Hill House show is phenomenal.

2310
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Yeah, my wife said it was too scary to watch,

2311
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
so she's not watching it.

2312
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Oh, boy, okay.

2313
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I was like, well, now I kind of want to see it, but...

2314
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Now you want to watch it.

2315
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I hear Sabrina's great.

2316
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
The Reimagining of Sabrina is really good.

2317
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
That's the one I really want to see,

2318
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
because I actually liked Riverdale.

2319
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
And then apparently Castlevania is also really good,

2320
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
and apparently in this season,

2321
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
they actually incorporate Bloody Tears in some of the music.

2322
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Yeah, I still haven't seen the first season yet.

2323
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
I need to watch it, but...

2324
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Well, you're going to have to catch up,

2325
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
because not only do you need to watch season two now,

2326
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
but there is going to be a season three.

2327
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
That's right, Netflix did confirm Castlevania will be back

2328
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
for a third season.

2329
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,000
It is going to be loosely...

2330
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I guess the whole series is based on Castlevania III,

2331
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Dracula's Curse,

2332
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
but the anime's been pretty well received.

2333
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Apparently the writing is really good,

2334
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
and the same writer's going to be coming back

2335
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
for the third season to continue as a writer

2336
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
and executive producer.

2337
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Apparently rumors that...

2338
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Big rumors that one of the show's executive producers,

2339
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
apparently Adi Shankar,

2340
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
may be doing a Zelda thing.

2341
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Haven't heard a lot more than that than just rumors,

2342
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
but I think that would be really interesting.

2343
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Also, speaking of people wanting to do things,

2344
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
this didn't really make our show roll tonight,

2345
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
but did you see that whole tweet where Brie Larson,

2346
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
who's Captain Marvel, right?

2347
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,000
She's a Sacramento local, someone from our town.

2348
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Brie Larson wore that Zero Suit Samus outfit for Halloween,

2349
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
and somebody kind of asked her about a Metroid movie,

2350
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
and I'm paraphrasing, but she basically said,

2351
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
let's make it happen.

2352
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
I would love to do it.

2353
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Yeah, they said that this is going to be the closest

2354
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
we're going to get to a live action Metroid movie,

2355
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
and she's like, I hope not,

2356
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
because I would love to play that character.

2357
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
And Brie Larson as Samus?

2358
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
I'm good with that.

2359
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I'd like to see that, yeah.

2360
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
I've been a fan of hers ever since Scott Pilgrim.

2361
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Oh yeah, she was in that.

2362
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Yeah, all those Scott Pilgrim throwaway roles

2363
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:05,000
and people in them, they're all huge now.

2364
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
It's kind of something else. It's weird.

2365
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,000
That movie, by the way, is also on Netflix now.

2366
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Is it?

2367
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
If I saw that, I'd be like, oh, I want to watch that again.

2368
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Because you guys know on the side,

2369
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I do cult cinema hosting, right?

2370
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
I've done Rocky Horror for years,

2371
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,000
and I sometimes will do Repo, the genetic opera, Clue.

2372
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I've done a basic cult cinema hosting over the years.

2373
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I had a lot of fun when we did a doubleheader.

2374
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
We did Kung Fury, whichever you're excited about.

2375
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Yeah, I'm sad that I missed that.

2376
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Yeah, because we had Thor there in person.

2377
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
That would have been awesome.

2378
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Yeah, doing the Q&A with him was fun.

2379
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
But then the second movie we did,

2380
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
we did Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

2381
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Did everyone throw coins?

2382
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Oh, I wish we thought of that.

2383
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,000
That's a good idea.

2384
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
No, nobody really threw things.

2385
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,000
It wasn't total Rocky Horror.

2386
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
But there was something about watching it again

2387
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
on the big screen.

2388
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
I don't know if Shane's still in chat,

2389
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
but I dragged Shane to this.

2390
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Shane won't see Rocky Horror,

2391
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
but he went to see this because it was like,

2392
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
okay, that I'd go see.

2393
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
And I think he actually had a really good time,

2394
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
and I did too because there was something about watching it

2395
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
with a group of other people who are just nerds

2396
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
and happy to be there that actually made the movie

2397
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
a lot of fun.

2398
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
So I don't know if that movie just came out at a bad time.

2399
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
It was ahead of its time.

2400
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I don't know what, but that Scott Pilgrim's a lot of fun.

2401
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
It's ahead of its time.

2402
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Yeah.

2403
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
It's a great movie.

2404
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I love it.

2405
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
And Shane gives his raving reveal in our chat saying,

2406
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
yeah, I liked it.

2407
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Great movie.

2408
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
That's five stars from Shane.

2409
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Great movie and great game,

2410
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
because they have the pixel art beat-em-up game.

2411
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
That was a great game.

2412
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
All right, anyway.

2413
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Also in rapid fire news,

2414
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,000
the story I meant to talk about was the great PT debacle.

2415
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Did you hear about this?

2416
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Yeah.

2417
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Apparently Konami kills, well, here's the,

2418
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
apparently the internet rumors started this big thing on Twitter,

2419
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,000
and I admit I bought into it because there were screenshot proof.

2420
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
So I thought, you know, but I guess it was, anyway,

2421
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,000
apparently Konami was accused of pulling the kill switch on PT,

2422
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:00,000
basically releasing a tiny little patch that disabled it completely.

2423
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
So it was a nasty little Halloween trick because a lot of streamers were

2424
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
getting excited to play PT on Halloween because what a good, you know,

2425
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,000
it was a great scary game, but apparently through some follow-up and such,

2426
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
a lot of people are saying, I never got that patch.

2427
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I didn't get that patch.

2428
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
It doesn't look like that patch actually exists.

2429
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:21,000
So either one person only got that patch or they made up a nasty little

2430
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Halloween trick themselves.

2431
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,000
They made up a nasty little...

2432
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Now before we all talk about how we should apologize profusely to

2433
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Konami, here's the thing though.

2434
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
The fact that it was believable as it was,

2435
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Konami doesn't exactly have the best reputation in the gaming industry right

2436
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
now. And they did kind of dick PT over in a lot of other ways. Well,

2437
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I mean, canceling Silent Hills was probably one of the biggest,

2438
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
but you know what I mean?

2439
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Like the fact that you can't even like download it and all this other stuff,

2440
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
it's a little...

2441
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Well, it's also not, let's not put it past them because I mean,

2442
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
after all they did also remove Hideo Kojima's name off the cover of,

2443
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,000
you know, or any mention to him in, um, you know,

2444
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Metal Gear Solid 5 and I don't know.

2445
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Yeah. Dart Tetsuya in chat kind of sums it up saying, yeah,

2446
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,000
this isn't really out of the realm of possibility for them to do so.

2447
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
That's not a good look. I mean,

2448
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,000
would you believe this story from any other gaming company? I don't know,

2449
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
but, uh, that was it.

2450
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,000
They seem like a special kind of spiteful to do something like that though.

2451
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:21,000
If you buy into all the talk about some of the stuff they did to Kojima and

2452
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:26,000
all this, apparently now Kibadea too. Like apparently they're just not nice people.

2453
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
It sounds like. So anyway,

2454
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,000
let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games

2455
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:37,000
that will be coming out to a game store near you or online very soon. Loki.

2456
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
All right. So we've got, um,

2457
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
on the switch moonlighter and then, uh,

2458
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
we have carnival games coming out on the switch as well.

2459
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:51,000
De Rescini, I have no idea how to pronounce this.

2460
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Um, I think it's, Oh,

2461
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,000
but it looks cool though. Uh, De Rescini, I guess.

2462
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:06,000
It's a game by armored, the armored core team from software. Um,

2463
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,000
it's a VR game, PlayStation VR. I'm down.

2464
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I don't know what it is or how to pronounce the fucking name,

2465
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,000
but if it's a PS VR game by from software, yes.

2466
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Yeah. Um, let's see.

2467
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And then we've got the forest, which is a Sarava game on PlayStation four, uh,

2468
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:29,000
grip on the switch, which I believe is a racing game. Uh,

2469
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:34,000
omen of sorrow on PlayStation four over kills the walking dead on PC and the

2470
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:42,000
world of final fantasy maxima on PC switch PlayStation four and Xbox one.

2471
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Oh yeah. I forgot they were re releasing that. Yeah. Yeah.

2472
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,000
And then of course, last but not least on Friday,

2473
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Tetris effect on PlayStation four. Uh,

2474
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
some comments with releases in our chat. Uh,

2475
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Shane says Loki is going to be so disappointed with that VR game from,

2476
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,000
from software. Is there, is there reasoning?

2477
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Is there evidence to support that claim? I don't know.

2478
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Curious what that's about. Maybe I will be. I don't know.

2479
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,000
S two and a hundred. Matt says, yeah, the forest. Great creepy game.

2480
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
I could be, you know,

2481
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,000
I had to look up some screenshots now cause it's possible.

2482
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Maybe my expectations are too high.

2483
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:24,000
You high expectations.

2484
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
It's all right. Software though. Uh,

2485
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Shane says it's like you're a ghost or something in a school. Oh, lame.

2486
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
All right. So it's not a, it's not a mech warrior game then. No,

2487
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,000
that would be the one that's coming on the switch at some point. That's why.

2488
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,000
All right, well let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases

2489
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,000
over in Japan. So this week,

2490
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
uh, there's really just one to look forward to on the PlayStation four.

2491
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
It's Dara CNA I think is how you would pronounce the one that I was just

2492
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:51,000
talking about. Yeah. Dara CNA is also out, uh, in Japan this week.

2493
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
So I guess it's a worldwide release if you will.

2494
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:56,000
And that really does appear to be the only major release on the PlayStation

2495
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
four this week. A Vita is slowing down as we kind of alluded to earlier in the

2496
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
show. They have no releases this week. Uh,

2497
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
the Nintendo switch has a little bit more going on though.

2498
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
They have a Pika chin kit, game day,

2499
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,000
pyramechi daisatsu Sen. Uh, and then, uh,

2500
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:15,000
they also have, uh, the, some amiibo coming out on the ninth.

2501
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Uh, their splatoon two series with the octoling girl, boy and octopus.

2502
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:22,000
That is all out in Japan this week. Now that I read up on this,

2503
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,000
it's a VR debut from director, uh,

2504
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Hidetaka Miyazaki and from software Miyazaki and from software together,

2505
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,000
probably going to be Cooney. No, that was level five. Hmm. I don't know.

2506
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
We'll, we'll see. I, I, I'm a little bit more optimistic now,

2507
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:42,000
but check it out. All right. Uh, anyway, let's move over to the UK.

2508
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Loki, do you have those two? Yes. So, uh, coming out in the UK,

2509
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:51,000
probably kind of the same type of stuff. We have carnival games on the switch,

2510
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,000
uh, grip on the switch, PlayStation four,

2511
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Xbox one and PC ride three on, uh,

2512
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,000
PlayStation four and Xbox one and PC 11 11

2513
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:10,000
memories retold on PlayStation four and Xbox one,

2514
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,000
uh, NBA two K playgrounds two on PlayStation four,

2515
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Xbox one and the switch moonlighter on PlayStation four

2516
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:22,000
and the switch hit man to gold edition. Um,

2517
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:27,000
that's going to be coming out on the PlayStation four and Xbox

2518
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:31,000
one. And then, uh, oh, actually a few more, uh, the Sims four expansion,

2519
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:35,000
get famous, uh, Minecraft. And that was, that's on PC, uh,

2520
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Minecraft story mode season two on the switch and the Gianna Swister or

2521
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Gianna sisters, twisted dreams, ultimate edition on the switch.

2522
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:49,000
That's it. I didn't see any, uh, no Tetris effect over there.

2523
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Yeah. Um, or maybe it's online only or something. I don't know.

2524
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Maybe they're not doing a physical release over there.

2525
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Maybe it's just not on your list for whatever. That's strange. No. All right.

2526
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Well anyhow, uh,

2527
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:03,000
let's go to the mailbag because every week you guys would send us emails over

2528
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,000
at participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us emails.

2529
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,000
And this is the part of the show where we would read them if we had any.

2530
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Sadly, it's an empty mailbag this week.

2531
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:19,000
I guess we got to talk about failed us drag race or what was it?

2532
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Oh, that's right. Cause we have to fill in talk with drag race.

2533
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
We don't get emails. We have to talk about RuPaul's drag race. Um, okay.

2534
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,000
They're going to be doing a RuPaul's drag race Christmas special this year that

2535
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
was announced this week. A one off Christmas special, uh,

2536
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:36,000
that is going to feature Trixie Mattel and Latrice Royale and a lot of these

2537
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,000
big names, plus some people we haven't seen in a while, like Sonique from season two.

2538
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Uh, but shangela is in it and considering all her game of thrones references,

2539
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,000
the fact that she was robbed in all stars three, the fact that, you know,

2540
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,000
with all the game of thrones,

2541
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,000
she could just say winter is coming and that she's known for a lot of her

2542
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Christmas looks like just fucking crown it like shangela's already won.

2543
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
It's going to be shangela versus Trixie in the end,

2544
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
but this time they're going to crown shangela and that's, that's,

2545
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
that's how, wow, world of wonder and everything we balance.

2546
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
All things should be, that's right.

2547
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Everything balance will be as much as I love Trixie Mattel. I really do. Uh,

2548
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:08,000
all stars three with some, some messed up stuff. Don't you agree? Loki?

2549
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Wasn't that messed up? All stars three.

2550
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Having no context of what you're talking about right now. I will,

2551
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:18,000
I'll hesitate and agree. Yes. Okay. All right.

2552
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:22,000
That's enough punishment. Let's get into, uh, some more gaming news. Uh,

2553
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
but if you want to, uh, talk about something other than RuPaul's drag race,

2554
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,000
you can send us an email.

2555
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Participate at orange launch trader.com is the place to send us an email in a

2556
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
future week. Loki.

2557
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:34,000
So we finally got the announcement of the full roster of games.

2558
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:38,000
They're going to be a part of the PlayStation classic. So starting in,

2559
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:41,000
apparently it is in different regions. They have different games.

2560
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,000
So let's start off with what we're getting in North America.

2561
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Battle riatoshi then cool borders to destruction Derby,

2562
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:53,000
final fantasy seven grand theft auto intelligent cube jumping flash.

2563
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Mel, you're solid. Mr driller, odd world,

2564
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,000
rolled Abe's odyssey Rayman resident evil director's cup,

2565
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:04,000
revelations persona Ridge racer type form super puzzle fighter to turbo siphon

2566
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:10,000
filter tech and three Tom Clancy's rainbow six twisted or twisted Mel and wild

2567
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,000
arms. Uh, so those are all going to be coming to the North American version.

2568
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Um,

2569
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:21,000
lots of games that I'm surprised are missing from that list that I would have

2570
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
thought that they weren't been there. Like, you know,

2571
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
per rap of a rapper, um,

2572
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,000
might have been one or even like Ein hinder or something like that.

2573
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Now in Japan, it's all stuff that's being remastered.

2574
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
It's all stuff that's been remastered somewhere else.

2575
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
So they don't want to put it on, but Japan seems to be getting the better of

2576
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,000
the two, you know, releases. Cause over there they're getting arc of the lad,

2577
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,000
arc of the lad to armored core. Um,

2578
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Grady has guide in. Um,

2579
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I think it's not sigh saga, frontier G Darius and parasite Eve.

2580
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Those are all the exclusive ones. And then on top of that,

2581
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Richard's type four intelligent cube, uh, jumping flash, puzzle fighter,

2582
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:06,000
tech and three battle re-enthusiastic and resident evil, uh,

2583
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:10,000
file 57, Mr. Driller persona, Miller, your soul and wild arms.

2584
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I would rather have the Japanese one. I mean, well,

2585
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
there's a lot of strong opinions in our chat room.

2586
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
I'll get to that in a minute, but I got to say like,

2587
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
I wasn't really super on board with PlayStation classics to begin with just

2588
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
because I'm feeling the classic system burnout.

2589
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Although earlier tonight before our shows went on air,

2590
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Bobby and I were having a conversation cause we were coordinating the,

2591
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
cause we're doing something special for post-show tonight.

2592
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
So we're coordinating that. But we also kind of talked about, he was like, Hey,

2593
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Rob, uh, did you know that Commodore 64 mini finally got released, uh,

2594
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,000
in the U S officially this week? And I was like, Oh yeah, that's the thing.

2595
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Shit. I kind of want to buy that because I heard about the whole,

2596
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:46,000
you can load D four or D 64 images on a USB stick and like play them on the

2597
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
USB mini or on the Commodore 64 mini.

2598
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,000
So it opens like I could play whatever game I want basically.

2599
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Cause I mean shit, that system's like 35 years old.

2600
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
I think everybody's given up their copyright on that.

2601
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:00,000
That is really the only reason why I want one of these is because that shit is

2602
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,000
going to be broken up day one and I can put whatever the fuck I want on there.

2603
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,000
You know, if I want to play driver for example. Well, you know what,

2604
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,000
actually now that I think of it, why aren't some of these games on there?

2605
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:15,000
And actually I'm surprised armored cores on there because that I thought was

2606
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
something that used the dual shock a little bit.

2607
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Well, so does metal gear solid infamously,

2608
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
but when you put it on the table and it shakes, remember that?

2609
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:25,000
But I won't be there. Yeah, they're not going to have that.

2610
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Obviously they're going to save that for the second one.

2611
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Yeah, of course they're thinking ahead like that,

2612
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
but I think maybe they're saving too much for the second one.

2613
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
They should have thought ahead and made this one expandable.

2614
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:37,000
I thought when we got into the whole fact that this should have just been like

2615
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:40,000
a Vita TV loaded with PlayStation games,

2616
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,000
like I thought that was really honestly the brilliant idea because you download

2617
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
more on the internet, but whatever. It's not going to be that.

2618
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,000
And I just, I'm a little burned out on the classic systems and I'm,

2619
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:53,000
I think it's great that some deep cuts like a super puzzle.

2620
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Well, really intelligent cube is the deep cut and that's a hard to get.

2621
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Like stuff like 16 bit and NES games look pretty nice when it's up res

2622
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:06,000
and stuff in like, you know, 4k or even just like a 1080 or whatever.

2623
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,000
PlayStation 1 games, not so much.

2624
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Low tech, you know, the low quality textures, low poly,

2625
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:21,000
not, doesn't age as well as, you know, a 16 bit game that's all sprite based.

2626
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:24,000
I mean, it's just, it's not the same.

2627
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
And I think even like with the Nintendo 64,

2628
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
that's going to be kind of cutting it a little bit.

2629
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,000
I mean, granted, I'd still probably pick it up because I love Nintendo 64 as well,

2630
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:35,000
but I hadn't even going back and playing like Ridge Racer type four.

2631
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
It's like, I don't remember it looking this bad.

2632
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Going to chat, Bobby Blackwolf is talking about the Commodore 64 mini saying

2633
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
it was broken up by the hardware manufacturer.

2634
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
It's not even a third party firmware update.

2635
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
It's a first party firmware update, the official site.

2636
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
I mean, it might be a little less cool for you, but whatevs.

2637
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Yeah. I mean, important distinction.

2638
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:57,000
That Commodore 64 thing is like an official update that's supported by the makers.

2639
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
It's not, it's not cool.

2640
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
They are. Yeah. Which, yeah, I think that is cool.

2641
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,000
But again, and you can also, I guess I'm going to just talk everything

2642
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
that Bobby and I talked about off air,

2643
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:09,000
but Bobby and I were talking about how funny would it be to do a live stream

2644
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:13,000
on the VOG channel or something where we type a program in

2645
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
from the back of a magazine live.

2646
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
That would be cool.

2647
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Why wouldn't that be awesome?

2648
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I think it would.

2649
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:26,000
There is, there is a category on Twitch for computer programming

2650
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,000
or something like that.

2651
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
So I know there's game development because that's it.

2652
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
That's a game because I try to like, that's the thing is like,

2653
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
you know how they have all those tags and stuff.

2654
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:37,000
So I try to tag my stream, my streams I do with some relevant tags,

2655
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:40,000
but they're all like for the IRL stuff.

2656
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:45,000
So I'm like, well crap, I can't, none of this really applies to what I'm doing.

2657
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Our chat room is lighting up.

2658
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,000
And so, you know what, all I'm going to say is this, please look forward to it.

2659
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
I think this is something we're going to have to do.

2660
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:57,000
The official typing in, maybe we'll have to do it for charity or something.

2661
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Let me get a charity thing.

2662
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Like I'll do it for part of the day.

2663
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,000
I really want to do like.

2664
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Bobby can do it.

2665
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,000
The extra life thing would have been awesome if I got like, you know,

2666
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
a day to myself.

2667
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
I know, I know.

2668
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Get a set mania machine, put it in there.

2669
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Dartusia says, make sure you have a USB keyboard.

2670
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,000
You'll have to use the hunt and peck keyboard and you'll be there all day.

2671
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Honestly, I feel like it'll go by faster on a real keyboard.

2672
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Like I know how to type on those now.

2673
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Like when I was like, cause remember when the Converse 64 was out,

2674
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
I was like six.

2675
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
So I was doing the hunt and peck thing until, you know,

2676
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:32,000
I used my typing tutorials, FFFJJ, FFFJJ to learn how to type.

2677
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
But anyway.

2678
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
I never learned how to type.

2679
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Okay.

2680
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
It wasn't supposed to be about the Commodore 64 mini,

2681
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:40,000
although I guess maybe you guys are responding to that more positively.

2682
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I do want to read some comments about the PlayStation classic mini.

2683
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:47,000
SG100 Matt says, some of those games are pretty good.

2684
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Act Def says, the PlayStation classic sucks, sucks big time.

2685
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Shane says, this list announcement caused me to cancel my pre-order.

2686
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Dartusia says, I do appreciate them, including Toshinen and IQ,

2687
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,000
but a good chunk of those games support the DualShock.

2688
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Orange Right saying, it's cool to see R4 at least.

2689
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Yeah.

2690
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
That's R4 is like, but see, that's the thing too.

2691
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Like R4 is a pretty good game.

2692
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Cool Wars 2, I think is better than the first one.

2693
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:17,000
But like, I guess like with Twisted Metal and stuff that maybe it's because,

2694
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
you know, the other games use the DualShock.

2695
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Like I would have thought Twisted Metal 2 would have been a better choice.

2696
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Or like, I don't know, like even with, um, I don't know.

2697
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Some of these, like I just don't see it.

2698
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Mr. Driller.

2699
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Really? Is that like really worth putting in there?

2700
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
I mean, it's an all right game.

2701
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,000
That game was pretty huge.

2702
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,000
I think in other areas that weren't necessarily the US.

2703
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Yeah.

2704
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Or Grand Theft Auto.

2705
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:45,000
I mean, Grant, the original Grand Theft Auto is kind of, it's old.

2706
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
It's so old.

2707
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I don't remember.

2708
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
I don't remember.

2709
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Well, Sandra isn't all that.

2710
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
So that was all PlayStation 2.

2711
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
That was the only problem.

2712
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Well, people are going to think Grand Theft Auto is like,

2713
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
they're going to see that and think, oh,

2714
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,000
it's like the new ones and then kind of be a little disappointed.

2715
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,000
No, no, it's not.

2716
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
All right.

2717
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Well, anyway,

2718
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:08,000
let's move on to some other things that were announced at BlizzCon.

2719
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Again, this is one of those things I'm kind of surprised they didn't do on

2720
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
the main stage.

2721
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Um, but it was something they kind of, you know,

2722
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
had out there on the show floor, maybe because it was third party.

2723
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
I don't know.

2724
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Well, I thought they announced this before.

2725
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I think they announced the partnership between Lego and Overwatch,

2726
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
but we got details.

2727
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,000
I saw those earlier in the week, but maybe that's just,

2728
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
maybe they leaked out or something.

2729
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Well, whatever.

2730
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Anyway.

2731
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
I still want them.

2732
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Six Overwatch themed building sets.

2733
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
That's the point.

2734
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
With vehicles, characters, and weapons from the game.

2735
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Starting next year, there's a Tracer versus Widowmaker set,

2736
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:45,000
where you can do the drone satellite from Watchpoint Gibraltar.

2737
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:48,000
There's a Hanzo versus Genji where you're in the Hanamura dojo.

2738
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
That's pretty cool.

2739
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Dorado Showdown will be Soldier 76, Reaper,

2740
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
and McCree in buildings from the Dorado map.

2741
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,000
And there's a D.Va and Reinhardt set with a buildable mech suit

2742
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:01,000
and a powered armor that the heroes will bring into battle.

2743
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
So it's kind of like, you know,

2744
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,000
their characters are much more involved because you build the whole mech

2745
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
and then you build the whole Reinhardt shield and all that.

2746
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
So that's pretty cool.

2747
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,000
There's a Bastion set with a buildable version of the character

2748
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:14,000
and you can do both recon mode and sentry mode

2749
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
because Legos, you can change it.

2750
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
So that's kind of fun.

2751
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:21,000
There is a 730 piece Watchpoint Gibraltar set

2752
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
with Mercy, Reaper, Winston, and Pharah.

2753
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
These sets will start at $14.99,

2754
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,000
which is probably for that smaller, maybe the Hanamura set,

2755
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,000
and go all the way up to $90 probably for that Watchpoint Gibraltar

2756
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
because Legos ain't cheap.

2757
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,000
So anyway, you can start getting these on January 1st, 2019.

2758
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Actually, you can start getting them now

2759
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:47,000
because they have that one Bastion set.

2760
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
It was the alternate skin or whatever

2761
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
that you can actually get through the Blizzard store.

2762
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
You can get that now.

2763
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
That's cool.

2764
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
I wonder if my, since my husband likes Overwatch so much,

2765
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
I wonder if he would want me to spend all that money on Overwatch Legos.

2766
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
I don't know.

2767
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
He's making an ahh noise from the other room.

2768
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Act Def does say in chat over at live.vognetware.com

2769
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
$90 is kind of too much.

2770
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Have you looked at Legos lately?

2771
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,000
You must not shop for Legos often.

2772
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
It's a good thing it's not Star Wars.

2773
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Yeah, right.

2774
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Anyway, a few more stories before we get to the Skype line

2775
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
at Orange Launch Radio.

2776
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Loki.

2777
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Their stupid $799 Millennium Falcon.

2778
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Yeah, they can shove that $799 up their ass

2779
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
because I ain't never gonna pay that.

2780
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:36,000
So anyways, talking about classic collections.

2781
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Sega Genesis classics are gonna be coming to Nintendo Switch in December.

2782
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:46,000
And you're gonna get 50 classic Sega Mega Drive and Genesis titles.

2783
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
And there's a lot.

2784
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
And I'm not gonna read all of them, but I'll read some of them

2785
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
that I think that you might like.

2786
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,000
So for example, let's talk about Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle.

2787
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Or we have Alien Storm.

2788
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Or Altered Beasts.

2789
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Columns.

2790
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Comic Zone.

2791
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Of course, Golden Axe, Golden Axe 2, Golden Axe 3.

2792
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Fantasy Star 2, 3, and 4.

2793
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Shining Force 1 and 2.

2794
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, 3D Blast.

2795
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Street Rage 1, 2, and 3.

2796
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Toejam and Earl 1 and 2.

2797
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Vector Man, Vector Man 2.

2798
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,000
And Virtual Fighter 2, among lots of other games.

2799
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Most of the same shit Sega's released over and over again over the years.

2800
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Although, I feel like they don't do Alex Kidd stuff enough.

2801
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
So I'm happy to hear that's coming back.

2802
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:40,000
But it's gonna be on the Switch because, you know, that's December 7th.

2803
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,000
And because, of course, they're not doing Virtual Console anymore,

2804
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
so this is why it's all in the collection.

2805
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Which, actually, probably for the money, you're gonna get a better deal

2806
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
than if you bought those all separately on Virtual Console.

2807
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Oh, for sure.

2808
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Now that I think about it, since I brought up Alex Kidd,

2809
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
why does the Sega bring that kid back?

2810
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:59,000
It seems like one of those old franchises that's really due for a reboot

2811
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
that, for whatever reason, has never happened. That's weird.

2812
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Is it because Sonic kind of took over all their platforming,

2813
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
so they have that tunnel vision?

2814
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
And that's all they want to release when it comes to platforming is Sonic?

2815
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
I'd love to see a new Alex Kidd game.

2816
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
No, Alex Kidd doesn't have enough stupid friends to bring along for the ride.

2817
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Well, invent some.

2818
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Alex Kidd in Shinobi World, you know, all that.

2819
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Maybe Alex Kidd can get introduced as one of Sonic's friends,

2820
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
and then we'll spin it off into it.

2821
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Well, and I'm sure somebody in chat's gonna have already said this,

2822
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:26,000
but Alex Kidd was in the Sega All-Stars racing game.

2823
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
The one with Danica Patrick.

2824
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Oh yeah, that new one's supposed to be coming out.

2825
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:32,000
I got him delayed, remember?

2826
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,000
At some point.

2827
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Yeah, I got pushed back a little bit, so I think that was a couple weeks ago,

2828
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
we talked about that, so.

2829
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Anyway, something else you can look forward to,

2830
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
and I'm sure you will be looking forward to this,

2831
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
a brand new Bubsy game.

2832
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
I can't even say his name right.

2833
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Fuck that shit.

2834
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Bubsy.

2835
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
It's Bubsy, that's right.

2836
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Aren't you excited that there's a new Bubsy game coming out?

2837
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,000
No, I'm not. He's an obnoxious piece of shit.

2838
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Bubsy Paws on Fire will be coming out for PC, PlayStation 4, and Switch.

2839
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Who wanted this?

2840
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Who wanted Bubsy?

2841
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Nobody fucking wants Bubsy.

2842
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Apparently people bought the stupid Bubsy game,

2843
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
because otherwise they wouldn't be making another Bubsy game.

2844
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Well, Bubsy will be bringing along three of his shitty friends

2845
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
for four playable characters,

2846
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
that each one has their own unique play style,

2847
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
according to the press release.

2848
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Oh wow, that's so 2019 or 18.

2849
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,000
New moves never before seen in a Bubsy title.

2850
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
And over 100 levels.

2851
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
And they say, I love this, this is in the press release,

2852
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Paws on Fire is a game for Bubsy lovers and haters alike.

2853
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
No, if I hate it, I'm not buying it.

2854
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
I love it. I loved it in the press release.

2855
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
This one's for my haters.

2856
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
This goes out to my haters.

2857
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:50,000
You know what, if you're gonna bring back old-ass platformer games,

2858
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,000
then I want a fucking new Gex game, god damn it.

2859
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Gex deserves another game.

2860
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Now, Akdeft in chat points out the only good thing about this

2861
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,000
is that it's made by the people from the Bit.Trip Runner series.

2862
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
It does look like this is a runner game,

2863
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
which is how they made 100-plus levels.

2864
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
It looks like it might be a runner title.

2865
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Which, you know, low-key, before I know you,

2866
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
I feel the judgment coming off of you,

2867
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,000
but those Bit.Trip Runner games are pretty fucking good, I gotta say.

2868
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:18,000
So, I mean, if they're just slapping Bubsy onto that,

2869
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I mean, downright-

2870
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Do you know why they're good?

2871
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Because Bubsy is not fucking in those games.

2872
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
That's why they're good.

2873
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Nobody said, hey, you know what?

2874
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
These runner games, they need more Bubsy.

2875
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Rageinator in chat says,

2876
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:33,000
new moves never seen before in a Bubsy game.

2877
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Does that feature make it fun?

2878
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Is Shane still listening?

2879
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Shane, if you're listening, I got a question for you.

2880
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Which was worse?

2881
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:45,000
The Quiet Man or Bubsy 3D?

2882
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
What do you think, Logie?

2883
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Which one's worse, the Quiet Man?

2884
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Which would you rather be forced to play for an hour?

2885
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
The Quiet Man or Bubsy 3D?

2886
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Bubsy 3D.

2887
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Shane confirming in chat that the Quiet Man was the worst game.

2888
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Exactly.

2889
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
So, Bubsy, you got that.

2890
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
At least you're not the Quiet Man.

2891
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Avant-garde Bubsy.

2892
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Yeah, that's all I need to say.

2893
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,000
And the trick in Bubsy is that there's no sound.

2894
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Whatsoever.

2895
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Anyway, just a couple more stories for you guys,

2896
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:20,000
and then we'll take your loud phone calls over on Skype at Orange Launch Radio.

2897
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Logie?

2898
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
So, it's that time.

2899
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,000
The time when all of your modern systems get emulated.

2900
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,000
And what system is next on the list?

2901
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Why, of course, it's a Nintendo Switch.

2902
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:37,000
So apparently there's this emulator called the Yuzu emulator

2903
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:41,000
that has managed to run Super Mario Odyssey

2904
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:44,000
completely through the whole game.

2905
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
So, it does work in the emulator.

2906
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Granted, there are some graphical glitches and some slowdowns,

2907
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:53,000
but it is playable, and you can play from the beginning to the end.

2908
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:57,000
And they even have a way where you can download the patches and everything.

2909
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:03,000
So, pretty far progress considering that this is the first I'm hearing of it.

2910
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:08,000
So, I'm definitely on board with seeing what they're gonna do with this.

2911
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Of course, no good things, obviously.

2912
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,000
It's gonna be modded like crazy.

2913
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Balzette's gonna be in here in like a matter of time.

2914
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Just matter of...

2915
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Just gotta wait.

2916
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,000
The TTB.

2917
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Joy.

2918
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Did you hear that Nintendo confirmed this week, by the way,

2919
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,000
that that hat can't be used on any other characters?

2920
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:34,000
It can only be used on Toadette.

2921
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Or, what is it? No.

2922
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Yeah, the hat is only used on Toadette to make Peach Hat.

2923
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
You can't use it on other characters.

2924
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:44,000
So, just so you know, everybody, Nintendo has officially confirmed

2925
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Balzette is not canon.

2926
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
So, please remove her from the internet now.

2927
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,000
You were wrong.

2928
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:52,000
And I am going to point out why you're wrong.

2929
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Because in an official art book for Super Mario Odyssey,

2930
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Nintendo actually, before the internet came up with Balzette,

2931
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
came up with Balzette.

2932
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
It's already a thing. It's already canon.

2933
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,000
It's already canon.

2934
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Yes, but then it was deleted as all of your accounts ought to be.

2935
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Just saying.

2936
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Dartetsuya in chat says,

2937
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Switch emulators already?

2938
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:22,000
I mean, I guess I'm not surprised, but I'll stick with my official hardware.

2939
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Yeah, it could be risky.

2940
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Probably gonna be very buggy, too.

2941
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:29,000
And Rama in chat, in reference to my Balzette hating, says,

2942
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Dear Rob Roberts, we will reject your false notions.

2943
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I don't know, though.

2944
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Honestly, though, the emulators that run Wii U games and stuff

2945
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
run them better than the Wii U.

2946
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I can't see that this wouldn't be that difficult to...

2947
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,000
I mean, yeah, it's probably not running great right now

2948
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
because they haven't optimized a ton of stuff.

2949
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:52,000
But it will get there, I think.

2950
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:57,000
And then we'll have 4K Mario Odyssey and modded craziness.

2951
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Alright, well, one more story for you guys.

2952
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
And chatters behave. Stop dragging me.

2953
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Because this is a serious one to end on, this note tonight.

2954
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
The inspiration, or I should say the namesake,

2955
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
maybe not totally the inspiration,

2956
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
but the namesake for Nintendo's Mario character

2957
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:14,000
actually passed away this week at the age of 84.

2958
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Mario Segal? I hope I said that name right.

2959
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:20,000
S-E-G-A-L-E? Segal?

2960
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Mario Segal actually passed away this week, again, at the age of 84.

2961
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Passed away on October 27th.

2962
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Who was he? He was not a plumber.

2963
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,000
He developed office buildings and malls in Washington state.

2964
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:34,000
He actually sold this all in 1998 for about 60 million.

2965
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:39,000
In the year 1981, he was renting a warehouse to Nintendo of America.

2966
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
And Miyamoto created the Mario character,

2967
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:44,000
but of course originally the name of the character was Jumpman.

2968
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
And then the girlfriend was Lady.

2969
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Well, at some point, Nintendo wanted proper names,

2970
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:53,000
so they named the hero Mario after this landlord.

2971
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:58,000
And then Pauline was actually named after a wife of a Nintendo of America employee.

2972
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
So that is where the name came from.

2973
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Believe it or not.

2974
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,000
He apparently rejected his connection to the Mario franchise

2975
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:08,000
because he thought it might harm his business ventures.

2976
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,000
In a 1993 interview with the Seattle Times, he just said,

2977
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:15,000
you might say I'm still waiting for my royalty checks.

2978
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Regardless, it sounds like Mario may not have been named Mario

2979
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:23,000
if it wasn't for him, so whether he likes it or not,

2980
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:26,000
I suppose he's forever a part of that video game canon.

2981
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:29,000
But interesting to know that Mario, the name,

2982
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
had nothing to do with a plumber or any of that other stuff

2983
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:35,000
that goes with the lore behind the Mario character.

2984
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:38,000
In chat at live.vognetwork.com, D'Artesia says,

2985
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:42,000
I mean, just think about different things would be if it weren't for him.

2986
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,000
That's right. I mean, if the real estate developer had been named something else

2987
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:49,000
or they decided to name it after another character, I mean, Mario is iconic.

2988
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Mario is a Mickey Mouse for this generation.

2989
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Like, everybody knows Mario.

2990
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:57,000
If you're, you know, under a certain age, even if you're over a certain age,

2991
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
you still probably know who Mario is.

2992
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:04,000
S200Matt says, this is like Spielberg naming the shark in Jaws Bruce

2993
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,000
after his lawyer. I'm not so sure that was a compliment, though.

2994
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Tigerclaw wants to know, where did the name Luigi come from?

2995
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Good question. It wasn't really addressed in the Mario story,

2996
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:17,000
so I'm not sure where Luigi came from, but I'm sure,

2997
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
got to be out there on the internet somewhere.

2998
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
If you can weed your way through all the Bowsette photos,

2999
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
you can probably figure out where that came from.

3000
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I'm pretty curious, too.

3001
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Dark Tetsuya says, oh, check out the brain on Dark Tetsuya.

3002
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Dark Tetsuya says, his name is a Japanese pun on the word for similar,

3003
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:35,000
since he's similar to Mario's sprite in Mario Brothers.

3004
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Clever. And if you think about it, Luigi wasn't in Donkey Kong.

3005
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
They didn't have to name him when they named Mario,

3006
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,000
so he was named later, probably when they did the Mario Brothers game,

3007
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
which would have been after Donkey Kong,

3008
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:51,000
because there was no Luigi in Donkey Kong, so food for thought.

3009
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Anyway, our Skype line is open, if you want to give us a call.

3010
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, to give us a call on Skype for the night,

3011
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
and we can talk about Diablo, I guess.

3012
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:02,000
If you want to talk about Bowsette, we can, although I'd rather not.

3013
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
We can talk about whatever you want over at Orange Lounge Radio,

3014
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
all one word on Skype.

3015
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:10,000
While we wait for our phone to ring, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?

3016
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Yeah, so the Nintendo Switch has reached 22.86 million units sold

3017
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:19,000
that's surpassing the GameCube lifetime sales,

3018
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,000
so that's pretty good in comparison, of course.

3019
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:31,000
The 3DS is 73.5 million units, and the Wii U 13.56 million units.

3020
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,000
We have a call coming in. Let's get to it.

3021
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
I'm going to pick up the phone here.

3022
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:39,000
By the way, we did get a reprieve on the Skype thing.

3023
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Skype is still working on Windows XP.

3024
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:46,000
I guess Microsoft pushed back the time to pull the plug for whatever reason.

3025
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Anyway, I think we are there.

3026
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3027
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3028
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Not working. Try calling without the video.

3029
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
I think the video is slowing you down.

3030
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

3031
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Sorry about that, Loki. Do you have something else to put in there?

3032
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Speaking of numbers, PlayStation 4 shipped 86.1 million units worldwide.

3033
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
That's a lot of PlayStations.

3034
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
That is a lot of PlayStation, yeah.

3035
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Their gaming revenue is up 27%. Profit up 65%, so don't let them tell you that they don't have enough money.

3036
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Because they are making plenty of it.

3037
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Alright, I'm going to try this call again and see if it comes through.

3038
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3039
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Hi, this is Rachael. Sorry about that.

3040
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
I have connection problems over on my end.

3041
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Apparently. That's alright, though. We got you now.

3042
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
What's up, buddy? What's on your mind tonight?

3043
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Yeah, well, granted, I'm a little late to the show. Sorry about that. I had all the commitments, but...

3044
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
I see how it is.

3045
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Yeah, well, sometimes real life happens. But seriously, though...

3046
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
We are your life now.

3047
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Well, I could say something, but I'm trying to keep this radio appropriate.

3048
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Yeah, good idea. Good idea.

3049
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Yeah, good idea.

3050
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
But seriously, though...

3051
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Since you were talking about the PlayStation Classic that will be coming out this holiday...

3052
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
I have a question for you.

3053
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Do you see yourself picking this up, or do you see yourself passing it out?

3054
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:31,000
And whatever your answer is, please explain either way.

3055
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Yes, sir. I think I did kind of mention it earlier, but I'll just reiterate.

3056
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:41,000
My plan is to pass on this, and the reason why is that I'm a little burned out on all the classic consoles.

3057
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:49,000
I think it's a little ridiculous that the PlayStation 4 just won't play the PlayStation 1 games that I still have in the case, ready to go, to play on it.

3058
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:55,000
And I realize something can be said about, you know, well, then why would you buy an NES Classic when you have Nintendo games?

3059
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Which, I mean, I suppose is fair, but at the same time, those, you know, at that time, to buy the little NES Classic, the SNES Classic, those were super cute as well.

3060
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:11,000
And I'm not saying the PlayStation Classic isn't cute, but they did make some questionable design choices, such as omitting the DualShock, such as charging $100 for 20 games.

3061
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Sorry, but I don't think these games are worth that price tag that they're putting out.

3062
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:21,000
So, kind of all those things together does it in for me. But you know what I did pay money for? I should point this out.

3063
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:30,000
So, my little collection that I have of these classic arcade games, right? I picked up this BurgerTime one. I mentioned that a couple weeks ago, because that's like a fancier one, right?

3064
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:38,000
I picked up two brand new ones at $35 a pop. I just haven't put them out yet. I wonder if Alan just went in the other room and grabbed them. I don't know.

3065
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Oh, yes, he did. He's bringing them in the studio now. So, the two new ones I just bought this week and were Mappy, which I thought was pretty cool, that there's one for that, and Dig Dug.

3066
02:24:48,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Dig Dug is kind of that 80s game that I'm actually okay at. I can actually play it quite a bit. So, Alan wants to give some input on all of this. Apparently, my classic gaming collection hobby. Yes, Alan?

3067
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:08,000
The one thing that I dislike about the new series is that they're slightly bigger than the series one and two, so they don't look like they belong.

3068
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:13,000
They're different companies. They're not the same. Like, they're not the same companies making them. So, that's why.

3069
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,000
I retract my statement.

3070
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Okay. Oh, wait, wait. Before you run away. Before you run away, why don't you answer our caller's question? Would you buy the PlayStation Classic for $100? Why or why not?

3071
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:28,000
I would. Just, I mean, I would.

3072
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
No, you will not.

3073
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:40,000
I would need a lot of, like, a windfall of money where I would buy something that frivolous, but I'm not, like, offended by what the plan is or what the games are on it or anything.

3074
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Okay. All right. Loki, what's your perspective on that? Thanks for stopping by. Loki?

3075
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:56,000
I don't know if I have an extra $100 to dump on that, and also besides, I, like, I bought, well, first off, I bought a Coleco, a ColecoVision, one of the plug and play classic things. I haven't used it.

3076
02:25:56,000 --> 02:26:08,000
I bought an SNES classic. I've hardly used it. So, buying this again would be, like, I probably won't use it. That's why I probably wouldn't buy one. I do want one so it can hack it, but that's about all I want.

3077
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Interesting verbiage from Bobby Blackwolf in our chat who says, I'm skipping on the PlayStation Classic because I don't have the emotional connection to the system.

3078
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Right, and that's the other thing, too. It's, like, honestly, like, it's really easy to emulate PlayStation 1 games. You can do it, and it will look-

3079
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
It's easier to emulate NES games.

3080
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
It's incredibly easy, yes.

3081
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:34,000
But yet, I don't know. I don't know. Well, RageNator, do we give you what you were looking for? What's your opinion on it all?

3082
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Yeah, well, I'm tempted to give one, you know, because I do have the emotional connection. I did have PlayStation 1 way back in the day. In fact, you know, I got mine back in April of 97, you know, a couple weeks after I got N64.

3083
02:26:53,000 --> 02:27:06,000
And a lot of the games that you listed, I do have played, you know, some I haven't played, so there's that. You know, I at least want to try them at least once, at least the ones I haven't played.

3084
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:20,000
However, the key thing is, now this is coming out holiday time. You mentioned there's a $100 purchase, not including sales tax. And my budget for Christmas is extremely limited.

3085
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Sure.

3086
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I'm just barely able to save up $200 for Christmas, and every single last cent is already spoken for in terms of buying Christmas presents. In fact, one of which is going to cost me like $120. So that's a lot of money that's being spent on Christmas presents.

3087
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Well, someone's getting spoiled.

3088
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Yeah, I'm not saying who, and-

3089
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
And in our business, it's fine.

3090
02:27:49,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Yeah, and what the present is, that's $120, because that kind of thing is kind of inappropriate to mention on stream, but it's, let's just say it's one of those gifts.

3091
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Alright, okay.

3092
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Yeah, I know no one else can see me but Rob, but I'm using air quotes around those gifts.

3093
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
I'm looking away right now.

3094
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Yeah, so you can probably use your imagination right there.

3095
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:28,000
No, I won't be using my imagination on that whatsoever. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners, Rageator, before I let you go?

3096
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Nah, I'm all set, but thanks for taking my call.

3097
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Hey, you're welcome.

3098
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:42,000
I'll try to catch your next show and Bobby's show next week, and it's entirely assuming that the real-life plans don't happen.

3099
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Well, there's always the podcast, that's what it's for, so you can listen to it when it's convenient for you and your busy life.

3100
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Yeah, well, have a nice night.

3101
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,000
You too, take care, buddy.

3102
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Alright, Skype's lighting up tonight, we gotta get to another call here, so I'm gonna pick up another call on the line and get to it.

3103
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3104
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Ah, excellent, this is Zormay. How are you guys doing?

3105
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Hi, are you a first-time caller? I don't recognize the name.

3106
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:13,000
No, it's not. Sky, I spoke a few times over the last ten years.

3107
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Okay, so it's just a long-time dormant, we'll say then.

3108
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:25,000
I mean, sort of. I do have been able to keep up with you guys because of Twitter and Facebook.

3109
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:31,000
I actually remembered that you guys were on because you tweeted about it, and I'm actively on Twitter myself.

3110
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Hooray, social networking works! Yay! Pipping my shit on social media all the time. Awesome.

3111
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Great.

3112
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Oh, you're right, I do recognize the name. Bobby had to spell it out for me in chat. I do remember your name, I sure do.

3113
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:46,000
So, what's on your mind? What do we owe the phone call to tonight?

3114
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Actually, you know, I'm just really happy to see you guys still on the air and talking about the things that you love, and I enjoy it.

3115
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:02,000
I'm a big DDR fan, I actually am in the process of trying to get myself my own machine.

3116
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Oh!

3117
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Yeah.

3118
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Now you know that's something Loki recently did.

3119
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:17,000
You see, that's the whole thing. I wish that if Loki could probably give me any pointers on picking out one and keeping up with it, I'm really looking for that.

3120
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Well, Loki, how did you find your machine? What's the upkeep been like for you?

3121
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:36,000
I just kept checking different places, like eBay, there's a buy-sell-trade Facebook group that you can become a part of that sometimes people will sell machines.

3122
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Craigslist, I got lucky with Facebook Marketplace, someone just was dumping a machine, the guy was a collector and he didn't really play DDR too much, he just wanted to get rid of the machine, so I got it really cheap.

3123
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:58,000
And because he was trying to clear it out to me, because he's like, to be honest, I just want to get rid of this so I can get four more machines that can fit in the space that this one machine was in.

3124
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Because he had like three rooms in his house in the garage that was also full of arcade games.

3125
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,000
So he was getting rid of that in like a Gauntlet Legends, which is like, ooh, Gauntlet.

3126
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:14,000
But that's how I got lucky there. And as far as upkeep, really all I've done is like cleaned the pads.

3127
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:26,000
I lucked out, I don't know if it's lucky or not, but like I have it, it's an LCD screen in there, so it's like an LCD TV and not the original CRT screens, so I know there's a lot more upkeep with those.

3128
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Granted, the images stretch a little bit, but that's not going to be a problem when I put StepMania in there at some point or if I manage to hack in one of the newer arcade games.

3129
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:45,000
But as far as like the upkeep and stuff, it's like I did go through and clean the pads out because they were pretty dirty.

3130
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Apparently the machine had come from the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk at some point.

3131
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:56,000
I was trying to find like old video to see if I could find where it was, but that's where they claim it came from.

3132
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:05,000
It was a third Korean at some point and got upgraded to an Extreme. And so it was dirty. It had lots of beach sand in there.

3133
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:11,000
And so I've cleaned out one side of the pads. I didn't clean out the other side yet, which I probably should do.

3134
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Well, if you're going to be inviting me over, you better clean that up.

3135
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Well, the only reason I could clean out the first side, because the first side was missing like crazy. The second side played just fine.

3136
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:24,000
So I was like, oh, I'm just going to clean out this one side and it's never got around to doing the other one.

3137
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:38,000
I also need to get surface mount screws on there so that everything's inset and not sticking out, because I trip myself on those screws quite often.

3138
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Ah, that could be painful.

3139
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:44,000
So can you remind me again, what mix did you have? You have Extreme, right?

3140
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
I have Extreme, yeah.

3141
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:52,000
OK. And I'm pretty sure you actually have it shipped from California. So I'm on the East Coast.

3142
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Well, I lucked out. I didn't have to ship it. The guy was local to me. He was like maybe 10 minutes away.

3143
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:03,000
So I just grabbed the U-Haul and I had a couple of friends help me get in there.

3144
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:08,000
So I got really lucky when I didn't have it shipped because shipping would be pretty expensive.

3145
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:16,000
But yeah, I kind of lucked out. It's hard to find new machines out there.

3146
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:23,000
I mean, honestly, like I was almost going to build my own because it might end up being cheaper that route.

3147
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:31,000
But I don't know. You can do like even like if you get like, well, the step mania step maniacs pads are pretty expensive.

3148
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Like I think they're a thousand bucks or something. But wow. You can if if you're willing to pay that, you can just get a LCD TV and mount it.

3149
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
And then that's about the machine right there.

3150
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:46,000
OK. I've seen some because I actually use the Sows Network, the money.

3151
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:56,000
So you guys know about that. But, you know, on there, they told me that there's actually a possibly get newer versions like we can get like to DDR 2014.

3152
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:04,000
And, you know, and there's a guy that talks about how he can help me set it up. But it's just like it's a hit or miss about the newer ones.

3153
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:09,000
And they have a lot of older ones, like five hundred, six hundred dollars roughly about the extreme.

3154
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:14,000
And they just said that you might have to fix it. And I don't know too much about like going into it, fixing it.

3155
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:19,000
Like I have the the private server, you know, to kind of play beat mania.

3156
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I have like the program world. But over here, you know, by Chinatown Fair, they actually had the people who actually installed it in the machines over there.

3157
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:32,000
So but like getting the machine as I'm thinking about shipping.

3158
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:39,000
So I'm glad that you let me know a little bit about that. I'll see what how it is on the East Coast.

3159
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Shipping is probably going to be a few hundred dollars just because they have to pallet it and everything.

3160
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:52,000
I mean, the machines themselves, they're not too heavy because they're on wheels for the most part.

3161
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:59,000
I mean, so it was pretty it was pretty easy just to get it in and out of U-Haul for me.

3162
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:06,000
I mean, well, my actual my plan is I don't know about over on the West Coast, but well, it is over there as well.

3163
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:13,000
But you've heard of like TaskRabbit. Yeah, I think I've heard of it.

3164
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Yeah. So there's like a way you can people you just hire people on demand and they'll help you move things and fix stuff and and whatnot.

3165
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:29,000
So that's my actual plan for the lifting because I have to live on the second floor in like in Brooklyn here in New York.

3166
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:34,000
So that's like one of the things I'm really interested in because I can at least get the help for that.

3167
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:40,000
But the actual fixing of it or maybe I was like I was hoping that maybe there was some sort of like I know there's a wiki out there somewhere.

3168
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:46,000
But, you know, it's making sure they're up to date and dated. You know, I might I'm a fan extreme.

3169
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:51,000
I might just do extreme. So but I think that's that's all. That's all I basically thanks a lot for that.

3170
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:57,000
No worries, buddy. And it's good to hear from you. And best of luck in your hunt to chase down a DDR machine.

3171
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:04,000
And I hope when you get one that you don't, you know, ruin your relationship with your downstairs neighbors.

3172
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:09,000
You may want to talk to you may want to talk to Rama in our chat room because he says, yo, I know people in Brooklyn.

3173
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:15,000
So, oh, yeah, I definitely will. I'll hit up the chat. All right.

3174
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:19,000
Sounds good. Well, take care, my friend. Thanks for the call. All right. Take care. Yep. Bye bye.

3175
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:27,000
Orange launch radio, all one word on Skype. We can probably squeeze in one more call before we call the night here at Orange launch radio.

3176
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:33,000
So get those phones ringing. Did you have any other last minute stories you want to sneak in here? Yeah, this is kind of interesting.

3177
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:39,000
I completely forgot this is coming up, but apparently this coming up weekend is inside Xbox XO 18.

3178
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Oh, yeah. Isn't that like in Mexico City or something? I believe so. Yeah. So that's going to be coming up this weekend.

3179
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:50,000
So I guess we'll have some news. They say they run three to five p.m. central time.

3180
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:57,000
They're going to have this inside Xbox. It's going to be taking place at 18 central time on Saturday.

3181
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:02,000
So three to five central. So I have to check it out and see what they're going to announce.

3182
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Do you think? Yeah, I was going to say, do you think they're going to be any big announcements or do you think Xbox classic?

3183
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:16,000
That would be weird. I mean, neat. But yeah, I don't think they would do that because they have backwards compatibility.

3184
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:21,000
They're not stupid like some of the other. Yeah. All right. All right.

3185
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Well, let's get one more call in here. And I'm sorry to those that aren't going to get through tonight.

3186
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:29,000
But, you know, you can always email us. Hi, you're on Orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on?

3187
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:37,000
It is Ron. Hey, Ron. What's on your mind, buddy? Not too much. I guess I do have like the quick trigger finger to get onto the Skype line.

3188
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Yes. Yes. You beat out thousands of others to get through once again. I'm just kidding. What's on your mind, though?

3189
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Couple of things. Number one. Yeah, I'm still waiting on Sony to announce backwards compatibility of PS one and PS two games in the PlayStation.

3190
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Don't hold your breath. Yeah, keep it. I know. I know. But I'm finally going to get one because Target's going to have the one terabyte console for 200 bucks.

3191
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Hmm. OK, so because, you know, Black Friday deals are leaking left and right. And I said that's the only way I'm getting next gen consoles.

3192
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:12,000
If they're 200 bucks on Black Friday and I'm glad I got my Xbox one last year. Yeah, that is a pretty darn good deal.

3193
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:26,000
I got to say. So don't blame me there. And the second thing, I know you hate this whole Bowser thing, but you got this.

3194
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:35,000
I have this amazing cosplay group I'm putting together for a con next year. I'm going to tell you and I think you're going to like it.

3195
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:42,000
I can't wait to not see pictures. No, I'm just kidding. What is it? Oh, we're going to be doing selfies on the mixture. I send them to you.

3196
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Oh, boy. All right. So we're going to have to my friends are twins are going to be Bowser and booing.

3197
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:59,000
And through some convincing, I am doing a modification of a Ghostbusters jumpsuit as Luigi.

3198
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:04,000
OK, so you will be trapping Boozette live during the convention?

3199
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Probably so. And we're going to play off the supposed quote unquote relationship between Buette and Luigi, because what I see is this.

3200
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Buette sees Luigi as her boyfriend and Luigi has no fucking clue as to this.

3201
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:26,000
You cosplayers have so much fucking time on your hands to invent these stories. All of this shipping going on.

3202
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:29,000
Nothing but love. Nothing but love. I'm just being a bitch.

3203
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Oh, you should see the Gundam Wing fandom. That's a story for another time.

3204
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Bobby Black Wolf suggests to do Pea Chowser, not Bowsette. And then that way you trick me.

3205
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Well, only half my cosplay friends. That could happen. But I talked to Mako Char.

3206
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:53,000
She's going to join in. She's going into a variant of Daisy based off of Janine Melanin from the animated series.

3207
02:39:53,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Now, see, when you told me that I would be into it, I thought you'd be like, I know all these like shirtless gay dudes who are going to be doing like Bowsette.

3208
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:04,000
But like as male without shirts on, I'd be like, OK, well, you can send me that.

3209
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:09,000
I do have a dude dressed up as Bowsette I saw over the weekend. I can send you pictures of that.

3210
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:15,000
All right. We got my number. Area code 916. I'm just going to give my phone number out on her.

3211
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:20,000
I also have some shirtless cross play Sailor Moon dudes for you as well.

3212
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:24,000
All right. Well, that's right of Allen's alley. Allen loves Sailor Moon.

3213
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Someone needs the cosplay Bowsette, but the Dennis Hopper Bowser.

3214
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:35,000
See that I might have to get someone to do that as well. Now, that's funny.

3215
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:40,000
By the way, since since Rama brought up Ghostbusters, I forgot to say, you know, they have that Ghostbusters game.

3216
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:44,000
That's kind of like the takeoff on Pokemon Go that came out. I played that a little bit this week.

3217
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:48,000
It uses the AR stuff like you have to like put a trap on the ground.

3218
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:52,000
It doesn't it's not like throwing a ball. They didn't try to copy that thing for Pokemon Go.

3219
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:56,000
So they made like a whole different type of capture thing with the Ghostbusters thing.

3220
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:00,000
So I thought Rama reminded me of that. I did play that because, you know what, Loki?

3221
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Once in a while, I'll just try a mobile game that sounds remotely interesting because it's free.

3222
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:10,000
And because you have a phone. Because I have a phone. Don't you have a phone?

3223
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
I do have a phone.

3224
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:16,000
That's it. Thank you, Tigerclaw. Ghostbusters World. That's the name of it.

3225
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Don't you have a phone, Rama? I haven't heard it yet. Don't you have a phone?

3226
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Yes, I have a phone.

3227
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:26,000
I know. I'm just saying. It's the question we're all asking each other this week.

3228
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:31,000
I just upgraded my phone so now I can actually download and play more games.

3229
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Oh, there you go.

3230
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:37,000
I have about 20 games on my phone and I sit there, I play Sailor Moon and drops all damn day.

3231
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:41,000
You and my husband both. Jesus. All right.

3232
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Well, Rama, I'm going to wrap up and let you go. But any other quick final thoughts for our listeners?

3233
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:53,000
I agree with Bobby Blackwolf about the retro consoles. I mean, honestly, I'm not buying into the PlayStation Classic.

3234
02:41:53,000 --> 02:42:02,000
I can't see myself doing it. I mean, honestly, I'd rather track down a PS1, mod it, download the iCells and play it.

3235
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:06,000
And that will probably be a lot cheaper than buying a classic. Just saying.

3236
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:11,000
Yeah, I know. Well, you know, Sony would prefer you didn't do it that way.

3237
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:15,000
But then, you know what? As far as I'm concerned, Sony could have released those things on PlayStation 4.

3238
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Let me use my PlayStation 1 disc. It's getting a little silly.

3239
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Yes. I mean, Microsoft lets you. Come on, Sony. Who are you kidding, fam? Who are you kidding?

3240
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:26,000
You can't ride the Spider-Man train forever.

3241
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:30,000
I know. All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go. Have a good one. Thank you for the call, though.

3242
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:33,000
Hey, no problem. You take care, bros. You too. Bye.

3243
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:37,000
And I think with that, I am going to go ahead and wrap up. I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through.

3244
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:42,000
But remember, you can always email us. Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com and I would definitely encourage you to do that.

3245
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:47,000
But we are going to wrap up here in studio tonight. That was a fun show. Thank you, Loki, as always, for being here.

3246
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:50,000
And thank you, listeners, as always, for being here.

3247
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Because again, we do tape live on Sunday nights at the Voice Heats Network, vognetwork.com.

3248
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:58,000
But I know many of you listen to us through our podcast feed and we are very thankful for that.

3249
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:03,000
Because the live experience is going to be changing very, very soon. I would say within the next six weeks.

3250
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
We're going to be making that big move to Twitch.

3251
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:09,000
And for those of you on the podcast feed, though, nothing's going to change. So don't worry about it.

3252
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Just maybe the audio will kind of sound a little different because we'll be recording it a little differently, hopefully on some newer equipment.

3253
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:19,000
And then we are going to be making a hosting change behind the scenes. But again, all that shouldn't really affect you guys.

3254
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:22,000
We do appreciate you guys listening to our show every week and supporting Orange Launch Radio.

3255
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Thank you, as always. Whether you've been listening for all 15, 16 years or you just started listening last week, we appreciate you being here.

3256
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Please help us spread the word. Tell a friend or two about our show.

3257
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only air the voices that are here to basically be aired.

3258
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:43,000
So that's that. Now we'll get everybody's final thought.

3259
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:47,000
Oh, I always say a quick five star review on a place like iTunes and all that goes a long way.

3260
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:50,000
I've said that enough and we never seem to get new ones anyway.

3261
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:53,000
But I'll say it again because you never know. Maybe this will be the week.

3262
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Anyway, final thoughts time. It's time to get everybody's final thought.

3263
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Loki, you want to go first? What's your final thought tonight?

3264
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:05,000
I forgot to mention, well, I looked at this earlier this week, but Humble Bundle right now has another PlayStation 4 deal that's coming right now.

3265
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

3266
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
THQ games, so if you're interested in that.

3267
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:11,000
Giana Sisters could be had for a dollar and Lock's Quest.

3268
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:15,000
Oh, shit. Well, Giana Sisters, they gave away on the Xbox Gold a while ago.

3269
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Right.

3270
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
But, I mean, for charity, for a dollar.

3271
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Yeah, really.

3272
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:27,000
You know, they have This Is The Police, The Dwarves, Red Faction 2, Black Mirror, and Destroy All Humans 2 for $12.28, which is the BP average and $15.

3273
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Titan Quest, Darksiders, War Master Edition, Cinamori, EXEN, Battle Chasers, Night War.

3274
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:36,000
That's a lot of stuff. That's a lot of games.

3275
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Yeah, a lot of games.

3276
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:38,000
I like my deals.

3277
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
I think I have a lot of these already, though.

3278
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:41,000
We'll see.

3279
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:42,000
That's it.

3280
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Alright.

3281
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:49,000
And then my final thought is, so I didn't talk about this during my gaming week, but you know I play those online reality games.

3282
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
I was playing another one recently.

3283
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Guess what? Guess what, Loki? Guess what?

3284
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
I was playing a Big Brother one online. Guess what happened?

3285
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:56,000
You got voted out?

3286
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
You got voted out before the jury again.

3287
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:04,000
I'm the biggest flop in these things, but yet I still continue to play.

3288
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:08,000
Alright, anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Challenge Radio.

3289
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show and supporting it.

3290
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:12,000
We appreciate you guys.

3291
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
And we will see you next time, next week.

3292
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:15,000
We'll do it all again next week, right?

3293
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:18,000
Next week's show is going to have to last us two weeks, though, so we've got to make it extra good.

3294
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:21,000
So we'll see you here in seven days to do it all over again.

3295
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Thank you again for listening.

3296
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Have a great week.

3297
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Happy gaming.

3298
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:28,000
