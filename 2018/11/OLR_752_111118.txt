Orange Lounge Radio
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
Tonight, things go away such as upcoming DLC for one major game and a publisher of video game guides
But there are new releases on the way too and we will talk about all that and more on this week on the show where every gamer has a voice
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight episode number 752 for this November the 11th of 2018
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you in studio with my co-host, Techmaster Loki
How are you?
I'm fine
Good, good to have you back here
It's gonna be our last show for two weeks, well yeah cause we won't be here next week
So this is the Thanksgiving special I suppose
Although we will be here the Sunday after Thanksgiving which will pretty much be right after the Black Friday holiday
Steam sale
Supposedly
All sales
All the sales really
Well what's interesting is that usually that's the point in the year where like okay that's it
All the video games are out for the year, they're all out now
Not this year
Not this year, no you're right because especially Smash Ultimate is probably like the huge exception
And the same day
And
The same day as Smash Ultimate
Is
Earth Defense Wars 5
Oh how could I forget, you're absolutely right, Earth Defense Wars 5 is also coming out that same day
Not here tonight in studio, Dark Soccer or JB Summers, she is still on a work conflict for a little while
She will be joining us through Radio Magic later in the show
Of course you guys are joining us in our chat room as you do every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
When we tape live at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
We tape of course Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
And if you are listening to us live, you can join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
And as I mentioned there a little programming note, we will not be here next Sunday
I will be in Las Vegas or actually on Sunday I will be coming back from Las Vegas
Having just attended the Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest for the year 2018
This is, it's kinda like Blizzcon
But for the other MMO that a lot of people play, Final Fantasy IV
Actually I should, there's plenty of MMOs that lots of people play
But Final Fantasy XIV is another big one and it's one that I've been playing pretty much
I played the 1.0 version of the game ok, I suffered through the 1.0 version of the game
But my love of the online Final Fantasies goes back to Final Fantasy XI
Which Loki and I used to play as well
Do you still get the emails begging you to come back to Final Fantasy XI?
No
Oh they just, they're showing up on my Instagram
Final Fantasy XI is like advertising on Instagram
And they're doing some big campaign right now and I didn't even see all the details
If I wanna know the details
I would love to come back to Final Fantasy XI
If they make it free
Where is Final Fantasy XI that I can come back to? Isn't it not online anymore?
No it is, it's been online for PC
You cannot connect anymore on Playstation or Xbox 360
They took off that support, it's only PC
I thought they shut the whole thing down
No, it's only, no
The PC version is still going, I have a friend that still plays it
So it's still there
And they still add to it
They're still doing little things here and there
I mean, since they use basically a made up language
They'll talk about all these new zones
And I'm like, I have no idea what that word means
But sounds cool, go off I guess
So yeah, so
But this Fan Fest I'm going to in Vegas has nothing to do with XI
It's all about XIV which, you know, I do enjoy
I've been on a little bit of a hiatus from XIV
Just because I kinda, I don't really do the raiding
I don't do a lot of the endgame progression that other people do
So I'm just kind of in a lull right now
But that's why I'm excited to go to this event
Because it will be inevitably announcing next year's expansion
Because it's a very obvious pattern now
And not only that, but they'll probably get to, you know, do some special fights on the computer
Special stuff and there'll be some panels
And most of all, most importantly, concerts
So they're doing the two concerts again
So they're going to have a piano concert one night
And then they're going to have the Primals
Which is the band fronted by Soken
Who does the music of Final Fantasy XIV
And even if you don't play Final Fantasy XIV
Even if you have no interest in MMOs
Seriously, go listen to some of the soundtrack songs of Final Fantasy XIV
Because it's amazing
And Soken has done a great job
So his band will be there with that concert
So I'm just excited to just take that all in
And some other friends of mine are going to be there
It'll be good
Anyway, we're going to get into tonight's kickoff topic here in a moment
Which is also about Final Fantasy
First I want to address a couple of things that don't have anything to do with video games
But I think they're important to say
First of all, happy Veterans Day
I think that's very important
Because I know we have plenty of veterans that listen to Orange on Triadio
So I just want to say thank you for what you do
And your service
And defending our right to have this show
To have our lame ass opinions
And the freedom of speech that everybody defends out there
Working hard in our military
So happy Veterans Day to all of you
The other thing I want to address is that
It's really smoky here in Sacramento
I went out last night and I had to wear a mask
Because of all this smoke that's everywhere
It's awfully inconvenient
But it's nothing compared to what's happening up the road a little bit
In the town of Paradise
Or, I can't even believe I'm saying this
What was the town of Paradise?
I don't know if you all know this
But if you've ever read my bio
On vogginetwork.com
I actually went to Chico State for a few years
And I was involved with radio up there
So Chico is kind of like the larger town in California
Let's be real, when you go north of Sacramento
In San Francisco, there isn't a lot
From here to the border
It's a very different California
It's the red woody part of California
It's very different from what you all might think of
If you haven't been to California before
So, Chico is one of the larger towns
Because it has the school
But I distinctly remember
I had an old roommate who used to fix computers
In the town of Paradise
And there was a road, you take the skyway
You go up the skyway, Paradise is this lovely town
That sits up on the hill
It's gorgeous views from up there
It's why they call it that
I do remember visiting the town
And having memories
I'm shocked
I'm in a state of OMG
Just hearing that the town is gone
And it's not just affecting Paradise
I'm hearing now
It's moved into Magalia
And some of the other cities up there
That I bet a lot of you probably don't know
Because they are smaller communities in California
But it's very, very, very, very scary
Obviously, this is not the only part of California
That's on fire right now
It's the one that is
I feel like I have a little bit of connection to it
Because I know a lot of people from those days
That are being affected by this
But certainly the town of Thousand Oaks
Experiencing multiple tragedies this week
I mean, we had the unspeakable event
That happened at the country western bar with a shooter
And then, now they're on fire too
And that's affecting Malibu
And I'm sure some of you guys have been hearing about that one
Because of the celebrities posting
That their homes are gone
It's crazy
It's so, so crazy
And I was really, really disappointed
You know, I don't like to get political on the show
And I like to keep it video games
But I was really disappointed
That our leader of this nation
Could not write
A humane tweet
About the situation
And instead felt the need to
Use it as an opportunity to attack California
When I believe over 90%
Of the forest land in California
Is actually federally overseen
So, congrats
You played yourself, jerk
But I was so mad about that
But anyway, again, I'm not
I promise I won't get political, so I'm just gonna swallow that thought
But it was just very
Very irritating to read about
But if you want to try to make a positive
About it, no matter where you're at politically
I would refer you to a page
I don't often do this
But it's just a great compilation
That one of our local television stations
Put together, because I don't want to tell you
To do one charity or the other charity
Everybody might have different ways to look into it
So, this is a shout out to one of our local
TV stations, but it's cbs13.com
Slash help
So, it's very easy to understand
URL as well, cbs13.com slash help
And if you see a charity in there that looks like
Something you could help out with
And help these folks up in Paradise
Megalia, the North State, and people that are facing
This, I think that would be
Really, really great
So, I just wanted to give a shout out to that
Okay, anyway, I had to get it off my chest
I know it doesn't have to do with video games
But, some things are a bigger deal
I heard some video of it was making
It's way around video game blogs
One of my friends was like, did you see the video on Kotaku
With the fire, and I was like
Why is it on Kotaku, but
I mean, these are things that impact us
All, gamers and non-gamers alike
Okay, let's shift gears, Loki
Let's talk about video games
Because that is the podcast you all signed up to hear
And when it is smoky outside
On a day like today, I know I
Sat in the house and I played video games all day
Which we'll talk about during my gaming week
But, some people might be
Playing games that are not going to have
Much DLC in the future, right, Loki?
Yeah, and this is one game that I've played
Like, ten minutes of and really needed to go back
To its own point, but I'm not doing that yet
So, Final Fantasy XV
They have announced
That three of the four upcoming pieces
Of DLC have been cancelled
And right now
The one that is
Remaining is going to be coming out
Looks like next year
And so, the one that's left
Is going to be the Arden
And that will be coming out March 2019
So, the
Ariane
What is it?
Arane, Luna and Noctis
Ariane, I think is how you say it
I don't remember, but yeah
Those are cancelled
And then along with that
They said
They're going to be releasing a short form
Anime called Final Fantasy XV
Episode Arden Prologue
And that's going to be coming out
Looks like they have
Teasers that are going to be coming out on December 15th
And it's going to release on
January 10th
And then
They've got a Final Fantasy
XV Multiplayer Comrades
Which is going to be coming out on
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
And that's on December 12th
The multiplayer has been out
This is some type of stand alone thing
And it's going to be
Some stand alone thing that will include new bosses
Costumes, weapons and what not
So, they have multiplayer in the game now?
I know, they patched it in a long time ago and I never bothered to check it out
Which might be part of the problem, but we'll get to that
And then of course
They said that there is going to be a collaboration with Final Fantasy XIV
Online
Adventurer from Another World
And that's going to be
Playable in Final Fantasy XV
I don't understand
How that's going to work, but that's on December 12th as well
Interesting, well I know
They did an event for Lightning Returns
In Final Fantasy XIV and Lightning shows up
In the world of XIV and you kind of work with her
In some fates and then
If you get enough points from participating
You can dress up exactly
I think for female characters
You get an outfit that looks just like Lightning
For male characters you get an outfit that looks like snow
So, yeah
That's what you got for participating
So imagine the XV crossover will be something similar in XIV
And then I don't know
If they'll put some of the bosses
In XV or what they're going to do
I don't know how that's going to work
But, I mean, still kind of a big deal
That these big DLC pieces
Are cancelled
And the guy left
He left Square Enix
The guy who had been designing all this
Has left
Which is a pretty big deal as well
Yeah, so
Hajime
Tabata
He had left
And he had taken over for Tetsuya
And Nomura back in 2013
He's gone though
Because Tetsuya Nomura is probably over on Kingdom Hearts 3 now
Cranking that out and then still has
The Final Fantasy VII remake to do after that
So I wonder if there was some sort of
Disagreement or something that caused him to leave
Well, the disagreement may be
That they were talking
What, like a $44 million loss
Or something like that on all this
I mean, it's pretty incredible
The hit
I don't know if it's specifically this
But Square Enix kind of took a hit
It seems like they're trying to recreate VII
Like the phenomenon that was VII
With all the spin-offs and everything
And it's just not ever getting to that level
Right
I have mixed feelings about this
Because I know XV has its fans
And I wouldn't even say I don't dislike XV
Honestly, in the
In the scope of all Final Fantasy
Games ever, XV is probably somewhere
In the middle of the pack for me
It's higher than VIII
It's higher than the original
NES trilogy, which I think it just
Those NES games were good
And they were important, but they're outshone
By what the technology
Of the later games can do
So I think I would rank it above some of those
But it's certainly not as good
As IV, VI, X
For me, I mean every
Critic is going to have their own list
Of how they rate the Final Fantasy games
And certainly I know
How I feel about VIII is extremely
Controversial, but
Yeah, XV I would say
Is somewhere in the middle of the pack, but
I think the thing that frustrates me
And what frustrated me about XV to begin with
Is that I bought the game
I played this game start to finish
For what it was, and then it was like
Oh hey, we're going to keep changing this game
But Final Fantasy
Was never this
Online persistent experience to me
Because it takes you
50 hours to beat this game
I don't know, it depends how fast you all play
But to hear them say, oh we're going to go back and change
Chapter 13, or whatever
Yeah, Chapter 13 was kind of
Busted and probably needed to be re-looked at
But I don't want to go back and
Just play that one chapter
And XV doesn't do anything for me
You know what I mean?
I'm not the biggest fan of
Editing these games massively
After they're released
And then XV just kind of continued to do that
With this model
I know some of the DLC was spin-off stuff
And that was fine
That's a way to do it
But I just felt like
In a way, and I think a lot of you kind of felt like this
Is that with Final Fantasy XV it was like
They were consistently adding to this game
They wanted to be there
When it actually released
But they weren't able to actually put in the game
Because they were forced to put the game out by a certain time
Because it had been in development for so long
Although we all know
That game's real development was only like
The last two or three years of the cycle
You know what I mean?
Especially if you go back and look at the original Versus 13 trailer
It is very clear
Things were scrapped, things were changed
And probably when this creative change happened
The entire thing was scrapped and redone
Which, you know
Kind of goes back to
Just sometimes how the big business
End of things can really screw things up
And it's what really ticked me off about the Mass Effect franchise too
Now what's weird
Is that with the Mass Effect franchise
I kind of wish they would have been able to do some DLC
But the DLC in Mass Effect
Would have been different
Like it would have been after the game
They wouldn't have been trying to go back and change the game in progress
And when they started to do that
Which, by the way, they started to do in Mass Effect Andromeda
Was go back and change all this shit about the game in progress
I lost interest completely
I was like, here we go again
The game I bought is not the game they wanted to put out
They're going back and changing everything in the middle
You know what, I'll go back and play it in the year
When it's actually done
And unfortunately that attitude
Across the board with a lot of people
Probably helped that game to flop
And now they're not going to do the Corian DLC
And you know that game is not remembered fondly
But in my opinion
EA fucking hosed that game
By forcing them to release it when they did
I know that game would have been in development for a long time
But again, I think the real development cycle
Was really towards the end of it
And it needed six more months in the oven
And we would have had a different story here
I think
Yeah
But um
What else did I want to say about Final Fantasy XV?
Then I'll look at our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com
But with Final Fantasy XV
It's just like
In a way, I'm kind of
I don't want to say I'm happy in this news
At all, because I don't want to take delight
In the loss or in the
You know, the
I'm not one of those people that wants to see game companies
Suffer because I know that means the game makers
Suffer and that's not
I don't see how that's going to make games better
Like sometimes I read Twitter and I'm like
The fuck are you people thinking? Like these are people's
Jobs and stuff
But at a higher level
I am kind of like, in a way
Glad they're going to finally walk away
From Final Fantasy XV in a way
Like I mean they have these other little things to cap it off
I'm kind of glad they're going to walk away from Final Fantasy XV
And they can focus on the next thing creatively
Which I hope
There's a Final Fantasy XVI in the works somewhere
That hopefully has been in the works
For a while and hopefully will be done
By the time they want to release it
But I'm a little worried because
Is it just me
Or is Final Fantasy VII
Final Fantasy XVI
That's the impression I get
Final Fantasy Remake is being treated like
It's a full Final Fantasy title
So Final Fantasy VII
Is Final Fantasy XVI if you get what I'm saying
I kind of feel like that's where it's going
But I just hope
Again creatively
I think Final Fantasy kind of just needs
A kick in the pants with a new single player story
I don't know if this did it
For a lot of people
You can go back to turn based combat
Dungeon Buster
Over in our chat
At live.vognetware.com giving me the numbers
I was trying to reach for earlier
33 million from changes
To Luminous Studios
Square Enix did not have a great quarter
But Japanese physicals tend to be pretty dry
Octopath and Shadow of the Tomb Raider
Apparently did okay
But we have no idea or numbers from Square Enix
On how well they actually did
But we do know from NPD
That Octopath anyway
Was kind of a sleeper hit here
It was the number one game of the month
For that to do
So we do know some little things
Here and there
Let's see, Siya Tabiri in chat says
Was it you guys who said that Final Fantasy VIII
And The Spirits Within should have been swapped
That Final Fantasy VIII was more cinematic
And Final Fantasy The Spirits Within would have been better fodder
For an actual game
Yes I have said that before
Both of those things were in development around the same time
And I think Final Fantasy VIII as a movie
Would have been amazing
And I think there's a lot of
Ideas in The Spirits Within
That could have been a great game
And then it would have felt more like Final Fantasy
I think maybe if it had been a game
Perhaps others won't agree with me
But that's my opinion
Let's see
Dungeon Buster continues with another thought here
I wasn't a huge fan
Of Final Fantasy XV's direction
But it had enough to keep me on top of the hunts
And grind through its dungeons
It's still really surprising how far Square Enix was cutting back
However with this news
Tigercall on chat talking about the Mass Effect thing
Is it a little too soon
To reboot Mass Effect?
I don't know if
Anybody wants to see them
Reboot the Shepard story
I think it's a good idea to do somebody else's
Story in the same universe
I think that's what they tried to do with
Andromeda
Andromeda was Ryder's story
And by setting it in this whole other galaxy
That was Square Enix's creative way
Of having your choices
From the original Mass Effect trilogy
Not have as great of an impact
And not need to have as much
To account for
In Mass Effect Andromeda
As a Mass Effect fan I would be okay
If they wanted to do somebody else's
Continuing story in the Mass Effect universe
And do something like Dragon Age did
When they did Dragon Age Inquisition
And do an online thing
That lets you revisit
Seven of the biggest decisions from the Mass Effect franchise
And tailor how
Your Mass Effect universe went
From there
I don't think it has to import my Mass Effect 3 save
And know every little nook and cranny
Of what I did
I would be okay if it was maybe
50 years later
And some of the big decisions have an impact
Certainly there's going to be some of the big questions
Like, did you cure the genophage?
That's going to have a lasting effect
Was there control
Or synthesis
And they may have to
For the sake of creative reasons
The canon ending is the destroy ending
This game takes place
50 years after the destroy ending
In Mass Effect
Although I know there will be fans out there that will be like
But my ending
I would be totally okay with that
If Bioware came out and said
This is a Mass Effect game that takes place
After the destroy ending
And what happens here
I would be totally fine with that
Alright
Looking in our chat with other comments over at
Let's see
And on that note, when was the last time we saw any new trailers
Or anything for that, the Final Fantasy 7 thing
At E3, Final Fantasy 7 was nowhere to be found
And they didn't do PlayStation Experience this year
So
They could
Do the game awards
Or something like that
Or they may just sit on it for a little longer
Which makes us all wonder
If that game is facing some development struggles
Who knows
Dungeon Buster says
But they can reboot the gameplay with new ideas
And hopefully new stories
And Bobby Blackwolf says
Then they can make another game that takes place after the
Non-destroy ending
They could
But I bet they would be more interested in making a trilogy
That takes place kind of in the same
General world, but we'll see
Why don't we just do it like Pokemon
Where they have, you know
Red, green, and blue or whatever
This is the destroy ending one
I think the reality is
It's different depending on your ending
That they would really be two separate games
Developed concurrently and I just think
Financially that's not the best idea
They really need to take the Fallout 4 approach
Where it doesn't matter what you do, it all ends up being the same anyways
Honestly
To get another Mass Effect game
I would be completely okay if BioWare says
These are the canon changes
That we're exploring
And due to limitations we're just not going to be able to
Allow you to import your own
Shepard experience
If they're going to come out with another Mass Effect game
It would be for like Playstation 5 at this point
I wouldn't expect that you're going to be able to import
A Playstation 3 save file
Onto your Playstation 5, it's fine
I can let that go
Just give me a good
Freaking Mass Effect game
Of course they can't even play Playstation 1 games
On the Playstation 4
So what makes you think they're going to be able to import any
Saves in the Playstation 5
Mega Man X400 is in chat
They're saying calling it right now
Final Fantasy 7 Remake will become Final Fantasy 16
It will be different enough that Square
Will say it's a new game
That would be, that would be risky
I could see them taking some changes
And liberties with the story and maybe trying to do something like that
But it would just, it would be weird
I don't think they would ever do that
I don't, I just see them releasing
It as Final Fantasy 7
And just dropping the word remake
Why not just do that?
I would think that is more plausible
Than Final Fantasy 16
I think they're developing something else
They've got to be
We saw a Square Enix
Crystal Tools trailer or something
I remember seeing something for the Playstation 4
That showed all this crazy stuff
That Square Enix was working on
I don't think it was intended to be
People thought, is there Final Fantasy 16 stuff in there?
Eh, probably not
But there might be pieces in that
That maybe they're going to work with
I would really like to see
Square Enix, here's what they could do
In my opinion
They're probably using Final Fantasy 15's
Engine for Final Fantasy 7
You don't say based on the trailers
Yeah right, which is fine
I would be completely fine if they
Use Final Fantasy 15's remake
Or Final Fantasy 15 remake
Final Fantasy 15's engine
To make Final Fantasy 16
But instead of it being like
The Broad Trip type of game
Give me something that makes me think
Final Fantasy 9
I'm not saying literally those characters
But you know how Final Fantasy 9
Was a throwback to the classic Final Fantasy
Like, Vivi looked like a Black Mage
I'd rather it be Final Fantasy 6
But I'm saying give me that
Classic Final Fantasy taste
In that
Final Fantasy 7 isn't even really that either
Give me that
Sure, Final Fantasy 6 inspired or whatever
Give me that classic Final Fantasy taste
In Final Fantasy 15's engine
I would be super into
Characters just with the medieval look
As opposed to the cyberpunk look
And I would be super into it
I would love that
So, we'll see
Let's see, Dartitsia says
Final Fantasy 15 remake
Coming to the Playstation 9 in 2040
And the Mega Man X400 follows up his comment
And our reaction by saying
Don't be mad when it happens
I won't be mad
But it would be weird
Hey, we just finished Final Fantasy 15
We've tweaked all this up
Let's make a Final Fantasy 15 remake
To be fair, to Delvin's credit
You know what else was weird?
Final Fantasy 11 being an MMO
That you had to pay a monthly fee for
So, you know what?
Weird or cool?
Well, the game turned out great, but I never understood
Why they just didn't call it
Final Fantasy Online
Like, would that have been a terrible thing to call the game?
Like, would less people have played it
I don't think that would
But then, what would Final Fantasy 14 be?
I guess it would be Final Fantasy Online
Well, 14 was weird too, because it's like
Yeah, we have all the same races
We're just gonna call them something different
Well, that's because 1.0 is garbage
And then, the realm we're born is fantastic
But they were pigeonholed in all the garbage decisions 1.0 made
So, they did the best they could, dammit
Dartitsia says
Like how Phantasy Star Online did it
Then Final Fantasy 14 could have been Final Fantasy Universe
Even if not as many people enjoyed Final Fantasy
Not as many people enjoyed Final Fantasy Star Universe
We're gonna get a goddamn Final Fantasy game that's gonna have
The Destiny model, where it's like this single multiplayer garbage
It's called Final Fantasy 15
Oh, is this what I've missed?
Not playing the game?
No, I'm not being fair
But, think about it
All of a sudden, now there's an online mode
I want you to keep grinding
It's just weird
I don't think I always understood all the approaches
Maybe you disagree with me
And you can send an email
That's fine, participate at orangeloungeradio.com
If you want to send us an email with your thoughts
Bobby Black Wolf says
Yes, but then Final Fantasy Universe would have been released in the US
Frowny face
That's Final Fantasy Online 2
By that thinking
Because we did get Phantasy Star Universe on Xbox 360
I loved it!
I was like, I don't understand
Debate for another show
Everybody hated that game
You know what game I really loved?
The single player
PSP game
That was Universe's engine
But they made a single player PSP game
It was Phantasy Star
I don't remember what they called it, but it was great
Because it was a completely different game than Universe
But it was just like that exact same engine
But single player, and it was great
Anyway
Well let's take a trip down memory lane
Of our gaming weeks and talk about the types of
Video games that we have been playing this week
Loki, how was your gaming week?
It was okay
I played a little bit of
PlayStation VR
Like on Friday I finally remembered
Oh yeah, that's right
Tetris Effect came out this week
So then I decided to sit down and play it
For a little bit, so I did
And I liked the new tracks that were in there
But yeah
I ran into the problem with it drifting to the left
Unfortunately because I was playing in PlayStation VR
So that was a little bit irritating
And then I decided to
Try some of the other games, because I've had a bunch of
VR games sitting on my hard drive
I just haven't bothered to actually
Play them yet, so one of the ones
I was actually looking forward to was
Just In Time Incorporated
Which is a VR game
It's a silly
Premise where you're
This government agency, or some sort of
Agency that
Gets to a location
Right before people are about to die
And you have to prevent them from dying
Usually by killing somebody
Else, and it's pretty funny
So the very first tutorial
Mission that they put you in
There's this person in an alley
A seedy alley next to a strip club
And there's this guy charging at
Him with a knife
And because you're wearing these special gloves
Everything moves ten times
Slower than it would in real life
So what you do, you grab the knife out of the
Hand of the guy that's about to stab him
And you stab the guy in the face
And that's the end of the mission
Okay, and it's awesome
It's hyper-violent, and it's
It's a silly
Fun game, so it's like if you
I don't know, crossing
Job simulator with
A hyper-violent game
Hyper-violent job simulator
Okay, I can dig it
I play a little bit of
I stream more DDR
And
I had a heart rate monitor
Working, but unfortunately
Fitbit decided to
Just MVP their whole
Windows 10 app
And so the Windows 10
App sucks ass
And doesn't work all the time
In fact, I only got to
Work once with the actual
With it being able to detect my Fitbit
So now, it won't detect it anymore
Like, I got it to sync just fine
With my computer, I got the heart rate monitor
To display, because we have recorded footage
Of that, and everything was perfectly fine
And sure enough, to turn on the next day
None of it wants to work again
And I blame the app
And Windows 10, because Windows 10 is buggy
As fuck, so you know
What are you gonna do?
So I guess I have to buy this
Unnecessary dongle that's
Got a plug in there to sync a Bluetooth
Thing to my computer, despite the fact that
I have Bluetooth built in
And it was synced to it at one point
I don't know, it's stupid
But that may be what I
Have to do to get it to work
Or just not put it in there
Because that may be the other option
Since it's just being difficult
We'll see
So there's that, and then
Of course I was working a little bit more
On my StepMania theme that I was gonna
Put on the cabinet
Once I load StepMania on there
So I was doing a little bit of that
And picking out songs I want to put on there
As well
Then, oh yeah
My new DVD drive
That's gonna be able to put that super disk
On there, that is coming
Very soon, hopefully
Actually, it last scanned in Washington
So it's just a few states away
Hopefully gonna get it next week
So we'll be able to do that
Preferably before
20th of November
It's the big day you're shooting for
Exactly
Are you gonna do an epic DDR stream on 20th of November?
Probably not, because it'll just be
After work, but we'll see what we can do
Alright, my gaming week
So I finally
Set up the PlayStation VR
Because I needed to play me
Some Tetris Effect, which just came out
Of course on PlayStation 4
I talked about the demo a little bit
Last week and how much I enjoyed that
So obviously I was gonna get the retail version of the game
We all knew that
I have said it on the show before
I'm a huge fan of Tetsuya Mizuguchi
I don't know if there's a game he's done that I didn't like
I even kind of thought
99 Nights was alright
But as far as things like Every Extend Extreme
Luminous
Meteos, Space Channel 5
I've always really loved
These games
So when I heard that he got the Tetris license
And that E3 trailer
Already sold, like I didn't even need a demo
I didn't need anything else, all I needed was that
Hey, Mizuguchi's doing a Tetris game
Sold, done, right?
It's basically Mizuguchi's doing a bullet
It doesn't matter, it's like okay, I'll buy it
He can do a bullet hell game and I'd buy it
I don't give a shit
He's great, I'm such a fan
So I'm saying that
Kind of as a disclaimer
Because maybe my opinion is a little biased
Because I've always been a fan of his
But I fucking love Tetris Effect
Outstanding
It's one of my favorite gaming experiences
In the last several years, honestly
It's
And I know there's people that are probably just going
It's just Tetris though
Alright, but this is like
Honestly the best version of Tetris they've done
And yes, I'm including the original NES
Yes, I'm including the Game Boy version
Yes, I'm including the DS version
That was pretty good too
That's not to say any of those versions were bad
Or more importantly, important
The original NES version
Of course, I mean Nintendo's version
Not the Atari version
Although it was important for its own reasons too
The Game Boy version was massively important
But Tetris Effect is like
The best one
And using the technology that's available today
And they have an homage to the
Game Boy Tetris song
In Tetris Effect
Oh, I haven't discovered that yet
That's pretty cool
I've discovered in some of the
Marathon modes
Or what are those
Not the Journey, Effect
It's in one of the Effect ones
The Effect stuff, some of it has the classic Tetris
Brick styles and stuff
Which is cool
So here's the thing, some of you are probably going to be skeptical
And you're like, Rob, it's $40 for Tetris
But here's the thing
Especially in VR
It's an experience
It's a trip
It is relaxing
It is engrossing
It is beautiful
I don't know how else to describe it
This is a great
Application to sell PlayStation VR with
Because you know what makes this great
You know what makes this great for PlayStation VR
Is that it's not
Like a jump around and flail
With the PlayStation Move game
Not that there's anything wrong with those types of games
But I think it says a lot
That the experience of playing on PlayStation VR
Where you're just simply sitting on the couch
With your headset on
And the controller
That playing this in PlayStation VR
Allows the world around you
To literally disappear
Especially if you're playing with headphones on
And really immersing the sound
As well as the visuals
It allows you to really just focus on
The game
And the experience of
The music and the art
That is being created as you're playing this game
Because even though
Yes you're removing distractions in the real world
You know there are
I'm using my quoting fingers
Distractions that the game provides
But it really feels like a journey
That you go on
When you complete lines
Like let's say you're playing a stage
Where the background is an ocean that you're flying across
And when you complete lines
Dolphins will come out of the ocean
Like in the rhythm to the music and do things
But then like maybe after you've cleared so many lines
Things kind of like go underwater
It's like you're just doing this trip
But Tetris is just that central theme
But like
The nice thing is everybody knows
How to play Tetris
I'm not saying everybody knows how to play Tetris well
But everybody understands I think
The basic concept of Tetris is not an incredibly
Difficult one to explain
So this is just a really
Easy game to get into
And even if you don't have PlayStation
VR I still think there's a lot
Here worth seeing especially if you like
Puzzlers I mean this is
Tetris
If it was done like Luminous
That is exactly what it is
There's really nothing else for me to explain about this game
Either you're gonna understand that
Description or you're not because you've played Luminous
You're either gonna understand it or you're not
But even if you don't understand it
I really like check out some YouTubes
Check out some people playing
It check out what it looks like and
Just see for yourself like what a
Trip it is but if you can if you have a friend
That has PlayStation VR or something
Really you owe it to yourself
To check this out in VR and really
Experience how the
Total immersion in a game
Like this can really change
The game playing experience
It's really something to behold
And then I guess one other thing
I'll say about it again the whole like it was
$40 for Tetris
You got like the main journey
Or story mode that has lots and lots of skins
That you unlock as you're playing the game
But then there's also like this side mode
This effect mode where you have
Sometimes weekend competitions
And you do this
You can do like mystery blocks
Or you gotta clear 40 lines
As fast as possible or you have
To clear particular poison blocks
On the field in a certain amount of time
Or you have to clear one
Line over and over like there's all these different types
Of like edit modes so it doesn't
Really feel stale and you know
All these different type of edit modes have their own skins
And you're trying to play to unlock them
So that you can just do your own mode with the skins
That you like if that's what you want to do
And you know that's another thing that's available to you
But I know the game
Is getting hazed a little bit because many people
Remember Tetris for multiplayer
Which is what the NES version
The DS version and the Game Boy
Version really all brought to the table right
Was the multiplayer actually did the NES version
Have that maybe not
Did the NES version no it did you can do side by side
It's been so long Loki
I knew the Game Boy one was infamous
For that with link cable and everything ok yeah
The original NES did no I don't think
I think Tengen Tetris had it
I don't think NES Tetris had it
Somebody in chat let me know about that
Did Tetris NES have multiplayer
I don't think it did
But anyway
I know the Game Boy did
But anyway
I don't think the game
Totally needs
Multiplayer I kind of feel
Like that's a door they left shut
Because if there is a Tetris
Effect 2 and I really hope there
Is a Tetris Effect 2 and this game
Deserves a Tetris Effect 2 I have a
Feeling that's a door they'll open and explore
But for this they wanted it to really be about the
Immersion the experience
And when you are sitting there with a VR
Headset on maybe looking at
Another player to yell at them about how they're stacking
Up lines on you is not something that really
Fits in with that picture you know you can't really
Immerse and do multiplayer
I think so
Maybe that's why they made the artistic
Decision they did
Dark Tetsuya said Tengen Tetris did
Two modes in fact
And Mega Man X400 says
NES Tetris had multi I thought it didn't
I thought the Tengen one did
And that's why people crave
That cart more but I didn't think
Oh well it doesn't
Ultimately at this point that game is how old
This is the new shit get on Tetris Effect
Leave the multiplayer
Behind for a little bit if you must play
Multiplayer Tetris get
The Tetris DS because it's
It's a great version of that
And has many other great stuff too but this is
Worth it on its own merits
As far as other games I've been
Playing this week I have been continuing Diablo 3
On the Switch I was streaming a little bit
Of that actually and I'm just about
To hit level 70 on my seasonal character
So I've been making away
On that otherwise
I've been still playing a little bit of
World of Warcraft I think my
Little warlock there is level
118 so I'm almost to level
120 where I can do the cool kid end game stuff
But for right now just still stuck on
Level 118 and trying to work on that
So that is about it for my gaming
Week so we'll get on into
The rest of the news for this week usually
I would do housekeeping but I've already told you
We're not going to be here next week so
But I look forward to
Talking to you guys all about Final Fantasy
Fan Fest you can always follow me on Twitter
Of course if you want some tweets because I'm sure
I'll be tweeting up a storm while I'm there
Maybe if the cell signal
Is decent maybe I'll do a twitch stream
From the convention floor because that's something people
Do now right so
Yeah maybe I'll try doing that if
Big if my cell phone signal
Cooperates I don't remember how good
It was or wasn't
At the Rio because they had it
At the Rio in 2014 but they did it at a
Different hotel in 2016 so I don't remember
What the cell signal was like there but I do
Remember in 2014 one of the gifts
They gave you in the goodie bag which I thought
Was brilliant a little cell phone charger
And it was already like full
And ready to go and I was like this is
This is brilliant sadly I don't think they've already
Released the contents of this year's goodie bag
I don't think they have that you get like a full
Like actual backpack this year which is kind of cool
Cool yeah but they also
Released an update about how we're all gonna
Have to go through metal detectors to get into the convention
Just because of the way the
World is in 2018 just compared to even
2016 yeah when that wasn't a factor
But
That is what it is alright anyhow
Let's get into some other gaming news Loki
Alright so this is
Sad but Prima Games is shutting
Down after 28 years
Prima of course you may remember
Does strategy guides for
Such games
Like we were talking about earlier Final
Fantasy 15 for example or
You know I think even Grand Theft Auto and that
Type of stuff so they're gonna be
Closing their doors
I wonder why
Now they're not closing
Until next spring but they're not
Gonna be publishing any new strategy guides for
The remainder of this year
Aren't they
The ones that are here locally I think they are local
They're the ones that are out in Roseville right
Because I know there's two big strategy guide
Companies and I think Prima is the one that's out in Roseville
Which is not far from here
Yeah I think so
I don't know
I don't remember if
That is them
I think it could be though
I think it is but I mean
Regardless it is still
Still a little I mean I would say it's surprising
And at the same time I hate to say it like with the internet
Having
Dismantled regular instruction manuals
But I mean strategy guides
Were always a heck of a collectible
They were and also
Like sometimes
I know I can use the internet for like certain things
Like I know with Grand Theft Auto 5
I bought the strategy guide twice
I bought it when they had
You know the Xbox 360
PlayStation 3 version and then I bought it again
When it came out for
Or was it 4 I'm thinking of
I must be thinking of 4
I don't know one of them I probably bought it for 5 as well
No I did definitely buy it for 5
So I bought it again when the
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC versions
Came out too because they had a whole new
Strategy guide and it was you know
I bought it to
100% everything
Which I still haven't done
Prima is located in Roseville
And I'm going to get very local for a minute
But it's for Loki's understanding
You know how there's Kaiser out in Roseville? Yeah I know where it is
Target's on one side, Prima's on the other
Well myself and Jamie we got invited to go there one time
That's right you guys went there once
And I didn't go
But we ended up not being able to meet with them
Like something our cancel lesson
I think Jamie did
I know she did but anyway that was a long time ago
I don't remember if that was
Like a secret meeting or what that was all about
Doesn't matter now
But it's still unfortunate
To hear what that's all going through over there
But I think again
It's just the whole internet industry
Just really
Kind of people go to Game Facts
YouTube
YouTube is a huge thing too
Absolutely now go into our chat over at
Live.vognetwork.com
It says nobody reads game guides anymore
It's all about the YouTube walkthroughs
Even Game Facts gets less used these days
Cuddlebucket in chat
I like that name
Says their money probably came from licensing I think
Can't imagine sales for physical guides have been great
Since the internet age
I always kind of saw
Again I saw it more as like collectibles
People just like to have that coffee table book
You know
I mean I use the hell out of
The Grand Theft Auto 5 one
Because it was
You have to make sure that you didn't miss anything
So that you can get 100%
And I know with games like Red Dead Redemption 2
There's ways you can miss missions
And stuff in the game
If you don't do everything
And Grand Theft Auto 5 was kind of like that too
With some of the characters you can pick up for the heist missions
If you didn't do the one thing at a certain time
You'll miss it
And that's where the guide comes in
And also finding collectibles
Because fuck that shit
Tell me where they are and I'll just go pick them up
Kaijuto in chat says
Oh strategy guide I thought it was the game mag
The game mags suck
I don't think Prima had a game magazine
Maybe they did at one point
But they were definitely more known for the guides
And that was
I remember when you'd go into Game Flop
And it would be like oh I'm going to pre-order this game
They do that now
Oh you want to get the strategy guide with it?
Yeah you get 20% off the strategy guide
Doesn't Game Flop use their own
In-house guide creator at this point?
No I don't think so
Because Red Dead you can buy it
Or they even have one for Super Mario Odyssey
And they're starting to get phone book thick
With a game like Red Dead I'm sure
Yeah
Alright
Cia Tabiri in chat says
The strategy guides almost felt like enhanced art books sometimes
And that's not a bad thing though
Right?
Some of them were
Final Fantasy VII strategy guide
And it was like its own unique art and stuff
I think Allen used to love to buy those guides
Like back in the day
Because we have a bunch of them on the bookshelf
They're for old ass players
They're more collectible items
They are
Moving on
Let's talk a little bit about some news out of Microsoft
Because Microsoft had their
X018 event this weekend
In Mexico City which was pretty cool
Because you know usually it's like
They do something in New York, Vegas
Los Angeles, maybe Europe
Maybe Japan
But you don't often hear of like a big game event in Mexico
So that was pretty cool that you know they got something there
So for the
X018 event we did get a little bit of news
I would say probably like not
Major major stuff on
The par of what you
Get out of a
Playstation experience event
Which reminder they're not doing one this year
Which is interesting
But we did get some minor updates
Including the fact that PUBG is going to be added to Game Pass
Microsoft continues to really try to push
The Game Pass which is
It's hard to argue with that
They're really trying to up the value of that
Another game that they're going to be putting on Game Pass
Crackdown 3
Which has it's official launch game
February 19th, 2019
I thought it was 15th
Might depend on the part of the world
The article I'm looking at says February 9th
That could be Europe
No it is 15th, I think there's a typo
In the show world thread, that's fine
So it's February 15th, my bad
Heaven forbid they make you wait
4 more days Loki, you've been waiting how long
No
No more waiting
Done, I'm done waiting
I gotta say though, I did watch the trailer for it
And Terry Crews is awesome
Of course, we knew that
Terry Crews
It's totally just like
An Old Spice commercial right there
He had one where it was him
Yelling at himself
Because it was his character and then him playing himself
Telling each other to be
Prepared for anything or something like that
It was ridiculous
And I loved every second of it
I saw the gameplay
Oh man
They have really
Toned down the visuals on that
It's not like
Remember, we need the cloud
The cloud's gotta process all this destruction
Because it's so crazy
This multiplayer mode has an arena
That you can destroy
It's not the city, it's an arena
It's not as
As a spectacle
As it was before
I'm still gonna buy it
I don't fucking care
It's disappointing
Let's see, also this is a pretty big deal
I think for some people
The Final Fantasy 13 trilogy
Is being added to
Backwards compatibility on Xbox One
That's pretty cool
Except for the fact that
The games I own are all on PlayStation
But that's fine, whatever, congrats
Well, you just have to wait for that PlayStation
Backwards compatibility
But that's really cool
For the Xbox folks
And I think they said something about
Civilization Revolutions
Getting like a 4K
That's pretty rad
If I had an Xbox One X, I'd be really excited
But I don't, but I still think that's really cool
They're supporting that
They did show another Kingdom Hearts 3 trailer
With the 100 Acre Wood
They talked about mouse and keyboard support
On Xbox One coming very soon
And they did confirm Fortnite will be a mouse and keyboard game
On Xbox One
So, cool
Even though I would kinda wonder
Why you're not using a PC
But I suppose not everybody has a PC
As beefy as perhaps an Xbox One X
Is capable of processing
So, still pretty neat I guess
And then they did detail some of the expansion
For Forza Horizon 4
Where you're gonna be looking for treasure
In lightning storms
So it looks like you'll be kinda using that weather stuff again
But this time it's gonna be lightning
But you can't take any damage from the lightning
So what does it matter?
Yeah, exactly, who cares
I mean, with all these stuff I've crashed into
If lightning hits the car, that's actually safe
They say you can be in a car
And if lightning hits the car, you'll be fine
It's like a big conductor, I guess
It's not gonna be very effective in all those backwards compatibility games
Stop it, stop it
So here's the thing
Then the biggest news
By far the biggest news
Out of X018
In my opinion
Two more studio acquisitions
So do you remember how the big news coming out of E3
Was that Microsoft acquired like what
Like five or six at E3
Guess what, now they've got two more
So they have acquired
Nxile Entertainment
And Obsidian
That's a pretty big deal, especially when it comes to RPGs
So they are definitely
Getting their chess pieces in a row
For whatever Xbox One
Successor is, Nxbox if you will
I don't think you're gonna see
Any huge announcements from these companies
Right away, but I definitely
Think Microsoft is positioning the chess pieces
So that when they announce Nxbox
I really think they're just gonna be like
And we're gonna have
This game, and this game
And this game, and this game
And this game, and they're gonna go
Like all through their studios
And I really think that's an E3 that's coming
Is when Microsoft is gonna be like
Not only are we putting out this system
But game from this in-house
Game from this in-house, game, game
Game, game, and they're gonna
Really try to
One up the hell out of Sony
And whatever they've got in store for Playstation 5
Hoping and praying that Sony
Isn't cooking up as many
Exclusives of their own
Because I mean track record though
Sony does release some big exclusives
I mean
If Microsoft can time it to get like
All six or seven of their studios
To like put out
One game every other month for an entire
Year, that's gonna be really fucking
Impressive
Do you think that's the direction Microsoft's headed in?
Cause I sure do
I think the system's lacking
Exclusives
And so that's gonna help
I mean that's really
The only piece of the puzzle I think
That they're missing, that and
Japan but you know
Akuma JP in chat says and again
Microsoft is buying their way out
Well, money talks
That's what companies do though
That's what they do, how else are they gonna get exclusives
If they really
Cause there's a part of me as well that still goes
Microsoft still feels like they're writing off Japan
If Microsoft really
Wanted to turn some heads
They'd fucking buy Capcom, Konami
Namco Bandai
Like one of the big
Well actually I would be totally okay with Microsoft
Like honestly, I'm gonna make the case right here
And y'all are gonna disagree, I don't give a fuck
I think the way to save Konami
At this point is for Microsoft to buy it
And I think that would be a wonderful thing
I would love to see Microsoft buy Konami
You can send those hate mail
To Rob Roberts, care of Orange Launch Radio
Participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com
But let's be real, y'all hate Konami's management
You all hate Konami's management
So why not
Get rid of them and replace them
With Microsoft's management
Which some of you are probably thinking
God, that would be even worse
Is it right now?
I don't know, Microsoft's management is in a much better place
Much, much better place
With the Xbox One than it was
When good old Don Mattrick was unveiling it
Sports, sports, sports, TV, TV, TV
So
I would kind of love
Now, I'm sure
It's a little more complicated
Because Konami has their arcade
Division, Konami has the
Casino stuff, which is all really big too
Speaking of which
Maybe there's a way that they only buy a case set
Speaking of which, was it
According to the 20th anniversary
DDR thing, supposed to be announcing
New game next week
Or in a couple weeks
In time to 20 November, probably
Yeah, probably time to 20 November
If Microsoft really wanted to do something big
They'd buy Nintendo
You can't buy Nintendo
No, you can't buy Nintendo
Nintendo has way too much cash on hand
Even after the Wii U
Kind of did not live up to expectations
It doesn't matter, Nintendo is swimming in money
After the Wii
I'm just
Like, yeah, I'm just
Being fan wank completely
It's not as easy as Microsoft
There's a strategic partnership with Nintendo
Where they take care of their online
And then Nintendo can make some games for them
She Hulk in chat
Says Microsoft should buy Nintendo
There it is, or Bill Gates should
And then we can play Gears of War on the Switch
I just, again
Although, in theory, you would think
Microsoft has endless, endless amounts of cash
So does Nintendo
So it makes them very difficult to buy
In that regard
But, again
I think a region like Konami's home computing division
Is not where it used to be
And I think is really ripe for the pickin'
Whoever releases the next Ridge Racer
Is gonna be the winner
It comes down to
We need a new Ridge Racer game
Uh
Go ahead
Sorry, this is a great comment from Dungeon Buster
Live.vognetware.com
They're building up their backlot
The way Netflix is gobbling indie filmmakers
That is an awesome comparison, in my opinion
Yeah, unfortunately they don't release several
New seasons of some shows
That I really like that are indie filmmakers
As well, but
What are you gonna do?
Hey, it could be worse
They could be buying EA or buying games
Or they could be like EA buying game companies
And then sucking them dry and then
Throwing them away
You know what though, Netflix is the company that brought us
Chris Pine's dick, so you know what?
All is forgiven
Okay
I did see that Chris Pine was in something
So I will now not watch that
Well, your wife's gonna make you
She's not gonna make me
She's gonna give a shit about Chris Pine's dick
No, I was gonna say
SSG100Matt says
Never thought we'd talk about that tonight
No, I was gonna say
One game that I'm surprised we haven't seen Nintendo
Put out yet
They have new games out in the arcade
Cruisin, the Cruisin series
Their latest one was a Cruisin
Blast or whatever it was
That's a Nintendo game
In the arcade
They should put that on console
Why not?
They should
Well, they should make some other racing games too
But you know
Okay, for everybody in chat that's like
I don't wanna see that movie
I'm sure there's lots of titties as well
I haven't watched the movie myself
And let's be real, I'm not gonna watch the movie
I barely have time to play video games anymore
This is what the internet's for
The internet will screen capture that shit
Are you saying the internet is for porn?
I'm saying the internet is for
Finding things without having to suffer
Through the rest of it
Dark Tetsuya in chat says
Yeah, that reminds me what Akuma said
Whatever happened to the supposed Ridge Racer sequel?
Well, there was the one that was on PC
Yeah
Alright, let's move home with some more stories
Going on to Loki
Alright
And apparently with the Fallout
PC beta going on
People have already developed
Mods for it
So they have a mod called Hairspray
Which allows you to customize the hair color
Of your vault dweller
Beyond what is available in the game
Of course, this being
An online game
The only person that's gonna see that is you
So it doesn't matter
No one's gonna actually see that
But apparently
You know, there's other
Mods available
Like for example, there's one that has
There's been actually several different Bethesda games
But a lock picking bar
So it shows you the sweet spot
For picking a lock
Which allows you to pick a lock pretty easy
Without wasting too many value pins
But I'm guessing
That maybe they're gonna be
Patching the mount once the game comes out
Then again, who knows
But
What's ridiculous though, speaking of patching
Fallout 76
Is gonna be getting a day one patch
That's actually larger than the game itself
So
The game
I think right now is
About
Like 45 gigs
And the day one patch is gonna be
54.64 gigabytes
Which is ridiculous
Goodbye bandwidth cap
Are we sure it's not like a patch that just bridges
The gap between what's on the disk
And maybe just a few gigabytes
Of the differences between
That sounds like insane to me
I don't know
But it's pretty bad
That they have a patch that big
And I don't know what they're gonna be doing
I mean aside, they said a large number of bug fixes
enhancements
Feature changes
And
I don't know
So we'll see
And apparently they're working on
You know, fighting off some
Hacking exploits
I don't think
That much of what they're gonna do
Is gonna have any effect on that
I think it's gonna be a big ol' mess
I'll wait and see because it's not a game
I'm planning on picking up
Alright, I don't really
Super get into the Fallout series
It's just one of those things
I don't like the fact that it's an online game
I'm kinda tired of that
I like Fallout being just like
Even like it was Skyrim
And that's kind of ironic because Skyrim
I would like that to be a multiplayer game
That'd be fun
But it'd be fun just as in co-op
Like I wanna play co-op with somebody
And play through Skyrim
That would be fun
Kill me and nuke my shit
No, that's not really
Entertaining for me
I don't know
Alright, well earlier in the show I brought up Mass Effect
And what could be in the future of the franchise
And this past week we had
N7 Day, I don't know if y'all know that
But N7, which is kind of the name of the
Special Forces unit in Mass Effect
Is usually celebrated November 7th
And historically
Bioware used to do some big reveals
And announcements on N7 Day
They've been down the past few years
Especially now that Andromeda's been out or what have you
But they did come out
And say that on Bioware's official
Twitter they basically said
They did this whole thing with the memories
What the series means to them and all that
And also they did kinda stealth announce
That an Xbox One X patch
For Mass Effect Andromeda
Did go live
So you get some 4K enhancements
But if I remember right, Playstation Pro
Kinda had those already
But this would bring it in parody
With Playstation Pro and probably some of the same stuff
That's in the PC version anyway
But still cool
It's nice for the people that are playing
On the Xbox One that they get that
I guess it's better resolution
And HDR lighting, so probably just some of the same stuff
From PC to be honest
But anyway, Casey Hudson
Who's now the general manager of Bioware
But of course he was a big part of the original trilogy
He basically
Did kinda come out and say
That
The tweet text
Or whatever says that
And Hudson talked about this saying that
There's future Bioware games in Mass Effect
In the Dragon Age series
So Mass Effect is not dead
There will be no
Killing of the franchise
The quote that he said
It means coming into the studio every day
Dreaming about what the next great Mass Effect game
Will be
So I guess they'll revisit it at some point in the future
But I'm still not pre-ordering Anthem
EA
The way you treated Mass Effect's Andromeda
I'm not gonna be jumping up support
Anthem, so good luck
Good luck y'all
Just to give you hope on how EA is treating things
Isn't there like N7 armor available
In Anthem or something? I heard about that
No, I'm sure that's gonna be a thing
But I was just gonna mention since it's not on our show roll
You know there's a game called Battlefield 5
That's coming out
I've heard of this game
But
Oh god, it's the whole thing where it's like 3 weeks early
Or something like that
But if you subscribe to their PC service
That allows you to do all these games
You get it like 10 days earlier
Oh, but if you order like the
Premium edition or whatever
Then you get a few days after that
And then if you
Get just the base game
Well you're gonna have to wait until the 20th
Or whatever it is
Well, I hope EA has a 100%
Quality product on their hands
Because when that does release early
The internet is gonna fucking tear it apart
Just like they did with Mass Effect Andromeda
And if the slightest thing is wrong with that game
It will be under a microscope
Just like it was with Mass Effect Andromeda
And basically what I'm saying is EA
You should've learned your fucking lesson already
Or Battlefront 2
I feel bad for the developers
I'm gonna leave it at that
I hope the game is 100%
100.00%
Quality
Because any flaw in that is going to be under a microscope
And then you're gonna get those fucking tweets
That are like, I cancelled my pre-order
Because you fucking flopped this in Battlefield
And
I guess EA kind of forgot
That like, the first week sales
Of a game is really important
And I'm sorry, all of these people
Are not gonna suddenly shell out twice as much
Money to play it three weeks early
It's ridiculous
It is though
Anyway
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
Rob was about to go on a Loki style rant
And Loki interrupts it to defuse it
I'm the only one who rants here, bitch
I don't think that's what you said
I didn't really have the full on rant
I said what I needed to say
We'll just leave it at that
Alright, let's move on
So Sony's got this
Playstation classic that's gonna be coming out
On December 3rd for $100
And of course they announced all their games with that
And now with different websites
Kind of showing little previews
On how it looks
We get to see what exactly we're getting
For $100
Well apparently the console is gonna be using
Standard USB controllers
So the, you know, non-dual
Shock Playstation controllers
So that's at least cool because maybe you can use that
On your PC and stuff
The other thing that's kind of interesting is that
It's running an open source Playstation emulator
Called PCSX Re-Armed
So
They're using basically just a PC emulator
On this console
To emulate these games
Which begs the question
Why do I even want to buy this then?
Because it's cute
It's not though
And they have like games from, it seems like from different
Regions as well, like they have the European
Version of
Let's see
It says, yeah they said a lot of the games that they
Booted up on the Playstation classic were in the European
Version, so like Final Fantasy 7
For example
Then also like
Grand Theft Auto
Yeah they're like
Click on a UK flag to display
The text in English
I wonder though if that's not necessarily so much
That's a European version of the game
Or if it's because DMA Designs at the time
Was a European company
So, you know, it would make sense that they would have a
European flag on there
I just don't know like
It wouldn't be the first time I've seen the English
Language represented by that flag
It's not like something to be
It's not a news worthy
Piece of news in my opinion
The thought is because the fact that it runs
This emulator is probably why there's such
A limited
Support for
There's a limited amount of games on here because
The games supported by the emulator
Aren't necessarily like the vast library
Also they're saying that
Some of the games like Ridge Racer Type 4
It has this like blurry
Dither defect on the text
Which probably looked good on a normal
TV which I remember it looking fantastic
On my old TV because I had a little 13
CRT but now
Looks really blurry
And hard to read which yes that's how it
Looks like on my computer so
Interesting I don't know
So you might want to
Cautiously wait for this
I think it's neat
But
Do I really need another thing I could put
NES games on?
I don't really
Bobby in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says
The C64 Mini runs Vice
This is a popular thing to just have these
Minis running emulators
They want you to buy it because it's all packaged nicely
It's for people who are not tech
Masters and don't already have the emulators themselves
He has a fair point
It's you know it's supposed to be that
Attractive thing on the shelf that Grandma
Is buying you for the Christmas tree
And I get that and that's why the SNES
Classic and the
NES Classic are fantastic because
Those games look great when it's upscaled
On a TV
I gotta say though this is kind of the
Awkward generation the Nintendo 64
And Playstation 1
It doesn't hold up as well
The Nintendo 64 might be a little bit
Better because
Mario 64 is a great game
But man
It's rough
It's rough to look at
Maybe like the Playstation 2 classic emulator
Whenever that comes out someday
Maybe I'll be on board with that
Only if it has Magic Pen Gel
Magic Pen Gel
Hell yes
And I don't know
Even the Japanese game lineup was way better too
I want an armored core
God dammit
Alright well I know one
Game that
Bobby Blackwolf says
Playstation 3 classic has Eye of Judgment
Then it can be a million seller
Oh that's
Wouldn't that be great if all these years later
The Playstation Eye
They finally sell a million copies of Eye of Judgment
And by the time you're 50 years old
You have to dress up like Tingle
Motherfuckers
Alright
I bet there's so many people that listen
Well there's not a lot of people that listen to OLR
But I bet there's enough now
They probably don't even know what that joke was
So we made this bet
When the Playstation Eye was first announced
So it was a long time ago
What were we calling it? The Brown Eye of Judgment or something like that?
No it's because they had this game
We saw it at E3
We went to E3 and we saw it through a demonstration
They're playing cards
They're playing a card game and I'm like
I don't fucking understand why I need to buy this
To play this stupid card game
Just play the card game
Why do I need to see the TV?
So Loki took a bet and the bet was
And he said if they sell a million copies of Eye of Judgment
He would dress up as Tingle
For the webcam that we had at the time
And come to the show
The closest we ever got was
One holiday, one Halloween
You came dressed up as Sackboy
From Little Big Planet, remember that?
Yeah, I do remember that
He had a really fancy little Sackboy card
That was about as close as we got
But we wanted you to be Tingle
Oh the other closest thing is that that Flappy
I always forget about Flappy Vog, it's been so long now
There was also
It was
He was one of our old listeners
He works at a game company
That had a Kickstarter
And one of the
Kickstarter things was like if you got
I don't remember if it was likes
Or random drawing
Or donations or something like that
Someone would draw you in a certain style
So I had the girl draw me
Oh yes, I remember that
And then there was
I remember there was an episode
It was the last episode we ever did on Live 365
Before we moved to All Games Radio
That was a long time ago, right?
That was before Vog, right?
So there was
We did a list list or something
What could Live 365 do to get us to stay
And I think one of the winning answers was
Purchase one million copies of the High of Judgement
By the way
Oh my god
I love this
This is so, this is recursive right now
So I'm actually looking at the Orange Lounge Radio
Wiki, because there is a wiki that
The fans have done
I don't think I've ever edited an article
I don't even think I know how
But there's actually a whole article
On the Orange Lounge Radio wiki
OrangeLoungeRadio.wiki.com
About the High of Judgement bet
On September 23, 2007
Wow, that's old
Loki exclaimed
That there would be no way that the High of Judgement
Would sell any considerable amount of units
Upon hearing this
Rob in the chat room suggested
That they should start a bet with Loki
Oh yeah, you want to take a bet on that?
The bet was that if the High of Judgement
Could sell a considerable amount of units
Loki would dress up as Tingle
Loki accepted the bet and set the rules
The High of Judgement must sell one million
Units in six months worldwide
This was later changed from
Six months to all time, because then you got cocky
Yeah
After the rules were set
Rob suggested another condition
While dressed up as Tingle
Loki would play an online match of
Eye of Judgement with Bobby Blackwolf
And set the Playstation Eye on fire
In the middle of the match
I don't even remember that, but that's awesome
Kudos me
And we would still totally do that
I know
I kind of feel like Loki would just
Do that for free without the Tingle outfit
Bobby, do you have a copy?
On March 2, 2008
At 9pm, Loki changed the bet
Once again
And combined the sales
Requirement total with the game
Let's Ride Friends Forever
For the bet
But then
On June 11, 2010
The bet was declared over
Why did we do that?
Because I think it was never gonna, I don't know
On November 11, 2018
The bet was reopened
Can we get on that please?
On November 11, 2018
The bet was reopened
Because now there might be a Playstation 3
Classic some day
By the way, they even, God
You guys are so fucking awesome
The final results
304,769
Plus
43,355 equals
348,124
Note, VG charts did not have
Any sales information on the European version
Of Eye of Judgment
Or sales information on any version
Of Let's Ride Friends Forever that wasn't the DS
Version
Y'all fucking brought your receipts
I'm so fucking proud, thank you Wiki people
I'm checking right now
If there's
An actual copy of Eye of Judgment
For sale on eBay that I can
Burn, oh hey, 1099
That's not bad
Cuddlebucket in chat says
This scenario needs to have Dark Sakura in the background
Looking disapprovingly
Are you kidding? She'll be handing him the match
I can get a
Complete set, including a Playstation
I can't because I don't know where the hell mine is
For 2699
Wow
Maybe we'll just do it
We'll be one more
We'll do a Twitch stream some day
Loki almost
Since it sold a third of the requirements
Loki performs a third of the bet
And there was the
Eye of Judgment Legends which was on PSP
I just don't think it ever sold
A significant amount of copies to count
Ugh
Alright
S2100Matt says it ended production
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was what
Caused us to say it was done
But I'm sorry, that's not fun
To end it, so it's reopen
You just have to convince Sony
To do it again
What's the physical
Game company that, you know, they'll make
Physical copies of digital games
You just have to convince them to do it
Oh, there you go, to make their own Eye of Judgment
Throwback
I love it, I love it
Anyhow
Let's move on
To one more story here
Before we get to the classic game of the week
And it has to do with another very modern VR
Game, and this game is a lot
Of fun as well
It's not one you can just sit there on the couch and play
But it's still fun, it's a game called Beat Saber
Excuse me, I had the hiccups
The game is called Beat Saber
And it's going to be coming out on the PlayStation 4
On November 20th
Which made a lot of music fans
Chuckle, because November 20th
Is a date usually associated with Dance Dance Revolution
Because there's a song
That, well actually it goes back to Beatmania
Over and over again in the Bomani franchise
Called 20 November, so
And there was even a 19 November
In one of the 2DX
Didn't they do a 21 November at some point?
I feel like that was a thing in 2DX
At one point, I don't know
I think you're thinking of September
Maybe, I see what you did
Alright anyway, so Beat Saber is going to be coming out
On November 20th, and of course
This is the game that you play in VR
Where you slash beats that are coming at you
Sometimes you have to duck
Or move around
The manifestations of walls
And things like that
And this game is also a little bit controversial
Because you're not just graded on
Special performance, but you are graded on style
How much flourish do you have with your moves
So it'll be very interesting
Also some features
There's supposed to be some extra PlayStation
Exclusive tracks
Like 5 PlayStation exclusive tracks
And there's going to be some brand new
Campaign mode that wasn't originally in the PC version
But the makers of Beat Saber
Have been working hard on the port
I do believe they plan to go back to update the PC version
To have the campaign mode
I don't think it'll have the tracks, but modders
Will take care of that certainly
I mean if they put the fucking B movie
In Beat Saber then they'll put these
5 missing songs in as well
You can all look for that on PC soon
But for PlayStation 4 people who don't have
Oculus or HTC Vive
You can check that out on your PlayStation VR on November 20th
I know I will be, because I
Really enjoyed Beat Saber when I played it on Bobby's
HTC Vive when I was at Dragon Con
Earlier this year
Are you going to be looking into
Getting the Beat Saber
Maybe, I don't know
You should, if nothing else check it out
Check it out over here
After I get it and see what you think
So there you go, by the way
The wiki has already been updated, somebody did put on there
On November 11th the bet was reopened
Thank you, appreciate that
It won't matter
You're getting cocky over there Loki
Getting cocky, alright
I guess it's time we go to the classic game of the week
What do you say? Sure
And so we take
A step into that portal that's marked
Radio Magic, and we end up
With the one and only Dark Sakura joining us
For the classic game of the week, hi Jamie
Oh hi
Hi, how are you doing?
I'm okay
It's kind of
Headachy with all the smoke outside
Oh yeah, I'm sure we will have
Addressed it in the show before this point
But the smoke here is like terrible
And obviously the disaster that's going on out there
Is really really terrible
The effect it's having on so so so
Much of the state is crazy
Yeah I saw
The pictures online just from downtown
And that haze of brown was really
Frightening, yeah it's like brown fog
But anyway on a somewhat
Lighter note, something that we do
When it's smokey outside is we stay inside
And we play lots of video games on a lazy
Day, but once a week Dark Sakura
Likes to find a game that she thinks, hey
You know what, you need to respect the classics
Put down your newfangled Playstation VRs
And pick up a classic
It's the classic game of the week
Dark Sakura, what did you pick for this week's
Classic game of the week
Metal Gear
Metal Gear
I can't do the David Hayter voice
Well and to be fair, David Hayter
Did not voice Metal Gear on the
NES, which most people
Are probably familiar with, although
Not really where Metal Gear got its start
Right?
Yeah, well actually it didn't even get its start on the NES
Right
Metal Gear first came out in 1987
For the MSX2 computer
In Japan and Europe
It is the
Actually considered to be the
Progenitor of the stealth genre
And it was the first video game
Designed by Hideo Kojima
Who went on to do all the later ones
Well most of the later ones
The Metal Gear 2
That we got on
NES was not the real
Metal Gear 2
He had nothing to do with it
The game, the original game
Was reworked for the Famicom
And then that was the one that got
Internationally released and it was developed
Without Kojima and had
Some drastically altered level
Designs and a bunch of changes
There's a more faithful port
Of the MSX2 version that came out
Metal Gear Solid 3
Subsistent to Playstation 2
And the HD edition that came out
The PS3, Xbox 360, and PlayStation V
They also had
A revised translation
I really want to play that version someday
I have never played that version
I loved Metal Gear NES as a kid
And of course as a kid you don't realize how butchered the game was
From its MSX version
So I really want to play this
Other remake someday
I can lend it to you
Sweet
The game itself
It revolves around a fallen snake
Foxhound
Who's on a solo infiltration mission
To go into the state of Outer Heaven
And destroy Metal Gear
Which is a bipedal walking tank
It can launch nuclear missiles
Anywhere
And so that's bad
So you play around with the snake
And you have different modes
And one of them is the alert mode
Where the enemies
See where you are
So basically a snake is seen and there's only
Exclamation point over the enemy
Then
Only the enemies on the present screen
Will attack and you can just avoid them
By going to the other screen
But if two exclamation marks appear
Then they trigger an alarm
That brings in reinforcements
Which you can escape from
By killing all of the enemies
Or going outdoors or entering an elevator
You start the mission unarmed
So you can get
You know, it's on-site procurement
All of the things that you need
While you're going through there
You also have limited ammo
You have to find ammo caches
Or stealing from other people
You can also get a suppressor
That can allow you to use a handgun
And some machine gun without making a noise
Some weapons are used
To clear obstacles
Like having hollow walls
And electrified floors
You can also punch people in the face
Which is awesome
So you can also defeat
A guard by punching him in the back
Which is, I guess, the back-end
Version of the strangle that we had
In the later games
And then you also get
Different mercenaries who will
Challenge you when they're at the boss characters
In each level
So you also got multiple floors
And multiple places around here
Really the PlayStation remake
Really did a good job
Of bringing in that
That vastness that you felt in the first game
You also get a transceiver
That you can use to talk to
Your commanding officer
Big boss
Or other members of the resistance
Such as Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer
Each of his allies
Gives them certain
Tips
They specialize in different subjects
Although you don't always get a reply
When you talk to them
The MSX2 version
They used a tape recorder
To save your game progress
Or a Game Master 2 cartridge
That you would save via floppy disk
Later on, they were all stored locally
Like on memory cards and describes
So
You have different
Your bosses include Shoot Gunner
Who is renamed Shot Maker
Who is a Spetsnaz agent
Machine Gun Kid
Fire Trooper
Coward Duck
Arnold
Bloody Brad
And a couple of androids
And another mercenary
From Outer Heaven
Who you don't find out until the end
So really
It was just a pretty amazing game
I mean, it was
Kazuma was actually asked to take over the project
And it was supposed to be an action game
With modern military combat
But the MSX was really limited
In what it could do
So inspired by The Great Escape
He reversed it
To focus
To avoiding capture
And so
That's where the stealth aspect came in
The packaging
Has Solid Snake holding a gun
And it was actually traced back
To a publicity still of Michael
Bean posing as Kyle Reese for Terminator
And
Kazuma didn't take the picture
But if you go back and look at it
Even I think got the same art here in the US
But yeah
You can like, is that Michael Bean?
Is that from Terminator?
Even I thought that as a kid, you know
So
As far as different releases, we did have the
MSX2 version, we had the Famicom version
Which was of course
Completely altered
There was the MS-DOS and Commodore 64 version
They were based off the NES ones
And the MSX2 one
The subsistence
Came out and it was the re-release
Of the MSX2 one
That had an updated
Version
Original and easy difficulty settings
Name changes for characters
A boss survival mode
That you get after clearing the game
A hidden bandana item
That gives you infinite ammo
Enemy bosses
That flash red and white when they sustain damage
Snake cigarettes, drain his life gauge
Which they did in a later game
Messages
Are now displayed when the player
Attempts to pick more rations and ammunition
After reaching maximum capacity
And a result screen is added to the game
That rates your performance
It is actually
Metal Gear was
Actually one of the 20th best selling
MSX games in Japan for 5 months
And it debuted at number 4
And peaked at number 3
They said the game was rapidly
Addicting
The NES version was also
Rates number 104
In the best made Nintendo
Games of their top 200
It led to
Sequels, there was Snake's Revenge
For NES which wasn't really
In the thing
Metal Gear Solid 2 Solid Snake
Was developed by Kojima and released
In Japan for MSX2
The same year because we really
Wanted more Metal Gear
And then of course
Solid was the next one to come after that
Which honestly
I mean it was a really really
Great game. For different media
There were books that came out
There was a Metal Gear book
That was done by Scholastic Books for World of Power
There was a game book adaptation
In Japan
In the second installment of the Konami Game Book
Series. It was set years after the
Events of the game were followed because it called back
Into Fox Town to do more
Metal Gear shenanigans
There were the remakes
There's an official and an unofficial
There is a mod for Alien Swarm
That was created
By Konami with
Permission as long as they didn't make
A profit but it was cancelled on June 3, 2014
And David Hader was supposed to
Voice call a snake in it
And there's another fan remake
That's in development using Unreal Engine 4
Called Outer Heaven
And there you go
That's out of gear
Yeah this game obviously left quite a bit of a
Legacy but yeah
Seriously one of my all time favorites on the NES
Which is weird because I never got
As into the later
Metal Gear Solid series. I certainly don't have
Anything against it. I just didn't really like
Have the money
To buy or play the earlier games
Then I just kind of fell behind on the series
It's one of those things I'm always like
I'll have to get back to that on a rainy day at some point
I just never have but the original
On the NES for me because again I knew no better
As a kid about MSX or any of that stuff
Is just a true classic
I didn't even know there was a Commodore 64 version
Until you just mentioned it. That's crazy
I have to play that someday
Well and the other thing too is that
You know there is Metal Gear Solid
From Bleed
Oh yeah yeah yeah the whole Dreamcast
Thing yeah
So if you want we can lend
You our Bleedcast version
That might be fun
And the disc if you want to play through it
It might make a fun livestream at some point
Well anyway there it is
Your classic game of the week Metal Gear for the NES
Dark Sakura
We're not going to be here next week of course
Due to my trip out to Las Vegas
So that means this is the last show before the
Thanksgiving holiday so I thought I'd
Close out tonight by asking you
What are you thankful for Dark Sakura?
Um
Respirators
Music
Music
Music
Good old Dark Sakura thank you for joining us
How you can during this
Time that she's got a work conflict
Going on here. Anyway I'm back here
With Loki and it was brought up in chat
While we were listening to Jamie's segment there
It was brought up in chat that
We had not discussed Pokemon Go
During our gaming weeks like a first
But you
Okay so I'm sure you did too
Pokemon Go community day happened
I went to a new place
Because of all the smoke outside we went to the mall
Instead of the capital where we used to go
We went to a big mall out in Roseville
And actually it worked out really well
Yeah I have spotty GPS in there usually
It did bounce around
And that made it very frustrating when we tried to do
Because there's a Sprint store in there and it's an
EX eligible gym
Alan still didn't have Giratina the legacy raid
So one popped on that gym during
Community day and I was bouncing all around
It was really frustrating but we finally got it
He got his Giratina and now
We're also potentially eligible for an
EX raid out there next time
Deoxys passes go out so we'll see
I mean if they do it during the week
There's no way I can go out there but Alan
Might be able to go and get his Deoxys
So we'll see
I didn't necessarily just want to talk about Pokemon Go
Because another game that you and I have spent
An awful lot of time playing, Ingress
Went through some big changes this week as well
We didn't even really address that at the top of the show
Especially because I don't think either one of us are huge fans
Of the changes but Loki why don't you
Tell us what's going on with Ingress and what you think
So
Basically they released
The app called Ingress Prime
Which is the new
Version of the Ingress
Client I guess
They redeveloped the whole thing in Unity
So they remade it from scratch
So it looks fancier now but everything is rearranged
And I don't know if it's necessarily easier to use
I find it's not easier to use
But that's because I'm used to the old app
Yeah the muscle memory takes a long
Time to change but people who are new to it
Will probably be like oh this is fancy
You know can do that. Recharging is
Certainly a hell of a lot easier I'll give them that
Yeah so there's some things that are
There's an advantage too but
So like I don't know
I've just been having some issues with it
Because like I
Decided to get the redacted app as well
Which the redacted app is the old app
It's just kind of like in
So they upgraded the old app
Automatically to the new version
But then Niantic also said because we know the new version
Some of you are going to have some problems getting used to it
It may be buggy and stuff like that
We're going to release this new thing called Scanner Redacted
Which is the 1.0 app
But you can only use Scanner Redacted
If you had an account already
And then on top of all that
On top of all that because people are like
New Scanner, I don't know about that
They also in their store
That they've always had a store where you could
Just like you know this fake money
And you usually buy portal frackers with it
Which allows you to get double the
Output of when you hack a portal
Or you can get like little beacons and stuff
It's just crap that you put above it
You can bling out your
Portal or whatever
Sorry I have to respond to this comment in chat
Over at alive.vognetware.com
Sounds like old guys bitching
Isn't that like any gaming podcast?
Yes we are old guys
What's the problem?
To be fair he didn't say it was a problem
He just said it sounds like old guys bitching
Yes we're old guys bitching
Continue your bitching
Here's the other thing though
It's kind of like they've been having some issues
With the new scanner
For example I
Just out of the whim
Just went ahead and checked out
Oh hey let's see what this looks like
So I pulled up the
Redacted scanner
And took a look at my area
I'm like hey there's some fields here
And I put the new scanner in
And I'm like wait a second I don't see some of these fields
What the hell
And so I took screenshots of that
And there's definitely a discrepancy between that
Oh and then they have like in their store
Like I said where you can buy the portal frackers
And stuff like that which that wasn't a big deal
Because it didn't really change the game too much
Oh now you can buy
Gear in the store
Now granted
I don't know if they've dropped down like
The levels but like the gear that you can buy now
Is level 6 gear
And not you know level 8
Or level 7 or whatever it was
People were very mad about that that's for sure
So I don't know
But it's still there
Whether it's a limited amount of time
Or whatever but I
I would just like the game to be as snappy
As the old one like I don't know about you
But like when I go to make a link it is so
Slow
Like it takes forever
I love like when you actually make the link
And I love how it shows what it will look like
Like there are improvements that I really like
But just like oh my god it's so slow
But you know the thing that they're teasing us
Because you know I just hit max level in Ingress over the summer
So you know what they're teasing us with now right
So they put in this
So the question was always going to be
Is Ingress going to put in levels above 16
And it looks like the answer is no
What they are going to do is
Recursion
Recursive Ingress
So now that you know hooray
I spent four and a half years
To hit max level in Ingress
And Ingress is now like bitch you thought
Now you can Recurse and go all the way back to level 1
And it's like prestige
Right
Basically they brought the prestige system into
Ingress
So I'm going to do it
But it's just
Like a lot of people on my team are doing it
And I was kind of sitting there going
I don't think this is a good idea
For the entire team to reset
To level 1 at the same time
So I'm going to wait a little bit
Until some of you get up in level
And in case any gigantic
Blue fields go up over town
Like somebody can
Respond to it
Because I didn't think it was perhaps the greatest idea
For the entire team to Recurse all at once
But that's exactly what happened which kind of cracked me up
I think they should all Recurse
Well eventually they probably will
So
Siya Tabiri says Ingress new game plus
That's kind of what it is
Kind of what a new game plus
So anyway
Yeah the Ingress Prime
Client is just bugging me right now
But like I'm excited what it will look like in 3 months
Once they've been able to bug fix it
Because clearly
God this thing has been in development for a while
And clearly whatever beta they had wasn't enough to bug fix it
So it'll be, it's weird too
They're taking all their bug feedback through
Reddit
So you can go to reddit.com
Slash r slash Ingress Prime feedback
And that's like the unofficial
But official Ingress Prime feedback forum
It's weird
Anyway, alright we'll stop bitching
About a mobile phone game and we'll get
Back into some rapid fire news
Loki, what do you want to talk about for rapid fire news tonight?
Alright well this is kind of a cool
Freebie with the whole announcement
Of the release date of Crackdown 3
Microsoft is giving away
Crackdown, free for this month
So go download it
Or go add it to your library even though I
Already have it
But you can do it
Anyways
So go do it
If you don't already, it's a fun game
Find those orbs
And then of course
With no
PlayStation event around the corner
We have to look forward to of course
The Game Awards 2018
That's the largest lineup of new game
Announcements in the show's history
Which they had a lot of announcements
Before so I'm curious to see what they're
Going to show off this year
It's going to take place 6th of
December
So we'll have to find out
What's going to be there, obviously
Kojima's going to be there in print
Well the fact that they don't have a PlayStation
Experience this year kind of means I think
Some of those announcements will roll over to this
So I think that's probably one reason why they're
Having a really good year for announcements is because
There's no PlayStation experience
And then
Microsoft didn't really like
Bring the house down with anything
Besides the studio acquisitions
They announced that X018
Was a big deal but they didn't really do
Any new game announcements so even
Out of Microsoft's camp they might have
Something in store for Game Rewards which could be interesting
And the Game Awards they said the
Cut off is going to be
Mid November
I'm like well yeah
Smash comes out like a couple of days before
Yeah no it sucks but Smash is not
Going to be eligible but Tetris Effect is
I'm just saying
We all know Red Red Redemption and God of War
Is going to win everything anyway but I hope
Tetris Effect gets like
Is there a category for pretty?
There's music
Yeah it seems like a shoo-in for music that's for sure
Alright well heading
Over to the Nintendo Switch
And it's online system
Of course the Nintendo Switch online
That's something they're updating monthly with
New games so November's
Games are on their way they will be out on
November 14th and that is when
Twinbee, Mighty Bomb Jack
And Metroid will be released that is what
Nintendo announced the specific day for that this week
Obviously I know I'm very excited about
Metroid. Mighty Bomb Jack
In my opinion was kind of garbage
Especially compared to the original Bomb Jack
Arcade game. Twinbee is
A very interesting pick because we got that
Here in the US is Stinger
But my understanding is we are getting
Twinbee so it's going to be like the Japanese
Version basically
No word yet if there might be a bonus
Thing because Nintendo did
No announcement or ramp up
For that Zelda
What the hell did they call it? The Zelda
You can buy everything now or whatever the hell
It was called. Zelda Easy Mode
Basically so it would be interesting
Maybe if Metroid gets something like that or maybe
One of the other games that already exist
They should totally I mean I know
It's so against you know their
I don't know
Mantra but they should totally
Put Game Genie support back in those games
Because that would be awesome
I know that Game Genie
Wasn't necessarily
Their thing but I mean
It would be nice
Twinbee was never released in the US I thought it was
Stinger
I thought they renamed it and put it out here
They probably changed it a bit too
In Light Force or something
Oh OrangeRite says Stinger was Twinbee
Too oh my bad I thought that's how
It worked okay thank you OrangeRite
Alright
Anyhow other news out of
Nintendo include a Super Smash
Brothers Ultimate demo
Starting actually this past weekend
Was a chance for you to go

That's probably the closest one on the list
To us and I'm not
Going to go out there to stand

Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee
Mario Kart 8 because you know
Super Mario Party Just Dance
2019 Overcooked 2 and
Labo
Even though that's been out for a little bit
I'm sure Nintendo would love to see that show up
Under lots of Christmas trees
And menorahs everywhere
Yeah it's true
Going in chat over at
Live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf
Talking about that mall says
That's where I used to play Drummania in the early 2000's
They had a Percussions Freaks 4th
Mix at the Vans Skatepark
I was the guy playing that
While everyone else was playing DDR
I had all the high scores there
And you turned that into actual
Drumming
I'm sure it had
Nothing to do with your actual drumming experience
Lending itself very well to
Drummania or Percussion Freaks as the case may be
Alright anyhow let's move
On to release dates and travel
Around the world and check out what is coming out
This week in stores and I imagine
There might be a little bit this week
Going up towards Black Friday

That is in a
Regular and a limited edition
Just so we're clear
What's in the limited edition?
Limited Things

It looks like it might be cute
But I doubt it will ever come out over here

Okay, busy week
But I mean, it is that time of year, right?
It's also actually a busy week in our mailbag
Very excited, you know, sometimes
Sometimes I'm sitting here going, no emails
Womp womp
It was because of the RuPaul Drag Race talk
They did it, it did the trick
I guilted, no we got a lot of emails tonight
I'm actually thrilled, so we have a lot of stuff to talk about
We have four emails, for us
For us, that is an avalanche, I'm excited
So let's get into it
You can always send us an email, participate at
Orangeloungeradio.com
First email tonight from Martin
Our friendly neighborhood, Belgian
And it's going to be talking about a subject
That we've already discussed a little bit tonight
But let's get Martin's take on it
So hello LR, your friendly Belgian Martin here
Just wanted to talk to you about
EA's Battlefield 5 release date shenanigans
The following is what release schedule looks like
EA Access basic subscribers
For $5 a month
Get to play 10 hour trial
From November 9
EA Access premier subscribers
For $15 a month get to play the full game November 9
Pre-orders of the deluxe edition
$80 get to play November 15
Regular people who just buy the game
$60 get to play November 20
So let me get this straight
I paid $60 for the basic version of the game
And I have to wait almost two weeks
After release to play
Even if you've pre-ordered the deluxe version of the game
For $80 you still have to wait a week
Sure they call it early access for origin subscribers
But let's face it
The game is finished, it's out
They're just delaying release
Unless you pay up more money
I find it very obnoxious
And I believe it harms the player base in the long run
Keep up the great show, take care
Martin from Belgium
Thank you so much for the email as always
This has been something they've been doing for a while
Granted this is a little worse
But before they had the whole EA
Access thing with
The consoles where they would allow you
To play the game a few days earlier
Before release
Martin here's my opinion straight up
This system killed
Mass Effect Andromeda
So why EA is still doing it
Is beyond me
And I say it killed Mass Effect Andromeda
Because when they put it out on early access
That's when suddenly it was like
Oh my god look at all these graphical bugs
When in reality the graphical bugs
Were like honestly it wasn't
It was probably better than most Bethesda games
But Bethesda doesn't do this
The problem is they take those
They take those micro clips
Those seconds
And it's look at what a garbage game
Mass Effect Andromeda is
And it ruined it
And it was because of this fuckery
So why EA is continuing to do it
Kind of blows my fucking mind
But I guess Battlefield
Is a very different type of game
And as I kind of referenced earlier in the show
If they have 100% confidence
That Twitter isn't going to be filled with all these
Hot takes on fuck ups in the game
Then I guess they can get away with it
But at the end of the day
Money talks
So if you pay for it
They're going to do it again
It's only really an option
The origin thing is only an option if you're on PC anyway
So if you don't have a PC that can run these games
Then you're kind of out of luck
Unless you do just the EA
I don't even know if they're still doing their Game Pass type thing
Does this open it up to piracy?
That's the other kind of thing
I'm surprised these games don't get ripped apart
I assume there must be some component of the cloud
The online service
That's totally possible
I wouldn't probably say that
I mean, I know
Hackers going to hack, right?
But I'm kind of surprised with the PC version
It doesn't open itself up to piracy
There must be enough of it that relies on the online piece
That you can't yank it off the EA access servers
I wouldn't say that
Because it's already on the torrent sites
So, uh, yeah
So, I would question EA's
I mean, I would never advocate for piracy
I'm not saying to pirate it
But I'm just surprised
That when that becomes a factor
That EA still kind of lets this happen
Maybe they haven't cracked it yet
But they've got it out there
But let's be real guys
This could be a place the industry is headed
It's not unique to EA
Microsoft just did it with Forza
Did they not?
It's happened before
If you don't like it, don't buy it
I implore you, no matter what the game is
No matter what it is
Now, let's go on to another email from Elliot B
Who we haven't heard from in a while
It's very good to hear from you, Elliot
Hey, OLR, I can't decide whether to get excited about Pokemon Go or not
I've bought almost every generation of Pokemon
I think he means Pokemon Let's Go
Because that's where the rest of this email goes
I've bought almost every generation of Pokemon
All the way back to Blue
And sunk over 100 hours into Sapphire
But every game since
I get bored of the same old mechanics halfway through
I'm hoping that the Pokemon Let's Go games
Add some fresh ideas
That don't just feel like throwaway novelties
What do you guys think?
Will you pick it up?
I'm especially interested to hear Rob's opinion
As a dedicated Pokemon Go player
Elliot B, thank you
And here's my opinion
I am really psyched about it
I'm jazzed about it, to play it
Because in my opinion
The grind for hunting in the grass
For a particular Pokemon
And doing the random encounter battles
Starts to feel really grindy
And that's where the Pokemon games start to lose me
I understand some people are really into that
And that's cool
But I do have that part of my brain that's like
No, you have to catch them all
Before you move on, even as much as
Shane and other Pokemon fans
That I know tell me, Rob, don't do that to yourself
You should just ruin the game for yourself
And I always inevitably ruin it for myself
So my point is, the fact that they've
Replaced that kind of grinding
With a
Ball tossing
Kind of like different style that they've taken
Out of Pokemon Go, the mobile game
Yeah, that does seem really appealing to me
Because they've taken out a lot of the grinding
Well, and this will be my first traditional
Pokemon game, because I only play Pokemon
Technically, I mean
If we want to get technical, it is not part of the
Mainline series, it is a side game
It's like a remake of the first
But you know if this sells well
We'll have Pokemon Let's Go
You know
Espeon and Umbreon
You know, stuff from the second generation
So that'll be
Inevitable
Let's go Magikarp
I'm sure a lot of people will be into that
SSJ100Matt in chat says
Meanwhile, Shane is buying both versions
Oh, I'm sure
He has a man now, so I'm pretty sure
He's buying one for him and one for his man
And they can trade with each other
Probably buying the two consoles too
At least one of them, I'm sure
I don't know, I'll text him in a little bit if y'all
Really want to know an update, but you can safely assume
He's buying more than one copy
I am only buying one copy
I got Let's Go Pikachu
Because when I was kind of doing an informal
Assessment on my Twitter feed, it seemed like everybody
Was going Eevee
I don't know what the difference is aside from your starting Pokemon
Is there really a big difference?
Well, if it's like Red and Blue, there will be
Pokemon that you can't catch
In one that you can in the other
Like, I don't remember what Pokemon
Didn't cross over
I want to say like Ekans
And, um
Arbok were exclusive to one
And then like
Paras might have been in the other
I don't remember, but there are certain Pokemon
That don't show up
If it's like Red and Blue, which is my assumption
But can I just take those from Pokemon Go
And just transfer them into the game or something like that?
Well, you trade them, you trade them with friends
That was the whole thing
You had a friend with Pokemon Blue
And then you could trade them into your game
Because either game had all the Pokemon in it
Just like now that they're up to like
Gen 7
And probably why these games take a while to work on
Is that with the Pokemon Bank
You can get Pokemon all the way back
From the earliest gens
And import them into
The newest Pokemon Sun and Moon
And I'm sure the Pokemon Bank
Will be supported by
The Switch Pokemon, which will be Gen 8
Which will be the next mainline Pokemon game
Assumably as next holiday
And this game is supposed to be like the holdover
This is the tied you over title
Which is fine
I think it's a very interesting direction
I'm really hoping it's
Yeah, I'm really hoping it's going to be good
Some folks in chat reminding me
Sia Tabiri says Bellsprout was exclusive to Blue
Sia Tabiri says
I think Meowth was exclusive to Blue
Some other comments in chat
S2100mat suggests
Let's go Bidoof
No one can play that, are you kidding?
I love Bidoof
I got more excited
On community day when those bunnyries
Showed up, the little bunnies
The bunnies
When did they show up?
At the mall, they were just randomly
Caught like three of them on just random pokestops
And I was more excited about that
Yeah, I finally evolved one of those
And I got a shiny
Whatever that thing was
I don't know, I didn't really need it
I didn't get my
My enlightened
Pokemon, though
I got the stupid
Ponyta that was shiny
But I didn't get a shiny Cubone
And I was very disappointed
Because I have a horse named Smurf
I didn't get either one, sadly
But you get the shirts
If you look in the story
You do the shirts, that's cool
Ponyta is shiny
I hate that that's a resistance thing
It evolved it too
It dulls out even
I like the color better when it's a Ponyta
It still looks cool though
I still like it
Thank you Elliot, great email
Appreciate hearing from you, hope you're well
Next email from Dark Tetsuya
We love hearing from Dark Tetsuya
And Dark Tetsuya is giving us a game review tonight
Hey OLR, so a funny thing happened this week
Destructoid was giving away copies of a new
Download title for Nintendo Switch
It's also on Steam
As luck would have it, I was one of the winners
So I got to try this game out
So this game is from Flying Tiger and G-Mode
Who you might remember them from the Data East
Arcade line by Johnny Turbo
Who as an aside was based on a real person
If you've ever read those weird comments they had
For the TurboGrafx-16 CD
That appeared in game magazines back in the day
And came out on Switch and PC a couple weeks ago
The game itself is an interesting concept
They've taken some of the old graphics and sound
Assets from the classic arcade games
And turned it into a team based
Competition twin stick shooter
Almost like Smash TV
You and a friend playing as BurgerTime star Peter
Pepper compete in a two on two
Game to take on the bag of money
And run it into your opponent's goal
But you'll have to traverse several screens
Inspired by some of the Data East Arcade
Classics like Heavy Barrel, Bad Dudes
And Karate Champ
Each with its own themed stage hazards
Like enemies and billiard balls
Although I have to say the single player challenges
Get insanely hard at times
This is definitely more of a party game
To get all your friends together and try to get to the goal
Before the other team does
So I'd really only recommend this one if you have friends over
Or take your system to parties or something
This is definitely more a multiplayer experience
Especially considering it's 20 bucks
On Switch
Well thank you for the game review
This was not a game on my radar
But you know I'm a sucker for retro games
And I love it when they take like retro stuff
And make new things out of it
Like NES Remix right?
I don't know what they're doing here
It's kind of like a hodgepodge of the Data East games
So that's cool
Yeah, fun
Alright, one more email for us tonight
From Frodo Swagons
Who says, Frodo Swagons here
I haven't owned a ton of gaming consoles
But when I think back at the ones
I have purchased or experienced
When I think of a specific console
I always have a few favorite games
That come straight to mind
Like my personal classics
I was wondering what are all of your favorite games
When you name off your consoles
Minar for Nintendo 64
Cruisin USA, GoldenEye, Pokemon Snap
Ken Griffey Baseball, Mario 64
PlayStation
Jet Moto, Kirby, Tomb Raider
Space Jam, Crash Bandicoot
PC, Roller Coaster Tycoon
Carmageddon, Doom
Xbox, 007 Nightfire
NASCAR 99, Unreal Championship
Test Drive, Fusion Frenzy
Outlaw Golf
The games that you, not necessarily
The best games on the system
Not necessarily the critical darlings
But what are the games that you
Are always going to associate with a particular system?
Loki, you want to dive into that
Like Frodo Swagons said, thanks for the email
I don't know, that's a lot
But with PC games, I wouldn't even think about it like that
I think about it as the different PCs I've owned
Because
It's going to be different
The PC is way too big
I'd say one of my first PCs
It would have to be Wolfenstein 3D
What the hell are they playing on there?
I remember this original X-Men game
That I really liked on my old, old PC
The Sierra games
I think that was later though, because we had CD-Raw
No, I had
The Secret of Monkey Island
And then of course
What was something else?
Click and Play
No, I didn't have Click and Play on that PC
Oh
Space Quest 4
Was another one they had on there
And then of course
More modern
The PC after that
The next one we got was probably
ZZT
Fuck yeah, ZZT
Yeah, so ZZT, Click and Play
Scorched Earth, Red Alert
Would have been something I played
A lot of on there
I'll take on some of the consoles
So like for the NES
The Guardian Legend, I'm always going to associate
The Legend of Zelda, the original
For sure
Mario Bros. 3, Mario Bros. 2
So I stayed up all night playing both those games
I remember renting Mario Bros. 2
On New Year's Eve
Because the place would be closed on New Year's Day
So you got an extra day for free
So I remember getting in there and getting that Mario Bros. 2 copy that day
And I actually have a lot of memories playing
Star Tropics as well
If I had played that game again today, I wouldn't remember my way through it
Because I tried on the NES Classic
And Metroid
Because with the Super Nintendo, obviously you know I'm going to say Super Metroid
But I'd also say
Honestly, like some deeper cuts
Equinox was always a favorite game of mine on that system
Draken, just because that was the game I got
As a launch title
When my parents bought me the Super Nintendo
They bought that game because the guy at Montgomery Ward
Recommended it to them
That is a true story
And then
I'd also say with Super Nintendo
I was on the tip of my tongue and I forgot
Final Fantasy 3
Which we all know is really 6
But it was 3 when it came out
PlayStation was during my college years
So I missed out on a lot of it
But for sure Final Fantasy 7
Because I played the shit out of that when it was released
Super Puzzle Fighter 2
I played a lot of that game
And other puzzlers too
Like Intelligent Cube
Played a bit of that
Those are some games I would always associate with PlayStation
And yeah, I think
I think I've said enough
Well, when it comes to the original PlayStation
I've got to, you know, talk about
DDR
Yeah, oh for sure
We had the mod chip, well, mod cart
I guess
Used to play all that stuff in there
Gosh, I don't know
The Jungle Book Dancing Game
Because that was the gateway drug into
The Jungle Book Dancing Game
Because that was the gateway drug into
DDR, getting a dance mat in the US
Remember? Who knows? I didn't say they were good
It's just games you associate
Alright, thank you for the email FrodoSwagons
It's always fun to take a walk down memory lane
Looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com
Sia Tabiri says for the NES
Mario 2, Mario 3, Dragon Spirit
Little Nemo, Dream Master
Dartitsia says for the PlayStation
Parappa the Rappa, that's a good one
Akuma JP says Einhander
on my PlayStation
So yeah, good answers you guys
Alright, and to follow up on the previous
email, the question was asked
How many copies of Pokemon Let's
Go did Shane get? So I texted
him, and he texted me back
Here you go
So far, one copy of both
Eevee and Pikachu, Pokeball
Plus bundles, so two
And the Pikachu System
bundle, so three, so far
Oh, and his boyfriend
technically is getting the Eevee
Pokeball Plus bundle from me
So four. We just pre-ordered
four of the Pokeball chargers too
So there you go
He needs to offload some copies of the game
I'll take one of them because I haven't
purchased one yet, and I mean, just saying
You don't need multiple copies of the same game
It's, it's, I
You know what, like, y'all wanna give me shit
for buying Mass Effect 3 multiple, or my fourth
copy of Diablo 3 on Switch, but
I'm just saying, I'll take a copy of his
Pikachu one, but, um
I'm just gonna go buy one, so I mean, might as well
It sounds like SSJ100Matt
won the bet in chat, I told you four
Dardisius says, yeah, you called it
And AkumaJP says, damn, hardcore
But, I mean, this is not, like
Shane loves Pokemon, he trades himself
That's what he does. Whatever, you like
something, I'm not gonna
You spend your money however the hell you want
I like DDR, I bought a goddamn machine
I have no room to talk
Hey man, you have no room to talk, that's fine
Alright, but there's the answer to the question
Alright, let's move on, we have some
more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to your calls
at OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word
on Skype, but first some news, Loki
So you may remember there's some games that
Japan's been getting that run on the
Switch that may not necessarily run on the Switch
over here, because, well, they're streaming
games, and so
Capcom was one of those that kind of
experimented with that, with Resident Evil 7
the Switch version, of course, you may remember
Ubisoft did the same thing with
the new Assassin's Creed game
but apparently they've had some actual
success with the
Switch version of Resident Evil 7
to the point where they're actually considering
on furthering
or to do some more of that
so, they're saying that, you know
after the success
of the
Resident Evil 7
there was
they did the fact that there was a
significant impact
you know, with the interest in that
that they're gonna probably try some other games
and while we did release this
certain title, Supporting Cloud Gaming
in the first half, this was done primarily
for technology, or technological research
purposes, and did not have a
significant impact on earnings
based on the results of the
research, we internally considered
future expansion to cloud gaming, so
apparently
that might be something we'll see a little bit more
in Switch, and maybe even something that we'll see
leave just Japan, and
not, you know
venture into other regions as well
so, I'm curious
to see
where this kind of goes
they're gonna get a return on their investment
that's worthwhile
I don't know, they don't really have any huge
upcoming games, I think, that would really
benefit from something like this, because right now
the stuff that they've released over here
recently, it's been like fighting games
and stuff like that, that probably wouldn't be something you'd want to stream
bonds006
in chat sums this up, saying
in other words, they made money
so they will keep trying to make more money
best wishes, Capcom
AkumaJP says they are still testing the water
I mean, honestly guys
this is also relevant
because I could see a lot more
games going down this path
if you are able to successfully
play games on the cloud and have the minimal
you know
delay, I mean you
would never be able to play a music game in the cloud
at least not with today's technology, but who knows 10 years from now
but I really feel like when we get to
the Playstation 5 and the next box
we're gonna see a lot more of like
shit that happens in the cloud, like you were talking about
it's supposed to happen with Crackdown 3
but for whatever reason they dialed that back it sounds like
but I really do think
that's gonna be a major part of the next round of
consoles and how we're gonna get
even more mind-blowing graphics that take
forever to develop I'm sure
so, anyhow
moving on, if you
and then there's Nintendo Switch
talk about
the technological pushing the envelope
but then again, you know what
this is how the Nintendo Switch hangs in there
and this whole story was just about
putting some of these more technologically demanding games on the Switch
but the Switch finally got
something that people were wondering, when is this gonna happen
so if you were waiting for YouTube
on the Nintendo Switch, guess what
it finally frickin' happened this week
they used all that YouTube money that they siphoned
from people putting
Nintendo games on YouTube
so anyway
YouTube is available around the world
it's on the UK store, North America store
I don't know about Japan, but I don't see why it wouldn't be
and of course
it's YouTube, and it's pretty much
the same interface and everything you're used to
on other platforms, but
now you can take it, essentially on the go
as long as there's internet
obviously it's still there, where you can't like download videos to watch later
that would be it
well, I mean, YouTube Red kinda lets you do that
right, but I don't think it does it on the Switch
I don't know, I haven't, I mean, who do I know that has
YouTube Red? All-Source has that. So many videos on my
32 gigabytes of internal storage
so
anyway, the YouTube app is
now out, by the way
and besides, you know, it's fine if you can't
necessarily download
videos to the Switch
because, what, you don't have a cell
phone or something?
Don't y'all have phones? Don't y'all have phones?
Anyway
that's what Nintendo's saying about voice chat
don't y'all have phones? But Nintendo
is also, on kind of a related note
looking to continue to add features to
Switch online
a recent investor Q&A, Shontaro Furukawa
said
we think Nintendo Switch online had a good launch
but the service has only just begun
so we have no plans to disclose any current subscriber
ratios or number of subscribers at this time
that's kinda interesting
well, that sounds like it's not very high
then
I don't necessarily know if I would read into that
it may be
well, yes it would be, because if it was high
it may be lower than expectations
but I don't think that necessarily means
it's a flop
well, I don't think it's a flop, but like
I can tell you right now, I'm not like
woooo, Nintendo games
anyway, continuing in the
statement, Shontaro Furukawa said
as for the kind of service this will
develop into in the future, Nintendo Switch
Online is essentially a digital service
but we are also offering controllers specifically
for use with Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo
Switch Online, exclusively to subscribers
of the service. We see the need to develop
the service beyond being merely
digital, in ways to play our
strengths as a company that operates
an integrated hardware and software
business, so I'm really surprised
that some of these new amiibo weren't
tied to this, but
so far they're not
it would be a hell of a way to get the ami-
do you know, so I found
out that
Dark Souls came out on Nintendo Switch
right? Now, Alan
loves Dark Souls, like he plays
a lot, he just got the fucking
achievement for getting all the other achievements in Dark Souls
that is not something you do overnight, right?
So, he plays a lot of Dark Souls
and I was like, do you want me to buy Dark Souls
for you on Switch? And kind of knowing he
probably would never play it, he was like, nah
I don't really want it on Switch cause he's not
gonna play it compared to keyboard and mouse, he's like
but, I'd really like to get that Solari
amiibo. I was like, okay
alright, sure, cute little collectible
couldn't find it anywhere
come to find out that whole thing was a GameStop
exclusive, I forgot that Solari amiibo is a GameStop
exclusive, he goes into a GameStop
to try to find it while we were at the mall anyway
hunting Pokemon this weekend and they tell him
the guy, the clerk who works there
said he had never even seen one in person
because I guess they sold out instantly
when the pre-orders went up in March
and he actually told Alan
the best way to get those right now would be
on the reseller market
and I'm like, fuck resellers
period. Oh my god, does Nintendo not
understand supply chain?
Oh yes, Nintendo doesn't understand supply
chain, quotey fingers, I mean
cause
I am so
sick of this, like
oh my god, we're just getting into
the physical, you know,
collectible market, we don't know what the fuck
we're doing, ahhh
I'm sorry, like, how
how often are we gonna use this
as an excuse, well we had no idea
what the demand would be
do you really have no analysts that fucking
do projections for you that you
didn't figure this shit out? I mean, I'm sorry
that's just really, terrible
excuse, like, this many years into it
where it's like this all the fucking
time
Anyway, if anyone out there has a lead
on how I could get one of these, not through
a reseller market cause I'm not paying markup
I would super deeply appreciate it
but I'm not gonna expect anything, but you can always hit me up
on Twitter at MrRobRoberts, but it would make my hubby
very happy if we could locate one
cause now it's a thing
Alright, let's move on, a few more stories
before we get to the Skypline, Loki
Alright, so
apparently there is this leak that's
come out where Valve is developing
a new VR
headset
so they've got images of like this prototype
Valve headset and there's a Valve
like, watermark on this
looks like circuit board here
they're saying that
apparently from the sources
that we're talking about, it's like
gonna have a 135 degree
view with a Vive Pro
resolution and
it's gonna be combined with, or possibly
combined with these Knuckles controllers
that they have and they're saying as well as
a Half-Life based VR game
that's gonna be a prequel
rather than a sequel
possibly
but there are like apparently
screenshots
here of this and they're saying that something looks like
they have a spot almost where a leap sensor
could fit
interesting though
no word on any sort of
details on when something like this would be released
but it is something that they're working on
so I guess I'll have to wait and see
you don't have
HTC Vive right? I don't, no
would you consider picking this up or HTC Vive
or any of that? If it was affordable
and
really that's it, if it's affordable cause
like right now that's what's stopping me from
purchasing yet another VR headset
I just don't play enough VR stuff
I do want one for PC because there's a lot
more out there on the PC
side but
I don't know
I'm still fine with just the
PlayStation VR for now
alright well
in other news related
to our little quip about don't you all have
phones which I feel like that line's gonna get said
once a week on this show for a very long time
but some interesting follow up
rumors, heavy heavy rumors about
what was to be at Blizzcon
of course that story showed up that said
that Diablo 4 was
a planned announcement and it was
yanked at the last minute
that was a rumor that Kotaku posted
but then they ended up updating it
to basically say the article
that originally stated that Blizzard recorded
a video and that co-founder
Alan Adam was going to talk about a new Diablo
game. Kotaku
is still sticking by that that video
was made but Blizzard is officially
disputing that it was ever planned for
Blizzcon in a statement
to Kotaku Blizzard said first off
we want to mention that we definitely hear our community
we generally don't comment on rumors or
speculation but we can say that we didn't pull
any announcements from Blizzcon this year or
have plans for other announcements we do
continue to have different teams working on
multiple unannounced Diablo projects
and we look forward to announcing when the time
is right but Kotaku is doubling
down basically saying two people
familiar with Blizzard's plans confirmed
that the company recorded a video
where co-founder Alan Adam said
spoke to fans about a new Diablo
project so basically
what's being disputed is what
is it for?
Perhaps it's an
announcement for the game awards which
would seem ridiculous to me to not
play that at Blizzcon
like if it turns out
that they're going to announce it at the game awards
and they passed Blizzcon to do that
that's whoo oh
the Blizzard fans are not
going to be happy. Well on top of that too
I did see something
that was a press event or something
like shortly after all the announcements
and they were talking about
that their development teams
that are working on Diablo
that a lot of them
or even some of their top developers
from all the different
franchises that they have are working on
mobile projects so that
pissed people off as well because they're like
well wait a second you're taking your top people
from all these other things to
develop mobile games
what the fuck you guys
so that's just
kind of a little bit more salt
in the wounds I guess
Well
what do you think? Do you think
it's possible that they were going
to announce it and then they pulled it?
I'm like why would you pull that?
I guess there's concern about
oh it's the game's been
going in these different directions and
it's kind of you know it's hitting that
phase a lot of games do where they're not totally
sure like what the final product is going to look like but I'm like
you could still just announce
you're doing it like it's everything I said in
last week's show if they had just followed up
that announcement just like
Bethesda did with a 30 second trailer
that shows the Diablo 4 logo
it doesn't even have to be the final logo
just one that they could then
sell on t-shirts and people would buy it. It's too late
though. It's too late now
but I mean I just
I feel like video game PR people
are going to study this fuck up for years
They'll remember it
for sure
Anyway moving on
a couple more stories before the
Skype line just two more Loki
Alright and so apparently
there's
with you guys may remember
Smash Brothers so with
Mr. Game and Watch
they had some different attacks that were
in there one of which unfortunately
is mildly racist apparently
so it's the attack where
he kind of
looks like a Native American
or whatever and he
throws fire so apparently
this fire attack which is
from well the game fire attack
might be a little bit offensive
nowadays so they're going to be
retooling that and changing
it because it doesn't necessarily
represent the company's values
nowadays
so they're going to have to I guess
redesign how that's going to look
and it will be in effect
I guess in the new Smash
Brothers game so they say
yeah Nintendo's been planning to distribute an
update for Smash Brothers Ultimate
that removes the feature or the
feather from the silhouette of Mr. Game
and Watch
the original game on
which is this depiction of the character's base
was released more than three decades ago and doesn't
represent our company's values today
we apologize if you were offended
alright
well I suppose that's nice
of a company to listen to the feedback and
correct their course yeah
that's just a minor thing alright
before we go to the phones
I do want to point out another heavy
rumor but I think this is more
than rumor because it was discovered in a Steam
database that
Sunset Overdrive is on its way
to the PC this
after an ESRB listing was already
released now I bet this is the type of thing
that could show up at Game Awards because if
they didn't announce it at X018
which would have been the perfect place to do it
well I guess not, not for PC
I would think that Game Awards is like a shoe-in
they're going to come out in Game Awards and say this is Sunset
Overdrive is available today
on PC I would bet that's going to be
what happens we'll see but anyway
a lot of people that did play this game really
enjoy it, it kind of went under the radar
for a lot of people I think just because the Xbox One
didn't end up as highly adopted
I'm surprised it's becoming the Steam and not like
the Windows Store I guess
Microsoft probably just wants to put it everywhere
but then again wasn't
their other game that was
I can't remember what the hell that game was called
but like the other
Xbox One game that
was a Kinect game but not a Kinect game
anymore I can't remember
what the fuck it was called but
Kinect developed it but
I don't know I think that
well but then Forza is not available on Steam
well then the other one too also
Dead Rising, didn't Dead Rising
end up coming out? I believe it did you're right
yeah so
but yeah so anyway looks like Sunset Overdrive
is going to be happening it's just a matter
of when and honestly
Microsoft is releasing most things on
PC and Xbox anyway
Crackdown 3 has got to be a PC game as well right?
yeah it's going to be on the Windows Store
honestly I might just pick it up on PC well I guess
I might as well get the one that's universal right? You buy it
digitally you get the universal thing right? I imagine that's still
going to be the case just like it was for Forza
yeah I think so I'll probably pick that up that's pretty cool
so cool Sunset Overdrive
probably on its way to PC
I wonder how that's going to work though if I already own it on
Xbox One thanks to games with gold
I would already own it digitally so are they going to
give me the PC one for free? They might if they
make it a play anywhere type thing
that would actually be I would be like so happy
I mean I guess Steam wouldn't really be involved
in that case but still hey free game
so alright
let's go to the phones you can
give us a call right now at Orange Lounge Radio
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype is the
place to send us a call
I also want to make sure I get a plug in for
our Discord server at some point
tonight so if you're not on our Discord
server I'd really urge you to get on there
you can keep up with Orange Lounge Radio throughout the week
submit potential stories which some
of these stories tonight came from you guys
over on Discord just go to
and that will get you everything you need
you do not need an invite it's an open
invite we just ask you you know
don't be a dickhead on
Discord and so far that's worked out pretty
good all the people that have joined the Discord so far
have been pretty reasonable and
not been assholes
so it's a fun environment over
there Orange Lounge Radio all one word
on Skype I just missed I saw a call pop up and
I just missed it so hopefully
that person calls back in the meantime though
I can check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute
stories quickly oh yes of course we have hold
that thought that call just popped
right back up hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
hey hey what's going on everyone
hey Rama good to hear from you what's up buddy
not much it's good to hear from you
too it is great to hear from
you I'm here every week you're here
almost every week well
I try I try so
you know coming out of the end of the con
season and so forth you know well we appreciate
it so what's on your mind tonight buddy
Sunset Orange Drive is
is one again that's one of those games
how did I miss it
I picked it up for 10 bucks and
I'm having a fucking blast with
that game I think there's a lot of people that really
slept on the game and to be honest I haven't played
it a lot and it's one of those titles I really need
to go back and play more but especially
if it does end up being play anywhere on
PC I think I probably yeah
I'd like super check it out why not
I mean they gave that game away
so I think a lot of people have it
yeah definitely and
another thing I
quit like the tail end of
XO 18 like the summary
and I have to say
Microsoft kind of got me shook
why is that what what what
shook you at XO 18
the studio purchases or what
no Final Fantasy backwards
compatibility
that I mean I'm excited for
people that owned it on Xbox but I
had them on PlayStation so unfortunately
it does me no good and I just
I don't see myself buying those
games on Xbox one when
I already did buy Final Fantasy 13
on PC and
you might remember it was a little bit bumpy when it first
came out on PC it had like some
graphic things holding it back but they they tweaked
it and they release you know they they like updated
it via patch and it's it's pretty
solid like the PC release is pretty good
so I feel like if
they up rezzed or
did anything special to Final Fantasy
they probably just kind of ported the PC version
to Xbox one which is not a bad
thing it's it's great it looked great on
PC I don't know I think they went
back and worked on the 360 version
and made it a little bit better I mean
yes I have all three
games for PlayStation 3 but
I think about
almost a year ago I had my
system reflowed
and now when I turn on my PS3
it sounds like a jet engine
and I'm looking at the prices of
FF 13 on
360 and it's like I could pick up all
three games for 25 bucks
which is like probably cheaper
than what it's going to be you know
in the in the Microsoft store you know
for Xbox one that's
that's not bad yeah I
I do think there was a missed opportunity here to
like repackage and release a trilogy
but that's
you see you got that on the second hand market
for 25 bucks yeah on
Amazon that's
really not a bad idea that may that
may be a way to do it like to pick up the games
on the second hand market and then play them that way
is actually like a really smart idea kudos
on that that's what I've been doing a lot
of the games and I notice you know
yes GameStop may have
it for 19 bucks used
but I can just go right over to Amazon
pick it up for the same price brand spanking new
in the case everything so
yeah and now that you got
the other Final Fantasy games coming
over I'm just kind of hyped about
it and you know I get
it that the Final Fantasy
games are supposed to be like defunct
to Playstation I get that
right but it's like I said
the only reason why I
picked up a 360
I mean Xbox one is for the
backwards compatibility and
half of my 360 games play
on the one hell when I thought
about Crackdown I popped that in last night
and I'm up for like two hours playing through that
game I'm just like this looks
amazing well and now
even if you didn't have Crackdown we just
mentioned earlier they're giving it away
so you can get Crackdown so
there's no reason not to check
it out which of course is all just promo
for Crackdown
3 which is very similar
to and again a reminder this is kind
of your last chance cause it's only gonna be up for
another week but Destiny 2
is free on PC
if you have the battle net launcher which if
you've ever played Hearthstone or
some of the free games that
Blizzard has then you have the
battle net launcher you can get free Destiny 2
but we all know it's because
they have an expansion they're trying to sell so
that's the thing you're gonna have to buy
but hey it's still a free game
I mean yeah I dumped on that too so
yeah
so well free stuff is good
and backwards compatibility
is great and I really
wish it was a message that Sony would hear
but for whatever reason they're not
I mean
look we had backwards compatibility
for the Playstation 2 to the 1
we had a PS3 for 1
and 2 until they ripped
that out and put it in the slip
now they can't
say it cannot be done
because the
Xbox One and
the Playstation 4 are the
same identical
hardware
the speeds of the processors are slightly different
the software that runs it is different
but it can't be done
I mean if Microsoft can do it
it's no excuse
Sony can't, Microsoft's like oh we got this
it's backwards compatible we have it in the store
for $19.99 wait you have
the game pop it in yours now
for free we already know if
nothing else that machine is perfectly capable
of doing PS1 and PS2 games
if nothing else we know
the Playstation 4 can do that so
it's just weird to me that they don't
open it up so and I see in chat
Kaijuto says I don't ever want Sony
to go back well I'm not like
I honestly feel at this
point it's like a switch it's a button
that Sony won't push
you know and if you don't want to play retro
stuff fine don't again it's your money
spend it on what you want but for those of us
that would love to play Magic Penjel again
on Playstation 4
let us do it
I mean I understand there are
some people out there that are console
collectors they have the space for it
if you saw my entertainment center
I'm running out of space
I'm picking up the PS4 on Black Friday
and I'm looking
well there I'm going to take the PS2 out
and put the PS4 there
like you said I'd be happy with the PS1
emulation on the PS4
I can retire my PS3 fat
that sounds like a NASA jet rocket
and put a slim in there and call
it a day
well we'll see if
this gamble pays off for Sony
by the time the Playstation 5 rolls around
because I bet you I just
it's so interesting because
I just remember when it was
Playstation 3 versus Xbox 360
and Microsoft clobbered
Sony out the gate anyway
and Sony spent a long time catching up
and the tables got reversed
this last time and Sony clobbered
Microsoft out the gate
you know Microsoft is catching up to an extent
but Sony's got the lead
I'm almost wondering if
it's going to flip again
and coming out with the next series
because Microsoft's got all these studios
and will likely open itself up
to backwards compatibility and pretty much has already
said that no matter what they do
with the Xbox in the future it's still going to play
the older games or whatever
so it would be interesting to see if Sony's going to
follow suit or if they're going to stay stubborn like this
and if that decision comes back
to bite them
you know you said it back
a few episodes back
as long as Sony's on top
they're not going to care
when Microsoft was on top they're not going to care
and then the role was reversed
so why hasn't either company learned yet
that maybe you should care when you're on top
because you're not going to be on top forever
well I think Microsoft is starting to learn
like when they had their
Windows phones
their Windows phones are great
on a business level
but not on a personal
the hardware is there
the apps are not
the fact that Square Enix
says the Final Fantasy games are coming to Xbox One
that means
Microsoft is starting to realize
you need to not just
throw money to buy studios
you need to throw money at the third party to be like
here's X amount of money
we want these titles on our system
I mean that's basically what Sony is doing
I mean look at the gaming
tournaments for fighting games
mostly everyone's playing on PS4
for the fighting games
next year is going to be a hell of a year
because I anticipate
Microsoft is going to be first out the gate
next year so it's going to be very
interesting to see what happens
alright my friend I'm going to let you go
to try and squeeze in some more calls but thank you as always
for the call
take care buddy
OrangeLawnTradio all went over it on Skype
and I had cut off a last minute story you wanted
to do Loki while we wait for calls
there's this game called Scum which apparently
had a patch issued
for it that fixed
a bunch of bugs in the games
all related to penis size
because I like this game like Conan
or Age of Conan I believe
you create your character and the penis
size and there's an issue where
the penis size would get bigger
each time you logged in
and there's also one that says
it's possible to increase penis size without it
affecting other attributes and
urinating would lock hands if the penis
and penis if
interrupted
penises are very complicated
things apparently
in video games
alrighty
then
DarkTit Studio in chat says
this isn't a SoulCalibur 6 situation is it
also wow speaking of SoulCalibur 6
oh no I think we did touch on it last week
the Nier character coming to SoulCalibur 6 I guess that wasn't
rapid fire last week I think
I think we mentioned it yeah
I need to still pick up SoulCalibur 6
I still have not picked that up
and I really want to play it but
it's that time of year where everything's coming out
now we got Let's Go and
all this other stuff
one more call for calls Orange Lounge Radio all one word
on Skype
and by the way I just want you guys to know
that I'm extremely
happy because it sounds like somebody's coming through
on the Amiibo that I need
so I'm like super jazzed about that
you don't even know so
you guys are awesome this is what motivates me to keep
coming back every week to do this show
for serious how awesome you guys are
um
did you do
no other stories no
I did see someone talking about
since you know obviously we have
a very good version of Tetris
on the Playstation 4
that there was a not so
good version of Tetris Ubisoft
made about a year ago
on the Playstation 4 I think
I think I actually own that one too
I think you do own it
I don't remember what the
I feel like it had frame rate issues or something
like really basic that shouldn't have been there so
uh it's always interesting to see
like who gets the Tetris license and what they do with it
because I feel like the Tetris company really
licenses that out to like multiple people
at once like pretty much whoever wants
to do it so but I'm
they might as well just delist
the whatever Ubisoft made last year well
I shouldn't be such an ass
because it had the
multiplayer stuff a little more embedded in it
and Tetris Effect doesn't have multiplayer
but you know it does have multiplayer
Puyo Puyo vs Tetris has a decent
multiplayer in it and it has Puyo Puyo
so you know
I still think they'll inevitably
do a Tetris Effect 2 I mean I really
hope they do I
just as long as
Tetsuya Mizuguchi gets to keep making games
I think they just do DLC
maybe
I mean I would love to see them just do more skins
and songs maybe some commercial
stuff as DLC
yeah well remember
when Luminous on 360 I know I brought this up before
remember when we went to that E3 and they were
showing Luminous on 360 with like
MTV type songs as skins
and I've I this never
came out but I played Madonna's
Sorry that song in that music
video was a Luminous skin that they never
released for whatever reason I don't know if the licensing
fell through or what but that was something I played
at E3 and I was super excited about it I remember
not being able to really hear it on the show floor
but it had the video of Madonna dancing
and the only stuff
we ever really got was all like the in-house
like Genki Rockets and all that stuff
they never did like
actual songs
probably thought they couldn't get the return on investment
maybe I don't know but Luminous 2
on PSP which people
don't talk about as much as the original
Luminous 2 had a lot of commercial
stuff in it it had like Hollaback Girl
it had a Missy Elliott song it had Beck
it had like a lot of commercial stuff in it
I still don't remember that now
I don't know why people didn't like that version
of the game as much I thought it was great
but anyway
alright well sadly that's
looks like the well is pretty dry on phone
calls but that's okay you guys did great on
emails tonight if you do think of anything
you would like to email us about
you can send us an email participate at
orangeloungeradio.com if you don't send us
emails I mean look out because they just announced
RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars 4
so I'll have plenty to talk about
alright
anyway that's about going to do it
for another episode of Orange Laundrio
I want to thank you guys for listening to our show
and being here every week to support us really appreciate
it and if you like what you heard here at Orange Laundrio
please tell a friend or two about the show
and help us spread the word because we are the show where every
gamer has a voice but only if the
voices are here to air them
so please a nice 5 star
review on a place like iTunes or
Google Play podcast or wherever it is you
heard about this those go
a long way as well I am aware
that you can get more podcasts on Spotify
that is a direction I will go with
OLR soon but behind the scenes
we're going to be moving our hosting around
the same time that we move to Twitch
so for that reason I've held off on Spotify
submission but I know that's something on people's radar
and I will get us there
soon so but
otherwise we're in a lot of podcasting places
as it is
I think that's all I have to say
so I think we can go around and get final thoughts
Loki your final thought tonight
my final thought is I have
a hell of a migraine and I'm not sure if it's
because I spent the whole day with the kids or because
of the smoke or a little bit of both
a little bit of column A a little bit of column B
for sure for sure and I guess on
that note my final thought is
I just I
hope people are okay after the
fires I hope they're able to build stuff back
it's just it's so horrible
reading about all that and knowing that I've been to a
town that doesn't exist anymore it's really weird
but my thoughts are with everybody
affected by that and for those near
the smoke stay indoors play
some video games that's probably the
best thing to do right now have a great night
everybody we'll see you next time in two weeks
on the next episode of Orange Lounge
Radio where every gamer has a voice I will see
you in Las Vegas next week
if you're going to be at Final Fantasy Fan Fest by chance
hit me up on Twitter at MrRobRoberts and
come say hello we'll see you back here in two weeks
those of you in the States have a
great Thanksgiving since we'll
miss that but we'll be back that weekend that
Sunday with a new show so that's it
good night everybody, bye
see you next week
you
