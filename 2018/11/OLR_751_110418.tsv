27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	49000	Slow clap for Jason, that was amazing. Hi, it's Rob and welcome to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio here live with episode number 751 for this November the 4th of 2018. I of course am Rob Roberts, he is Techmaster Loki.
49000	54000	Hello. Hi Loki, how are you doing? I'm fine. Good, good. Good to have you back of course for another week.
54000	64000	Not here for another week, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Well, she will be joining us later thanks to Radio Magic, but sadly as you know her work schedule has her occupied otherwise for a little bit longer.
64000	74000	So we hope to welcome her back full time real soon. I know she'll pop in for a show later in the month in studio kind of like she was last week for our big 750th episode.
75000	90000	But now we're at 751, so only what 249 after tonight, then we hit 1000, then we're done, right? No podcast hits 1000 weekly episodes, right? Nobody's that crazy. I'm that crazy. Yes, you are that crazy.
90000	99000	Hello to all you crazy people who listen along with us, and I say that in the best possible way. Of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
100000	112000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Again, that's vognetwork.com where we have chatters like VidPower who ask, how many takes did it take to do that intro right?
112000	123000	I don't know. I didn't ask Jason. I do know that was his second script. He said he changed it. He said grab this new one, not the first one I used. So I bet I didn't catch all the differences.
123000	132000	Are you saying he flipped the script? He did. He flipped the script, but he can do that. It's this little creative thing we let him do because Jason does great jobs with the intro, as you heard tonight.
132000	139000	Brad from Pod Culture, of course, wants to know the question of the week. What did Loki bring to eat? You went to the fried chicken place again, right?
139000	147000	Yeah, I went to the fried chicken place. I got their chicken strips, which probably shouldn't have gotten those because those are just, they look like they're the ones that you find anywhere.
147000	160000	That they probably were frozen and they just threw them in a deep fryer. And they don't really have any dipping sauces aside from this generic ranch to go along with it. So it's just kind of bland.
160000	161000	But garlic fries.
161000	164000	But garlic fries are great. And the waffle is great.
165000	174000	We got a lot of gaming news to cover tonight, so let's just jump right in. We had a lot going on in gaming this week thanks to BlizzCon, which is always a huge convention.
174000	187000	Blizzard is a very large gaming company that makes games that have really changed the industry, like World of Warcraft, Diablo. Certainly a lot of people really love that series.
187000	188000	Rock and roll racing.
188000	196000	Absolutely, The Lost Vikings, Starcraft and what that did for competitive gaming, especially we know in Korea and stuff, Starcraft is a huge deal.
196000	204000	And of course Overwatch is really changing the game now in this day and age. Overwatch is really taking esports to another level thanks to the Overwatch League.
204000	212000	But lots of interesting stuff out of BlizzCon, right? This year's BlizzCon, not without controversy, which I'm sure you're all waiting for us to get into.
212000	217000	But let's make sure we talk about everything. So what did we get at BlizzCon this year, Loki?
217000	220000	Well we got announcements, announcements, and more announcements.
220000	223000	Well that's what they do at BlizzCon. You pay $200 to go hear announcements.
223000	227000	Yes. So new expansion for World of Warcraft?
227000	232000	Sorta. I know you don't play well. It's a patch expansion.
232000	237000	Whatever. Patch expansion. You get it for free.
238000	243000	Ok, so we're gonna talk a lot tonight about language in marketing.
243000	246000	Cause you all know what this is gonna come down to.
246000	251000	But this is one reason why. So Blizzard tricked you just the way they want to trick you.
251000	260000	You thought it was a new expansion, but it's not. It's just a new patch that they give a fancy name to that's part of the Battle for Azeroth expansion.
260000	262000	But it makes it sound like, oh it's this whole new thing.
262000	268000	And it does bring new stuff to the game. Certainly if you're a World of Warcraft fan, you are very much looking forward to it.
268000	275000	I'm sure WoW based shows like Girls Gone WoW here on this very network will spend much time talking about this new patch.
275000	284000	But it is not what we would usually consider a new expansion, meaning retail release, box, $60 price tag, that whole type of thing.
284000	290000	It's just the newest patch. And considering the Battle for Azeroth is very story heavy.
290000	296000	A lot of people kind of want to know where the story is gonna go. And who the new allied races are gonna be and all that stuff.
296000	301000	Anyway, I won't bore you with all those details. Cause I know we have a lot of people that don't play WoW here on this show.
301000	305000	But it's more stuff for the WoW fan base.
305000	311000	Yeah. They also announced the Warcraft 3 remaster that's gonna be coming out.
311000	314000	That has a lot of people excited. I don't think I've heard a negative thing about that.
314000	321000	That looks pretty awesome. 4K. And they even have another version of it that has some of the DLCs.
321000	325000	Or the expansion packs that they had from Warcraft 3.
325000	329000	Yeah, they kind of get into some of the story that you play out in World of Warcraft.
329000	334000	Kind of like how the Lich King came to be and all that. That was the Frozen Throne expansion in Warcraft 3.
334000	342000	As much as I know about Warcraft lore now, thanks to my time with World of Warcraft, I actually didn't play a lot of Warcraft 3 back in the day.
342000	348000	I don't even think I ever owned it. I think I had a person I used to date that owned it and I kind of played it that way.
348000	354000	But never really bought it myself. So I'm kind of interested in checking it out.
354000	358000	And you know a lot of stuff was born of Warcraft 3's mods.
358000	363000	Such as the modern lane based MOBA is born from Warcraft 3.
363000	367000	That's where Defense of the Ancients was the mod. Or Dota.
367000	371000	You ever wondered why Valve has Dota 2 and where the hell is Dota 1?
371000	375000	That's because Dota 1 was a mod for Warcraft 3.
375000	382000	Just like when Valve released Team Fortress 2, that's because the original Team Fortress was a Quake mod.
382000	390000	So Valve, at least for a while, they've been kind of quiet for a few years, but at least for a while was notorious for hiring the modding community to make new games.
390000	392000	Such as those examples.
392000	399000	So anyway, hopefully the mod support will be back in Warcraft 3 because that would be pretty exciting to play the original Defense of the Ancients and all that again.
399000	402000	It might be exciting. I don't think they talked a lot about that.
402000	406000	No. New character announced for Overwatch, Ashe.
406000	410000	Female McCree, kind of. But with a shotgun.
410000	413000	Basically McCree's antithesis, but female.
413000	420000	Voiced by Jennifer Hale, which is great because Jennifer Hale is a big name in the voice acting side of business.
420000	423000	She's done a lot of the BioWare, FemShep.
423000	427000	Our own Bobby Blackwolf is very proud of the bumper he has featuring Jennifer Hale.
427000	432000	I met her once at one of the many gamer exes, one of the ones she was at, and she's great.
432000	437000	A lot of people know who she is and it's kind of one of those, well it's about time they found a way to put her in Overwatch.
437000	442000	So win-win all around. I don't think anybody's upset about Ashe at all.
442000	445000	She has a shotgun, which I didn't realize really is.
445000	450000	I guess because I always kind of assumed that Roadhog's weapon was kind of like a shotgun, but it's really not.
450000	451000	It's more like a chaingun.
451000	454000	So yeah, I mean, makes a lot of sense.
454000	457000	We needed a shotgun hero in Overwatch, so now you got Ashe.
457000	459000	Doesn't Junkrat have...
459000	463000	No, because Junkrat uses all those grenades. His big thing is the grenade launcher.
463000	467000	I've literally played maybe an hour's worth of Overwatch.
467000	469000	It's fun, but...
469000	471000	I have it. I own the game.
471000	475000	Well then you're going to get Ashe because they don't charge for the character, so you'll get Ashe for free.
475000	476000	Alright.
476000	480000	Vidpower in chat says, thank you Overwatch team for the new female character.
480000	489000	Yeah, Blizzard got red to filth for some of their stereotypes and the way they presented characters several years ago.
489000	491000	Not enough jetpack, Kat.
491000	497000	And Overwatch has been a big change, and I think Blizzard has been applauded for that.
497000	501000	And yeah, I think some girl power's a great thing.
501000	507000	I did not pay attention if there was any updates to Heroes of the Storm. I assume that there was.
507000	514000	There was. They announced, actually the kind of big deal with Heroes of the Storm is that they have a brand new hero, Ophelia?
514000	517000	Ophelia? I'm butchering her name, but it's something like that.
517000	520000	But the twist is, she is not from a Blizzard game.
520000	525000	So, you know, Heroes of the Storm has always been about characters all from other Blizzard games.
525000	530000	Including tracers in there from Overwatch and Lucio and some of the big names from Overwatch are in there.
530000	536000	Then you have the monk from Diablo 3, the crusader, but they give him names.
536000	538000	The crusader is Johanna, they give him names.
538000	542000	So basically all of Blizzard's franchises, that's where all the characters come from.
542000	548000	And probably the deepest cut they did was when they put the lost Vikings in the game.
548000	550000	Because they had to make a new category for Blizzard Classic.
550000	553000	Well now you've got basically a character born from the Nexus.
553000	558000	So Blizzard has said, essentially we're going to start creating new characters.
558000	563000	So that's what they did with Ophelia. Sorry, I'm butchering her name.
563000	567000	But she's kind of like a dark mage, but she carries a big shield.
567000	575000	Interesting though because Blizzard still could have tapped from many different Overwatch characters if they wanted to.
575000	580000	I believe they're still missing some of the Diablo and Diablo 2 class representation.
580000	585000	I'm sure they could have put some of the new WoW characters like Princess Taraji.
585000	587000	Some of the characters they're introducing in Battle for Azeroth.
587000	589000	If they really wanted to, they could put some of the new.
589000	591000	But for whatever reason, this is the direction they want to go in.
591000	594000	But I mean, I've played a lot of Heroes of the Storm. I don't hate it.
594000	597000	It's interesting. Okay, sure. Let me do some new stuff.
597000	599000	And I don't know anything about Hearthstone either.
599000	603000	Honestly, I hope the Hearthstone fans don't get mad.
603000	607000	But it's basically par for the course that you get a new card expansion.
607000	609000	It's a new expansion, new cards.
609000	611000	The cards do some different things.
611000	613000	Overkill is a brand new thing that's going to be on the cards.
613000	616000	Which means you get a special effect if you overkill.
616000	620000	Meaning you use more points of damage than it would normally take to kill the character.
620000	622000	If you overkill, you'll kind of set off an extra mod.
622000	624000	Little things like that.
624000	631000	The expansion, if I remember right, is based on the Loa lore from Battle for Azeroth.
631000	633000	Which is explored with the trolls on the Horde side.
633000	635000	It's kind of like the gods they believe in.
635000	637000	I'll kind of leave it at that. I don't want to bore you with all the details.
637000	639000	But that's where Hearthstone is going with that.
640000	642000	And then, and then...
642000	645000	Wait, wait. Before you get to the big one. Wow Classic, right?
645000	647000	So they gave a date for World of Warcraft Classic.
647000	649000	It's going to be summer of 2019.
649000	651000	No, I had another big one.
651000	653000	Oh, okay. No, I know why I said before you get to the big one.
653000	655000	Well, no. There's another big one.
655000	656000	Oh, okay, okay.
656000	659000	They're invading your breakfast.
659000	661000	Oh, that is a big one.
663000	665000	Yeah, they dropped that on the pre-show stream.
665000	667000	I was surprised about that. Tell us more.
667000	670000	Yeah, so they're going to have, I don't remember what the cereal is called.
670000	673000	But it's basically Overwatch cereal.
675000	676000	And it's Lucio's.
676000	677000	Lucio's, yes.
677000	679000	Which they have referenced in the game before.
679000	682000	And I actually have a Lucio's shirt.
682000	683000	So, how funny.
683000	688000	Here I am thinking I was buying a shirt that's like an inside joke to Overwatch.
688000	690000	Because, you know, it's like a joke in the game.
690000	695000	And now, oh, I spent money on something that is now free advertising for Kellogg's.
695000	696000	That's great.
696000	698000	But no, I love that it's a real thing. It's funny.
698000	703000	Yeah, speaking of Kellogg's, I actually was able to pick up a box of Super Mario cereal today.
703000	705000	Oh, that still exists? You can actually get that?
705000	707000	Yeah, they have it over at WinCo now.
707000	708000	Oh, okay. Oh, shit.
708000	711000	I saw it because I've been looking for that and the kids saw that and I'm like,
711000	714000	sure, you can have this Lucky Charms knockoff. There you go.
714000	716000	That's the one with the cereal box amiibo, right?
716000	718000	They don't have that anymore.
718000	719000	It's just cereal now.
719000	721000	No wonder you can just overprice cereal now.
721000	724000	Yeah, well, you know the Lucio's is supposed to come with a loot box of some sort.
725000	730000	I don't know if it's a full loot box or a special loot box, but that cereal is going to be impossible to find.
730000	732000	So good luck.
733000	735000	It's going to be like that Super Mario cereal.
735000	737000	And I bet you, not that I would encourage this.
737000	740000	I don't encourage this, but I think it's going to happen anyway.
740000	746000	People are going to buy that Lucio cereal and flip it on eBay and flip it, you know, to get,
746000	749000	especially if the loot box has something unique in it, which I don't think it will.
749000	750000	I don't think they were saying anything about that.
750000	754000	I think it's just like a regular, you know, loot box that you get from like leveling up and stuff.
754000	759000	But yeah, I can really see people trying to flip that cereal, which is kind of interesting.
759000	760000	Ridiculous.
760000	762000	But I love that Lucio's are a real thing.
765000	770000	And then, okay, so I guess we'll get into the announcements.
770000	771000	Yes, please.
771000	773000	So the new Diablo announcements.
773000	776000	So the Diablo 3 switch that came out finally.
776000	779000	It was the same day as the start of BlizzCon.
779000	785000	So, I mean, that was kind of like their big, like, hey, if you want to check out Diablo 3 on Switch, you can starting today.
785000	788000	And then now it's Diablo, the next Diablo.
788000	790000	And everyone's like, whoa, what is that? What is that?
790000	796000	And they're like, you know, in the same vein of Command and Conquer, we're going mobile.
796000	800000	It's Diablo immortal, folks.
800000	802000	What's that look for?
802000	804000	Don't you guys have phones?
804000	805000	Come on.
805000	811000	Don't you use your cell phones and you're talking and you're Twittering and you're Facebooking and Instagram.
811000	816000	You assholes are all on social media right now tweeting about how much you hate me on your phone.
816000	818000	A phone you can use to play Diablo Immortal.
818000	821000	I actually, I got to say, I kind of felt bad for that guy.
821000	825000	Like, he kind of looked like he had a little bit of stage fright going on.
825000	832000	Like there was some weird stuff was happening with the BlizzCon opening, like, because like the sound on the Hearthstone stage didn't work.
832000	840000	So they were clearly having to like shuffle it on the fly because they did the Warcraft 3 thing and then they went back to Hearthstone.
840000	842000	So they kind of had to like do it out of order a little bit.
842000	844000	So I think everybody was like a little thrown off from that.
844000	848000	But like, he just looked very like there was parts of it that was like deer in headlights.
848000	854000	And like, I'm not, I'm not here to personally make fun of somebody whose job it is to probably make games.
854000	860000	And, you know, the fact that he has to, you know, get up on the stage is, you know, not everybody can do it.
860000	863000	And for the most part, he did a good job.
863000	867000	But I think we all have seen the part where he kind of put his foot in his mouth a little bit when he was like,
867000	869000	well, don't y'all have phones when?
869000	876000	Yes, but that doesn't mean we're all here at BlizzCon because we're fans of mobile games.
876000	877000	So, yeah.
877000	879000	Anything else you want to say on this, Loki?
879000	881000	Because I get a book.
881000	883000	Yeah, everybody, I got it like a 15 minute rant on this.
883000	890000	I hear, based on what's been seen of it so far, the company it's making, because it isn't actually Blizzard that's developing the game.
890000	891000	It's another company, I think.
891000	892000	Yeah.
892000	896000	And the company that, they have a game that's basically a knockoff of Diablo.
896000	903000	And it's like, they're saying that this looks like a knockoff of Diablo, except it's an official Diablo game.
903000	906000	But it resembles a knockoff of Diablo.
906000	909000	So take that as you will.
910000	913000	Alright, so let's talk about this whole debacle.
913000	920000	Because we've seen, just the internet has just exploded with a lot of negativity around this game.
920000	925000	And, you know, actually it wasn't just on the internet, some of it was happening in person.
925000	931000	Somebody had the balls to get up there in front of everybody and ask the question,
931000	934000	is this an April Fool's joke?
934000	938000	You know, completely stone faced, you know, to the developer's face to ask that type of question.
938000	940000	This is just some type of April Fool's joke.
940000	948000	And like, okay, I understand that you feel very like, you know, wronged or whatever by what happened.
948000	955000	But like, I couldn't help but feel like, dude, you paid $200 to be at BlizzCon.
955000	958000	And I just had that DJ Khalid in my mind.
958000	962000	Khalid, I had him in my mind where that, congrats, you played yourself.
962000	968000	Like that's honestly like the image that came to my mind is like, you paid $200 to Blizzard
968000	971000	so you could go there and just like ask something kind of like,
971000	975000	why are you even at the panel if you're not like feeling the game?
975000	978000	Did you just go to be rude?
978000	982000	Like it's so, I don't know, like it just, that left a bad taste in my mouth.
982000	987000	But to be fair, the response wasn't exactly great either.
987000	990000	What if the response had been something more like this?
990000	996000	Ask me the question, Logan. Pretend you are angry, you are angry dude over free mobile game.
996000	999000	Ask me the question, I'm going to pretend I'm developer from Diablo.
999000	1002000	Is this like an April Fool's joke or something like that?
1002000	1004000	I mean, where's the real game?
1004000	1007000	No, no, it's not a joke.
1007000	1011000	Look, here's the thing is that as we announced online a couple weeks ago,
1011000	1014000	we have multiple Diablo projects in development right now.
1014000	1017000	And we know our PC fans are not going to be disappointed.
1017000	1020000	But what we're trying to do right now is we're trying to grow our market
1020000	1023000	into other places where mobile phone gaming is really big.
1023000	1026000	I mean, after all, everybody does have a mobile phone,
1026000	1029000	so we want you to be able to take this Diablo experience on the go.
1029000	1032000	And we think this is something that can hold you over until the next big Diablo experience.
1032000	1036000	Wow, that is a great response and not at all, you know, entitled.
1038000	1040000	So would that response have been better, Logan?
1040000	1043000	That would have been better than what they did.
1043000	1044000	Exactly.
1044000	1047000	But then again, much like we've learned with Office Space,
1047000	1051000	sometimes the developers aren't the best people to be talking directly to the public.
1051000	1056000	Right, and the difference between me and him, to his credit,
1056000	1061000	I have 15 plus years of making shit up on the spot and having dialogue
1061000	1064000	thanks to this little program called Orange Lounge Radio.
1064000	1071000	This person probably had media training, which probably doesn't cover quite all the bases.
1071000	1074000	So while we're talking about messaging and while we're roleplaying
1074000	1079000	this Rob Roberts runs Blizzard scenario here, how about this, Loki?
1079000	1083000	How do you think maybe the message would have been different if,
1083000	1085000	and I ask everybody in chat this as well.
1085000	1089000	Actually, I want to see if there's any comments there in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1089000	1092000	ActDev says, Rob for Blizzard PR.
1092000	1097000	My worries, and this is also a worry that people have with the fact that it's a mobile game,
1097000	1102000	is that they're thinking that Activision is running this ship basically.
1102000	1105000	And Activision, when it comes to free-to-play models,
1105000	1108000	or even not free-to-play models, but treating them as free-to-play models,
1108000	1112000	they milk the fucking shit out of that.
1112000	1118000	All of the things that you hate about mobile games will be in this mobile game,
1118000	1120000	is what their fear is.
1120000	1123000	And looking at EA, same thing.
1123000	1126000	EA did the same shit with Command & Conquer, and they thought,
1126000	1130000	what, why are you guys angry? We gave you a new Command & Conquer, what the hell?
1130000	1131000	Right.
1131000	1133000	You know, it's just tone deaf, I guess.
1133000	1137000	Well, and let's, if we're going to run with this whole,
1137000	1140000	Rob is going to run Blizzard PR for a minute,
1140000	1143000	how would you guys feel if BlizzardCon had gone like this?
1143000	1147000	Instead of Diablo Immortal being the last announcement,
1147000	1150000	Warcraft III Remastered is the last announcement.
1150000	1152000	I haven't heard anything negative about the Warcraft III Remastered thing.
1152000	1154000	Have you heard anything negative about Warcraft III Remastered?
1154000	1155000	Nope.
1155000	1158000	So you can get away with remastering a game that's a classic game
1158000	1161000	that most people really like, and doing that in 4K and modernizing it,
1161000	1163000	and I think people are going to be okay with that.
1163000	1166000	So, first things first, we're going to make Warcraft III Remastered
1166000	1167000	the last announcement.
1167000	1170000	So before that, we'll get into Diablo.
1170000	1172000	And so I'm going to be the dude that comes up on stage,
1172000	1174000	and I'm going to start it off something like this.
1174000	1178000	Hey everybody, and welcome, hope you're having a wonderful BlizzCon,
1178000	1181000	and we have a lot of exciting stuff going on in the Diablo universe.
1181000	1184000	You know, we wrote an open letter to all of you a few weeks ago
1184000	1188000	that talked about that we have many Diablo products in the works,
1188000	1192000	and we have several, but I'm here to talk to you about the first one
1192000	1193000	that you can expect today.
1193000	1196000	This project is called Diablo Immortal,
1196000	1199000	and it's actually a special, unique Diablo experience
1199000	1201000	developed for mobile phones.
1201000	1205000	You know, everybody has a mobile phone, and mobile phones are growing,
1205000	1210000	and we want to invite everybody to participate in the Diablo experience,
1210000	1213000	because this is a universe we want everybody to enjoy.
1213000	1217000	You know, show the trailer, show the hype, you know, build all that stuff,
1217000	1218000	and then continue.
1218000	1222000	Diablo Immortal is actually playable on the show floor today,
1222000	1225000	and we hope you'll all have a chance to play it.
1225000	1229000	And I hope to be back real soon to talk to you about what's next for Diablo,
1229000	1232000	because I know what you're all waiting for.
1234000	1236000	Right? How's that? How's that?
1236000	1237000	Much better.
1237000	1239000	Much better, thank you.
1239000	1243000	So, a lot of that is in the messaging, right?
1243000	1249000	And this is a very, like, this whole way this is blown up and everything
1249000	1253000	is a very interesting study in like Blizzard,
1253000	1256000	and like messaging in general, not just like Blizzard specifically,
1256000	1259000	but this is the type of thing that like video game PR people
1259000	1263000	are going to study for a long, long time.
1263000	1267000	Because Blizzard's fan base, as we've talked about on OLR before,
1267000	1270000	is a very, like, usually loyal fan base.
1270000	1273000	I mean, you know, I think part of the reason that Overwatch took off
1273000	1277000	in the first place is that all these people who usually wouldn't play
1277000	1281000	first person shooters did it because Blizzard did it.
1281000	1284000	And Blizzard made a version of it that was very accessible
1284000	1288000	that people wanted to play, and I think that got people very excited.
1288000	1293000	I think Blizzard did make an error in assuming that their company
1293000	1298000	that has been founded around these PC, primarily, I think it's fair,
1298000	1301000	yes, of course they have console releases too,
1301000	1303000	but those are usually the sideshows, right?
1303000	1305000	Most of their releases are PC.
1305000	1307000	They've always been a very PC-based company.
1307000	1310000	The fact that, you know, their tentpole announcement of BlizzCon
1310000	1314000	essentially was, well, you PC fans, guess what?
1314000	1317000	We've got a mobile game for you, and it's actually a PC game
1317000	1319000	that you all know and love from PC.
1319000	1321000	We're putting it on a mobile device.
1321000	1323000	And I think that's why a lot of people are very like,
1323000	1326000	like, if the project had been something like,
1326000	1329000	and I know you're all going to laugh at me, but I don't give a fuck,
1329000	1332000	like Diablo Go, like something like Pokemon Go
1332000	1337000	or something that is just not Diablo 3 looking on a cell phone,
1337000	1340000	it'd been like a completely different type of game,
1340000	1344000	I wonder if people would have had the same very negative reaction to it.
1344000	1345000	Probably, yeah.
1345000	1347000	But here's the other thing with that.
1347000	1351000	I'm not going to completely say that Blizzard is 100% in the wrong here,
1351000	1356000	because, I mean, it does make a lot of sense to do mobile phone games.
1356000	1359000	There's a lot of companies making a lot of money off of mobile games.
1359000	1363000	I do think Diablo as a mobile game is probably an idea
1363000	1365000	that would have been better about three, four years ago,
1365000	1368000	but this is where Blizzard's slow development calendar
1368000	1370000	to take the time to get everything right,
1370000	1371000	this is one of those, I hate to say it,
1371000	1373000	this is one of those places where that kind of hurts them, I think,
1373000	1376000	is that they're a little late to the party with Diablo Immortal.
1376000	1379000	Whatever, I mean, that's actually not the biggest sin,
1379000	1382000	so you're a little late to the game, whatever.
1382000	1388000	I do think, though, that a lot of people are really kidding themselves
1388000	1390000	when they talk about how much they hate this game,
1390000	1393000	because here's the reality, this is a free game,
1393000	1396000	all these haters out there and stuff, they're going to download it,
1396000	1398000	they're going to try it, you can tell me all you want,
1398000	1400000	nah, nah, nah, I'm not going to, yes you are.
1400000	1402000	You're going to try it because it's free.
1402000	1404000	I'm not saying the game's going to be successful,
1404000	1406000	I'm not saying the game's going to make oodles of money,
1406000	1410000	but I seem to remember when Nintendo first announced Miitomo,
1410000	1412000	and then subsequently Super Mario Run,
1412000	1414000	there was a little bit of negativity on those games as well.
1414000	1416000	You know what, a lot of people downloaded those games anyway.
1416000	1421000	Now, to be fair, I also realized that Super Mario Run
1421000	1423000	ended up kind of getting a lot of flack,
1423000	1425000	and Nintendo did not consider that game a success
1425000	1428000	because just because of the fact people downloaded it
1428000	1431000	didn't mean that people ended up dropping the $10
1431000	1433000	to actually buy the levels.
1433000	1435000	So it's like Super Mario Run had a ton of people
1435000	1437000	that downloaded it for free to check it out,
1437000	1440000	and then very few of that actually converted over.
1440000	1442000	So I'm not saying necessarily that Diablo Immortal
1442000	1444000	is going to be this runaway success of a game,
1444000	1446000	but I do think there's a lot of people out there
1446000	1449000	that are kidding themselves when they say they're not even going to try it.
1449000	1451000	Sorry, I don't believe it.
1451000	1456000	So, you know, maybe people will now go further out of spite or whatever,
1456000	1458000	but the reality is it's free.
1458000	1460000	There's going to be at least a lot of people who downloaded
1460000	1463000	to tell their friends, oh, I played it and it sucks.
1463000	1467000	I don't know. Maybe it won't suck? I don't know.
1467000	1472000	You know, I would be kind of a hypocrite to sit here and say,
1472000	1475000	I'm going to hate this game just because it's a mobile game
1475000	1478000	when I spend all the time I do playing things like
1478000	1483000	Ingress, Pokemon Go, and I responded pretty favorably
1483000	1486000	to Nintendo's latest offering, which is more of an original game.
1486000	1490000	Dragalia Lost is actually not a bad mobile game at all.
1490000	1495000	So I'm not necessarily ready to write Diablo off completely
1495000	1497000	because it's a mobile game.
1497000	1500000	I just think their messaging, all they had to do,
1500000	1504000	all they had to do, Loki, just show a logo for Diablo IV.
1504000	1506000	Just show the fucking logo for Diablo IV. That's it.
1506000	1508000	Pull a Nintendo.
1508000	1509000	Why not?
1509000	1510000	Sure.
1510000	1512000	Pull a Bethesda.
1512000	1514000	What did Bethesda do?
1514000	1515000	What did Bethesda do?
1515000	1517000	And they're not getting Reddit for this at all.
1517000	1520000	Bethesda announced that the next Elder Scrolls game
1520000	1522000	is going to be a mobile game.
1522000	1525000	It's a mobile game that they're going to put on PlayStation 4 and Switch, yes.
1525000	1527000	But the next Elder Scrolls game is a mobile game.
1527000	1531000	Did you all forget Bethesda just did a similar thing at E3
1531000	1534000	and did not get dragged over the coals for this?
1534000	1537000	Bethesda announced their next Elder Scrolls,
1537000	1539000	this big series where everybody's waiting for the next one,
1539000	1541000	is a mobile game.
1541000	1543000	But the reason why they didn't get fucking dragged,
1543000	1546000	because what did they immediately, immediately follow it up with?
1546000	1548000	What was the very next announcement?
1548000	1551000	Well, a couple that star...
1551000	1554000	I'm using hyperbole. What was the next announcement?
1554000	1555000	Elder Scrolls VI.
1555000	1556000	Elder Scrolls VI.
1556000	1560000	And all they did was they showed, like, a painting,
1560000	1563000	a little drumbeat, and the Elder Scrolls VI logo.
1563000	1566000	And you know that game ain't fucking coming out for years.
1566000	1569000	And it'll still be buggy when it's released.
1569000	1572000	Yet, did anybody give that mobile Elder Scrolls shit?
1572000	1574000	Nope.
1574000	1576000	Now, I'm sure some will want to argue,
1576000	1579000	but the mobile thing doesn't look like a reskin of an existing game,
1579000	1583000	but we're getting in the weeds a little bit here, okay?
1583000	1587000	I'm saying is that messaging is, like, really important.
1587000	1589000	That's my point, okay?
1589000	1592000	I don't really know this Diablo game truly, truly,
1592000	1594000	until I actually get my hands on it to play it.
1594000	1598000	So anyway, little rant there.
1598000	1599000	All right.
1599000	1604000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1604000	1605000	DungeonBuster in chat says,
1605000	1608000	I'm not surprised that Blizzard did this with Diablo.
1608000	1611000	In a way, it was kind of inevitable.
1611000	1613000	Let's see, DungeonBuster also says,
1613000	1614000	Blizzard needs to make money,
1614000	1616000	and that money is going to be used to fund other projects
1616000	1617000	that they will be working on.
1617000	1620000	Hopefully, one of those projects will be on better messaging.
1620000	1622000	As H2O 100 Matt points out,
1622000	1624000	Hearthstone got so much shit when it was announced,
1624000	1628000	it got 25 million downloads within the first three months of its release.
1628000	1629000	Let's see, Tigerclaw says,
1629000	1630000	Here's an idea.
1630000	1633000	Make a new StarCraft or a new sequel one of their classic games.
1633000	1635000	How about a new Lost Vikings?
1635000	1637000	Well, I mean, to be fair, Tigerclaw,
1637000	1642000	I think the Warcraft III remaster is kind of where they're headed.
1642000	1645000	I mean, Blizzard has a classics game division at this point,
1645000	1647000	and I don't think this will be the last remaster.
1647000	1651000	I really truly believe one of the other projects they're working on right now
1651000	1653000	is a Diablo remaster,
1653000	1658000	because they said they had multiple Diablo products in development.
1658000	1660000	One of them is Diablo IV, duh.
1660000	1662000	One of them is a Diablo remaster.
1662000	1664000	It's just a question, is it Diablo I or Diablo II?
1664000	1668000	Probably Diablo II, but we'll see, I suppose.
1668000	1673000	Well, that's why they did Warcraft III and not Warcraft I or II.
1673000	1675000	DungeonBuster, with my analogy there,
1675000	1677000	saying Bethesda did that totally right.
1677000	1679000	Let's see, BobbyBlackWolf says,
1679000	1681000	Maybe Blizzard should have learned from the massive boycott
1681000	1684000	they got over having colors in Diablo III.
1684000	1687000	I don't remember, I mean, that was a crippling boycott.
1687000	1689000	I think whole tens of people didn't buy it.
1689000	1693000	I do remember that one BlizzCon in particular,
1693000	1695000	the big announcement at the very end
1695000	1697000	was that the Demon Hunter is coming to Diablo III.
1697000	1700000	That was the final announcement at one of the BlizzCons.
1700000	1703000	So, I don't know.
1703000	1707000	Like, maybe they need to reapproach the expectations
1707000	1709000	they're setting for BlizzCon?
1709000	1711000	I don't know.
1711000	1714000	I feel like the one year I went to BlizzCon,
1714000	1716000	do you know what the tentpole announcement was?
1716000	1718000	Overwatch, okay?
1718000	1721000	That was the best year to go to BlizzCon, honestly,
1721000	1724000	as far as press conferences and unveilings go,
1724000	1727000	because not only was it this brand new Blizzard property
1727000	1729000	and everybody was fucking psyched about it,
1729000	1732000	but they had that whole Pixar quality movie trailer thing
1732000	1733000	that kicked it off.
1733000	1734000	That was a beautiful year.
1734000	1736000	That was a beautiful thing to see in person.
1736000	1741000	It's interesting how high and low
1741000	1743000	the various BlizzCons can go.
1743000	1744000	Alright.
1744000	1746000	Bobby Blackwool says,
1746000	1748000	Rob has the shirt with the rainbows and unicorns
1748000	1749000	around the Diablo III logo.
1749000	1751000	I don't, actually.
1751000	1754000	I want that shirt, but I don't have it.
1754000	1756000	I did.
1756000	1757000	Oh, no you don't.
1757000	1759000	No, I have a similar one that says,
1759000	1762000	I'm dead inside, with the unicorns and the rainbows
1762000	1763000	and all that stuff.
1763000	1764000	It just says I'm dead inside.
1764000	1766000	I've worn that to host Rocky Horror before,
1766000	1768000	but I do not have a Diablo III.
1768000	1771000	And it was my icon on the VoG forums was that thing,
1771000	1772000	when we had those,
1772000	1775000	but I actually never did get that shirt,
1775000	1776000	although I wanted it.
1776000	1779000	Oh, and Bobby's reminding me it was a huge boycott
1779000	1781000	because there were colors in Diablo III
1781000	1783000	and it wasn't drab and dark like Diablo should be.
1783000	1785000	Well, here's the thing, guys,
1785000	1787000	and maybe we'll kind of end on this note
1787000	1789000	and then we can move on with the show,
1789000	1792000	is that I don't, like, here's the thing,
1792000	1794000	like, with all the hate and stuff
1794000	1795000	that Blizzard's getting right now,
1795000	1800000	I feel like Blizzard is a little more open to feedback
1800000	1801000	than a lot of other companies.
1801000	1804000	I feel like Blizzard is really gonna go back to their,
1804000	1806000	like, Blizzard's not stupid, you guys.
1806000	1808000	Blizzard's gonna go back Monday morning
1808000	1810000	and they're gonna really ask themselves,
1810000	1811000	what the fuck happened?
1811000	1814000	That's, I can just imagine right now,
1814000	1815000	they're all getting in a room.
1815000	1818000	There goes Jay Allen, the guy running it,
1818000	1820000	Wyatt, the Diablo guy,
1820000	1822000	all the guys, the big guys you saw at BlizzCon,
1822000	1823000	they're all gonna be sitting around a room
1823000	1825000	Monday morning, shut the door, thank you.
1825000	1828000	Okay, what the fuck happened?
1828000	1831000	That's gonna be a conversation
1831000	1834000	8.30 a.m. at Blizzard headquarters tomorrow morning.
1834000	1838000	So, they're gonna really try to reevaluate
1838000	1840000	and work on some of that messaging,
1840000	1844000	but I just think, I think it was a bad idea
1844000	1846000	to not immediately remind people
1846000	1848000	there are many Diablo products in development
1848000	1849000	and this is one of them.
1849000	1852000	I know Blizzard tried to put out a letter online
1852000	1854000	to reduce some of those expectations.
1854000	1857000	That wasn't, clearly it wasn't enough.
1857000	1859000	They needed to reiterate it on stage.
1859000	1863000	What is their fear about saying the words
1863000	1865000	Diablo 4 on stage?
1865000	1867000	Are they worried that they might ultimately
1867000	1868000	cancel it or something?
1868000	1871000	Like, how is Blizzard not going to make a Diablo 4,
1871000	1872000	eventually?
1872000	1875000	This is, I don't know, very strange.
1875000	1876000	But anyway, I do think Blizzard
1876000	1878000	is gonna hear some of this feedback
1878000	1881000	and I think we may end up seeing,
1881000	1883000	I think there's a very strong possibility
1883000	1885000	this thing does not stay exclusive to mobile
1885000	1888000	because we know that mobile-type games like,
1888000	1891000	oh fuck, I don't know, Jetpack Joyride and stuff
1891000	1895000	will come out on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.
1895000	1898000	So, maybe the ultimate thing that happens with this
1898000	1901000	is that Diablo Immortal ends up on consoles as well.
1901000	1904000	I think there's a very distinct, and maybe even PC.
1904000	1906000	I think there's a very distinct possibility that happens.
1906000	1908000	I'm not gonna say that it's not gonna be filled
1908000	1910000	with microtransactions and all that stuff all of a sudden,
1910000	1912000	but I'm just saying that it's a very unique possibility
1912000	1916000	that they end up not making this mobile exclusive.
1916000	1917000	I don't know.
1917000	1919000	But their third-party partnership,
1919000	1921000	I think that's what makes it a little bit trickier
1921000	1923000	because I'm not sure their third-party partner
1923000	1925000	develops for those type of things.
1925000	1926000	So, I don't know.
1926000	1929000	Anyway, Tigerclaw points out Hearthstone was a mobile game,
1929000	1931000	then got ported to consoles.
1931000	1935000	I actually, you're kind of a little wrong.
1936000	1938000	You think it was a mobile game.
1938000	1943000	Originally, it was an iPad and PC release, or tablet.
1943000	1946000	The mobile came later because they had to condense
1946000	1948000	the interface down for mobile.
1948000	1950000	It was actually originally for tablets
1950000	1953000	when people were talking more about iPads
1953000	1956000	and that sort of thing more often, which, for whatever reason,
1956000	1958000	we don't really talk about tablet PCs and Macs
1958000	1960000	as much as we used to, which is interesting.
1960000	1962000	But I do seem to remember the original release of that
1962000	1964000	was on tablets and PC.
1966000	1967000	Let's see.
1967000	1968000	Dark Tetsuya says,
1968000	1970000	I don't know what I heard on the YouTube trailers.
1970000	1971000	Comments are getting deleted.
1971000	1973000	They even re-uploaded one of the trailers
1973000	1975000	to try and stave off the downvotes,
1975000	1976000	but I don't believe it worked out.
1976000	1978000	Well, of course it didn't work out.
1978000	1980000	We all know Streisand Effect,
1980000	1982000	and that whole thing is in full effect.
1982000	1985000	You cannot remove that type of negativity from the internet,
1985000	1987000	and I don't know who they're kidding.
1987000	1991000	But Blizzard probably handles PR companies to do a lot of this,
1991000	1996000	and it's probably what the PR company's trying to do to save face.
1996000	1997000	I don't freaking know.
1997000	2001000	But all I know is that I would expect within a month,
2001000	2003000	probably less,
2003000	2006000	Blizzard's going to have a big something to say about this.
2006000	2009000	And honestly, a lot of it's probably just going to be a reiteration
2009000	2011000	of the letter they already wrote.
2011000	2014000	This is one of many Diablo products in the works.
2014000	2017000	So please look forward to it, I suppose.
2017000	2018000	All right.
2018000	2020000	Anyway, Rama in chat says,
2020000	2023000	Diablo Mobile will end up on Switch, 3DS, and Vita.
2023000	2025000	Oh, Rama, nothing's coming out for the Vita.
2025000	2026000	I was going to say, what's a Vita?
2026000	2028000	Nothing's going to come out for the Vita anymore.
2028000	2030000	In Japan, maybe. I don't know.
2030000	2032000	I think they've killed the support there, too.
2032000	2036000	Not really, because we still see releases on the Vita calendar.
2036000	2037000	Sony's official.
2037000	2038000	Yeah, Sony's official.
2038000	2041000	Hey, as long as people are buying the games, they'll make them.
2041000	2045000	But yeah, I think it's going to start scaling way back in Japan pretty soon.
2045000	2047000	I think that's going to be about the end of it.
2047000	2050000	Rama reminds me that's the joke. Yes, I know, I know.
2050000	2052000	All right, let's get into our gaming weeks.
2052000	2054000	And then I'm going to invite a special guest on the show
2054000	2056000	to talk about his gaming week.
2056000	2059000	So, Loki, why don't you talk to us a little bit about your gaming week.
2059000	2060000	How was your gaming week?
2060000	2065000	Well, I did some streaming on Twitch of DDR Extreme.
2065000	2068000	I originally had planned on upgrading my machine,
2068000	2073000	well, maybe downgrading my machine to a fourth plus.
2073000	2078000	However, the CD drive that I got, while it is good for, actually,
2078000	2086000	the DVD drive that I have is good enough to run the games that I have,
2086000	2088000	it's not good enough to run the Super Disk,
2088000	2092000	so I have a new drive coming in its place.
2092000	2096000	But at least I was able to replace that without breaking anything,
2096000	2100000	and I got to take apart the 573 board and stuff like that.
2101000	2104000	So that'll be coming probably in a couple weeks.
2104000	2109000	I think they said deliver in the 19th, so about two weeks away.
2109000	2113000	And then I did get to play a little bit more Red Dead Redemption 2.
2113000	2116000	I still don't really know what the hell to do in that game.
2116000	2119000	I think I'm just probably going to go through the story.
2119000	2121000	I kind of want to get all the achievements and stuff
2121000	2123000	and then just cheat like crazy through it,
2123000	2125000	because that's where the fun is.
2127000	2128000	But I haven't quite gotten there yet.
2128000	2130000	But it's a very fun game still.
2130000	2137000	And then I did finally dust off my VR headset to play some VR games.
2137000	2142000	I did get enough time to play Tetris Effect, both in VR and in 4K.
2142000	2145000	So the 4K, you know, it looked good.
2145000	2147000	I prefer it in VR.
2147000	2151000	For me, it was easier to see the screen and just be able to,
2151000	2155000	even with the zoom function that they have in Tetris Effect,
2155000	2158000	it was just easier to see what I was doing.
2158000	2161000	And it was easier to appreciate some of the stuff that was going on around it.
2161000	2166000	It was kind of hard to notice some of the background changes and stuff in the 4K version,
2166000	2169000	which is weird, but I don't know.
2169000	2173000	I guess it was kind of meant for VR in the first place, so I'm down with that.
2173000	2177000	But with that being said, I still don't like the fact,
2177000	2180000	and I know Bobby can probably relate to this,
2180000	2189000	the stupid drifting thing where the screen will drift slightly to the left all the time.
2189000	2192000	And I get it that I can put my headset on the floor for a little bit,
2192000	2194000	and it's supposed to solve that problem.
2194000	2196000	And usually you can just reset your...
2196000	2199000	Yeah, Bobby was talking about that the Tetris Effect didn't have re-centering.
2199000	2200000	Exactly.
2200000	2203000	Well, now, to be fair, this could be a demo versus retail thing.
2203000	2204000	Right, right. I understand that.
2204000	2209000	But typically, even in demos for that stuff they have where you can re-center,
2209000	2210000	but I couldn't re-center it this way.
2210000	2215000	So I ended up having to turn almost 45 degrees to the left to see the screen,
2215000	2217000	and it was ridiculous.
2217000	2224000	And at this point in time, the PlayStation VR has been out for what?
2224000	2225000	Like a year or two now?
2225000	2226000	Yeah, it's coming up on two years.
2226000	2229000	Why haven't they fixed this? Why?
2229000	2231000	Why haven't they fixed this yet?
2231000	2236000	This is ridiculous that this is still an issue this late in the game.
2236000	2237000	Fix your shit.
2237000	2238000	Why is this still a problem?
2238000	2240000	I know we're not the only ones having this problem.
2240000	2242000	Why can't this be fixed?
2242000	2246000	Or, hey, occasionally just have it drift to the right to offset, you know,
2246000	2248000	the fucking drifting to the left.
2248000	2251000	I don't understand why they can't just fix that shit.
2251000	2255000	So, yeah, that was my only gripe there, but it's a great game.
2255000	2260000	I look forward to the full version when I get that unlocked, I think, on Friday.
2260000	2262000	Yeah, it's really soon, right?
2262000	2263000	Not this week, but next, right?
2263000	2264000	No, it's this week.
2264000	2266000	Oh, shoot. Nice. Okay, cool.
2267000	2269000	Is that it for your gaming week?
2269000	2270000	That's it.
2270000	2271000	My gaming week?
2271000	2272000	Oh, at Pokemon Go.
2272000	2275000	I'm sorry, and I wanted to say I like the adventure sync thing,
2275000	2276000	because that's pretty cool.
2276000	2278000	I finally got the Fitbit thing to work, too,
2278000	2285000	and what's great is the Google Fit thing, it does not calculate steps very well.
2285000	2289000	It over calculates the steps, but that works in my favor when it comes to...
2289000	2291000	Well, and then it works in Niantic's favor, too,
2291000	2293000	because you're buying more incubators.
2293000	2294000	No, not really.
2294000	2298000	Well, I don't have to buy it. I never am buying Pokeballs now,
2298000	2301000	but all of a sudden when that kicked in, it's like,
2301000	2303000	oh, here, here's 30 Pokeballs.
2303000	2305000	I'm like, cool, I guess.
2305000	2306000	Nice.
2308000	2310000	Well, if that's it for you, then my gaming week...
2310000	2312000	All right, I'll start with Pokemon Go as well,
2312000	2314000	because you know nobody plays mobile games,
2314000	2317000	but I participated in the Gengar raid day on Saturday,
2317000	2319000	and I was very lucky this time.
2319000	2322000	My very first Gengar raid was shiny,
2322000	2325000	so I was like, cool, this never happens to me.
2325000	2329000	There's been some shiny days. I didn't get any on the Articuno day.
2329000	2332000	I didn't get any, so it was nice to just kind of have that out of the way.
2332000	2336000	I couldn't even tell it was shiny, because the difference is so subtle.
2336000	2339000	The only way I knew was the little special icon, and I was like...
2339000	2340000	Yeah, that's like...
2340000	2342000	And I also exclaimed loudly, I'm like, is this...
2342000	2344000	Because it did the little star thing when it showed up.
2344000	2346000	I was like, is this a shiny?
2346000	2348000	And then, of course, three people next to me were like, huh?
2348000	2350000	And looked at my phone, and one of my buddies tasked me,
2350000	2351000	yeah, it's a shiny, it's shiny.
2351000	2353000	And I was like, oh, shit, wow, cool.
2353000	2355000	I finally won the shiny lottery for a change.
2355000	2357000	So that was kind of nice.
2357000	2362000	So I did that. I did the Gengar day.
2362000	2364000	And then, of course, I stuck with it.
2364000	2366000	Alan ended up getting a shiny, too,
2366000	2372000	and we raid over in the business district not far from here in the next town over,
2372000	2376000	and then we kind of go throughout all those businesses and do all the gyms there.
2376000	2379000	So we kind of walk a big route that's maybe like 10 or 11.
2379000	2381000	I mean, we probably could do more gyms,
2381000	2383000	but most people want to stop after like 10
2383000	2386000	because they've burned their five free raid passes
2386000	2388000	and whatever maybe they had left over in their inventory.
2388000	2391000	I think I still have like 25 extra raid passes
2391000	2393000	because of all the boxes I bought for incubators.
2393000	2396000	So I'm more than happy to burn, burn, burn raid passes.
2396000	2398000	But anyway, I got my one shiny, so I'm happy there.
2398000	2401000	Other stuff, I've also played the Tetris Effect demo,
2401000	2405000	and I loved it. I really, really loved it.
2405000	2408000	I did a stream when I played it for the very first time.
2408000	2411000	So a cheap plug for my Twitch channel over at Rob Roberts.
2411000	2416000	I played that on Twitch, and yeah, I just love it so far.
2416000	2419000	I mean, I know it's just a demo, so I can't really give you my full thoughts,
2419000	2422000	but I'm really anxious to play more.
2422000	2426000	Like, I just, the immersion, the beauty of those,
2426000	2428000	even the three skins that were available.
2428000	2431000	Like, you know, obviously everybody loved that trailer song,
2431000	2432000	which is the first skin.
2432000	2434000	The second skin had a great song,
2434000	2437000	and it was interesting enough where the design of that
2437000	2439000	really kind of messes with your head.
2439000	2442000	How, like, the little lines in the block kind of go back and forth,
2442000	2443000	and they change colors.
2443000	2445000	I don't know about you, but that was really messing with me when I was playing.
2445000	2447000	So it was kind of neat.
2447000	2450000	And then that third stage with, you know, the fire and the drum beats
2450000	2452000	and the kakak and all that stuff,
2452000	2455000	and the stage would actually change,
2455000	2458000	and then as you're going, more and more people show up
2458000	2460000	to bow down to the Tetris thing and all that.
2460000	2462000	It was just really cool. It's just so well done.
2462000	2467000	It really is luminous meets Tetris, and that's fine.
2467000	2471000	That's what I wanted. That's great. Perfect.
2471000	2472000	If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
2472000	2475000	So, yeah, this is, so far I'm really loving it,
2475000	2478000	and I'm really excited for the retail release.
2478000	2482000	I unboxed the VR this week with the intention of playing the demo on VR,
2482000	2486000	but then ended up going to a movie and I just didn't get around to it.
2486000	2489000	But to be fair, I also have an unopened copy of Diablo 3 for Switch,
2489000	2491000	also waiting for me to go play.
2491000	2494000	So Tetris Effect in VR is not the only thing that I've been neglecting.
2494000	2497000	But I forgot how many parts there are for that PlayStation VR.
2497000	2499000	They have to, like, number everything.
2499000	2500000	It's not that many.
2500000	2501000	It seems, it's a lot.
2501000	2502000	It's not.
2502000	2504000	It's like leg bones connected to the ankle bone.
2504000	2508000	The ankle bone's putting together the PlayStation VR.
2508000	2509000	Let's see, what else?
2509000	2511000	I've still been playing World of Warcraft,
2511000	2515000	working on my alliance character that I boosted is now up to 116,
2515000	2519000	my Affliction Warlock, so still enjoying that,
2519000	2521000	and been playing that a bit.
2521000	2524000	And I guess, I guess that's really it for me to say.
2526000	2529000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundromaty
2529000	2533000	with vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, icon.
2533000	2535000	Yeah, that's it for my gaming week.
2535000	2539000	Go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2539000	2542000	S2100 Matt says, Shiny Gengar was so lame.
2542000	2543000	We're shiny.
2543000	2546000	It's Gengar with a gray Instagram filter.
2546000	2548000	Bobby Black Wolf says, Rob is talking about how much fun he's having,
2548000	2551000	and all I'm hearing is dead game, dead game, dead game, whatever.
2551000	2553000	How much money did he make last month?
2553000	2554000	Yeah, that's what I thought.
2554000	2557000	Anyway, we're going to break form a little bit here,
2557000	2559000	and we're going to invite a friend of ours to come on the show here
2559000	2561000	for a little bit to talk about his gaming week,
2561000	2565000	because I know there's a very kind of unique game,
2565000	2567000	new game that came out,
2567000	2570000	and I know our friend has some strong opinions on this,
2570000	2572000	and the more I was hearing about this game,
2572000	2575000	I was like, what in the hell is this?
2575000	2576000	And I want to talk about it.
2576000	2578000	So welcome to the show.
2578000	2581000	You know him from such shows as Ranger Pride.
2581000	2583000	Welcome back, Shane, to the network.
2583000	2584000	Hello.
2584000	2585000	Hey, Shane, how you doing?
2585000	2586000	I am fine.
2586000	2587000	It's good to hear from you.
2587000	2588000	What have you been up to lately?
2588000	2590000	I know your shows have been on a little bit of a hiatus,
2590000	2591000	but everything going on for you?
2591000	2596000	Well, I quit my show, so it didn't matter about what kind of hiatus it's on anymore.
2596000	2599000	Well, I bet your fans are very sad to hear that,
2599000	2602000	but you've got a lot of other stuff going on, right?
2602000	2604000	No, but that's okay.
2605000	2606000	All right.
2606000	2608000	You've got things going on like playing games, right?
2608000	2609000	How is your gaming week?
2609000	2613000	Oh, yeah, I'm up to nine shiny pincers right now in Pokémon GO.
2613000	2615000	You're up to nine shiny pincers?
2615000	2616000	Yes.
2616000	2617000	Wait.
2617000	2618000	I want to do more.
2618000	2619000	Everyone brace yourselves.
2619000	2620000	I'm going to piss Shane off.
2620000	2621000	Ready?
2621000	2622000	No, I already know.
2622000	2623000	I saw your Twitter post.
2623000	2624000	How many shiny Gengars did you get?
2624000	2625000	Zero.
2626000	2627000	Sorry.
2627000	2630000	Okay, the one time you don't get a shiny, Shane, let me have my moment.
2630000	2632000	I guess you could just trade one to him.
2632000	2633000	I don't have two of them.
2633000	2634000	I only got one.
2634000	2635000	Oh, okay.
2635000	2636000	Well, you should still trade it to me.
2636000	2637000	I don't think so.
2637000	2640000	But I got my one shiny pincer, so I'm happy.
2640000	2645000	But anyway, we've been criticized about talking about Pokémon GO too much on this podcast,
2645000	2646000	so I want to talk about a different game.
2646000	2649000	Pokémon GO is amazing, even if it's a crappy game like GO.
2649000	2651000	Well, then let's bring back PokéStop Podcast.
2651000	2652000	What do you say?
2654000	2656000	Potentially I could be down.
2656000	2657000	All right.
2657000	2658000	To be continued.
2658000	2659000	All right.
2659000	2661000	But anyway, you want to talk about a different game this week, right?
2661000	2665000	Well, you wanted me to talk about it, but I am more than happy to talk about it.
2665000	2666000	Okay.
2666000	2667000	That's what I thought.
2667000	2668000	That's what I thought.
2668000	2669000	So tell us about this game.
2669000	2670000	How is your game?
2670000	2672000	What have you been playing?
2672000	2679000	I decided I'm a masochist, and I purchased The Quiet Man.
2679000	2680000	The Quiet Man.
2680000	2681000	I've never...
2681000	2682000	Is that The Wicker Man?
2682000	2683000	A Quiet Place?
2683000	2684000	I don't know what that means.
2684000	2685000	What is this game?
2685000	2687000	It doesn't make sense to me.
2687000	2688000	It's a game...
2688000	2689000	I don't remember who makes it.
2689000	2696000	It's a fairly well-known developer, but it's published by Square Enix.
2696000	2700000	It came out of nowhere, I believe it was at E3, and it was just this weird-looking game
2700000	2706000	that had live-action video mixed in with regular PS4 graphics.
2706000	2708000	It looked like it beat them up.
2708000	2712000	Nobody knew what was going on, and people were intrigued and scared.
2712000	2718000	Mixing full motion video with games, isn't that something they did back when CD-ROM technology
2718000	2721000	was first out, like Phantasmagoria?
2721000	2722000	Is that basically what this is?
2722000	2724000	No, it's like...
2724000	2727000	You remember...
2727000	2730000	What's the game that's on Xbox?
2730000	2731000	Night Trap?
2731000	2733000	No, not Night Trap.
2733000	2735000	Alright, next time you're gonna tell a joke, have it ready to go.
2735000	2738000	It wasn't a joke, I was just referring...
2738000	2744000	It is a game I didn't play, but you liked it because it was half TV series, half...
2744000	2745000	Alan Wake.
2745000	2746000	Alan Wake.
2746000	2747000	No, this is nothing like that at all.
2747000	2748000	No, it's the other one.
2748000	2749000	Not Alan Wake.
2749000	2750000	The other game they did.
2750000	2751000	Remedy.
2751000	2752000	Quantum Break?
2752000	2753000	What?
2753000	2754000	Quantum Break?
2754000	2755000	Yes, Quantum Break.
2755000	2756000	Quantum Break, yes.
2756000	2757000	Thank you.
2757000	2760000	No, this again, nothing like that, because that was an amazing game.
2760000	2765000	No, I'm just saying that they're similar with the live-action and gameplay.
2765000	2768000	This game is crap.
2768000	2770000	I don't even know if I would say it's similar in that vein.
2770000	2772000	Let Shane talk.
2772000	2775000	Wow, you'll never hear Rob say that again.
2775000	2776000	That's true.
2776000	2778000	Enjoy this moment while it lasts.
2778000	2783000	Okay, so PlayStation Network had it on sale for a couple dollars cheaper, and I was like,
2783000	2784000	what the heck?
2784000	2789000	I'm kind of intrigued by this game, because I like games that are bad, but they're so
2789000	2791000	bad that they're good.
2791000	2793000	One of my all-time favorite games, Rising Xan.
2793000	2799000	That is a terrible game, but it is funny, it's not really that terrible to play, and
2799000	2801000	it's just one of my favorites.
2801000	2807000	This game is probably the worst game I've ever played in my life.
2807000	2809000	Why?
2809000	2815000	This game is worse than Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival, and that's not even a game, because
2815000	2820000	a little two-year-old can beat you at that game, in quote marks, because you don't do
2820000	2823000	anything.
2823000	2826000	Is it worse than Superman 64?
2826000	2829000	Yes, I'd rather play that.
2829000	2831000	Let me explain.
2831000	2838000	So the premise of this game, from what I can tell, is that you are this guy who happens
2838000	2844000	to be deaf, and you beat up people for the first half of the game.
2844000	2850000	Okay, this game is really racist, too, I think, because you don't get a lot of information
2850000	2855000	as to what's going on, because you're deaf, and the developers decided, well, then there
2855000	2858000	should be no audio in the game.
2858000	2864000	So you're playing the game, people are talking, it's not subtitled, I don't read lips, I'm
2864000	2867000	just guessing what's going on half the time.
2867000	2870000	It's an interesting artistic decision.
2870000	2872000	It's a premise that could work.
2872000	2875000	Yeah, I'm all for having a deaf protagonist.
2875000	2876000	Yeah, that's cool.
2876000	2879000	Yeah, it's an interesting twist, yeah.
2879000	2886000	Yeah, so the first half of the game, I'm beating up Hispanic gang members.
2886000	2887000	That's all I do.
2887000	2892000	There's four different models, four or five, and you just repeatedly beat them up.
2892000	2897000	And you have a couple techniques or buttons you can hit for different attacks.
2897000	2903000	The game doesn't tell you what each thing does, except in a little neon light picture.
2903000	2907000	Like, you can go to the controller select screen, or the control screen, rather, and
2907000	2914000	you'll hit square, and it'll show this neon sign of your guy punching, and then triangles
2914000	2916000	is the neon sign of your guy kicking.
2916000	2920000	No words or anything to really tell you what's going on, so some of the controls I still
2920000	2924000	don't understand, because I don't read neon light signs.
2924000	2928000	All those years of BeatMania 2DX and you don't read neon light signs?
2928000	2930000	No, no I don't.
2930000	2931000	Okay.
2931000	2936000	So, oh god, just where'd it go with this?
2936000	2943000	You beat those five same characters up in very generic places constantly, and it's
2944000	2950000	spliced in between some of the action sequences are flashbacks.
2950000	2956000	And your mom gets shot and killed by one of the gang members.
2956000	2957000	Well that's not very nice.
2957000	2962000	So you think, you guys aren't going to play, I don't care, I'm going to spoil everything.
2962000	2964000	This is a terrible game.
2964000	2968000	The gang members had nothing to do with it.
2968000	2972000	So when you're fighting, after you have that first flashback, occasionally, when you kill
2972000	2974000	an enemy, the screen slows down.
2974000	2980000	You still see your terribly animated character and the terribly animated enemies.
2980000	2987000	And then in the background, they try to overlay images, like these flashbacks are real people,
2987000	2989000	like real footage stuff.
2989000	2991000	They overlay that over the game screen.
2991000	2999000	So it's really jarring to see these poorly animated computer modeled characters fight
2999000	3007000	while really badly acted FMV is going on in the background of the apartment you're in.
3007000	3010000	It's really, really bad.
3010000	3015000	I mean, this question should be asked though, Shane.
3015000	3018000	And you probably won't understand this, but humor me, okay?
3018000	3020000	Is it like The Room bad?
3020000	3022000	I don't know what that is.
3022000	3027000	You know the movie The Room that's so bad that people, okay, or Showgirls bad?
3027000	3028000	I've never seen that on camera.
3028000	3032000	It's a movie that's so bad that it's actually kind of good when everybody sits around and
3032000	3033000	makes fun of it.
3033000	3038000	So here's what's fun about this game too, is there's like long cut scenes with people
3038000	3042000	talking that you can't understand it and there's no subtitles.
3042000	3044000	So you're watching two minutes of someone.
3044000	3047000	That's what really threw me the first time.
3047000	3052000	Now, I thought I heard something about that they were going to patch in audio or something
3052000	3053000	like that.
3053000	3054000	Like there's a patch coming from-
3054000	3055000	Who cares?
3055000	3057000	It's not going to make the game good.
3057000	3061000	The gameplay, you can hit the square button over and over and that's all you really need
3061000	3065000	to do for the most part to get through any area.
3065000	3071000	Because your character will kind of just randomly teleport somewhere to another enemy.
3071000	3073000	It's not even like there's a movement of your character.
3073000	3077000	He literally teleports right next to them.
3077000	3083000	Yeah, and like Loki was saying, the first time after you do the intro, you talk with
3083000	3084000	your friend.
3084000	3087000	Spoiler, he's the one that killed your mom so he's not your friend.
3087000	3088000	Oh my God, Shane.
3088000	3089000	You just like ruined the whole game.
3089000	3090000	It doesn't matter.
3090000	3091000	Nobody should play this game.
3091000	3093000	I'm trying to make sure they don't.
3093000	3102000	Like, it's a six or seven minute full cut scene of these actors talking and signing
3102000	3109000	with no sound, no subtitles, and you're just sitting there watching and making up your
3109000	3113000	own story at that point because it's way more interesting than what's going on.
3113000	3117000	Or if you're like my boyfriend, you kind of fall asleep during it because it's really
3117000	3118000	boring.
3118000	3122000	Or the best part where they just purposefully make it so that you don't understand the story.
3122000	3128000	There's one part where the protagonist is looking at a ransom note, but you're looking
3128000	3133000	at the ransom note from a camera angle behind his head so you can't see what's on the ransom
3133000	3138000	note because even though he's deaf, it doesn't mean that you can't read the ransom note to
3138000	3141000	be able to gain the knowledge of whatever it is that he's seeing.
3141000	3145000	They purposely make it so that it's impossible to follow the story.
3145000	3150000	One of my favorite parts though is shortly after that, you're talking to your friend
3150000	3151000	who's the bad guy.
3151000	3153000	Remember that everybody, so you don't play this.
3153000	3158000	Wasn't there like some cop guy or something that was also bad?
3158000	3159000	This is where it gets racist for that.
3159000	3161000	We'll get to that in a second.
3161000	3169000	But your friend is talking to you with his, like he's got his back turned to your character
3169000	3174000	and he says something to your character with his back turned to your character who is deaf
3174000	3180000	and your character responds by talking.
3180000	3184000	Is there going to be a twist maybe when they put in the dialogue that this whole thing
3184000	3189000	was this weird avant-garde art thing and that it actually makes a lot of sense when you
3189000	3191000	actually get dialogue later?
3191000	3194000	No, I don't think so.
3194000	3196000	I don't even care.
3196000	3198000	And that segues into my next point.
3198000	3202000	So first of all, super racist, the first half of the game you beat up on Hispanic guys,
3202000	3208000	the second half you beat up on black guys, and then your hero is this white cop.
3208000	3210000	I'm like, okay, this is hilarious.
3210000	3212000	Oh, you're trying to save a white woman too.
3212000	3217000	And you're like the most generic white guy ever.
3217000	3218000	It's so annoying.
3218000	3223000	So for every like avant-garde artistic decision, there's some pretty, pardon the pun,
3223000	3224000	tone deaf ones too.
3224000	3228000	And then for no reason, he turns into a magical bird man at the end.
3228000	3229000	Yes.
3229000	3230000	Okay.
3230000	3231000	Yes.
3231000	3238000	So that was the only okay part of the entire game when I got to that point because my homework
3238000	3241000	for this call was to beat the game and I did not succeed.
3241000	3242000	And I'll tell you why.
3242000	3243000	So I got to that point.
3243000	3244000	It was kind of fun.
3244000	3246000	Like you were overpowered.
3246000	3250000	It was some neat little attacks that lasted like for five minutes.
3250000	3252000	It got really boring really quick.
3252000	3254000	And then you have to go beat up on your friend again.
3254000	3256000	And I did that.
3256000	3261000	And once I beat up on him, I think something failed to trigger like a cut scene or something
3261000	3263000	and I couldn't progress.
3263000	3266000	I had to turn off my game, started back over.
3266000	3270000	It put me about 40 minutes back and I said, I'm done.
3270000	3272000	This game is so bad.
3272000	3273000	I just don't care anymore.
3273000	3275000	I'm going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3275000	3279000	MXC is apparently following the saga and says, yes, there will be sound,
3279000	3281000	but when they add it as a patch in a week.
3281000	3282000	I thought that was a thing.
3282000	3284000	So you got to play it again when they do audio?
3284000	3285000	Nope.
3285000	3290000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, and it's disappointing to hear how terrible this is.
3290000	3292000	I mean, how often do you hear about a new IP?
3292000	3296000	Well, this is a new IP that costs $15, right?
3296000	3298000	Like, yeah, I got for like 13 because it was on sale.
3298000	3302000	So clearly they knew something was wrong.
3302000	3303000	Okay.
3303000	3307000	I liken this to back at my Konami days when we were working on a poker game,
3307000	3311000	like seven years after the poker fad had ended.
3311000	3313000	And everybody thought it was a bad idea.
3313000	3315000	They pumped all this money into it.
3315000	3316000	They put out trailers.
3316000	3318000	It was coming out for Xbox Live.
3318000	3323000	And they finally realized it was not like just cut your losses and run.
3323000	3324000	Don't put it out.
3324000	3328000	Somebody needed to tell Square Enix to do it to this game.
3328000	3332000	Do you think Blizzard needs to be told that about Diablo Immortal?
3332000	3333000	I don't care.
3333000	3336000	Like, I love the Switch one.
3336000	3338000	I'm having a blast with it.
3338000	3340000	They can do whatever they want on mobile.
3340000	3342000	I'm not going to touch it, probably.
3342000	3344000	That's interesting how you can have that perspective,
3344000	3346000	where like mobile doesn't affect you.
3346000	3349000	And like a game that you don't want to play doesn't affect you,
3349000	3350000	and that's okay.
3350000	3351000	Isn't that fascinating?
3351000	3355000	If it was some integration to a game I like, Final Fantasy XIV,
3355000	3359000	that was terribly done, Final Fantasy XIV, then yeah, I might be upset.
3359000	3363000	But this is a standalone game that has nothing to do with screwing up,
3363000	3366000	you know, something I like, Final Fantasy XIV.
3369000	3370000	Other comments in chat.
3370000	3373000	MXC wants to ask to both you and Loki,
3373000	3376000	do you guys have anything to say about the fact that the protagonist is
3376000	3379000	maybe in love with a woman who looks exactly like his dead mom?
3379000	3380000	Yeah.
3382000	3384000	This game has so many issues.
3384000	3386000	I thought it was her at first.
3386000	3389000	I was like, why is my best friend who turns out to be the villain,
3389000	3394000	like in all these pictures with my mom that got shot,
3394000	3396000	and he's looking like he does now.
3396000	3399000	And then later on, you know, because there's no subtitles,
3399000	3402000	and nothing that I can hear to tell me what's really going on.
3402000	3405000	Then I put it together that she just looks like her,
3405000	3407000	and it's not maybe actually her.
3407000	3408000	I don't know.
3408000	3409000	The game is dumb.
3409000	3411000	We don't know because you can't tell what's going on.
3411000	3412000	But yeah, seriously.
3412000	3413000	It's the actors in a different way.
3413000	3414000	If you're somewhat interested,
3414000	3416000	just to kind of know what we're talking about here,
3416000	3419000	and the only reason I know any of this is because I watched the video
3419000	3420000	that Jim Sterling did.
3420000	3423000	He did a 20-minute video talking about this game and showing off the poor.
3423000	3425000	There's no animation transitions, for one,
3425000	3427000	which is another nice thing, too.
3427000	3429000	So when you're punching someone, they're falling over.
3429000	3431000	They just pop back up, and then they get punched again,
3431000	3432000	and they fall back down.
3432000	3433000	They pop back up again.
3433000	3434000	We need to punch them.
3434000	3437000	The only way I know, I went and watched it on Twitch
3437000	3439000	the minute Shane told me about how bad this game was.
3439000	3442000	I went, and there was people playing it for extra life.
3442000	3444000	I guess they were punishing themselves for donations
3444000	3446000	by playing this game on their Twitch streams.
3446000	3448000	One of my favorite things about the game
3448000	3451000	is that your walking animation doesn't look terrible,
3451000	3453000	because parts of this game look okay.
3453000	3456000	It looks like an up-resed PS3 game, maybe.
3456000	3459000	It seriously sounds like a CD-ROM game out of 1994.
3459000	3460000	It really does.
3460000	3463000	But it plays like, I don't know, a Coleco game or something.
3463000	3468000	But you walk into a wall or an object,
3468000	3472000	and your character gets stopped in the motion that he was in
3472000	3473000	as he was walking into that object.
3473000	3475000	It's not like he just stands still.
3475000	3478000	He's literally stuck in that pose until you move.
3478000	3483000	I just don't know what this game is
3483000	3487000	besides a waste of maybe $15.
3487000	3489000	Well, Shane, I appreciate you coming on the show
3489000	3491000	to spoil the game to make sure nobody will ever play it.
3491000	3492000	That was very kind of you.
3492000	3493000	Nobody should play it.
3493000	3494000	Don't waste your money.
3494000	3497000	If you want to give somebody a bad present, that's it.
3497000	3500000	But do you really want to risk your friendship?
3501000	3503000	Since you brought up Konami in your years there,
3503000	3508000	which game was worse, A Quiet Man or The Winx?
3508000	3510000	Oh, A Quiet Man. The Winx was awesome.
3510000	3511000	What are you talking about?
3511000	3514000	I enjoyed my time with that game.
3514000	3518000	There is nothing enjoyable about this game whatsoever.
3518000	3519000	We can talk about all that now, right?
3519000	3522000	That you were a tester on The Winx and all that stuff?
3522000	3525000	Yeah, when I was in between DVRs and stuff, yeah.
3525000	3527000	I was on The Winx, and it was fun.
3527000	3530000	It was such a better game than this.
3530000	3534000	There are so many games I used to think I hated,
3534000	3537000	and now I would welcome them with open arms.
3537000	3540000	I remember I went to Blockbuster and rented Morrowind,
3540000	3542000	and I thought it was so bad I took it back
3542000	3546000	and rented Unlimited Saga, and that was bad too.
3546000	3548000	I thought that was the worst it could possibly get.
3548000	3553000	And then I played The Quiet Man, and it's just...
3554000	3561000	I wish this wasn't one of the first notable death protagonists,
3561000	3564000	if maybe the first notable one,
3564000	3569000	because it's just a bad thing to be attached to, I feel like.
3569000	3570000	Shane, let's quickly...
3570000	3573000	I got to get back to the show because we do have news to get to,
3573000	3577000	but I thought since you did spend 15-plus minutes talking about a bad game,
3577000	3581000	I would maybe give you 60 seconds to talk about Tetris Effect, a good game?
3581000	3584000	Oh, it's so good.
3584000	3586000	I've played the demo so many times.
3586000	3589000	I meant to play just the first three stages the night it released,
3589000	3592000	and I played it for like an hour and a half instead,
3592000	3595000	and it was still just the same first three stages.
3595000	3599000	You know what was weird, though, is I'm not 100% sold on the VR mode.
3599000	3602000	I played it, and it didn't really grab me as much as I thought it would.
3602000	3603000	Interesting.
3603000	3605000	So now we're two for three on VR,
3605000	3607000	because Loki and Bobby preferred the VR.
3607000	3609000	You don't.
3609000	3610000	No.
3610000	3613000	Maybe if I had a headset on, too, that might have helped,
3613000	3617000	but I was just using a soundbar and my VR headset,
3617000	3621000	and I definitely preferred playing it regular to that.
3621000	3624000	Interesting, because the common theme I kind of heard with Loki and Bobby
3624000	3627000	was that it was the immersion and the fact that it kind of took you out
3627000	3628000	of the rest of your room.
3628000	3630000	That was the big thing for it.
3630000	3631000	So maybe...
3631000	3633000	Oh, maybe I was just too focused on the game
3633000	3636000	that it didn't really change my perspective.
3636000	3638000	Bobby does say, I had headphones on with a headset.
3638000	3639000	What about you, Loki?
3639000	3640000	I had headphones.
3640000	3641000	Maybe that's the trick.
3641000	3642000	That's probably it.
3642000	3644000	That's what I'll need to do when it comes out for real.
3644000	3647000	But hey, if you get it at Best Buy, you have to wait an extra week,
3647000	3648000	so it kind of sucks.
3648000	3649000	Uh-oh.
3649000	3650000	All right.
3650000	3653000	Well, Shane, I guess we're going to have to invite you back on OLR
3653000	3655000	in a couple weeks, because you and I are headed
3655000	3657000	to Final Fantasy Fan Fest in a couple weeks.
3657000	3661000	Yeah, and maybe I will buckle down and beat the quiet man
3661000	3663000	so you guys can all know exactly what I feel about it,
3663000	3665000	because I haven't figured it out yet.
3665000	3666000	All right.
3666000	3668000	Well, maybe you should wait a week for it to get this patch,
3668000	3669000	apparently, that it's getting.
3669000	3670000	No!
3670000	3673000	I have to play it in the original artistic intent.
3673000	3674000	That's right.
3674000	3676000	It's not called the loud man.
3676000	3677000	It's called the quiet man.
3677000	3678000	It's not even necessarily a patch.
3678000	3680000	Like, they thought about it in the second hand.
3680000	3681000	That's how the game ends.
3681000	3683000	They're all like, you know, there's more secrets to be unlocked
3683000	3685000	and it has a countdown to the patch.
3685000	3688000	Wow.
3688000	3689000	All right.
3689000	3690000	Oh, this is so bad.
3690000	3691000	All right, Shane.
3691000	3694000	I hope the secret it unlocks is a way to get your money back.
3694000	3695000	All right, Shane.
3695000	3697000	Well, the chatters really enjoyed hearing from you.
3697000	3699000	SJ100Matt says Shane needs to come back more often.
3699000	3700000	So don't be a stranger.
3700000	3702000	We'll hear from you again soon, I hope.
3702000	3703000	All right.
3703000	3704000	Bye.
3704000	3705000	Bye.
3705000	3706000	All right.
3706000	3707000	Thanks, Shane.
3707000	3708000	And I'm going to bug him.
3708000	3709000	Did you hear what he said about that Pokestop podcast thing?
3709000	3710000	Yeah.
3710000	3711000	I'm going to bug him about that.
3711000	3712000	All right.
3712000	3713000	One thing.
3713000	3714000	Oh, I didn't get into this with Shane.
3714000	3715000	I had it up in the background because this was important too.
3715000	3719000	Apparently, one of the big things about the quiet man
3719000	3721000	is that a new song was written for it.
3721000	3723000	So it actually has like an original song.
3723000	3725000	Hey, why would you waste the potential of that on this?
3725000	3726000	Such a terrible game.
3726000	3727000	Get this.
3727000	3729000	Do you know who that is doing the song?
3729000	3731000	It's Imogen Heap.
3731000	3732000	One of my favorite.
3732000	3734000	Now, I know not everybody probably knows who Imogen Heap is,
3734000	3737000	but she's like legit one of my favorite musicians like ever.
3737000	3738000	She did a great.
3738000	3739000	She did them.
3739000	3741000	Everybody knows that song, hide and seek,
3741000	3743000	because that's where the dear sister.
3743000	3744000	All that came from.
3744000	3745000	What you say.
3745000	3746000	That was Imogen Heap, right?
3746000	3748000	And all that dear sister on Star Live and all those parodies.
3748000	3749000	That was Imogen Heap.
3750000	3752000	A lot of people know her band, Fru Fru,
3752000	3756000	with Guy that did the Must Be Dreamin'.
3756000	3757000	The one that was in the movie Garden State.
3757000	3760000	So I think a lot of people probably have heard of Imogen Heap.
3760000	3762000	But anyway, she did this song for the quiet.
3762000	3765000	And apparently, it's a waste of talent.
3765000	3766000	That's really unfortunate.
3766000	3769000	I think that plays like at the ending credits or something like that.
3769000	3772000	So it's kind of like the Leona Lewis song of Final Fantasy 13.
3772000	3774000	You don't hear it until the closing credits basically.
3774000	3775000	Interesting.
3775000	3776000	All right.
3776000	3777000	Spoiler alert.
3777000	3779000	But yeah, go watch the Jim Sterling video
3779000	3781000	if you want to see what this game is all about.
3781000	3784000	And honestly, after watching it, no.
3784000	3787000	I didn't know what this game was, and I don't care.
3787000	3789000	I know we're going to get an email that's really pissed off
3789000	3790000	about the spoilers that Shane dropped.
3790000	3792000	But honestly, he did you a favor.
3792000	3793000	It's a two hour long game.
3793000	3794000	$15.
3794000	3795000	All right.
3795000	3797000	And most of it's cut scenes.
3797000	3800000	Let's get into some news.
3800000	3801000	I don't really have a lot of announcements
3801000	3804000	except for the fact that we will not be here in two weeks
3804000	3806000	because of the Final Fantasy Fan Fest I just mentioned.
3807000	3809000	Shane and myself and some of our other friends
3809000	3811000	will be in Las Vegas.
3811000	3814000	Actually, that Sunday we will be driving back from Las Vegas,
3814000	3816000	but that is a nine hour drive.
3816000	3818000	I don't expect to be back in time for OLR, sadly.
3818000	3819000	So we're just going to not have it that night.
3819000	3820000	All right.
3820000	3821000	All right.
3821000	3823000	So one thing we didn't mention during the whole BlizzCon thing
3823000	3826000	is that Destiny 2 is now free
3826000	3829000	if you have a Blizzard Battle.net account.
3829000	3831000	So you can actually go in there on your profile
3831000	3832000	and they have like gifts,
3832000	3835000	and you can redeem the base game for free
3835000	3837000	up until the 18th of November.
3837000	3838000	Again, talk about it.
3838000	3840000	I know I went off on this earlier,
3840000	3842000	but talk about a missed messaging opportunity.
3842000	3845000	I can't believe they buried that in the pregame show
3845000	3847000	and they didn't announce that.
3847000	3848000	Why didn't they announce that on stage?
3848000	3849000	Now, to be fair,
3849000	3853000	maybe the problem is that Destiny is not a Blizzard game.
3853000	3857000	And so if the guy from Destiny had come up at BlizzCon,
3857000	3859000	that might have had a really weird reception
3859000	3860000	from the Blizzard fans
3860000	3862000	because I know not all of them are really into Destiny 2.
3862000	3864000	They know that the company is called Activision Blizzard, right?
3864000	3865000	I know, I know.
3865000	3866000	Just saying.
3866000	3867000	But to be fair,
3867000	3869000	like if the dude came out,
3869000	3870000	we'd probably be all like,
3870000	3871000	who the hell are you? Get off the stage.
3871000	3872000	But if he's out to say,
3872000	3875000	hi, I'm giving away my game for free,
3875000	3876000	I think everybody would be like,
3876000	3877000	oh, okay, cheers and applause.
3877000	3878000	Cheers for the free game.
3878000	3879000	Cheers and applause.
3879000	3880000	Like, you know,
3880000	3882000	they're not going to boo him off the stage for that.
3882000	3885000	So I do kind of think that was a really,
3885000	3889000	again, poor missed messaging opportunity on Blizzard's part,
3889000	3893000	which is going to be a bit of a theme of BlizzCon 2018, I think.
3893000	3897000	But if you have, I mean, hey, free game in Destiny 2.
3897000	3898000	Exactly, I'm not sure.
3898000	3900000	It was also free on PlayStation 4,
3900000	3902000	like was it August, I think?
3902000	3903000	It was like a plus title.
3903000	3905000	Yeah, it was in August or September or something like that.
3905000	3908000	Because, spoiler alert, the expansions aren't free,
3908000	3910000	and that's what they really want you to buy.
3910000	3911000	But...
3911000	3912000	Joke's on them.
3912000	3914000	I'm not going to buy them.
3914000	3916000	You can still get a pretty decent experience
3916000	3919000	with the free game, and you know, why not?
3919000	3920000	If you have a Battle.net account,
3920000	3921000	which I imagine most of you do,
3921000	3924000	and you don't have to buy a Blizzard game to get one,
3924000	3927000	because like you can play the WoW trial,
3927000	3928000	the World of Warcraft trial.
3928000	3930000	Well, and Hearthstone is free, actually,
3930000	3931000	now that I think about it.
3931000	3933000	So you could just download it to play Hearthstone,
3933000	3935000	and you're set.
3935000	3937000	You can grab your free copy of Destiny 2,
3937000	3939000	but only until November.
3939000	3940000	The 18th.
3940000	3942000	So again, about two weeks from tonight.
3942000	3944000	So go get it.
3944000	3945000	Go do that.
3945000	3946000	Even if you're not sure if you want to play it,
3946000	3948000	it's always good just to put it in your library.
3948000	3949000	That's right.
3949000	3952000	It's not free until November 18th
3952000	3954000	when they're going to pull it off your account,
3954000	3955000	but register it now.
3955000	3957000	It's free forever, basically,
3957000	3960000	because the real trick is they want you to buy the expansions.
3960000	3961000	That's why they're doing this.
3961000	3963000	Don't kid yourself.
3963000	3966000	Yeah, DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3966000	3968000	once you get Destiny 2, please pick up Forsaken 2.
3968000	3970000	Yeah, exactly.
3970000	3973000	vidpower points out you do need Blizzard SMS
3973000	3975000	on your Battle.net account to get your free Destiny 2 game,
3975000	3978000	so they do want you to have the two-factor authentication,
3978000	3980000	which, I mean, say what you will about that
3980000	3982000	and maybe giving Blizzard your phone number,
3982000	3984000	but in this day and age, you guys,
3984000	3985000	I don't know about you,
3985000	3986000	I have two-factor authentication
3986000	3988000	on everything that will let me.
3988000	3989000	Everything that will let me.
3989000	3991000	It's just that kind of world that we live in
3991000	3993000	when who's going to get hacked next?
3993000	3996000	And especially after having my Xbox 360 account
3996000	3997000	hacked some time ago,
3997000	3999000	I don't know, it was probably like 10 years ago at this point,
3999000	4001000	but still, I don't want that shit to happen again.
4001000	4003000	So you better believe I have two-factor authentication
4003000	4005000	on everything.
4005000	4007000	And I think it's a good idea.
4008000	4010000	And then even for my email,
4010000	4015000	I will put the two-factor authentication on myself and Alan.
4015000	4017000	So even if I ever get locked out or I lose my phone,
4017000	4019000	at least Alan can unlock the most important thing,
4019000	4020000	that type of thing.
4020000	4022000	So anyway, let's see.
4022000	4024000	Go into chat at live.vognetwork.com.
4024000	4025000	Bonds006 says,
4025000	4027000	Not ever going to buy any expansion.
4027000	4030000	Well, only the Warcraft 3 expansion, Frozen Throne.
4030000	4031000	How do you feel, though,
4031000	4034000	when the expansions are finally bundled in with the main game?
4034000	4036000	Because, for example, if you get Diablo 3 on Switch,
4037000	4039000	people forget there was an expansion
4039000	4041000	that really made that game a lot better.
4041000	4043000	I don't even remember the name of it now.
4043000	4045000	It's just Diablo 3 as I know it.
4045000	4047000	I know they had Rise of the Necromancer,
4047000	4049000	was what they called when they released the Necromancer,
4049000	4051000	although it really wasn't an expansion.
4051000	4053000	But, yeah, they released all that,
4053000	4055000	and now you just get it all in one.
4055000	4057000	So it's not really an expansion,
4057000	4059000	because it's the Ultimate Edition or whatever they call it.
4059000	4061000	Let's see.
4063000	4065000	It's just Reaper of Souls. Thank you, Vidpower.
4065000	4066000	Bobby Blackwolf is saying,
4066000	4068000	The Quiet Man is on Steam, which means you can refund it
4068000	4071000	as long as you don't play it for longer than two hours.
4071000	4072000	Which is how long the game is.
4072000	4073000	And Shane says,
4073000	4075000	Why would you put yourself through even five minutes?
4075000	4078000	Did I make clear how terrible it was?
4078000	4080000	If you want to put yourself through 20 minutes,
4080000	4084000	like I say, I recommend you go watch Jim Sterling's video on it,
4084000	4088000	because it sums up basically all of the key features
4088000	4090000	of why you would not like this game.
4090000	4092000	I love that Shane is continuing his campaign of hate
4092000	4094000	by joining the chat room to be like,
4094000	4096000	He is just doing a public service
4096000	4099000	of keeping people away from shitty games.
4099000	4101000	There is no harm in that.
4101000	4104000	And I understand that Square Enix is a company
4104000	4106000	that I like as well, but you know what?
4106000	4110000	When they make a crappy game that's not Chocobo Racing,
4110000	4112000	then I'm going to call them out on that crap.
4112000	4114000	I love Chocobo Racing.
4114000	4116000	Exactly. They could have used the resources
4116000	4117000	put towards this.
4117000	4119000	We could have had a whole new Imogen Heat song
4119000	4121000	for Chocobo Racing.
4122000	4125000	Crazy Chocobo by Imogen Heat.
4125000	4128000	But no, instead we get the Quiet Man.
4128000	4131000	It's a crime, I tell you.
4133000	4135000	I'm just imagining Imogen Heat singing a bunch of lyrics
4135000	4139000	that go like, Work, work, work, quack, work, work, quack.
4139000	4141000	And it sadly makes sense.
4141000	4145000	So them doing the whole, you know,
4147000	4149000	just like the Chocobo theme,
4149000	4151000	but with that auto-tune.
4151000	4153000	Yes. That. Exactly that.
4153000	4156000	There was another big announcement this week
4156000	4158000	around Super Smash Bros.
4158000	4160000	That's right, there was a big direct,
4160000	4162000	Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Direct
4162000	4164000	that happened earlier this week,
4164000	4166000	and lots of things were unveiled.
4166000	4168000	And the earlier rumors,
4168000	4170000	remember that really convincing rumor,
4170000	4172000	the Grinch rumor in that whole thing?
4172000	4174000	No, that was not convincing. It's from 4chan.
4174000	4176000	Turned out to be fake.
4176000	4178000	Oh, what a fake rumor from 4chan?
4178000	4180000	That is so unreal.
4182000	4184000	Anyway, the one part that was real
4184000	4186000	was like the even odds bet part
4186000	4188000	that Ken is going to be...
4188000	4190000	Oh, there's already a leaked screenshot of Ken.
4190000	4192000	Everybody knew Ken was coming, come on.
4192000	4194000	They will be continuing to release new amiibo
4194000	4196000	throughout 2019.
4196000	4198000	So with all these new characters
4198000	4200000	that are coming to the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,
4200000	4202000	there will be new amiibo,
4202000	4204000	including Isabel, Pichu, Ken,
4204000	4206000	Young Link, Daisy,
4206000	4209000	all of the new amiibo coming in through 2019.
4209000	4212000	Apparently there will be a snake amiibo at some point.
4212000	4214000	King K. Rool and Ice Climbers
4214000	4217000	are going to be out on February 15th, 2019.
4217000	4219000	Wolf and Ridley and Inkling
4219000	4221000	will be the launch day amiibos.
4221000	4224000	The question is, are they still patching it?
4224000	4226000	Well, I don't think they are in the Wii U anymore.
4226000	4228000	Are they patching in those new amiibos
4228000	4230000	to work with Mario Maker?
4230000	4232000	I think Mario Maker is kind of done, Loki.
4232000	4234000	I hate to say it.
4234000	4236000	I kind of wish they would bring it back.
4236000	4238000	I'm surprised they have a remaster of that.
4238000	4240000	I wish they would bring it back for Switch,
4240000	4242000	but maybe that will be a thing they do next year.
4242000	4244000	Anyway, no trophies.
4244000	4246000	That whole trophy thing is going to be gone
4246000	4248000	in Super Smash Ultimate.
4248000	4250000	What they are doing instead,
4250000	4252000	it is a spirit system.
4252000	4254000	Not everybody I think is feeling this,
4254000	4256000	but that's what it is.
4256000	4258000	You will be able to fill your player with spirits,
4258000	4260000	like an augment.
4260000	4262000	You can do primary and support spirits,
4262000	4264000	but you will not have the characters.
4264000	4266000	You will win them in spirit battles.
4266000	4268000	I guess the aura of characters
4268000	4270000	that were not included in the game,
4270000	4272000	like Astro Man from Mega Man 9
4272000	4274000	and Chibi-Robo,
4274000	4276000	you can also do these with multiplayer mode.
4276000	4278000	For example, if you fight a giant Mega Man
4278000	4280000	in the Guts Man stage,
4280000	4282000	you might get the Guts Man spirit.
4282000	4284000	That's something you can use to augment your character
4284000	4286000	a little later on.
4286000	4288000	Because they've killed everyone.
4288000	4290000	Apparently, you can feed and upgrade.
4290000	4292000	You level up, you do missions.
4292000	4294000	One way I've heard this referred to negatively
4294000	4296000	is it's kind of like a mobile phone.
4296000	4298000	What do they call it?
4298000	4300000	Gotcha type of game.
4300000	4302000	Even though that might be a big deal in Japan,
4302000	4304000	they're not nearly quite as popular here.
4304000	4306000	I don't think everybody is really excited about that.
4308000	4310000	Anyway, vidpower in chat says,
4310000	4312000	poor Sakurai, he'll be working on Smash stuff forever.
4312000	4314000	One of my favorite memes right now
4314000	4316000	is that picture of Sakurai
4316000	4318000	just looking dead-ass tired that says,
4318000	4320000	he's never asked me for anything ever again.
4320000	4326000	Also, they announced that Piranha Plant
4326000	4328000	will be the first DLC fighter.
4328000	4330000	So Piranha Plant will be coming to the game.
4330000	4333000	That is, I think, a free DLC character, actually.
4333000	4335000	If you buy the game before January something.
4335000	4337000	Oh, that's right. You have to buy it before a certain day.
4337000	4340000	So it's kind of like a launch window type of free thing
4340000	4342000	that you can grab there.
4342000	4344000	You can also get a Piranha Plant amiibo
4344000	4346000	with all those other things I was talking about.
4346000	4348000	People are very excited about this.
4348000	4350000	The final Smash will be Petey Piranha.
4350000	4352000	So that's from Mario Galaxy,
4352000	4354000	is where that reference comes from.
4354000	4356000	So yay that they're still referencing that, I suppose.
4356000	4359000	And then, didn't they announce one more fighter too?
4359000	4361000	Oh yes, Incineroar was also announced
4361000	4363000	as a playable fighter in the game.
4363000	4365000	Which, you know, another Pokemon fighter.
4365000	4368000	But it's kind of like a wrestling Pokemon.
4368000	4370000	Incineroar really looks like a wrestler.
4370000	4372000	So I guess there's a lot they can kind of do with that.
4372000	4374000	So they can make it, you know.
4374000	4377000	Is Incineroar in the Pokemon fighting game?
4377000	4379000	No, I don't believe so.
4379000	4381000	Because Incineroar, if I remember right,
4381000	4383000	comes from Pokemon, the newest one.
4383000	4385000	Pokemon Sun and Moon.
4385000	4387000	Because he is Litten's final form.
4387000	4389000	So he comes from the newest one.
4389000	4394000	I think Pokken is before Gen 7.
4394000	4396000	I think. Don't quote me.
4396000	4399000	I'm sure I'll get corrected in chat momentarily if I'm wrong.
4399000	4401000	Shane in chat says,
4401000	4405000	Piranha Plant is not a part of the five upcoming DLC fighters.
4405000	4407000	Which is good.
4407000	4409000	Oh, but Shane does point out.
4409000	4411000	DeSuidae is in Pokken.
4411000	4413000	And that is Gen 7. So I was wrong on that.
4413000	4415000	DeSuidae is Rowlet's final form.
4415000	4417000	So I forgot about that. So fair enough.
4417000	4419000	Let's see.
4419000	4421000	There's going to be a fighter's pass
4421000	4423000	to support all these DLC characters.
4423000	4425000	It comes not just with a DLC character, but there will be a stage
4425000	4427000	and all that good stuff.
4427000	4430000	Yeah, so there will be a World of Light adventure mode.
4430000	4432000	Subspace Emissary is not coming back.
4432000	4434000	But the World of Light adventure mode kind of looks fun.
4434000	4436000	Although obviously they're keeping a lot of it a secret.
4436000	4438000	Because they don't want people to ruin it all.
4438000	4440000	Apparently Kirby is going to play a big role in that.
4440000	4442000	Which I'm sure made Act Deft very happy to hear.
4442000	4445000	So, lots of news coming out about Smash.
4445000	4448000	What do you think? Where's your head at with Smash?
4448000	4450000	I mean, the reality is,
4450000	4453000	the minute they announced they were doing a Smash Bros. for Switch,
4453000	4455000	I'm getting it. Why wouldn't I get it?
4455000	4458000	Like, it kind of doesn't matter what's announced and all this stuff.
4458000	4461000	I don't want to make it sound like I'm not hyped or anything like that.
4461000	4465000	But I just, you know, I just think
4465000	4467000	the game is going to be great. It's a Smash game.
4467000	4470000	What are the chances you think Waluigi is going to be a DLC character?
4472000	4474000	Never say never.
4474000	4476000	But I just, I don't know.
4476000	4479000	It would be funny if it was the very last one they do.
4479000	4481000	But I don't know, guys.
4481000	4485000	I think the internet, sometimes the internet shouldn't get everything at once.
4485000	4487000	Let's just leave it at that.
4489000	4492000	Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.
4492000	4494000	Kaijuto says,
4494000	4496000	They better not make another Smash after this one.
4496000	4499000	This is the ultimate. Just put it on every system here on out.
4499000	4500000	S2100Matt says,
4500000	4503000	Sakurai is going to hide deep in the woods after this one.
4503000	4505000	You know what? Honestly, after this,
4505000	4508000	Sakurai should be able to make whatever fucking game he wants.
4508000	4511000	If he has like a pet project that, you know what?
4511000	4513000	He should be able to make whatever fucking game he wants
4513000	4515000	after doing this for Nintendo for so long.
4515000	4517000	And as far as Smash Bros. goes,
4517000	4519000	you can wait a little while for another one.
4519000	4521000	Or maybe it'll just get turned over to other people.
4521000	4524000	Not that I'm saying Sakurai really shouldn't stay a part of it,
4524000	4526000	but if Sakurai wants to do some other stuff,
4526000	4528000	fucking let him. Jesus.
4528000	4531000	First off, let him take a nap.
4531000	4533000	That's the first thing he should do,
4533000	4535000	is get to take a nap.
4535000	4537000	Anyway, let's move on.
4537000	4539000	We have plenty more news to get to. Loki.
4539000	4543000	So there was a new Undertale type game that was released.
4543000	4546000	So, Deltarune, which was a prequel to Undertale.
4547000	4550000	And, or, I don't know if it was a prequel, a sequel,
4550000	4552000	but it's related to Undertale.
4552000	4557000	And I guess they had this survey that went out, as well,
4557000	4560000	that allowed you to actually download the game for free,
4560000	4562000	if I remember correctly.
4562000	4564000	So it's pretty cool.
4564000	4566000	And then, I don't know.
4566000	4571000	It's a neat looking game, but...
4573000	4575000	I still haven't played Undertale yet.
4575000	4577000	But, I hear this one's pretty cool,
4577000	4581000	and it has a lot of people wondering, you know,
4581000	4583000	what the secrets are behind it.
4583000	4585000	So mysterious.
4585000	4586000	Is this one of those things where, like,
4586000	4587000	it's gonna be like an onion,
4587000	4589000	where many layers start unveiling themselves,
4589000	4592000	and how it ties into other stuff, and, I don't know,
4592000	4594000	like a whole, like, Five Nights type story going on here?
4594000	4596000	Sort of, but, like, they have, what's kind of cool about it is,
4596000	4600000	like, they have a similar combat system in the game,
4600000	4602000	but you can actually have parties,
4602000	4604000	instead of just, like, your single character.
4605000	4607000	I don't know.
4607000	4610000	It looked pretty cool from the video that I saw, but...
4610000	4613000	Some comments from chat, over at live.vognetwork.com.
4613000	4614000	Rama says,
4614000	4617000	Deltarune is an anagram for Undertale.
4617000	4619000	So, interesting. Fun fact.
4619000	4622000	And then, Dark Tetsuya, I'm sorry,
4622000	4625000	it's actually s200mata saying, Loki, play Undertale.
4625000	4627000	And stream it, also.
4627000	4628000	I have, I have it.
4628000	4630000	I just haven't played it yet.
4630000	4631000	But I have it.
4631000	4632000	Story of my life.
4632000	4634000	It's in my Steam collection.
4634000	4636000	Exactly. It's in my Steam library.
4636000	4638000	Just haven't gotten around to playing it yet.
4638000	4645000	Alright, well, something that's possibly going to be added to your Switch library soon is the YouTube app.
4645000	4649000	Lots of rumors that the YouTube app is finally going to happen on Nintendo Switch,
4649000	4651000	so that could be interesting.
4651000	4656000	This is due to the fact that the official Nintendo site put up a placeholder for YouTube on the Nintendo Switch.
4656000	4660000	So, apparently, it will be coming to the system on the 8th of November.
4660000	4663000	Now, there hasn't been any confirmation from Nintendo or YouTube on this,
4663000	4665000	but, I mean, why not, right?
4665000	4666000	So, that would be this week.
4666000	4667000	Yeah.
4667000	4668000	Getting right into the holiday season.
4668000	4669000	Putting Netflix on it while they're at it.
4669000	4670000	I know, right?
4670000	4672000	But, for whatever reason, that isn't on the agenda yet.
4672000	4676000	But, YouTube, you know, like, you would use that, right?
4676000	4678000	Because your kids love YouTube, don't they?
4678000	4683000	Yeah, probably not necessarily on the, um, on the Switch,
4683000	4687000	but, yeah, I mean, I would, I would see some use out of it.
4687000	4688000	Alright.
4688000	4689000	Well, let's move on.
4689000	4692000	Just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.
4692000	4697000	One other game that I should be excited about, but I, unfortunately, am not excited about.
4697000	4699000	That's Fallout 76.
4699000	4704000	So, Fallout 76, if you had pre-ordered it, you get the wonderful beta tests that you get to participate in.
4704000	4708000	So, with that, um, there's been some hitches with the beta, after all.
4708000	4715000	So, one of the first problems is there's a bug in the beta that actually re-downloads the beta.
4715000	4718000	So, as you're, you know, trying to launch the game or whatever,
4718000	4723000	um, it unfortunately causes the client to delete itself and re-download itself.
4723000	4725000	All 50 gigs of it.
4725000	4730000	Sounds like, um, an issue you might have had, you know, but not necessarily with this game, but, like, similar to...
4730000	4736000	When Quantum Break's patching thing on the Xbox One caused me to hit my Comcast data cap for the first time.
4736000	4742000	But, yeah, the minute you said that, like, re-downloading 50 gigs, like, if that happens 20 times, you're at your cap.
4742000	4749000	I mean, honestly, since you've already, you've probably used three or four hundred, you know, megabytes in a month like I do, you got less than that.
4749000	4754000	Yeah, so, like, apparently there was an issue where, like, it would freeze up and then it would just force you to re-download the whole thing.
4754000	4756000	So, that kind of sucks.
4756000	4762000	Um, but apparently, um, I guess they're working on maybe fixing it. I don't know.
4762000	4768000	Um, and then on top of that, a little bit more major bug, though, in actual gameplay and how the game is designed.
4769000	4776000	Apparently, people have found that the physics in the game are tied to the framerate that you're running the game at.
4776000	4784000	So, for example, if you have a better system or you're, you know, find a way that you can run the game at a higher framerate,
4784000	4793000	and you can actually unlock the framerate using a small edit to an .ini file, um, if you're able to run the game at a higher framerate,
4793000	4799000	you will move faster than other players, or you will shoot faster than other players.
4799000	4806000	So, for example, people have been looking at the ground a little bit to help, you know, cause the framerate to go up,
4806000	4810000	and they're able to run faster than people, um, that are on lower spec computers.
4810000	4811000	Hmm.
4811000	4814000	That is stupid. You should never do that.
4814000	4815000	Yeah, that sounds like a problem.
4815000	4818000	That is, like, amateur hour bullshit.
4819000	4825000	DungeonBuster in chat says, well, Bethesda did say to prepare for spectacular bugs with Fallout 76.
4825000	4826000	It is a beta, right?
4826000	4829000	You can't advertise that as a feature, Bethesda.
4830000	4832000	Bugs are not a feature.
4833000	4837000	I mean, some of them can be, like, quaint in, like, Skyrim stuff.
4838000	4841000	Seriously, that is, that is some broken shit right there.
4841000	4844000	Like, I don't know what modern game nowadays would even do that.
4844000	4851000	Like, you always check the, you know, like, for example, in Unity, you would use a delta time,
4851000	4859000	so that you were always getting a consistent, um, clock tick on your, you know, physics calculations or whatever,
4859000	4863000	because you're able to see, oh, this frame came sooner than this last frame.
4863000	4872000	It's always kind of, you know, giving you a multiplier to speed and slow down everything based on whatever delay there is in your framerate.
4873000	4876000	But to just lock it to that framerate is dumb.
4876000	4881000	That's why, like, in some of these older games, like, that are, I can't think of anything in particular,
4881000	4886000	but there's, like, some older games, like, if you try to emulate them or you try to run them on a faster PC,
4886000	4890000	it just fucks everything up, because, like, a game that was locked through a 30 FPS,
4890000	4896000	well, the physics are all based on the 30 FPS, and so when you unlock at the 60, everything goes all fucked up.
4896000	4903000	And apparently this, from what I hear, was an issue tied to Gamebryo, which was, like, one of their engines that they were running back with Morrowind,
4903000	4910000	but they incorporated some of that stuff into the creation engine when they were doing, you know, Skyrim and Fallout and all that stuff,
4910000	4916000	and they just, I guess they kept dealing, I don't know why they would do that. It's just really dumb.
4916000	4919000	Is it something that seems like it'll be fixable before the main game releases, though?
4919000	4920000	I don't think they can fix it.
4920000	4922000	Oh, God. Interesting.
4922000	4923000	Interesting.
4923000	4926000	I mean, it would be a major overhaul, I think.
4926000	4930000	So, consoles are going to be the way to do it, because consoles, at least, are all kind of, like, the same baseline.
4930000	4939000	They're going to be locked to, they would be able to lock the framerate, but PC, since you have that stuff exposed in an INI file, it's dumb.
4939000	4941000	Oh, boy.
4941000	4946000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, hey, let's attack this guy's camp. Other guy moves as fast as the flash and kills everyone.
4946000	4948000	Oh, never mind.
4948000	4950000	That sounds a little game-breaking.
4950000	4958000	Like, it wouldn't be so bad if it was, like, a single-player game, but being that it's online multiplayer, eh, not great.
4958000	4961000	Well, if you want to play a single-player game that's only-
4961000	4969000	Oh, and I did want to mention, just in case there was any question, Bethesda says there were the issue, and it says a fix won't be out until the game launches.
4969000	4972000	So, they're going to try to work it out before the game launches, I guess.
4972000	4973000	Yes.
4973000	4974000	Interesting.
4974000	4978000	All right, well, if you do want to play a single-player only game, then one of those games you can play is Tetris Effect.
4978000	4988000	That's right, because Tetris Effect will not have competitive multiplayer, which is something that many people, I think, associate with Tetris, especially thanks to things like Tetranet or the original Game Boy Tetris.
4988000	4993000	Yeah, but this is a little bit more chill, so I can kind of see how it would-
4993000	4996000	I think that's exactly why they did this.
4996000	5006000	You know, Mizuguchi talks about how Tetris Effect is really kind of to get in the zone, which is why you have that zone mechanic, and it's really, you know, what they're doing is really all about that.
5006000	5011000	And a representative from Enhanced Games kind of, you know, expanded on this, named Mark McDonald, saying,
5011000	5015000	There's no direct head-to-head multiplayer because we don't want something that's going to stress people out.
5015000	5019000	People would find a way to spell fuck you in Tetris pieces or something.
5019000	5022000	Well, he's not wrong.
5022000	5024000	I think it'd be easier for them to draw a dick.
5024000	5026000	Yeah, that's true. Anyway.
5026000	5030000	We just want to make it into a positive thing where you see your friends playing well.
5030000	5044000	And so I guess they do like, you know, there's Learboards, asynchronous multiplayer, the whole, you know, they did that weekend ritual during the test this weekend where everybody was working towards a common goal, which they hit before I could even log into the game.
5044000	5045000	I mean, they hit it fast.
5045000	5050000	But apparently, like, you know, you can do things where you're working together to meet a goal and maybe unlock a new avatar or something like that.
5050000	5054000	So that's the type of stuff they want to do for multiplayer.
5054000	5062000	But none of this, you know, versus stuff, which is interesting because if you played that mystery mode, which was kind of hidden in the demo.
5062000	5069000	And by the time most of you hear this, if you're not live, you know, the Tetris Effect demo is probably already done because it was a weekend demo.
5069000	5071000	And once they pull it, they pull it.
5071000	5073000	And even if you downloaded it, you can't play anymore.
5073000	5079000	But with the demo, they had the mystery mode in it, and it had all these ways to fuck with your pieces.
5079000	5085000	Like, it wasn't just pushing it up. It was about, like, they would spin rows. You would have a giant piece.
5085000	5089000	My favorite one was the one for a minute where you would get only three.
5089000	5092000	Like, instead of it four block pieces, you got three block pieces.
5092000	5101000	And it was actually kind of like a reward, I think, because you could put them into some harder to reach places and help to clear your board a little bit from some of the other ways that it would fuck with you.
5101000	5110000	And then the one that completely got me, and if you watch on stream, I know I had a hilarious reaction, was when all of a sudden the entire image flipped upside down.
5110000	5112000	And you just have to play the game upside down.
5112000	5117000	And it really, like, you know, left is right, right is left, and it just, like, completely fucks with you.
5117000	5120000	So, you know, because you're in the zone, that was a little rough.
5120000	5125000	So, I mean, it has kind of that same intensity that multiplayer would have a little bit, I think.
5125000	5129000	But, you know, for whatever reason, they decided not to put it in the game.
5129000	5133000	And it's fine. It really sounds like there's going to be a lot of stuff to enjoy in this game.
5133000	5136000	And I guess they're wanting to save something for the sequel, aren't they?
5136000	5137000	Sure.
5137000	5140000	Or maybe they don't want to step on the toes too hard with Puyo Puyo Tetris.
5140000	5143000	Because if you want, you can play a purely competitive Tetris.
5143000	5147000	You don't even have to have the Puyo stuff in it. You can just play Tetris on the Puyo Puyo Tetris.
5147000	5150000	So maybe that kind of went into it. I don't know.
5150000	5154000	But anyway, that's actually not the only game that's not going to have multiplayer.
5154000	5155000	Sorta.
5155000	5158000	This one's kind of surprising.
5158000	5162000	Civilization VI, as we know, is coming to the Nintendo Switch.
5162000	5165000	It's not going to have online multiplayer.
5165000	5166000	Right?
5166000	5169000	Right? Now, it has local multiplayer.
5169000	5173000	You can play locally, but it will not have online.
5173000	5177000	Which is something we've kind of gotten used to having in Civilization games ever since.
5177000	5180000	Like, I think even the second one had it built in.
5180000	5184000	I know the first one had Civ Net, which was a re-release of the first one just so you could play online.
5184000	5188000	But yeah, online Civilization play has always been a thing.
5188000	5191000	So it's a little weird that it's not in the Switch version.
5191000	5195000	But apparently a Reddit user spotted something kind of weird with the eShop
5195000	5198000	that talked about how you can play over local wireless.
5198000	5201000	And it didn't talk about anything online.
5201000	5204000	They say, a 2K spokesperson said via email,
5204000	5209000	Civilization VI for Nintendo Switch includes support for local cooperative and competitive multiplayer
5209000	5211000	for up to four players via a wireless network.
5211000	5214000	It will not have online multiplayer.
5214000	5217000	That's weird.
5217000	5218000	Yeah.
5218000	5220000	Do they not want to run the servers for it or something?
5220000	5222000	It's got to be something along those lines. I don't know.
5222000	5227000	Especially when you consider, when did they unveil Civilization VI?
5227000	5229000	Is it going to have, like, local multiplayer?
5229000	5232000	Yes, I just said. It's going to have plenty of the local.
5232000	5233000	So you can do that.
5233000	5236000	That's a long time, though, playing Civ. I mean, I don't know.
5236000	5239000	Honestly, the LAN local...
5239000	5242000	Are we not trying to sell this online thing that they have?
5242000	5243000	I mean, because...
5243000	5244000	That's what I was just saying.
5244000	5246000	When did they announce Civilization VI?
5246000	5247000	Do you remember, Loki?
5247000	5249000	What Nintendo Direct did they announce Civilization VI in?
5249000	5250000	During the multiplayer thing?
5250000	5252000	During the online presentation.
5252000	5253000	That's kind of weird.
5253000	5254000	Right?
5254000	5256000	That's the weird part to me.
5256000	5258000	Did they go back on it and change their mind?
5258000	5260000	I don't know. I don't know.
5260000	5264000	So what features are you providing us, Nintendo, with our online features?
5264000	5265000	What?
5265000	5267000	We have free Nintendo games.
5267000	5270000	Start to See You in Chat says, that's an important distinction.
5270000	5274000	Civ VI does have local multiplayer, though no online is a little weird.
5274000	5279000	I mean, why not something like the play-by-email model, where you can take your turn whenever?
5279000	5281000	Oh, God, I forgot that was a thing.
5281000	5285000	In one of the Civ games, I think it was Civ IV, you could play by email.
5285000	5289000	So you would email your move, and then somebody would open it up, take their move, email it back,
5289000	5290000	and that's how you would play.
5290000	5293000	Like, it would take you a fucking year to get through a game of Civilization that way.
5293000	5297000	I mean, I have... I seem to remember this was a thing.
5297000	5300000	Am I crazy, you guys, or was this a thing?
5300000	5304000	That, like, board game enthusiasts would set up an entire board game, like, in their living room,
5304000	5307000	and people would play via postcard.
5307000	5311000	Like, they would email their... or they would write it on postcard and send it and play by mail.
5311000	5313000	Like, that was a thing that people used to do.
5313000	5320000	Used to see that in the back of, like, these tabletop books or, like, magazines or...
5320000	5322000	So, like, I'm not crazy. That used to be a thing.
5322000	5326000	So, Civilization IV, I think it was IV. I'm sorry if I got the wrong version.
5326000	5330000	But it had something similar, but it was email. You played by email.
5330000	5333000	Kind of a fun little throwback to that, those sort of days.
5333000	5337000	So, Izet in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
5337000	5340000	My dad did that with war games. VidPower says, mail chess.
5340000	5342000	That's right, chess was a big thing for that.
5342000	5347000	Yeah, but unfortunately you can't do that with email and the Switch, because there's no email.
5347000	5349000	Yeah, I know, there's no email on the Switch. I know, I know.
5349000	5350000	But it's a cute idea.
5350000	5354000	I guess you could tie it with your phone app, because, hey, don't you all have phones?
5354000	5355000	What?
5359000	5361000	You asshole, that is so funny. All right.
5363000	5365000	Way to bring it full circle, Logie. All right.
5366000	5368000	We do have that wonderful phone app that...
5368000	5370000	No, I know, I know.
5370000	5373000	You know what? No, we shouldn't be inventing other ways that Civ can be online.
5373000	5375000	They should just have the fucking online mobile.
5375000	5378000	Maybe just tunnel it. People will just find a way to tunnel it.
5379000	5380000	Dungeon Buster says,
5380000	5385000	Online's not a huge thing with me for Civ games either, but it's unusual in mission.
5385000	5387000	Omission, excuse me.
5387000	5388000	Bobby Blackwell says,
5388000	5391000	The tagline for this episode is, Don't you all have phones?
5391000	5396000	You know what, though, to be fair, we don't put show quotes in our title.
5396000	5399000	That just never took off for this show, because we're too old, I guess.
5399000	5403000	But I bet those shows out there that do name their shows,
5403000	5405000	I bet you that title's going to show up a lot.
5406000	5409000	Because, you know, what do you mean you can't listen to this podcast?
5409000	5410000	Don't you all have phones?
5412000	5413000	All right, anyway.
5413000	5416000	Let's, you know what, let's go back to a simpler time when, no,
5416000	5418000	not everybody had phones.
5418000	5421000	Although, actually, I think with this particular game of the week,
5421000	5424000	you did have phones, but it was like the very first iPhone.
5424000	5425000	It was the very first one.
5425000	5426000	You had flip phones.
5426000	5428000	Or flip phones. Is that like my old, that old thing I used to,
5428000	5430000	you remember my flip phone I had when we lived together?
5430000	5432000	It was like, ooh, this thing takes pictures,
5432000	5435000	and it was like 64 by 64, like little pixel-sized things.
5435000	5437000	It was like grainy as fuck.
5437000	5439000	Anyway, we're going to take a trip down memory lane
5439000	5441000	with the classic game of the week.
5443000	5445000	And so we're going to take a step back,
5445000	5448000	and face, and time, and magic, and all that stuff,
5448000	5451000	and visit with Dark Sakura, thanks to Skype,
5451000	5452000	for our classic game of the week.
5452000	5453000	You there, Jamie?
5454000	5455000	I am.
5455000	5456000	Hi, Jamie, how are you?
5457000	5458000	I'm doing okay.
5458000	5459000	All right.
5459000	5460000	Lazy day.
5460000	5462000	Yeah, lazy day. It's been a lazy weekend.
5462000	5465000	But, you know, after Halloween, you expect, you know,
5465000	5466000	you need a little recovery time.
5466000	5468000	Because I don't know about you, but my Halloween was crazy.
5470000	5472000	Yeah, mine was, actually I spent it at work,
5472000	5475000	but it was still pretty fun.
5475000	5477000	Yeah, well, hey, that's a little crazy too.
5477000	5478000	Crazy money.
5478000	5479000	You're making some crazy money.
5480000	5481000	Yeah, really.
5481000	5483000	Oops, the wrong classic game of the week.
5483000	5485000	Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault
5485000	5487000	and find one game that she thinks,
5487000	5489000	hey, you brats should be paying attention to this game.
5489000	5492000	But in a little twist on the year, once a month,
5492000	5494000	she chooses a peripheral instead.
5494000	5498000	So I believe tonight we have a classic peripheral of the month
5498000	5499000	for the month of November.
5499000	5500000	Am I right?
5501000	5502000	Yes, you are correct.
5502000	5505000	I have chosen as our peripheral the Wii Balance Board,
5505000	5508000	or as it was called in Japan, Balenzu Wiibodou.
5509000	5510000	All right.
5510000	5514000	And the music tonight is actually coming from Wii Fit U,
5514000	5517000	because I had a really hard time finding the original Wii Fit,
5517000	5518000	like play stuff on YouTube.
5518000	5519000	It felt good.
5519000	5520000	Yeah.
5521000	5523000	Peripherals, no, no generation.
5524000	5525000	Exactly.
5525000	5526000	Well, and let's be real.
5526000	5528000	Wii Fit U is really just kind of like a cash in
5528000	5530000	to try to get people to come over to the Wii U.
5531000	5532000	Pretty much.
5533000	5536000	Anyway, the Wii Balance Board first came out in Japan
5536000	5538000	on December 10th, 2007,
5539000	5543000	in Europe on April 26th, 2008,
5543000	5545000	Australia May 8th, 2008,
5545000	5547000	and North America on May 19th, 2008.
5547000	5550000	And then in Korea in December 2008.
5550000	5554000	So it does actually fall under a 10-year range thing
5554000	5555000	for classic stuff,
5555000	5559000	but peripherals, like I said, no, no generation.
5559000	5561000	Well, no, it was a May...
5561000	5563000	Yeah, no, we're past May 2018,
5563000	5564000	so it's been over 10 years.
5565000	5566000	Right.
5566000	5569000	Well, anyway, it is shaped kind of like a scale,
5569000	5571000	like a full-body scale.
5571000	5573000	It's plain white and gray.
5573000	5575000	It runs on four AA batteries,
5575000	5578000	and it can power for about 60 hours.
5578000	5580000	It does use Bluetooth to connect,
5580000	5582000	and has four pressure sensors
5582000	5584000	to measure your center of balance.
5584000	5587000	So that's where it gets the control from,
5587000	5591000	is being a center of balance alignment tool.
5592000	5593000	It can...
5594000	5597000	It actually has been flaunted
5597000	5600000	that it can measure weight
5600000	5602000	better than the traditional bathroom scale.
5603000	5606000	I mean, it's designed to support,
5606000	5609000	for the Japanese one, up to 300 pounds,
5609000	5612000	and the Western version up to 330 pounds,
5612000	5615000	even though they are technically still the same device.
5615000	5619000	They had to let us have a little more weight here.
5620000	5621000	Huh?
5621000	5624000	I said they had to let us have a little more weight here.
5624000	5626000	Well, it really is still the same one.
5626000	5628000	It just has to do with the device calibration.
5628000	5629000	Ah.
5630000	5634000	But it actually has been compared to the Joy Board
5634000	5637000	that came out of the Atari VCS 1982.
5639000	5642000	But, of course, you know, the Wii Balance Board
5642000	5645000	is quite a bit more, I'd say, advanced.
5647000	5649000	And so, basically,
5651000	5655000	you can actually get Wii Fit non-skid socks
5655000	5657000	that were provided to members of Club Nintendo.
5659000	5662000	I know people who used the socks that were given
5662000	5664000	at Kaiser whenever they had surgery.
5665000	5666000	Hmm.
5666000	5669000	They pretty much, you know, just no skid hospital socks.
5670000	5674000	At any rate, there are a few games
5674000	5676000	that will support the balance board,
5676000	5678000	of course Wii Fit being the main one.
5679000	5681000	It was actually said that, you know,
5681000	5683000	there were lots of third-party inquiries,
5683000	5685000	you know, after it was announced.
5685000	5687000	But they were also saying that
5687000	5689000	the most straightforward game to come out for it
5689000	5691000	would be some kind of snowboarding game.
5691000	5693000	And so Wii Ski by Bondi Namco
5693000	5697000	was the first third-party game to make use of the balance board.
5697000	5702000	And it would also use the remote and nunchuck attachment as well.
5703000	5705000	As far as games that will support it,
5705000	5708000	there actually are a number of games that will,
5708000	5712000	including All Star Cheer Squad by THQ,
5714000	5716000	The Biggest Loser,
5717000	5720000	CDR Hottest Party and Music Sit,
5720000	5722000	and CDR Revolution,
5722000	5726000	although I don't exactly understand how it would accurately use it.
5727000	5730000	EA Sports NFL Training Camp,
5730000	5733000	The Garfield Show that The Threat of Space was on ya.
5734000	5735000	What?
5735000	5737000	Gets it with Mel B.
5738000	5739000	Oh, nice.
5739000	5744000	Another game by Marvelous Entertainment called Ikenie no Yoru,
5744000	5746000	Avatar the Game,
5747000	5749000	quite a few of course fitness games,
5749000	5752000	Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party,
5752000	5753000	Punch-Out! used it,
5753000	5755000	Super Monkey Ball Step and Roll,
5755000	5756000	Tetris Party Deluxe,
5756000	5758000	I'm just picking like some weird ones on here,
5758000	5764000	and then of course the WiiWare games were using it too.
5764000	5766000	So there was that.
5767000	5771000	But a few other things about it is that it reads the center of pressure.
5771000	5776000	It actually is a proven tool for assessing center pressure displacement,
5776000	5784000	so it could be used for different medical conditions to help with balance and treatment thereof.
5785000	5789000	It sold 32 million units worldwide at launch,
5790000	5798000	and that means that it was awarded a Guinness World Record for best selling personal weighing device.
5799000	5803000	By January 2012, it sold 42 million units.
5804000	5806000	And there you go, the Wii Balance Board,
5806000	5810000	or Banasui Bodo in Japanese.
5810000	5812000	I never really thought of that,
5812000	5816000	that like there's so many different types of scales and things that you can buy for your home
5816000	5821000	that the Wii Fit Balance Board was so huge that it actually was the most popular scale
5821000	5823000	for people to have in their home in a way.
5823000	5824000	It's so weird.
5824000	5825000	That it did.
5825000	5828000	Video games, their impact, amazing.
5828000	5829000	Right?
5829000	5830000	Yeah.
5830000	5836000	Well there it is, your classic peripheral of the month, the Wii Fit Balance Board.
5836000	5839000	See, I thought this was going to be another thing kind of like when you did Steel Battalion,
5839000	5842000	how it was kind of like the game and the peripheral kind of go together,
5842000	5843000	but really not really.
5843000	5849000	I kind of forgot just how big this thing was and how many games all really supported it
5849000	5852000	because so many people bought Wii Fit.
5853000	5857000	Well yeah, like there's some other ones, like there was the Champion Jockey game,
5857000	5861000	there was Dream Dance and Cheer, Don King Boxing.
5861000	5864000	So a lot of those, I mean we know that the Wii ended up being like,
5864000	5870000	I don't want to say necessarily like a shovel ground for those fitness games, but kinda.
5871000	5872000	You know what I mean?
5872000	5878000	Yeah, but I mean, and I'm looking at just the list of non-fitness-y games.
5878000	5880000	Like I said, there was Rayman in there.
5880000	5881000	Yeah.
5881000	5883000	There was, well Mario and Sonic used it.
5883000	5884000	Yeah.
5884000	5886000	Let's play Ballerina.
5887000	5889000	Okay Jamie, when will we play Ballerina?
5889000	5891000	That's something that was definitely an evaluage.
5891000	5894000	Yeah, no, I think it's cool.
5894000	5898000	We kind of forget a little bit just how versatile this was, you know,
5898000	5904000	and it was a Nintendo peripheral that really took off in the way that not every peripheral necessarily does.
5904000	5909000	Like, you know, a DDR dance mat wasn't probably used in that many games.
5909000	5912000	I know it ended up being in a few things besides just DDR, but it wasn't like that many.
5912000	5916000	You know, Guitar Hero, Guitar Controller doesn't get used in that many other games,
5916000	5918000	although there was a couple here and there, you know what I mean?
5918000	5922000	It's just the balance board is just so big and hugely adopted,
5922000	5927000	and ten years old now, which, you know, means everybody out there listening.
5927000	5928000	You know what that means?
5928000	5929000	You're old too.
5932000	5936000	Alright, well Jamie, sad to not have you in studio again this week,
5936000	5940000	but I hope everything's going good with work, and I know we'll get you back in here soon,
5940000	5944000	but anything else we need to talk about during your week before we head back to the main show?
5944000	5948000	I've started playing Magikarp Jump.
5948000	5952000	Oh God, you were telling me about how you're addicted to that on the phone, right?
5952000	5954000	It's so stupid, and it's really cute.
5954000	5955000	Hey, what do you think about this?
5955000	5960000	Because I know this is a controversy we're going to tackle tonight on the show,
5960000	5964000	and I definitely would welcome your opinion because I know you're a fan of many Blizzard products,
5964000	5967000	having played things like World of Warcraft and so forth over the years,
5967000	5973000	but, you know, a really negative reception happening to the Diablo mobile game announcement.
5973000	5976000	How do you feel about Diablo going mobile?
5976000	5981000	I'll be honest, I didn't even know it was happening until you just now said it.
5981000	5982000	Yeah, it was...
5982000	5985000	That's how out of Diablo I am.
5985000	5987000	Yeah, it was kind of their big announcement.
5987000	5988000	It was the very end.
5988000	5991000	I mean, which is interesting because they announced a Warcraft 3 remaster,
5991000	5994000	and I've got to be careful because I don't want to repeat what I'm going to say during the live show,
5994000	5999000	but, you know, this was like the big tent pole they saved for the end was Diablo Immortal,
5999000	6003000	their cell phone game, and a lot of people, like even at BlizzCon,
6003000	6006000	somebody asked a question in one of those Q&A panels.
6006000	6010000	It was like, is this an April Fool's joke, which I kind of cringed a little bit
6010000	6012000	because I was like, wow, that's like super disrespectful,
6012000	6016000	but it also kind of shows like the fan base is like really mad, yo.
6017000	6018000	Mm-mm.
6018000	6019000	Yeah.
6019000	6020000	All right.
6020000	6025000	Well, you know, I think having a mobile Diablo, though,
6025000	6029000	really isn't so much of a bad thing because it definitely expands the user base
6029000	6034000	and it would definitely, I don't know,
6034000	6040000	it sounds like it would actually be fairly good to have on a phone.
6040000	6041000	I mean, it sounds like it would be fun.
6041000	6042000	Yeah, yeah.
6042000	6043000	It's kind of a little bit where my head's at.
6043000	6045000	Like they could have announced it in a much better way,
6045000	6048000	but I think at the end of the day, all of these haters are going to try it.
6048000	6049000	It's going to be free.
6049000	6052000	Like I kind of think y'all are kidding yourselves
6052000	6054000	if you're not going to at least download it.
6056000	6057000	No, I'd probably give it a shot.
6057000	6058000	We'll see.
6058000	6060000	But actually, I kind of want to start playing WoW again.
6060000	6061000	I've been paying for it.
6061000	6063000	I may as well, you know, play it.
6063000	6064000	Good idea.
6064000	6065000	All right.
6065000	6066000	Well, Jamie, we're going to get back to the main show.
6066000	6069000	Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight before we head back?
6070000	6072000	Vote and don't vote stupidly.
6074000	6076000	Don't vote a party ticket.
6076000	6080000	Read everything and vote after lots of research.
6082000	6083000	That's all I have to say.
6089000	6090000	Voting is important, y'all.
6090000	6091000	Don't forget about it.
6091000	6094000	Those of you that are in the U.S., voting day is Tuesday,
6094000	6096000	and hopefully y'all registered to vote already.
6096000	6099000	But many states do allow you to register the day of
6099000	6100000	if for whatever reason you missed it.
6100000	6103000	Just don't forget to vote, you know, as Jamie said there.
6103000	6106000	Educate yourself on the issues and vote accordingly.
6106000	6107000	Please, please.
6107000	6109000	Anyway, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio,
6109000	6111000	our 751st show already in progress.
6111000	6114000	We've had a fun show so far talking about all this stuff.
6114000	6116000	We had Shane on talking about The Quiet Man,
6116000	6118000	which was a fun conversation.
6118000	6119000	We were also talking about Diablo Immortal,
6119000	6122000	which I was also, you know, pinging Jamie about a little bit there
6122000	6123000	at the end of that segment.
6123000	6126000	But while we were away in Radio Magic land,
6126000	6129000	you were looking up what, memes about Diablo?
6129000	6131000	I was just looking up, reading Reddit,
6131000	6133000	but, like, there's several memes already,
6133000	6135000	just with the whole online thing.
6135000	6137000	So, like, they have one with Sakurai.
6137000	6139000	You know, it's clearly from the Smash Direct.
6139000	6141000	It's like, some of you might be upset
6141000	6144000	over the lack of basic online functionality built into the Switch,
6144000	6146000	and then you see him just kind of sigh,
6146000	6147000	and then it shows the phones up.
6147000	6149000	Do you guys not have phones?
6149000	6153000	Great, great.
6153000	6156000	When you managed to slam two companies in your meme,
6156000	6157000	that's pretty impressive.
6157000	6160000	And, you know, while we were doing the first segment there,
6160000	6162000	one of my Ingress buddies, who I think is actually listening,
6162000	6166000	is that, actually sent me a picture, I guess, that was taken at BlizzCon.
6166000	6169000	This isn't really a meme, but it's like a BlizzCon picture
6169000	6172000	of, like, basically nobody playing Diablo Immortal.
6172000	6173000	But I was looking in the background, I'm like,
6173000	6175000	okay, well, nobody's there.
6175000	6176000	Like, they took this after closing or something.
6176000	6178000	Like, you can see, there's nobody in the background either.
6178000	6180000	I'm like, I don't think it's just that booth.
6180000	6182000	But apparently, it was pulled from Reddit,
6182000	6186000	and it actually says that it was during the concert,
6186000	6188000	but there was nobody at Diablo Mobile,
6188000	6191000	and some of the others had, like, 10 to 20.
6191000	6194000	There were some other lines that did have people in it.
6194000	6195000	You just can't see it in the picture.
6195000	6198000	But it was during the concert, so a little bit of in-between.
6198000	6203000	But apparently, not a lot of people in line to play Diablo Immortal at that point.
6203000	6207000	So, something that I'm sure Blizzard is noticing too.
6207000	6213000	So, apparently, I know when I've gone to conventions before,
6213000	6215000	they click how many people come through the line.
6215000	6217000	Like, I'm almost positive the Final Fantasy Fan Fest is one of these.
6217000	6220000	They'll have a clicker when you get to the front of the line and go play.
6220000	6223000	So, they know exactly how many people come through,
6223000	6225000	and they'll be able to report that back.
6225000	6228000	And if it seems like the Diablo thing is getting really low engagement
6228000	6230000	for what was supposed to be their tentpole release,
6230000	6232000	again, as I was kind of saying earlier,
6232000	6233000	I don't want to revisit this topic completely,
6233000	6236000	but I do think Blizzard is going to be like,
6236000	6240000	okay, again, 8.30 a.m. Monday morning, shut the door.
6240000	6242000	What the fuck happened at BlizzCon, everybody?
6243000	6245000	It's going to be a conversation.
6245000	6248000	We'll have to see what follows up a little later.
6248000	6250000	All right, anyway, let's see.
6250000	6253000	Vidpower in chat says, the time of day matters too.
6253000	6257000	There's a pic floating around with all of the Diablo Immortal stations being played at one point.
6257000	6260000	Yeah, probably right when it first came out,
6260000	6263000	because I'm sure there's a lot of people like me too.
6263000	6266000	Like, if you haven't figured it out, I'm very much of this mindset of,
6266000	6268000	I don't hate it.
6268000	6271000	I'm probably not going to play it obsessively,
6271000	6273000	but I'll download it and try it,
6273000	6276000	and I'll be sad that I didn't actually get a Diablo 3 expansion,
6276000	6279000	but then I'll remember that Blizzard's just fucking slow,
6279000	6281000	and there'll be a Diablo 4 eventually,
6281000	6283000	and this may or may not really be for me,
6283000	6285000	but I'm kidding myself if I'm sitting here going,
6285000	6287000	I play a shit ton of mobile games.
6287000	6289000	I play Pokemon Go, Ingress,
6289000	6291000	The Great League of the Lost,
6291000	6293000	and all this other stuff I was mentioning in the first segment.
6293000	6294000	Like, of course I'm going to try it.
6294000	6297000	Could it be that people feel that they're entitled to bigger news
6297000	6300000	because they paid $200 or whatever to get into BlizzCon?
6300000	6302000	When it comes to dude who asked,
6302000	6304000	is this an April Fool's joke?
6304000	6306000	Absolutely.
6306000	6309000	Entitlement is, I think, a keyword there.
6309000	6312000	It's one that's being flung around on Twitter quite a bit
6312000	6317000	with, I think, mixed truth,
6317000	6320000	but, you know, I think entitlement's sure.
6320000	6322000	Like I said, that guy who asked that question,
6322000	6324000	you paid $200 to be there.
6324000	6326000	Congrats, kid. You played yourself.
6326000	6328000	Blizzard got your money, and they don't even want money
6328000	6330000	for Diablo Immortal to download.
6330000	6332000	Let's not.
6332000	6335000	Yeah, they don't want money to install it on your system,
6335000	6337000	but, oh, they want your money.
6337000	6338000	I know.
6338000	6340000	They want all of your money.
6340000	6344000	They want your money, but I think a big meeting's going to happen Monday,
6344000	6345000	and we'll see.
6345000	6347000	Anyway, I don't want to rehash part A.
6347000	6349000	We've got to get into some more news here in part B.
6349000	6351000	If you want to rehash it, though,
6351000	6353000	we will welcome your phone calls on all these subjects later.
6353000	6356000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
6356000	6358000	Be sure to add us on Skype if you haven't already.
6358000	6360000	Somebody was trying to get through last week and couldn't.
6360000	6363000	It's because I hadn't seen their request and accepted it,
6363000	6365000	so you do have to, like, add us on Skype.
6365000	6366000	I think that helps you get through.
6366000	6370000	I may have locked that down because of spammers some time ago,
6370000	6371000	because I don't know if you guys remember,
6371000	6374000	we used to get, like, full-on, like, faxes, phone calls,
6374000	6376000	so I think you have to be on our contact list to call us.
6376000	6378000	No, seeing as spammers, like, I hadn't checked my PlayStation messages
6378000	6381000	for a long time, and there were so many, like, bots.
6381000	6383000	Change your privacy settings so that only, like,
6383000	6384000	friends of friends can message you.
6384000	6385000	It'll help a lot.
6385000	6387000	Yeah, it's just like, delete, delete, delete, delete.
6387000	6388000	Yeah, that's irritating.
6388000	6389000	Totally irritating.
6389000	6390000	All right, let's move on.
6390000	6391000	Rapid Fire News.
6391000	6392000	What else do we have, Loki?
6392000	6396000	So there's a pretty good chance that Sunset Overdrive is heading to PC.
6396000	6402000	This is because the Korean's rating board listed a PC port of the version of the game.
6402000	6409000	Of course, also the ESRB has also added a listing for the PC version of the game as well,
6409000	6412000	so perhaps we'll be getting a PC port soon,
6412000	6416000	and maybe they'll be part of that whole, you know, expanded Game Pass service.
6416000	6422000	I would definitely pick it up on PC, because I wanted to play the game on Xbox One,
6422000	6424000	but I don't have an Xbox One, so, you know.
6424000	6428000	I grabbed it on that lovely Games with Gold thing,
6428000	6431000	so I can play it on Xbox One eventually.
6431000	6432000	Yeah.
6432000	6438000	And then, of course, for the month of November, we have our free games now,
6438000	6442000	so for PlayStation, we had originally kind of talked about rumor,
6442000	6443000	because they had leaked it out a little bit,
6443000	6445000	but all of those rumored games are coming out,
6445000	6450000	so Bulletstorm Full Clip Edition and Yakuza Kiwami on PlayStation 4,
6450000	6455000	the Jackbox Party Pack 2 and Arkido series on PlayStation 3,
6455000	6458000	and then the Vita games, which are also crossed by PlayStation 4,
6458000	6460000	Burly Man at Sea and Roundabout.
6460000	6462000	I already have Roundabout.
6462000	6464000	Oh, I did buy that game, though.
6464000	6467000	So that's going to be coming out as well in November.
6467000	6473000	And then on the Xbox side of things, we've got Battlefield 1,
6473000	6474000	which is pretty awesome.
6474000	6477000	That's going to be out for the month of November,
6477000	6482000	and then Race the Sun from the second half of November to the middle of December,
6482000	6484000	and then your Xbox 360 compatible titles,
6484000	6487000	Assassin's Creed for the first half of November,
6487000	6490000	and Dante's Inferno for the second half of November.
6490000	6492000	Pretty solid lineup.
6492000	6493000	Yeah.
6493000	6494000	I want to check out the Dante's Inferno,
6494000	6496000	because I never did when it was originally out.
6496000	6498000	I'd rather have Battlefield 1 than...
6498000	6502000	Yeah, but you know I'm not a big Battlefield War game type of guy,
6502000	6505000	but I guess when it's free, it's hard to complain.
6505000	6506000	Yeah.
6506000	6509000	Bonz006 says, Bulletstorm, I must say, I like that game.
6509000	6510000	Yeah.
6510000	6513000	Are the PS Plus stuff already gone live, or is that this next week?
6513000	6515000	I think it's this next week. It was delayed.
6515000	6518000	The ones that are up now are definitely worth grabbing,
6518000	6521000	because they have the Tron-looking game is up there now,
6521000	6523000	and what, Friday the 13th, I think?
6523000	6524000	Friday the 13th.
6524000	6526000	Yeah, so I remember triggering something else on there, too.
6526000	6529000	There's a lot of good stuff right now, so kind of a reminder to you.
6529000	6531000	I know this week, yeah, they should be switching them over this week,
6531000	6534000	so just get a chance to go grab that.
6534000	6535000	Yeah, yeah.
6535000	6540000	All right, anyhow, we want to get to some more news,
6540000	6543000	including Castlevania, which some of you are watching on Netflix.
6543000	6545000	Netflix apparently knocking that out of the park
6545000	6546000	with some of the Halloween programming.
6546000	6547000	I'm seeing nothing but...
6547000	6550000	Disclaimer, I haven't watched any of this myself.
6550000	6553000	I've only heard of it through other people,
6553000	6555000	but apparently the Haunting of Hill House show is phenomenal.
6555000	6557000	Yeah, my wife said it was too scary to watch,
6557000	6558000	so she's not watching it.
6558000	6559000	Oh, boy, okay.
6559000	6561000	I was like, well, now I kind of want to see it, but...
6561000	6562000	Now you want to watch it.
6562000	6563000	I hear Sabrina's great.
6563000	6565000	The Reimagining of Sabrina is really good.
6565000	6566000	That's the one I really want to see,
6566000	6568000	because I actually liked Riverdale.
6568000	6571000	And then apparently Castlevania is also really good,
6571000	6572000	and apparently in this season,
6572000	6575000	they actually incorporate Bloody Tears in some of the music.
6575000	6577000	Yeah, I still haven't seen the first season yet.
6577000	6579000	I need to watch it, but...
6579000	6580000	Well, you're going to have to catch up,
6580000	6582000	because not only do you need to watch season two now,
6582000	6584000	but there is going to be a season three.
6584000	6587000	That's right, Netflix did confirm Castlevania will be back
6587000	6588000	for a third season.
6588000	6589000	It is going to be loosely...
6589000	6592000	I guess the whole series is based on Castlevania III,
6592000	6593000	Dracula's Curse,
6593000	6595000	but the anime's been pretty well received.
6595000	6597000	Apparently the writing is really good,
6597000	6599000	and the same writer's going to be coming back
6599000	6601000	for the third season to continue as a writer
6601000	6603000	and executive producer.
6603000	6604000	Apparently rumors that...
6604000	6607000	Big rumors that one of the show's executive producers,
6607000	6610000	apparently Adi Shankar,
6610000	6613000	may be doing a Zelda thing.
6613000	6615000	Haven't heard a lot more than that than just rumors,
6615000	6617000	but I think that would be really interesting.
6617000	6619000	Also, speaking of people wanting to do things,
6619000	6621000	this didn't really make our show roll tonight,
6621000	6623000	but did you see that whole tweet where Brie Larson,
6623000	6625000	who's Captain Marvel, right?
6625000	6628000	She's a Sacramento local, someone from our town.
6628000	6632000	Brie Larson wore that Zero Suit Samus outfit for Halloween,
6632000	6634000	and somebody kind of asked her about a Metroid movie,
6634000	6637000	and I'm paraphrasing, but she basically said,
6637000	6638000	let's make it happen.
6638000	6639000	I would love to do it.
6639000	6641000	Yeah, they said that this is going to be the closest
6641000	6644000	we're going to get to a live action Metroid movie,
6644000	6645000	and she's like, I hope not,
6645000	6648000	because I would love to play that character.
6648000	6650000	And Brie Larson as Samus?
6650000	6652000	I'm good with that.
6652000	6653000	I'd like to see that, yeah.
6653000	6656000	I've been a fan of hers ever since Scott Pilgrim.
6656000	6658000	Oh yeah, she was in that.
6658000	6661000	Yeah, all those Scott Pilgrim throwaway roles
6661000	6665000	and people in them, they're all huge now.
6665000	6667000	It's kind of something else. It's weird.
6667000	6670000	That movie, by the way, is also on Netflix now.
6670000	6671000	Is it?
6671000	6674000	If I saw that, I'd be like, oh, I want to watch that again.
6674000	6676000	Because you guys know on the side,
6676000	6678000	I do cult cinema hosting, right?
6678000	6680000	I've done Rocky Horror for years,
6680000	6683000	and I sometimes will do Repo, the genetic opera, Clue.
6683000	6686000	I've done a basic cult cinema hosting over the years.
6686000	6689000	I had a lot of fun when we did a doubleheader.
6689000	6691000	We did Kung Fury, whichever you're excited about.
6691000	6692000	Yeah, I'm sad that I missed that.
6692000	6694000	Yeah, because we had Thor there in person.
6694000	6695000	That would have been awesome.
6695000	6697000	Yeah, doing the Q&A with him was fun.
6697000	6698000	But then the second movie we did,
6698000	6700000	we did Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.
6700000	6702000	Did everyone throw coins?
6702000	6704000	Oh, I wish we thought of that.
6704000	6705000	That's a good idea.
6705000	6707000	No, nobody really threw things.
6707000	6708000	It wasn't total Rocky Horror.
6708000	6710000	But there was something about watching it again
6710000	6712000	on the big screen.
6712000	6714000	I don't know if Shane's still in chat,
6714000	6715000	but I dragged Shane to this.
6715000	6717000	Shane won't see Rocky Horror,
6717000	6719000	but he went to see this because it was like,
6719000	6720000	okay, that I'd go see.
6720000	6722000	And I think he actually had a really good time,
6722000	6724000	and I did too because there was something about watching it
6724000	6727000	with a group of other people who are just nerds
6727000	6729000	and happy to be there that actually made the movie
6729000	6730000	a lot of fun.
6730000	6733000	So I don't know if that movie just came out at a bad time.
6733000	6734000	It was ahead of its time.
6734000	6736000	I don't know what, but that Scott Pilgrim's a lot of fun.
6736000	6737000	It's ahead of its time.
6737000	6738000	Yeah.
6738000	6739000	It's a great movie.
6739000	6740000	I love it.
6740000	6742000	And Shane gives his raving reveal in our chat saying,
6742000	6743000	yeah, I liked it.
6743000	6744000	Great movie.
6744000	6745000	That's five stars from Shane.
6745000	6748000	Great movie and great game,
6748000	6750000	because they have the pixel art beat-em-up game.
6750000	6752000	That was a great game.
6752000	6753000	All right, anyway.
6753000	6754000	Also in rapid fire news,
6754000	6758000	the story I meant to talk about was the great PT debacle.
6758000	6759000	Did you hear about this?
6759000	6760000	Yeah.
6760000	6762000	Apparently Konami kills, well, here's the,
6762000	6765000	apparently the internet rumors started this big thing on Twitter,
6765000	6768000	and I admit I bought into it because there were screenshot proof.
6768000	6771000	So I thought, you know, but I guess it was, anyway,
6771000	6775000	apparently Konami was accused of pulling the kill switch on PT,
6775000	6780000	basically releasing a tiny little patch that disabled it completely.
6780000	6784000	So it was a nasty little Halloween trick because a lot of streamers were
6784000	6787000	getting excited to play PT on Halloween because what a good, you know,
6787000	6791000	it was a great scary game, but apparently through some follow-up and such,
6791000	6793000	a lot of people are saying, I never got that patch.
6793000	6794000	I didn't get that patch.
6794000	6796000	It doesn't look like that patch actually exists.
6796000	6801000	So either one person only got that patch or they made up a nasty little
6801000	6802000	Halloween trick themselves.
6802000	6803000	They made up a nasty little...
6803000	6807000	Now before we all talk about how we should apologize profusely to
6807000	6809000	Konami, here's the thing though.
6809000	6811000	The fact that it was believable as it was,
6811000	6815000	Konami doesn't exactly have the best reputation in the gaming industry right
6815000	6819000	now. And they did kind of dick PT over in a lot of other ways. Well,
6819000	6821000	I mean, canceling Silent Hills was probably one of the biggest,
6821000	6822000	but you know what I mean?
6822000	6825000	Like the fact that you can't even like download it and all this other stuff,
6825000	6826000	it's a little...
6826000	6828000	Well, it's also not, let's not put it past them because I mean,
6828000	6832000	after all they did also remove Hideo Kojima's name off the cover of,
6832000	6837000	you know, or any mention to him in, um, you know,
6837000	6840000	Metal Gear Solid 5 and I don't know.
6840000	6842000	Yeah. Dart Tetsuya in chat kind of sums it up saying, yeah,
6842000	6846000	this isn't really out of the realm of possibility for them to do so.
6846000	6848000	That's not a good look. I mean,
6848000	6851000	would you believe this story from any other gaming company? I don't know,
6851000	6853000	but, uh, that was it.
6853000	6857000	They seem like a special kind of spiteful to do something like that though.
6857000	6861000	If you buy into all the talk about some of the stuff they did to Kojima and
6861000	6866000	all this, apparently now Kibadea too. Like apparently they're just not nice people.
6866000	6869000	It sounds like. So anyway,
6869000	6872000	let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games
6872000	6877000	that will be coming out to a game store near you or online very soon. Loki.
6877000	6880000	All right. So we've got, um,
6880000	6884000	on the switch moonlighter and then, uh,
6884000	6886000	we have carnival games coming out on the switch as well.
6886000	6891000	De Rescini, I have no idea how to pronounce this.
6892000	6897000	Um, I think it's, Oh,
6897000	6901000	but it looks cool though. Uh, De Rescini, I guess.
6901000	6906000	It's a game by armored, the armored core team from software. Um,
6906000	6909000	it's a VR game, PlayStation VR. I'm down.
6909000	6912000	I don't know what it is or how to pronounce the fucking name,
6912000	6916000	but if it's a PS VR game by from software, yes.
6916000	6920000	Yeah. Um, let's see.
6920000	6925000	And then we've got the forest, which is a Sarava game on PlayStation four, uh,
6925000	6929000	grip on the switch, which I believe is a racing game. Uh,
6929000	6934000	omen of sorrow on PlayStation four over kills the walking dead on PC and the
6937000	6942000	world of final fantasy maxima on PC switch PlayStation four and Xbox one.
6942000	6945000	Oh yeah. I forgot they were re releasing that. Yeah. Yeah.
6945000	6949000	And then of course, last but not least on Friday,
6949000	6952000	Tetris effect on PlayStation four. Uh,
6952000	6954000	some comments with releases in our chat. Uh,
6954000	6957000	Shane says Loki is going to be so disappointed with that VR game from,
6957000	6961000	from software. Is there, is there reasoning?
6961000	6963000	Is there evidence to support that claim? I don't know.
6963000	6965000	Curious what that's about. Maybe I will be. I don't know.
6965000	6969000	S two and a hundred. Matt says, yeah, the forest. Great creepy game.
6969000	6971000	I could be, you know,
6971000	6976000	I had to look up some screenshots now cause it's possible.
6976000	6978000	Maybe my expectations are too high.
6979000	6984000	You high expectations.
6984000	6986000	It's all right. Software though. Uh,
6986000	6990000	Shane says it's like you're a ghost or something in a school. Oh, lame.
6990000	6994000	All right. So it's not a, it's not a mech warrior game then. No,
6994000	6997000	that would be the one that's coming on the switch at some point. That's why.
6997000	7000000	All right, well let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases
7000000	7001000	over in Japan. So this week,
7001000	7004000	uh, there's really just one to look forward to on the PlayStation four.
7004000	7007000	It's Dara CNA I think is how you would pronounce the one that I was just
7007000	7011000	talking about. Yeah. Dara CNA is also out, uh, in Japan this week.
7011000	7013000	So I guess it's a worldwide release if you will.
7013000	7016000	And that really does appear to be the only major release on the PlayStation
7016000	7020000	four this week. A Vita is slowing down as we kind of alluded to earlier in the
7020000	7022000	show. They have no releases this week. Uh,
7022000	7025000	the Nintendo switch has a little bit more going on though.
7025000	7027000	They have a Pika chin kit, game day,
7027000	7030000	pyramechi daisatsu Sen. Uh, and then, uh,
7030000	7035000	they also have, uh, the, some amiibo coming out on the ninth.
7035000	7039000	Uh, their splatoon two series with the octoling girl, boy and octopus.
7039000	7042000	That is all out in Japan this week. Now that I read up on this,
7042000	7045000	it's a VR debut from director, uh,
7045000	7050000	Hidetaka Miyazaki and from software Miyazaki and from software together,
7050000	7054000	probably going to be Cooney. No, that was level five. Hmm. I don't know.
7054000	7057000	We'll, we'll see. I, I, I'm a little bit more optimistic now,
7057000	7062000	but check it out. All right. Uh, anyway, let's move over to the UK.
7063000	7067000	Loki, do you have those two? Yes. So, uh, coming out in the UK,
7067000	7071000	probably kind of the same type of stuff. We have carnival games on the switch,
7071000	7075000	uh, grip on the switch, PlayStation four,
7075000	7080000	Xbox one and PC ride three on, uh,
7080000	7085000	PlayStation four and Xbox one and PC 11 11
7085000	7090000	memories retold on PlayStation four and Xbox one,
7090000	7093000	uh, NBA two K playgrounds two on PlayStation four,
7093000	7098000	Xbox one and the switch moonlighter on PlayStation four
7098000	7102000	and the switch hit man to gold edition. Um,
7102000	7107000	that's going to be coming out on the PlayStation four and Xbox
7107000	7111000	one. And then, uh, oh, actually a few more, uh, the Sims four expansion,
7111000	7115000	get famous, uh, Minecraft. And that was, that's on PC, uh,
7115000	7119000	Minecraft story mode season two on the switch and the Gianna Swister or
7120000	7124000	Gianna sisters, twisted dreams, ultimate edition on the switch.
7124000	7129000	That's it. I didn't see any, uh, no Tetris effect over there.
7129000	7133000	Yeah. Um, or maybe it's online only or something. I don't know.
7133000	7135000	Maybe they're not doing a physical release over there.
7135000	7138000	Maybe it's just not on your list for whatever. That's strange. No. All right.
7138000	7139000	Well anyhow, uh,
7139000	7143000	let's go to the mailbag because every week you guys would send us emails over
7143000	7147000	at participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us emails.
7148000	7152000	And this is the part of the show where we would read them if we had any.
7152000	7154000	Sadly, it's an empty mailbag this week.
7154000	7159000	I guess we got to talk about failed us drag race or what was it?
7159000	7161000	Oh, that's right. Cause we have to fill in talk with drag race.
7161000	7164000	We don't get emails. We have to talk about RuPaul's drag race. Um, okay.
7164000	7168000	They're going to be doing a RuPaul's drag race Christmas special this year that
7168000	7171000	was announced this week. A one off Christmas special, uh,
7171000	7176000	that is going to feature Trixie Mattel and Latrice Royale and a lot of these
7176000	7179000	big names, plus some people we haven't seen in a while, like Sonique from season two.
7179000	7183000	Uh, but shangela is in it and considering all her game of thrones references,
7183000	7186000	the fact that she was robbed in all stars three, the fact that, you know,
7186000	7187000	with all the game of thrones,
7187000	7190000	she could just say winter is coming and that she's known for a lot of her
7190000	7193000	Christmas looks like just fucking crown it like shangela's already won.
7193000	7195000	It's going to be shangela versus Trixie in the end,
7195000	7197000	but this time they're going to crown shangela and that's, that's,
7197000	7199000	that's how, wow, world of wonder and everything we balance.
7199000	7201000	All things should be, that's right.
7201000	7204000	Everything balance will be as much as I love Trixie Mattel. I really do. Uh,
7204000	7208000	all stars three with some, some messed up stuff. Don't you agree? Loki?
7208000	7210000	Wasn't that messed up? All stars three.
7210000	7213000	Having no context of what you're talking about right now. I will,
7213000	7218000	I'll hesitate and agree. Yes. Okay. All right.
7218000	7222000	That's enough punishment. Let's get into, uh, some more gaming news. Uh,
7222000	7224000	but if you want to, uh, talk about something other than RuPaul's drag race,
7224000	7225000	you can send us an email.
7225000	7229000	Participate at orange launch trader.com is the place to send us an email in a
7229000	7230000	future week. Loki.
7230000	7234000	So we finally got the announcement of the full roster of games.
7234000	7238000	They're going to be a part of the PlayStation classic. So starting in,
7238000	7241000	apparently it is in different regions. They have different games.
7241000	7244000	So let's start off with what we're getting in North America.
7244000	7249000	Battle riatoshi then cool borders to destruction Derby,
7249000	7253000	final fantasy seven grand theft auto intelligent cube jumping flash.
7253000	7255000	Mel, you're solid. Mr driller, odd world,
7255000	7259000	rolled Abe's odyssey Rayman resident evil director's cup,
7259000	7264000	revelations persona Ridge racer type form super puzzle fighter to turbo siphon
7265000	7270000	filter tech and three Tom Clancy's rainbow six twisted or twisted Mel and wild
7272000	7276000	arms. Uh, so those are all going to be coming to the North American version.
7276000	7277000	Um,
7277000	7281000	lots of games that I'm surprised are missing from that list that I would have
7281000	7283000	thought that they weren't been there. Like, you know,
7284000	7286000	per rap of a rapper, um,
7286000	7289000	might have been one or even like Ein hinder or something like that.
7289000	7292000	Now in Japan, it's all stuff that's being remastered.
7292000	7294000	It's all stuff that's been remastered somewhere else.
7294000	7296000	So they don't want to put it on, but Japan seems to be getting the better of
7296000	7300000	the two, you know, releases. Cause over there they're getting arc of the lad,
7300000	7304000	arc of the lad to armored core. Um,
7304000	7307000	Grady has guide in. Um,
7308000	7313000	I think it's not sigh saga, frontier G Darius and parasite Eve.
7315000	7318000	Those are all the exclusive ones. And then on top of that,
7318000	7322000	Richard's type four intelligent cube, uh, jumping flash, puzzle fighter,
7322000	7326000	tech and three battle re-enthusiastic and resident evil, uh,
7326000	7330000	file 57, Mr. Driller persona, Miller, your soul and wild arms.
7330000	7334000	I would rather have the Japanese one. I mean, well,
7334000	7336000	there's a lot of strong opinions in our chat room.
7336000	7338000	I'll get to that in a minute, but I got to say like,
7338000	7341000	I wasn't really super on board with PlayStation classics to begin with just
7341000	7343000	because I'm feeling the classic system burnout.
7343000	7347000	Although earlier tonight before our shows went on air,
7347000	7349000	Bobby and I were having a conversation cause we were coordinating the,
7349000	7351000	cause we're doing something special for post-show tonight.
7351000	7354000	So we're coordinating that. But we also kind of talked about, he was like, Hey,
7354000	7357000	Rob, uh, did you know that Commodore 64 mini finally got released, uh,
7357000	7360000	in the U S officially this week? And I was like, Oh yeah, that's the thing.
7360000	7362000	Shit. I kind of want to buy that because I heard about the whole,
7362000	7366000	you can load D four or D 64 images on a USB stick and like play them on the
7366000	7368000	USB mini or on the Commodore 64 mini.
7368000	7371000	So it opens like I could play whatever game I want basically.
7371000	7374000	Cause I mean shit, that system's like 35 years old.
7374000	7376000	I think everybody's given up their copyright on that.
7376000	7380000	That is really the only reason why I want one of these is because that shit is
7380000	7384000	going to be broken up day one and I can put whatever the fuck I want on there.
7384000	7388000	You know, if I want to play driver for example. Well, you know what,
7388000	7391000	actually now that I think of it, why aren't some of these games on there?
7391000	7395000	And actually I'm surprised armored cores on there because that I thought was
7395000	7397000	something that used the dual shock a little bit.
7397000	7399000	Well, so does metal gear solid infamously,
7399000	7402000	but when you put it on the table and it shakes, remember that?
7402000	7405000	But I won't be there. Yeah, they're not going to have that.
7405000	7407000	Obviously they're going to save that for the second one.
7407000	7410000	Yeah, of course they're thinking ahead like that,
7410000	7412000	but I think maybe they're saving too much for the second one.
7412000	7414000	They should have thought ahead and made this one expandable.
7414000	7417000	I thought when we got into the whole fact that this should have just been like
7417000	7420000	a Vita TV loaded with PlayStation games,
7420000	7423000	like I thought that was really honestly the brilliant idea because you download
7423000	7425000	more on the internet, but whatever. It's not going to be that.
7425000	7429000	And I just, I'm a little burned out on the classic systems and I'm,
7429000	7433000	I think it's great that some deep cuts like a super puzzle.
7433000	7437000	Well, really intelligent cube is the deep cut and that's a hard to get.
7437000	7442000	Like stuff like 16 bit and NES games look pretty nice when it's up res
7442000	7446000	and stuff in like, you know, 4k or even just like a 1080 or whatever.
7446000	7449000	PlayStation 1 games, not so much.
7449000	7454000	Low tech, you know, the low quality textures, low poly,
7454000	7461000	not, doesn't age as well as, you know, a 16 bit game that's all sprite based.
7461000	7464000	I mean, it's just, it's not the same.
7464000	7466000	And I think even like with the Nintendo 64,
7466000	7468000	that's going to be kind of cutting it a little bit.
7468000	7471000	I mean, granted, I'd still probably pick it up because I love Nintendo 64 as well,
7471000	7475000	but I hadn't even going back and playing like Ridge Racer type four.
7475000	7478000	It's like, I don't remember it looking this bad.
7478000	7483000	Going to chat, Bobby Blackwolf is talking about the Commodore 64 mini saying
7483000	7485000	it was broken up by the hardware manufacturer.
7485000	7487000	It's not even a third party firmware update.
7487000	7489000	It's a first party firmware update, the official site.
7489000	7491000	I mean, it might be a little less cool for you, but whatevs.
7491000	7492000	Yeah. I mean, important distinction.
7492000	7497000	That Commodore 64 thing is like an official update that's supported by the makers.
7497000	7498000	It's not, it's not cool.
7498000	7500000	They are. Yeah. Which, yeah, I think that is cool.
7500000	7504000	But again, and you can also, I guess I'm going to just talk everything
7504000	7505000	that Bobby and I talked about off air,
7505000	7509000	but Bobby and I were talking about how funny would it be to do a live stream
7509000	7513000	on the VOG channel or something where we type a program in
7513000	7515000	from the back of a magazine live.
7515000	7518000	That would be cool.
7518000	7520000	Why wouldn't that be awesome?
7520000	7521000	I think it would.
7521000	7526000	There is, there is a category on Twitch for computer programming
7526000	7527000	or something like that.
7527000	7529000	So I know there's game development because that's it.
7529000	7531000	That's a game because I try to like, that's the thing is like,
7531000	7533000	you know how they have all those tags and stuff.
7533000	7537000	So I try to tag my stream, my streams I do with some relevant tags,
7537000	7540000	but they're all like for the IRL stuff.
7540000	7545000	So I'm like, well crap, I can't, none of this really applies to what I'm doing.
7545000	7547000	Our chat room is lighting up.
7547000	7551000	And so, you know what, all I'm going to say is this, please look forward to it.
7551000	7553000	I think this is something we're going to have to do.
7553000	7557000	The official typing in, maybe we'll have to do it for charity or something.
7557000	7558000	Let me get a charity thing.
7558000	7559000	Like I'll do it for part of the day.
7559000	7560000	I really want to do like.
7560000	7561000	Bobby can do it.
7561000	7564000	The extra life thing would have been awesome if I got like, you know,
7564000	7565000	a day to myself.
7565000	7567000	I know, I know.
7567000	7569000	Get a set mania machine, put it in there.
7571000	7573000	Dartusia says, make sure you have a USB keyboard.
7573000	7576000	You'll have to use the hunt and peck keyboard and you'll be there all day.
7576000	7580000	Honestly, I feel like it'll go by faster on a real keyboard.
7580000	7582000	Like I know how to type on those now.
7582000	7584000	Like when I was like, cause remember when the Converse 64 was out,
7584000	7586000	I was like six.
7586000	7588000	So I was doing the hunt and peck thing until, you know,
7588000	7592000	I used my typing tutorials, FFFJJ, FFFJJ to learn how to type.
7592000	7593000	But anyway.
7593000	7594000	I never learned how to type.
7594000	7595000	Okay.
7595000	7597000	It wasn't supposed to be about the Commodore 64 mini,
7597000	7600000	although I guess maybe you guys are responding to that more positively.
7600000	7604000	I do want to read some comments about the PlayStation classic mini.
7604000	7607000	SG100 Matt says, some of those games are pretty good.
7607000	7611000	Act Def says, the PlayStation classic sucks, sucks big time.
7611000	7615000	Shane says, this list announcement caused me to cancel my pre-order.
7615000	7619000	Dartusia says, I do appreciate them, including Toshinen and IQ,
7619000	7622000	but a good chunk of those games support the DualShock.
7622000	7624000	Orange Right saying, it's cool to see R4 at least.
7624000	7625000	Yeah.
7625000	7627000	That's R4 is like, but see, that's the thing too.
7627000	7629000	Like R4 is a pretty good game.
7629000	7631000	Cool Wars 2, I think is better than the first one.
7631000	7637000	But like, I guess like with Twisted Metal and stuff that maybe it's because,
7637000	7639000	you know, the other games use the DualShock.
7639000	7642000	Like I would have thought Twisted Metal 2 would have been a better choice.
7642000	7649000	Or like, I don't know, like even with, um, I don't know.
7649000	7650000	Some of these, like I just don't see it.
7650000	7651000	Mr. Driller.
7651000	7654000	Really? Is that like really worth putting in there?
7654000	7655000	I mean, it's an all right game.
7655000	7656000	That game was pretty huge.
7656000	7659000	I think in other areas that weren't necessarily the US.
7659000	7660000	Yeah.
7660000	7661000	Or Grand Theft Auto.
7661000	7665000	I mean, Grant, the original Grand Theft Auto is kind of, it's old.
7665000	7667000	It's so old.
7667000	7668000	I don't remember.
7668000	7669000	I don't remember.
7669000	7670000	Well, Sandra isn't all that.
7670000	7671000	So that was all PlayStation 2.
7671000	7672000	That was the only problem.
7672000	7675000	Well, people are going to think Grand Theft Auto is like,
7675000	7677000	they're going to see that and think, oh,
7677000	7680000	it's like the new ones and then kind of be a little disappointed.
7680000	7683000	No, no, it's not.
7683000	7684000	All right.
7684000	7685000	Well, anyway,
7685000	7688000	let's move on to some other things that were announced at BlizzCon.
7688000	7692000	Again, this is one of those things I'm kind of surprised they didn't do on
7692000	7693000	the main stage.
7693000	7695000	Um, but it was something they kind of, you know,
7695000	7697000	had out there on the show floor, maybe because it was third party.
7697000	7698000	I don't know.
7698000	7700000	Well, I thought they announced this before.
7700000	7704000	I think they announced the partnership between Lego and Overwatch,
7704000	7705000	but we got details.
7705000	7708000	I saw those earlier in the week, but maybe that's just,
7708000	7709000	maybe they leaked out or something.
7709000	7710000	Well, whatever.
7710000	7711000	Anyway.
7711000	7712000	I still want them.
7712000	7714000	Six Overwatch themed building sets.
7714000	7715000	That's the point.
7715000	7717000	With vehicles, characters, and weapons from the game.
7717000	7721000	Starting next year, there's a Tracer versus Widowmaker set,
7721000	7725000	where you can do the drone satellite from Watchpoint Gibraltar.
7725000	7728000	There's a Hanzo versus Genji where you're in the Hanamura dojo.
7728000	7729000	That's pretty cool.
7729000	7732000	Dorado Showdown will be Soldier 76, Reaper,
7732000	7734000	and McCree in buildings from the Dorado map.
7734000	7737000	And there's a D.Va and Reinhardt set with a buildable mech suit
7737000	7741000	and a powered armor that the heroes will bring into battle.
7741000	7742000	So it's kind of like, you know,
7742000	7745000	their characters are much more involved because you build the whole mech
7745000	7747000	and then you build the whole Reinhardt shield and all that.
7747000	7748000	So that's pretty cool.
7748000	7751000	There's a Bastion set with a buildable version of the character
7751000	7754000	and you can do both recon mode and sentry mode
7754000	7755000	because Legos, you can change it.
7755000	7756000	So that's kind of fun.
7756000	7761000	There is a 730 piece Watchpoint Gibraltar set
7761000	7764000	with Mercy, Reaper, Winston, and Pharah.
7764000	7767000	These sets will start at $14.99,
7767000	7770000	which is probably for that smaller, maybe the Hanamura set,
7770000	7775000	and go all the way up to $90 probably for that Watchpoint Gibraltar
7775000	7776000	because Legos ain't cheap.
7776000	7780000	So anyway, you can start getting these on January 1st, 2019.
7780000	7781000	Actually, you can start getting them now
7782000	7787000	because they have that one Bastion set.
7787000	7789000	It was the alternate skin or whatever
7789000	7791000	that you can actually get through the Blizzard store.
7791000	7793000	You can get that now.
7793000	7794000	That's cool.
7794000	7796000	I wonder if my, since my husband likes Overwatch so much,
7796000	7799000	I wonder if he would want me to spend all that money on Overwatch Legos.
7799000	7801000	I don't know.
7801000	7803000	He's making an ahh noise from the other room.
7803000	7807000	Act Def does say in chat over at live.vognetware.com
7807000	7809000	$90 is kind of too much.
7810000	7812000	Have you looked at Legos lately?
7812000	7815000	You must not shop for Legos often.
7815000	7817000	It's a good thing it's not Star Wars.
7817000	7818000	Yeah, right.
7818000	7821000	Anyway, a few more stories before we get to the Skype line
7821000	7822000	at Orange Launch Radio.
7822000	7823000	Loki.
7823000	7826000	Their stupid $799 Millennium Falcon.
7826000	7829000	Yeah, they can shove that $799 up their ass
7829000	7831000	because I ain't never gonna pay that.
7831000	7836000	So anyways, talking about classic collections.
7836000	7841000	Sega Genesis classics are gonna be coming to Nintendo Switch in December.
7841000	7846000	And you're gonna get 50 classic Sega Mega Drive and Genesis titles.
7846000	7848000	And there's a lot.
7848000	7850000	And I'm not gonna read all of them, but I'll read some of them
7850000	7852000	that I think that you might like.
7852000	7856000	So for example, let's talk about Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle.
7856000	7858000	Or we have Alien Storm.
7858000	7860000	Or Altered Beasts.
7860000	7862000	Columns.
7862000	7864000	Comic Zone.
7864000	7868000	Of course, Golden Axe, Golden Axe 2, Golden Axe 3.
7868000	7871000	Fantasy Star 2, 3, and 4.
7871000	7873000	Shining Force 1 and 2.
7873000	7876000	Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, 3D Blast.
7876000	7878000	Street Rage 1, 2, and 3.
7878000	7881000	Toejam and Earl 1 and 2.
7881000	7883000	Vector Man, Vector Man 2.
7883000	7887000	And Virtual Fighter 2, among lots of other games.
7887000	7891000	Most of the same shit Sega's released over and over again over the years.
7891000	7893000	Although, I feel like they don't do Alex Kidd stuff enough.
7893000	7895000	So I'm happy to hear that's coming back.
7895000	7900000	But it's gonna be on the Switch because, you know, that's December 7th.
7900000	7903000	And because, of course, they're not doing Virtual Console anymore,
7903000	7905000	so this is why it's all in the collection.
7905000	7907000	Which, actually, probably for the money, you're gonna get a better deal
7907000	7909000	than if you bought those all separately on Virtual Console.
7909000	7911000	Oh, for sure.
7911000	7914000	Now that I think about it, since I brought up Alex Kidd,
7914000	7916000	why does the Sega bring that kid back?
7916000	7919000	It seems like one of those old franchises that's really due for a reboot
7919000	7921000	that, for whatever reason, has never happened. That's weird.
7921000	7923000	Is it because Sonic kind of took over all their platforming,
7923000	7925000	so they have that tunnel vision?
7925000	7928000	And that's all they want to release when it comes to platforming is Sonic?
7928000	7929000	I'd love to see a new Alex Kidd game.
7929000	7931000	No, Alex Kidd doesn't have enough stupid friends to bring along for the ride.
7931000	7933000	Well, invent some.
7933000	7936000	Alex Kidd in Shinobi World, you know, all that.
7936000	7939000	Maybe Alex Kidd can get introduced as one of Sonic's friends,
7939000	7941000	and then we'll spin it off into it.
7941000	7943000	Well, and I'm sure somebody in chat's gonna have already said this,
7943000	7946000	but Alex Kidd was in the Sega All-Stars racing game.
7947000	7949000	The one with Danica Patrick.
7949000	7951000	Oh yeah, that new one's supposed to be coming out.
7951000	7952000	I got him delayed, remember?
7952000	7953000	At some point.
7953000	7956000	Yeah, I got pushed back a little bit, so I think that was a couple weeks ago,
7956000	7958000	we talked about that, so.
7958000	7960000	Anyway, something else you can look forward to,
7960000	7962000	and I'm sure you will be looking forward to this,
7962000	7964000	a brand new Bubsy game.
7964000	7965000	I can't even say his name right.
7965000	7966000	Fuck that shit.
7966000	7967000	Bubsy.
7968000	7970000	It's Bubsy, that's right.
7970000	7972000	Aren't you excited that there's a new Bubsy game coming out?
7972000	7975000	No, I'm not. He's an obnoxious piece of shit.
7976000	7981000	Bubsy Paws on Fire will be coming out for PC, PlayStation 4, and Switch.
7982000	7983000	Who wanted this?
7983000	7985000	Who wanted Bubsy?
7985000	7987000	Nobody fucking wants Bubsy.
7987000	7989000	Apparently people bought the stupid Bubsy game,
7989000	7991000	because otherwise they wouldn't be making another Bubsy game.
7991000	7994000	Well, Bubsy will be bringing along three of his shitty friends
7994000	7996000	for four playable characters,
7996000	7998000	that each one has their own unique play style,
7998000	8000000	according to the press release.
8000000	8002000	Oh wow, that's so 2019 or 18.
8003000	8006000	New moves never before seen in a Bubsy title.
8007000	8009000	And over 100 levels.
8009000	8011000	And they say, I love this, this is in the press release,
8012000	8017000	Paws on Fire is a game for Bubsy lovers and haters alike.
8018000	8020000	No, if I hate it, I'm not buying it.
8022000	8024000	I love it. I loved it in the press release.
8024000	8026000	This one's for my haters.
8026000	8027000	This goes out to my haters.
8027000	8030000	You know what, if you're gonna bring back old-ass platformer games,
8030000	8033000	then I want a fucking new Gex game, god damn it.
8034000	8036000	Gex deserves another game.
8036000	8038000	Now, Akdeft in chat points out the only good thing about this
8038000	8042000	is that it's made by the people from the Bit.Trip Runner series.
8042000	8044000	It does look like this is a runner game,
8044000	8046000	which is how they made 100-plus levels.
8046000	8048000	It looks like it might be a runner title.
8048000	8050000	Which, you know, low-key, before I know you,
8050000	8052000	I feel the judgment coming off of you,
8052000	8055000	but those Bit.Trip Runner games are pretty fucking good, I gotta say.
8055000	8058000	So, I mean, if they're just slapping Bubsy onto that,
8058000	8059000	I mean, downright-
8059000	8060000	Do you know why they're good?
8060000	8062000	Because Bubsy is not fucking in those games.
8062000	8064000	That's why they're good.
8064000	8066000	Nobody said, hey, you know what?
8066000	8068000	These runner games, they need more Bubsy.
8068000	8070000	Rageinator in chat says,
8070000	8073000	new moves never seen before in a Bubsy game.
8073000	8075000	Does that feature make it fun?
8076000	8077000	Is Shane still listening?
8077000	8079000	Shane, if you're listening, I got a question for you.
8079000	8081000	Which was worse?
8081000	8085000	The Quiet Man or Bubsy 3D?
8086000	8087000	What do you think, Logie?
8087000	8088000	Which one's worse, the Quiet Man?
8088000	8090000	Which would you rather be forced to play for an hour?
8090000	8092000	The Quiet Man or Bubsy 3D?
8092000	8093000	Bubsy 3D.
8097000	8100000	Shane confirming in chat that the Quiet Man was the worst game.
8100000	8101000	Exactly.
8101000	8103000	So, Bubsy, you got that.
8103000	8105000	At least you're not the Quiet Man.
8106000	8108000	Avant-garde Bubsy.
8108000	8109000	Yeah, that's all I need to say.
8109000	8112000	And the trick in Bubsy is that there's no sound.
8112000	8113000	Whatsoever.
8114000	8116000	Anyway, just a couple more stories for you guys,
8116000	8120000	and then we'll take your loud phone calls over on Skype at Orange Launch Radio.
8120000	8121000	Logie?
8121000	8123000	So, it's that time.
8123000	8127000	The time when all of your modern systems get emulated.
8127000	8130000	And what system is next on the list?
8130000	8133000	Why, of course, it's a Nintendo Switch.
8133000	8137000	So apparently there's this emulator called the Yuzu emulator
8137000	8141000	that has managed to run Super Mario Odyssey
8141000	8144000	completely through the whole game.
8144000	8146000	So, it does work in the emulator.
8146000	8150000	Granted, there are some graphical glitches and some slowdowns,
8150000	8153000	but it is playable, and you can play from the beginning to the end.
8153000	8157000	And they even have a way where you can download the patches and everything.
8157000	8163000	So, pretty far progress considering that this is the first I'm hearing of it.
8164000	8168000	So, I'm definitely on board with seeing what they're gonna do with this.
8168000	8170000	Of course, no good things, obviously.
8170000	8171000	It's gonna be modded like crazy.
8171000	8174000	Balzette's gonna be in here in like a matter of time.
8174000	8177000	Just matter of...
8178000	8180000	Just gotta wait.
8182000	8183000	The TTB.
8183000	8184000	Joy.
8185000	8188000	Did you hear that Nintendo confirmed this week, by the way,
8188000	8191000	that that hat can't be used on any other characters?
8191000	8194000	It can only be used on Toadette.
8194000	8196000	Or, what is it? No.
8196000	8198000	Yeah, the hat is only used on Toadette to make Peach Hat.
8198000	8200000	You can't use it on other characters.
8200000	8204000	So, just so you know, everybody, Nintendo has officially confirmed
8204000	8206000	Balzette is not canon.
8206000	8208000	So, please remove her from the internet now.
8208000	8209000	You were wrong.
8209000	8212000	And I am going to point out why you're wrong.
8212000	8218000	Because in an official art book for Super Mario Odyssey,
8218000	8223000	Nintendo actually, before the internet came up with Balzette,
8223000	8225000	came up with Balzette.
8225000	8227000	It's already a thing. It's already canon.
8227000	8228000	It's already canon.
8228000	8232000	Yes, but then it was deleted as all of your accounts ought to be.
8232000	8234000	Just saying.
8235000	8237000	Dartetsuya in chat says,
8237000	8239000	Switch emulators already?
8239000	8242000	I mean, I guess I'm not surprised, but I'll stick with my official hardware.
8242000	8244000	Yeah, it could be risky.
8244000	8246000	Probably gonna be very buggy, too.
8246000	8249000	And Rama in chat, in reference to my Balzette hating, says,
8249000	8252000	Dear Rob Roberts, we will reject your false notions.
8252000	8254000	I don't know, though.
8254000	8257000	Honestly, though, the emulators that run Wii U games and stuff
8257000	8259000	run them better than the Wii U.
8259000	8264000	I can't see that this wouldn't be that difficult to...
8264000	8267000	I mean, yeah, it's probably not running great right now
8267000	8269000	because they haven't optimized a ton of stuff.
8269000	8272000	But it will get there, I think.
8272000	8277000	And then we'll have 4K Mario Odyssey and modded craziness.
8278000	8280000	Alright, well, one more story for you guys.
8280000	8282000	And chatters behave. Stop dragging me.
8282000	8285000	Because this is a serious one to end on, this note tonight.
8285000	8287000	The inspiration, or I should say the namesake,
8287000	8289000	maybe not totally the inspiration,
8289000	8291000	but the namesake for Nintendo's Mario character
8291000	8294000	actually passed away this week at the age of 84.
8294000	8297000	Mario Segal? I hope I said that name right.
8297000	8300000	S-E-G-A-L-E? Segal?
8300000	8304000	Mario Segal actually passed away this week, again, at the age of 84.
8304000	8306000	Passed away on October 27th.
8306000	8308000	Who was he? He was not a plumber.
8308000	8311000	He developed office buildings and malls in Washington state.
8311000	8314000	He actually sold this all in 1998 for about 60 million.
8314000	8319000	In the year 1981, he was renting a warehouse to Nintendo of America.
8319000	8321000	And Miyamoto created the Mario character,
8321000	8324000	but of course originally the name of the character was Jumpman.
8324000	8326000	And then the girlfriend was Lady.
8326000	8328000	Well, at some point, Nintendo wanted proper names,
8328000	8333000	so they named the hero Mario after this landlord.
8333000	8338000	And then Pauline was actually named after a wife of a Nintendo of America employee.
8338000	8340000	So that is where the name came from.
8340000	8342000	Believe it or not.
8342000	8345000	He apparently rejected his connection to the Mario franchise
8345000	8348000	because he thought it might harm his business ventures.
8348000	8351000	In a 1993 interview with the Seattle Times, he just said,
8351000	8355000	you might say I'm still waiting for my royalty checks.
8355000	8359000	Regardless, it sounds like Mario may not have been named Mario
8359000	8363000	if it wasn't for him, so whether he likes it or not,
8363000	8366000	I suppose he's forever a part of that video game canon.
8366000	8369000	But interesting to know that Mario, the name,
8369000	8371000	had nothing to do with a plumber or any of that other stuff
8371000	8375000	that goes with the lore behind the Mario character.
8375000	8378000	In chat at live.vognetwork.com, D'Artesia says,
8378000	8382000	I mean, just think about different things would be if it weren't for him.
8382000	8385000	That's right. I mean, if the real estate developer had been named something else
8385000	8389000	or they decided to name it after another character, I mean, Mario is iconic.
8389000	8392000	Mario is a Mickey Mouse for this generation.
8392000	8394000	Like, everybody knows Mario.
8394000	8397000	If you're, you know, under a certain age, even if you're over a certain age,
8397000	8399000	you still probably know who Mario is.
8399000	8404000	S200Matt says, this is like Spielberg naming the shark in Jaws Bruce
8404000	8408000	after his lawyer. I'm not so sure that was a compliment, though.
8408000	8411000	Tigerclaw wants to know, where did the name Luigi come from?
8411000	8414000	Good question. It wasn't really addressed in the Mario story,
8414000	8417000	so I'm not sure where Luigi came from, but I'm sure,
8417000	8419000	got to be out there on the internet somewhere.
8419000	8421000	If you can weed your way through all the Bowsette photos,
8421000	8423000	you can probably figure out where that came from.
8423000	8424000	I'm pretty curious, too.
8424000	8427000	Dark Tetsuya says, oh, check out the brain on Dark Tetsuya.
8427000	8432000	Dark Tetsuya says, his name is a Japanese pun on the word for similar,
8432000	8435000	since he's similar to Mario's sprite in Mario Brothers.
8435000	8439000	Clever. And if you think about it, Luigi wasn't in Donkey Kong.
8439000	8441000	They didn't have to name him when they named Mario,
8441000	8445000	so he was named later, probably when they did the Mario Brothers game,
8445000	8447000	which would have been after Donkey Kong,
8447000	8451000	because there was no Luigi in Donkey Kong, so food for thought.
8451000	8453000	Anyway, our Skype line is open, if you want to give us a call.
8453000	8457000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, to give us a call on Skype for the night,
8457000	8459000	and we can talk about Diablo, I guess.
8459000	8462000	If you want to talk about Bowsette, we can, although I'd rather not.
8462000	8464000	We can talk about whatever you want over at Orange Lounge Radio,
8464000	8466000	all one word on Skype.
8466000	8470000	While we wait for our phone to ring, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?
8470000	8475000	Yeah, so the Nintendo Switch has reached 22.86 million units sold
8475000	8479000	that's surpassing the GameCube lifetime sales,
8479000	8482000	so that's pretty good in comparison, of course.
8482000	8491000	The 3DS is 73.5 million units, and the Wii U 13.56 million units.
8491000	8494000	We have a call coming in. Let's get to it.
8494000	8496000	I'm going to pick up the phone here.
8496000	8499000	By the way, we did get a reprieve on the Skype thing.
8499000	8501000	Skype is still working on Windows XP.
8501000	8506000	I guess Microsoft pushed back the time to pull the plug for whatever reason.
8506000	8507000	Anyway, I think we are there.
8507000	8509000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8511000	8513000	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8515000	8517000	Not working. Try calling without the video.
8517000	8519000	I think the video is slowing you down.
8519000	8521000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8521000	8523000	Sorry about that, Loki. Do you have something else to put in there?
8523000	8527000	Speaking of numbers, PlayStation 4 shipped 86.1 million units worldwide.
8529000	8531000	That's a lot of PlayStations.
8531000	8533000	That is a lot of PlayStation, yeah.
8534000	8541000	Their gaming revenue is up 27%. Profit up 65%, so don't let them tell you that they don't have enough money.
8541000	8543000	Because they are making plenty of it.
8543000	8545000	Alright, I'm going to try this call again and see if it comes through.
8545000	8547000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8548000	8551000	Hi, this is Rachael. Sorry about that.
8551000	8553000	I have connection problems over on my end.
8553000	8555000	Apparently. That's alright, though. We got you now.
8555000	8557000	What's up, buddy? What's on your mind tonight?
8557000	8563000	Yeah, well, granted, I'm a little late to the show. Sorry about that. I had all the commitments, but...
8563000	8565000	I see how it is.
8565000	8569000	Yeah, well, sometimes real life happens. But seriously, though...
8569000	8571000	We are your life now.
8573000	8579000	Well, I could say something, but I'm trying to keep this radio appropriate.
8579000	8581000	Yeah, good idea. Good idea.
8581000	8583000	Yeah, good idea.
8583000	8585000	But seriously, though...
8587000	8595000	Since you were talking about the PlayStation Classic that will be coming out this holiday...
8597000	8599000	I have a question for you.
8599000	8605000	Do you see yourself picking this up, or do you see yourself passing it out?
8605000	8611000	And whatever your answer is, please explain either way.
8611000	8615000	Yes, sir. I think I did kind of mention it earlier, but I'll just reiterate.
8615000	8621000	My plan is to pass on this, and the reason why is that I'm a little burned out on all the classic consoles.
8621000	8629000	I think it's a little ridiculous that the PlayStation 4 just won't play the PlayStation 1 games that I still have in the case, ready to go, to play on it.
8629000	8635000	And I realize something can be said about, you know, well, then why would you buy an NES Classic when you have Nintendo games?
8635000	8643000	Which, I mean, I suppose is fair, but at the same time, those, you know, at that time, to buy the little NES Classic, the SNES Classic, those were super cute as well.
8643000	8651000	And I'm not saying the PlayStation Classic isn't cute, but they did make some questionable design choices, such as omitting the DualShock, such as charging $100 for 20 games.
8651000	8656000	Sorry, but I don't think these games are worth that price tag that they're putting out.
8656000	8661000	So, kind of all those things together does it in for me. But you know what I did pay money for? I should point this out.
8661000	8670000	So, my little collection that I have of these classic arcade games, right? I picked up this BurgerTime one. I mentioned that a couple weeks ago, because that's like a fancier one, right?
8670000	8678000	I picked up two brand new ones at $35 a pop. I just haven't put them out yet. I wonder if Alan just went in the other room and grabbed them. I don't know.
8678000	8688000	Oh, yes, he did. He's bringing them in the studio now. So, the two new ones I just bought this week and were Mappy, which I thought was pretty cool, that there's one for that, and Dig Dug.
8688000	8702000	Dig Dug is kind of that 80s game that I'm actually okay at. I can actually play it quite a bit. So, Alan wants to give some input on all of this. Apparently, my classic gaming collection hobby. Yes, Alan?
8702000	8708000	The one thing that I dislike about the new series is that they're slightly bigger than the series one and two, so they don't look like they belong.
8708000	8713000	They're different companies. They're not the same. Like, they're not the same companies making them. So, that's why.
8713000	8714000	I retract my statement.
8714000	8723000	Okay. Oh, wait, wait. Before you run away. Before you run away, why don't you answer our caller's question? Would you buy the PlayStation Classic for $100? Why or why not?
8723000	8728000	I would. Just, I mean, I would.
8728000	8730000	No, you will not.
8730000	8740000	I would need a lot of, like, a windfall of money where I would buy something that frivolous, but I'm not, like, offended by what the plan is or what the games are on it or anything.
8740000	8744000	Okay. All right. Loki, what's your perspective on that? Thanks for stopping by. Loki?
8744000	8756000	I don't know if I have an extra $100 to dump on that, and also besides, I, like, I bought, well, first off, I bought a Coleco, a ColecoVision, one of the plug and play classic things. I haven't used it.
8756000	8768000	I bought an SNES classic. I've hardly used it. So, buying this again would be, like, I probably won't use it. That's why I probably wouldn't buy one. I do want one so it can hack it, but that's about all I want.
8768000	8776000	Interesting verbiage from Bobby Blackwolf in our chat who says, I'm skipping on the PlayStation Classic because I don't have the emotional connection to the system.
8776000	8783000	Right, and that's the other thing, too. It's, like, honestly, like, it's really easy to emulate PlayStation 1 games. You can do it, and it will look-
8783000	8785000	It's easier to emulate NES games.
8785000	8787000	It's incredibly easy, yes.
8787000	8794000	But yet, I don't know. I don't know. Well, RageNator, do we give you what you were looking for? What's your opinion on it all?
8794000	8813000	Yeah, well, I'm tempted to give one, you know, because I do have the emotional connection. I did have PlayStation 1 way back in the day. In fact, you know, I got mine back in April of 97, you know, a couple weeks after I got N64.
8813000	8826000	And a lot of the games that you listed, I do have played, you know, some I haven't played, so there's that. You know, I at least want to try them at least once, at least the ones I haven't played.
8826000	8840000	However, the key thing is, now this is coming out holiday time. You mentioned there's a $100 purchase, not including sales tax. And my budget for Christmas is extremely limited.
8840000	8841000	Sure.
8841000	8861000	I'm just barely able to save up $200 for Christmas, and every single last cent is already spoken for in terms of buying Christmas presents. In fact, one of which is going to cost me like $120. So that's a lot of money that's being spent on Christmas presents.
8861000	8863000	Well, someone's getting spoiled.
8863000	8867000	Yeah, I'm not saying who, and-
8867000	8869000	And in our business, it's fine.
8869000	8883000	Yeah, and what the present is, that's $120, because that kind of thing is kind of inappropriate to mention on stream, but it's, let's just say it's one of those gifts.
8883000	8886000	Alright, okay.
8886000	8892000	Yeah, I know no one else can see me but Rob, but I'm using air quotes around those gifts.
8892000	8894000	I'm looking away right now.
8894000	8900000	Yeah, so you can probably use your imagination right there.
8900000	8908000	No, I won't be using my imagination on that whatsoever. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners, Rageator, before I let you go?
8908000	8914000	Nah, I'm all set, but thanks for taking my call.
8914000	8915000	Hey, you're welcome.
8915000	8922000	I'll try to catch your next show and Bobby's show next week, and it's entirely assuming that the real-life plans don't happen.
8922000	8928000	Well, there's always the podcast, that's what it's for, so you can listen to it when it's convenient for you and your busy life.
8928000	8931000	Yeah, well, have a nice night.
8931000	8932000	You too, take care, buddy.
8932000	8939000	Alright, Skype's lighting up tonight, we gotta get to another call here, so I'm gonna pick up another call on the line and get to it.
8939000	8941000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8941000	8945000	Ah, excellent, this is Zormay. How are you guys doing?
8945000	8948000	Hi, are you a first-time caller? I don't recognize the name.
8948000	8953000	No, it's not. Sky, I spoke a few times over the last ten years.
8953000	8958000	Okay, so it's just a long-time dormant, we'll say then.
8958000	8965000	I mean, sort of. I do have been able to keep up with you guys because of Twitter and Facebook.
8965000	8971000	I actually remembered that you guys were on because you tweeted about it, and I'm actively on Twitter myself.
8971000	8977000	Hooray, social networking works! Yay! Pipping my shit on social media all the time. Awesome.
8977000	8978000	Great.
8978000	8983000	Oh, you're right, I do recognize the name. Bobby had to spell it out for me in chat. I do remember your name, I sure do.
8983000	8986000	So, what's on your mind? What do we owe the phone call to tonight?
8986000	8996000	Actually, you know, I'm just really happy to see you guys still on the air and talking about the things that you love, and I enjoy it.
8996000	9002000	I'm a big DDR fan, I actually am in the process of trying to get myself my own machine.
9002000	9003000	Oh!
9003000	9004000	Yeah.
9004000	9006000	Now you know that's something Loki recently did.
9006000	9017000	You see, that's the whole thing. I wish that if Loki could probably give me any pointers on picking out one and keeping up with it, I'm really looking for that.
9017000	9022000	Well, Loki, how did you find your machine? What's the upkeep been like for you?
9022000	9036000	I just kept checking different places, like eBay, there's a buy-sell-trade Facebook group that you can become a part of that sometimes people will sell machines.
9036000	9050000	Craigslist, I got lucky with Facebook Marketplace, someone just was dumping a machine, the guy was a collector and he didn't really play DDR too much, he just wanted to get rid of the machine, so I got it really cheap.
9050000	9058000	And because he was trying to clear it out to me, because he's like, to be honest, I just want to get rid of this so I can get four more machines that can fit in the space that this one machine was in.
9058000	9064000	Because he had like three rooms in his house in the garage that was also full of arcade games.
9064000	9067000	So he was getting rid of that in like a Gauntlet Legends, which is like, ooh, Gauntlet.
9067000	9074000	But that's how I got lucky there. And as far as upkeep, really all I've done is like cleaned the pads.
9075000	9086000	I lucked out, I don't know if it's lucky or not, but like I have it, it's an LCD screen in there, so it's like an LCD TV and not the original CRT screens, so I know there's a lot more upkeep with those.
9086000	9097000	Granted, the images stretch a little bit, but that's not going to be a problem when I put StepMania in there at some point or if I manage to hack in one of the newer arcade games.
9097000	9105000	But as far as like the upkeep and stuff, it's like I did go through and clean the pads out because they were pretty dirty.
9105000	9110000	Apparently the machine had come from the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk at some point.
9110000	9116000	I was trying to find like old video to see if I could find where it was, but that's where they claim it came from.
9116000	9125000	It was a third Korean at some point and got upgraded to an Extreme. And so it was dirty. It had lots of beach sand in there.
9125000	9131000	And so I've cleaned out one side of the pads. I didn't clean out the other side yet, which I probably should do.
9131000	9134000	Well, if you're going to be inviting me over, you better clean that up.
9134000	9139000	Well, the only reason I could clean out the first side, because the first side was missing like crazy. The second side played just fine.
9139000	9144000	So I was like, oh, I'm just going to clean out this one side and it's never got around to doing the other one.
9144000	9158000	I also need to get surface mount screws on there so that everything's inset and not sticking out, because I trip myself on those screws quite often.
9158000	9160000	Ah, that could be painful.
9160000	9164000	So can you remind me again, what mix did you have? You have Extreme, right?
9164000	9166000	I have Extreme, yeah.
9166000	9172000	OK. And I'm pretty sure you actually have it shipped from California. So I'm on the East Coast.
9172000	9179000	Well, I lucked out. I didn't have to ship it. The guy was local to me. He was like maybe 10 minutes away.
9179000	9183000	So I just grabbed the U-Haul and I had a couple of friends help me get in there.
9183000	9188000	So I got really lucky when I didn't have it shipped because shipping would be pretty expensive.
9188000	9196000	But yeah, I kind of lucked out. It's hard to find new machines out there.
9196000	9203000	I mean, honestly, like I was almost going to build my own because it might end up being cheaper that route.
9203000	9211000	But I don't know. You can do like even like if you get like, well, the step mania step maniacs pads are pretty expensive.
9211000	9218000	Like I think they're a thousand bucks or something. But wow. You can if if you're willing to pay that, you can just get a LCD TV and mount it.
9218000	9220000	And then that's about the machine right there.
9220000	9226000	OK. I've seen some because I actually use the Sows Network, the money.
9226000	9236000	So you guys know about that. But, you know, on there, they told me that there's actually a possibly get newer versions like we can get like to DDR 2014.
9236000	9244000	And, you know, and there's a guy that talks about how he can help me set it up. But it's just like it's a hit or miss about the newer ones.
9244000	9249000	And they have a lot of older ones, like five hundred, six hundred dollars roughly about the extreme.
9249000	9254000	And they just said that you might have to fix it. And I don't know too much about like going into it, fixing it.
9254000	9259000	Like I have the the private server, you know, to kind of play beat mania.
9259000	9268000	I have like the program world. But over here, you know, by Chinatown Fair, they actually had the people who actually installed it in the machines over there.
9268000	9272000	So but like getting the machine as I'm thinking about shipping.
9272000	9279000	So I'm glad that you let me know a little bit about that. I'll see what how it is on the East Coast.
9279000	9285000	Shipping is probably going to be a few hundred dollars just because they have to pallet it and everything.
9285000	9292000	I mean, the machines themselves, they're not too heavy because they're on wheels for the most part.
9292000	9299000	I mean, so it was pretty it was pretty easy just to get it in and out of U-Haul for me.
9299000	9306000	I mean, well, my actual my plan is I don't know about over on the West Coast, but well, it is over there as well.
9306000	9313000	But you've heard of like TaskRabbit. Yeah, I think I've heard of it.
9313000	9320000	Yeah. So there's like a way you can people you just hire people on demand and they'll help you move things and fix stuff and and whatnot.
9320000	9329000	So that's my actual plan for the lifting because I have to live on the second floor in like in Brooklyn here in New York.
9329000	9334000	So that's like one of the things I'm really interested in because I can at least get the help for that.
9334000	9340000	But the actual fixing of it or maybe I was like I was hoping that maybe there was some sort of like I know there's a wiki out there somewhere.
9340000	9346000	But, you know, it's making sure they're up to date and dated. You know, I might I'm a fan extreme.
9346000	9351000	I might just do extreme. So but I think that's that's all. That's all I basically thanks a lot for that.
9351000	9357000	No worries, buddy. And it's good to hear from you. And best of luck in your hunt to chase down a DDR machine.
9357000	9364000	And I hope when you get one that you don't, you know, ruin your relationship with your downstairs neighbors.
9364000	9369000	You may want to talk to you may want to talk to Rama in our chat room because he says, yo, I know people in Brooklyn.
9369000	9375000	So, oh, yeah, I definitely will. I'll hit up the chat. All right.
9375000	9379000	Sounds good. Well, take care, my friend. Thanks for the call. All right. Take care. Yep. Bye bye.
9379000	9387000	Orange launch radio, all one word on Skype. We can probably squeeze in one more call before we call the night here at Orange launch radio.
9387000	9393000	So get those phones ringing. Did you have any other last minute stories you want to sneak in here? Yeah, this is kind of interesting.
9393000	9399000	I completely forgot this is coming up, but apparently this coming up weekend is inside Xbox XO 18.
9399000	9404000	Oh, yeah. Isn't that like in Mexico City or something? I believe so. Yeah. So that's going to be coming up this weekend.
9404000	9410000	So I guess we'll have some news. They say they run three to five p.m. central time.
9410000	9417000	They're going to have this inside Xbox. It's going to be taking place at 18 central time on Saturday.
9417000	9422000	So three to five central. So I have to check it out and see what they're going to announce.
9422000	9429000	Do you think? Yeah, I was going to say, do you think they're going to be any big announcements or do you think Xbox classic?
9429000	9436000	That would be weird. I mean, neat. But yeah, I don't think they would do that because they have backwards compatibility.
9436000	9441000	They're not stupid like some of the other. Yeah. All right. All right.
9441000	9445000	Well, let's get one more call in here. And I'm sorry to those that aren't going to get through tonight.
9445000	9449000	But, you know, you can always email us. Hi, you're on Orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on?
9449000	9457000	It is Ron. Hey, Ron. What's on your mind, buddy? Not too much. I guess I do have like the quick trigger finger to get onto the Skype line.
9457000	9462000	Yes. Yes. You beat out thousands of others to get through once again. I'm just kidding. What's on your mind, though?
9462000	9470000	Couple of things. Number one. Yeah, I'm still waiting on Sony to announce backwards compatibility of PS one and PS two games in the PlayStation.
9470000	9479000	Don't hold your breath. Yeah, keep it. I know. I know. But I'm finally going to get one because Target's going to have the one terabyte console for 200 bucks.
9479000	9486000	Hmm. OK, so because, you know, Black Friday deals are leaking left and right. And I said that's the only way I'm getting next gen consoles.
9486000	9492000	If they're 200 bucks on Black Friday and I'm glad I got my Xbox one last year. Yeah, that is a pretty darn good deal.
9492000	9506000	I got to say. So don't blame me there. And the second thing, I know you hate this whole Bowser thing, but you got this.
9506000	9515000	I have this amazing cosplay group I'm putting together for a con next year. I'm going to tell you and I think you're going to like it.
9515000	9522000	I can't wait to not see pictures. No, I'm just kidding. What is it? Oh, we're going to be doing selfies on the mixture. I send them to you.
9522000	9530000	Oh, boy. All right. So we're going to have to my friends are twins are going to be Bowser and booing.
9530000	9539000	And through some convincing, I am doing a modification of a Ghostbusters jumpsuit as Luigi.
9539000	9544000	OK, so you will be trapping Boozette live during the convention?
9544000	9554000	Probably so. And we're going to play off the supposed quote unquote relationship between Buette and Luigi, because what I see is this.
9554000	9560000	Buette sees Luigi as her boyfriend and Luigi has no fucking clue as to this.
9560000	9566000	You cosplayers have so much fucking time on your hands to invent these stories. All of this shipping going on.
9566000	9569000	Nothing but love. Nothing but love. I'm just being a bitch.
9569000	9573000	Oh, you should see the Gundam Wing fandom. That's a story for another time.
9573000	9579000	Bobby Black Wolf suggests to do Pea Chowser, not Bowsette. And then that way you trick me.
9579000	9586000	Well, only half my cosplay friends. That could happen. But I talked to Mako Char.
9586000	9593000	She's going to join in. She's going into a variant of Daisy based off of Janine Melanin from the animated series.
9593000	9600000	Now, see, when you told me that I would be into it, I thought you'd be like, I know all these like shirtless gay dudes who are going to be doing like Bowsette.
9600000	9604000	But like as male without shirts on, I'd be like, OK, well, you can send me that.
9604000	9609000	I do have a dude dressed up as Bowsette I saw over the weekend. I can send you pictures of that.
9609000	9615000	All right. We got my number. Area code 916. I'm just going to give my phone number out on her.
9615000	9620000	I also have some shirtless cross play Sailor Moon dudes for you as well.
9620000	9624000	All right. Well, that's right of Allen's alley. Allen loves Sailor Moon.
9624000	9629000	Someone needs the cosplay Bowsette, but the Dennis Hopper Bowser.
9630000	9635000	See that I might have to get someone to do that as well. Now, that's funny.
9635000	9640000	By the way, since since Rama brought up Ghostbusters, I forgot to say, you know, they have that Ghostbusters game.
9640000	9644000	That's kind of like the takeoff on Pokemon Go that came out. I played that a little bit this week.
9644000	9648000	It uses the AR stuff like you have to like put a trap on the ground.
9648000	9652000	It doesn't it's not like throwing a ball. They didn't try to copy that thing for Pokemon Go.
9652000	9656000	So they made like a whole different type of capture thing with the Ghostbusters thing.
9656000	9660000	So I thought Rama reminded me of that. I did play that because, you know what, Loki?
9660000	9666000	Once in a while, I'll just try a mobile game that sounds remotely interesting because it's free.
9666000	9670000	And because you have a phone. Because I have a phone. Don't you have a phone?
9670000	9672000	I do have a phone.
9672000	9676000	That's it. Thank you, Tigerclaw. Ghostbusters World. That's the name of it.
9676000	9681000	Don't you have a phone, Rama? I haven't heard it yet. Don't you have a phone?
9682000	9683000	Yes, I have a phone.
9683000	9686000	I know. I'm just saying. It's the question we're all asking each other this week.
9686000	9691000	I just upgraded my phone so now I can actually download and play more games.
9691000	9692000	Oh, there you go.
9692000	9697000	I have about 20 games on my phone and I sit there, I play Sailor Moon and drops all damn day.
9697000	9701000	You and my husband both. Jesus. All right.
9701000	9706000	Well, Rama, I'm going to wrap up and let you go. But any other quick final thoughts for our listeners?
9706000	9713000	I agree with Bobby Blackwolf about the retro consoles. I mean, honestly, I'm not buying into the PlayStation Classic.
9713000	9722000	I can't see myself doing it. I mean, honestly, I'd rather track down a PS1, mod it, download the iCells and play it.
9722000	9726000	And that will probably be a lot cheaper than buying a classic. Just saying.
9726000	9731000	Yeah, I know. Well, you know, Sony would prefer you didn't do it that way.
9731000	9735000	But then, you know what? As far as I'm concerned, Sony could have released those things on PlayStation 4.
9735000	9738000	Let me use my PlayStation 1 disc. It's getting a little silly.
9738000	9743000	Yes. I mean, Microsoft lets you. Come on, Sony. Who are you kidding, fam? Who are you kidding?
9743000	9746000	You can't ride the Spider-Man train forever.
9746000	9750000	I know. All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go. Have a good one. Thank you for the call, though.
9750000	9753000	Hey, no problem. You take care, bros. You too. Bye.
9753000	9757000	And I think with that, I am going to go ahead and wrap up. I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through.
9757000	9762000	But remember, you can always email us. Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com and I would definitely encourage you to do that.
9762000	9767000	But we are going to wrap up here in studio tonight. That was a fun show. Thank you, Loki, as always, for being here.
9767000	9770000	And thank you, listeners, as always, for being here.
9770000	9774000	Because again, we do tape live on Sunday nights at the Voice Heats Network, vognetwork.com.
9774000	9778000	But I know many of you listen to us through our podcast feed and we are very thankful for that.
9778000	9783000	Because the live experience is going to be changing very, very soon. I would say within the next six weeks.
9783000	9785000	We're going to be making that big move to Twitch.
9785000	9789000	And for those of you on the podcast feed, though, nothing's going to change. So don't worry about it.
9789000	9794000	Just maybe the audio will kind of sound a little different because we'll be recording it a little differently, hopefully on some newer equipment.
9794000	9799000	And then we are going to be making a hosting change behind the scenes. But again, all that shouldn't really affect you guys.
9799000	9802000	We do appreciate you guys listening to our show every week and supporting Orange Launch Radio.
9802000	9809000	Thank you, as always. Whether you've been listening for all 15, 16 years or you just started listening last week, we appreciate you being here.
9809000	9812000	Please help us spread the word. Tell a friend or two about our show.
9813000	9819000	Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only air the voices that are here to basically be aired.
9819000	9823000	So that's that. Now we'll get everybody's final thought.
9823000	9827000	Oh, I always say a quick five star review on a place like iTunes and all that goes a long way.
9827000	9830000	I've said that enough and we never seem to get new ones anyway.
9830000	9833000	But I'll say it again because you never know. Maybe this will be the week.
9833000	9836000	Anyway, final thoughts time. It's time to get everybody's final thought.
9836000	9838000	Loki, you want to go first? What's your final thought tonight?
9838000	9845000	I forgot to mention, well, I looked at this earlier this week, but Humble Bundle right now has another PlayStation 4 deal that's coming right now.
9845000	9846000	Oh, I didn't know that.
9846000	9848000	THQ games, so if you're interested in that.
9848000	9851000	Giana Sisters could be had for a dollar and Lock's Quest.
9851000	9855000	Oh, shit. Well, Giana Sisters, they gave away on the Xbox Gold a while ago.
9855000	9856000	Right.
9856000	9858000	But, I mean, for charity, for a dollar.
9858000	9859000	Yeah, really.
9859000	9867000	You know, they have This Is The Police, The Dwarves, Red Faction 2, Black Mirror, and Destroy All Humans 2 for $12.28, which is the BP average and $15.
9867000	9873000	Titan Quest, Darksiders, War Master Edition, Cinamori, EXEN, Battle Chasers, Night War.
9873000	9876000	That's a lot of stuff. That's a lot of games.
9876000	9877000	Yeah, a lot of games.
9877000	9878000	I like my deals.
9878000	9880000	I think I have a lot of these already, though.
9880000	9881000	We'll see.
9881000	9882000	That's it.
9882000	9883000	Alright.
9883000	9889000	And then my final thought is, so I didn't talk about this during my gaming week, but you know I play those online reality games.
9889000	9891000	I was playing another one recently.
9891000	9893000	Guess what? Guess what, Loki? Guess what?
9893000	9895000	I was playing a Big Brother one online. Guess what happened?
9895000	9896000	You got voted out?
9896000	9898000	You got voted out before the jury again.
9900000	9904000	I'm the biggest flop in these things, but yet I still continue to play.
9904000	9908000	Alright, anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Challenge Radio.
9908000	9911000	Thank you guys so much for listening to our show and supporting it.
9911000	9912000	We appreciate you guys.
9912000	9914000	And we will see you next time, next week.
9914000	9915000	We'll do it all again next week, right?
9915000	9918000	Next week's show is going to have to last us two weeks, though, so we've got to make it extra good.
9918000	9921000	So we'll see you here in seven days to do it all over again.
9921000	9922000	Thank you again for listening.
9922000	9923000	Have a great week.
9923000	9924000	Happy gaming.
