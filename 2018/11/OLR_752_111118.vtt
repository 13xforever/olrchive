00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, things go away such as upcoming DLC for one major game and a publisher of video game guides

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
But there are new releases on the way too and we will talk about all that and more on this week on the show where every gamer has a voice

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight episode number 752 for this November the 11th of 2018

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you in studio with my co-host, Techmaster Loki

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
How are you?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
I'm fine

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Good, good to have you back here

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
It's gonna be our last show for two weeks, well yeah cause we won't be here next week

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
So this is the Thanksgiving special I suppose

01:02.000 --> 01:12.000
Although we will be here the Sunday after Thanksgiving which will pretty much be right after the Black Friday holiday

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Steam sale

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Supposedly

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
All sales

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
All the sales really

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Well what's interesting is that usually that's the point in the year where like okay that's it

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
All the video games are out for the year, they're all out now

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Not this year

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
Not this year, no you're right because especially Smash Ultimate is probably like the huge exception

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
And the same day

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
And

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
The same day as Smash Ultimate

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Is

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Earth Defense Wars 5

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
Oh how could I forget, you're absolutely right, Earth Defense Wars 5 is also coming out that same day

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
Not here tonight in studio, Dark Soccer or JB Summers, she is still on a work conflict for a little while

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
She will be joining us through Radio Magic later in the show

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
Of course you guys are joining us in our chat room as you do every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
When we tape live at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
We tape of course Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
And if you are listening to us live, you can join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
And as I mentioned there a little programming note, we will not be here next Sunday

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
I will be in Las Vegas or actually on Sunday I will be coming back from Las Vegas

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
Having just attended the Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest for the year 2018

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
This is, it's kinda like Blizzcon

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
But for the other MMO that a lot of people play, Final Fantasy IV

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
Actually I should, there's plenty of MMOs that lots of people play

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
But Final Fantasy XIV is another big one and it's one that I've been playing pretty much

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
I played the 1.0 version of the game ok, I suffered through the 1.0 version of the game

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
But my love of the online Final Fantasies goes back to Final Fantasy XI

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Which Loki and I used to play as well

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Do you still get the emails begging you to come back to Final Fantasy XI?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
No

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Oh they just, they're showing up on my Instagram

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Final Fantasy XI is like advertising on Instagram

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
And they're doing some big campaign right now and I didn't even see all the details

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
If I wanna know the details

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I would love to come back to Final Fantasy XI

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
If they make it free

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Where is Final Fantasy XI that I can come back to? Isn't it not online anymore?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
No it is, it's been online for PC

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
You cannot connect anymore on Playstation or Xbox 360

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
They took off that support, it's only PC

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
I thought they shut the whole thing down

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
No, it's only, no

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
The PC version is still going, I have a friend that still plays it

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
So it's still there

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
And they still add to it

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
They're still doing little things here and there

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
I mean, since they use basically a made up language

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
They'll talk about all these new zones

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
And I'm like, I have no idea what that word means

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
But sounds cool, go off I guess

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
So yeah, so

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
But this Fan Fest I'm going to in Vegas has nothing to do with XI

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
It's all about XIV which, you know, I do enjoy

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I've been on a little bit of a hiatus from XIV

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Just because I kinda, I don't really do the raiding

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
I don't do a lot of the endgame progression that other people do

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
So I'm just kind of in a lull right now

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
But that's why I'm excited to go to this event

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Because it will be inevitably announcing next year's expansion

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Because it's a very obvious pattern now

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
And not only that, but they'll probably get to, you know, do some special fights on the computer

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Special stuff and there'll be some panels

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
And most of all, most importantly, concerts

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
So they're doing the two concerts again

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
So they're going to have a piano concert one night

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
And then they're going to have the Primals

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Which is the band fronted by Soken

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Who does the music of Final Fantasy XIV

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
And even if you don't play Final Fantasy XIV

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Even if you have no interest in MMOs

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Seriously, go listen to some of the soundtrack songs of Final Fantasy XIV

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Because it's amazing

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
And Soken has done a great job

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
So his band will be there with that concert

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
So I'm just excited to just take that all in

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
And some other friends of mine are going to be there

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
It'll be good

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Anyway, we're going to get into tonight's kickoff topic here in a moment

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Which is also about Final Fantasy

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
First I want to address a couple of things that don't have anything to do with video games

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
But I think they're important to say

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
First of all, happy Veterans Day

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I think that's very important

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Because I know we have plenty of veterans that listen to Orange on Triadio

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
So I just want to say thank you for what you do

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
And your service

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
And defending our right to have this show

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
To have our lame ass opinions

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
And the freedom of speech that everybody defends out there

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Working hard in our military

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
So happy Veterans Day to all of you

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
The other thing I want to address is that

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
It's really smoky here in Sacramento

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I went out last night and I had to wear a mask

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Because of all this smoke that's everywhere

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
It's awfully inconvenient

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
But it's nothing compared to what's happening up the road a little bit

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
In the town of Paradise

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Or, I can't even believe I'm saying this

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
What was the town of Paradise?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I don't know if you all know this

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
But if you've ever read my bio

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
On vogginetwork.com

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I actually went to Chico State for a few years

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
And I was involved with radio up there

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
So Chico is kind of like the larger town in California

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Let's be real, when you go north of Sacramento

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
In San Francisco, there isn't a lot

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
From here to the border

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
It's a very different California

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
It's the red woody part of California

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
It's very different from what you all might think of

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
If you haven't been to California before

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
So, Chico is one of the larger towns

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Because it has the school

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
But I distinctly remember

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I had an old roommate who used to fix computers

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
In the town of Paradise

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
And there was a road, you take the skyway

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
You go up the skyway, Paradise is this lovely town

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
That sits up on the hill

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
It's gorgeous views from up there

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
It's why they call it that

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I do remember visiting the town

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And having memories

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I'm shocked

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I'm in a state of OMG

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Just hearing that the town is gone

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
And it's not just affecting Paradise

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I'm hearing now

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
It's moved into Magalia

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
And some of the other cities up there

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
That I bet a lot of you probably don't know

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Because they are smaller communities in California

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
But it's very, very, very, very scary

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Obviously, this is not the only part of California

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
That's on fire right now

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
It's the one that is

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I feel like I have a little bit of connection to it

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Because I know a lot of people from those days

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
That are being affected by this

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
But certainly the town of Thousand Oaks

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Experiencing multiple tragedies this week

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I mean, we had the unspeakable event

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
That happened at the country western bar with a shooter

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
And then, now they're on fire too

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
And that's affecting Malibu

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
And I'm sure some of you guys have been hearing about that one

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Because of the celebrities posting

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
That their homes are gone

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
It's crazy

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
It's so, so crazy

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
And I was really, really disappointed

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
You know, I don't like to get political on the show

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
And I like to keep it video games

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
But I was really disappointed

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
That our leader of this nation

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Could not write

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
A humane tweet

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
About the situation

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
And instead felt the need to

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Use it as an opportunity to attack California

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
When I believe over 90%

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Of the forest land in California

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Is actually federally overseen

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
So, congrats

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
You played yourself, jerk

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
But I was so mad about that

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
But anyway, again, I'm not

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I promise I won't get political, so I'm just gonna swallow that thought

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
But it was just very

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Very irritating to read about

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
But if you want to try to make a positive

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
About it, no matter where you're at politically

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I would refer you to a page

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I don't often do this

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
But it's just a great compilation

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
That one of our local television stations

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Put together, because I don't want to tell you

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
To do one charity or the other charity

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Everybody might have different ways to look into it

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
So, this is a shout out to one of our local

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
TV stations, but it's cbs13.com

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Slash help

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
So, it's very easy to understand

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
URL as well, cbs13.com slash help

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
And if you see a charity in there that looks like

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Something you could help out with

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
And help these folks up in Paradise

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Megalia, the North State, and people that are facing

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
This, I think that would be

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Really, really great

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
So, I just wanted to give a shout out to that

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Okay, anyway, I had to get it off my chest

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I know it doesn't have to do with video games

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
But, some things are a bigger deal

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I heard some video of it was making

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
It's way around video game blogs

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
One of my friends was like, did you see the video on Kotaku

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
With the fire, and I was like

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Why is it on Kotaku, but

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I mean, these are things that impact us

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
All, gamers and non-gamers alike

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Okay, let's shift gears, Loki

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Let's talk about video games

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Because that is the podcast you all signed up to hear

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And when it is smoky outside

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
On a day like today, I know I

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Sat in the house and I played video games all day

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Which we'll talk about during my gaming week

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
But, some people might be

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Playing games that are not going to have

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Much DLC in the future, right, Loki?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Yeah, and this is one game that I've played

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Like, ten minutes of and really needed to go back

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
To its own point, but I'm not doing that yet

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
So, Final Fantasy XV

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
They have announced

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
That three of the four upcoming pieces

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Of DLC have been cancelled

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
And right now

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
The one that is

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Remaining is going to be coming out

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Looks like next year

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And so, the one that's left

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Is going to be the Arden

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
And that will be coming out March 2019

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
So, the

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Ariane

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
What is it?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Arane, Luna and Noctis

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Ariane, I think is how you say it

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I don't remember, but yeah

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Those are cancelled

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And then along with that

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
They said

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
They're going to be releasing a short form

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Anime called Final Fantasy XV

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Episode Arden Prologue

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And that's going to be coming out

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Looks like they have

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Teasers that are going to be coming out on December 15th

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
And it's going to release on

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
January 10th

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
And then

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
They've got a Final Fantasy

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
XV Multiplayer Comrades

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Which is going to be coming out on

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
And that's on December 12th

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
The multiplayer has been out

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
This is some type of stand alone thing

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And it's going to be

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Some stand alone thing that will include new bosses

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Costumes, weapons and what not

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
So, they have multiplayer in the game now?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I know, they patched it in a long time ago and I never bothered to check it out

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Which might be part of the problem, but we'll get to that

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And then of course

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
They said that there is going to be a collaboration with Final Fantasy XIV

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Online

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Adventurer from Another World

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
And that's going to be

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Playable in Final Fantasy XV

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I don't understand

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
How that's going to work, but that's on December 12th as well

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Interesting, well I know

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
They did an event for Lightning Returns

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
In Final Fantasy XIV and Lightning shows up

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
In the world of XIV and you kind of work with her

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
In some fates and then

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
If you get enough points from participating

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
You can dress up exactly

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I think for female characters

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
You get an outfit that looks just like Lightning

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
For male characters you get an outfit that looks like snow

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
So, yeah

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
That's what you got for participating

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
So imagine the XV crossover will be something similar in XIV

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
And then I don't know

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
If they'll put some of the bosses

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
In XV or what they're going to do

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I don't know how that's going to work

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
But, I mean, still kind of a big deal

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
That these big DLC pieces

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Are cancelled

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
And the guy left

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
He left Square Enix

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
The guy who had been designing all this

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Has left

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Which is a pretty big deal as well

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Yeah, so

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Hajime

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Tabata

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
He had left

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
And he had taken over for Tetsuya

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
And Nomura back in 2013

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
He's gone though

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Because Tetsuya Nomura is probably over on Kingdom Hearts 3 now

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Cranking that out and then still has

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
The Final Fantasy VII remake to do after that

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
So I wonder if there was some sort of

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Disagreement or something that caused him to leave

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Well, the disagreement may be

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
That they were talking

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
What, like a $44 million loss

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Or something like that on all this

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I mean, it's pretty incredible

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
The hit

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I don't know if it's specifically this

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
But Square Enix kind of took a hit

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
It seems like they're trying to recreate VII

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Like the phenomenon that was VII

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
With all the spin-offs and everything

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
And it's just not ever getting to that level

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Right

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I have mixed feelings about this

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Because I know XV has its fans

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
And I wouldn't even say I don't dislike XV

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Honestly, in the

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
In the scope of all Final Fantasy

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Games ever, XV is probably somewhere

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
In the middle of the pack for me

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
It's higher than VIII

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
It's higher than the original

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
NES trilogy, which I think it just

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Those NES games were good

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
And they were important, but they're outshone

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
By what the technology

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Of the later games can do

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
So I think I would rank it above some of those

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
But it's certainly not as good

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
As IV, VI, X

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
For me, I mean every

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Critic is going to have their own list

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Of how they rate the Final Fantasy games

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And certainly I know

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
How I feel about VIII is extremely

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Controversial, but

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah, XV I would say

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Is somewhere in the middle of the pack, but

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I think the thing that frustrates me

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And what frustrated me about XV to begin with

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Is that I bought the game

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I played this game start to finish

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
For what it was, and then it was like

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Oh hey, we're going to keep changing this game

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
But Final Fantasy

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Was never this

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Online persistent experience to me

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Because it takes you

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
50 hours to beat this game

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I don't know, it depends how fast you all play

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
But to hear them say, oh we're going to go back and change

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Chapter 13, or whatever

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Yeah, Chapter 13 was kind of

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Busted and probably needed to be re-looked at

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
But I don't want to go back and

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Just play that one chapter

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
And XV doesn't do anything for me

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
You know what I mean?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I'm not the biggest fan of

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Editing these games massively

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
After they're released

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
And then XV just kind of continued to do that

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
With this model

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I know some of the DLC was spin-off stuff

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
And that was fine

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
That's a way to do it

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
But I just felt like

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
In a way, and I think a lot of you kind of felt like this

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Is that with Final Fantasy XV it was like

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
They were consistently adding to this game

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
They wanted to be there

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
When it actually released

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
But they weren't able to actually put in the game

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Because they were forced to put the game out by a certain time

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Because it had been in development for so long

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Although we all know

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
That game's real development was only like

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
The last two or three years of the cycle

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
You know what I mean?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Especially if you go back and look at the original Versus 13 trailer

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
It is very clear

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Things were scrapped, things were changed

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
And probably when this creative change happened

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
The entire thing was scrapped and redone

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Which, you know

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Kind of goes back to

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Just sometimes how the big business

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
End of things can really screw things up

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
And it's what really ticked me off about the Mass Effect franchise too

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Now what's weird

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Is that with the Mass Effect franchise

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I kind of wish they would have been able to do some DLC

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
But the DLC in Mass Effect

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Would have been different

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Like it would have been after the game

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
They wouldn't have been trying to go back and change the game in progress

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
And when they started to do that

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Which, by the way, they started to do in Mass Effect Andromeda

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Was go back and change all this shit about the game in progress

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I lost interest completely

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I was like, here we go again

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
The game I bought is not the game they wanted to put out

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
They're going back and changing everything in the middle

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
You know what, I'll go back and play it in the year

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
When it's actually done

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
And unfortunately that attitude

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Across the board with a lot of people

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Probably helped that game to flop

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And now they're not going to do the Corian DLC

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
And you know that game is not remembered fondly

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
But in my opinion

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
EA fucking hosed that game

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
By forcing them to release it when they did

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I know that game would have been in development for a long time

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
But again, I think the real development cycle

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Was really towards the end of it

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
And it needed six more months in the oven

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
And we would have had a different story here

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I think

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Yeah

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
But um

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
What else did I want to say about Final Fantasy XV?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Then I'll look at our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
But with Final Fantasy XV

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
It's just like

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
In a way, I'm kind of

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I don't want to say I'm happy in this news

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
At all, because I don't want to take delight

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
In the loss or in the

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
You know, the

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm not one of those people that wants to see game companies

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Suffer because I know that means the game makers

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Suffer and that's not

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I don't see how that's going to make games better

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Like sometimes I read Twitter and I'm like

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
The fuck are you people thinking? Like these are people's

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Jobs and stuff

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
But at a higher level

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I am kind of like, in a way

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Glad they're going to finally walk away

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
From Final Fantasy XV in a way

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Like I mean they have these other little things to cap it off

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I'm kind of glad they're going to walk away from Final Fantasy XV

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
And they can focus on the next thing creatively

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Which I hope

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
There's a Final Fantasy XVI in the works somewhere

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
That hopefully has been in the works

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
For a while and hopefully will be done

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
By the time they want to release it

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
But I'm a little worried because

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Is it just me

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Or is Final Fantasy VII

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Final Fantasy XVI

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
That's the impression I get

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Final Fantasy Remake is being treated like

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
It's a full Final Fantasy title

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
So Final Fantasy VII

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Is Final Fantasy XVI if you get what I'm saying

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I kind of feel like that's where it's going

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
But I just hope

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Again creatively

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I think Final Fantasy kind of just needs

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
A kick in the pants with a new single player story

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I don't know if this did it

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
For a lot of people

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
You can go back to turn based combat

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Dungeon Buster

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Over in our chat

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
At live.vognetware.com giving me the numbers

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I was trying to reach for earlier

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
33 million from changes

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
To Luminous Studios

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Square Enix did not have a great quarter

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
But Japanese physicals tend to be pretty dry

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Octopath and Shadow of the Tomb Raider

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Apparently did okay

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
But we have no idea or numbers from Square Enix

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
On how well they actually did

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
But we do know from NPD

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
That Octopath anyway

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Was kind of a sleeper hit here

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
It was the number one game of the month

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
For that to do

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
So we do know some little things

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Here and there

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Let's see, Siya Tabiri in chat says

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Was it you guys who said that Final Fantasy VIII

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And The Spirits Within should have been swapped

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
That Final Fantasy VIII was more cinematic

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
And Final Fantasy The Spirits Within would have been better fodder

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
For an actual game

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Yes I have said that before

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Both of those things were in development around the same time

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
And I think Final Fantasy VIII as a movie

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Would have been amazing

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
And I think there's a lot of

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Ideas in The Spirits Within

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
That could have been a great game

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
And then it would have felt more like Final Fantasy

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I think maybe if it had been a game

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Perhaps others won't agree with me

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
But that's my opinion

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Let's see

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Dungeon Buster continues with another thought here

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I wasn't a huge fan

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Of Final Fantasy XV's direction

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
But it had enough to keep me on top of the hunts

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
And grind through its dungeons

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
It's still really surprising how far Square Enix was cutting back

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
However with this news

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Tigercall on chat talking about the Mass Effect thing

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Is it a little too soon

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
To reboot Mass Effect?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I don't know if

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Anybody wants to see them

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Reboot the Shepard story

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I think it's a good idea to do somebody else's

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Story in the same universe

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I think that's what they tried to do with

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Andromeda

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Andromeda was Ryder's story

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
And by setting it in this whole other galaxy

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
That was Square Enix's creative way

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Of having your choices

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
From the original Mass Effect trilogy

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Not have as great of an impact

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
And not need to have as much

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
To account for

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
In Mass Effect Andromeda

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
As a Mass Effect fan I would be okay

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
If they wanted to do somebody else's

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Continuing story in the Mass Effect universe

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
And do something like Dragon Age did

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
When they did Dragon Age Inquisition

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
And do an online thing

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
That lets you revisit

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Seven of the biggest decisions from the Mass Effect franchise

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
And tailor how

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Your Mass Effect universe went

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
From there

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I don't think it has to import my Mass Effect 3 save

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
And know every little nook and cranny

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Of what I did

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I would be okay if it was maybe

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
50 years later

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
And some of the big decisions have an impact

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Certainly there's going to be some of the big questions

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Like, did you cure the genophage?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
That's going to have a lasting effect

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Was there control

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Or synthesis

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
And they may have to

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
For the sake of creative reasons

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
The canon ending is the destroy ending

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
This game takes place

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
50 years after the destroy ending

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
In Mass Effect

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Although I know there will be fans out there that will be like

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
But my ending

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I would be totally okay with that

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
If Bioware came out and said

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
This is a Mass Effect game that takes place

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
After the destroy ending

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
And what happens here

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I would be totally fine with that

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Alright

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Looking in our chat with other comments over at

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Let's see

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
And on that note, when was the last time we saw any new trailers

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Or anything for that, the Final Fantasy 7 thing

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
At E3, Final Fantasy 7 was nowhere to be found

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
And they didn't do PlayStation Experience this year

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
So

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
They could

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Do the game awards

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Or something like that

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Or they may just sit on it for a little longer

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Which makes us all wonder

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
If that game is facing some development struggles

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Who knows

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Dungeon Buster says

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
But they can reboot the gameplay with new ideas

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And hopefully new stories

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And Bobby Blackwolf says

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Then they can make another game that takes place after the

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Non-destroy ending

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
They could

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
But I bet they would be more interested in making a trilogy

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
That takes place kind of in the same

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
General world, but we'll see

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Why don't we just do it like Pokemon

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Where they have, you know

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Red, green, and blue or whatever

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
This is the destroy ending one

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I think the reality is

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
It's different depending on your ending

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
That they would really be two separate games

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Developed concurrently and I just think

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Financially that's not the best idea

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
They really need to take the Fallout 4 approach

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Where it doesn't matter what you do, it all ends up being the same anyways

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Honestly

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
To get another Mass Effect game

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I would be completely okay if BioWare says

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
These are the canon changes

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
That we're exploring

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And due to limitations we're just not going to be able to

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Allow you to import your own

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Shepard experience

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
If they're going to come out with another Mass Effect game

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
It would be for like Playstation 5 at this point

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
I wouldn't expect that you're going to be able to import

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
A Playstation 3 save file

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Onto your Playstation 5, it's fine

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I can let that go

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Just give me a good

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Freaking Mass Effect game

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Of course they can't even play Playstation 1 games

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
On the Playstation 4

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
So what makes you think they're going to be able to import any

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Saves in the Playstation 5

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Mega Man X400 is in chat

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
They're saying calling it right now

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Final Fantasy 7 Remake will become Final Fantasy 16

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
It will be different enough that Square

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Will say it's a new game

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
That would be, that would be risky

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
I could see them taking some changes

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
And liberties with the story and maybe trying to do something like that

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
But it would just, it would be weird

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
I don't think they would ever do that

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I don't, I just see them releasing

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
It as Final Fantasy 7

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
And just dropping the word remake

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Why not just do that?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I would think that is more plausible

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Than Final Fantasy 16

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
I think they're developing something else

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
They've got to be

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
We saw a Square Enix

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Crystal Tools trailer or something

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I remember seeing something for the Playstation 4

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
That showed all this crazy stuff

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
That Square Enix was working on

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
I don't think it was intended to be

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
People thought, is there Final Fantasy 16 stuff in there?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Eh, probably not

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
But there might be pieces in that

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
That maybe they're going to work with

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I would really like to see

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Square Enix, here's what they could do

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
In my opinion

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
They're probably using Final Fantasy 15's

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Engine for Final Fantasy 7

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
You don't say based on the trailers

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah right, which is fine

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I would be completely fine if they

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Use Final Fantasy 15's remake

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Or Final Fantasy 15 remake

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Final Fantasy 15's engine

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
To make Final Fantasy 16

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
But instead of it being like

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
The Broad Trip type of game

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Give me something that makes me think

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Final Fantasy 9

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I'm not saying literally those characters

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
But you know how Final Fantasy 9

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Was a throwback to the classic Final Fantasy

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Like, Vivi looked like a Black Mage

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I'd rather it be Final Fantasy 6

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
But I'm saying give me that

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Classic Final Fantasy taste

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
In that

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Final Fantasy 7 isn't even really that either

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Give me that

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Sure, Final Fantasy 6 inspired or whatever

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Give me that classic Final Fantasy taste

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
In Final Fantasy 15's engine

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I would be super into

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Characters just with the medieval look

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
As opposed to the cyberpunk look

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
And I would be super into it

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I would love that

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
So, we'll see

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Let's see, Dartitsia says

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Final Fantasy 15 remake

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Coming to the Playstation 9 in 2040

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
And the Mega Man X400 follows up his comment

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
And our reaction by saying

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Don't be mad when it happens

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I won't be mad

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
But it would be weird

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Hey, we just finished Final Fantasy 15

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
We've tweaked all this up

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Let's make a Final Fantasy 15 remake

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
To be fair, to Delvin's credit

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
You know what else was weird?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Final Fantasy 11 being an MMO

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
That you had to pay a monthly fee for

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
So, you know what?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Weird or cool?

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Well, the game turned out great, but I never understood

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Why they just didn't call it

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Final Fantasy Online

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Like, would that have been a terrible thing to call the game?

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Like, would less people have played it

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I don't think that would

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
But then, what would Final Fantasy 14 be?

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I guess it would be Final Fantasy Online

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Well, 14 was weird too, because it's like

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Yeah, we have all the same races

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
We're just gonna call them something different

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Well, that's because 1.0 is garbage

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
And then, the realm we're born is fantastic

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
But they were pigeonholed in all the garbage decisions 1.0 made

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
So, they did the best they could, dammit

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Dartitsia says

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Like how Phantasy Star Online did it

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Then Final Fantasy 14 could have been Final Fantasy Universe

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Even if not as many people enjoyed Final Fantasy

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Not as many people enjoyed Final Fantasy Star Universe

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
We're gonna get a goddamn Final Fantasy game that's gonna have

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
The Destiny model, where it's like this single multiplayer garbage

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
It's called Final Fantasy 15

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Oh, is this what I've missed?

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Not playing the game?

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
No, I'm not being fair

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
But, think about it

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
All of a sudden, now there's an online mode

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I want you to keep grinding

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
It's just weird

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I don't think I always understood all the approaches

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Maybe you disagree with me

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
And you can send an email

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
That's fine, participate at orangeloungeradio.com

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
If you want to send us an email with your thoughts

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Bobby Black Wolf says

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Yes, but then Final Fantasy Universe would have been released in the US

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Frowny face

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
That's Final Fantasy Online 2

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
By that thinking

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Because we did get Phantasy Star Universe on Xbox 360

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I loved it!

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I was like, I don't understand

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Debate for another show

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Everybody hated that game

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
You know what game I really loved?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
The single player

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
PSP game

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
That was Universe's engine

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
But they made a single player PSP game

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
It was Phantasy Star

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I don't remember what they called it, but it was great

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Because it was a completely different game than Universe

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
But it was just like that exact same engine

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
But single player, and it was great

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Anyway

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Well let's take a trip down memory lane

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Of our gaming weeks and talk about the types of

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Video games that we have been playing this week

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
It was okay

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I played a little bit of

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
PlayStation VR

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Like on Friday I finally remembered

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Oh yeah, that's right

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Tetris Effect came out this week

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
So then I decided to sit down and play it

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
For a little bit, so I did

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
And I liked the new tracks that were in there

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
But yeah

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
I ran into the problem with it drifting to the left

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Unfortunately because I was playing in PlayStation VR

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
So that was a little bit irritating

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
And then I decided to

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Try some of the other games, because I've had a bunch of

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
VR games sitting on my hard drive

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I just haven't bothered to actually

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Play them yet, so one of the ones

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I was actually looking forward to was

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Just In Time Incorporated

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Which is a VR game

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It's a silly

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Premise where you're

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
This government agency, or some sort of

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Agency that

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Gets to a location

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Right before people are about to die

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
And you have to prevent them from dying

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Usually by killing somebody

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Else, and it's pretty funny

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
So the very first tutorial

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Mission that they put you in

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
There's this person in an alley

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
A seedy alley next to a strip club

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And there's this guy charging at

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Him with a knife

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
And because you're wearing these special gloves

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Everything moves ten times

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Slower than it would in real life

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
So what you do, you grab the knife out of the

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Hand of the guy that's about to stab him

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
And you stab the guy in the face

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
And that's the end of the mission

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Okay, and it's awesome

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
It's hyper-violent, and it's

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
It's a silly

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Fun game, so it's like if you

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I don't know, crossing

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Job simulator with

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
A hyper-violent game

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Hyper-violent job simulator

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Okay, I can dig it

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I play a little bit of

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I stream more DDR

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
And

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I had a heart rate monitor

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Working, but unfortunately

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Fitbit decided to

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Just MVP their whole

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Windows 10 app

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
And so the Windows 10

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
App sucks ass

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
And doesn't work all the time

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
In fact, I only got to

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Work once with the actual

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
With it being able to detect my Fitbit

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
So now, it won't detect it anymore

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Like, I got it to sync just fine

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
With my computer, I got the heart rate monitor

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
To display, because we have recorded footage

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Of that, and everything was perfectly fine

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
And sure enough, to turn on the next day

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
None of it wants to work again

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
And I blame the app

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
And Windows 10, because Windows 10 is buggy

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
As fuck, so you know

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
What are you gonna do?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
So I guess I have to buy this

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Unnecessary dongle that's

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Got a plug in there to sync a Bluetooth

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Thing to my computer, despite the fact that

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I have Bluetooth built in

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
And it was synced to it at one point

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I don't know, it's stupid

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
But that may be what I

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Have to do to get it to work

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Or just not put it in there

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Because that may be the other option

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Since it's just being difficult

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
We'll see

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
So there's that, and then

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Of course I was working a little bit more

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
On my StepMania theme that I was gonna

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Put on the cabinet

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Once I load StepMania on there

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
So I was doing a little bit of that

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
And picking out songs I want to put on there

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
As well

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Then, oh yeah

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
My new DVD drive

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
That's gonna be able to put that super disk

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
On there, that is coming

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Very soon, hopefully

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Actually, it last scanned in Washington

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
So it's just a few states away

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Hopefully gonna get it next week

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
So we'll be able to do that

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Preferably before

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
20th of November

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
It's the big day you're shooting for

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Exactly

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Are you gonna do an epic DDR stream on 20th of November?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Probably not, because it'll just be

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
After work, but we'll see what we can do

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Alright, my gaming week

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
So I finally

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Set up the PlayStation VR

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Because I needed to play me

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Some Tetris Effect, which just came out

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Of course on PlayStation 4

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I talked about the demo a little bit

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Last week and how much I enjoyed that

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
So obviously I was gonna get the retail version of the game

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
We all knew that

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I have said it on the show before

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I'm a huge fan of Tetsuya Mizuguchi

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I don't know if there's a game he's done that I didn't like

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I even kind of thought

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
99 Nights was alright

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
But as far as things like Every Extend Extreme

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Luminous

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Meteos, Space Channel 5

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I've always really loved

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
These games

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
So when I heard that he got the Tetris license

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
And that E3 trailer

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Already sold, like I didn't even need a demo

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
I didn't need anything else, all I needed was that

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Hey, Mizuguchi's doing a Tetris game

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Sold, done, right?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
It's basically Mizuguchi's doing a bullet

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
It doesn't matter, it's like okay, I'll buy it

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
He can do a bullet hell game and I'd buy it

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I don't give a shit

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
He's great, I'm such a fan

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
So I'm saying that

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Kind of as a disclaimer

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Because maybe my opinion is a little biased

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Because I've always been a fan of his

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
But I fucking love Tetris Effect

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Outstanding

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
It's one of my favorite gaming experiences

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
In the last several years, honestly

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
It's

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
And I know there's people that are probably just going

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
It's just Tetris though

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Alright, but this is like

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Honestly the best version of Tetris they've done

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
And yes, I'm including the original NES

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Yes, I'm including the Game Boy version

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Yes, I'm including the DS version

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
That was pretty good too

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
That's not to say any of those versions were bad

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Or more importantly, important

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
The original NES version

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Of course, I mean Nintendo's version

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Not the Atari version

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Although it was important for its own reasons too

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
The Game Boy version was massively important

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
But Tetris Effect is like

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
The best one

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
And using the technology that's available today

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
And they have an homage to the

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Game Boy Tetris song

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
In Tetris Effect

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Oh, I haven't discovered that yet

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
That's pretty cool

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I've discovered in some of the

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Marathon modes

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Or what are those

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Not the Journey, Effect

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
It's in one of the Effect ones

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
The Effect stuff, some of it has the classic Tetris

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Brick styles and stuff

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Which is cool

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
So here's the thing, some of you are probably going to be skeptical

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
And you're like, Rob, it's $40 for Tetris

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
But here's the thing

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Especially in VR

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
It's an experience

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
It's a trip

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
It is relaxing

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
It is engrossing

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
It is beautiful

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
I don't know how else to describe it

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
This is a great

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Application to sell PlayStation VR with

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Because you know what makes this great

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
You know what makes this great for PlayStation VR

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Is that it's not

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Like a jump around and flail

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
With the PlayStation Move game

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Not that there's anything wrong with those types of games

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
But I think it says a lot

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
That the experience of playing on PlayStation VR

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Where you're just simply sitting on the couch

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
With your headset on

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
And the controller

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
That playing this in PlayStation VR

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Allows the world around you

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
To literally disappear

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Especially if you're playing with headphones on

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
And really immersing the sound

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
As well as the visuals

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
It allows you to really just focus on

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
The game

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
And the experience of

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
The music and the art

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
That is being created as you're playing this game

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Because even though

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Yes you're removing distractions in the real world

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
You know there are

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I'm using my quoting fingers

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Distractions that the game provides

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
But it really feels like a journey

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
That you go on

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
When you complete lines

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Like let's say you're playing a stage

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Where the background is an ocean that you're flying across

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
And when you complete lines

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Dolphins will come out of the ocean

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Like in the rhythm to the music and do things

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
But then like maybe after you've cleared so many lines

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Things kind of like go underwater

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
It's like you're just doing this trip

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
But Tetris is just that central theme

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
But like

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
The nice thing is everybody knows

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
How to play Tetris

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I'm not saying everybody knows how to play Tetris well

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
But everybody understands I think

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
The basic concept of Tetris is not an incredibly

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Difficult one to explain

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
So this is just a really

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Easy game to get into

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
And even if you don't have PlayStation

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
VR I still think there's a lot

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Here worth seeing especially if you like

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Puzzlers I mean this is

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Tetris

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
If it was done like Luminous

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
That is exactly what it is

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
There's really nothing else for me to explain about this game

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Either you're gonna understand that

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Description or you're not because you've played Luminous

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
You're either gonna understand it or you're not

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
But even if you don't understand it

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I really like check out some YouTubes

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Check out some people playing

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
It check out what it looks like and

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Just see for yourself like what a

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Trip it is but if you can if you have a friend

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
That has PlayStation VR or something

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Really you owe it to yourself

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
To check this out in VR and really

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Experience how the

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Total immersion in a game

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Like this can really change

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
The game playing experience

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
It's really something to behold

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
And then I guess one other thing

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I'll say about it again the whole like it was

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
$40 for Tetris

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
You got like the main journey

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Or story mode that has lots and lots of skins

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
That you unlock as you're playing the game

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
But then there's also like this side mode

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
This effect mode where you have

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Sometimes weekend competitions

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
And you do this

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
You can do like mystery blocks

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Or you gotta clear 40 lines

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
As fast as possible or you have

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
To clear particular poison blocks

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
On the field in a certain amount of time

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Or you have to clear one

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Line over and over like there's all these different types

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Of like edit modes so it doesn't

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Really feel stale and you know

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
All these different type of edit modes have their own skins

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
And you're trying to play to unlock them

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
So that you can just do your own mode with the skins

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
That you like if that's what you want to do

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
And you know that's another thing that's available to you

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
But I know the game

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Is getting hazed a little bit because many people

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Remember Tetris for multiplayer

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Which is what the NES version

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
The DS version and the Game Boy

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Version really all brought to the table right

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Was the multiplayer actually did the NES version

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Have that maybe not

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Did the NES version no it did you can do side by side

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
It's been so long Loki

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I knew the Game Boy one was infamous

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
For that with link cable and everything ok yeah

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
The original NES did no I don't think

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I think Tengen Tetris had it

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I don't think NES Tetris had it

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Somebody in chat let me know about that

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Did Tetris NES have multiplayer

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I don't think it did

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
But anyway

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I know the Game Boy did

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
But anyway

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
I don't think the game

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Totally needs

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Multiplayer I kind of feel

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Like that's a door they left shut

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Because if there is a Tetris

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Effect 2 and I really hope there

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Is a Tetris Effect 2 and this game

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Deserves a Tetris Effect 2 I have a

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Feeling that's a door they'll open and explore

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
But for this they wanted it to really be about the

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Immersion the experience

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
And when you are sitting there with a VR

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Headset on maybe looking at

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Another player to yell at them about how they're stacking

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Up lines on you is not something that really

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Fits in with that picture you know you can't really

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Immerse and do multiplayer

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I think so

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Maybe that's why they made the artistic

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Decision they did

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Dark Tetsuya said Tengen Tetris did

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Two modes in fact

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
And Mega Man X400 says

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
NES Tetris had multi I thought it didn't

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I thought the Tengen one did

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
And that's why people crave

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
That cart more but I didn't think

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Oh well it doesn't

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Ultimately at this point that game is how old

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
This is the new shit get on Tetris Effect

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Leave the multiplayer

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Behind for a little bit if you must play

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Multiplayer Tetris get

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
The Tetris DS because it's

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
It's a great version of that

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
And has many other great stuff too but this is

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Worth it on its own merits

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
As far as other games I've been

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Playing this week I have been continuing Diablo 3

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
On the Switch I was streaming a little bit

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Of that actually and I'm just about

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
To hit level 70 on my seasonal character

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
So I've been making away

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
On that otherwise

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I've been still playing a little bit of

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
World of Warcraft I think my

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Little warlock there is level

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
118 so I'm almost to level

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
120 where I can do the cool kid end game stuff

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
But for right now just still stuck on

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Level 118 and trying to work on that

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
So that is about it for my gaming

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Week so we'll get on into

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
The rest of the news for this week usually

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I would do housekeeping but I've already told you

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
We're not going to be here next week so

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
But I look forward to

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Talking to you guys all about Final Fantasy

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Fan Fest you can always follow me on Twitter

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Of course if you want some tweets because I'm sure

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I'll be tweeting up a storm while I'm there

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Maybe if the cell signal

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Is decent maybe I'll do a twitch stream

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
From the convention floor because that's something people

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Do now right so

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Yeah maybe I'll try doing that if

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Big if my cell phone signal

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Cooperates I don't remember how good

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
It was or wasn't

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
At the Rio because they had it

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
At the Rio in 2014 but they did it at a

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Different hotel in 2016 so I don't remember

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
What the cell signal was like there but I do

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Remember in 2014 one of the gifts

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
They gave you in the goodie bag which I thought

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Was brilliant a little cell phone charger

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
And it was already like full

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
And ready to go and I was like this is

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
This is brilliant sadly I don't think they've already

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Released the contents of this year's goodie bag

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
I don't think they have that you get like a full

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Like actual backpack this year which is kind of cool

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Cool yeah but they also

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Released an update about how we're all gonna

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Have to go through metal detectors to get into the convention

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Just because of the way the

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
World is in 2018 just compared to even

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
2016 yeah when that wasn't a factor

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
But

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
That is what it is alright anyhow

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Let's get into some other gaming news Loki

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Alright so this is

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Sad but Prima Games is shutting

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Down after 28 years

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Prima of course you may remember

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Does strategy guides for

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Such games

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Like we were talking about earlier Final

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Fantasy 15 for example or

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
You know I think even Grand Theft Auto and that

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Type of stuff so they're gonna be

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Closing their doors

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I wonder why

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Now they're not closing

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Until next spring but they're not

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Gonna be publishing any new strategy guides for

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
The remainder of this year

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Aren't they

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
The ones that are here locally I think they are local

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
They're the ones that are out in Roseville right

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Because I know there's two big strategy guide

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Companies and I think Prima is the one that's out in Roseville

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Which is not far from here

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Yeah I think so

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
I don't know

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
I don't remember if

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
That is them

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I think it could be though

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I think it is but I mean

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Regardless it is still

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Still a little I mean I would say it's surprising

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
And at the same time I hate to say it like with the internet

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Having

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Dismantled regular instruction manuals

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
But I mean strategy guides

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Were always a heck of a collectible

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
They were and also

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Like sometimes

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I know I can use the internet for like certain things

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Like I know with Grand Theft Auto 5

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I bought the strategy guide twice

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I bought it when they had

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
You know the Xbox 360

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
PlayStation 3 version and then I bought it again

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
When it came out for

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Or was it 4 I'm thinking of

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
I must be thinking of 4

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I don't know one of them I probably bought it for 5 as well

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
No I did definitely buy it for 5

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
So I bought it again when the

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC versions

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Came out too because they had a whole new

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Strategy guide and it was you know

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I bought it to

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
100% everything

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Which I still haven't done

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Prima is located in Roseville

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
And I'm going to get very local for a minute

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
But it's for Loki's understanding

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
You know how there's Kaiser out in Roseville? Yeah I know where it is

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Target's on one side, Prima's on the other

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Well myself and Jamie we got invited to go there one time

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
That's right you guys went there once

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
And I didn't go

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
But we ended up not being able to meet with them

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Like something our cancel lesson

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I think Jamie did

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I know she did but anyway that was a long time ago

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
I don't remember if that was

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Like a secret meeting or what that was all about

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Doesn't matter now

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
But it's still unfortunate

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
To hear what that's all going through over there

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
But I think again

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
It's just the whole internet industry

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Just really

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Kind of people go to Game Facts

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
YouTube

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
YouTube is a huge thing too

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Absolutely now go into our chat over at

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Live.vognetwork.com

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
It says nobody reads game guides anymore

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
It's all about the YouTube walkthroughs

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Even Game Facts gets less used these days

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Cuddlebucket in chat

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
I like that name

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Says their money probably came from licensing I think

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Can't imagine sales for physical guides have been great

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Since the internet age

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I always kind of saw

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Again I saw it more as like collectibles

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
People just like to have that coffee table book

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
You know

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I mean I use the hell out of

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
The Grand Theft Auto 5 one

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Because it was

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
You have to make sure that you didn't miss anything

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
So that you can get 100%

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
And I know with games like Red Dead Redemption 2

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
There's ways you can miss missions

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
And stuff in the game

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
If you don't do everything

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
And Grand Theft Auto 5 was kind of like that too

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
With some of the characters you can pick up for the heist missions

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
If you didn't do the one thing at a certain time

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
You'll miss it

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
And that's where the guide comes in

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
And also finding collectibles

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Because fuck that shit

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Tell me where they are and I'll just go pick them up

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Kaijuto in chat says

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Oh strategy guide I thought it was the game mag

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
The game mags suck

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
I don't think Prima had a game magazine

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Maybe they did at one point

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
But they were definitely more known for the guides

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
And that was

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
I remember when you'd go into Game Flop

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
And it would be like oh I'm going to pre-order this game

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
They do that now

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Oh you want to get the strategy guide with it?

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Yeah you get 20% off the strategy guide

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Doesn't Game Flop use their own

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
In-house guide creator at this point?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
No I don't think so

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Because Red Dead you can buy it

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Or they even have one for Super Mario Odyssey

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
And they're starting to get phone book thick

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
With a game like Red Dead I'm sure

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Yeah

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Alright

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Cia Tabiri in chat says

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
The strategy guides almost felt like enhanced art books sometimes

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
And that's not a bad thing though

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Right?

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Some of them were

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Final Fantasy VII strategy guide

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
And it was like its own unique art and stuff

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I think Allen used to love to buy those guides

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Like back in the day

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Because we have a bunch of them on the bookshelf

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
They're for old ass players

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
They're more collectible items

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
They are

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Moving on

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Let's talk a little bit about some news out of Microsoft

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Because Microsoft had their

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
X018 event this weekend

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
In Mexico City which was pretty cool

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Because you know usually it's like

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
They do something in New York, Vegas

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Los Angeles, maybe Europe

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Maybe Japan

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
But you don't often hear of like a big game event in Mexico

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
So that was pretty cool that you know they got something there

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
So for the

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
X018 event we did get a little bit of news

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I would say probably like not

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Major major stuff on

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
The par of what you

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Get out of a

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Playstation experience event

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Which reminder they're not doing one this year

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Which is interesting

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
But we did get some minor updates

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Including the fact that PUBG is going to be added to Game Pass

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Microsoft continues to really try to push

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
The Game Pass which is

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
It's hard to argue with that

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
They're really trying to up the value of that

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Another game that they're going to be putting on Game Pass

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Crackdown 3

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Which has it's official launch game

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
February 19th, 2019

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I thought it was 15th

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Might depend on the part of the world

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
The article I'm looking at says February 9th

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
That could be Europe

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
No it is 15th, I think there's a typo

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
In the show world thread, that's fine

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
So it's February 15th, my bad

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Heaven forbid they make you wait

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
4 more days Loki, you've been waiting how long

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
No

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
No more waiting

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Done, I'm done waiting

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I gotta say though, I did watch the trailer for it

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
And Terry Crews is awesome

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Of course, we knew that

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Terry Crews

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
It's totally just like

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
An Old Spice commercial right there

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
He had one where it was him

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Yelling at himself

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Because it was his character and then him playing himself

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Telling each other to be

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Prepared for anything or something like that

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
It was ridiculous

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
And I loved every second of it

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
I saw the gameplay

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Oh man

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
They have really

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Toned down the visuals on that

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
It's not like

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Remember, we need the cloud

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
The cloud's gotta process all this destruction

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Because it's so crazy

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
This multiplayer mode has an arena

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
That you can destroy

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
It's not the city, it's an arena

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
It's not as

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
As a spectacle

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
As it was before

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
I'm still gonna buy it

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
I don't fucking care

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
It's disappointing

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Let's see, also this is a pretty big deal

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I think for some people

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
The Final Fantasy 13 trilogy

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Is being added to

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Backwards compatibility on Xbox One

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
That's pretty cool

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
Except for the fact that

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
The games I own are all on PlayStation

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
But that's fine, whatever, congrats

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Well, you just have to wait for that PlayStation

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Backwards compatibility

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
But that's really cool

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
For the Xbox folks

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
And I think they said something about

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Civilization Revolutions

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Getting like a 4K

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
That's pretty rad

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
If I had an Xbox One X, I'd be really excited

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
But I don't, but I still think that's really cool

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
They're supporting that

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
They did show another Kingdom Hearts 3 trailer

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
With the 100 Acre Wood

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
They talked about mouse and keyboard support

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
On Xbox One coming very soon

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
And they did confirm Fortnite will be a mouse and keyboard game

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
On Xbox One

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
So, cool

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Even though I would kinda wonder

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Why you're not using a PC

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
But I suppose not everybody has a PC

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
As beefy as perhaps an Xbox One X

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Is capable of processing

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
So, still pretty neat I guess

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
And then they did detail some of the expansion

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
For Forza Horizon 4

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Where you're gonna be looking for treasure

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
In lightning storms

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
So it looks like you'll be kinda using that weather stuff again

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
But this time it's gonna be lightning

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
But you can't take any damage from the lightning

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
So what does it matter?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Yeah, exactly, who cares

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
I mean, with all these stuff I've crashed into

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
If lightning hits the car, that's actually safe

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
They say you can be in a car

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
And if lightning hits the car, you'll be fine

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
It's like a big conductor, I guess

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
It's not gonna be very effective in all those backwards compatibility games

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Stop it, stop it

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
So here's the thing

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Then the biggest news

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
By far the biggest news

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Out of X018

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
In my opinion

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Two more studio acquisitions

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
So do you remember how the big news coming out of E3

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Was that Microsoft acquired like what

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Like five or six at E3

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Guess what, now they've got two more

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
So they have acquired

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Nxile Entertainment

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
And Obsidian

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
That's a pretty big deal, especially when it comes to RPGs

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
So they are definitely

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Getting their chess pieces in a row

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
For whatever Xbox One

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Successor is, Nxbox if you will

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I don't think you're gonna see

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Any huge announcements from these companies

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Right away, but I definitely

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Think Microsoft is positioning the chess pieces

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
So that when they announce Nxbox

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
I really think they're just gonna be like

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
And we're gonna have

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
This game, and this game

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
And this game, and this game

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
And this game, and they're gonna go

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Like all through their studios

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
And I really think that's an E3 that's coming

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Is when Microsoft is gonna be like

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Not only are we putting out this system

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
But game from this in-house

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Game from this in-house, game, game

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Game, game, and they're gonna

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Really try to

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
One up the hell out of Sony

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
And whatever they've got in store for Playstation 5

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Hoping and praying that Sony

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Isn't cooking up as many

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Exclusives of their own

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Because I mean track record though

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Sony does release some big exclusives

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
I mean

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
If Microsoft can time it to get like

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
All six or seven of their studios

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
To like put out

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
One game every other month for an entire

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Year, that's gonna be really fucking

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Impressive

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Do you think that's the direction Microsoft's headed in?

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Cause I sure do

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
I think the system's lacking

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Exclusives

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
And so that's gonna help

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
I mean that's really

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
The only piece of the puzzle I think

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
That they're missing, that and

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Japan but you know

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Akuma JP in chat says and again

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Microsoft is buying their way out

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Well, money talks

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
That's what companies do though

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
That's what they do, how else are they gonna get exclusives

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
If they really

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Cause there's a part of me as well that still goes

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Microsoft still feels like they're writing off Japan

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
If Microsoft really

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Wanted to turn some heads

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
They'd fucking buy Capcom, Konami

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Namco Bandai

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Like one of the big

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Well actually I would be totally okay with Microsoft

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Like honestly, I'm gonna make the case right here

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
And y'all are gonna disagree, I don't give a fuck

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I think the way to save Konami

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
At this point is for Microsoft to buy it

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
And I think that would be a wonderful thing

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
I would love to see Microsoft buy Konami

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
You can send those hate mail

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
To Rob Roberts, care of Orange Launch Radio

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
But let's be real, y'all hate Konami's management

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
You all hate Konami's management

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
So why not

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Get rid of them and replace them

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
With Microsoft's management

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Which some of you are probably thinking

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
God, that would be even worse

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Is it right now?

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I don't know, Microsoft's management is in a much better place

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Much, much better place

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
With the Xbox One than it was

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
When good old Don Mattrick was unveiling it

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Sports, sports, sports, TV, TV, TV

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
So

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I would kind of love

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Now, I'm sure

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
It's a little more complicated

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Because Konami has their arcade

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Division, Konami has the

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Casino stuff, which is all really big too

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Speaking of which

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Maybe there's a way that they only buy a case set

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Speaking of which, was it

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
According to the 20th anniversary

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
DDR thing, supposed to be announcing

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
New game next week

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Or in a couple weeks

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
In time to 20 November, probably

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Yeah, probably time to 20 November

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
If Microsoft really wanted to do something big

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
They'd buy Nintendo

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
You can't buy Nintendo

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
No, you can't buy Nintendo

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Nintendo has way too much cash on hand

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Even after the Wii U

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Kind of did not live up to expectations

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
It doesn't matter, Nintendo is swimming in money

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
After the Wii

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
I'm just

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Like, yeah, I'm just

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Being fan wank completely

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
It's not as easy as Microsoft

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
There's a strategic partnership with Nintendo

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Where they take care of their online

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
And then Nintendo can make some games for them

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
She Hulk in chat

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Says Microsoft should buy Nintendo

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
There it is, or Bill Gates should

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
And then we can play Gears of War on the Switch

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I just, again

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Although, in theory, you would think

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Microsoft has endless, endless amounts of cash

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
So does Nintendo

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
So it makes them very difficult to buy

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
In that regard

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
But, again

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
I think a region like Konami's home computing division

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Is not where it used to be

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
And I think is really ripe for the pickin'

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Whoever releases the next Ridge Racer

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Is gonna be the winner

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
It comes down to

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
We need a new Ridge Racer game

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Uh

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Go ahead

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Sorry, this is a great comment from Dungeon Buster

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Live.vognetware.com

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
They're building up their backlot

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
The way Netflix is gobbling indie filmmakers

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
That is an awesome comparison, in my opinion

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Yeah, unfortunately they don't release several

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
New seasons of some shows

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
That I really like that are indie filmmakers

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
As well, but

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
What are you gonna do?

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Hey, it could be worse

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
They could be buying EA or buying games

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Or they could be like EA buying game companies

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
And then sucking them dry and then

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Throwing them away

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
You know what though, Netflix is the company that brought us

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Chris Pine's dick, so you know what?

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
All is forgiven

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Okay

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
I did see that Chris Pine was in something

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
So I will now not watch that

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Well, your wife's gonna make you

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
She's not gonna make me

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
She's gonna give a shit about Chris Pine's dick

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
No, I was gonna say

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
SSG100Matt says

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Never thought we'd talk about that tonight

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
No, I was gonna say

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
One game that I'm surprised we haven't seen Nintendo

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Put out yet

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
They have new games out in the arcade

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Cruisin, the Cruisin series

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Their latest one was a Cruisin

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Blast or whatever it was

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
That's a Nintendo game

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
In the arcade

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
They should put that on console

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
Why not?

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
They should

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Well, they should make some other racing games too

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
But you know

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Okay, for everybody in chat that's like

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
I don't wanna see that movie

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
I'm sure there's lots of titties as well

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
I haven't watched the movie myself

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
And let's be real, I'm not gonna watch the movie

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
I barely have time to play video games anymore

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
This is what the internet's for

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
The internet will screen capture that shit

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Are you saying the internet is for porn?

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
I'm saying the internet is for

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Finding things without having to suffer

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Through the rest of it

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Yeah, that reminds me what Akuma said

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Whatever happened to the supposed Ridge Racer sequel?

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Well, there was the one that was on PC

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Yeah

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Alright, let's move home with some more stories

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Going on to Loki

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Alright

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
And apparently with the Fallout

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
PC beta going on

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
People have already developed

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Mods for it

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
So they have a mod called Hairspray

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Which allows you to customize the hair color

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Of your vault dweller

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Beyond what is available in the game

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Of course, this being

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
An online game

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
The only person that's gonna see that is you

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
So it doesn't matter

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
No one's gonna actually see that

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
But apparently

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
You know, there's other

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Mods available

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Like for example, there's one that has

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
There's been actually several different Bethesda games

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
But a lock picking bar

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
So it shows you the sweet spot

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
For picking a lock

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Which allows you to pick a lock pretty easy

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Without wasting too many value pins

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
But I'm guessing

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
That maybe they're gonna be

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Patching the mount once the game comes out

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Then again, who knows

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
But

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
What's ridiculous though, speaking of patching

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Fallout 76

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Is gonna be getting a day one patch

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
That's actually larger than the game itself

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
So

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
The game

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
I think right now is

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
About

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Like 45 gigs

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
And the day one patch is gonna be

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
54.64 gigabytes

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Which is ridiculous

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Goodbye bandwidth cap

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Are we sure it's not like a patch that just bridges

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
The gap between what's on the disk

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
And maybe just a few gigabytes

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Of the differences between

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
That sounds like insane to me

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I don't know

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
But it's pretty bad

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
That they have a patch that big

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
And I don't know what they're gonna be doing

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I mean aside, they said a large number of bug fixes

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
enhancements

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Feature changes

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
And

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
I don't know

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
So we'll see

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
And apparently they're working on

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
You know, fighting off some

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Hacking exploits

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
I don't think

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
That much of what they're gonna do

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Is gonna have any effect on that

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
I think it's gonna be a big ol' mess

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
I'll wait and see because it's not a game

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
I'm planning on picking up

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Alright, I don't really

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Super get into the Fallout series

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
It's just one of those things

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I don't like the fact that it's an online game

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I'm kinda tired of that

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
I like Fallout being just like

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Even like it was Skyrim

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
And that's kind of ironic because Skyrim

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
I would like that to be a multiplayer game

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
That'd be fun

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
But it'd be fun just as in co-op

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Like I wanna play co-op with somebody

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
And play through Skyrim

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
That would be fun

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Kill me and nuke my shit

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
No, that's not really

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Entertaining for me

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I don't know

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Alright, well earlier in the show I brought up Mass Effect

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
And what could be in the future of the franchise

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And this past week we had

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
N7 Day, I don't know if y'all know that

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
But N7, which is kind of the name of the

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Special Forces unit in Mass Effect

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Is usually celebrated November 7th

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
And historically

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Bioware used to do some big reveals

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And announcements on N7 Day

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
They've been down the past few years

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Especially now that Andromeda's been out or what have you

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
But they did come out

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And say that on Bioware's official

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Twitter they basically said

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
They did this whole thing with the memories

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
What the series means to them and all that

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
And also they did kinda stealth announce

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
That an Xbox One X patch

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
For Mass Effect Andromeda

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Did go live

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
So you get some 4K enhancements

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
But if I remember right, Playstation Pro

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Kinda had those already

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
But this would bring it in parody

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
With Playstation Pro and probably some of the same stuff

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
That's in the PC version anyway

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
But still cool

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
It's nice for the people that are playing

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
On the Xbox One that they get that

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I guess it's better resolution

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And HDR lighting, so probably just some of the same stuff

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
From PC to be honest

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
But anyway, Casey Hudson

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Who's now the general manager of Bioware

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
But of course he was a big part of the original trilogy

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
He basically

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Did kinda come out and say

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
That

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
The tweet text

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Or whatever says that

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
And Hudson talked about this saying that

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
There's future Bioware games in Mass Effect

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
In the Dragon Age series

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
So Mass Effect is not dead

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
There will be no

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Killing of the franchise

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
The quote that he said

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
It means coming into the studio every day

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Dreaming about what the next great Mass Effect game

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Will be

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
So I guess they'll revisit it at some point in the future

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
But I'm still not pre-ordering Anthem

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
EA

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
The way you treated Mass Effect's Andromeda

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I'm not gonna be jumping up support

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Anthem, so good luck

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Good luck y'all

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Just to give you hope on how EA is treating things

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Isn't there like N7 armor available

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
In Anthem or something? I heard about that

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
No, I'm sure that's gonna be a thing

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
But I was just gonna mention since it's not on our show roll

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
You know there's a game called Battlefield 5

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
That's coming out

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I've heard of this game

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
But

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Oh god, it's the whole thing where it's like 3 weeks early

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Or something like that

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
But if you subscribe to their PC service

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
That allows you to do all these games

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
You get it like 10 days earlier

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Oh, but if you order like the

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Premium edition or whatever

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Then you get a few days after that

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
And then if you

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Get just the base game

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Well you're gonna have to wait until the 20th

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Or whatever it is

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Well, I hope EA has a 100%

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Quality product on their hands

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Because when that does release early

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
The internet is gonna fucking tear it apart

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Just like they did with Mass Effect Andromeda

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
And if the slightest thing is wrong with that game

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
It will be under a microscope

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Just like it was with Mass Effect Andromeda

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
And basically what I'm saying is EA

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
You should've learned your fucking lesson already

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Or Battlefront 2

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I feel bad for the developers

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I'm gonna leave it at that

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I hope the game is 100%

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
100.00%

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Quality

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Because any flaw in that is going to be under a microscope

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
And then you're gonna get those fucking tweets

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
That are like, I cancelled my pre-order

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Because you fucking flopped this in Battlefield

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I guess EA kind of forgot

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
That like, the first week sales

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Of a game is really important

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
And I'm sorry, all of these people

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Are not gonna suddenly shell out twice as much

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Money to play it three weeks early

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
It's ridiculous

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
It is though

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Anyway

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Rob was about to go on a Loki style rant

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And Loki interrupts it to defuse it

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I'm the only one who rants here, bitch

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I don't think that's what you said

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I didn't really have the full on rant

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I said what I needed to say

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
We'll just leave it at that

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Alright, let's move on

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
So Sony's got this

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Playstation classic that's gonna be coming out

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
On December 3rd for $100

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And of course they announced all their games with that

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
And now with different websites

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Kind of showing little previews

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
On how it looks

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
We get to see what exactly we're getting

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
For $100

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Well apparently the console is gonna be using

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Standard USB controllers

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
So the, you know, non-dual

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Shock Playstation controllers

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
So that's at least cool because maybe you can use that

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
On your PC and stuff

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
The other thing that's kind of interesting is that

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
It's running an open source Playstation emulator

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Called PCSX Re-Armed

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
So

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
They're using basically just a PC emulator

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
On this console

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
To emulate these games

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Which begs the question

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Why do I even want to buy this then?

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Because it's cute

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
It's not though

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
And they have like games from, it seems like from different

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Regions as well, like they have the European

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Version of

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Let's see

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
It says, yeah they said a lot of the games that they

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Booted up on the Playstation classic were in the European

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Version, so like Final Fantasy 7

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
For example

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Then also like

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Grand Theft Auto

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Yeah they're like

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Click on a UK flag to display

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
The text in English

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
I wonder though if that's not necessarily so much

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
That's a European version of the game

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Or if it's because DMA Designs at the time

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Was a European company

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
So, you know, it would make sense that they would have a

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
European flag on there

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I just don't know like

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
It wouldn't be the first time I've seen the English

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Language represented by that flag

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
It's not like something to be

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
It's not a news worthy

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Piece of news in my opinion

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
The thought is because the fact that it runs

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
This emulator is probably why there's such

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
A limited

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Support for

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
There's a limited amount of games on here because

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
The games supported by the emulator

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Aren't necessarily like the vast library

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Also they're saying that

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Some of the games like Ridge Racer Type 4

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
It has this like blurry

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Dither defect on the text

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Which probably looked good on a normal

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
TV which I remember it looking fantastic

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
On my old TV because I had a little 13

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
CRT but now

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Looks really blurry

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
And hard to read which yes that's how it

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Looks like on my computer so

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Interesting I don't know

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
So you might want to

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Cautiously wait for this

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I think it's neat

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
But

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Do I really need another thing I could put

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
NES games on?

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I don't really

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Bobby in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
The C64 Mini runs Vice

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
This is a popular thing to just have these

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Minis running emulators

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
They want you to buy it because it's all packaged nicely

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
It's for people who are not tech

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Masters and don't already have the emulators themselves

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
He has a fair point

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
It's you know it's supposed to be that

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Attractive thing on the shelf that Grandma

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Is buying you for the Christmas tree

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And I get that and that's why the SNES

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Classic and the

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
NES Classic are fantastic because

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Those games look great when it's upscaled

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
On a TV

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I gotta say though this is kind of the

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Awkward generation the Nintendo 64

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And Playstation 1

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
It doesn't hold up as well

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
The Nintendo 64 might be a little bit

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Better because

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Mario 64 is a great game

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
But man

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It's rough

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
It's rough to look at

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Maybe like the Playstation 2 classic emulator

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Whenever that comes out someday

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Maybe I'll be on board with that

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Only if it has Magic Pen Gel

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Magic Pen Gel

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Hell yes

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
And I don't know

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Even the Japanese game lineup was way better too

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I want an armored core

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
God dammit

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Alright well I know one

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Game that

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Bobby Blackwolf says

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Playstation 3 classic has Eye of Judgment

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Then it can be a million seller

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Oh that's

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Wouldn't that be great if all these years later

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
The Playstation Eye

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
They finally sell a million copies of Eye of Judgment

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And by the time you're 50 years old

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
You have to dress up like Tingle

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Motherfuckers

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Alright

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I bet there's so many people that listen

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Well there's not a lot of people that listen to OLR

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
But I bet there's enough now

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
They probably don't even know what that joke was

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So we made this bet

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
When the Playstation Eye was first announced

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
So it was a long time ago

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
What were we calling it? The Brown Eye of Judgment or something like that?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
No it's because they had this game

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
We saw it at E3

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
We went to E3 and we saw it through a demonstration

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
They're playing cards

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
They're playing a card game and I'm like

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I don't fucking understand why I need to buy this

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
To play this stupid card game

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Just play the card game

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Why do I need to see the TV?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
So Loki took a bet and the bet was

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And he said if they sell a million copies of Eye of Judgment

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
He would dress up as Tingle

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
For the webcam that we had at the time

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
And come to the show

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
The closest we ever got was

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
One holiday, one Halloween

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
You came dressed up as Sackboy

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
From Little Big Planet, remember that?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Yeah, I do remember that

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
He had a really fancy little Sackboy card

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
That was about as close as we got

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
But we wanted you to be Tingle

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Oh the other closest thing is that that Flappy

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I always forget about Flappy Vog, it's been so long now

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
There was also

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
It was

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
He was one of our old listeners

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
He works at a game company

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
That had a Kickstarter

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
And one of the

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Kickstarter things was like if you got

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I don't remember if it was likes

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Or random drawing

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Or donations or something like that

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Someone would draw you in a certain style

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
So I had the girl draw me

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Oh yes, I remember that

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And then there was

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I remember there was an episode

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
It was the last episode we ever did on Live 365

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Before we moved to All Games Radio

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
That was a long time ago, right?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
That was before Vog, right?

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So there was

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
We did a list list or something

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
What could Live 365 do to get us to stay

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
And I think one of the winning answers was

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Purchase one million copies of the High of Judgement

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
By the way

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Oh my god

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I love this

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
This is so, this is recursive right now

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
So I'm actually looking at the Orange Lounge Radio

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Wiki, because there is a wiki that

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
The fans have done

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I don't think I've ever edited an article

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I don't even think I know how

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
But there's actually a whole article

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
On the Orange Lounge Radio wiki

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.wiki.com

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
About the High of Judgement bet

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
On September 23, 2007

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Wow, that's old

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Loki exclaimed

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
That there would be no way that the High of Judgement

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Would sell any considerable amount of units

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Upon hearing this

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Rob in the chat room suggested

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
That they should start a bet with Loki

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Oh yeah, you want to take a bet on that?

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
The bet was that if the High of Judgement

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Could sell a considerable amount of units

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Loki would dress up as Tingle

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Loki accepted the bet and set the rules

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
The High of Judgement must sell one million

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Units in six months worldwide

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
This was later changed from

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Six months to all time, because then you got cocky

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Yeah

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
After the rules were set

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Rob suggested another condition

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
While dressed up as Tingle

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Loki would play an online match of

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Eye of Judgement with Bobby Blackwolf

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
And set the Playstation Eye on fire

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
In the middle of the match

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I don't even remember that, but that's awesome

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Kudos me

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And we would still totally do that

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I know

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I kind of feel like Loki would just

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Do that for free without the Tingle outfit

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Bobby, do you have a copy?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
On March 2, 2008

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
At 9pm, Loki changed the bet

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Once again

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
And combined the sales

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Requirement total with the game

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Let's Ride Friends Forever

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
For the bet

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
But then

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
On June 11, 2010

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
The bet was declared over

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Why did we do that?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Because I think it was never gonna, I don't know

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
On November 11, 2018

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
The bet was reopened

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Can we get on that please?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
On November 11, 2018

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
The bet was reopened

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Because now there might be a Playstation 3

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Classic some day

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
By the way, they even, God

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
You guys are so fucking awesome

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
The final results

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
304,769

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Plus

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
43,355 equals

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
348,124

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Note, VG charts did not have

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Any sales information on the European version

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Of Eye of Judgment

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Or sales information on any version

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Of Let's Ride Friends Forever that wasn't the DS

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Version

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Y'all fucking brought your receipts

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I'm so fucking proud, thank you Wiki people

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I'm checking right now

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
If there's

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
An actual copy of Eye of Judgment

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
For sale on eBay that I can

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Burn, oh hey, 1099

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
That's not bad

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Cuddlebucket in chat says

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
This scenario needs to have Dark Sakura in the background

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Looking disapprovingly

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Are you kidding? She'll be handing him the match

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I can get a

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Complete set, including a Playstation

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I can't because I don't know where the hell mine is

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
For 2699

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Wow

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Maybe we'll just do it

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
We'll be one more

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
We'll do a Twitch stream some day

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Loki almost

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Since it sold a third of the requirements

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Loki performs a third of the bet

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And there was the

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Eye of Judgment Legends which was on PSP

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I just don't think it ever sold

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
A significant amount of copies to count

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Ugh

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Alright

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
S2100Matt says it ended production

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was what

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Caused us to say it was done

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
But I'm sorry, that's not fun

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
To end it, so it's reopen

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
You just have to convince Sony

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
To do it again

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
What's the physical

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Game company that, you know, they'll make

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Physical copies of digital games

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
You just have to convince them to do it

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Oh, there you go, to make their own Eye of Judgment

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Throwback

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I love it, I love it

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Anyhow

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Let's move on

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
To one more story here

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
And it has to do with another very modern VR

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Game, and this game is a lot

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Of fun as well

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
It's not one you can just sit there on the couch and play

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
But it's still fun, it's a game called Beat Saber

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Excuse me, I had the hiccups

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
The game is called Beat Saber

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
And it's going to be coming out on the PlayStation 4

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
On November 20th

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Which made a lot of music fans

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Chuckle, because November 20th

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Is a date usually associated with Dance Dance Revolution

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Because there's a song

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
That, well actually it goes back to Beatmania

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Over and over again in the Bomani franchise

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Called 20 November, so

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
And there was even a 19 November

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
In one of the 2DX

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Didn't they do a 21 November at some point?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I feel like that was a thing in 2DX

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
At one point, I don't know

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I think you're thinking of September

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Maybe, I see what you did

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Alright anyway, so Beat Saber is going to be coming out

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
On November 20th, and of course

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
This is the game that you play in VR

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Where you slash beats that are coming at you

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Sometimes you have to duck

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Or move around

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
The manifestations of walls

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
And things like that

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
And this game is also a little bit controversial

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Because you're not just graded on

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Special performance, but you are graded on style

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
How much flourish do you have with your moves

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
So it'll be very interesting

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Also some features

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
There's supposed to be some extra PlayStation

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Exclusive tracks

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Like 5 PlayStation exclusive tracks

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
And there's going to be some brand new

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Campaign mode that wasn't originally in the PC version

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
But the makers of Beat Saber

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Have been working hard on the port

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I do believe they plan to go back to update the PC version

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
To have the campaign mode

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
I don't think it'll have the tracks, but modders

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Will take care of that certainly

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
I mean if they put the fucking B movie

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
In Beat Saber then they'll put these

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
5 missing songs in as well

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
You can all look for that on PC soon

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
But for PlayStation 4 people who don't have

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Oculus or HTC Vive

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
You can check that out on your PlayStation VR on November 20th

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I know I will be, because I

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Really enjoyed Beat Saber when I played it on Bobby's

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
HTC Vive when I was at Dragon Con

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Earlier this year

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Are you going to be looking into

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Getting the Beat Saber

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Maybe, I don't know

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
You should, if nothing else check it out

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Check it out over here

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
After I get it and see what you think

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
So there you go, by the way

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
The wiki has already been updated, somebody did put on there

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
On November 11th the bet was reopened

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Thank you, appreciate that

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
It won't matter

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
You're getting cocky over there Loki

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Getting cocky, alright

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
I guess it's time we go to the classic game of the week

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
What do you say? Sure

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And so we take

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
A step into that portal that's marked

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Radio Magic, and we end up

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
With the one and only Dark Sakura joining us

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
For the classic game of the week, hi Jamie

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Oh hi

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Hi, how are you doing?

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I'm okay

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
It's kind of

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Headachy with all the smoke outside

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Oh yeah, I'm sure we will have

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Addressed it in the show before this point

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
But the smoke here is like terrible

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And obviously the disaster that's going on out there

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Is really really terrible

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
The effect it's having on so so so

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Much of the state is crazy

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Yeah I saw

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
The pictures online just from downtown

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And that haze of brown was really

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Frightening, yeah it's like brown fog

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
But anyway on a somewhat

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Lighter note, something that we do

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
When it's smokey outside is we stay inside

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And we play lots of video games on a lazy

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Day, but once a week Dark Sakura

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Likes to find a game that she thinks, hey

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
You know what, you need to respect the classics

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Put down your newfangled Playstation VRs

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And pick up a classic

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
It's the classic game of the week

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Dark Sakura, what did you pick for this week's

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Classic game of the week

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Metal Gear

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Metal Gear

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I can't do the David Hayter voice

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Well and to be fair, David Hayter

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Did not voice Metal Gear on the

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
NES, which most people

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Are probably familiar with, although

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Not really where Metal Gear got its start

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Right?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Yeah, well actually it didn't even get its start on the NES

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Right

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Metal Gear first came out in 1987

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
For the MSX2 computer

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
In Japan and Europe

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
It is the

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Actually considered to be the

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Progenitor of the stealth genre

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
And it was the first video game

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Designed by Hideo Kojima

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Who went on to do all the later ones

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Well most of the later ones

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
The Metal Gear 2

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
That we got on

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
NES was not the real

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Metal Gear 2

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
He had nothing to do with it

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
The game, the original game

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Was reworked for the Famicom

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And then that was the one that got

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Internationally released and it was developed

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Without Kojima and had

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Some drastically altered level

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Designs and a bunch of changes

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
There's a more faithful port

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Of the MSX2 version that came out

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Metal Gear Solid 3

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Subsistent to Playstation 2

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
And the HD edition that came out

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
The PS3, Xbox 360, and PlayStation V

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
They also had

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
A revised translation

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I really want to play that version someday

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
I have never played that version

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I loved Metal Gear NES as a kid

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
And of course as a kid you don't realize how butchered the game was

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
From its MSX version

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
So I really want to play this

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Other remake someday

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
I can lend it to you

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Sweet

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
The game itself

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
It revolves around a fallen snake

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Foxhound

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Who's on a solo infiltration mission

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
To go into the state of Outer Heaven

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And destroy Metal Gear

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Which is a bipedal walking tank

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
It can launch nuclear missiles

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Anywhere

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
And so that's bad

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
So you play around with the snake

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
And you have different modes

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
And one of them is the alert mode

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Where the enemies

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
See where you are

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
So basically a snake is seen and there's only

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Exclamation point over the enemy

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Then

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Only the enemies on the present screen

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Will attack and you can just avoid them

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
By going to the other screen

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
But if two exclamation marks appear

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Then they trigger an alarm

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
That brings in reinforcements

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Which you can escape from

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
By killing all of the enemies

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Or going outdoors or entering an elevator

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
You start the mission unarmed

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
So you can get

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
You know, it's on-site procurement

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
All of the things that you need

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
While you're going through there

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
You also have limited ammo

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
You have to find ammo caches

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Or stealing from other people

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
You can also get a suppressor

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
That can allow you to use a handgun

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
And some machine gun without making a noise

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Some weapons are used

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
To clear obstacles

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Like having hollow walls

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
And electrified floors

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
You can also punch people in the face

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Which is awesome

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
So you can also defeat

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
A guard by punching him in the back

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Which is, I guess, the back-end

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Version of the strangle that we had

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
In the later games

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
And then you also get

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Different mercenaries who will

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Challenge you when they're at the boss characters

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
In each level

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
So you also got multiple floors

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
And multiple places around here

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Really the PlayStation remake

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Really did a good job

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Of bringing in that

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
That vastness that you felt in the first game

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
You also get a transceiver

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
That you can use to talk to

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Your commanding officer

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Big boss

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Or other members of the resistance

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Such as Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Each of his allies

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Gives them certain

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Tips

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
They specialize in different subjects

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Although you don't always get a reply

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
When you talk to them

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
The MSX2 version

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
They used a tape recorder

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
To save your game progress

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Or a Game Master 2 cartridge

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
That you would save via floppy disk

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Later on, they were all stored locally

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Like on memory cards and describes

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
So

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
You have different

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Your bosses include Shoot Gunner

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Who is renamed Shot Maker

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Who is a Spetsnaz agent

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Machine Gun Kid

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Fire Trooper

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Coward Duck

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Arnold

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Bloody Brad

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
And a couple of androids

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
And another mercenary

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
From Outer Heaven

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Who you don't find out until the end

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
So really

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
It was just a pretty amazing game

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I mean, it was

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Kazuma was actually asked to take over the project

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
And it was supposed to be an action game

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
With modern military combat

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
But the MSX was really limited

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
In what it could do

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
So inspired by The Great Escape

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
He reversed it

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
To focus

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
To avoiding capture

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
And so

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
That's where the stealth aspect came in

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
The packaging

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Has Solid Snake holding a gun

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
And it was actually traced back

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
To a publicity still of Michael

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Bean posing as Kyle Reese for Terminator

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
And

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Kazuma didn't take the picture

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
But if you go back and look at it

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Even I think got the same art here in the US

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
But yeah

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
You can like, is that Michael Bean?

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Is that from Terminator?

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Even I thought that as a kid, you know

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
So

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
As far as different releases, we did have the

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
MSX2 version, we had the Famicom version

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Which was of course

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Completely altered

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
There was the MS-DOS and Commodore 64 version

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
They were based off the NES ones

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
And the MSX2 one

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
The subsistence

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Came out and it was the re-release

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Of the MSX2 one

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
That had an updated

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Version

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Original and easy difficulty settings

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Name changes for characters

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
A boss survival mode

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
That you get after clearing the game

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
A hidden bandana item

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
That gives you infinite ammo

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Enemy bosses

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
That flash red and white when they sustain damage

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Snake cigarettes, drain his life gauge

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Which they did in a later game

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Messages

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Are now displayed when the player

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Attempts to pick more rations and ammunition

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
After reaching maximum capacity

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And a result screen is added to the game

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
That rates your performance

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
It is actually

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Metal Gear was

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Actually one of the 20th best selling

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
MSX games in Japan for 5 months

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
And it debuted at number 4

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
And peaked at number 3

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
They said the game was rapidly

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Addicting

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
The NES version was also

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Rates number 104

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
In the best made Nintendo

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Games of their top 200

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
It led to

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Sequels, there was Snake's Revenge

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
For NES which wasn't really

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
In the thing

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Metal Gear Solid 2 Solid Snake

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Was developed by Kojima and released

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
In Japan for MSX2

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
The same year because we really

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Wanted more Metal Gear

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
And then of course

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Solid was the next one to come after that

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Which honestly

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
I mean it was a really really

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Great game. For different media

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
There were books that came out

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
There was a Metal Gear book

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
That was done by Scholastic Books for World of Power

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
There was a game book adaptation

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
In Japan

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
In the second installment of the Konami Game Book

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Series. It was set years after the

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Events of the game were followed because it called back

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Into Fox Town to do more

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Metal Gear shenanigans

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
There were the remakes

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
There's an official and an unofficial

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
There is a mod for Alien Swarm

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
That was created

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
By Konami with

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Permission as long as they didn't make

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
A profit but it was cancelled on June 3, 2014

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
And David Hader was supposed to

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Voice call a snake in it

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
And there's another fan remake

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
That's in development using Unreal Engine 4

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Called Outer Heaven

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
And there you go

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
That's out of gear

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Yeah this game obviously left quite a bit of a

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Legacy but yeah

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Seriously one of my all time favorites on the NES

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Which is weird because I never got

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
As into the later

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Metal Gear Solid series. I certainly don't have

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Anything against it. I just didn't really like

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Have the money

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
To buy or play the earlier games

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Then I just kind of fell behind on the series

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
It's one of those things I'm always like

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I'll have to get back to that on a rainy day at some point

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I just never have but the original

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
On the NES for me because again I knew no better

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
As a kid about MSX or any of that stuff

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Is just a true classic

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I didn't even know there was a Commodore 64 version

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Until you just mentioned it. That's crazy

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
I have to play that someday

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Well and the other thing too is that

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
You know there is Metal Gear Solid

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
From Bleed

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Oh yeah yeah yeah the whole Dreamcast

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Thing yeah

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
So if you want we can lend

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
You our Bleedcast version

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
That might be fun

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And the disc if you want to play through it

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
It might make a fun livestream at some point

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Well anyway there it is

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Your classic game of the week Metal Gear for the NES

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Dark Sakura

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
We're not going to be here next week of course

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Due to my trip out to Las Vegas

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
So that means this is the last show before the

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Thanksgiving holiday so I thought I'd

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Close out tonight by asking you

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
What are you thankful for Dark Sakura?

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Um

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Respirators

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Music

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Music

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Music

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Good old Dark Sakura thank you for joining us

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
How you can during this

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Time that she's got a work conflict

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Going on here. Anyway I'm back here

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
With Loki and it was brought up in chat

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
While we were listening to Jamie's segment there

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
It was brought up in chat that

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
We had not discussed Pokemon Go

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
During our gaming weeks like a first

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
But you

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Okay so I'm sure you did too

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Pokemon Go community day happened

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I went to a new place

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Because of all the smoke outside we went to the mall

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Instead of the capital where we used to go

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
We went to a big mall out in Roseville

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
And actually it worked out really well

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Yeah I have spotty GPS in there usually

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
It did bounce around

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
And that made it very frustrating when we tried to do

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Because there's a Sprint store in there and it's an

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
EX eligible gym

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Alan still didn't have Giratina the legacy raid

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
So one popped on that gym during

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Community day and I was bouncing all around

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
It was really frustrating but we finally got it

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
He got his Giratina and now

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
We're also potentially eligible for an

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
EX raid out there next time

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Deoxys passes go out so we'll see

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
I mean if they do it during the week

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
There's no way I can go out there but Alan

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Might be able to go and get his Deoxys

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
So we'll see

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I didn't necessarily just want to talk about Pokemon Go

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Because another game that you and I have spent

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
An awful lot of time playing, Ingress

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Went through some big changes this week as well

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
We didn't even really address that at the top of the show

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Especially because I don't think either one of us are huge fans

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Of the changes but Loki why don't you

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Tell us what's going on with Ingress and what you think

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
So

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Basically they released

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
The app called Ingress Prime

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Which is the new

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Version of the Ingress

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Client I guess

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
They redeveloped the whole thing in Unity

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
So they remade it from scratch

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
So it looks fancier now but everything is rearranged

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
And I don't know if it's necessarily easier to use

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I find it's not easier to use

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
But that's because I'm used to the old app

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Yeah the muscle memory takes a long

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Time to change but people who are new to it

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Will probably be like oh this is fancy

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
You know can do that. Recharging is

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Certainly a hell of a lot easier I'll give them that

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Yeah so there's some things that are

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
There's an advantage too but

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
So like I don't know

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
I've just been having some issues with it

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Because like I

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Decided to get the redacted app as well

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Which the redacted app is the old app

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
It's just kind of like in

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
So they upgraded the old app

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Automatically to the new version

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
But then Niantic also said because we know the new version

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Some of you are going to have some problems getting used to it

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
It may be buggy and stuff like that

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
We're going to release this new thing called Scanner Redacted

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Which is the 1.0 app

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
But you can only use Scanner Redacted

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
If you had an account already

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
And then on top of all that

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
On top of all that because people are like

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
New Scanner, I don't know about that

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
They also in their store

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
That they've always had a store where you could

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Just like you know this fake money

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
And you usually buy portal frackers with it

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Which allows you to get double the

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Output of when you hack a portal

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Or you can get like little beacons and stuff

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
It's just crap that you put above it

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
You can bling out your

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Portal or whatever

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Sorry I have to respond to this comment in chat

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Over at alive.vognetware.com

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Sounds like old guys bitching

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Isn't that like any gaming podcast?

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Yes we are old guys

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
What's the problem?

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
To be fair he didn't say it was a problem

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
He just said it sounds like old guys bitching

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Yes we're old guys bitching

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Continue your bitching

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Here's the other thing though

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
It's kind of like they've been having some issues

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
With the new scanner

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
For example I

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Just out of the whim

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Just went ahead and checked out

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Oh hey let's see what this looks like

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
So I pulled up the

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Redacted scanner

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
And took a look at my area

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I'm like hey there's some fields here

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And I put the new scanner in

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And I'm like wait a second I don't see some of these fields

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
What the hell

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
And so I took screenshots of that

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
And there's definitely a discrepancy between that

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Oh and then they have like in their store

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Like I said where you can buy the portal frackers

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
And stuff like that which that wasn't a big deal

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Because it didn't really change the game too much

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Oh now you can buy

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Gear in the store

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Now granted

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I don't know if they've dropped down like

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
The levels but like the gear that you can buy now

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Is level 6 gear

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
And not you know level 8

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Or level 7 or whatever it was

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
People were very mad about that that's for sure

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
So I don't know

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
But it's still there

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Whether it's a limited amount of time

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Or whatever but I

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
I would just like the game to be as snappy

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
As the old one like I don't know about you

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
But like when I go to make a link it is so

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Slow

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Like it takes forever

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I love like when you actually make the link

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
And I love how it shows what it will look like

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Like there are improvements that I really like

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
But just like oh my god it's so slow

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
But you know the thing that they're teasing us

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Because you know I just hit max level in Ingress over the summer

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
So you know what they're teasing us with now right

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
So they put in this

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
So the question was always going to be

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Is Ingress going to put in levels above 16

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
And it looks like the answer is no

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
What they are going to do is

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Recursion

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Recursive Ingress

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
So now that you know hooray

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
I spent four and a half years

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
To hit max level in Ingress

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
And Ingress is now like bitch you thought

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Now you can Recurse and go all the way back to level 1

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
And it's like prestige

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Right

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Basically they brought the prestige system into

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Ingress

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
So I'm going to do it

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
But it's just

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Like a lot of people on my team are doing it

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
And I was kind of sitting there going

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I don't think this is a good idea

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
For the entire team to reset

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
To level 1 at the same time

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
So I'm going to wait a little bit

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Until some of you get up in level

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
And in case any gigantic

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Blue fields go up over town

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Like somebody can

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Respond to it

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Because I didn't think it was perhaps the greatest idea

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
For the entire team to Recurse all at once

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
But that's exactly what happened which kind of cracked me up

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
I think they should all Recurse

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Well eventually they probably will

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
So

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Siya Tabiri says Ingress new game plus

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
That's kind of what it is

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Kind of what a new game plus

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
So anyway

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Yeah the Ingress Prime

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Client is just bugging me right now

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
But like I'm excited what it will look like in 3 months

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Once they've been able to bug fix it

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Because clearly

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
God this thing has been in development for a while

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
And clearly whatever beta they had wasn't enough to bug fix it

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
So it'll be, it's weird too

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
They're taking all their bug feedback through

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Reddit

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
So you can go to reddit.com

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Slash r slash Ingress Prime feedback

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
And that's like the unofficial

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
But official Ingress Prime feedback forum

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
It's weird

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Anyway, alright we'll stop bitching

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
About a mobile phone game and we'll get

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Back into some rapid fire news

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Loki, what do you want to talk about for rapid fire news tonight?

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Alright well this is kind of a cool

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Freebie with the whole announcement

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Of the release date of Crackdown 3

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Microsoft is giving away

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Crackdown, free for this month

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
So go download it

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Or go add it to your library even though I

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Already have it

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
But you can do it

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Anyways

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
So go do it

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
If you don't already, it's a fun game

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Find those orbs

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
And then of course

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
With no

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
PlayStation event around the corner

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
We have to look forward to of course

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
The Game Awards 2018

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
That's the largest lineup of new game

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Announcements in the show's history

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Which they had a lot of announcements

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Before so I'm curious to see what they're

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Going to show off this year

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
It's going to take place 6th of

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
December

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
So we'll have to find out

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
What's going to be there, obviously

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Kojima's going to be there in print

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Well the fact that they don't have a PlayStation

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Experience this year kind of means I think

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Some of those announcements will roll over to this

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
So I think that's probably one reason why they're

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Having a really good year for announcements is because

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
There's no PlayStation experience

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
And then

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Microsoft didn't really like

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Bring the house down with anything

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Besides the studio acquisitions

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
They announced that X018

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Was a big deal but they didn't really do

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Any new game announcements so even

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Out of Microsoft's camp they might have

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Something in store for Game Rewards which could be interesting

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
And the Game Awards they said the

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Cut off is going to be

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Mid November

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I'm like well yeah

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Smash comes out like a couple of days before

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Yeah no it sucks but Smash is not

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Going to be eligible but Tetris Effect is

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
I'm just saying

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
We all know Red Red Redemption and God of War

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Is going to win everything anyway but I hope

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Tetris Effect gets like

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Is there a category for pretty?

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
There's music

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Yeah it seems like a shoo-in for music that's for sure

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Alright well heading

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Over to the Nintendo Switch

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
And it's online system

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Of course the Nintendo Switch online

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
That's something they're updating monthly with

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
New games so November's

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Games are on their way they will be out on

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
November 14th and that is when

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Twinbee, Mighty Bomb Jack

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
And Metroid will be released that is what

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Nintendo announced the specific day for that this week

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Obviously I know I'm very excited about

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Metroid. Mighty Bomb Jack

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
In my opinion was kind of garbage

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Especially compared to the original Bomb Jack

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Arcade game. Twinbee is

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
A very interesting pick because we got that

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Here in the US is Stinger

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
But my understanding is we are getting

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Twinbee so it's going to be like the Japanese

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Version basically

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
No word yet if there might be a bonus

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Thing because Nintendo did

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
No announcement or ramp up

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
For that Zelda

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
What the hell did they call it? The Zelda

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
You can buy everything now or whatever the hell

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
It was called. Zelda Easy Mode

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Basically so it would be interesting

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Maybe if Metroid gets something like that or maybe

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
One of the other games that already exist

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
They should totally I mean I know

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
It's so against you know their

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I don't know

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Mantra but they should totally

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Put Game Genie support back in those games

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Because that would be awesome

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I know that Game Genie

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Wasn't necessarily

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Their thing but I mean

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
It would be nice

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Twinbee was never released in the US I thought it was

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Stinger

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
I thought they renamed it and put it out here

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
They probably changed it a bit too

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
In Light Force or something

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Oh OrangeRite says Stinger was Twinbee

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Too oh my bad I thought that's how

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
It worked okay thank you OrangeRite

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Alright

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Anyhow other news out of

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000

Starting actually this past weekend

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Was a chance for you to go

Check out Super Smash Brothers Ultimate

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000

Some locations include

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
The mall of Georgia

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
To us and I'm not

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Going to go out there to stand

All fucking day to play like one match

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000

Even though that's been out for a little bit

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
I'm sure Nintendo would love to see that show up

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Under lots of Christmas trees

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And menorahs everywhere

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Yeah it's true

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Going in chat over at

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Talking about that mall says

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
That's where I used to play Drummania in the early 2000's

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
They had a Percussions Freaks 4th

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Mix at the Vans Skatepark

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I was the guy playing that

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
While everyone else was playing DDR

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I had all the high scores there

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
And you turned that into actual

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Drumming

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
I'm sure it had

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Nothing to do with your actual drumming experience

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Lending itself very well to

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Drummania or Percussion Freaks as the case may be

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Alright anyhow let's move

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
On to release dates and travel

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Around the world and check out what is coming out

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
This week in stores and I imagine

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
There might be a little bit this week

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Going up towards Black Friday

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000

Sorry that does not count towards the

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Does not count towards the bet

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000

Monkey King Master of Clouds

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
On PlayStation 4

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Then let's see

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
We got Trailblazers for Nintendo Switch

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
On the Nintendo Switch

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Alright

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Well then we'll travel to Japan

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
And check out some releases coming out over there

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Even though of course the shopping seasons are not

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Quite the same over there

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
But I do believe they have some releases

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
This week in Japan, yes on the PlayStation 4

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Yuna and the Haunted Hot Springs

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Steam Dungeon

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
That is in a

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Regular and a limited edition

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Just so we're clear

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
What's in the limited edition?

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Limited Things

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
What's the dungeon crawler?

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Actually you're exactly right

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
It is a dungeon crawler

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
So it's not just a clever name

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
It looks like it might be cute

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
But I doubt it will ever come out over here

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
RPG Maker MV Trinity

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Is out in Japan this week

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
On November 15th

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
As is Hitman 2's Japanese release

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
And Fallout 76 is getting a Japanese release

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
So you can look forward to all of that this week

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
That is the PlayStation 4

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
I'm checking out the Nintendo Switch real quick

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Sports Party

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000

Is a price reduced game this week

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
So it kind of gets a price reduction this week

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
And then the Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
As well as the Monster Ball Plus

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Accessory as they're calling it there

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Lots of little accessories

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
The GameCube controller

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Adapter and stuff comes out this week as well

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
If you want to get that in Japan

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
And the

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
RPG Maker MV Trinity

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Is also out on the Nintendo Switch this week

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
For those of you who want to design on the go

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
How about Europe, Loki?

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Alright, so in Europe we have

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
The Spyro Reignited Trilogy

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
That's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000

On PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
A game called

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Word Hunters

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
On the PlayStation 4

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
We have

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Let's Deal With It on PS4

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
On PlayStation 4

The Battlefield 5 Deluxe Edition

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
With early access

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Cause you gotta pay for that early access

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
That's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
And then of course

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
We have Pokemon Let's Go

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Eevee and Pikachu

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
That's gonna be on

The Hunt Championship Edition on the Switch

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
And

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Quite a bit more still

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
The Sims 4 Get Famous on PC

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
We have

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
The Witcher 3

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Dark Souls 3 Bundle

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
On PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Bats Pro Shops

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
The Strike Championship Edition

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
That's on the Switch

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
And then of course

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
You know, go along with the Pokemon

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Let's Go, they have the console bundles

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And the Pokemon Pokeball Plus

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
The Fortnite Deep Freeze Bundle

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
On PlayStation 4, Xbox One

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
And the Switch

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And that's it

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Okay, busy week

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
But I mean, it is that time of year, right?

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
It's also actually a busy week in our mailbag

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Very excited, you know, sometimes

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Sometimes I'm sitting here going, no emails

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Womp womp

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
It was because of the RuPaul Drag Race talk

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
They did it, it did the trick

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I guilted, no we got a lot of emails tonight

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I'm actually thrilled, so we have a lot of stuff to talk about

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
We have four emails, for us

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
For us, that is an avalanche, I'm excited

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
So let's get into it

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
You can always send us an email, participate at

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Orangeloungeradio.com

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
First email tonight from Martin

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Our friendly neighborhood, Belgian

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
And it's going to be talking about a subject

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
That we've already discussed a little bit tonight

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
But let's get Martin's take on it

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
So hello LR, your friendly Belgian Martin here

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Just wanted to talk to you about

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
EA's Battlefield 5 release date shenanigans

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
The following is what release schedule looks like

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
EA Access basic subscribers

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
For $5 a month

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Get to play 10 hour trial

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
From November 9

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
EA Access premier subscribers

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
For $15 a month get to play the full game November 9

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Pre-orders of the deluxe edition

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
$80 get to play November 15

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Regular people who just buy the game

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
$60 get to play November 20

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
So let me get this straight

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I paid $60 for the basic version of the game

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
And I have to wait almost two weeks

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
After release to play

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Even if you've pre-ordered the deluxe version of the game

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
For $80 you still have to wait a week

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Sure they call it early access for origin subscribers

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
But let's face it

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
The game is finished, it's out

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
They're just delaying release

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Unless you pay up more money

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
I find it very obnoxious

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
And I believe it harms the player base in the long run

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Keep up the great show, take care

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Martin from Belgium

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Thank you so much for the email as always

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
This has been something they've been doing for a while

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Granted this is a little worse

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
But before they had the whole EA

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Access thing with

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
The consoles where they would allow you

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
To play the game a few days earlier

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Before release

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Martin here's my opinion straight up

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
This system killed

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Mass Effect Andromeda

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
So why EA is still doing it

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Is beyond me

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
And I say it killed Mass Effect Andromeda

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Because when they put it out on early access

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
That's when suddenly it was like

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Oh my god look at all these graphical bugs

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
When in reality the graphical bugs

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Were like honestly it wasn't

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
It was probably better than most Bethesda games

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
But Bethesda doesn't do this

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
The problem is they take those

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
They take those micro clips

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Those seconds

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
And it's look at what a garbage game

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Mass Effect Andromeda is

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
And it ruined it

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
And it was because of this fuckery

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
So why EA is continuing to do it

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Kind of blows my fucking mind

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
But I guess Battlefield

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Is a very different type of game

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
And as I kind of referenced earlier in the show

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
If they have 100% confidence

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
That Twitter isn't going to be filled with all these

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Hot takes on fuck ups in the game

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Then I guess they can get away with it

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
But at the end of the day

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Money talks

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
So if you pay for it

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
They're going to do it again

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
It's only really an option

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
The origin thing is only an option if you're on PC anyway

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
So if you don't have a PC that can run these games

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Then you're kind of out of luck

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Unless you do just the EA

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
I don't even know if they're still doing their Game Pass type thing

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Does this open it up to piracy?

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
That's the other kind of thing

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
I'm surprised these games don't get ripped apart

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I assume there must be some component of the cloud

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
The online service

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
That's totally possible

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
I wouldn't probably say that

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
I mean, I know

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Hackers going to hack, right?

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
But I'm kind of surprised with the PC version

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
It doesn't open itself up to piracy

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
There must be enough of it that relies on the online piece

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
That you can't yank it off the EA access servers

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I wouldn't say that

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Because it's already on the torrent sites

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
So, uh, yeah

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
So, I would question EA's

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
I mean, I would never advocate for piracy

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
I'm not saying to pirate it

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
But I'm just surprised

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
That when that becomes a factor

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
That EA still kind of lets this happen

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Maybe they haven't cracked it yet

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
But they've got it out there

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
But let's be real guys

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
This could be a place the industry is headed

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
It's not unique to EA

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Microsoft just did it with Forza

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Did they not?

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
It's happened before

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
If you don't like it, don't buy it

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
I implore you, no matter what the game is

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
No matter what it is

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Now, let's go on to another email from Elliot B

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Who we haven't heard from in a while

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
It's very good to hear from you, Elliot

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Hey, OLR, I can't decide whether to get excited about Pokemon Go or not

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
I've bought almost every generation of Pokemon

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
I think he means Pokemon Let's Go

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Because that's where the rest of this email goes

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
I've bought almost every generation of Pokemon

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
All the way back to Blue

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
And sunk over 100 hours into Sapphire

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
But every game since

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
I get bored of the same old mechanics halfway through

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
I'm hoping that the Pokemon Let's Go games

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Add some fresh ideas

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
That don't just feel like throwaway novelties

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
What do you guys think?

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Will you pick it up?

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
I'm especially interested to hear Rob's opinion

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
As a dedicated Pokemon Go player

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Elliot B, thank you

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
And here's my opinion

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
I am really psyched about it

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
I'm jazzed about it, to play it

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Because in my opinion

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
The grind for hunting in the grass

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
For a particular Pokemon

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
And doing the random encounter battles

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Starts to feel really grindy

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
And that's where the Pokemon games start to lose me

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
I understand some people are really into that

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
And that's cool

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
But I do have that part of my brain that's like

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
No, you have to catch them all

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Before you move on, even as much as

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Shane and other Pokemon fans

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
That I know tell me, Rob, don't do that to yourself

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
You should just ruin the game for yourself

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
And I always inevitably ruin it for myself

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
So my point is, the fact that they've

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Replaced that kind of grinding

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
With a

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Ball tossing

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Kind of like different style that they've taken

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Out of Pokemon Go, the mobile game

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Yeah, that does seem really appealing to me

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Because they've taken out a lot of the grinding

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Well, and this will be my first traditional

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Pokemon game, because I only play Pokemon

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Technically, I mean

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
If we want to get technical, it is not part of the

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Mainline series, it is a side game

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
It's like a remake of the first

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
But you know if this sells well

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
We'll have Pokemon Let's Go

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
You know

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Espeon and Umbreon

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
You know, stuff from the second generation

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
So that'll be

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Inevitable

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Let's go Magikarp

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
I'm sure a lot of people will be into that

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Meanwhile, Shane is buying both versions

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Oh, I'm sure

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
He has a man now, so I'm pretty sure

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
He's buying one for him and one for his man

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
And they can trade with each other

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Probably buying the two consoles too

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
At least one of them, I'm sure

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I don't know, I'll text him in a little bit if y'all

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Really want to know an update, but you can safely assume

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
He's buying more than one copy

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
I am only buying one copy

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
I got Let's Go Pikachu

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Because when I was kind of doing an informal

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Assessment on my Twitter feed, it seemed like everybody

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Was going Eevee

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
I don't know what the difference is aside from your starting Pokemon

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Is there really a big difference?

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Well, if it's like Red and Blue, there will be

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Pokemon that you can't catch

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
In one that you can in the other

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Like, I don't remember what Pokemon

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Didn't cross over

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
I want to say like Ekans

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
And, um

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Arbok were exclusive to one

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
And then like

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Paras might have been in the other

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
I don't remember, but there are certain Pokemon

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
That don't show up

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
If it's like Red and Blue, which is my assumption

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
But can I just take those from Pokemon Go

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
And just transfer them into the game or something like that?

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Well, you trade them, you trade them with friends

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
That was the whole thing

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
You had a friend with Pokemon Blue

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
And then you could trade them into your game

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Because either game had all the Pokemon in it

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Just like now that they're up to like

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Gen 7

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
And probably why these games take a while to work on

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Is that with the Pokemon Bank

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
You can get Pokemon all the way back

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
From the earliest gens

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
And import them into

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
The newest Pokemon Sun and Moon

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
And I'm sure the Pokemon Bank

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Will be supported by

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
The Switch Pokemon, which will be Gen 8

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Which will be the next mainline Pokemon game

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Assumably as next holiday

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
And this game is supposed to be like the holdover

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
This is the tied you over title

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Which is fine

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
I think it's a very interesting direction

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
I'm really hoping it's

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Yeah, I'm really hoping it's going to be good

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Some folks in chat reminding me

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Sia Tabiri says Bellsprout was exclusive to Blue

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Sia Tabiri says

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
I think Meowth was exclusive to Blue

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Some other comments in chat

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
S2100mat suggests

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Let's go Bidoof

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
No one can play that, are you kidding?

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
I love Bidoof

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I got more excited

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
On community day when those bunnyries

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Showed up, the little bunnies

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
The bunnies

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
When did they show up?

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
At the mall, they were just randomly

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Caught like three of them on just random pokestops

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
And I was more excited about that

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Yeah, I finally evolved one of those

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
And I got a shiny

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Whatever that thing was

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
I don't know, I didn't really need it

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
I didn't get my

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
My enlightened

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Pokemon, though

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
I got the stupid

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Ponyta that was shiny

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
But I didn't get a shiny Cubone

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
And I was very disappointed

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Because I have a horse named Smurf

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
I didn't get either one, sadly

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
But you get the shirts

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
If you look in the story

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
You do the shirts, that's cool

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Ponyta is shiny

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I hate that that's a resistance thing

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
It evolved it too

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
It dulls out even

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
I like the color better when it's a Ponyta

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
It still looks cool though

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
I still like it

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Thank you Elliot, great email

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Appreciate hearing from you, hope you're well

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Next email from Dark Tetsuya

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
We love hearing from Dark Tetsuya

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
And Dark Tetsuya is giving us a game review tonight

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Hey OLR, so a funny thing happened this week

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Destructoid was giving away copies of a new

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Download title for Nintendo Switch

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
It's also on Steam

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
As luck would have it, I was one of the winners

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
So I got to try this game out

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
So this game is from Flying Tiger and G-Mode

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Who you might remember them from the Data East

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Arcade line by Johnny Turbo

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Who as an aside was based on a real person

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
If you've ever read those weird comments they had

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
For the TurboGrafx-16 CD

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
That appeared in game magazines back in the day

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000
And came out on Switch and PC a couple weeks ago

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
The game itself is an interesting concept

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
They've taken some of the old graphics and sound

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Assets from the classic arcade games

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
And turned it into a team based

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Competition twin stick shooter

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Almost like Smash TV

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
You and a friend playing as BurgerTime star Peter

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Pepper compete in a two on two

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Game to take on the bag of money

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
And run it into your opponent's goal

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
But you'll have to traverse several screens

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Inspired by some of the Data East Arcade

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Classics like Heavy Barrel, Bad Dudes

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
And Karate Champ

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Each with its own themed stage hazards

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Like enemies and billiard balls

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Although I have to say the single player challenges

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Get insanely hard at times

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
This is definitely more of a party game

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
To get all your friends together and try to get to the goal

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Before the other team does

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
So I'd really only recommend this one if you have friends over

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Or take your system to parties or something

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
This is definitely more a multiplayer experience

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Especially considering it's 20 bucks

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
On Switch

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Well thank you for the game review

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
This was not a game on my radar

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
But you know I'm a sucker for retro games

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
And I love it when they take like retro stuff

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
And make new things out of it

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Like NES Remix right?

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
I don't know what they're doing here

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
It's kind of like a hodgepodge of the Data East games

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
So that's cool

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Yeah, fun

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Alright, one more email for us tonight

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
From Frodo Swagons

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Who says, Frodo Swagons here

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
I haven't owned a ton of gaming consoles

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
But when I think back at the ones

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
I have purchased or experienced

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
When I think of a specific console

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I always have a few favorite games

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
That come straight to mind

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Like my personal classics

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
I was wondering what are all of your favorite games

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
When you name off your consoles

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Minar for Nintendo 64

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Cruisin USA, GoldenEye, Pokemon Snap

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Ken Griffey Baseball, Mario 64

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
PlayStation

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Jet Moto, Kirby, Tomb Raider

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Space Jam, Crash Bandicoot

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
PC, Roller Coaster Tycoon

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Carmageddon, Doom

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Xbox, 007 Nightfire

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
NASCAR 99, Unreal Championship

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Test Drive, Fusion Frenzy

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Outlaw Golf

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
The games that you, not necessarily

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
The best games on the system

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Not necessarily the critical darlings

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
But what are the games that you

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Are always going to associate with a particular system?

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Loki, you want to dive into that

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Like Frodo Swagons said, thanks for the email

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
I don't know, that's a lot

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
But with PC games, I wouldn't even think about it like that

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
I think about it as the different PCs I've owned

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Because

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
It's going to be different

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
The PC is way too big

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
I'd say one of my first PCs

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
It would have to be Wolfenstein 3D

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
What the hell are they playing on there?

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I remember this original X-Men game

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
That I really liked on my old, old PC

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
The Sierra games

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
I think that was later though, because we had CD-Raw

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
No, I had

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
The Secret of Monkey Island

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
And then of course

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
What was something else?

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Click and Play

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
No, I didn't have Click and Play on that PC

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Oh

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Space Quest 4

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Was another one they had on there

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
And then of course

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
More modern

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
The PC after that

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
The next one we got was probably

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
ZZT

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Fuck yeah, ZZT

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Yeah, so ZZT, Click and Play

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Scorched Earth, Red Alert

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Would have been something I played

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
A lot of on there

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
I'll take on some of the consoles

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
So like for the NES

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
The Guardian Legend, I'm always going to associate

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
The Legend of Zelda, the original

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
For sure

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Mario Bros. 3, Mario Bros. 2

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
So I stayed up all night playing both those games

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
I remember renting Mario Bros. 2

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
On New Year's Eve

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Because the place would be closed on New Year's Day

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
So you got an extra day for free

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
So I remember getting in there and getting that Mario Bros. 2 copy that day

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
And I actually have a lot of memories playing

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Star Tropics as well

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
If I had played that game again today, I wouldn't remember my way through it

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Because I tried on the NES Classic

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
And Metroid

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Because with the Super Nintendo, obviously you know I'm going to say Super Metroid

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
But I'd also say

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Honestly, like some deeper cuts

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Equinox was always a favorite game of mine on that system

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Draken, just because that was the game I got

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
As a launch title

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
When my parents bought me the Super Nintendo

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
They bought that game because the guy at Montgomery Ward

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Recommended it to them

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
That is a true story

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
And then

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
I'd also say with Super Nintendo

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
I was on the tip of my tongue and I forgot

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Final Fantasy 3

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Which we all know is really 6

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
But it was 3 when it came out

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
PlayStation was during my college years

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
So I missed out on a lot of it

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
But for sure Final Fantasy 7

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Because I played the shit out of that when it was released

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Super Puzzle Fighter 2

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
I played a lot of that game

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
And other puzzlers too

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Like Intelligent Cube

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Played a bit of that

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Those are some games I would always associate with PlayStation

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
And yeah, I think

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
I think I've said enough

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Well, when it comes to the original PlayStation

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
I've got to, you know, talk about

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
DDR

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Yeah, oh for sure

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
We had the mod chip, well, mod cart

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
I guess

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Used to play all that stuff in there

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Gosh, I don't know

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
The Jungle Book Dancing Game

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Because that was the gateway drug into

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
The Jungle Book Dancing Game

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Because that was the gateway drug into

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
DDR, getting a dance mat in the US

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Remember? Who knows? I didn't say they were good

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
It's just games you associate

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Alright, thank you for the email FrodoSwagons

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
It's always fun to take a walk down memory lane

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Sia Tabiri says for the NES

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Mario 2, Mario 3, Dragon Spirit

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Little Nemo, Dream Master

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Dartitsia says for the PlayStation

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Parappa the Rappa, that's a good one

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Akuma JP says Einhander

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
on my PlayStation

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
So yeah, good answers you guys

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Alright, and to follow up on the previous

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
email, the question was asked

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
How many copies of Pokemon Let's

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Go did Shane get? So I texted

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
him, and he texted me back

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Here you go

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
So far, one copy of both

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Eevee and Pikachu, Pokeball

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Plus bundles, so two

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
And the Pikachu System

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
bundle, so three, so far

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Oh, and his boyfriend

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
technically is getting the Eevee

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Pokeball Plus bundle from me

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
So four. We just pre-ordered

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
four of the Pokeball chargers too

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
So there you go

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
He needs to offload some copies of the game

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
I'll take one of them because I haven't

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
purchased one yet, and I mean, just saying

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
You don't need multiple copies of the same game

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
It's, it's, I

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
You know what, like, y'all wanna give me shit

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
for buying Mass Effect 3 multiple, or my fourth

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
copy of Diablo 3 on Switch, but

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
I'm just saying, I'll take a copy of his

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Pikachu one, but, um

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
I'm just gonna go buy one, so I mean, might as well

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
It sounds like SSJ100Matt

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
won the bet in chat, I told you four

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Dardisius says, yeah, you called it

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
And AkumaJP says, damn, hardcore

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
But, I mean, this is not, like

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Shane loves Pokemon, he trades himself

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
That's what he does. Whatever, you like

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
something, I'm not gonna

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
You spend your money however the hell you want

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
I like DDR, I bought a goddamn machine

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
I have no room to talk

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Hey man, you have no room to talk, that's fine

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Alright, but there's the answer to the question

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Alright, let's move on, we have some

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to your calls

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
at OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
on Skype, but first some news, Loki

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
So you may remember there's some games that

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Japan's been getting that run on the

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Switch that may not necessarily run on the Switch

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
over here, because, well, they're streaming

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
games, and so

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Capcom was one of those that kind of

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
experimented with that, with Resident Evil 7

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
the Switch version, of course, you may remember

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Ubisoft did the same thing with

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
the new Assassin's Creed game

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
but apparently they've had some actual

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
success with the

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Switch version of Resident Evil 7

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
to the point where they're actually considering

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
on furthering

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
or to do some more of that

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
so, they're saying that, you know

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
after the success

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
of the

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Resident Evil 7

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
there was

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
they did the fact that there was a

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
significant impact

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
you know, with the interest in that

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
that they're gonna probably try some other games

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
and while we did release this

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
certain title, Supporting Cloud Gaming

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
in the first half, this was done primarily

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
for technology, or technological research

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
purposes, and did not have a

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
significant impact on earnings

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
based on the results of the

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
research, we internally considered

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
future expansion to cloud gaming, so

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
apparently

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
that might be something we'll see a little bit more

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
in Switch, and maybe even something that we'll see

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
leave just Japan, and

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
not, you know

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
venture into other regions as well

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
so, I'm curious

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
to see

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
where this kind of goes

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
they're gonna get a return on their investment

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
that's worthwhile

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
I don't know, they don't really have any huge

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
upcoming games, I think, that would really

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
benefit from something like this, because right now

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
the stuff that they've released over here

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
recently, it's been like fighting games

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
and stuff like that, that probably wouldn't be something you'd want to stream

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
bonds006

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
in chat sums this up, saying

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
in other words, they made money

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
so they will keep trying to make more money

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
best wishes, Capcom

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
AkumaJP says they are still testing the water

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
I mean, honestly guys

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
this is also relevant

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
because I could see a lot more

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
games going down this path

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
if you are able to successfully

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
play games on the cloud and have the minimal

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
you know

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
delay, I mean you

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
would never be able to play a music game in the cloud

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
at least not with today's technology, but who knows 10 years from now

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
but I really feel like when we get to

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
the Playstation 5 and the next box

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
we're gonna see a lot more of like

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
shit that happens in the cloud, like you were talking about

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
it's supposed to happen with Crackdown 3

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
but for whatever reason they dialed that back it sounds like

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
but I really do think

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
that's gonna be a major part of the next round of

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
consoles and how we're gonna get

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
even more mind-blowing graphics that take

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
forever to develop I'm sure

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
so, anyhow

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
moving on, if you

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
and then there's Nintendo Switch

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
talk about

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
the technological pushing the envelope

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
but then again, you know what

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
this is how the Nintendo Switch hangs in there

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
and this whole story was just about

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
putting some of these more technologically demanding games on the Switch

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
but the Switch finally got

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
something that people were wondering, when is this gonna happen

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
so if you were waiting for YouTube

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
on the Nintendo Switch, guess what

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
it finally frickin' happened this week

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
they used all that YouTube money that they siphoned

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
from people putting

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Nintendo games on YouTube

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
so anyway

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
YouTube is available around the world

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
it's on the UK store, North America store

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
I don't know about Japan, but I don't see why it wouldn't be

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
and of course

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
it's YouTube, and it's pretty much

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
the same interface and everything you're used to

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
on other platforms, but

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
now you can take it, essentially on the go

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
as long as there's internet

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
obviously it's still there, where you can't like download videos to watch later

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
that would be it

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
well, I mean, YouTube Red kinda lets you do that

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
right, but I don't think it does it on the Switch

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
I don't know, I haven't, I mean, who do I know that has

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
YouTube Red? All-Source has that. So many videos on my

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
32 gigabytes of internal storage

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
so

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
anyway, the YouTube app is

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
now out, by the way

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
and besides, you know, it's fine if you can't

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
necessarily download

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
videos to the Switch

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
because, what, you don't have a cell

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
phone or something?

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Don't y'all have phones? Don't y'all have phones?

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Anyway

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
that's what Nintendo's saying about voice chat

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
don't y'all have phones? But Nintendo

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
is also, on kind of a related note

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
looking to continue to add features to

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Switch online

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
a recent investor Q&A, Shontaro Furukawa

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
said

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
we think Nintendo Switch online had a good launch

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
but the service has only just begun

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
so we have no plans to disclose any current subscriber

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
ratios or number of subscribers at this time

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
that's kinda interesting

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
well, that sounds like it's not very high

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
then

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
I don't necessarily know if I would read into that

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
it may be

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
well, yes it would be, because if it was high

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
it may be lower than expectations

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
but I don't think that necessarily means

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
it's a flop

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
well, I don't think it's a flop, but like

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
I can tell you right now, I'm not like

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
woooo, Nintendo games

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
anyway, continuing in the

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
statement, Shontaro Furukawa said

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
as for the kind of service this will

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
develop into in the future, Nintendo Switch

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Online is essentially a digital service

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
but we are also offering controllers specifically

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
for use with Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Switch Online, exclusively to subscribers

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
of the service. We see the need to develop

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
the service beyond being merely

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
digital, in ways to play our

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
strengths as a company that operates

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
an integrated hardware and software

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
business, so I'm really surprised

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
that some of these new amiibo weren't

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
tied to this, but

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
so far they're not

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
it would be a hell of a way to get the ami-

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
do you know, so I found

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
out that

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Dark Souls came out on Nintendo Switch

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
right? Now, Alan

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
loves Dark Souls, like he plays

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
a lot, he just got the fucking

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
achievement for getting all the other achievements in Dark Souls

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
that is not something you do overnight, right?

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
So, he plays a lot of Dark Souls

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
and I was like, do you want me to buy Dark Souls

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
for you on Switch? And kind of knowing he

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
probably would never play it, he was like, nah

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
I don't really want it on Switch cause he's not

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
gonna play it compared to keyboard and mouse, he's like

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
but, I'd really like to get that Solari

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
amiibo. I was like, okay

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
alright, sure, cute little collectible

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
couldn't find it anywhere

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
come to find out that whole thing was a GameStop

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
exclusive, I forgot that Solari amiibo is a GameStop

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
exclusive, he goes into a GameStop

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
to try to find it while we were at the mall anyway

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
hunting Pokemon this weekend and they tell him

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
the guy, the clerk who works there

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
said he had never even seen one in person

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
because I guess they sold out instantly

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
when the pre-orders went up in March

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
and he actually told Alan

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
the best way to get those right now would be

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
on the reseller market

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
and I'm like, fuck resellers

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
period. Oh my god, does Nintendo not

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
understand supply chain?

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Oh yes, Nintendo doesn't understand supply

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
chain, quotey fingers, I mean

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
cause

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
I am so

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
sick of this, like

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
oh my god, we're just getting into

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
the physical, you know,

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
collectible market, we don't know what the fuck

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
we're doing, ahhh

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
I'm sorry, like, how

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
how often are we gonna use this

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
as an excuse, well we had no idea

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
what the demand would be

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
do you really have no analysts that fucking

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
do projections for you that you

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
didn't figure this shit out? I mean, I'm sorry

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
that's just really, terrible

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
excuse, like, this many years into it

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
where it's like this all the fucking

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
time

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Anyway, if anyone out there has a lead

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
on how I could get one of these, not through

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
a reseller market cause I'm not paying markup

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
I would super deeply appreciate it

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
but I'm not gonna expect anything, but you can always hit me up

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
on Twitter at MrRobRoberts, but it would make my hubby

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
very happy if we could locate one

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
cause now it's a thing

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Alright, let's move on, a few more stories

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
before we get to the Skypline, Loki

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Alright, so

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
apparently there is this leak that's

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
come out where Valve is developing

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
a new VR

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
headset

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
so they've got images of like this prototype

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Valve headset and there's a Valve

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
like, watermark on this

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
looks like circuit board here

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
they're saying that

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
apparently from the sources

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
that we're talking about, it's like

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
gonna have a 135 degree

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
view with a Vive Pro

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
resolution and

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
it's gonna be combined with, or possibly

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
combined with these Knuckles controllers

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
that they have and they're saying as well as

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
a Half-Life based VR game

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
that's gonna be a prequel

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
rather than a sequel

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
possibly

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
but there are like apparently

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
screenshots

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
here of this and they're saying that something looks like

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
they have a spot almost where a leap sensor

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
could fit

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
interesting though

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
no word on any sort of

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
details on when something like this would be released

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
but it is something that they're working on

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
so I guess I'll have to wait and see

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
you don't have

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
HTC Vive right? I don't, no

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
would you consider picking this up or HTC Vive

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
or any of that? If it was affordable

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
and

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
really that's it, if it's affordable cause

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
like right now that's what's stopping me from

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
purchasing yet another VR headset

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
I just don't play enough VR stuff

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
I do want one for PC because there's a lot

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
more out there on the PC

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
side but

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
I don't know

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
I'm still fine with just the

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
PlayStation VR for now

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
alright well

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
in other news related

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
to our little quip about don't you all have

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
phones which I feel like that line's gonna get said

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
once a week on this show for a very long time

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
but some interesting follow up

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
rumors, heavy heavy rumors about

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
what was to be at Blizzcon

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
of course that story showed up that said

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
that Diablo 4 was

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
a planned announcement and it was

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
yanked at the last minute

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
that was a rumor that Kotaku posted

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
but then they ended up updating it

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
to basically say the article

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
that originally stated that Blizzard recorded

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
a video and that co-founder

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Alan Adam was going to talk about a new Diablo

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
game. Kotaku

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
is still sticking by that that video

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
was made but Blizzard is officially

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
disputing that it was ever planned for

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Blizzcon in a statement

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
to Kotaku Blizzard said first off

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
we want to mention that we definitely hear our community

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
we generally don't comment on rumors or

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
speculation but we can say that we didn't pull

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
any announcements from Blizzcon this year or

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
have plans for other announcements we do

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
continue to have different teams working on

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
multiple unannounced Diablo projects

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
and we look forward to announcing when the time

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
is right but Kotaku is doubling

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
down basically saying two people

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
familiar with Blizzard's plans confirmed

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
that the company recorded a video

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
where co-founder Alan Adam said

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
spoke to fans about a new Diablo

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
project so basically

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
what's being disputed is what

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
is it for?

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Perhaps it's an

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
announcement for the game awards which

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
would seem ridiculous to me to not

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
play that at Blizzcon

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
like if it turns out

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
that they're going to announce it at the game awards

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
and they passed Blizzcon to do that

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
that's whoo oh

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
the Blizzard fans are not

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
going to be happy. Well on top of that too

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
I did see something

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
that was a press event or something

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
like shortly after all the announcements

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
and they were talking about

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
that their development teams

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
that are working on Diablo

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
that a lot of them

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
or even some of their top developers

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
from all the different

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
franchises that they have are working on

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
mobile projects so that

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
pissed people off as well because they're like

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
well wait a second you're taking your top people

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
from all these other things to

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
develop mobile games

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
what the fuck you guys

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
so that's just

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
kind of a little bit more salt

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
in the wounds I guess

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Well

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
what do you think? Do you think

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
it's possible that they were going

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
to announce it and then they pulled it?

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I'm like why would you pull that?

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
I guess there's concern about

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
oh it's the game's been

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
going in these different directions and

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
it's kind of you know it's hitting that

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
phase a lot of games do where they're not totally

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
sure like what the final product is going to look like but I'm like

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
you could still just announce

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
you're doing it like it's everything I said in

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
last week's show if they had just followed up

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
that announcement just like

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Bethesda did with a 30 second trailer

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
that shows the Diablo 4 logo

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
it doesn't even have to be the final logo

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
just one that they could then

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
sell on t-shirts and people would buy it. It's too late

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
though. It's too late now

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
but I mean I just

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
I feel like video game PR people

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
are going to study this fuck up for years

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
They'll remember it

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
for sure

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Anyway moving on

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
a couple more stories before the

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Skype line just two more Loki

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Alright and so apparently

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
there's

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
with you guys may remember

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Smash Brothers so with

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Mr. Game and Watch

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
they had some different attacks that were

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
in there one of which unfortunately

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
is mildly racist apparently

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
so it's the attack where

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
he kind of

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
looks like a Native American

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
or whatever and he

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
throws fire so apparently

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
this fire attack which is

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
from well the game fire attack

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
might be a little bit offensive

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
nowadays so they're going to be

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
retooling that and changing

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
it because it doesn't necessarily

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
represent the company's values

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
nowadays

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
so they're going to have to I guess

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
redesign how that's going to look

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
and it will be in effect

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
I guess in the new Smash

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Brothers game so they say

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
yeah Nintendo's been planning to distribute an

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
update for Smash Brothers Ultimate

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
that removes the feature or the

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
feather from the silhouette of Mr. Game

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
and Watch

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
the original game on

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
which is this depiction of the character's base

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
was released more than three decades ago and doesn't

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
represent our company's values today

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
we apologize if you were offended

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
alright

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
well I suppose that's nice

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
of a company to listen to the feedback and

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
correct their course yeah

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
that's just a minor thing alright

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
before we go to the phones

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
I do want to point out another heavy

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
rumor but I think this is more

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
than rumor because it was discovered in a Steam

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
database that

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Sunset Overdrive is on its way

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
to the PC this

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
after an ESRB listing was already

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
released now I bet this is the type of thing

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
that could show up at Game Awards because if

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
they didn't announce it at X018

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
which would have been the perfect place to do it

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
well I guess not, not for PC

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
I would think that Game Awards is like a shoe-in

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
they're going to come out in Game Awards and say this is Sunset

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Overdrive is available today

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
on PC I would bet that's going to be

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
what happens we'll see but anyway

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
a lot of people that did play this game really

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
enjoy it, it kind of went under the radar

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
for a lot of people I think just because the Xbox One

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
didn't end up as highly adopted

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
I'm surprised it's becoming the Steam and not like

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
the Windows Store I guess

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Microsoft probably just wants to put it everywhere

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
but then again wasn't

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
their other game that was

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
I can't remember what the hell that game was called

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
but like the other

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Xbox One game that

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
was a Kinect game but not a Kinect game

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
anymore I can't remember

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
what the fuck it was called but

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Kinect developed it but

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
I don't know I think that

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
well but then Forza is not available on Steam

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
well then the other one too also

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Dead Rising, didn't Dead Rising

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
end up coming out? I believe it did you're right

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
yeah so

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
but yeah so anyway looks like Sunset Overdrive

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
is going to be happening it's just a matter

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
of when and honestly

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Microsoft is releasing most things on

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
PC and Xbox anyway

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Crackdown 3 has got to be a PC game as well right?

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
yeah it's going to be on the Windows Store

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
honestly I might just pick it up on PC well I guess

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
I might as well get the one that's universal right? You buy it

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
digitally you get the universal thing right? I imagine that's still

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
going to be the case just like it was for Forza

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
yeah I think so I'll probably pick that up that's pretty cool

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
so cool Sunset Overdrive

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
probably on its way to PC

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
I wonder how that's going to work though if I already own it on

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Xbox One thanks to games with gold

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
I would already own it digitally so are they going to

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
give me the PC one for free? They might if they

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
make it a play anywhere type thing

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
that would actually be I would be like so happy

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
I mean I guess Steam wouldn't really be involved

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
in that case but still hey free game

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
so alright

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
let's go to the phones you can

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
too it is great to hear from

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
you I'm here every week you're here

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
almost every week well

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
I try I try so

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
you know coming out of the end of the con

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
season and so forth you know well we appreciate

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
it so what's on your mind tonight buddy

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Sunset Orange Drive is

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
is one again that's one of those games

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
how did I miss it

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
I picked it up for 10 bucks and

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
I'm having a fucking blast with

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
that game I think there's a lot of people that really

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
slept on the game and to be honest I haven't played

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
it a lot and it's one of those titles I really need

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
to go back and play more but especially

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
if it does end up being play anywhere on

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
PC I think I probably yeah

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
I'd like super check it out why not

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
I mean they gave that game away

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
so I think a lot of people have it

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
yeah definitely and

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
another thing I

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
quit like the tail end of

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
XO 18 like the summary

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
and I have to say

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Microsoft kind of got me shook

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
why is that what what what

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
shook you at XO 18

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
the studio purchases or what

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
no Final Fantasy backwards

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
compatibility

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
that I mean I'm excited for

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
people that owned it on Xbox but I

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
had them on PlayStation so unfortunately

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
it does me no good and I just

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
I don't see myself buying those

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
games on Xbox one when

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
I already did buy Final Fantasy 13

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
on PC and

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
you might remember it was a little bit bumpy when it first

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
came out on PC it had like some

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
graphic things holding it back but they they tweaked

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
it and they release you know they they like updated

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
it via patch and it's it's pretty

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
solid like the PC release is pretty good

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
so I feel like if

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
they up rezzed or

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
did anything special to Final Fantasy

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
they probably just kind of ported the PC version

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
to Xbox one which is not a bad

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
thing it's it's great it looked great on

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
PC I don't know I think they went

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
back and worked on the 360 version

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
and made it a little bit better I mean

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
yes I have all three

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
games for PlayStation 3 but

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
I think about

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
almost a year ago I had my

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
system reflowed

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
and now when I turn on my PS3

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
it sounds like a jet engine

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
and I'm looking at the prices of

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
FF 13 on

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
360 and it's like I could pick up all

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
three games for 25 bucks

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
which is like probably cheaper

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
than what it's going to be you know

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
in the in the Microsoft store you know

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
for Xbox one that's

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
that's not bad yeah I

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
I do think there was a missed opportunity here to

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
like repackage and release a trilogy

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
but that's

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
you see you got that on the second hand market

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
for 25 bucks yeah on

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Amazon that's

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
really not a bad idea that may that

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
may be a way to do it like to pick up the games

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
on the second hand market and then play them that way

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
is actually like a really smart idea kudos

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
on that that's what I've been doing a lot

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
of the games and I notice you know

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
yes GameStop may have

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
it for 19 bucks used

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
but I can just go right over to Amazon

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
pick it up for the same price brand spanking new

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
in the case everything so

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
yeah and now that you got

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
the other Final Fantasy games coming

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
over I'm just kind of hyped about

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
it and you know I get

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
it that the Final Fantasy

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
games are supposed to be like defunct

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
to Playstation I get that

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
right but it's like I said

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
the only reason why I

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
picked up a 360

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
I mean Xbox one is for the

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
backwards compatibility and

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
half of my 360 games play

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
on the one hell when I thought

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
about Crackdown I popped that in last night

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
and I'm up for like two hours playing through that

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
game I'm just like this looks

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
amazing well and now

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
even if you didn't have Crackdown we just

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
mentioned earlier they're giving it away

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
so you can get Crackdown so

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
there's no reason not to check

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
it out which of course is all just promo

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
for Crackdown

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
3 which is very similar

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
to and again a reminder this is kind

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
of your last chance cause it's only gonna be up for

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
another week but Destiny 2

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
is free on PC

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
if you have the battle net launcher which if

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
you've ever played Hearthstone or

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
some of the free games that

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Blizzard has then you have the

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
battle net launcher you can get free Destiny 2

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
but we all know it's because

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
they have an expansion they're trying to sell so

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
that's the thing you're gonna have to buy

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
but hey it's still a free game

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
I mean yeah I dumped on that too so

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
yeah

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
so well free stuff is good

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
and backwards compatibility

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
is great and I really

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
wish it was a message that Sony would hear

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
but for whatever reason they're not

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
I mean

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
look we had backwards compatibility

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
for the Playstation 2 to the 1

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
we had a PS3 for 1

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
and 2 until they ripped

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
that out and put it in the slip

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
now they can't

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
say it cannot be done

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
because the

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Xbox One and

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
the Playstation 4 are the

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
same identical

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
hardware

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
the speeds of the processors are slightly different

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
the software that runs it is different

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
but it can't be done

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
I mean if Microsoft can do it

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
it's no excuse

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Sony can't, Microsoft's like oh we got this

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
it's backwards compatible we have it in the store

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
for $19.99 wait you have

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
the game pop it in yours now

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
for free we already know if

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
nothing else that machine is perfectly capable

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
of doing PS1 and PS2 games

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
if nothing else we know

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
the Playstation 4 can do that so

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
it's just weird to me that they don't

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
open it up so and I see in chat

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Kaijuto says I don't ever want Sony

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
to go back well I'm not like

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
I honestly feel at this

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
point it's like a switch it's a button

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
that Sony won't push

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
you know and if you don't want to play retro

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
stuff fine don't again it's your money

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
spend it on what you want but for those of us

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
that would love to play Magic Penjel again

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
on Playstation 4

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
let us do it

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
I mean I understand there are

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
some people out there that are console

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
collectors they have the space for it

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
if you saw my entertainment center

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
I'm running out of space

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
I'm picking up the PS4 on Black Friday

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
and I'm looking

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
well there I'm going to take the PS2 out

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
and put the PS4 there

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
like you said I'd be happy with the PS1

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
emulation on the PS4

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
I can retire my PS3 fat

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
that sounds like a NASA jet rocket

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
and put a slim in there and call

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
it a day

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
well we'll see if

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
this gamble pays off for Sony

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
by the time the Playstation 5 rolls around

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
because I bet you I just

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
it's so interesting because

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
I just remember when it was

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Playstation 3 versus Xbox 360

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
and Microsoft clobbered

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Sony out the gate anyway

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
and Sony spent a long time catching up

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
and the tables got reversed

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
this last time and Sony clobbered

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Microsoft out the gate

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
you know Microsoft is catching up to an extent

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
but Sony's got the lead

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
I'm almost wondering if

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
it's going to flip again

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
and coming out with the next series

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
because Microsoft's got all these studios

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
and will likely open itself up

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
to backwards compatibility and pretty much has already

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
said that no matter what they do

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
with the Xbox in the future it's still going to play

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
the older games or whatever

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
so it would be interesting to see if Sony's going to

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
follow suit or if they're going to stay stubborn like this

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
and if that decision comes back

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
to bite them

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
you know you said it back

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
a few episodes back

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
as long as Sony's on top

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
they're not going to care

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
when Microsoft was on top they're not going to care

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
and then the role was reversed

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
so why hasn't either company learned yet

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
that maybe you should care when you're on top

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
because you're not going to be on top forever

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
well I think Microsoft is starting to learn

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
like when they had their

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Windows phones

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
their Windows phones are great

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
on a business level

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
but not on a personal

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
the hardware is there

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
the apps are not

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
the fact that Square Enix

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
says the Final Fantasy games are coming to Xbox One

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
that means

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Microsoft is starting to realize

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
you need to not just

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
throw money to buy studios

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
you need to throw money at the third party to be like

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
here's X amount of money

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
we want these titles on our system

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
I mean that's basically what Sony is doing

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
I mean look at the gaming

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
tournaments for fighting games

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
mostly everyone's playing on PS4

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
for the fighting games

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
next year is going to be a hell of a year

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
because I anticipate

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Microsoft is going to be first out the gate

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
next year so it's going to be very

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
interesting to see what happens

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
alright my friend I'm going to let you go

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
to try and squeeze in some more calls but thank you as always

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
for the call

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
take care buddy

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
OrangeLawnTradio all went over it on Skype

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
and I had cut off a last minute story you wanted

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
to do Loki while we wait for calls

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
there's this game called Scum which apparently

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
had a patch issued

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
for it that fixed

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
a bunch of bugs in the games

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
all related to penis size

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
because I like this game like Conan

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
or Age of Conan I believe

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
you create your character and the penis

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
size and there's an issue where

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
the penis size would get bigger

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
each time you logged in

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
and there's also one that says

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
it's possible to increase penis size without it

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
affecting other attributes and

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
urinating would lock hands if the penis

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
and penis if

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
interrupted

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
penises are very complicated

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
things apparently

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
in video games

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
alrighty

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
then

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
DarkTit Studio in chat says

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
this isn't a SoulCalibur 6 situation is it

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
also wow speaking of SoulCalibur 6

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
oh no I think we did touch on it last week

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
the Nier character coming to SoulCalibur 6 I guess that wasn't

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
rapid fire last week I think

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
I think we mentioned it yeah

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
I need to still pick up SoulCalibur 6

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
I still have not picked that up

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
and I really want to play it but

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
it's that time of year where everything's coming out

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
now we got Let's Go and

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
all this other stuff

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
one more call for calls Orange Lounge Radio all one word

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
on Skype

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
and by the way I just want you guys to know

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
that I'm extremely

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
happy because it sounds like somebody's coming through

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
on the Amiibo that I need

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
so I'm like super jazzed about that

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
you don't even know so

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
you guys are awesome this is what motivates me to keep

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
coming back every week to do this show

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
for serious how awesome you guys are

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
um

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
did you do

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
no other stories no

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
I did see someone talking about

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
since you know obviously we have

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
a very good version of Tetris

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
on the Playstation 4

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
that there was a not so

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
good version of Tetris Ubisoft

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
made about a year ago

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
on the Playstation 4 I think

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
I think I actually own that one too

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
I think you do own it

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
I don't remember what the

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
I feel like it had frame rate issues or something

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
like really basic that shouldn't have been there so

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
uh it's always interesting to see

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
like who gets the Tetris license and what they do with it

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
because I feel like the Tetris company really

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
licenses that out to like multiple people

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
at once like pretty much whoever wants

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
to do it so but I'm

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
they might as well just delist

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
the whatever Ubisoft made last year well

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
I shouldn't be such an ass

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
because it had the

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
multiplayer stuff a little more embedded in it

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
and Tetris Effect doesn't have multiplayer

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
but you know it does have multiplayer

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Puyo Puyo vs Tetris has a decent

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
multiplayer in it and it has Puyo Puyo

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
so you know

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
I still think they'll inevitably

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
do a Tetris Effect 2 I mean I really

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
hope they do I

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
just as long as

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Tetsuya Mizuguchi gets to keep making games

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
I think they just do DLC

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
maybe

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
I mean I would love to see them just do more skins

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
and songs maybe some commercial

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
stuff as DLC

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
yeah well remember

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
when Luminous on 360 I know I brought this up before

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
remember when we went to that E3 and they were

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
showing Luminous on 360 with like

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
MTV type songs as skins

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
and I've I this never

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
came out but I played Madonna's

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Sorry that song in that music

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
video was a Luminous skin that they never

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
released for whatever reason I don't know if the licensing

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
fell through or what but that was something I played

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
at E3 and I was super excited about it I remember

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
not being able to really hear it on the show floor

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
but it had the video of Madonna dancing

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
and the only stuff

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
we ever really got was all like the in-house

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
like Genki Rockets and all that stuff

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
they never did like

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
actual songs

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
probably thought they couldn't get the return on investment

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
maybe I don't know but Luminous 2

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
on PSP which people

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
don't talk about as much as the original

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Luminous 2 had a lot of commercial

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
stuff in it it had like Hollaback Girl

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
it had a Missy Elliott song it had Beck

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
it had like a lot of commercial stuff in it

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
I still don't remember that now

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
I don't know why people didn't like that version

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
of the game as much I thought it was great

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
but anyway

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
alright well sadly that's

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
looks like the well is pretty dry on phone

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
calls but that's okay you guys did great on

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
emails tonight if you do think of anything

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
you would like to email us about

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
you can send us an email participate at

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
orangeloungeradio.com if you don't send us

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
emails I mean look out because they just announced

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars 4

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
so I'll have plenty to talk about

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
alright

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
anyway that's about going to do it

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
for another episode of Orange Laundrio

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
I want to thank you guys for listening to our show

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
and being here every week to support us really appreciate

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
it and if you like what you heard here at Orange Laundrio

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
please tell a friend or two about the show

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
and help us spread the word because we are the show where every

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
gamer has a voice but only if the

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
voices are here to air them

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
so please a nice 5 star

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
review on a place like iTunes or

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Google Play podcast or wherever it is you

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
heard about this those go

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
a long way as well I am aware

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
that you can get more podcasts on Spotify

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
that is a direction I will go with

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
OLR soon but behind the scenes

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
we're going to be moving our hosting around

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
the same time that we move to Twitch

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
so for that reason I've held off on Spotify

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
submission but I know that's something on people's radar

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
and I will get us there

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
soon so but

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
otherwise we're in a lot of podcasting places

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
as it is

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
I think that's all I have to say

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
so I think we can go around and get final thoughts

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Loki your final thought tonight

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
my final thought is I have

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
a hell of a migraine and I'm not sure if it's

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
because I spent the whole day with the kids or because

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
of the smoke or a little bit of both

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
a little bit of column A a little bit of column B

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
for sure for sure and I guess on

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
that note my final thought is

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
I just I

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
hope people are okay after the

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
fires I hope they're able to build stuff back

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
it's just it's so horrible

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
reading about all that and knowing that I've been to a

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
town that doesn't exist anymore it's really weird

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
but my thoughts are with everybody

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
affected by that and for those near

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
the smoke stay indoors play

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
some video games that's probably the

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
best thing to do right now have a great night

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
