14000	18000	Hello from the other side, it's 2018. New year, new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
18000	26000	We're starting off by reviewing the past and predicting the future. This, the year's gaming new so far and so much more starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	48000	Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 713 for this January 7th, 2018, our first show of the new year since we had just done a show on New Year's Day.
49000	55000	Excuse me, New Year's Eve. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E.
55000	61000	We are live at the Voice Geeks Network as we are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
61000	67000	If you are listening to us live, thank you for choosing us over the Golden Globes for one because I don't, I don't understand.
67000	71000	Like the Golden Globes is what? Like the Hollywood Foreign Press is like 80 people. Who cares? Anyway, whatever.
71000	73000	And awesome games done quick.
73000	76000	Oh, hey, you're back. Welcome. DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?
76000	77000	Wise from your grave.
77000	82000	Yes. Now, okay, if you're skipping us for awesome games done quick, that one I get.
82000	85000	But you can have it running quiet on the side while you listen to us.
85000	89000	We don't have a video stream. Oh, that's the new excuse I'm going to use for why we don't do video.
89000	96000	So you can watch other charity video streams. Well, who not? 2018, don't rule anything out. That's all I'm going to say.
96000	99000	So anyway, hi DarkSakura. I hope you're doing well.
99000	100000	I'm doing better.
100000	103000	I know you weren't able to join us on New Year's Eve, but I hope everything's all right.
103000	109000	Well, I'm not taking any coding right now, so I'm lucid.
109000	112000	And I'm not going to, a few people know what happened.
112000	116000	I'm just going to give a little bit of information because it's nobody's business.
116000	123000	But I did have surgery. I'm in recovery for a month. I'm recovering fine. I just get really tired.
123000	127000	Well, if you need to take a nap, you can go crawl in with Mr. Swoosh.
127000	131000	I'm currently reclined in this chair, so that might, you know.
131000	133000	Hey, Jamie, what's next in the news tonight?
133000	134000	Yeah.
134000	139000	All right. Well, always here. Well, almost always here. I mean, he takes a week off now and then two, but he's here tonight.
139000	140000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
140000	141000	Hello, I'm here.
141000	142000	Hey, Loki, how you doing?
142000	143000	I'm fine.
143000	147000	Good. So we were having a little conversation as we usually do before the show.
147000	153000	We are a show about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, but gaming culture, it tends to bleed into other things too, right?
153000	158000	So one of the random topics we were talking about before going live tonight while Bobby was wrapping up his show,
158000	161000	we were talking about movies that scared the hell out of us as a kid.
161000	165000	Now, keep in mind, we're all late thirties, early forties here.
165000	172000	So, you know, we might come from a different generation than some of you listening, but I'm sure some of you know these movies.
172000	175000	So, so quickly, Loki, what was a movie that scared the hell out of you as a kid?
175000	183000	Um, I would say probably, I know some like, I think it was American.
184000	188000	American Tail? Was it the first one maybe? Like, I'm getting...
188000	191000	Oh yeah, I remember the American Tail. Fievel, was that the little mouse's name?
191000	193000	Yeah, I think it was the first American Tail.
193000	194000	It was Don Bluth.
194000	196000	Yeah, they made a ton of those movies.
196000	201000	Which, relating to games Don Bluth did, Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, he was a very prolific animator.
201000	202000	That wasn't that bad.
202000	203000	And Xanadu.
203000	210000	The one movie that I saw, I mean, that didn't really kind of creep me out, but like one that kind of stuck with me was The Gate, which was kind of...
210000	211000	That movie was great.
211000	212000	I don't know that one.
212000	213000	It was terrible.
213000	216000	It's the one where the kids open a portal to hell in their backyard using a heavy metal album.
216000	217000	What?
217000	221000	And one of the kids gets like an eyeball in his hand and has to stab it out and everything.
221000	222000	Yeah, that's the scene that I remember.
222000	225000	I don't, I have no, oh my god, was it rated R? I wasn't allowed to watch it.
225000	228000	And they had like the portal inside their house and had like the balcony around.
228000	232000	Yeah, they have like little like gremlin troll things that are popping out.
232000	234000	See, I wasn't allowed to watch R.E. movies growing up.
234000	237000	I did that at a friend's house, of course, and then when their parents were home.
237000	240000	My mom wouldn't let me watch gremlins. She thought it was too scary.
240000	241000	I saw gremlins in the theater.
241000	244000	Oh my god. I hear that movie fucked up a lot of people.
244000	247000	Eleven. I think I was eleven. Ten or eleven. Yeah.
247000	252000	Gremlins was great. You know, the thing is, is that like not movies weren't very scary to me.
252000	256000	There were only two movies that actually gave me nightmares after.
256000	260000	And one of them was The Thing.
260000	263000	But that movie, I can't even watch it as an adult.
263000	265000	The John Carpenter.
265000	266000	Oh yeah.
266000	270000	Yeah. And the other one is, believe it or not, it doesn't do it anymore.
270000	272000	But when I was a kid, Poltergeist 3.
272000	275000	OK, they were just saying in chat, Tiger Claw said, what about Poltergeist?
275000	277000	Oh, that's a good one.
277000	280000	The first Poltergeist was my favorite movie when it came out.
280000	281000	Oh my gosh.
281000	282000	My sister.
282000	283000	I wasn't allowed to watch it.
283000	288000	My sister and I used to use the car as the TV and she would be Carol Ann because she was blonde.
288000	290000	That's awesome.
290000	294000	But no, I love I fucking love the first one. The second one was shit.
294000	297000	But the third one, because I had a mirror phobia.
297000	300000	Did they have a Poltergeist game on Atari 2600?
300000	301000	I don't remember.
301000	302000	It would have been terrible.
302000	303000	It probably was.
303000	306000	Well, some of the movie games like Indiana Jones was really good.
306000	311000	But anyway, I went through a period of time where I actually had a minor mirror phobia.
311000	312000	Wow.
312000	313000	Yeah, it wasn't very big.
313000	319000	But after I saw the movie, because, you know, the thing was going through the mirror and everything, I was obsessed with all the special effects.
319000	320000	And I loved it.
320000	323000	I loved it. Even knowing how they did everything.
323000	330000	It was I couldn't look in a mirror for about a week.
330000	334000	Other than that, there's only three scenes and something that's fucked me up.
334000	337000	And they all have to do with faces melting or faces doing weird things.
337000	339000	Oh, like in Indiana Jones.
339000	342000	In Gremlins and Indiana Jones, you know, where Stripe melted.
342000	343000	Yeah.
343000	344000	Spoiler, Stripe melts.
344000	345000	Well, come on, that movie's how old?
345000	346000	Kidding.
346000	351000	The face melting in Indiana Jones and Large Marge in Pee Wee.
351000	352000	Oh, God.
352000	354000	Large Marge. You didn't even say that one before the show.
354000	355000	That movie.
355000	356000	Oh, my God.
356000	358000	I love that scene.
358000	361000	You know, that actress just passed away.
361000	362000	Yeah.
362000	363000	Not even a couple weeks ago.
363000	364000	No, she did not melt.
364000	366000	She was also because I.
366000	367000	OK, look.
367000	369000	Till Large Marge sent you.
369000	373000	You all know that I am married to a guy, so therefore I'm homosexual.
373000	374000	One of those.
374000	377000	You know, I don't like to buy into all the gay stereotypes sometimes,
377000	380000	but, you know, I love me some Mommy Dearest.
380000	383000	And so Large Marge was also Helga in Mommy Dearest.
383000	386000	I'm not mad at you Helga.
386000	388000	I'm mad at the dirt.
388000	389000	For anyone who saw that movie.
389000	390000	All right.
390000	392000	You know, I'm going to quote Mommy Dearest.
392000	394000	Although you say Helga, now I think of Clay Fighter.
394000	397000	What about Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
397000	398000	Oh, yeah.
398000	399000	Oh, that movie.
399000	401000	Yeah, the scene in that one did it.
401000	402000	It's really just.
402000	403000	That game too.
403000	404000	Shit.
404000	408000	But I it's just the scenes will still kind of get me for the same reasons,
408000	411000	because I know that they're fake and terrible, but they'll still do it.
411000	414000	Other than that, though, I mean, like.
414000	419000	I've seen a lot of movies in the theater that I was technically too young to see.
419000	421000	You know, so I don't care.
421000	422000	OK, so here's mine.
422000	425000	So my uncle took me to see Kroll and that was awesome.
425000	427000	My mom did try to protect me from a lot of the scary stuff,
427000	431000	but we went to the movie theater and nobody in chat has said this yet.
431000	432000	I can't believe this.
432000	433000	This is for me.
433000	437000	This is the king of all like movies that will fuck you up as a kid.
437000	442000	I saw in the theater taken by my mother to see Return to Oz.
442000	443000	Fucking love it.
443000	444000	I love the first one.
444000	445000	Exactly right.
445000	447000	Because you think, oh, right.
447000	449000	It's the it's the sequel to The Wizard of Oz.
449000	451000	Although in reality, it's more complicated than that.
451000	453000	Those books became public domain at some point or something.
453000	454000	Disney got the rights.
454000	455000	I don't know what happened.
455000	458000	So they they made because if you didn't know The Wizard of Oz,
459000	462000	like bomb wrote like what, like twenty three books.
462000	465000	And then there were, I think, some
465000	469000	pseudonym used his name as a non de plume.
469000	473000	So so anyway, they took to two of the books and they kind of combined it.
473000	475000	And they made Return to Oz, which if you didn't know,
475000	478000	Dorothy was Fruza Balk, who later was in the craft.
478000	482000	Right. So the whole thing starts with like her at a mental institution,
482000	486000	trying to escape, getting like electro shock therapy and like all these people
486000	487000	turning into stones.
487000	490000	And then the wicked queen has all the heads in the jars.
490000	492000	Like that fucked me up.
492000	495000	That movie, I think.
495000	498000	My God, that was by far like the scariest movie, I think.
498000	500000	And that movie is only rated like PG.
500000	503000	I don't think the movie that my son,
503000	507000	my youngest son loves Coraline.
507000	508000	I love Coraline.
508000	509000	I haven't seen it.
509000	511000	That's a pretty twisted movie, too.
511000	512000	Is it?
512000	515000	It's actually super faithful to the book, too.
515000	518000	And I really I love both the book and the movie.
518000	521000	It's like this demon that tries to lure children into this,
521000	525000	like other dimension to basically steal their soul.
525000	529000	When I when I was a kid, it is an animated movie,
529000	530000	but it was animated for adults.
530000	533000	It was a movie called Rock and Rule.
533000	534000	Rock and Rule Racing.
534000	535000	I love that game.
535000	536000	Rock and Rule.
536000	537000	Rock and Rule.
537000	541000	And it was like this future post-apocalyptic where basically rodents
541000	544000	became the dominant species, the humanoid rodents.
544000	548000	And I'm trying to remember the soundtrack to it never got a full release,
548000	551000	but it was Iggy Pop, Deborah Harry.
551000	556000	The one who was the speaking voice of the main girl in that movie was also
556000	559000	Sailor Jupiter in the U.S. Sailor Moon.
559000	567000	But the movie was really kind of like on that odd edge of kind of glam had
567000	571000	like the bad guy was like a glam rock guy who is certainly supposed to emulate
571000	572000	David Bowie.
572000	573000	Just evil.
573000	578000	But the movie, you know, was so it was beyond what I was supposed to have
578000	580000	been watching, but I fucking love that movie.
580000	586000	Never had a U.S. release on any home media except for one limited VHS
586000	588000	and a Canadian laserdisc.
588000	592000	And then they released it on DVD when I was an adult.
592000	593000	And guess who fucking bought it?
593000	594000	Of course you did.
594000	596000	I also bought a bootleg that was taped off of HBO.
596000	600000	You know, not to shift the topic back to gaming a little bit.
600000	601000	No, that's OK.
601000	604000	You talk about David Bowie inspiration, like David Bowie inspired so much
604000	606000	and even still today.
606000	610000	Like you look at Moira in Overwatch is the thing that comes to mind for me.
610000	612000	They just introduced her a couple of months ago.
612000	614000	She's very David Bowie.
614000	617000	I think one of her skins is like straight up Aladdin same.
617000	619000	Like it's just it's pretty cool.
619000	624000	Like you see Bowie's influence in movies and gaming and beyond.
624000	627000	Well, Bowie was always very technically savvy to you.
627000	629000	He had that computer game in ninety nine.
629000	631000	You did it for Classic Game of the Week once.
631000	634000	He was very technically savvy with all that stuff.
634000	636000	But anyway, I'm digressing a bit.
636000	638000	I do have to give one more statement about that.
638000	640000	The other people who did music in that.
640000	646000	It was Cheap Trick, Chris Stein, Deborah Harry, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and Earth Wind and Fire.
646000	651000	It's just like it's like a who's who of like awesome stars from that day.
651000	653000	But oh my God, it was so good.
653000	655000	All right. Anyway, we do want to get into games.
655000	658000	And in fact, being that it is the first show of the year,
658000	661000	we thought and Dark Soccer is back with us tonight.
661000	664000	We thought, what better time to revisit the time capsule?
664000	667000	Do you remember this from a few months ago?
667000	669000	Yeah. And some of you thought, boy, you guys are really dumb.
669000	673000	Putting together a time capsule in the summer that you're going to open in six months.
673000	675000	Like what's the suspense in that?
675000	678000	Y'all gaming changes so fast.
678000	681000	I mean, I don't know about you guys, but I've already talked about this before.
681000	684000	How like I'll go from one game to another so fast.
684000	688000	Right. Like, you know, I might be playing Overwatch or something and then squirrel.
688000	692000	You know, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 comes out and I go play that for a little bit.
692000	693000	And then the next week, something else comes out.
693000	697000	You know, there's that. And, you know, just the way technology moves and changes.
697000	702000	Right. Like think about how far we've come in the year at this point last year.
702000	708000	I think we had just had that Switch press conference that told us here is the Switch and this is what it is.
708000	711000	And this is the launch date and all that. And before that, we knew very little.
711000	713000	That was just one year ago.
713000	716000	And how many rooftop parties has the Switch cost?
716000	717000	Zero.
717000	718000	Well, we don't know.
718000	719000	Totally let down.
719000	724000	4K gaming, you know, was not something we had really a year ago.
724000	726000	It's still not really something we have now.
726000	730000	Maybe for the highest NPCs. But come on, we do have Forza, you know, is that.
730000	733000	We've got more games coming out. Xbox One X is a thing.
733000	737000	So, I mean, gaming changes that fast. Technology shifts that fast.
737000	740000	So it's a little bit tongue in cheek that we do this segment.
740000	747000	But, you know, man, I don't know how many of you guys go back and listen to old Orange Lounge radios.
747000	753000	But some of the shit that comes out of our mouths about predictions and things like that.
753000	757000	And just, you know, if only we knew then what we knew now, it's crazy.
757000	758000	All right. So anyway, let's get to it.
758000	766000	So a few months ago, we put away in this time capsule some I think some questions or some statements about what are we going to discover in 2018.
766000	768000	And tonight we will be filling it back up.
768000	774000	Not only with our comments, but some of yours in our chat as well over at live.vognetwork.com.
774000	778000	So I think the best way to do this. So I'm going to take our Vader time capsule here and I'm going to open up his head.
778000	782000	And I'm going to pull one thing out and then I'll pass it around.
782000	784000	Each person can pull something out. This is only fun.
784000	786000	Oh, my God. This thing is full.
786000	788000	Maybe we are going to have a three hour show tonight.
788000	789000	I don't remember.
789000	791000	We're into this kind of quick.
791000	793000	All right. So somebody wrote this down.
794000	796000	This looks like Matt's handwriting.
796000	798000	Skyrim remastered.
798000	803000	Oh, I think these are the three games you like right now.
803000	805000	Why do we have three games randomly written down?
805000	806000	Well, here's the thing.
806000	811000	You put Skyrim remastered until dawn rush of blood Skyrim remastered.
811000	814000	So I think these are like the games we were playing over the summer.
814000	817000	Top three games so far of the year.
817000	818000	Oh, am I supposed to do that?
818000	819000	Should we do that again?
819000	820000	I don't.
820000	822000	Let's do that. But that's actually right where they are.
822000	824000	There's only been like a week's worth of games.
824000	826000	All right. I'm going to do two.
826000	828000	I mean, our top three for the last year.
828000	829000	Last year.
829000	830000	We can do that. Sure.
830000	831000	All right.
831000	832000	Cool.
832000	833000	I have one less thing I have to think of.
833000	834000	Label it as that.
834000	835000	All right.
835000	836000	I'm going to open two.
836000	839000	So this other one says, oh, I wrote this.
839000	843000	Did any accessories go down in price yet?
843000	845000	And that was signed Dungeon Buster and Rob.
845000	846000	So he must have said something in chat.
846000	848000	Did any accessories go down in price yet?
848000	851000	I think he's talking about the Switch accessories.
851000	853000	Because they were all expensive.
853000	857000	Well, they discontinued a Microsoft accessory this week.
857000	858000	Sort of. Sort of.
858000	859000	We'll get into that later.
859000	860000	Not going down in price.
860000	863000	No, the Switch accessory sure as hell didn't go down in price.
863000	864000	That's for sure.
864000	867000	They're still releasing new colors and new schemes and all that stuff.
867000	868000	So I don't know.
868000	869000	Scheme is the right word for that.
869000	870000	Yeah, there you go.
870000	872000	All right. Pick a couple out of these here, Loki, and read them for us.
872000	873000	OK, let's see.
873000	875000	All right.
878000	880000	It's only got one piece.
880000	881000	One big piece.
881000	883000	Somebody shoved a whole piece of paper in there.
883000	885000	Is that Jamie?
885000	887000	This is mine.
887000	888000	All right, what'd you put?
888000	892000	OK, so this is what I put as, yep, it has my name on it.
892000	893000	OK.
893000	894000	Of course it's mine.
894000	896000	Oh, we did this back in March.
896000	897000	I thought it was in June.
897000	898000	Oh, I thought it was in the summer.
898000	899000	No, March 5th.
899000	900000	OK, so it almost is here.
900000	901000	We dated it.
901000	902000	All right.
902000	903000	OK.
903000	905000	I bet they delayed Super Mario Odyssey.
905000	907000	So you were wrong on that.
907000	909000	I bet the system is hacked already.
909000	911000	You're actually kind of right on that.
911000	912000	Yeah.
912000	913000	But, I mean, come on.
913000	915000	That was a Captain Obvious thing to say.
915000	918000	I bet their online service is shit.
918000	920000	Well, I was wrong because it hasn't come out yet.
920000	928000	Yeah, I think that we need to do, like, our favorite three games of last year and then our predictions.
928000	929000	Sure.
929000	930000	Yeah, so let's do it that way.
930000	934000	No less than two Wii U remakes announced at E3.
934000	938000	Not at E3, but we got Bayonetta 2.
938000	939000	Technically, yes.
939000	941000	So technically there's Bayonetta.
941000	946000	Do we get any other remake announcements at E3?
946000	948000	There's been a lot of games that have been ported to the Switch.
948000	950000	I don't think those are remakes necessarily, though.
950000	951000	Yeah, no.
951000	952000	So you got one.
952000	953000	You got one or two.
953000	954000	And no F-Zero.
954000	957000	Well, that was, again, Captain Obvious thing to make.
957000	958000	All right.
958000	959000	Let's pass them on to Jamie.
959000	961000	Let's make her do a few.
961000	963000	It's almost like you had all this pent up rage for no reason for Nintendo.
963000	964000	I know.
964000	965000	All right.
965000	966000	Oh, Pokken.
966000	967000	Thank you, Act F.
967000	968000	Thank you, Act F.
968000	969000	Pokken was E3.
969000	970000	Oh.
970000	971000	Thank you, Act F.
971000	972000	Pokken is Pokken 2.
972000	973000	This was me.
973000	974000	Sort of.
974000	978000	I guess these were the games I've been playing.
978000	979000	Okay.
979000	983000	So I said World of Warcraft Legion, which I've played through part of the year.
983000	984000	But then you've since stopped.
984000	985000	Yeah.
985000	986000	And now I'm playing it.
986000	987000	Danganronpa 2.
987000	988000	Okay.
988000	989000	Which I still haven't finished.
989000	990000	And Breath of the Wild.
990000	991000	Okay.
991000	993000	Which you're kind of still, you have the DLC, right?
993000	995000	You and Dan have been kind of Pokken your way through that, right?
995000	996000	Yeah.
996000	997000	So I started on my Switch version.
997000	998000	Okay.
998000	999000	So.
999000	1002000	And then there's a few in here.
1002000	1003000	Okay.
1003000	1004000	This one's Rob's.
1004000	1005000	I guess it's what you're playing.
1005000	1007000	Final Fantasy XIV.
1007000	1009000	Overwatch with Alan.
1009000	1014000	And overcome with feelings about Andromeda PS.
1014000	1016000	Was the gay sex good?
1016000	1022000	Unfortunately, no, it was not until they patched in the JAWS stuff, I guess.
1022000	1024000	That's when you finally got.
1024000	1026000	So Rob, the answer is no, it wasn't very good.
1026000	1027000	Okay.
1027000	1028000	There's only a few more left in here.
1028000	1030000	I think there's three more in here, so we'll each pull one.
1030000	1031000	All right.
1031000	1035000	This one says.
1035000	1038000	This is a huge list.
1038000	1040000	JD's initials are on this too.
1040000	1041000	Oh, this might've come from chat.
1041000	1043000	Okay.
1043000	1044000	I don't even know what the hell.
1044000	1047000	Was he here during the time that we were recording?
1047000	1049000	I think this is from chat because there's a Dungeon Buster thing on here.
1049000	1050000	Oh, okay.
1050000	1053000	So I think this is Jamie's handwriting and she wrote six things here.
1053000	1055000	Virtual Console, Jamie.
1055000	1057000	Well, didn't happen.
1057000	1059000	We'll put that on 2018's list.
1059000	1062000	Augmented Reality, Jamie.
1062000	1068000	Actually, there's been a lot of talk of it from Apple.
1068000	1069000	Yeah.
1069000	1070000	From the developer's conference.
1070000	1073000	I mean, that's a really broad category.
1073000	1076000	So, you know, did we get HoloLens?
1076000	1078000	Not beyond the developer stuff.
1078000	1084000	But, you know, Pokemon Go incorporated AR even further into what they're doing on the phones.
1084000	1086000	So, you know, that's something.
1086000	1088000	JD put Mii support.
1088000	1090000	M-I-I support.
1090000	1095000	Well, you sort of can use the Miis on the Switch.
1095000	1097000	Your little avatars are Mii people.
1097000	1098000	Yeah.
1098000	1099000	All right.
1099000	1100000	Let's see.
1100000	1103000	Two months to Linux, said Jamie.
1103000	1104000	Oh, that must have been about the Switch.
1104000	1105000	Two months to Linux.
1105000	1107000	Which I don't think has happened.
1107000	1108000	No, it has not happened.
1108000	1109000	But they're getting close.
1109000	1111000	Stream plus video clips.
1111000	1113000	Jamie, again, I think that's about the Switch.
1113000	1115000	Also hasn't happened.
1115000	1116000	Well, no.
1116000	1117000	Video clips did.
1117000	1118000	So stream didn't.
1118000	1119000	Video clips did.
1119000	1120000	So half point there.
1120000	1122000	But this is like whose line is it anyway?
1122000	1123000	The points don't matter.
1123000	1127000	And then Dungeon Buster said EA and Ubisoft still committed.
1127000	1128000	Oh, that's a good one.
1128000	1131000	So are EA and Ubisoft still committed to the Switch?
1131000	1133000	Well, I think Ubisoft's a big yes.
1133000	1134000	Definitely, yes.
1134000	1135000	Definitely.
1135000	1137000	I mean, with Mario Rabbids was one of their big titles last year.
1137000	1141000	EA hasn't really done much other than their sports games, but we don't know for 2018 yet.
1141000	1146000	I feel like EA's kind of being bullied into it, which is fine.
1146000	1149000	Oh, something bad happening to EA.
1149000	1151000	Oh, that's just terrible.
1151000	1152000	All right.
1152000	1153000	I think there's only a couple left in here.
1153000	1154000	So, Loki, you can grab one.
1154000	1157000	We have to be more specific this time.
1157000	1159000	We're learning as we do this here at Orange Planet Radio.
1159000	1162000	And you can join us and chat at live.vognetwork.com.
1165000	1167000	I have no idea.
1167000	1168000	You wrote this one.
1168000	1169000	Me?
1169000	1170000	I think.
1170000	1173000	It says, did 45 get impeached?
1173000	1175000	I don't know.
1175000	1177000	No, I probably wrote that too.
1177000	1179000	Why do we put things forward about games?
1179000	1180000	I have no idea.
1180000	1181000	No, he did not.
1181000	1183000	No, he did not.
1183000	1184000	Damn shame.
1184000	1186000	But there's a book out, I mean, for what it's worth.
1186000	1187000	I'm not surprised at all.
1187000	1188000	I have listened to half that book.
1188000	1189000	It's pretty good.
1189000	1191000	I obtained it.
1191000	1192000	All right.
1192000	1193000	One more for Dark Soccer.
1193000	1194000	One more for Dark Soccer.
1194000	1196000	Yeah, there's a couple more in there.
1196000	1197000	I'll finish them up.
1197000	1198000	All right.
1198000	1204000	What I'm going to do for us is I think we do one of our game prediction, our games that
1204000	1206000	we're playing, and then we take a few things from the chat room.
1206000	1209000	Oh, Bobby in chat says, you must have listened to the show this week.
1209000	1214000	Bobby says, you put that one in at the very end as a secret to everyone.
1214000	1217000	You showed it to Jamie and she laughed, but you wouldn't read it to chat.
1217000	1218000	Oh, well, there you go.
1218000	1219000	Surprise.
1219000	1220000	Okay.
1221000	1222000	Okay.
1224000	1226000	I can't read your handwriting, Rob.
1226000	1227000	All right.
1227000	1228000	Then I'll do this one.
1228000	1229000	All right.
1229000	1232000	My handwriting says, did they bundle one to switch in yet?
1232000	1233000	No.
1233000	1235000	They didn't have to.
1235000	1238000	And this one's also your.
1238000	1240000	That didn't work out so well, did it?
1240000	1241000	Well, they didn't.
1241000	1244000	GameStop did.
1244000	1248000	Can we play virtual console online like they said on the website?
1248000	1249000	Nope.
1249000	1252000	Well, it seems headed that direction, but nope.
1252000	1258000	If by you mean virtual console, you mean illegally emulated games online, then yes, you can play
1258000	1260000	those online.
1260000	1261000	All right.
1261000	1267000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, JD in chat said, yeah, and it went on sale
1267000	1270000	for a bunch for Black Friday, talking about one to switch.
1270000	1271000	So that's something there.
1271000	1275000	I literally forgot about one to switch until it was just brought up just now.
1275000	1276000	All right.
1276000	1281000	So chatters over at live.vognetwork.com, what should we put in?
1281000	1283000	So time capsule's empty right now.
1283000	1284000	Okay.
1284000	1287000	So what goes in the time capsule for this year?
1287000	1289000	So we're supposed to put our top three games, right?
1289000	1291000	Because I didn't even put that in there yet.
1291000	1292000	Yeah.
1292000	1293000	So why don't you guys start.
1293000	1294000	Well, okay.
1294000	1303000	So my top three games for 2017 are Animal Crossing Pocket Camp, Danganronpa V3, and
1303000	1304000	Mass Effect Andromeda.
1304000	1307000	I really have nothing else.
1307000	1308000	So.
1308000	1309000	All right.
1309000	1310000	They're going in.
1310000	1311000	Put it in there.
1311000	1312000	All right.
1312000	1314000	And, and Loki, did you, did you even think of three games?
1314000	1316000	I was kind of put on the spot.
1316000	1318000	Don't do like a huge sheet of paper so we can get everything to fit.
1318000	1319000	Oh, okay.
1319000	1320000	We'll all rip these apart.
1320000	1321000	So that's fine.
1321000	1322000	It's fine.
1322000	1323000	I've got more than three actually.
1323000	1324000	So go for it.
1324000	1326000	Um, just the completely obvious safe answer.
1326000	1332000	The AAA gaming industry will continue to fuck up games using, we're doing our top three
1332000	1333000	games.
1333000	1337000	Oh, well that's still a game because it's the industry fucking thing as well.
1337000	1339000	And my top three games of this year.
1339000	1341000	Um, Loki's like, I didn't understand the assignment.
1341000	1342000	I wasn't listening.
1342000	1347000	I was writing, um, top three games of this year.
1347000	1348000	That's a tough one.
1348000	1349000	Cause I didn't play much.
1349000	1360000	Um, I would probably say, uh, South Park, um, the Fractured But Whole and then, uh,
1360000	1371000	still Skyrim remastered and um, gosh, I don't know.
1371000	1373000	Like I really didn't play that much.
1373000	1377000	Um, I have no idea.
1377000	1385000	I'm just going to put two and the AAA industry fucking over everything as my game number
1385000	1386000	three.
1386000	1387000	Well, that's a given captain obvious.
1387000	1388000	All right.
1388000	1396000	I'm going to put in my list here and I kind of had to, sorry, I kind of had to do this
1396000	1399000	fast and I didn't really think analytically about this.
1399000	1402000	Um, but I put number one, Super Mario Odyssey, that's a given.
1402000	1406000	I put number two, Breath of the Wild and I went ahead and put number three, Final Fantasy
1406000	1407000	14, Stormblood.
1407000	1411000	I mean, I know that's kind of obvious for me, but I really liked the story and the expansion.
1411000	1415000	Like seriously, I know a lot of people haven't really enjoyed it, but the story and the expansion
1415000	1416000	is so good.
1416000	1418000	I like better than some of the mainline Final Fantasy games.
1418000	1420000	So that's just kind of what came to mind.
1420000	1422000	And obviously a game I played an awful lot this year.
1422000	1424000	So I'll go ahead and put that in there.
1424000	1425000	Don't forget chatters.
1425000	1429000	We want your suggestions over at live.vognetwork.com.
1429000	1434000	Uh, Bobby black will suggest put time to car is number three cause you've played it and
1434000	1435000	we have it.
1435000	1436000	So that is true.
1436000	1437000	I have accepted.
1437000	1439000	It's not really played label your thing.
1439000	1440000	Didn't you Rob?
1440000	1441000	Yes, I did.
1441000	1442000	Okay.
1442000	1443000	I put 2017 top three.
1443000	1444000	Okay.
1444000	1445000	Okay.
1445000	1448000	So let's start with some of these other slips here.
1448000	1449000	Okay.
1449000	1452000	So, um, I have to kind of rip this one up funny.
1452000	1453000	All right.
1453000	1455000	Here's my prediction or one of my predictions.
1455000	1463300	2018 will Microsoft jealous of Nintendo's sales this holiday, Jack the switch concept,
1463300	1467680	but for PC as well, the Nvidia shield is already halfway there.
1467680	1468680	After all.
1468680	1469680	I wrote a lot on that.
1469680	1470680	Sorry.
1470680	1475920	So at the end of the day, I'm asking will Microsoft jealous of the switches success,
1475920	1482480	Jack, the concept for themselves, the reason I think that will not to say that I couldn't
1482480	1485800	do that, but they have, wouldn't be the first time they've taken a good idea, but they have
1485800	1488720	a tablet device pretty much already with their surface tablets.
1488720	1489720	True.
1489720	1494000	So they'd probably try to push that as a gaming platform versus, you know, cause you can do
1494000	1498120	X-Box anywhere type stuff, but yeah, it would be nice if another company did that.
1498120	1500400	All right, Jamie, how about one for you?
1501160	1503000	I didn't do them as like questions.
1503000	1507640	I just did one more third party switch support like SNK, Konami, et cetera.
1507640	1510040	So will we see more switch third party support?
1510040	1511040	Yeah.
1511040	1512040	I like that.
1512040	1513520	Because it's really not super heavy right now.
1513520	1517880	And we actually have some rumors tonight about Konami possibly stepping it up even more with
1517880	1518880	switch.
1518880	1523920	So number two, Konami learns from Capcom and listens to fans because, you know, Capcom
1523920	1525640	is doing Mega Man 11.
1525640	1526640	True.
1526640	1527640	So true.
1527880	1531880	And number three, I will continue to be very disappointed by the gaming industry as a whole.
1534880	1535880	All right.
1535880	1536880	Loki.
1536880	1544000	Aside from the one I already mentioned, I said the X-Box One X and PlayStation 4 Plus
1544000	1545840	don't sell well.
1545840	1546840	Okay.
1546840	1548840	That we'll see new...
1548840	1552440	Don't you think it's a little late for the PS4 Plus prediction?
1552440	1553840	Cause that was last year.
1553840	1554840	Was it?
1554840	1555840	Yeah.
1555840	1557120	It's been, that's been out a while.
1557600	1558600	But it'll still continue not to sell well.
1558600	1560080	I don't know if it's even selling well.
1560080	1562080	I assume it's not because...
1562080	1563080	Why?
1563080	1568880	Well, I, I kind of think the Plus is just quietly taking the place as the default console,
1568880	1569880	but...
1569880	1570880	All right.
1570880	1571880	No, I mean, it's fine.
1571880	1576720	It's not like it's still didn't like, Oh, I got to have it because it's so amazing.
1576720	1582680	I said that new second gen VR headsets this year.
1582680	1584120	Okay.
1584120	1590480	And the bold prediction, but maybe safe prediction, no Final Fantasy 7 remake and no Kingdom Hearts
1590480	1591480	3 this year.
1591480	1594040	Oh, so both those games not happening in 2018.
1594040	1595040	Not happening.
1595040	1596040	All right.
1596040	1597040	That's the prediction.
1597040	1598040	Oh, sorry.
1598040	1599440	One last one.
1599440	1602640	Nintendo will stop production of the 3DS and 2DS.
1602640	1603640	Okay.
1603640	1605160	Now those are some predictions, Loki.
1605160	1606160	I like those.
1606160	1607160	All right.
1607160	1610160	So chat room, message me one prediction.
1610160	1615600	I will take the top five and I will only take them via message, not said in the chat
1615600	1616600	room.
1616600	1617600	All right.
1617600	1618600	Why is that?
1618600	1619600	Because...
1619600	1620600	That would be a surprise.
1620600	1621600	Because I want people to fucking listen.
1621600	1622600	All right.
1622600	1626960	I still have more.
1626960	1630740	I had one more that I wanted to put in there.
1630740	1634880	The next prediction I said is, did Anthem flop?
1634880	1640200	You know that we've had a lot of things to say about how EA handled Mass Effect.
1640200	1644200	EA is further under the spotlight for this whole loot box thing.
1644200	1647640	You know they've planned for Anthem to have loot boxes in one way or another.
1647640	1648640	This game is already in development.
1648640	1651800	Why not put them all in one form so that we don't have a bunch of little papers in there?
1651800	1653800	Because I didn't think of it.
1653800	1654800	Yeah.
1654800	1661220	We need a project manager for the time capsule.
1661220	1662360	So I put, did Anthem flop?
1662360	1665240	Do I have to put my top three games on a piece of paper?
1665240	1666240	Or did you already do that?
1666240	1667240	One single piece of paper.
1667240	1668240	Yeah.
1668240	1669240	You can do it on one single piece of paper.
1669240	1670240	All right.
1670240	1671240	Stop sending me suggestions.
1671240	1672240	I have more than enough.
1672240	1673240	All right.
1673240	1676440	Now I do like this suggestion from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1676440	1679440	This is before you started saying something, Jamie.
1679440	1685760	Bobby says, based on the games that you know are coming out in 2018, what do you think
1685760	1691920	your top three will be when you open the time capsule next year?
1691920	1697360	There's so many games they just don't announce until E3.
1697360	1698360	That's hard.
1698360	1699360	I can already name a few.
1699360	1700360	Okay.
1700360	1703760	Do you want to write them down and put at the top, um, were these my favorite games
1703760	1704760	2018?
1704760	1705760	Question mark.
1705760	1707400	I'm out of paper, but yeah, sure.
1707400	1708400	I should hear it.
1708400	1709400	It's all good.
1709400	1710400	It's all good.
1710400	1711400	Hey everybody.
1711400	1716060	I have to throw stuff away because you're terrible.
1716060	1718880	So what, what games are you going to put on there, Loki?
1718880	1721600	I'm going to put on the, well, we're going to get to it later.
1721600	1724640	A certain remake of a certain racing game from a certain criterion.
1724640	1726240	Um, fair enough.
1726240	1737920	I am going to put red dead redemption two and, and number three is gonna be tough.
1737920	1743440	I don't know, cause I don't know what other games are going to be coming out.
1743440	1745640	I'm going to hope for a new elder scrolls game.
1745640	1746640	That's never going to happen.
1746640	1750760	Um, I'm going to put Metroid prime four.
1750760	1752320	I think that's a gimme for me.
1752320	1755440	So Metroid prime four, did I enjoy in 2018?
1755440	1763080	Number two, I'm going to put, um, I think the Bayonetta remakes too easy because we
1763080	1764780	know how those games are.
1764780	1774000	So I'm going to, I'm going to be bold and say earth bound or no mother three because
1774000	1775160	who knows what that is going to happen.
1775160	1776160	Ooh, I know.
1776160	1783440	Number three, I'm going to put secret of mana remaster.
1783440	1786040	Secret of mana is on steam right now.
1786040	1787040	Yeah.
1787040	1789240	But you know, you know how they're doing that remaster.
1789240	1791640	I think it's only about a month away on PS4.
1791640	1792940	I'm really looking forward to that.
1792940	1797920	So I'm going to, uh, I think it's also on steam to be fair, but I know PS4 is the console
1797920	1803640	platform they're going with with that, uh, tiger claw and chat says sending me suggestions.
1803640	1805160	I've got plenty.
1805160	1807440	Tiger claw and chat says, what about F zero?
1807440	1811040	Do you think 2018 will be the year for a new F zero on the switch?
1811040	1812040	No, I do not.
1812040	1813040	Sadly.
1813040	1814700	And it pains me to say that, but no, I do not.
1814700	1816720	So that's why I'm not putting that in.
1816720	1818360	All right.
1818360	1819360	What else is left?
1819360	1821760	Jamie, do you want to read some of these chat things we're putting in?
1821760	1822760	Not yet.
1822760	1827320	I know the, another game that I could be looking forward to next or this year, um, which I
1827320	1829400	hopefully it's going to be making its way out this year.
1829400	1831680	I know that they're working on Borderlands three.
1831680	1834280	There you go.
1834280	1835280	I'd be done with that.
1835280	1836280	There you go.
1836280	1837280	That's a good one for your list.
1837280	1838280	What about you guys in our chat over at live?
1838280	1839520	I think that we should leave.
1839520	1841160	I'm going to leave these five here.
1841160	1842160	A secret.
1842160	1843160	Oh, you're not even going to read them?
1843160	1844160	Nope.
1844160	1845440	Where's the fun in that?
1845440	1847200	Because it's the fun.
1847200	1848920	That means we have to make it through another year.
1848920	1849920	All right.
1849920	1850920	Did you put what chatters?
1850920	1851920	Yes, I did.
1851920	1852920	Okay.
1852920	1853920	All right.
1853920	1857000	I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1857000	1858600	Bobby says four is a horizon.
1858600	1861760	Four is most likely coming because they pretty much verified that the four is a series as
1861760	1866520	a yearly series splitting between motorsport and horizon in 2018 as a horizon year.
1866520	1867520	Well, that's good to know.
1867520	1870840	Um, that'll be really good on, that might be the game that finally pushes me to get
1870840	1871840	an Xbox one X.
1871840	1872840	We'll see.
1872840	1873840	Um, tiger claw.
1873840	1875400	Except you can just play it on PC.
1875400	1876640	Yeah, I guess that's true.
1876640	1880840	Tiger claw in chat says in 2018, I want to see a new Ninja Turtles game from Rocksteady.
1880840	1884760	If Ninja Turtles is coming to injustice two, isn't the indication there's that.
1884760	1885760	All right.
1885760	1888080	Anything else for the time capsule?
1888080	1890400	Now that Jamie has put in the chat room comments.
1890400	1891400	All right.
1891400	1894320	Going once, going twice.
1894320	1898040	Do we need something that isn't related to gaming?
1898040	1899920	Oh yes, no, I do.
1899920	1902800	I want to put one thing that's very important and this actually ties into something we're
1902800	1904280	going to talk about next week.
1904280	1905280	Okay.
1905280	1908440	Like maybe we should each put our one top secret social prediction.
1908440	1910240	No, I'll read this one out loud.
1910240	1911240	It's fine.
1911240	1914320	Well, mine's going to be top secret because it's my prerogative.
1914320	1915320	Okay.
1915320	1917760	I'm writing.
1917760	1921520	Did Rob finally rage quit ingress?
1921520	1928280	I reached quit for a while, remember as Rob takes me around to like a portal on the way
1928280	1929280	here.
1929280	1930280	Yeah.
1930280	1931280	Right.
1931280	1932280	It was pretty cool though.
1932280	1933280	Jamie, when you take a detour.
1933280	1934280	All right.
1934280	1935280	True.
1935280	1936280	All right.
1936280	1937280	And I put mine on gaming one, which is still sort of gaming.
1937280	1938280	Ready?
1938280	1939280	Player one didn't suck.
1939280	1942320	All right.
1942320	1943320	Anything else?
1943320	1944320	Dark soccer.
1944320	1945320	You go.
1945320	1946320	Oh, you're keeping it a secret.
1946320	1947320	Yeah.
1947880	1948880	And then we'll seal it up.
1948880	1949880	Where's the lid?
1949880	1950880	Where's the lid?
1950880	1951880	Oh, here.
1951880	1952880	Here it is.
1952880	1954880	Seal it a little way.
1954880	1958000	Bury it underground where Mr. Smoosh won't find it.
1958000	1961000	And there it is.
1961000	1965800	All right.
1965800	1968320	Going to chat over at livetopvognetwork.com.
1968320	1972200	Azett just joined chat saying, no, he just sent me on an errand actually.
1972200	1974200	And that's, that's about ingress.
1974200	1978260	But I haven't rage quit yet.
1978260	1982160	Today was pretty good, but I've had my days where I'm like, this is, this is it.
1982160	1983160	I'm done.
1983160	1984160	Yeah.
1984160	1985160	I pulled it up this near this afternoon.
1985160	1986160	I was like, Oh, Hey.
1986160	1987160	Yeah.
1987160	1988560	We had a little James Bond day today.
1988560	1989560	It was fun.
1989560	1990560	All right.
1990560	1992020	Seal it up.
1992020	1995880	By the way, next week is going to be a very ingress heavy show because if you've never
1995880	1997280	played the game, that's okay.
1997280	2003040	Because we're going to have some very fun ladies who really do a lot with the game and
2003040	2006160	the community here in Sacramento are going to be here on the show next week.
2006160	2008960	So it's kind of a, it's kind of a lady gamer takeover next week.
2008960	2009960	It's going to be a lot of fun.
2009960	2010960	Hell yeah.
2010960	2012160	So tune in for that live.
2012160	2013160	And Estrafest.
2013160	2014160	Oh boy.
2014160	2015160	All right.
2015160	2016160	All right.
2016160	2018280	Oh girl, as the case may be.
2018280	2023800	Anyway, uh, let's, I'm looking to chat over at live.vognetwork.com just for a couple more
2023800	2024800	here.
2024800	2031360	Uh, Tiger Caw in chat says in 2018, uh, solo, a star Wars story was the best star Wars movie
2031360	2032360	ever.
2032680	2033680	That movie is going to be shit.
2033680	2034680	I don't know.
2034680	2035680	Let's see.
2035680	2038480	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, I hope my 4k home theater I'm building is everything I want
2038480	2042320	it to be and more had the builder here two days ago taking measurements.
2042320	2043320	We'll see.
2043320	2044320	We'll see.
2044320	2045320	All right.
2045320	2050100	The time capsule is locked away and we will open that up new year's next year, which means
2050100	2052820	we basically committed to another year of OLR.
2052820	2054280	So there you go.
2054280	2055280	All right.
2055280	2058440	Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this
2058440	2059440	week.
2059440	2060440	No predictions here.
2060440	2061440	Just facts.
2061520	2063920	I actually want to bring up something else real quick before you get to your gaming weeks,
2063920	2064920	right?
2064920	2069280	Um, well, not to be a big downer, um, although I've been all over my social media with it,
2069280	2079000	but my, um, my stepdad who I actually like better than my real dad, um, died on Christmas
2079000	2084600	Eve complications to a idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
2084600	2087320	It means that your lungs filled with fibrous tissue and you can't breathe.
2087320	2093600	And he was in Gainesville for his double lung transplant and died after the first day of
2093600	2095600	testing.
2095600	2099000	And so my mother has no job.
2099000	2101400	Um, she has no income right now.
2101400	2107060	She can't collect anything until she turned 60, which is 11 months away.
2107060	2112620	So I've started a GoFundMe to try to help raise money for my mother to help her keep
2112620	2113860	her head above water.
2113860	2117740	You know, I've got, we've so far raised enough to give her a month of her rent.
2117740	2121340	I would like to at least cover three months of rent for her.
2121340	2125140	Um, and it's not just me saying, oh, everyone else give money.
2125140	2131420	I've actually taken over about two or three of my mother's bills so that she at least
2131420	2137500	can have, you know, her phone and her internet and basic, you know, pay for her car.
2137500	2138500	I understand.
2138500	2141780	This is you looking out for a parent in any way you possibly can.
2141780	2144220	Like I don't think anybody can blame me for that.
2144220	2148980	And so I'm even going to go out on a limb and I'm going to do something that's a lot
2148980	2151940	of pride swallowing here.
2151940	2162660	If I can either get one person to donate $500 or two people to do $250 or five people to
2162660	2163660	do $100.
2163660	2170940	And you have to say in the comment when you donate that it's for halo.
2170940	2177020	This means that if I get that goal reached, I will do halo as classic game of the week.
2177020	2180380	I'm completely said that during the time capsule thing.
2180380	2181380	Dang it.
2181380	2182820	Oh, did, did she finally do halo?
2182820	2183820	Yeah.
2183820	2186060	I will do halo as classic game of the week.
2186060	2192860	And on top of that, I will talk at length about halo and halo.
2192860	2193860	Go for gold.
2193860	2195300	Yeah, I'll play halo that night.
2195300	2196300	Awesome.
2196300	2199180	But I'll have to do it over here cause I have the halo.
2199180	2200260	We'll have to fudge it a little bit.
2200260	2202140	I have the halo collection on Xbox one.
2202140	2207820	I who have never played halo will play halo on stream.
2207820	2211260	All right, good.
2211260	2217100	And also I am planning on doing a marathon as soon as I've healed up a little bit more
2217100	2220180	and I'm not going to do it during awesome games done quick because that's unfair to
2220180	2222380	me and them.
2222380	2226900	But I want to do a stream where basically you donate 20 bucks, you pick the game out
2226900	2229300	of my collection that I play.
2229820	2232020	Which unfortunately halo is not in the collection.
2232020	2233020	So it does have to be something.
2233020	2235660	It's in the collection, but I'm going to do like per system.
2235660	2236660	Okay.
2236660	2241100	Like, you know, you, if you want me to switch systems, then you know, a little bit more
2241100	2242100	of a donation.
2242100	2243420	I'm just saying no cheating on the halo thing.
2243420	2248140	No, no, but, um, but that means I have to get the thing hooked up to the CRT so that
2248140	2251020	I don't have weird lag playing the guardian legend or something.
2251020	2252020	All right.
2252020	2256140	You know, and hey, if you want to donate more for a game I loathe, then fuck.
2256140	2257140	All right.
2257140	2258780	50 bucks for Zelda 2.
2258780	2261740	You have somebody in chat saying right now I'm in for a hundred.
2261740	2262740	Where's the link?
2262740	2263740	All right.
2263740	2265540	So the link is one down four to go.
2265540	2267740	I'm going to post it in chat.
2267740	2268740	Oh boy.
2268740	2270020	I think she's going to have to do it.
2270020	2275260	But what I'm doing right now is I'm even, let me actually get the link first cause um,
2275260	2280260	but then I'm also going to put it on my Twitter, which is at dark Sakura.
2280260	2281260	Okay.
2281260	2283900	Um, but I will say it aloud.
2283900	2291740	It's gofundme.com slash Michael dash mom is the link and I will put it in chat right
2291740	2292740	now.
2292740	2296500	And that's M I C H A E L cause I know there's a million different spellings of Michael out
2296500	2297740	there.
2297740	2299620	And oh, I definitely got it.
2299620	2305500	But um, but just in the comments, you know, keep track cause you have friends and family
2305500	2306500	and non OLR.
2306500	2311020	But I would appreciate you leaving a word of encouragement to my mother cause she, it's
2311020	2317300	two weeks today that Michael died and she's really in a lot of pain there by herself.
2317300	2321120	She's had to go through all of this stuff cause he was a pack rat and she was even saying
2321120	2324500	that she was putting stuff away and thinking, Michael's going to be pissed when he gets
2324500	2325540	home.
2325540	2328780	And then, you know, cause he's been in the hospital so much.
2328780	2336300	So um, but even if you just want to give like five bucks or 10 or you know, whatever, every
2336300	2338100	little bit is going to help.
2338100	2341180	And if we can get my mom at least three months of rent, that should be enough time for her
2341180	2342180	to find some work.
2342180	2343180	All right.
2343180	2344180	Well, good luck to you in that.
2344180	2345180	Thank you.
2345180	2347260	I know it's, I know that asking them for money is not always the most pleasant thing to do,
2347260	2350740	but I think, you know, again, you are looking out for a parent and I think a lot of people
2350740	2352140	in your situation would do the exact same thing.
2352140	2356420	And on top of that, she's 3000 miles away, so there's not much I can do other than this.
2356420	2357420	Right.
2357420	2358420	Okay.
2358420	2364380	So, um, but my mom, I told my mom I was going to do this and she, you know, she even said,
2364380	2366860	thank y'all in advance for whatever you do.
2366860	2367860	Yeah.
2367860	2368860	That's my mom.
2368860	2371860	I mean, we can probably call my mother and say, Hey, you know, you want to say something
2371860	2374700	to everybody, but I'll ask her first.
2374700	2379540	But yeah, but thank you guys for, for everything that you're doing to help my mom out.
2379540	2380900	We, we argue about stuff.
2380900	2386220	We don't always see eye to eye, but she's my mama and she's a nice lady most of the
2386220	2387220	time.
2387220	2389220	So thank you guys.
2389220	2390220	All right.
2390220	2392980	Well, let's shift gears a little bit and talk about your gaming week.
2392980	2394260	Do you want me to have you go first?
2394260	2395740	Do you want me to kick it to Loki so you can?
2395740	2399660	I can go first and I'll put that, I'll let everyone know when I posted on Twitter.
2399660	2407660	Um, but I'll be honest, I've been in a lot of pain, so I didn't really play a whole lot,
2407660	2412700	but um, I did play some Dragon Age Inquisition just because it's kind of like, it's kind
2412700	2416060	of comfort food for me is playing Dragon Age.
2416060	2417060	Sure.
2417060	2423980	And, um, yeah, and a little bit of Danganronpa V3, although I, I lost my progress.
2423980	2432100	Um, holy shit, Raginator, if I can get to $2,500 during the Halo segment, I will say
2432100	2434540	that Halo is my, I'll lie.
2434540	2435540	Sure.
2435540	2436540	2,500 bucks.
2436540	2439420	I'll say that Halo is my favorite game and it's the greatest game ever.
2439420	2441780	How much to sell her soul, $2,500.
2441780	2445100	And then I'll also say it's a fucking lie, but I'm saying it for money.
2445100	2446100	All right.
2446100	2447700	Anyway, let's, let's get back to games.
2447700	2448700	Yeah.
2448700	2449700	Yeah.
2449700	2453780	And also, but by the way, anyone who does donate something, I also will give you a personalized
2453780	2455860	thank you on my social media.
2455860	2456860	That's nice.
2456860	2461620	So, um, but yeah, so, um, we started Breath of the Wild together again on Switch.
2461620	2463340	Like starting, Oh, starting over with Switch.
2463340	2468620	And Dan also started the, the trial of the Master Sword and then was like, fuck this.
2468620	2471100	It is some bullshit, you know?
2471100	2478700	Um, so we've been, we've been getting our Switch gaming on cause mostly, and I mean
2478700	2484580	with the type of surgery I had, I have to lay out kinda, thank you already, by the way,
2484580	2485580	first donation came in.
2485580	2492260	Um, but, uh, I, I have to lay kind of flat sometimes because of my, where I was operated
2492260	2494160	on hurts a lot.
2494160	2500500	And so, um, Dan will play, uh, play Zelda and I'll be his navigator.
2500500	2504400	And so we'll do the puzzles together and things like that and look for things that we missed
2504400	2508180	and try to find, you know, stuff that he didn't find on the Wii U version.
2508180	2513700	And then, um, we've been watching a lot of, um, uh, what's his name from Game Sack, The
2513700	2515740	Ginger Guy.
2515740	2521180	Game Sack is one of my favorite, um, uh, video shows on YouTube right now, just for gaming
2521180	2522180	really.
2522180	2526800	In fact, I'd probably say that one and, um, Battle of the Ports are my two favorites right
2526800	2527800	now.
2527800	2531660	And I like, Did You Know Gaming and, uh, Beta64.
2531660	2532660	Those are my big ones right now.
2532660	2534660	Um, yeah, Dave, thank you.
2534660	2539700	Um, but I've been watching, um, we've been watching some of his streams on, on YouTube,
2539700	2543420	just the, the recorded streams and been pretty fun.
2543420	2549740	And, um, you know, kind of got me thinking about going back and playing some other older
2549740	2550740	games.
2550740	2552100	I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing though.
2552100	2553100	I'm almost level 52.
2553100	2556380	You should go dig up the GameCube and play the OG Animal Crossing.
2556380	2558220	I loaded that up on an emulator.
2558220	2559220	Okay.
2559220	2563060	Because I was going to do my little web comic using that and it's easier to screen cap in
2563060	2564360	the emulator.
2564360	2569520	But I could just do the, the double finger screen cap and I'll start a new game on Dan's
2569520	2571760	DS cause he's not using it.
2571760	2572760	Okay.
2572760	2578660	So, um, but yeah, it's, it's really, of course, Ingress today.
2578660	2579660	Thank you, Rob.
2579660	2580660	You're welcome.
2580660	2581660	And a little bit of Miitomo.
2581660	2587480	I'm kind of getting out of it now, but I like the outfits, excuse me, I've got hiccups.
2587480	2590240	Um, I played something else.
2590240	2591240	Oh yeah.
2591240	2593560	And I'm, I'm actually buying Hollow Knight tonight.
2593560	2598520	After having watched that speedrun, the game looks so fun and pretty that I think I need
2598520	2599520	that game in my life.
2599520	2600520	So, all right.
2600520	2601520	There it is.
2601520	2602520	Yeah.
2602520	2604520	Derek Socrates gaming week.
2604520	2605520	How about Loki?
2605520	2606520	How was your gaming week?
2606520	2608440	I finally got around to playing VR games.
2608440	2609440	Awesome.
2609440	2610440	VR game.
2610440	2611440	I should say it's something.
2611440	2615800	I played a super hot VR on the PlayStation VR and it's fun.
2615800	2616800	I like it.
2616800	2621560	The only issue I have with it, it's really just the PlayStation VR hardware, um, or I
2621560	2623880	shouldn't even say it's a PlayStation VR hardware.
2623880	2627960	It's more of the shitty ass PlayStation move controllers.
2627960	2634560	Um, throwing things seem to be very difficult to get accurate.
2634560	2640040	So like I try to throw, cause I know you can do it sometimes where you throw your gun from
2640040	2644960	one scene to the next scene, because if you haven't played the game, um, once you kill
2644960	2649340	all the, you know, the targets in the first part, it kind of teleports you to another
2649340	2653780	section of the stage and sometimes you can throw your gun that you have from one section
2653780	2659940	to the next section or like throw like a, you know, ball or ninja star or something
2659940	2663460	like that down where you think a person's going to be and then you'll hit them.
2663460	2668020	Um, so I tried doing that, but half the time when I went to throw something, it would just
2668020	2671820	kind of, it'd be like, there's no energy behind it.
2671820	2675880	I'd like, I'd throw it and it just kind of like falls down.
2675880	2679300	Like there's just none of the momentum there and other times it would work fine.
2679300	2681820	Or it worked fine in the completely wrong directions.
2681820	2685260	I'd throw it and it bounced off of nothing and just somehow go behind me.
2685260	2688060	I'm like, okay, that's not helpful at all.
2688060	2689060	But I had a lot of fun with it.
2689060	2690660	So I do like the game.
2690660	2696060	Um, I just wish the hardware worked better, but it's fun.
2696060	2697060	It's just hard.
2697060	2700620	Definitely very hard to play that because you're trying to look around to see where
2700620	2701620	things are.
2701620	2705020	But anytime you move your head, that's when everything's moving in the timeline.
2705020	2706460	It's super hot for those who haven't played it.
2706460	2709160	And I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with it.
2709160	2710160	Everything stands still.
2710160	2714880	If you're still, as soon as you move or do any action, everything in the time starts
2714880	2715880	moving.
2715880	2716880	So concept.
2716880	2717880	Yeah.
2717880	2718880	It's a neat concept.
2718880	2722920	So playing that in VR, you know, trying to get, you know, an idea of your surroundings,
2722920	2727300	you're moving your head and there's like things coming up on you and you fire a gun and everything's
2727300	2730300	moving, you know, for a little bit.
2730300	2736160	And so it's just, it's difficult in a fun way, I guess I kept trying to make sure it
2736160	2737160	wasn't hitting my TV.
2737160	2742800	But yeah, so I'm going to definitely dive into more VR stuff, but I was, you know, happy
2742800	2745480	to get to do that.
2745480	2749280	Play another game, which I unfortunately can't really give an impression on till later on.
2749280	2751980	So we'll just say it was hard.
2751980	2755320	And then I played just the usual cell phone stuff.
2755320	2758380	I've been playing a little bit of Ingress, a little bit of Pokemon Go, just kind of wherever
2758380	2763640	I'm at, you know, if it's a restaurant or, you know, the grocery store or something like
2763640	2765640	that, just hitting whatever's nearby.
2765640	2767600	That's about it.
2767600	2768600	Cool.
2768600	2774400	My gaming week, I have been playing World of Warcraft Legion still.
2774400	2777840	That's kind of my zen game right now, which is weird because I'm not very social in that
2777840	2778840	game.
2778840	2783280	I'm not really playing with anybody that I know, I kind of as a loner, I mean, some rando
2783280	2788480	guild picked me up and whatever, I just, I don't really do anything but steal the perks.
2788480	2793460	I leveled a druid on Horde side from one to 110 in the past couple of weeks.
2794180	2797540	And I've just been exploring some of the newer content they put in there, like the Argus
2797540	2799020	stuff and, you know, trying to catch up.
2799020	2800560	So it's kind of been interesting.
2800560	2806140	And then I started a shaman on Alliance side because I'd never played a shaman.
2806140	2808900	And I think my shaman is already up to level 38.
2808900	2813220	So you know, it's been just kind of like my zen game lately, kind of been playing that.
2813220	2814620	I did some streaming this weekend.
2814620	2819100	I played Super Mario World and that was a really fun stream because I got really frustrated.
2819620	2823780	My muscle memory kicked in in the weirdest places and I remembered how to get to the
2823780	2824940	star world.
2824940	2830380	And then with a little help from chat, I think I got to the cool world, special world where
2830380	2833500	all the stages are named like cool, awesome, and whatever.
2833500	2838180	And one of those stages like tubular or something like fucked me up, like it took me a long
2838180	2839360	time to get through it.
2839360	2843980	And so it was interesting because one of the chatters was like, this is the hardest stage.
2843980	2847860	And I beat it on like the second try, but then another stage just like ended me.
2847860	2851020	It was so, so awful, but it was a great, it was a great stream.
2851020	2853740	So I should probably finish that on stream at some point.
2853740	2855460	So that was fun.
2855460	2858540	And then I don't know if this is the game you were thinking of Loki, but I actually
2858540	2860940	asked the author if I could talk about it a little bit.
2860940	2862040	And the answer is yes.
2862040	2868060	So I played a little bit of, and we've talked about it on the show before, YYR is making
2868060	2871140	a new game and it's called super multitasking.
2871140	2873460	Now he's beta testing this game right now.
2873460	2876940	So he has invited some people to beta test it, which I'm assuming Loki's one of them.
2876940	2877940	And I'm one of them as well.
2877940	2880500	We just can't, we can't stream it until it's all ready to go.
2880500	2886380	Um, but he said we can talk about it a little bit and I, I, I'm telling you, there's a reason
2886380	2891820	why I brought him onto the phone to yell at him and tell him to put this game out because
2891820	2893340	it's, it's fun.
2893340	2899840	Like it's, it's incredibly hard, but it's, I did not realize like how, and for, if you
2899840	2904060	don't know what super multitasking is, it's basically the easiest way I can explain it.
2904060	2908460	Imagine you're playing WarioWare four places at once.
2908460	2913180	It's kind of what it is, kind, I'm oversimplifying it to tell you what it is, but it is the best
2913180	2914180	way I could say.
2914180	2916140	So you're playing like WarioWare four places at once.
2916140	2921820	So like the average game, honestly, if I get to two minutes, I've done a great job.
2921820	2927020	Like honestly, I was not, I was a little surprised at how fast the games go by, but that's actually
2927020	2931780	kind of a good thing because I do this whole one more, one more hit, one more sec, come
2931780	2933300	on, one more.
2933300	2937460	And so like I ended up playing it for a good hour the other day, just trying to keep beat
2937460	2938680	my score over and over.
2938680	2942340	So I, I, I think YYR is onto a good thing here.
2942340	2943340	Yeah.
2943340	2944580	So I'm excited for him to release the game.
2944580	2946620	So he did say he's looking for more people.
2946620	2951540	If you want to hit him up on Twitter, YYR, is it YYR underscore or underscore YYR?
2951540	2953540	I think it's YYR underscore.
2953540	2957140	And you can also visit his website at yyrgames.com.
2957140	2963260	So yeah, so super multi asking, I mean, what I played is mostly finished.
2963260	2966300	There are some bugs, but he kind of like already knows about them.
2966300	2970340	So, um, you know, he'll squash them and I'm sure the game will be out in a couple of months.
2970340	2971340	So that's going to be exciting.
2971340	2974160	Y'all got to support him when he puts that out because I'm really excited for him.
2974160	2975160	So thank you.
2975160	2981060	JD in chat says a YYR underscore and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I'm mad he made it
2981060	2986340	himself because I was going to make it myself and reap all that sweet, sweet indie game
2986340	2987340	cash.
2987340	2989380	So there you go.
2989380	2990500	So just an update.
2991420	2995820	Thank you to people who donated, although I forgot to mention, I need your Twitter handles
2995820	2998260	to give you the thank you.
2998260	3003660	But my mother, she says, please don't call them too emotional, but she says, please thank
3003660	3004660	them for me.
3004660	3005900	She's overwhelmed.
3005900	3006900	That's wonderful.
3006900	3007900	So thank you everybody.
3007900	3008900	Thanks everybody.
3008900	3009900	Who's able to help.
3009900	3010900	All right.
3010900	3015300	Tiger Han chat says you think we would see super multitasking in an AGD queue someday.
3015300	3016600	Imagine a speed run.
3016600	3019700	I think there's a speed run mode in there.
3019900	3024260	I don't know if it's something that can be speed run because that's kind of the point
3024260	3029260	is how long can you go, but I think it would be a great tournament game and he did build
3029260	3031220	a lot of that feature into it.
3031220	3034580	So I'm really excited for YYR.
3034580	3036380	Like I really hope this does good for him.
3036380	3042780	I think the one thing he might hear when the game gets released is that there's not enough
3042780	3047800	of the mini games because people are going to come from this place of WarioWare and so
3047800	3051040	forth where they're used to like 120 games and all this stuff.
3051040	3054920	But like considering YYR has basically done this himself, as far as I know, like I'm really
3054920	3056720	impressed with what he does.
3056720	3060800	And also I think it's worth pointing out that if there were that big of a variety, this
3060800	3062520	game's already fucking hard.
3062520	3068400	Like if there was even greater variety, I don't know that it would be doable.
3068400	3069800	So we'll see.
3069800	3070800	We'll see.
3070800	3074160	But I mean, I think, I don't know what he's going to end up ultimately charging for it,
3074160	3077640	but knowing him, he's, he's not going to overcharge for it.
3077640	3079680	And I think, I think it's going to do very well for him.
3079680	3083000	I planned the minute I can stream it, we're streaming it.
3083000	3085160	I was going to say, it's a great streaming game.
3085160	3093320	Like seriously, like I know I'm overhyping this a bit, but like PUBG, Minecraft, Five
3093320	3096440	Nights, that shit came out of nowhere and took off on streaming.
3096440	3097440	People like watching frustrating games.
3097440	3098440	Look at getting over it.
3098440	3099760	How popular that is with streamers.
3099760	3103160	I'm telling you, he has a chance.
3103160	3106740	It may not happen for him, but it might with the super multitasking.
3106740	3107740	So we'll see.
3107740	3108740	It's just got it.
3108740	3111680	The right people have to see it and the right people have to play it.
3111680	3114220	And it's going to happen because I think you're right.
3114220	3118580	People like to see people get frustrated and I'm not even streaming right now.
3118580	3121100	And I missed the fucking pong ball or something.
3121100	3122100	And I screamed at the monitor.
3122100	3125220	I was so mad because like I knew it was coming and I got so mad.
3125220	3129380	Well, I started like doing it like where it's two and two I can manage and also a third
3129380	3130380	one pops up.
3130380	3132700	I'm like, I can't do this.
3132700	3133700	That's too hard.
3133700	3134700	All right.
3134700	3138280	Jack Wolfenchat says he needs to add Twitch API stuff where the chat can throw in which
3138280	3139280	mini games show up.
3139280	3142820	Ooh, that's a really good, I mean, I think at this point he's too far along where he's
3142820	3147300	not going to add anything major, but he'll, he's, you know, especially if people really
3147300	3150420	take to the game, I think he's the type of guy that's going to be like, all right, what
3150420	3157800	can I do for super duper multitasking or super multitasking turbo tournament edition, super
3157800	3159900	third strike.
3159900	3160900	So anyway.
3160900	3161900	All right.
3161900	3162900	Good luck to YYR.
3162900	3164160	Nothing but great things about your game.
3164160	3167360	And I'm really excited to stream it, even though I'm going to be screaming a lot.
3167360	3168360	All right.
3168360	3171440	Um, for everybody else, it will be on steam eventually.
3171440	3172440	So keep an eye out.
3172440	3174520	I think there's a, because it was greenlit.
3174520	3177940	So I think there is a page already on steam where you can kind of follow it.
3177940	3182320	So you can go over there and check that out and then you can just follow YYR on Twitter
3182320	3183320	and all that stuff too.
3183320	3185040	And they don't have to go through the greenlight process anymore anyways.
3185040	3186040	So yeah.
3186040	3187760	Um, Oh yeah.
3187760	3192120	Bobby Lockwolf points out multitasking one was on Xbox live indie games.
3192120	3193120	That's right.
3193120	3195660	And he put it out just in time for the cutoff there.
3195660	3198020	And that's why this is super multitasking.
3198020	3201140	And I think he bumped it up from 12 games to 17 or something like that.
3201140	3203720	So he has already added new stuff into it.
3203720	3208000	So, but for many people, I mean, I think so many people miss the boat on the Xbox indie
3208000	3211360	games, especially as it was already being sunsetted and on the way out the door.
3211360	3213640	Anyway, I think this is going to be where most people find it.
3213640	3216580	So, all right, let us move on.
3216580	3218600	We need to get into some gaming news as well.
3218600	3222620	I don't have a lot of announcements here for housekeeping because as far as I know, we
3222620	3225220	have shows pretty much coming up through the next few weeks.
3225220	3228140	I'll be gone for a weekend in March, but that's over two months away.
3228140	3231500	So we'll, I'm going to drag con in May.
3231500	3232500	Are you going to drag con?
3232500	3233500	I'm going to drag con.
3233500	3234500	Nice.
3234500	3235500	I'm going to drag un-con again.
3235500	3239540	Actually, I should give a shout out to magfest because I know a lot of our listeners were
3239540	3242340	at magfest this weekend and I was, I was bummed.
3242340	3247380	I mean, there was a lot of problems with the hotels and all that stuff this year, but it
3247380	3252620	sounds like once people got to magfest this past weekend, everybody seemed to have a good
3252620	3255460	time and a lot of the feedback I'm seeing is very positive.
3255460	3258940	And I know there was some question marks with the whole fact the arcade game room was changing
3258940	3261620	as many things, but it sounds like magfest went really well.
3261620	3263420	So I was, I have to admit, I was a little jealous.
3263420	3264700	I didn't make it out there this year.
3264700	3266100	I mean, it is what it is.
3266100	3268460	Y'all know why I couldn't be there this year.
3268460	3274140	But I will hope that they work out some of their flaws so that I can come to magfest
3274140	3275140	2019.
3275140	3277100	I think that would be fantastic if that could be a thing.
3277100	3281660	So yeah, just shout out to those of you that were magfest, I'm sorry I missed it this year.
3281660	3283540	I was definitely sitting at home this weekend.
3283540	3287660	Like, I would see Ziba or SSG100mad or some of the people I know, they're like posting
3287660	3291900	pictures or whatever, and I just kind of do one of those, like, you know, not that I'm
3291900	3296900	like mad, but I'm just like, oh, I should be there now and I'm not, you know, but it
3296900	3297900	is what it is.
3297900	3303940	I'll be at Dragun Con and I'll be at, what other cons am I going to be at this year?
3303940	3306860	I'm trying to play.
3306860	3308220	Hopefully they do a Gamer X this year.
3308220	3310020	I'll definitely be in for that.
3310020	3311140	And who knows what else?
3311140	3312140	Stay tuned.
3312140	3313140	All right.
3313140	3314140	Let's get into some gaming news.
3314140	3315140	Loki.
3315140	3316140	All right.
3316140	3318980	Um, so let's talk a little bit about the Nintendo Switch.
3318980	3325180	So the Switch is the fastest home or selling home console in the US.
3325180	3330180	So it's sold apparently 4.8 million years over 10 months.
3330180	3334340	And this has already surpassed the mark that was set by the Switch, which sold 4 million
3334340	3337820	units during that same timeframe.
3337820	3341660	And I guess in December they announced that they had sold, uh, the 10 million units.
3341660	3347780	So, or they were, um, in Nintendo announced that they were selling 10 million units worldwide.
3347780	3354380	So 4.8 in the US and 10 million worldwide.
3354380	3358420	So Loki, you know, I got to needle you on this a little bit because when, uh, it comes
3358420	3362300	to being critical in Nintendo, you're usually, you know, one to speak up here on the show,
3362300	3366260	although you also, to be fair, you give them props or props or do as well.
3366260	3371700	I think you, you agree that Breath of the Wild is a fabulous game as is Mario Odyssey.
3371700	3375460	I don't think anybody, nobody's going to try to tell you it's debating that.
3375460	3379580	And I think a lot of our frustration when Nintendo comes from, Oh my God, there's these
3379580	3383980	things that other people are already doing and they're not like, they're, they're online
3383980	3384980	is so weird.
3384980	3388020	And all this stuff is like, it's like that frustration of like, this could be better,
3388020	3389020	but it's not.
3389020	3390300	But here we are, Loki.
3390300	3393140	Now these sales figures show doesn't matter.
3393140	3395140	Like it doesn't matter.
3395140	3396140	Yeah.
3396140	3397140	What's up with that?
3397140	3399020	How do you, how does this make you feel when you hear this?
3399020	3400020	It's still disappointing though.
3400020	3402060	Cause it really should matter.
3402060	3404440	It's not that, you know, it doesn't matter.
3404440	3409820	It's just, it's doing well regardless of they're online as well, but it could be doing even
3409820	3410820	better.
3410820	3413780	Well, just, there's no excuses at this point.
3413780	3416260	I mean like how well does it are behind her?
3416260	3421620	I got a needle a little further because does it show that maybe this stuff doesn't matter
3421620	3422680	to a lot of people?
3422680	3426860	Maybe online gaming doesn't matter to a lot of people, but it does though.
3426860	3427860	It does.
3427860	3428860	It does to me.
3428860	3430340	No, it does.
3430340	3432300	Because like Splatoon is a big game.
3432300	3437740	So let's do two or like, you know, Mario Kart eight or when it comes out, smash brothers,
3437740	3441100	if they're online is broken, that's going to hurt the game.
3441100	3446060	But online is working for those games you mentioned now, but yeah, but like, where's
3446060	3448960	the rest of the stuff that they promised?
3448960	3455500	Like I get it that like, they're not great at online, but dude, come on, make an attempt.
3455500	3457140	There's nothing.
3457140	3458260	There's no online right now.
3458260	3461700	There's no online service that they're, I mean, they have like the store and stuff,
3461700	3465180	but it's like, it's even more bare bones than the last console.
3465180	3469100	But Loki, I like, again, I'm not trying to be a Dick, but this story says it doesn't
3469100	3470220	matter.
3470220	3475840	It's sold more than any other system done.
3475840	3478660	Because people wanted Mario games and they wanted all the games.
3478660	3479660	What can I say?
3479660	3483380	You know, if you put those on the other call, would you, would you agree, meet me halfway
3483380	3488560	here and say that for the general populace out there, it Mario and Zelda is more important
3488560	3490080	than online.
3490080	3491120	Yes.
3491120	3495580	For some people, Mario and Zelda is more important, but they're going to need to keep having those
3495580	3500520	types of games because Mario and Zelda, they're going to get old after a while and you can
3500520	3502080	only play Mario Odyssey so much.
3502080	3506080	I mean, there's a lot of replayability there, but it's eventually you're going to hit the
3506080	3509080	end of that game and it's like, well then what else do I play?
3509080	3514160	So could there be, so maybe, and you know, maybe there is some method to the madness
3514160	3519120	here where some of these features are like peeling back the layers of the onion.
3519120	3522960	Like maybe this year, you know, the online, the full support with virtual console and
3522960	3525140	all that, that's going to be the next layer we get.
3525140	3528320	Or maybe finally freaking Netflix and all that other stuff.
3528320	3532060	Although they did get Hulu, so that's already kind of starting a little bit, but maybe more
3532060	3537540	of that, you know, and then it will peel back into, who knows, maybe a Switch deluxe, because
3537540	3542900	you know, this is Nintendo, you know, this will not be the only version of Switch that
3542900	3545740	there's going to be a Switch deluxe or a Switch 3D or so.
3545740	3546740	I don't know.
3546740	3547740	I'm making sure.
3547740	3550660	There's just a lot of frustrating things with their design and like some of it's really
3550660	3552860	good and some of it's really bad.
3552860	3556900	Like the really good part, like this is the design of the console is pretty nice.
3556900	3560260	The bad part, the storage on the console is pathetic.
3560940	3563540	Go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3563540	3567380	We have a couple of people, we have an anonymous chatter 287 saying online gaming doesn't matter
3567380	3568380	to me.
3568380	3570180	Bobby says online gaming doesn't matter to me either.
3570180	3575400	287 also says I stopped at Diablo 3 when it needed online activation.
3575400	3578300	You know, interesting that you bring that up though about Diablo 3, because it does
3578300	3581860	kind of go, you know, a lot of people were really ticked off about that and Blizzard
3581860	3583340	really had to scale that back.
3583340	3589020	Now the PC version still needs online activation, but Blizzard did ultimately release the PlayStation
3589020	3595740	3, 4, Xbox, you know, comparative versions that don't require any online.
3595740	3600100	And that's why people have like gold cheated the shit out of those games too, because they're
3600100	3601900	not online and people can kind of do that easier.
3601900	3602900	Who gives a shit?
3602900	3605940	Who gives a shit if they gold cheat the shit out of the offline game?
3605940	3609500	Yeah, if it's offline and they're in their own little island, let them do whatever the
3609500	3610500	fuck they want.
3610500	3611500	However they have fun with it.
3611500	3614980	It's when you go in with other people and fuck up their games too, when they may not
3614980	3617680	want that, they may want a pure quote unquote game.
3617680	3618680	That's when it's an issue.
3618680	3619920	But I get what you're saying.
3619920	3625080	But the problem is though, is if we let them just keep getting away with their online being
3625080	3629080	shitty, it's always going to be shitty and at some point it is going to matter.
3629080	3633040	And that's, that's my problem is like, get with the times.
3633040	3635080	All the other consoles are doing it just fine.
3635080	3636800	Why can't you be up there with them?
3636800	3641240	Fifth Dream in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Pokemon will sell so many switches.
3641240	3643600	Well that's, that's true.
3643600	3647440	I mean, they've got, we know Nintendo's got that coming this year when you ask, you know,
3647440	3650200	what are the big games on the Switch this year?
3650200	3651320	Maybe Metroid Prime.
3651320	3657600	I mean, maybe this year, but we know Pokemon is probably the tentpole fall release.
3657600	3661440	And so, and that's going to be huge for Nintendo.
3661440	3666400	I mean, even, and I'm not, I'm not like, you know, Shane levels of Pokemon obsessed.
3666400	3671800	Well Pokemon Go maybe, but, but you know, with Pokemon, uh, I'm so excited to check
3671800	3675040	out the Switch one because I think being able to play it on the TV, I think it is going
3675040	3676040	to make a difference.
3676040	3679680	And sit on the couch and chill and, you know, hunt shinies or whatever.
3679680	3686320	I don't, I don't like gaming on the 3DS a lot unless I am in a situation, you know,
3686320	3691280	if I took more mass transit or I was in that situation where I would need that more often,
3691280	3692920	I think I would, but I don't.
3692920	3695680	So anyway, you got a portable console.
3695680	3698240	I do because there's always, because then the games will come out for it.
3698240	3700240	Like how else would I play Samus Returns?
3700240	3701240	That's my only option right now.
3701240	3704120	There's still, there are still a lot of good games that come out on 3DS.
3704200	3706200	You're not talking about the Switch.
3706200	3707200	Oh, what do you mean?
3707200	3708440	Oh, of course I bought the Switch.
3708440	3711240	Yeah, because it's, it's a portable console basically.
3711240	3712720	Yeah, it's both.
3712720	3713720	Yeah.
3713720	3717680	I know Nintendo says most people are playing it in portable mode, but I'm playing it way
3717680	3720120	more in TV mode.
3720120	3725480	Although certainly I've had flights out back East, you know, and stuff this past couple,
3725480	3729840	you know, months where I do take the Switch and I played, I played Mario Odyssey on the
3729840	3731400	airplane not that long ago.
3731400	3733480	So I mean, it happens.
3733480	3738840	So anyway, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3738840	3742160	Actdeft in chat says Pokemon and Smash will consolidate the Switch.
3742160	3743440	You know, we never know.
3743440	3748480	Bobby Blackwil says I'll probably get Dragon Quest 11 because of the dual view going back
3748480	3752040	to the 3DS XL and you know why he likes it there.
3752040	3757080	287 in chat says this Pokemon on the Switch might be the one that brings me back to Pokemon
3757080	3760760	games since I bought the blue version ages ago.
3760760	3764960	You know, and with all the Pokemon Go hype, you know, that brought a lot of people back
3764960	3767340	to the series that haven't played it in a long time.
3767340	3773120	And then, you know, just build on that now with the biggest system in America right now,
3773120	3775760	according to these sales numbers, getting Pokemon.
3775760	3776760	That's going to also be huge.
3776760	3777760	Well, yeah.
3777760	3781780	And especially if some of these, you know, console manufacturers like Microsoft and Sony
3781780	3786240	don't put out like a really strong lineup for the fourth quarter, like throughout the
3786240	3787240	year.
3787240	3790640	I mean, granted, Sony does have a lot of things in the pipe, it's just when is that going
3790640	3791520	to hit?
3791520	3795520	And same with Microsoft though, Microsoft has a lot of stuff I know is out there, but
3795520	3797840	like, I don't know when the hell any of that's coming out.
3797840	3803680	Well, and again, that's why I'm really curious about is Microsoft potentially going to, or
3803680	3807800	anybody, I mean, this could be Sony too, going to try to see what's going on here with Nintendo
3807800	3812080	and they're just going to straight up, Jack, sorry guys, setting up something for the next
3812080	3818960	story, is are they just going to straight up like Jack the idea?
3818960	3822780	I think it's too early to straight up Jack the idea right now.
3822780	3825320	And I don't think that they're going to do another Vito.
3825320	3831400	I would like to see a portable console from one of them, but what would it do?
3831400	3836720	I mean, when it comes to Sony, I think in a way they've lost my trust a little bit with
3836720	3840900	portable consoles because they put them out and then they didn't support them.
3840900	3846040	So I would really want to hear some type of commitment from Sony that they have a four
3846040	3849360	year plan, a five year plan with their next portable.
3849360	3852720	But the weird thing is I say all that yet I'm thinking in the back of my mind, but Japan,
3852720	3854020	it's still thriving.
3854020	3856900	So it's one of those things where it's like, if I'm going to trust Sony with another portable
3856900	3861120	console, I want the commitment that they're going to stick with it and not abandon ship
3861120	3864120	after two years.
3864120	3867120	But I also understand that sales drive everything.
3867120	3868840	Even Nintendo probably had to abandon.
3868840	3869840	I want it to be awesome.
3869840	3872820	And I don't want them to do stupid experimental shit.
3872820	3875500	Like let's put a touch panel on the back of the fucking thing.
3875500	3876500	Why?
3876500	3877500	Why did you do that?
3877500	3878500	That's dumb.
3878500	3881140	All right, so we're going to move on here.
3881140	3884300	Speaking of Nintendo, I have some Nintendo rumors.
3884300	3889860	Look, I know not all you guys are into the rumor chat, but the way we envision this show
3889860	3893980	is that we all are sitting at the dinner table after playing games at the arcade and there's
3893980	3897580	always going to be inevitably somebody at the dinner table that says, hey, did you hear
3897580	3900140	about that Nintendo is doing this?
3900140	3903980	So girl, hold your wig because I got some news for you.
3903980	3904980	Right.
3904980	3905980	That's right.
3905980	3906980	So let's get into a few rumors here.
3906980	3910500	Uh, and you would think I would think I should play Adele's like rumor has it or something.
3910500	3913060	It's like an intro to this, but I think that's a little too obvious.
3913060	3922620	So I'm going to go a little more deep cut here and they remember Lindsay Lohan when
3922620	3923620	she had a singing career.
3923620	3924620	There you go.
3924620	3926540	I remember when she was talented.
3926540	3927540	That's Bobby Black Wolf right there.
3927540	3929540	I'm sick of rumors starting.
3929540	3933980	This is the Bobby Black Wolf Anthem sung by Lindsay Lohan.
3933980	3938780	All right, let's get to some rumors that have come out this week about Nintendo.
3938780	3939780	Okay.
3939780	3940780	Here's the big one.
3940780	3946060	There's a YouTube that showed up out there that was showing the supposed 5.0 firmware
3946060	3948420	for the Nintendo switch.
3948420	3951340	And uh, the, the video has since been removed.
3951340	3956020	Uh, some folks, the evidence, I guess, whatever shows that this is fake, but it was floating
3956020	3957020	around Twitter.
3957020	3960060	However, one Twitter user made the case for why it's fake.
3960060	3964020	Big red end and a tweet says the system update lead is leak is fake.
3964020	3969240	The console has Mario Kart eight DX downloaded digitally, which takes up 6.8 gigs of space,
3969240	3973780	but only two gigs of system memory has taken up less than 3.2 gigs of the SD card storage
3973780	3979280	has taken up and only 0.9 gigabyte cloud of cloud storage is taken up.
3979280	3984220	So in other words, the storage numbers gave it away basically that the video was a fake.
3984220	3990620	I felt the video was a fan based on the merit of, I, I, it was really this for me.
3990620	3996940	Did you see where like Hulu, crunchy roll, YouTube or whatever was Twitch was all like
3996940	4000060	in one little folder or something like that?
4000060	4005420	I just think that design is not what Nintendo is going to go with.
4005420	4006660	I think it's as simple as that.
4006660	4009660	I don't think they're going to consolidate on 3DS though.
4009660	4010660	What's that?
4010660	4011660	Don't they have folders on 3DS?
4011660	4013660	They do, but they don't look like that.
4013660	4014980	They don't look at all like that.
4014980	4019980	And so I don't think the miniature icons thing doesn't work for me.
4019980	4022240	That's not what Nintendo is going to do.
4022240	4026600	Even if they go to folders, they're not going to show miniaturized versions of game artwork
4026600	4030660	or things like that, because that would include Nintendo's own game artwork, which I think
4030660	4033300	they want to show in a different light.
4033300	4036100	That's really as simple as it is for me.
4036100	4038740	So there you go.
4038740	4041300	So everybody in here pretty much thinks that's a fake.
4041300	4047980	And even those in chat, I think, are like, nah, I mean, Nintendo may do something with
4047980	4052540	new firmware, but that's, you know, as sure as the sun is going to rise and fall every
4052540	4053540	day.
4053540	4058620	Anyway, let's talk about some other rumors and maybe these are more on the scale of,
4058620	4061580	well, maybe this could happen, but I'll see what you guys think of this.
4061580	4066020	Technically the sun stays stationary and the earth moves.
4066020	4068020	Thank you for that bit of science, Dark Soccer.
4068020	4069020	I appreciate it.
4069020	4070020	All right.
4070020	4071020	Fucking science.
4071820	4074420	Let's talk about Bayonetta 3 and Metroid Prime 4.
4074420	4076180	Well, we know those games are coming.
4076180	4081340	Nintendo's confirmed them both, but apparently Nintendo Norway's site says that these games
4081340	4086100	are for this year, both Metroid Prime 4 and Bayonetta 3.
4086100	4089420	That is a little bit more surprising, I think, in the Bayonetta 3 department, because we
4089420	4092140	just found out that that exists.
4092140	4093300	So what do you guys think?
4093300	4095540	Bayonetta 3, could it actually happen this year?
4095540	4096540	It's a placeholder.
4096540	4097540	Yeah.
4097540	4098540	You think it's more a placeholder?
4098540	4099540	I think it's all placeholder.
4099540	4100540	Apparently it's from Nintendo's site.
4101060	4105220	Bayonetta 3, Metroid Prime 4, and Kirby Star Alleys, as well as many other games that we
4105220	4106780	will reveal during the year.
4106780	4109420	We're looking forward to 2018, ba-da-ba-da-ba.
4109420	4110420	It's all placeholder.
4110420	4111420	We'll see.
4111420	4112420	I think it could happen, though.
4112420	4115260	I don't see why Metroid Prime 4 isn't something for this year.
4115260	4116980	We have an entire year.
4116980	4117980	It could happen.
4117980	4118980	Yeah, that's true.
4118980	4119980	All right.
4119980	4122140	Uh, moving on.
4122140	4124700	One more thing, and this, oh, darn it.
4124700	4125700	That was the same story.
4125700	4126700	Uh-oh, that's bad.
4126700	4129180	Did I put the same link twice in there?
4129180	4130180	You must have.
4130820	4131820	Son of a gun.
4131820	4134980	All right, well, there was another one in there.
4134980	4136800	Does anybody remember what the other Nintendo rumors were?
4136800	4138100	Let's see if I can find it here real quick.
4138100	4139100	I have one.
4139100	4144780	Um, I'm quickly trying to find it here about, uh, oh, shucks.
4144780	4145780	Oh, well.
4145780	4146780	Go ahead, DarkSakura.
4146780	4148780	What do you have for us?
4148780	4155380	Well, there, um, is a, uh, a discussion that was set up, um, trying to actually find where
4155380	4160060	the location was, um, that, um, there's, oh.
4160060	4168420	The site is, uh, Ruisatera, and there is someone named John Harker, who, um, has had some pretty
4168420	4175400	accurate predictions, um, came in with saying that there is a Nintendo Direct scheduled
4175400	4183620	for the 11th, um, and that, um, they don't know, he doesn't know if the timing has changed,
4183620	4193340	but, um, it also was, uh, confirmed by another poster named Emily, who said that SNK has
4193340	4201340	a Switch title also in development, and there was a discussion about these 18 Nintendo Switch
4201340	4205340	titles that popped up on Amazon yesterday.
4205340	4206660	Here's the thing, though.
4206660	4209020	Nintendo's going to do a Direct eventually.
4209020	4213300	That's how they put out their news, and we only know the news through, what, like, March
4213300	4214300	or April.
4214300	4217260	They've still got to date that Kirby game, which we know is going to be summer and stuff,
4217260	4220980	so they're going to do a Direct, but don't hold them to the 11th, and even, even in this
4220980	4224460	whole thing, what, the guy said the 11th, but the timing may have changed.
4224460	4227260	I mean, that's, that's a...
4227260	4231620	And an EA employee leaked something about there being a Direct this month, too.
4231620	4234580	I'm sure there'll be a Direct this month, but just don't be disappointed if it's not
4234580	4235580	the 11th.
4235580	4240900	Yeah, so the thing, though, about the Mystery games is that if you type in, in parentheses,
4240900	4246460	Switch title, not parentheses, but in quotes, Switch title in Amazon search, it comes up
4246460	4252340	with Switch title 23, Switch title 24, with no name, and with price points on them.
4252340	4253340	One of them listed is $99.
4253340	4254340	It's probably a collector's...
4254340	4255340	That's all place holder.
4255340	4257740	It could be a collector's edition of something, too.
4257740	4260460	Yeah, but that means that we're probably getting some announcements soon.
4260460	4261460	I'm sure.
4261460	4262460	Yeah.
4262460	4265660	Maybe the $99 for the Kirby thing, and there's, like, a cute little plushy Kirby that comes
4265660	4269060	with it, and you know Act Deft is already going to Amazon now to put in the pre-order.
4269060	4270060	Maybe.
4270620	4271620	All right.
4271620	4275900	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Act Deft points out they always do a Direct
4275900	4276900	in January.
4276900	4282580	Yeah, but the cycle's a little off, because the Switch, I mean, that was a Direct, but
4282580	4283580	it also wasn't.
4283580	4285200	It was actually a press conference in Japan.
4285200	4286700	They kind of did it direct style.
4286700	4287700	Remember that?
4287700	4290420	Because they had the people on stage doing that little snapping thing that was really
4290420	4291420	cute.
4291420	4293700	So they did that in January.
4293700	4298640	But I mean, again, this whole fact that Nintendo is just up and done, whatever the fuck they
4298640	4305440	feel like doing, they put out a console in March, and a lot of people at that time thought,
4305440	4309240	well, that's weird that they're doing it outside the holiday period, but they did that with
4309240	4310240	the 3DS too.
4310240	4311940	They seem to be doing okay.
4311940	4316560	So anyway, I found the other rumor thing that I was going to bring up, and this is actually
4316560	4321540	kind of a, I think it's a big one, it has to do with Konami, which, you know, we used
4321540	4326400	to love a lot, and then they've fallen out of favor, and now they're probably trying
4326400	4329000	to come back and possibly through retro stuff.
4329000	4332920	We know the Bomberman game probably did better than expected, and Konami, you know, for better
4332920	4336360	or for worse, has been supporting that pretty well with follow-up content.
4336360	4344640	Well, apparently, some of the WiiWare Rebirth games are looking to come back on the Switch.
4344640	4349400	That was Gradius Rebirth, Castlevania the Adventure Rebirth, and Contra Rebirth.
4349400	4350800	Did you ever check these out on the Wii?
4350800	4352360	I played the Castlevania one.
4352360	4355980	It was basically the Game Boy game, but then they kind of redid it in a Super Nintendo
4355980	4357280	style and put it on the Wii.
4357280	4360000	It sounds familiar, but I don't think I ever played them.
4360000	4361760	And I don't think a lot of people did.
4361760	4365800	You know, the WiiWare games kind of got flooded a little bit, and I'm not sure if everybody
4365800	4370640	kind of knew this was out there, so it wouldn't surprise me if they get a second chance, and
4370640	4378040	this is again one of those things where it's like, Konami could do this kinda easily, but
4378040	4379080	I don't know.
4379080	4382440	But anyway, we'll see what happens with that.
4382440	4388160	So, I mean, again, that's just somebody on, and I don't know what criteria this guy even
4388160	4392200	has rather than saying it's Konami rumor or whatever, but it would be kind of neat if
4392200	4393200	that did happen.
4393200	4394200	Yeah.
4394200	4398000	I think we'd like to see Konami, you know, again, Konami's one of those companies where
4398000	4402040	it's like, I do, I wanna root for them, but I wanna root for the old Konami, so maybe
4402040	4405520	I wanna see Konami kinda go back to their roots and do a lot of the stuff that works
4405520	4408000	for them and make some changes in how they run their business.
4408000	4409000	Yes.
4409000	4413200	So, I mean, you know, I think that's about the nicest way I can put it.
4413200	4419400	So all right, anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, uh, Konami?
4419400	4420400	Never heard of them.
4420400	4421400	I saw their name on a slot machine.
4421400	4422400	Yes.
4422400	4423400	Yes.
4423400	4425760	Well, you know, that business will still, uh, will still do very well for them.
4425760	4426760	All right.
4426760	4427760	Loki, what do we have next?
4427760	4428760	All right.
4428760	4434320	So kind of, um, going into the whole CES thing, um, which is gonna be actually starting I
4434320	4435320	think this week.
4435320	4439760	CES, they're gonna be showing off, or at least teasing, that there's gonna be a new
4439760	4446200	Vive shown off, um, that a second generation Vive with a higher resolution screen is gonna
4446200	4447760	be something that you might see there.
4447760	4453280	In fact, they have a little tease on Twitter saying, New Years, and it's all blurry, resolution,
4453280	4457720	and then 1-8-18, and, um, yeah.
4457720	4462560	So I guess we'll see tomorrow that there's gonna be a new Vive or something.
4462800	4469560	Well, I mean, you know, if they do new phones every year, why not upgrade the tech in the
4469560	4470560	VR every year?
4470560	4471560	It makes sense.
4471560	4472560	I'm waiting.
4472560	4475880	I'm on the fence waiting for, I hope that the price is right, because I think the Vive's
4475880	4478320	pretty expensive right now, but the tech's nice.
4478320	4481580	Well, usually when new tech comes out, old tech gets cheaper.
4481580	4485600	So would you maybe jump in on the old tech, knowing it would drop the price?
4485600	4489400	I do want to jump in on something maybe this year.
4489400	4493360	I have to see, like, the setup with the Vive and the whole room scale stuff is pretty large.
4493360	4496920	I know that's, I think, a little bit more optional, but, like, I don't know.
4496920	4501760	The Vive is, I mean, the reason why you have all that setup is that the accuracy is much
4501760	4503520	better on the Vive than probably anything else.
4503520	4504520	Yeah, I'm down with that.
4504520	4508800	It's just, you know, yeah, it'd be kind of crazy to set that up in my living room.
4508800	4510960	Yeah, you're just like, what the fuck are you doing?
4510960	4511960	You're kids might take you to the...
4511960	4512960	You're trying to watch TV.
4512960	4513960	Why are you walking in front of the TV?
4513960	4514960	That's true.
4514960	4517440	I would have a problem with that here, too, because Mr. Smoosh would probably try to climb
4517440	4518440	one of the poles.
4518480	4521160	He's like punching people in the game and he's like, what are you doing?
4521160	4522160	Can I play that?
4522160	4525480	I'm like, you better step back because I don't want to hit you.
4525480	4527360	Bobby Blackwolf making a new offer in chat.
4527360	4530720	I'll sell Loki my old Vive if they have a new Vive.
4530720	4533720	But I want the new Vive.
4533720	4535160	There's a way to do it.
4535160	4537000	That happens with phones sometimes, too.
4537000	4539520	I'm getting the new one, so I'm selling my old one.
4539520	4540520	Yeah.
4540520	4541520	Yeah, there you go.
4541520	4543560	All right.
4543560	4547360	Let me talk about some New Year's messages from some of your favorite gaming companies,
4547360	4554680	including Squeenix, Yosuke Matsuda talked in a message here, posted a letter this week
4554680	4559360	that talked about, you know, I want to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and the content
4559360	4564360	industry is going through all these different changes, including VR, AR, MR, and so forth.
4564360	4569340	So they mentioned in here, specifically, he's calling out VR, AR, and MR, and what's interesting
4569340	4572720	is that he actually brings up the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games because those games
4572720	4575040	are happening, of course, in Tokyo this year.
4575040	4581280	So Japan is trying to ramp up 5G infrastructure, so meaning there are more mobile networks
4581280	4585740	that provide constant connectivity and support massive data traffic at a low cost.
4585740	4589580	So kind of saying like, you know, what could this do for mobile gaming?
4589580	4594120	These technological advancements could result in new forums for creating content and new
4594120	4595120	business opportunities.
4595120	4600800	And then he goes into talking about a richer lineup of digital content platforms, mentioning
4600800	4604920	again smartphone shipments are in excess of 1.5 billion units.
4604920	4609880	He mentions the Nintendo Switch, which he called a major global success, selling more
4609880	4614720	than 10 million units worldwide, but then also called out the PlayStation 4 for selling
4614720	4619560	70 million units, and then the Xbox One for adding the Xbox One to its lineup, and then
4619560	4622360	didn't say anything about sales.
4622360	4624720	I can't help but notice those things.
4624720	4628280	I'm not trying to be rude to the Microsoft fans, it's just a little funny.
4628280	4629280	All right.
4629280	4632520	Anyway, so saying, you know, but he did say got off to a good start during the holiday
4632520	4633520	season.
4633520	4636920	So there's nothing else, you know, Square Enix still recognizes that and seems to be
4636920	4642000	committed to those platforms, even if not necessarily in Japan.
4642000	4645600	So while the consumer console game market has been solid in the West, it's struggling
4645600	4650700	in Japan, but we expect the Japanese market to gain significant vitality as it joins the
4650700	4652260	overall trend.
4652260	4656440	So kind of interesting, you know, he's just talking about that it's been good in 2018,
4656440	4660680	we're going to leverage the global acceleration of technological evolution as well as prevailing
4660680	4665320	market trends in order to provide high quality, high creative contents, so that we can bring
4665320	4669880	new amazement and fun to our customers the world over again, that's Yusuke Matsuda from
4669880	4671240	Square Enix.
4671240	4674200	So what do you guys think here and all that I mean, Square Enix really seems like they
4674200	4677320	still they're gonna have their fingers in every pot.
4677320	4682200	They're gonna do mobile, they're doing the switch, you can still expect Xbox Ones and
4682200	4684440	PS4, you know, stuff.
4684440	4685440	Same same.
4685440	4687160	It sounds like Square's kind of committed to everything.
4687160	4688760	Well, I'm excited about AR stuff.
4688760	4692840	I mean, that's why I got the the Pixel 2 because that was one of the phones that does support
4692840	4697120	some of that AR stuff, not that's a non-Apple phone.
4697120	4702280	But I'm still waiting for something that's other than these AR stickers, which it's all
4702280	4703280	right.
4703280	4705880	It's just kind of still lame, so early.
4705880	4709120	Well, on to a different 2018 message.
4709120	4714280	This one was from Natsume, of course, the makers of Harvest Moon, which is adorable
4714280	4715280	little series.
4715280	4719720	This was a letter from Hiro Mikawa, who's the president and CEO of Natsume.
4719720	4723000	And of course, it did focus on Harvest Moon because that's that company's kind of bread
4723000	4724000	and butter.
4724000	4727500	He starts by sharing a little bit of, you know, his memories with Harvest Moon, but
4727500	4731360	also pointing out that, you know, in celebration of Harvest Moon's 20th anniversary, we've
4731360	4734820	developed a new Harvest Moon title, Harvest Moon Light of Hope.
4734820	4740560	It's the first Harvest Moon to be multi-platform PC, Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation 4.
4740560	4744820	The PC version was released in November, and the Switch and the PS4 are going to be released
4744820	4745820	early this year.
4745820	4749480	Then you just kind of continue to say thank you for the continued support.
4749480	4753680	We have several other exciting titles coming this year, in addition to Harvest Moon Light
4753680	4756980	of Hope for Switch and PS4, so stay tuned.
4756980	4761140	And they are committed to, quote, make everyone happy.
4761140	4762880	That's their corporate mission.
4762880	4764980	Don't you just want to hug them?
4764980	4766820	Natsume always had some of the cutest boosts at E3.
4766820	4769020	That was the big inflatable cute cows and stuff.
4769020	4772820	So you can't help but just pinch their little cheeks and go, you're so damn adorable.
4772820	4773820	All right.
4773820	4776580	Are you going to play some new Harvest Moon, Dark Sakura?
4776580	4778760	I'm surprised that's a series you don't play anymore.
4778760	4779760	I didn't like it.
4779760	4780760	That was never my thing.
4780760	4781760	Really?
4781760	4783760	It was always, you know, whose thing.
4783760	4786220	OK, fair enough.
4786220	4787220	Let's see.
4787220	4790220	287 in chat says, Natsume for the win.
4790220	4792380	Fifth Dream in chat says Harvest Valley.
4792380	4793380	All right.
4793380	4795660	You going to check out Harvest Moon?
4795660	4796900	I'm going to check it out on Switch.
4796900	4797900	It might be cute.
4797900	4799620	I want to see what it looks like.
4799620	4803580	I still haven't played the other farming game.
4803580	4804580	So many farming games.
4804580	4805580	There's a lot of farming.
4805580	4807820	It's Farmville Simulator and Farming Simulator.
4807820	4808820	Yes.
4808820	4814820	I need a cross between like Farming Simulator and like with the romance options of Mass
4814820	4817660	Effect or any BioWare game.
4817660	4819420	I think we need to do that.
4819420	4821300	Call it barn life.
4821300	4822300	I'm down with that.
4822300	4823300	That's fine.
4823300	4827220	You actually did have that in World of Warcraft in a quest.
4827220	4828220	I do remember that.
4828220	4831820	Well, they kind of and they really expanded on that in later expansions when you have
4831820	4835380	like the garrison and now they kind of you don't really have the garrison anymore.
4835380	4840180	The Mr. Garrison, you have the allies that you send out.
4840180	4844380	It's kind of a similar thing, but it always makes me laugh to go back because that's always
4844380	4849580	why I want to do my level there for Alliance is because I love that whole stupid quest
4849580	4850580	line.
4850580	4851580	I understand.
4851580	4855260	I took a great picture of Mr. Smoosh, by the way, which wow is going to be changing pretty
4855260	4858540	significantly in the coming weeks whenever that patch rolls out because the leveling
4858540	4860900	is going to change completely.
4860900	4866140	You will be able to level one to 60 in any zone in the old world because the level scaling
4866140	4869460	that they do, you know how the level scaling in Legion, you can kind of go from a hundred
4869460	4872000	to 110, like kind of however you want.
4872000	4873500	They're doing that with old content.
4873500	4880460	And then what's going to happen is 70 to 90, no, sorry, 60 to 80 is going to be, you can
4880460	4884620	go to Northrend or you can go to Outland, pick which one you like more and stay there.
4885380	4886940	I think that's when I'm going to re up.
4886940	4887940	Yeah.
4887940	4888940	And a lot of people are looking at that.
4888940	4893780	Either that or I might just go ahead and do it while I'm recovering so I can get my, because
4893780	4899940	I was already, I had just finished the Gul'dan raid, so it shouldn't take me too long to
4899940	4900940	catch up.
4900940	4902940	Well, let's move on.
4902940	4903940	You have a new story for us.
4903940	4904940	It has nothing to do with wow.
4904940	4908900	It has everything to do with Kylo Ren's abs.
4908900	4914580	So there's already a mod for Star Wars Battlefront II that lets you play as Matt, the radar technician.
4915540	4921140	Which if you don't know, Saturday Night Live did this thing where it was like the Undercover
4921140	4927300	Bosses show or whatever it was, where he went incognito, where Kylo Ren went as Matt, the
4927300	4932820	radar technician to see what the employees on the Starkiller base thought of him.
4932820	4937100	And then, you know, he came out as, you know, oh, it's me.
4937100	4938500	Oh, we knew it was you the whole time.
4938500	4939940	Oh, great, whatever.
4939940	4946460	So, but he had like these old like 80s style, you know, glasses and, you know, a bad blonde
4946460	4947460	wig.
4947460	4952140	So he is in Star Wars Battlefront II as a mod.
4952140	4958020	So yeah, don't force choke employees in the break room.
4958020	4961180	And also, if you haven't seen that sketch, watch it because it's fucking hilarious.
4961180	4962180	Okay.
4962180	4963180	It is great.
4963180	4966940	It was, Saturday Night Live is getting a little bit of its groove back.
4966940	4967940	A little bit.
4967940	4973060	It's still as good as it was in the 90s or the 70s, but it's, you know, it's getting
4973060	4974060	its groove back.
4974060	4978740	It's not as bad as it was either because it was pretty bad there for a while.
4978740	4981380	But that whole skit is amazing.
4981380	4982860	It is pretty great.
4982860	4983940	All right.
4983940	4986700	So let's move on with Logie.
4986700	4988220	All right.
4988220	4994220	So you know, that game that everybody's into nowadays, that Star Wars Battlefront II, it's
4994220	4996460	being updated quite a bit.
4996780	4998060	Oh, I'm sorry.
4998060	5000540	Not the Star Wars Battlefront II that's out now.
5000540	5002660	But from 2005, actually.
5002660	5010500	So the 2005 version, which is probably, I wouldn't say a better version, but the better
5010500	5013180	version is being continually updated.
5013180	5016500	There's actually a lot of people playing it still, and they've been doing some different
5016500	5022060	patching optimizations, including improving the lobby functionality, adding Steam usernames
5022060	5024620	that show up correctly now when you're playing.
5024620	5028060	And then they had more accurate ping calculations, stuff like that.
5028060	5032780	So if you're sick of Battlefront II and you want to play some better Battlefront II, you
5032780	5035980	can do that because they have it available.
5035980	5038260	The classic version, I think on Steam.
5038260	5044100	Yeah, I think they do sell the old one on Steam.
5044100	5045100	They do.
5045100	5051020	So, you know, definitely worth checking out if you don't have it.
5051060	5052740	And even if you do have it, you should just check it out.
5052740	5053740	Ten dollars.
5053740	5062100	Ten dollars for the non loot box filled garbage Battlefront II game.
5062100	5065020	Can I do a quick aside real quick that's not related to gaming that's going to disgust
5065020	5067460	all of you?
5067460	5073220	So Alan and I celebrated eight years of dating this past week because we started dating January
5073220	5074220	4th of 2010.
5074220	5077380	I just want to point out, no, and it is related to what's going on right now because he just
5077380	5079820	got back from his other Sunday night stuff he does.
5079820	5081620	And he just brought me a Starbucks.
5081620	5083100	Didn't even ask.
5083100	5086900	And he knew that I'd already had a coffee before the show because he said, it's hot
5086900	5087900	cocoa.
5087900	5089540	It's not coffee.
5089540	5090540	What a guy.
5090540	5094820	So I just have to, I just have to do a little wah moment.
5094820	5096820	He just yelled from the living room, barf.
5096820	5100980	Listen, this isn't River City Ransom.
5100980	5101980	But it should be.
5101980	5104060	River City Ransom is awesome.
5104060	5105060	Oh my God.
5105060	5107500	I'm just looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5107500	5112340	I think the Ingress takeover is beginning because I see a Zet and Rockat are both in
5112340	5114380	our chat right now chatting.
5114380	5115380	That's awesome.
5115380	5116380	Sup guys.
5116380	5121380	Well, I think the only person I've spoken with is Rockat other than just seeing people
5121380	5124740	in our group discussion.
5124740	5129180	For those who don't know on Ingress, I go as Kurotsubasa, which is always the nickname
5129180	5132060	I use when dark Sakura is not available.
5132060	5133060	Fair enough.
5133060	5134060	Yeah.
5134060	5135060	Hot cocoa is good.
5135060	5136060	All right.
5136060	5139380	So we're going to move on to one more story before we get to the classic game of the week.
5139380	5143020	But this kind of has to do with classic games a little bit.
5143020	5146820	This has to do with a new game and it's a shooter game.
5146820	5151980	Dark Sakura, you might be into this, a top-down shooter and it's a Sega Sega, but it's going
5151980	5154820	to be on the mega drive, the Genesis and the Dreamcast.
5154820	5157100	It is called Xeno crisis.
5157100	5163180	They're trying to recreate the look and feel of classic Sega games to do this new.
5163180	5166620	It's going to be new Sega Genesis cartridge and CD based releases.
5166620	5170600	So Xena crisis, it's going to be a procedurally generated labyrinth.
5170600	5171900	That means a roguelike.
5171900	5172900	That's okay.
5172900	5173900	Uh, of alien.
5173900	5175540	It looks like, it looks like alien syndrome.
5175540	5176540	Holy shit.
5176540	5178740	Like, doesn't it just look like alien syndrome?
5178740	5179940	Alien syndrome.
5179940	5183780	It does to me a bit, except it doesn't have the big blobby things everywhere.
5183780	5190140	Cause that was always what defined alien syndrome to me, but dude, this fuck me, I need this.
5190140	5193980	Well, you can go to Kickstarter because that's where it is right now.
5193980	5198660	They are looking at putting out the ROMs and cartridges in October, 2018 to try to be right
5198660	5202420	alongside the 30th anniversary of the mega drives launch in Japan.
5202420	5204660	You can check that out by searching Xeno crisis.
5204660	5208260	That's Xena crisis, uh, over on yield Kickstarter.
5208260	5209260	Good luck to those guys.
5209260	5213260	10, 10 pounds for a 15 pounds for a downloadable ROM file.
5213260	5215380	Yeah, not bad, right?
5215380	5216380	Not bad at all.
5216380	5219900	It's interesting that they're embracing that route too, where it's like Dreamcast
5219900	5220900	file.
5220900	5222780	Oh, so you can burn your own disc.
5222780	5223780	Why not?
5223780	5224780	Yeah.
5224780	5225780	Yeah.
5225780	5233460	25 pounds gets you, um, the mega drive ROM, the Dreamcast file and the OST might have
5233460	5234460	to get in on that.
5234460	5238460	But one of them says this is a switch download as well.
5238460	5239460	All right.
5239460	5240460	Anyway.
5240460	5241460	Sorry to distract you, Jamie.
5241460	5246100	We got to get to the classic game of the week, not halo talk about that earlier.
5246100	5248580	That'll be later if you got, if y'all make it.
5248580	5251860	But this week, dark soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that
5251860	5259540	she thinks, Hey, you brats put down your new fangled breath of the wilds, your Mario odysseys
5259540	5265980	and your, your pub G's or pug bees, whatever that thing is and play this game instead.
5265980	5266980	Yeah.
5266980	5267980	Classic game of the week.
5267980	5268980	Dark soccer.
5268980	5270740	What is the classic game of the week this week?
5270740	5278220	Ray storm, which is a scrolling shooter, uh, that was developed by Taito.
5278220	5284620	Um, it only came out in Japan and arcades in 1996 and later on there was a PlayStation
5284620	5291260	port in 97 and the Sega Saturn version that came out as layer section two.
5291260	5297940	Um, there were other releases of it that came, um, including versions and combinations, but
5297940	5304460	I'll get to that in a moment because Ray storm is probably one of my favorite, I would
5304460	5305460	say shooters.
5305460	5310660	And on top of that, it was one of the babies that working designs released.
5310660	5311660	There's no menu music.
5311660	5312660	I need to fast forward here.
5312660	5315620	Well, I think I put a timestamp in my original link.
5315620	5317020	Sue me.
5317020	5319580	There we go.
5319580	5320580	Okay.
5320740	5329740	So, um, and it is in the whole series that was, um, uh, Ray force, Ray crisis, you know,
5329740	5333500	all of those, um, all of those Ray games.
5333500	5342020	Um, and, um, so it actually is the big thing that sets this apart from the other ones is
5342020	5349860	that the big thing of this is it started off, um, using, uh, polygon ships instead of sprites.
5349860	5356460	And, um, you basically have, um, different modes that you can play through.
5356460	5362420	It actually has, uh, a few things with the PlayStation versions that made it similar
5362420	5364300	to Xevious 3D.
5364300	5370500	Um, but it all is pretty much that, that shooting, but it has another element to it.
5370500	5376340	Um, with the element as well, you have, um, a, you have your laser weapon as your primary
5376340	5379300	offense and a missile that locks onto targets.
5379300	5384740	So you move around the screen, locking it onto a target, and then you shoot missiles.
5384740	5389420	And then you have your special attack, where if you fill your bar to maximum, then you
5389420	5390420	get multiple lock-ons.
5390420	5395900	Um, you also have another one that's a hyper laser result that's basically like a, a charging
5395900	5396900	blast.
5396900	5399140	Um, you can play as two ships.
5399140	5406220	One's the Argray, one that has a single laser that spreads out, um, and you have your lock-on
5406220	5408420	and multiple missiles.
5408420	5413140	And then the Argray 2, which is twin lasers, um, with higher attack power, but it has less
5413140	5414140	range.
5414140	5417420	Um, and your lock-on is 16 targets.
5417420	5419740	Um, it has all kinds of different modes.
5419740	5423980	You have the arcade mode, you have your extra mode that has enhanced graphics and extra
5423980	5427940	enemies, different bosses, tougher difficulty, and a different ending.
5427940	5434300	Um, and in extra mode, you get a continue that lets you continue to add up your score.
5434300	5441020	There's another one that's called 13 players, which, um, if you, um, you have to complete
5441020	5446820	the game using a total of 13 ships from five groups, three Argray 1 ships using manual,
5446820	5452460	um, three using, uh, a different man- uh, three Argray 2 ships with manual control,
5452460	5456860	and then you have, um, the auto methods, basically you have to use every type of method, and
5456980	5462620	then the Argray Zero prototype ship that you, um, basically have to obtain for the game.
5462620	5468900	And you'll also get a fourth ship called the Argear that you will be able to play.
5468900	5476620	So, um, this game basically, I would probably say is one of, I'd say the best games that
5476620	5479060	came out in the PlayStation era.
5479060	5487220	So, um, it really was, number one, a challenging game, but also a pretty game with great music
5487220	5488220	as well.
5488220	5491820	It's a shooter game I remember, and that says something, but it's that style, it's that
5491820	5498060	the way the polygons are kind of like 3D-ish tilted down, like a kind of Zelda adventure
5498060	5502740	of Link style, but more with polygons than sprites, because, you know, it's got a great
5502740	5503740	look to it.
5503740	5509620	Well, at any rate, um, they had talked about there being, this actually went through kind
5509620	5513940	of an interesting development cycle for, um, actually it should be more with the North
5513940	5520460	American release of it, is that several companies were trying to get it released, but no one
5520460	5521820	came forward.
5521820	5529180	Working Designs was working with Taito to try to license Rayforce, but Acclaim stepped
5529180	5530820	in and did that.
5530820	5535700	So when Raystorm came out, they jumped right in on it, licensed it immediately, and met
5535700	5541580	with Taito to talk about the conversion for an American release.
5541580	5545780	It was their first release for the PlayStation by Working Designs, and it was released under
5545780	5550060	their Spaz label for shooter games.
5550060	5559540	It was also, um, the, uh, you know, listed as, you know, a full, you know, Ray game.
5559540	5562540	I use that quote fingers that no one could see.
5562540	5567340	And then a playable demo came out, one of those little interactive CD samplers.
5567340	5575580	So after Squeamix acquired Taito, it came on as a PlayStation Network game in Japan
5575580	5577420	in 2008.
5577420	5584580	And then, um, basically all the other ones came out eventually on PlayStation 3 and PSP.
5584580	5589060	And then there was the Raystorm HD that came out as a downloadable for PlayStation 3 and
5589060	5591860	Xbox 360 in 2010.
5591860	5598620	And we got it in the U.S. and Europe as well, I'm sorry North America and Europe, and, um,
5598620	5603180	the original game though played on a Sony ZN1 JAMA board.
5603180	5609260	So, um, there are hacked versions of it that will play on the Taito G-Net system, so there's
5609260	5610260	that too.
5610260	5616640	So as far as compilations that came out, there's Taito Memories Volume 2, which in Japan was
5616640	5620140	Taito Memories Gekkan that had a bunch of other Taito games.
5620140	5626540	There's Taito Legends 2 for PlayStation 2, G-Darius plus Raystorm pack, and, um, Simple
5626540	5632100	1500 Series Volume 7, the double shooting for PlayStation, which also included Ray Crisis.
5632620	5634060	I love the Simple series.
5634060	5636060	You do?
5636060	5637060	Yeah.
5637060	5643060	Because the Simple 2000 series is what brought us the Defense Force and the Chambara.
5643060	5644060	Okay.
5644060	5653780	Um, the other thing, um, is that working designs, as they've been known to do, um, revised the
5653780	5656700	difficulty in it.
5656700	5663020	They basically, um, made it a little bit tougher, I think, so if you can, if you set
5663020	5668500	the difficulty below 4, then it runs a training mode, but after 4, it's like the full version,
5668500	5675340	so basically, it's trying to encourage people to play it on higher difficulties, um, and
5675340	5681060	that they fixed an issue with the Japanese version where compatibility, um, with certain
5681060	5684620	game controllers, uh, there was some issues with compatibility.
5684860	5690540	Um, there's another version of Raystorm, uh, by Cyberfront that came out, um, for, uh,
5690540	5696380	DOS, um, that was, uh, based off of the PlayStation release, um, but it didn't have, like, all
5696380	5702580	of the arranged items, and then, um, the PlayStation 2 version of Taito Memories and Taito Legends
5702580	5706940	2 only has the arcade mode list, uh, in the series.
5706940	5716020	Um, so yeah, basically, um, the game itself, it was considered a little short, but it was,
5716020	5724020	you know, amazing to play, lots of fun, and of course, those, uh, difficulty, um, levels
5724020	5728460	would, you know, definitely encourage, you know, replay and an ongoing challenge, especially
5728460	5732860	when you're trying to unlock things and get extra, the extra ships and trying to get the
5732860	5734180	true ending.
5734180	5741380	Um, now, it did have quite the legacy, um, so Raycrisis did come out two years later,
5741380	5747260	and it had, um, the home versions actually had the Argue 1 and 2 as hidden ships from
5747260	5753880	this game, and then Taito, um, released, uh, Huda Huda Park that was a collection of minigames
5753880	5759740	that was inspired by their arcade games for the, uh, that was put out for the Wii, and
5759740	5768140	it had, um, uh, Raystorm minigames that were basically, uh, kind of bullet hell minigames,
5768140	5770140	so there you go.
5770140	5775140	Alright, classic game of the week, real classic shooter, Raystorm.
5775140	5777740	Raystorm, what a great game.
5777740	5782500	And don't worry, guys, I will eventually do some of the Thunder Force games, a couple
5782500	5784140	of people have asked me privately.
5784140	5789020	You know, you've done now, you're coming up on 500 classic games of the week, I mean,
5789020	5792020	I've helped, Loki's helped, some of our guests have helped in the weeks you haven't been
5792020	5795220	here, but you're coming up on almost 500 classic games in the archive, can you believe that?
5795220	5799020	But remember, y'all, if you want Halo, 300 more dollars.
5799020	5803820	Alright, um, well, we're gonna take a break, and when we come back, we have plenty more
5803820	5807220	show to come, including rapid fire news, we're gonna do some release dates, and take your
5807220	5811620	calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, that is all coming up after we take a quick break,
5811620	5815020	so don't go anywhere, we're gonna be right back with the conclusion of tonight's Orange
5815020	5815920	Lounge Radio.
5819020	5827820	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 713
5827820	5835420	in progress for this January the 7th of 2018, our first show of our 16th year of broadcasting,
5835420	5837620	if you can believe it, since 2002.
5837620	5838620	We're getting old.
5838620	5844020	Alright, you missed some of our 2018 predictions early on, as well as kind of looking back
5844020	5847020	at the messy notes we left ourself.
5847020	5851420	Somebody should've told us to clean up those notes earlier, oh well, we learned for next
5851420	5852420	time.
5852420	5855320	Let's get back into some gaming news, and we'll get to your calls a little later at
5855320	5859720	Orange Lounge Radio, I don't think we have emails tonight, I'm gonna have to have Dark
5859720	5863620	Soccer let me know in the mailbag, but we may get to calls a little sooner than that
5863620	5864620	because of that.
5864620	5866220	So, but let's do rapid fire news first, Loki.
5866220	5870220	Yeah, so let's talk about some games that have been translated into English.
5870220	5876020	And so one of these games, well, it's the latest Tingle game, that's right.
5876020	5883620	So Ripened Tingle's Balloon Trip of Love, which was released in 2009, has now had an
5883620	5886120	English patch created for its ROM.
5886120	5891820	So if you feel like playing that, you can now download the patch to play it in English.
5891820	5892820	Hooray.
5892820	5895620	I'm so happy that you are reporting this news to us.
5895620	5896620	Yes.
5896620	5901300	Another game that's also been translated in English now is Super Famicom Wars, is now
5901300	5904120	playable in English as well.
5904120	5909680	It came out, I guess, on the Game Boy Advance in Japan.
5909680	5913560	But yeah, that's pretty cool as well.
5913560	5920520	And of course, if you're not into translations, maybe you're into fan mods, in which case
5920520	5926420	you can play the newer Super Mario Brothers DS.
5926420	5932080	So they did a newer Super Mario Brothers game out on the Wii, but this is actually a mod
5932080	5933280	of the DS game.
5933280	5939600	It's a fan-made game, and you can actually only play it on the PC, because it doesn't
5939600	5943780	run in an actual ROM.
5943780	5949780	But yeah, it was made using the new Super Mario Brothers editor, apparently.
5949780	5955880	So there you have 80 levels, eight world maps, and they even had some changes to the graphics
5955880	5958880	and a new soundtrack.
5958880	5962420	So you can check that out as well online.
5962420	5965340	That's cool that they even went in and did the soundtrack.
5965340	5967540	Yeah, the music was different.
5967540	5973620	I didn't really play the new Super Mario Brothers on DS, or at least not enough to see half
5973620	5974620	this stuff.
5974620	5978620	So I'm not positive how much of this is all really new, but I see Mario in a minecart.
5978620	5980180	I don't remember if that was in the game.
5980180	5981740	Yeah, that's pretty neat.
5981740	5986380	All right, well, a little change in Pokemon Go, for those of you that are still playing
5986380	5987880	Pokemon Go.
5987880	5991500	It's a lot more of you than people tend to think, because I was at...
5991500	5996060	I didn't talk about this on the show, but I went to a nest here locally.
5996060	5998100	You know how Pokemons nest in certain areas?
5998100	6002180	So over in a not so great part of town is where the Wailmers are nesting.
6002180	6008340	And Wailmer is a Gen 3 whale Pokemon, and like Magikarp, it takes 400 candies to evolve
6008340	6009340	one.
6009340	6010940	So you have to catch a lot of Wailmers, right?
6010940	6015180	So I was actually at a farm, and there was a lot of people walking around that park and
6015180	6017740	all staring at their phones, playing Pokemon Go.
6017740	6019500	So it's still a thing.
6019500	6024140	So I know there's some people that were a little sad to hear that, yes, there are more
6024140	6027380	Pokemon that are being region exclusived.
6027380	6030420	But this time, something unique happened this past week.
6030420	6031780	They flipped.
6031780	6036300	So Zangoose and Seviper were region exclusives.
6036300	6040340	And that's probably because in the original anime and in the games, they had a little
6040340	6041340	bit of a feud.
6041340	6045100	Because I don't know if you guys know, but Mongooses and Mongoose snakes are kind of
6045100	6046100	like a rivalry.
6046100	6047660	Yes, I saw Ricky Tiki Tavi as well.
6047660	6048660	Yeah, there you go.
6049100	6050660	They have rivalry in the games as well.
6050660	6052560	So they stay far away from each other.
6052560	6059100	But unlike Kangaskhan and Taros and Mr. Mime, what happened is that Zangoose and Seviper
6059100	6060340	flipped.
6060340	6061500	So they flipped.
6061500	6064580	So now we can't catch Zangoose anymore.
6064580	6068540	Hopefully you got one while they were here, but you can get Seviper, which I still have
6068540	6071460	yet to see one, but I'm hoping I get to see either of those.
6071460	6074980	Well, the good news, there was a Zangoose on the house here not that long ago.
6074980	6078620	I'm lucky in that for some reason, like there's always like three Pokemon on top of the house.
6079580	6080580	Yeah.
6080580	6081580	Yeah.
6081580	6085060	So, uh, but something to keep in mind is that if they flip this, maybe they'll flip back.
6085060	6089660	But what I'm really hoping is that Plusle and Minosyn, I hope I said their names right,
6089660	6090860	but it's plus and minus.
6090860	6093420	Little Pikachu ripoffs, the battery Pikachus.
6093420	6095940	The battery Pikachus are also region exclusive.
6095940	6101340	So we have Plus and Asia and you know, everything on the other side of the ocean has a minus.
6101340	6103660	Remember when I run one plus use of those at E3?
6103660	6104660	Oh, I do.
6104660	6105660	They're so cute.
6105660	6106660	I need to get them back from Julie.
6106660	6107660	They are really cute.
6107700	6109660	Maybe those guys will flip too.
6109660	6110660	That would be very nice.
6110660	6115500	So, uh, JD in our chat says, I got two, it's been very cloudy.
6115500	6119220	So poison boost and act F correcting me on the names there.
6119220	6127740	Plusle and minion are the names there, um, over at live.vognetwork.com.
6127740	6133960	All right, let's move on to one other quick news, which has to do with the Miiverse archive.
6133960	6139120	The Miiverse archive or archive verse has, uh, been made live.
6139120	6140120	It's up.
6140120	6145600	Uh, you can dig through old Miiverse posts from the Wii U and the 3DS, apparently over
6145600	6153240	8 million user profiles, 133 million posts, 75 million screenshots, 72 million drawings,
6153240	6157360	almost 17 terabytes of data.
6157360	6160720	And what's really cool about this is one of the big guys behind this, it's doing this
6160720	6166640	drastic actions, uh, has listened to, uh, some of our podcasts in the past, at least
6166640	6167640	more Bobby Black Wolf.
6167640	6168640	I know.
6168640	6170440	And in fact, Bobby Black Wolf had him on a show.
6170440	6172840	Uh, I think it was the week I was in Seattle.
6172840	6173840	So it was in early November.
6173840	6177540	So if you want to hear more about the project, you can check out that episode of Bobby Black
6177540	6182640	Wolf show, but it is noteworthy that the project did go live this past week.
6182640	6184480	So a lot of people are checking it out.
6184480	6189960	So if you want to check out the, uh, archive, you can do that at Archie verse, A R C H I
6189960	6194680	V E R S E dot guide G U I D E.
6194680	6200360	There you go to register participation for this week's episode of orange laundry 80 with
6200360	6201880	vog network.com.
6201880	6207400	Use the passphrase B let's move on and our soccer.
6207400	6214160	You have a couple for us, a couple, um, it would help if they didn't like go off my screen.
6214160	6215160	There we go.
6215160	6219880	Um, so the IGN editor in chief was fired.
6219880	6224000	Um, basically it was over alleged misconduct.
6224000	6231940	Um, so basically, um, IGN, uh, put out the investigation regarding Steve Butts and as
6231940	6235760	a result, they have decided to part ways with him.
6235760	6242560	Um, this was a statement by Mitch Galbraith, who is the executive vice president.
6242560	6249400	Um, and the, uh, co-founder and chief content officer, Pierre Schneider will be taking over
6249400	6251560	as editor in chief on the interim.
6251560	6257640	Um, the update, um, basically says that Pierre Schneider will be taking over as long as it
6257640	6260160	takes to get everything right.
6260160	6266080	Um, so yeah, pretty, uh, crazy stuff.
6266080	6271240	Also noteworthy as, you know, IGN was in the news not that long ago for purchasing humble
6271240	6272240	bundle.
6272240	6277340	So this, you know, transition, which, you know, if the allegations are true by sounds
6277340	6280320	like 2017 is continuing to take out the garbage.
6280320	6282520	Um, but, uh, definitely garbage.
6282520	6288920	So anyway, but looking, looking to new year, new me, new society, um, hopefully, uh, the
6288920	6292640	humble bundle, you know, and all that stuff is going to be overseen by this new guy here.
6292640	6296840	Well, the other thing too, is that this basically stemmed from, I'm going to mispronounce her
6296840	6302120	last name, but it's Kelly plague, plague, P L A G G E.
6302120	6303680	Who is an editor at GameStop.
6303680	6306520	She went public, um, uh, for game spot.
6306520	6312240	Sorry, went public about her experiences working at IGN, that a senior staff targeted her and
6312240	6317260	another female editor with quote manipulative and abusive comments.
6317260	6321080	And it was also terribly mishandled by HR.
6321080	6324880	And that's why she left because she didn't feel safe at her job.
6324880	6329440	So I know a lot of talk in the golden globes going on tonight has to do with everything
6329440	6332840	that we heard about with the, the garbage dumping in the film industry this past year.
6332840	6338100	So just a unfortunate reminder that it wasn't just the movie industry that was affected
6338100	6345720	by this, but you know, to try to turn, you know, something that's horrible into something
6345720	6349240	better, you know, at least this shift in our society.
6349240	6353400	Hopefully a lot of us are kind of reflecting going, you know, I'm going to make it my resolution
6353400	6357600	or whatever you want to call it to not be shitty to people.
6357600	6366480	You know what, and it's, it's a little bit of a quote, but if, and this especially goes,
6366480	6373680	if you are teaching your daughters to be careful around men, then teach your sons what consent
6373680	6376220	is.
6376220	6379160	You know, it's fucking stupid.
6379160	6383000	Don't pass on this whole toxic masculinity thing.
6383000	6386200	Teach your, teach your kids to not be shit hole garbage.
6386200	6387200	Yeah.
6387800	6388800	Let's end it.
6388800	6392240	You know, if the, if the millennials really want to stick it to the boomers for all the
6392240	6398200	bullshit avocado toast articles, be the generation that ends this shit.
6398200	6399200	Do it.
6399200	6400200	Do it.
6400200	6403560	You can, you can start right now by teaching your kids to stand up for what they believe
6403560	6405940	no matter how bullied or picked on they are.
6405940	6409440	As borderline shillenials or whatever they call that.
6409440	6410440	It's zenial.
6410440	6411440	Zenial.
6411440	6415480	And I think I am just at the edge of Gen X.
6415480	6416480	Yeah.
6416760	6417760	You know, whatever.
6417760	6418760	Well anyway.
6418760	6420600	We were the, we were the awesome ones cause we had grunge.
6420600	6422600	And Radiohead.
6422600	6433960	Anyway, so another good, this is some good news, is that basically the, the developer
6433960	6441480	at Capcom who is behind Rival Schools and Capcom versus SNK and Devil May Cry, Itsu
6441480	6449000	no Hideaki, basically has come out and said that they are working on a new game under
6449000	6450000	Climax.
6450000	6454040	In fact, I'll just read the quote, happy new, and it's in English by the way, um, happy
6454040	6455040	new year.
6455040	6458720	I am sorry that I cannot present a new project last year.
6458720	6462320	The development of the project is now under Climax.
6462320	6464080	I am making a great game.
6464080	6465880	So please expect it.
6465880	6470080	It does kind of sound like you ran it through Google translate.
6470080	6471080	A little bit.
6471080	6475760	Well, honestly enough, usually if I can't figure out how to say something right in Japanese,
6475760	6478680	it comes out sounding like it came through Google translate as well.
6478680	6485600	So, um, but, uh, we're hoping that it's a fighting game.
6485600	6488600	I would really, really like another Rival Schools.
6488600	6492360	Um, cause I mean, that's serious, your expectations.
6492360	6496320	So you're not mad if it isn't, but well, the gaming industry, I already predicted I would
6496320	6498320	be disappointed the entire year.
6498320	6500120	So that's true.
6500160	6501920	We'll see how that stays out.
6501920	6506560	Um, but if God, if we have another Rival Schools, that'd make me happy.
6506560	6507560	Of course.
6507560	6508560	I'm also, you're not alone in that.
6508560	6510960	You know, I didn't put it in the time capsule.
6510960	6514960	I should have put the one game I'm looking forward to, which is a Dragon Ball Fighter
6514960	6515960	Z.
6515960	6518320	Oh, there that's not that long that you have to wait for that.
6518320	6519320	No, not at all.
6519320	6524840	That's going to be mine, especially since I'm, God, I hate this current art.
6524840	6528560	You didn't, you didn't put that on your games that you were anticipating to be good.
6528560	6531000	I didn't, I didn't make a list of games I anticipated to be good.
6531000	6532000	Oh, I thought you did.
6532000	6535520	No, I could just go write it down real quick and put it in there.
6535520	6537160	Do it when I'm not looking.
6537160	6538160	It's sealed.
6538160	6539160	Okay.
6539160	6540160	All right.
6540160	6543400	But, um, but, uh, I'm kind of disappointed with the current story arc in Dragon Ball
6543400	6551040	Super cause I, it's more of the endless stream of bullshit filler, but I do like a lot of
6551040	6553920	the characters that are in it and finding out that some of these characters are going
6553920	6554920	to be in the game.
6554920	6557400	It makes me really happy.
6557440	6560460	You know, what's weird since you brought up anime, you know, I've been talking a lot about
6560460	6564320	magfest all the way out in Washington DC, the other coast, right?
6564320	6568340	Yet here locally this weekend, we had a con that's actually getting bigger and bigger.
6568340	6572240	Like Rama was making posts about things that were happening out here at SAC anime.
6572240	6576840	I don't know if you guys, but, but yet none of us went for some reason.
6576840	6581240	I heard actually, uh, our buddy Shane went and I know was trying to meet one of the voice
6581240	6584960	actors from Danganronpa and there was a ton of Overwatch voice actors there, I guess,
6584960	6587880	but I just didn't make it out to SAC anime.
6587880	6593360	I went to one of the earlier ones that was like the now destroyed red lion in a panel.
6593360	6597780	We did a panel at SAC anime when it was still, maybe we should look into doing a panel for
6597780	6602400	like the summer version, which I think the good, the game bang guys do.
6602400	6603400	So why not?
6603400	6605840	Maybe we should do something with them about podcasting.
6605840	6606840	Yeah.
6606840	6614500	Offered a Voltron it up like, like we do for, did for gamer X number one game podcasts.
6614500	6616980	So, you know, I don't know if we can touch that.
6616980	6623860	I'm going to assume that was an old banner before they, uh, I know we're going to give
6623860	6627620	them a little shit, but you know, nothing but love for the other indie podcasts.
6627620	6634480	That's number one against what really us, well, no, I mean, I think there's a couple
6634480	6635480	others based.
6635480	6636480	This is Sacramento.
6636480	6641020	Ladies that have a board game podcast, I think video games and that's not video games.
6641020	6643960	So I guess it's just us.
6643960	6646160	And you know what, there's gotta be others.
6646160	6647160	There's so many gaming podcasts.
6647160	6648160	I just don't know about them all.
6648160	6652400	Oh, um, uh, the, the, the, uh, princess Irene had a show.
6652400	6653400	That's right.
6653400	6654400	Is she doing it anymore?
6654400	6656840	I don't know if they put out new episodes lately.
6656840	6662320	I don't know if they have, so yeah, anyway, all right, moving on.
6662320	6666400	Uh, this would be the part of the show where we would get to the mail bag.
6666400	6667400	I should just say it now.
6667400	6670840	I'm doing things out of order, uh, but there are no mails tonight.
6670840	6676680	So if you want to send us an email to read next week, participate at orange lounge, radio.com
6676680	6680200	would be the address to send that to a reminder.
6680200	6681200	Next week.
6681200	6686560	Uh, we're going to have, uh, I believe last I counted for ladies who play Ingress, which
6686560	6687800	is a game we've talked about on the show.
6687800	6691280	I know, I know not all of you are into it, but I thought it would still be fun to talk
6691280	6692280	about.
6692280	6694000	We're not going to nerd out completely about the inner inner workings of it.
6694000	6695000	Cause I don't want to be those.
6695000	6696000	You guys don't play it.
6696000	6697000	I don't want you to be bored.
6697000	6700200	Um, but we are just going to talk about like, you know, kind of more like the why, you know,
6700200	6701920	why do you play a, why is exciting?
6701920	6705000	Cause, um, I think some of these gals do play a lot of other games.
6705000	6706760	I think some of them don't, they only play this.
6706760	6707760	So it'll be kind of a fun show.
6707760	6711480	So if you want to send emails to ask questions about that, uh, you can do that.
6711480	6713920	Participate at orange launch, radio.com, or really you can bring up anything.
6713920	6717240	You want to bring up a topic we talked about tonight or something new participate at orange
6717240	6718240	launch radio.
6718240	6721280	I'm sure that show will never go on tangents.
6721280	6722280	We don't go.
6722280	6723280	I'm a little, yeah.
6723280	6727200	Next week show is probably going to be, and to top it all off, I just want to point out
6727200	6732040	next week is a three day weekend because smart Luther King day is the next Monday.
6732040	6737420	So if I wanted to have a, I have a cocktail during the show.
6737420	6742160	So on top of that, on top of the women taking over the show next week, which is fine.
6742160	6743520	I'm all for all for that.
6743520	6748200	Uh, I might, I may be intoxicated on top of that, so it'd be fun for the makings of a
6748200	6749200	great show.
6749200	6750200	Yeah.
6750200	6751200	It's all, it's all adding up.
6751200	6752200	This will be it.
6752200	6753200	All right.
6753200	6756280	Let's move on to some release dates, although I think it's a little slow this week, right?
6756360	6757360	Yeah.
6757360	6759760	It's still a bit early before the releases come out.
6759760	6764160	They still haven't quite gotten off of their holiday, but we do have a game coming out
6764160	6769000	on the switch of escapists to, we'll be coming on the switch this week and that's literally
6769000	6770000	it.
6770000	6771000	Yeah.
6771000	6773520	The switch has still been pretty good about the digital releases.
6773520	6774520	Yeah.
6774520	6775520	Yeah.
6775520	6776520	And that's true.
6776520	6777520	All right.
6777520	6779700	Well coming out this week in Japan, Dissidia final fantasy NT.
6779700	6780700	That's right.
6780700	6782560	The Dissidia games getting its release in Japan this week.
6782560	6785400	Us still has to wait a couple of weeks past 30th.
6785400	6786400	Yeah.
6786400	6788240	So I am curious though to see some gameplay though of it.
6788240	6789240	Yeah.
6789240	6790240	Some of you.
6790240	6791240	Yeah.
6791240	6792240	I'm very curious about the gameplay and some of you may not be able to wait and may just
6792240	6793240	import it.
6793240	6794240	So that'd be cool.
6794240	6795240	Uh, she, I'll say a shoe.
6795240	6798960	No kind of Indian sign that comes out as well from D three on a PS four this week.
6798960	6804000	And then danganronpa three, uh, gets a price reduction as it moves into the best price.
6804000	6806960	So I think that means there will probably be more danganronpa games.
6806960	6810300	I don't think this will be the end of it, by the way, on the PlayStation Vita where
6810300	6813680	danganronpa V3 also exists in Japan.
6813680	6816060	It is also getting a price reduction over there.
6816060	6819800	So check that out on the 11th, uh, nothing on the Nintendo switch.
6819800	6824600	However, I think Dissidia is kind of the lone Wolf released this week, uh, over in Japan.
6824600	6828940	So I did want to mention as a random, cause I was kind of gleaming through the list for
6828940	6831060	that's coming out for the next few months here.
6831060	6835520	I did notice a title, um, called, what was it?
6835520	6843520	The, um, a certain magical virtual on what a certain magical virtual.
6843520	6846160	On from Sega.
6846160	6849660	It's coming out and PlayStation four and the Vita.
6849660	6850660	Is it from Sega?
6850660	6852760	Uh, it is from Sega.
6852760	6853760	Oh boy.
6853760	6854760	Oh boy.
6854760	6855760	Dars.
6855760	6856760	Oh shit.
6856760	6858080	What is, I think we did.
6858080	6863720	I think I remember, um, something about this where it's, it's sort of like a total magic
6863720	6870680	sooner virtual on, you know, interesting.
6870680	6871680	All right.
6871680	6876640	And, uh, adaption and sequel to the crossover light novel.
6876640	6883920	That was a crossover between, um, the Tawaru series and Denno Senki virtual on.
6883920	6884920	So yeah.
6884920	6889040	Well, Jamie, do we have anything in the UK this week or is it pretty quiet over there?
6889040	6896080	A few things on the 10th, Furi or is it Furi anyway?
6896080	6897560	It's Furi Furi both.
6897560	6899920	And on the 12th, the nightfall for PC.
6899920	6901520	All right.
6901520	6903080	Let's get back into some other news.
6903080	6907640	And pretty soon your calls at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype, Loki, you're
6907640	6908640	excited about this, right?
6908640	6909840	Super hyped about this.
6909840	6913740	So out of all the remasters that they could do, at least they picked a great one.
6913740	6920800	And so coming out this spring, EA will be releasing a remaster of burnout paradise.
6920800	6921800	Woo.
6921800	6922800	Hell yeah.
6922800	6924240	Stan's pretty happy about that.
6924240	6925240	Yeah.
6925240	6926240	This is, this is good news all around.
6926240	6927240	Yeah.
6927240	6928680	So it's going to be a remaster.
6928680	6930680	Um, it's scheduled to launch.
6930680	6932320	But are they still going to have the music licenses?
6932320	6938640	So when I turn it on, take me down to the paradise city, like, is it still gonna, I
6938640	6939640	don't know.
6939640	6940640	Let's hope.
6940640	6945640	Um, but yeah, this was, uh, they, there was an announcement on Twitter, um, talking about
6945640	6948200	the remasters coming out in Japan, March 16.
6948200	6952920	So I'd assume that the U S version probably around the same time, um, no word on music
6952920	6956800	licenses yet and no official confirmation yet either.
6956800	6962560	But hopefully that's soon, uh, act deaf to chat says, I want a new burnout.
6962560	6967400	So I mean, w will you accept this remaster in lieu of a new burnout at least I will accept
6967400	6968400	it for now.
6968400	6969400	It's something, it's a holdover.
6969400	6970720	It's an, it's a nice bandit.
6970720	6972720	It's a nice severance.
6972720	6977600	It's a nice offering from EA who let's be real EA is pissed off a lot of people.
6977600	6981960	So this is a nice little like throw this slab of meat at the pack of wolves.
6981960	6986760	Remember they were developing their like own, like criteria was developing their own like
6986760	6989180	extreme sports game that kind of went under.
6989180	6990180	So dope.
6990180	6995240	Um, I don't remember what they're working on now, but can it be a new burnout game?
6995240	6996240	I mean, come on.
6996240	6997240	Cause it needs for speed.
6997240	6998560	Games have been kind of lame.
6998560	7004120	So I'd be fine with the burnout remake early part of the year and a new burnout game at
7004120	7008180	the end of the year, uh, act Efton chat says, do you still want Avril Lavigne's girlfriend
7008180	7009180	in the game?
7009180	7010180	I forgot that was going to have to have it.
7010180	7013200	You kind of have to, it's, it's a sign of the times at this point.
7013200	7016440	But what I really want to do is I want to replace the music cause you could do this
7016440	7017440	on Xbox 360.
7017440	7019080	You play your custom soundtracks.
7019080	7022440	So why not have my awesome nineties soundtrack?
7022440	7026400	And so I can, you know, when my pink car cause you know, I drive a pink car comes out.
7026400	7027400	I want that.
7027400	7028400	Oh, don't don't.
7028400	7029400	Oh baby.
7029400	7030400	Baby.
7030400	7032360	How was, I suppose.
7032360	7034560	Cause you know, that's how I play burnout.
7034560	7037840	I'm going to have to replace it all with super Euro beat.
7037840	7038840	Super Euro beat.
7038840	7039840	You're driving fast.
7039840	7040840	You kind of have to.
7040840	7041840	It's fair.
7041840	7042840	It's fair.
7042840	7044160	Or just take the sound soundtrack to Wangan midnight maximum.
7044160	7045160	There you go.
7045160	7046160	Yeah.
7046880	7047880	There's more driving there.
7047880	7048880	Yeah, of course.
7048880	7049880	Of course.
7049880	7051480	JD says, replace the music with gay beats.
7051480	7052480	Why not?
7052480	7053480	PlayStation four taps into Spotify.
7053480	7055200	I got my playlist ready to go.
7055200	7058200	Let's do it anyway.
7058200	7059200	I'm down.
7059200	7060200	This is a day one for me.
7060200	7061200	I know.
7061200	7064520	I'm so I'm like, I actually am more excited about burnout paradise right now on my PC.
7064520	7068400	It's like backwards compatible on Xbox one even, isn't it?
7068400	7069400	Uh, yes.
7069400	7070400	Yeah.
7070400	7071400	It is.
7071400	7072400	Um, so yeah.
7072400	7073400	So let's do it.
7073400	7074400	All right.
7074640	7079320	Xbox one, uh, rest in peace connect, uh, the connect pretty much.
7079320	7080360	I mean, I don't know.
7080360	7083480	This is circulating all the blogs this week and I'm kind of like, this is kind of one
7083480	7087920	of those foregone conclusion type of things because when was the last time a connect game
7087920	7088920	came out?
7088920	7089920	It's been a couple of years now.
7089920	7090920	Right?
7090920	7097680	I, yeah, I guess just dance still supports connect, but even just dances technically
7097680	7103960	to the mobile, technically the remakes or remasters of the Disney connect the games
7103960	7108240	supported connect, but they weren't, but then they also made it, but they weren't connected
7108240	7109240	game anymore.
7109240	7110240	Yeah.
7110240	7111240	Yeah.
7111240	7112240	So anyway, here's the deal.
7112240	7113680	The adapters are no longer being made.
7113680	7115920	So Microsoft deceased production of these.
7115920	7119360	You have to have one of these adapters to make the connect work on the Xbox one S and
7119360	7120360	the Xbox one X.
7120360	7124640	Uh, and then in a statement Microsoft said, after careful consideration, we decided to
7124640	7129120	stop manufacturing the Xbox connect adapter to focus attention on launching new higher
7129120	7133720	fan requested gaming accessories across as box Xbox one and windows 10.
7133720	7138560	So of course we don't know what that is, but that could be anything from hollow lens coming
7138560	7143860	out events early, who knows to whatever else Microsoft may be working on random PR speak
7143860	7149760	that just, you know, and again, I was, I kind of already had said my goodbye to the connect.
7149760	7154700	You know, I think ever since they uncoupled the connect from the Xbox one, we all kind
7154700	7155880	of saw this coming.
7155880	7161360	Um, you know, but I think as much as people want to look back and go, Oh God, the connect
7161360	7162640	was kind of garbage.
7162640	7163640	Was it though?
7163640	7168040	Like people were really into it when it first came for games again, cause I realized there's
7168040	7170400	a whole nother side to this for games.
7170400	7173760	People were really into dance central and I fucking love dance center.
7173760	7174760	It was awesome.
7174760	7175760	Pretty awesome.
7175760	7176760	It was pretty deep.
7176760	7179000	When the games were good, they were really good when they were bad.
7179040	7180040	It was obvious.
7180040	7183640	It was a problem where like a lot of companies didn't know how to utilize it and they came
7183640	7189960	up with like a bunch and even Microsoft, you know, the, they, they did a lot of this, you
7189960	7194200	know, where it's like you can shout grenade and you throw a grenade.
7194200	7199200	It's like, really is that much more convenient than pushing a button to throw a grenade is,
7199200	7204680	is that really, you know, they have like, Oh, you could do all this voice searching
7204680	7205680	and stuff like that.
7205680	7214320	And, um, you know, the Xbox and honestly like I've got voice search on my, um, my media
7214320	7217400	box, my Android TV or whatever.
7217400	7218400	Never use it.
7218400	7222560	So I thought you had to have a connect to do live streaming on Twitch through Xbox one,
7222560	7224760	but is it true now that it supports any USB camera?
7224760	7227920	Cause I thought I heard Bobby say that on his show and I was like, Whoa, that's news
7227920	7228920	to me.
7228920	7230360	I could have been streaming on Xbox one this whole time.
7230360	7231360	Didn't even realize it.
7231360	7232360	Yeah.
7233040	7237260	Cause I have an old camera cause I upgraded the camera in the studio or in my office that
7237260	7239780	I use with the green screen for, for Twitch and everything.
7239780	7243000	But I saw my old camera, which isn't bad and I could use that on my Xbox one.
7243000	7247340	So even with just the streaming stuff where like the camera followed you around, if you're
7247340	7251700	walking around, that was kind of cool, but like one, since you're kind of bridging it
7251700	7254720	to it, it did a lot for, you know, non game stuff.
7254720	7259140	Like we've all heard the story about how connect was great in hospitals because it allowed
7259140	7262860	people to, you know, keep the environment sterile because when you're using motion and
7262860	7266620	not using the actual tools or anything, you're just using, you know, air, you're not getting
7266620	7269180	anything dirty so you can keep the environment sterile.
7269180	7274900	So, you know, connect has done a lot of great things for, you know, other types of stuff
7274900	7279820	that isn't just games, but it brought Para to the Xbox three six.
7279820	7280820	Why not?
7280820	7281820	Why not?
7281820	7282820	Because they had dance paradise.
7282820	7283820	That's true.
7283820	7284820	They had dance paradise.
7284820	7286420	It was a terrible game, but it could have been better.
7286420	7288780	It was just, it was hard to, it was hard to understand.
7288780	7292860	Next to dance central, dance central kind of, yeah, dance central is much better.
7292860	7299540	Although, although if we're going to be fair, dead central, while it was an excellent game,
7299540	7305660	if it weren't for Dan central, we wouldn't have the stupid dancing game that was in star
7305660	7306660	Wars connect.
7306660	7309900	I was about to say star Wars connect was kind of the beginning of the end.
7309900	7310900	Yes.
7310900	7311900	Star Wars connect.
7311900	7312900	No.
7312900	7313900	Yeah.
7313900	7314900	That was kind of the beginning of the end.
7314900	7318600	Bad, bad Microsoft and a Bobby confirming in our chat at live.vognetwork.com it does
7318640	7320200	support USB cameras as of October.
7320200	7321360	See, that's news to me.
7321360	7322360	So that's awesome.
7322360	7323360	Cool.
7323360	7326600	So, well, you know, who knows the connect maybe back in some other form or technology.
7326600	7327600	I hope not.
7327600	7329240	Well, I don't, here's the thing.
7329240	7334480	I think the whole like dual cameras to kind of sense like space and stuff like that kind
7334480	7340560	of like you see that type of technology in mobile phones at this point, like how does
7340560	7342560	Apple's portrait mode work?
7342560	7343560	It's kind of similar.
7343560	7348880	I mean, it's, it's different, but it's, or the face scanning technology is just, it's
7348880	7351000	not that dissimilar from connect.
7351000	7354600	It's just a lot more advanced because it's many more fricking laser beams going at your
7354600	7355600	face.
7355600	7361760	So I think the legacy of this technology is going to be in devices from here on out.
7361760	7365320	But as far as connects time and gaming, we're done.
7365320	7366760	I just don't want them to release it.
7366760	7369840	They better not release another connect with the next system or something like that.
7369840	7371160	I hope they don't do something like that.
7371160	7375400	Because I've already been burned so many times, so I, I don't trust them anymore.
7375400	7380480	All right, let's move on with some more stories and I think you have something for us, right
7380480	7381480	Jamie?
7381480	7382480	I do.
7382480	7383480	Don't I?
7383480	7384480	You sure do.
7384480	7385480	I think it's a world traveling story.
7385480	7386480	Yep.
7386480	7389080	It's about Spain.
7389080	7398400	Basically a lot of independent developers in Spain are pretty much going to be really
7398400	7399400	unhappy.
7399400	7408280	They have had a, there's been a decision passed on in the government to block 2 million euros,
7408280	7417760	which is about 2.4 million dollars in European Union funding for local gaming, for game development.
7417760	7425860	The minister of energy, tourism and digital agenda, Alvaro Nadal, canceled the grant,
7425860	7429580	which was going to go to 20 different developers.
7429580	7435340	Each developer would have received between 50,000 and 150,000 euros.
7435340	7440060	And some of them were for teams of five people or fewer who were working on their first game.
7440060	7448740	So it's really been a major, a major hurdle, I really, some of the most recent games and
7448740	7454620	forthcoming games that were coming out of Spain was Crossing Souls from 4 Attic, Metroid,
7454620	7461540	Samus Returns from Mercury, Steam, and Rime and the Sexy Brutale from Tequila Works.
7461540	7468820	So and then basically now, there's been an update to this since I first read it, is that
7468820	7474740	they are working on restructuring the grant rather than cutting it completely so that
7474740	7479420	they, I guess, can make sure that the money will be used wisely and used efficiently.
7479420	7486800	So I guess they are doing it, but then again, just that first announcement just seemed like
7486800	7488720	quite the blow.
7488720	7495340	So just a reminder that games come from all sorts of places, not just the US and Canada.
7495340	7496340	Totally.
7496340	7497340	So just a reminder.
7497340	7498340	All right.
7498340	7502940	And Japan, of course, I can't leave them out, but you know, games come from Europe as well.
7502940	7503940	All right.
7503940	7504940	Loki.
7505460	7509700	All right, so there's a brand new expansion, or no, it was a mod that's being worked on
7509700	7514540	that expands Skyrim because, you know, there's a ton of those, but this one's been in the
7514540	7522020	works since 2015, and it's an expansion mod called Lordbound, and basically they've added
7522020	7528460	about 15 to 30 hours of extra content, tons of new dungeons and whatnot.
7528460	7533700	It's supposed to be taking place in a location called Drudatch Valley, which they say is
7533700	7539940	a new location, not in Skyrim, but it sits between High Rock and Skyrim.
7539940	7548500	So since I don't know shit about the Elder Scrolls geography, cool, I guess.
7548500	7553540	But it does look really neat, and so I guess if you want to check it out, they have more
7553540	7558620	progress that you can follow up on, on a ModDB.
7558620	7561140	But yeah, it's coming soon.
7561580	7564260	2018 is what they're shooting for, for a release for it.
7564260	7565260	It looks really cool.
7565260	7568820	When do you think we're going to get an Elder Scrolls VI to fuck around with?
7568820	7572140	Like you know, Skyrim's been out a while now, like I know it's like, it's all new again
7572140	7575140	because of the Switch, but in reality, that game is aging.
7575140	7576620	Hopefully soon.
7576620	7580540	They've kind of, I don't know if there's supposed to be another Fallout game, like if they've
7580540	7584220	got another team doing almost like a Fallout Vegas, or a New Vegas, or if we're going to
7584220	7589300	get any more remasters, maybe like a remaster of like a Fallout New Vegas or something,
7589300	7590860	which I'd play that.
7590860	7593740	I need to go and finish four.
7593740	7598540	The problem with four is I already know how it ends, and I don't want to go back into
7598540	7599540	it.
7599540	7602380	But I bought all the season pass stuff, which is probably a mistake if I haven't played
7602380	7603380	through any of that.
7603380	7604380	Oh, just check it out.
7604380	7606700	Kaijuto in chat says, this mod sounds awful.
7606700	7612500	It could be, but 38 hours extra content, I mean, being that I've already dropped several
7612500	7616460	thousands of hours into Skyrim, why not more?
7616460	7621540	I do want at some point to stream stuff, and Skyrim would definitely be one of my first
7621540	7622540	choices.
7622540	7623540	Do it.
7623540	7624540	Do it.
7624540	7625540	All right.
7625540	7628460	Well, last but not least tonight, and y'all were wondering when I was going to officially
7628460	7630780	bring it up, I saved the best for last, y'all.
7630780	7634300	I wanted to mention, and I think it's already kind of been mentioned tonight, because I'm
7634300	7638740	sure a lot of you have noticed, you may be watching it in another tab, but awesome Games
7638740	7641860	Done Quick is underway.
7641860	7643380	You can check it out, of course, on Twitch.
7643380	7646660	You can also look at their website, gamesdonequick.com.
7646660	7650860	They have a full schedule posted over at Games Done Quick, and I think right now, what are
7650860	7651860	they on?
7651860	7654300	Were there any, because I know they, oh, excuse me.
7654300	7658180	They started Blaster Master Zero while we were mid-show, so I think they're about to,
7658180	7661380	they're still on probably Batman Arkham Asylum, it sounds like, and they're about to get into
7661380	7665660	Little Big Planet 2, where they're going to do a co-op speed run on New Game Plus.
7665660	7666660	So that'll be interesting.
7666660	7667740	Remember Little Big Planet?
7667740	7668740	I know.
7668740	7669740	I mentioned it today.
7669740	7672100	I was like, man, I should play a little bit, because I saw it when I was looking at the
7672100	7673100	roster.
7673820	7677980	I'm like, I have Little Big Planet 3 sitting in my library, and I have yet to play it.
7677980	7680460	I think I played Little Big Planet 2.
7680460	7682340	I think I did.
7682340	7690140	But what's interesting is that there is not, I don't believe it was noted, Super Metroid
7690140	7691140	is not there.
7691140	7692140	Super Metroid, that's kind of the point.
7692140	7695140	But the last day, check out this lineup for the last day.
7695140	7696140	You ready for this?
7696140	7699700	Dark Soccer is going to wake up at 6 a.m. on the last day, Saturday.
7699700	7700700	Why?
7700700	7701700	Because that's the Mass Effect speed run.
7702220	7706540	No, I'm not going to watch a speed run of a game that I enjoy for the story.
7706540	7707540	What a spoilsport.
7707540	7713380	I do want to see, and I watched it last year in the archives or whatever, the random...
7713380	7714820	Yeah, you can always watch it on YouTube.
7714820	7720940	The random item, Link to the Past run, where they shuffle all the items in the game.
7720940	7722060	But check out this closing day.
7722060	7729020	Mass Effect, Warcraft 3 through the Human Campaign, Diablo playing a sorcerer, Baldur's
7729020	7735660	Gate 2, Bloodborne, Final Fantasy IV, Zelda Link to the Past, Mario World, and then lastly
7735660	7740940	the big finale tonight, or the last night, Zelda Breath of the Wild.
7740940	7742580	So there you go.
7742580	7744340	And then who knows whatever little surprises may...
7744340	7747460	The Breath of the Wild one's going to be 13 minutes.
7747460	7748980	No, I think they...
7748980	7749980	I think...
7749980	7752540	Unless they're saying that you have to do a certain amount of stuff, but the...
7752540	7754060	Yeah, I think it's a certain amount of stuff.
7754060	7758980	But the, I think the world record right now for Breath of the Wild is like 10 minutes.
7758980	7761380	They're anticipating three hours for that run, so...
7761380	7767420	So they must be doing like all the shrines or something.
7767420	7768420	Yeah.
7768420	7772660	And I noticed in chat over at live.vognetware.com, Rock Hat says, I hate speedruns, but I do
7772660	7774220	laugh at speedrun fails.
7774220	7776620	Well, they've had a few fails through this whole thing.
7776620	7779580	And even if you hate speedruns, I mean, it is for a good cause.
7779580	7783900	So it's, you know, it's for the Prevent Cancer Foundation is where all the money is going
7783900	7785420	this time around, so...
7785420	7790140	The things I don't mind about speedruns though, is I love, well, you know, I have a minor
7790140	7793580	obsession with, with glitches, you know?
7793580	7797580	So I like watching the glitches and learning like where people have found the games are
7797580	7799060	broken or going out of bounds.
7799060	7805200	Well, I mean, that's what I was doing in WoW, remember when I got my, my Demon Hunter?
7805200	7809940	I was going in all the old dungeons and exploring and posting screenshots and stuff.
7809940	7810980	I love doing that.
7810980	7816500	I like people that really work hard at these obscure fucking games.
7816500	7820500	Like people that'll be like, I can speedrun such and such on the 3DO or something where
7820500	7822340	it's like, you're probably the only person in the world.
7822340	7823940	I'm the expert at running Pepsi man.
7823940	7824940	Yeah, exactly.
7824940	7825940	But there's people like that.
7825940	7828740	Like I've, I've watched some of these people that are really into these like obscure ass
7828740	7829740	games.
7829740	7830740	And I think that like, I like that.
7830740	7833300	I like watching them talking about the history of the game and stuff like that.
7833300	7835180	And they talk about like why they like the game so much.
7835180	7837040	There's usually some kind of history behind it.
7837040	7838580	That's the stuff I really like.
7838620	7841500	I actually am not as, but you'd be surprised.
7841500	7846060	The Super Metroid running thing is kind of, I, I don't get quite the same thrill out of
7846060	7847260	that as maybe the first time I saw it.
7847260	7850380	I want to see a speedrun of Magic Pen Jell.
7850380	7852380	Hah!
7852380	7855940	Maybe, maybe you need to be the one to learn Magic Pen Jell.
7855940	7856940	Oh my god.
7856940	7857940	All phallic mode.
7857940	7858940	All phallic.
7858940	7859940	Yes.
7859940	7863940	For those who don't remember, which I would think that game is eligible to be Classic
7863940	7864940	Game of the Week now.
7864940	7865940	But anyway, just saying.
7866060	7873100	Magic Pen Jell was like a Pokemon-ish game on Sony, but you drew all the characters in
7873100	7874100	like 3D.
7874100	7878460	Yeah, you drew your characters sort of in 3D and it was basically, depending on what
7878460	7879460	colors you used.
7879460	7881100	Dicks, dicks, dicks, and more dicks.
7881100	7882140	That's all anybody ever drew.
7882140	7885000	Whatever colors you used, you gave you different abilities and stuff.
7885000	7889740	And so you could just draw like a big ugly blotch of something and it'd be like the most
7889740	7890740	powerful thing ever.
7890740	7891740	Exactly.
7891740	7895860	But yes, usually it was just drawing dongs, lots of dongs, dongs everywhere.
7895860	7902500	I think we had like a 2DX controller that was a character one time, but mainly dongs.
7902500	7903500	Oh yeah.
7903500	7906860	Yeah, I think somebody made like a 2DX controller or something as a Pokemon.
7906860	7908660	Just all these silly things.
7908660	7911460	So anyway, Magic Pen Jell.
7911460	7914180	That's a game that needs to be, that's the game I want to see a remaster for.
7914180	7915980	Who made Magic Pen Jell?
7915980	7916980	I don't remember.
7916980	7917980	They did a sequel.
7917980	7918980	It was called Graffiti Kingdom.
7918980	7921340	That was like a brawler stuff.
7921340	7922900	Brawler type game.
7922900	7926220	But I don't remember the company that made it.
7926220	7928300	Hold on, I'm looking it up.
7928300	7929300	I know, I'm looking right now.
7929300	7930300	It was...
7930300	7931300	Taito.
7931300	7932300	Taito, yeah.
7932300	7934020	Taito published it in Japan.
7934020	7935020	And H2...
7935020	7936020	Garakuta Studio.
7936020	7937020	Yeah.
7937020	7938020	505 Games.
7938020	7941900	The original name was called Doodle Kingdom.
7941900	7944580	Well, Rakugaya Okoku.
7944580	7945580	I made a doodle.
7945580	7947540	Hey, uh, phone lines are open by the way.
7947540	7948540	You can give us a call.
7948540	7951580	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you'd like to give us a call.
7951580	7954660	If you want to do it the old school way, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7954660	7956300	But Orange Lounge Radio on Skype should be the preferred one.
7956300	7958260	Look at that, third picture in Graffiti Kingdom.
7958260	7961420	Already found a dick wearing a top hat.
7961420	7966140	Ah, internet, you don't let me down.
7966140	7968780	That would be Sir John Thomas to you.
7968780	7973540	It's actually Chody is his name.
7973540	7975540	Lord.
7975540	7976540	Write that down.
7976540	7977540	Someone call.
7977540	7980420	Whenever we get into that Orange Lounge Radio charity stream we've been talking about for
7980420	7981420	years.
7981420	7982860	Magic Pen Gel needs to be the kick off game.
7982860	7983860	For sure.
7983860	7984860	For sure.
7984860	7988660	Uh, again, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the old school way to do it.
7988660	7992940	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you'd like to give us a call.
7992940	7997340	And apparently, somebody's trying to call us and it says we're unavailable.
7997340	7998340	That's not good.
7998340	8000980	Let me see if I can do it on my phone just to make sure everything's working.
8000980	8003880	Because Bobby called us earlier and that worked.
8003880	8005900	So I think the connection's working.
8005900	8009820	But then again, Skype can kind of be a pain in the butt sometimes.
8009820	8012380	So I just don't know.
8012380	8016300	So if maybe somebody wants to help me fill a little time here while I do a test call.
8016300	8020340	So as I was talking about the remaster of Burnout Paradise coming out on PlayStation
8020340	8025660	4, not only is it rumored to come out on PlayStation 4, but the Xbox One and the Switch.
8025660	8028440	So you can be playing Burnout Paradise on the Switch.
8028440	8029440	That's pretty awesome.
8029440	8034300	Yeah, I just did a test call and it worked.
8034300	8038620	So yeah.
8038620	8039620	Well those of you that...
8039620	8040620	I think SSG100...
8040620	8041620	So I gotta ask...
8041620	8045820	Well, Bobby's not calling obviously, but the big thing I've been seeing that a lot of the
8045820	8051300	streamers have been playing since it's a really retarded looking Second Life thing is VR chat.
8051300	8052300	Oh yes.
8052300	8053300	I've seen this too.
8053300	8054300	I've seen some of the YouTubes.
8054300	8055300	It looks hilarious.
8055300	8056300	It looks stupid.
8056300	8057300	It's some of the worst.
8057300	8058300	It's dumb.
8058300	8064500	Yeah, a lot of the stuff I've seen is the worst parts of gaming all in one little...
8064500	8066380	Let them all live on VR chat island.
8066380	8067380	That's fine.
8067380	8068380	But I find...
8069140	8071300	Any new technology that comes out.
8071300	8073940	It's like we were just talking about Magic Pen Gel.
8073940	8077300	Here's a pen so you can draw whatever you want.
8077300	8079460	Chodymon is the first thing I'm going to draw.
8079460	8084940	Like that's the thing is that you introduce society to a new technology and inevitably
8084940	8086740	the first place you're going to take it is the gutter.
8086740	8089420	But those people are always going to draw dicks no matter what it is.
8089420	8092340	They're always going to draw dicks, their name's always going to be Chody.
8092340	8093460	It doesn't matter.
8093460	8094980	That's that person's thing.
8094980	8097860	But then there are people that are like, I'm always going to create a Gundam.
8097860	8100100	I'm always going to create Hatsune Miku.
8100100	8107020	I'm going to do whatever and I'm fine with that.
8107020	8108780	It was just, it was really dumb.
8108780	8110020	But I watched it the other day.
8110020	8111620	It's just, it was so dumb.
8111620	8112620	It was hilarious.
8112620	8114580	So it's like memes all over the place.
8114580	8116780	Azzette in chat said rule 34 Rob.
8116780	8117780	Yeah, that's true.
8117780	8118780	That's true.
8118780	8124380	Bobby Blackwell says it's not easy to create things for VR chat.
8124380	8126100	It looks hilarious though.
8126100	8127340	Okay.
8127340	8128340	We do have a call coming in.
8128340	8130260	I think this guy got his Skype issues resolved.
8130260	8132540	So I think we can talk to him higher on orange on radio.
8132540	8133540	Who's this?
8133540	8134540	Hey guys, it's us.
8134540	8135540	You're on your mat.
8135540	8136540	Hey buddy.
8136540	8137540	I was hoping you'd call in.
8137540	8139740	Cause you are fresh back from magfest.
8139740	8140740	Aren't you?
8140740	8141740	Yeah.
8141740	8145740	I just got back about two hours ago and that was a long drive from what I remember.
8145740	8150300	Magfest is different from most cons I go to because the last day is like super cut short.
8150300	8152140	Like they, they pull the plugs at noon or something.
8152140	8153140	Right?
8153140	8154140	Like it's, it's over.
8154140	8155140	Yeah.
8155180	8160620	I was in my car and driving at one o'clock didn't get home until, yeah, not that long
8160620	8161620	ago.
8161620	8162620	So, well, how was it?
8162620	8167420	I know magfest had a lot of, it had a lot of issues with the hotel and all that stuff.
8167420	8169700	People worried they wouldn't find a place to park.
8169700	8172620	How did it all work out when she got there?
8172620	8179040	Once it was there, you know, it kind of just felt like any other magfest.
8179040	8181020	Things were a little bit different.
8181020	8185980	Hotels, it seemed like for the most part for me, like I managed to get a room at the
8185980	8186980	Gaylord.
8186980	8187980	Lucky enough.
8187980	8192260	If you feel a little guilty about it, but cause so many people didn't, but.
8192260	8193460	No, you shouldn't.
8193460	8195180	You've been, you've been promoting me.
8195180	8197020	You're one of the people that got me to go to magfest.
8197020	8199980	You, you're, you're, you're just as worthy as some other guy of getting the, uh.
8199980	8200980	That's true.
8200980	8206580	But you know, like I have several friends who like had to drive like 45 minutes to and
8206580	8209020	from and like some people like had to take an Uber.
8209020	8210300	That's, that's such a pain.
8210300	8214660	And I get it like the Gaylord in, and if you don't know this venue, cause it's over out
8214660	8218700	in the Washington DC area, it's technically National Harbor, Maryland, but um, you know,
8218700	8220620	they, they do big political events there.
8220620	8225620	Like I seem to remember like a week after the last magfest that I went to.
8225620	8227980	It's like CPAC is, is in the grand ballroom.
8227980	8228980	Yeah.
8228980	8234340	Like, uh, 45 was there doing a speech or something and it was all over CNN and I was like, oh,
8234340	8235340	that's weird.
8235340	8236340	Cause I was just there at that same hotel.
8236340	8237540	But anyway, it's a gorgeous hotel.
8237540	8239860	So it's like, once you get to the venue, it's great.
8239860	8242700	But the problem with National Harbor is it's like super isolated cause it kind of like
8242700	8246700	sticks out into the, you know, there's only like a couple of roads in and out of there.
8246700	8247700	Yep, exactly.
8247700	8251980	And yeah, no, it's just like it's, it was so cold this year.
8251980	8252980	Oh yeah.
8252980	8258780	Cause we just managed to manage to avoid that big snow bomb, whatever it's called.
8258780	8259780	Oh yeah.
8259780	8261260	It was still like negative.
8261260	8263420	The bomb cyclone or whatever they're calling it.
8263420	8264420	Yeah.
8264420	8266380	So then it was still like minus five outside.
8266380	8268300	Oh, I'm kind of.
8268340	8271060	In that regard, I'm kind of glad I skipped this year.
8271060	8274960	You do remember though, because I remember you gave me mad props because I was out there
8274960	8277940	doing Ingress missions in 20 degree weather last year.
8277940	8278940	Yeah.
8278940	8279940	You don't know.
8279940	8284420	But you know, I didn't, I didn't, I miss, I messed up my streak so bad in Pokemon Go
8284420	8287300	this weekend cause I did not want to go outside.
8287300	8290900	I'm surprised there weren't a million pokey things going on in the hotel.
8290900	8293580	I thought I remember there were a lot of, um, at least Ingress things.
8293580	8295700	Oh, pokey things happened in the hotel.
8296460	8300500	Actually, I think my Gyarados is from National Harbor.
8300500	8301500	No, no.
8301500	8302780	I was just like, you know what?
8302780	8307380	It's just one of those things that I neglected to flip on cause I was so busy doing other
8307380	8308380	things.
8308380	8309380	That's fair.
8309380	8310380	Well, let's talk about those other things a little bit.
8310380	8314660	So I know there was some controversy about Tokyo Attack no longer doing the video game
8314660	8315660	room.
8315660	8318660	I don't know if they worked that out or what, but the arcade room kind of looks like it
8318660	8320660	was, it was all right after all, right?
8320660	8321660	Yeah, no.
8321660	8325220	Um, well they did not work out their dispute with Tokyo Attack.
8325740	8331420	They managed to, I don't know who it was, but they managed to meet up with another Tokyo
8331420	8337860	Attack-like group and so they had just, you know, the big concern was with Tokyo Attack
8337860	8346420	who handles a lot of the Japanese, um, music games and, and a lot of like other Japan games
8346420	8349060	that have been at like a lot of other magfests.
8349060	8352180	So they were, a lot of people were concerned like there's not going to be any DDR, there's
8352180	8353820	not going to be Poppin.
8353860	8359260	They managed to find someone else, I don't know who, who it is, and they managed to bring
8359260	8361500	in a lot of those machines.
8361500	8363180	So like it wasn't really missed.
8363180	8367340	There was a ton of DDR machines, they still had UB, they still had some of the newer stuff.
8367340	8371180	They didn't have all the new stuff, but they still had a pretty darn good share of it.
8371180	8375220	So, you know, they did, you know, so they found a new partner and a lot of chatters
8375220	8378540	pointing out that Tokyo Attack is actually at Awesome Games Done Quick right now.
8378540	8382300	So, and I think, I feel like they were doing that before anyway, even when they were doing
8382300	8386900	Magfest, they kind of packed all that shit up and, because what is, is Awesome Games
8386900	8389420	Done Quick still just on the other side of town right now?
8389420	8390420	It is.
8390420	8394660	And it's actually, it's in the same hotel where the original Magfest was, I believe.
8394660	8395660	Oh shit.
8395660	8396660	Okay.
8396660	8401140	So, you know, it's like, so like you have like a lot of, there were like, um, there
8401140	8404740	were like a lot of like speed runners who are at Magfest as well.
8404740	8409660	So like there were a couple like Mega Man speed runners who were doing the Mega Manathon,
8409660	8415260	which is a big speed run marathon that they do at Magfest where they go through all the
8415260	8417100	Mega Man games and speed run them.
8417100	8423220	And then there was a popular Kingdom Hearts speed runner who did his own thing.
8423220	8426580	I'm not surprised some people make a really long week of it, although that's a long time
8426580	8430300	to be away, but for students and stuff, it might be a little easier to swing that sort
8430300	8431300	of time away.
8431300	8434180	I heard they made some changes to the concert hall this year.
8434180	8436260	Did you like the new layout?
8436260	8437260	They did.
8437260	8438260	The layout was a bit different.
8438260	8442700	I mean, so to kind of give everybody some context, the original layout for the main
8442700	8447580	concert room was they had two stages on opposite ends of this big hall.
8447580	8454460	So that way, in their mind, was to kind of set up one concert while the other one was
8454460	8456540	still going on.
8456540	8463460	The problems you kind of run into is that the bands were able to set up, but the, I
8463500	8468460	guess, the sound crew, they weren't able to do sound checks properly.
8468460	8471340	So they managed to just consolidate into one big stage.
8471340	8475260	Oh, I remember the sound issues being a problem last year, too.
8475260	8476660	So this was their solution.
8476660	8478320	Okay, that makes sense then.
8478320	8486320	So things kind of ran a lot more efficiently and also just, you know, the quality was better.
8486320	8493240	So there were maybe slightly fewer concerts this year, but on the upside, every single
8493240	8497280	concert started on time, every single concert pretty much ended on time.
8497280	8498800	That is good.
8498800	8501520	So everything just kind of worked out a bit smoother there.
8501520	8505240	So they didn't switch, did they switch the orientation of the room where like the one
8505240	8508960	stage was in the center of where it was before, or did they just use one side and that was
8508960	8509960	it?
8509960	8512320	They used the more centered part of it.
8512320	8513320	Okay, interesting.
8513320	8514760	So it kind of looks like they rotated the room.
8514760	8516760	That would be kind of interesting.
8516760	8517760	Yeah.
8517760	8525280	The BF enough, for the most part, MagFest was pretty much about the same.
8525280	8527600	Well, that's good.
8527600	8528600	What was the...
8528600	8529600	We're still...
8529600	8530600	Go ahead.
8530600	8531600	You first.
8531600	8532600	Oh.
8532600	8538360	So like, well, some of the negatives were like it was noticeably crowded.
8538360	8546900	It was extremely crowded, especially Friday evenings and all of Saturday.
8546900	8551840	So they might have hit their capacity, did they claim a sellout or no?
8551840	8558040	They did not, but I'm curious because I think like a lot of people, like in the weeks leading
8558040	8563140	up to MagFest, the months, a lot of people were selling their badges because they couldn't
8563140	8565840	make it, because they couldn't get a room.
8565840	8571160	So I don't know, like it may have been like a lot of local people, a lot of...
8571160	8577240	But it was like a lot of people, like the past couple of days, the last day or two was...
8577240	8583220	There was their first MagFest, because they heard it was kind of like a big party, so...
8583220	8584720	Place to go drink.
8584720	8589760	So what was the coolest thing you saw at MagFest?
8589760	8594640	Coolest thing I saw was I was able to only catch a little bit of it, because timing and
8594640	8595640	panels and everything.
8595640	8597920	So the old show Nick Arcade...
8597920	8598920	Oh yeah, I heard about this.
8598920	8599920	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8599920	8600920	Yeah.
8601440	8610640	They managed to get Phil Moore, the original host of Nick Arcade.
8610640	8616360	So they kind of did their own version of Nick Arcade with a couple of the indie games as
8616360	8618320	kind of like the game challenges.
8618320	8619320	Smart.
8619320	8621080	So that was kind of cool.
8621080	8627800	So they did that last year, but it didn't really like work out too well.
8627800	8632760	But they had Phil Moore this year do it, and they did two showings.
8632760	8639120	They did one with contestants from the crowd, and second night was special guests.
8639120	8643160	They had Freddie Wong on there doing it as well.
8643160	8644380	So it was...
8644380	8646480	He kind of just didn't skip a beat.
8646480	8651720	Was it like seeing the same guy from the 90s television, just right there in person?
8651720	8652720	That's awesome.
8652720	8661960	It was down to him making songs or spitting rhymes during the musical segments, if you
8661960	8663640	can kind of remember, during the show.
8663640	8664640	Yeah, I do.
8664640	8665640	I do.
8665640	8666640	I love it.
8666640	8672440	So one more question I have for you, and then we'll let you go see if we get any other calls.
8672440	8678000	As has been pointed out a couple of times, it was noted that the gentleman who invented
8678000	8683160	the Colossus roar, the infamous roar that happens at MAGFest, which kind of sounds like
8683160	8688480	roar, roar, like a lot of people, and it gets louder and louder as more people join in.
8688480	8693360	And truth be told, I kind of get annoyed with it by the last day of MAGFest.
8693360	8698960	However, seeing that there's a little more sentimentalness to it this year, I probably
8698960	8704220	would have made it the whole MAGFest and just silently nodded, what have you.
8704220	8706280	But the guy passed away.
8706280	8714840	So was the Colossus Roars in full force this year because of that?
8714840	8721360	So on the machine that was his, they had a dedication and everything of him, and apparently
8721360	8723400	Stan Lee had signed the cabinet as well.
8723400	8724400	What?
8724400	8725400	What?
8725400	8726400	Oh, that's cool.
8726400	8727400	Yeah.
8727400	8732680	But no, I think there were a bunch, just kind of like the usual amount.
8732680	8733680	All right.
8733680	8734680	So the usual amount, which is lots.
8734680	8740320	And I think people were able to kind of find out what the actual full story of it was now,
8740320	8743240	because where it came from, why people do it.
8743240	8744240	Exactly.
8744240	8747400	And that was kind of my point, where it's like, well, now that I know the story, it's
8747400	8749800	harder to be annoyed with it.
8749800	8750800	You know what I mean?
8750800	8756080	And to kind of quickly tell it for context to everybody who's listening, the story behind
8756080	8761360	it is when they first started doing MAGFest, they had a couple of arcade machines, and
8761360	8767540	one of the big things that they got was the 6-man X-Men arcade machine.
8767540	8773480	And the machine's volume was turned up all the way, so during the whole show, anybody
8773480	8780480	who's doing Colossus' super, you get the roar, constantly going.
8780480	8785040	So that became kind of like the battle cry of MAGFest.
8785040	8788000	Well, there's the story.
8788000	8789000	Yeah?
8789000	8790000	Yeah.
8790000	8791000	All right.
8791000	8795040	We're gonna let you go see if we get any other calls in here, but thanks so much for the call. I appreciate it
8795040	8799120	Yep, you're welcome. All right. Go on. Take care of my friend. Yep. Bye. Bye
8800060	8806600	Yeah, Bobby black wolf and chat points out everybody everybody at magfest heard it all 1,000 attendees. That's why it's so iconic
8806600	8808600	Yeah, well, it's hard to get away from that
8808720	8812200	Colossus for let's get into some other calls here at chat
8813560	8818880	Including this call. Hi, you're on orange on radio. Who's this? What's going on people? It's Ron man. Happy new year
8818880	8821660	Hey, Rama, happy new year. It's great to hear from you. What's on your mind?
8827200	8833560	From a con freezing my butt off these cold winds, but since we're talking magfest
8834360	8838580	Yeah, let me tell you what really happened with Tokyo attack. Oh
8839420	8846200	Okay. Sure cuz I found this out through some staffers. Um, cuz right here in New York
8846200	8853960	We have like the underground staffing network, which is a combination of con staffers between several conventions in this area
8853960	8860360	I am out at a party having a good time reconnecting with some people and a few people are asking me about
8861280	8868420	Magfest I'm like, I'm not going because of the BS with the tickets and I'll tell I'm like I'll deal with it the following year
8869080	8875720	And during the conversation I found out what really happened with Tokyo attack per se
8876920	8878920	Whatever they were arguing about
8879960	8887200	That's what it was. It seems that a bunch of arcade collectors stepped up and said
8887880	8890320	Y'all don't need Tokyo attack. We got this
8892480	8895340	Interesting so somebody kind of basically made in and made a counteroffer
8896120	8900400	Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I don't remember full details that but I do know
8901200	8908740	From this point on when you go to mag fest now, you see all these arcade machines. These are from people's personal collections
8910200	8914720	Well to be fair, you know and we are hearing from SSU 100 Matt who said, you know
8914720	8916580	The arcade room was still fine, you know
8916580	8919880	And somebody it was either him or Ziba sent me a picture of an f-zero
8920200	8922840	Ax machine which there wasn't even that many of those in the u.s
8922840	8926000	To begin with so the fact that they have one of those at mag fest was pretty impressive
8926000	8929040	So, you know mag fest arcade they did fine for themselves
8929320	8934840	And we know the Tokyo attack had plenty of time to set up and do a good show over awesome games done quick
8934840	8938880	So is this just maybe a everybody wins scenario? I
8939840	8941320	Tend to think so
8941320	8946400	But given some of the stuff that I've been talking with a lot of staffers and non staffers
8946400	8950960	I mean if you're going to tell the story at least kind of tell it right
8951400	8952240	Okay
8952240	8956440	Well, you know but some some of it's a little bit drama and it's like, you know what?
8956440	8959840	That's why I'm trying to focus on is everybody happy. Yes. Okay, great
8963440	8968360	Yeah, well that's good well what so you say do you said you went to a convention this weekend yes
8969960	8976320	Understand I have a soft spot for little local college conventions and I love them sure
8976400	8978400	Little conventions to
8980480	8981760	Yeah
8981760	8987880	We went me and Marco are we went to this Conco Katori car at a local college campus
8989000	8996960	They have like a little Friday get-together. Then the actual cars in three buildings on the campus and normally it's
8997560	8999280	in January
8999280	9005680	So you don't expect to walk around in the cold weather switching between buildings
9006320	9008320	I
9008440	9010440	Are yeah
9010960	9015440	And you were posting about stuff that was going on at sac anime all the way out here
9015440	9020920	That's kind of what made me laugh as I was like, wow, Sammy's getting big enough to where this it's not
9021880	9023880	It's more like what?
9024720	9026720	I guess it is a lot of
9026880	9034100	Obviously a lot of fucking bullshit going on in the communities and there's a lot of people who look at me as some type of
9034900	9040620	Mystical sage who can handle business the most that I can do is pay it forward
9040620	9045780	You know sac anime thing was there was some creeper taking upskirt shots. Oh gross
9046820	9052460	Might be the best I can do is tag friends who are in the area and pay it forward
9052460	9056460	So are you you're being convention daddy looking out for everybody?
9056460	9058460	I
9059540	9065920	Honestly Rob, I've been conned daddy for about the last ten years more or less I have gone to many
9066860	9070000	Con raves and met up with my female friends
9070000	9074720	Which is her who asked me to walk them back to their rooms because they're guys at the rave
9074860	9077180	Who don't know how to take a hint, you know
9077180	9081180	The unfortunate thing about that a-hole that's doing the upskirt pics and all that stuff
9081180	9085260	Is that that guy probably don't even watch anime and isn't even a nerd in the slightest sort
9085260	9087500	I mean it might be but unfortunately
9087500	9092060	I think there's just there's just gross people that make their way into because they see opportunity
9092420	9097780	And it's it's gross and I'm glad that we're coming together as a society to you know
9097780	9101480	Put a stop to that shit and you know, we're looking out for each other and you know
9101480	9106260	Hopefully if a girl catches him doing that they're gonna fucking speak the fuck up and get that guy
9106260	9110820	Booted the fuck out in his phone thrown on the ground and stomped on or whatever. He's using to take the pictures
9110820	9113840	And you're absolutely right you read if you go back
9114900	9118660	The me to move movement remember sure. Well, how can you forget?
9118900	9119780	Yeah
9119780	9127020	It really exploded in the cosplay community because there are a lot of fucking creepers out there who don't know how to say
9127020	9131540	No, they do this and they do that and I think I've known people
9131540	9137100	I've been connected to people that I have disconnected myself from for their antics. We don't play that shit no more
9137740	9144020	Yeah, you know and if you if you see a cute girl at an anime convention dressed up in an outfit
9144020	9149260	Why don't you just ask polite or cute guy? Whatever it is. Why don't you just ask politely? Hi
9149260	9150900	Can I take your picture, you know?
9150900	9156340	Cuz a lot of cosplayers dress up so that they can get their picture taken, but just ask
9157940	9159940	But sometimes
9160420	9162420	We tend to read the body language
9163100	9165240	Assume this or that and fuck it up
9165240	9165580	Yeah
9165580	9171940	Don't never assume anything and and if somebody doesn't want to have their picture taken don't take it as they're a fucking bitch or whatever
9171940	9175800	It's just you know, I think we've all had this and I've experienced this
9176020	9177880	sometimes your days are so
9177880	9183860	Fucking long that when you've had it and some people use the analogy of I only have so many spoons for with the mental health
9183860	9185860	I can handle so you've probably heard this this story before
9186580	9192400	And sometimes people are out and they need a chance to drink their fucking Diet Coke and recharge and then they'll take the picture
