Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 713 for this January 7th, 2018, our first show of the new year since we had just done a show on New Year's Day.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Excuse me, New Year's Eve. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We are live at the Voice Geeks Network as we are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If you are listening to us live, thank you for choosing us over the Golden Globes for one because I don't, I don't understand.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Like the Golden Globes is what? Like the Hollywood Foreign Press is like 80 people. Who cares? Anyway, whatever.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And awesome games done quick.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, hey, you're back. Welcome. DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Wise from your grave.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes. Now, okay, if you're skipping us for awesome games done quick, that one I get.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But you can have it running quiet on the side while you listen to us.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We don't have a video stream. Oh, that's the new excuse I'm going to use for why we don't do video.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So you can watch other charity video streams. Well, who not? 2018, don't rule anything out. That's all I'm going to say.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So anyway, hi DarkSakura. I hope you're doing well.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm doing better.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I know you weren't able to join us on New Year's Eve, but I hope everything's all right.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, I'm not taking any coding right now, so I'm lucid.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And I'm not going to, a few people know what happened.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm just going to give a little bit of information because it's nobody's business.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But I did have surgery. I'm in recovery for a month. I'm recovering fine. I just get really tired.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, if you need to take a nap, you can go crawl in with Mr. Swoosh.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm currently reclined in this chair, so that might, you know.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hey, Jamie, what's next in the news tonight?

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
All right. Well, always here. Well, almost always here. I mean, he takes a week off now and then two, but he's here tonight.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hello, I'm here.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hey, Loki, how you doing?

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm fine.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Good. So we were having a little conversation as we usually do before the show.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We are a show about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, but gaming culture, it tends to bleed into other things too, right?

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So one of the random topics we were talking about before going live tonight while Bobby was wrapping up his show,

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
we were talking about movies that scared the hell out of us as a kid.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Now, keep in mind, we're all late thirties, early forties here.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, you know, we might come from a different generation than some of you listening, but I'm sure some of you know these movies.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So, so quickly, Loki, what was a movie that scared the hell out of you as a kid?

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Um, I would say probably, I know some like, I think it was American.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
American Tail? Was it the first one maybe? Like, I'm getting...

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh yeah, I remember the American Tail. Fievel, was that the little mouse's name?

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, I think it was the first American Tail.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It was Don Bluth.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, they made a ton of those movies.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Which, relating to games Don Bluth did, Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, he was a very prolific animator.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That wasn't that bad.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And Xanadu.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The one movie that I saw, I mean, that didn't really kind of creep me out, but like one that kind of stuck with me was The Gate, which was kind of...

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That movie was great.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't know that one.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It was terrible.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's the one where the kids open a portal to hell in their backyard using a heavy metal album.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What?

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And one of the kids gets like an eyeball in his hand and has to stab it out and everything.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah, that's the scene that I remember.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't, I have no, oh my god, was it rated R? I wasn't allowed to watch it.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And they had like the portal inside their house and had like the balcony around.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, they have like little like gremlin troll things that are popping out.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
See, I wasn't allowed to watch R.E. movies growing up.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I did that at a friend's house, of course, and then when their parents were home.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
My mom wouldn't let me watch gremlins. She thought it was too scary.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I saw gremlins in the theater.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh my god. I hear that movie fucked up a lot of people.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Eleven. I think I was eleven. Ten or eleven. Yeah.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Gremlins was great. You know, the thing is, is that like not movies weren't very scary to me.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There were only two movies that actually gave me nightmares after.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And one of them was The Thing.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But that movie, I can't even watch it as an adult.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The John Carpenter.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh yeah.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah. And the other one is, believe it or not, it doesn't do it anymore.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But when I was a kid, Poltergeist 3.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
OK, they were just saying in chat, Tiger Claw said, what about Poltergeist?

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh, that's a good one.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The first Poltergeist was my favorite movie when it came out.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh my gosh.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
My sister.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I wasn't allowed to watch it.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
My sister and I used to use the car as the TV and she would be Carol Ann because she was blonde.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's awesome.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But no, I love I fucking love the first one. The second one was shit.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But the third one, because I had a mirror phobia.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Did they have a Poltergeist game on Atari 2600?

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't remember.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It would have been terrible.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It probably was.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Well, some of the movie games like Indiana Jones was really good.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But anyway, I went through a period of time where I actually had a minor mirror phobia.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Wow.

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah, it wasn't very big.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But after I saw the movie, because, you know, the thing was going through the mirror and everything, I was obsessed with all the special effects.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I loved it.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I loved it. Even knowing how they did everything.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It was I couldn't look in a mirror for about a week.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Other than that, there's only three scenes and something that's fucked me up.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And they all have to do with faces melting or faces doing weird things.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh, like in Indiana Jones.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
In Gremlins and Indiana Jones, you know, where Stripe melted.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Spoiler, Stripe melts.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Well, come on, that movie's how old?

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Kidding.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The face melting in Indiana Jones and Large Marge in Pee Wee.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, God.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Large Marge. You didn't even say that one before the show.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That movie.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh, my God.

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I love that scene.

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You know, that actress just passed away.

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Not even a couple weeks ago.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No, she did not melt.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
She was also because I.

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
OK, look.

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Till Large Marge sent you.

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You all know that I am married to a guy, so therefore I'm homosexual.

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
One of those.

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You know, I don't like to buy into all the gay stereotypes sometimes,

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
but, you know, I love me some Mommy Dearest.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And so Large Marge was also Helga in Mommy Dearest.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm not mad at you Helga.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm mad at the dirt.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
For anyone who saw that movie.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
All right.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You know, I'm going to quote Mommy Dearest.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Although you say Helga, now I think of Clay Fighter.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What about Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, yeah.

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, that movie.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah, the scene in that one did it.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's really just.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That game too.

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Shit.

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But I it's just the scenes will still kind of get me for the same reasons,

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
because I know that they're fake and terrible, but they'll still do it.

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Other than that, though, I mean, like.

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I've seen a lot of movies in the theater that I was technically too young to see.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You know, so I don't care.

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
OK, so here's mine.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So my uncle took me to see Kroll and that was awesome.

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
My mom did try to protect me from a lot of the scary stuff,

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
but we went to the movie theater and nobody in chat has said this yet.

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I can't believe this.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is for me.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is the king of all like movies that will fuck you up as a kid.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I saw in the theater taken by my mother to see Return to Oz.

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Fucking love it.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I love the first one.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Exactly right.

153
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Because you think, oh, right.

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's the it's the sequel to The Wizard of Oz.

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Although in reality, it's more complicated than that.

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Those books became public domain at some point or something.

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Disney got the rights.

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't know what happened.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So they they made because if you didn't know The Wizard of Oz,

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
like bomb wrote like what, like twenty three books.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And then there were, I think, some

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
pseudonym used his name as a non de plume.

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So so anyway, they took to two of the books and they kind of combined it.

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And they made Return to Oz, which if you didn't know,

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Dorothy was Fruza Balk, who later was in the craft.

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Right. So the whole thing starts with like her at a mental institution,

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
trying to escape, getting like electro shock therapy and like all these people

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
turning into stones.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And then the wicked queen has all the heads in the jars.

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Like that fucked me up.

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That movie, I think.

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
My God, that was by far like the scariest movie, I think.

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And that movie is only rated like PG.

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't think the movie that my son,

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
my youngest son loves Coraline.

176
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I love Coraline.

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I haven't seen it.

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's a pretty twisted movie, too.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Is it?

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's actually super faithful to the book, too.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And I really I love both the book and the movie.

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's like this demon that tries to lure children into this,

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
like other dimension to basically steal their soul.

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
When I when I was a kid, it is an animated movie,

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
but it was animated for adults.

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It was a movie called Rock and Rule.

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Rock and Rule Racing.

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I love that game.

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Rock and Rule.

190
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Rock and Rule.

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And it was like this future post-apocalyptic where basically rodents

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
became the dominant species, the humanoid rodents.

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And I'm trying to remember the soundtrack to it never got a full release,

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
but it was Iggy Pop, Deborah Harry.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The one who was the speaking voice of the main girl in that movie was also

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Sailor Jupiter in the U.S. Sailor Moon.

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But the movie was really kind of like on that odd edge of kind of glam had

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
like the bad guy was like a glam rock guy who is certainly supposed to emulate

199
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
David Bowie.

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Just evil.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But the movie, you know, was so it was beyond what I was supposed to have

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
been watching, but I fucking love that movie.

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Never had a U.S. release on any home media except for one limited VHS

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and a Canadian laserdisc.

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And then they released it on DVD when I was an adult.

206
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And guess who fucking bought it?

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Of course you did.

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I also bought a bootleg that was taped off of HBO.

209
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You know, not to shift the topic back to gaming a little bit.

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
No, that's OK.

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You talk about David Bowie inspiration, like David Bowie inspired so much

212
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and even still today.

213
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Like you look at Moira in Overwatch is the thing that comes to mind for me.

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They just introduced her a couple of months ago.

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
She's very David Bowie.

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I think one of her skins is like straight up Aladdin same.

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Like it's just it's pretty cool.

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Like you see Bowie's influence in movies and gaming and beyond.

219
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, Bowie was always very technically savvy to you.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
He had that computer game in ninety nine.

221
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You did it for Classic Game of the Week once.

222
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He was very technically savvy with all that stuff.

223
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But anyway, I'm digressing a bit.

224
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I do have to give one more statement about that.

225
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The other people who did music in that.

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It was Cheap Trick, Chris Stein, Deborah Harry, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and Earth Wind and Fire.

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's just like it's like a who's who of like awesome stars from that day.

228
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But oh my God, it was so good.

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
All right. Anyway, we do want to get into games.

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And in fact, being that it is the first show of the year,

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
we thought and Dark Soccer is back with us tonight.

232
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We thought, what better time to revisit the time capsule?

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Do you remember this from a few months ago?

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah. And some of you thought, boy, you guys are really dumb.

235
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Putting together a time capsule in the summer that you're going to open in six months.

236
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Like what's the suspense in that?

237
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Y'all gaming changes so fast.

238
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I mean, I don't know about you guys, but I've already talked about this before.

239
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
How like I'll go from one game to another so fast.

240
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Right. Like, you know, I might be playing Overwatch or something and then squirrel.

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You know, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 comes out and I go play that for a little bit.

242
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And then the next week, something else comes out.

243
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You know, there's that. And, you know, just the way technology moves and changes.

244
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Right. Like think about how far we've come in the year at this point last year.

245
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I think we had just had that Switch press conference that told us here is the Switch and this is what it is.

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And this is the launch date and all that. And before that, we knew very little.

247
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That was just one year ago.

248
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And how many rooftop parties has the Switch cost?

249
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Zero.

250
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, we don't know.

251
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Totally let down.

252
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
4K gaming, you know, was not something we had really a year ago.

253
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's still not really something we have now.

254
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Maybe for the highest NPCs. But come on, we do have Forza, you know, is that.

255
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We've got more games coming out. Xbox One X is a thing.

256
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So, I mean, gaming changes that fast. Technology shifts that fast.

257
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So it's a little bit tongue in cheek that we do this segment.

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But, you know, man, I don't know how many of you guys go back and listen to old Orange Lounge radios.

259
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But some of the shit that comes out of our mouths about predictions and things like that.

260
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And just, you know, if only we knew then what we knew now, it's crazy.

261
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
All right. So anyway, let's get to it.

262
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So a few months ago, we put away in this time capsule some I think some questions or some statements about what are we going to discover in 2018.

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And tonight we will be filling it back up.

264
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Not only with our comments, but some of yours in our chat as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

265
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So I think the best way to do this. So I'm going to take our Vader time capsule here and I'm going to open up his head.

266
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And I'm going to pull one thing out and then I'll pass it around.

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Each person can pull something out. This is only fun.

268
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh, my God. This thing is full.

269
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Maybe we are going to have a three hour show tonight.

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't remember.

271
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We're into this kind of quick.

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
All right. So somebody wrote this down.

273
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
This looks like Matt's handwriting.

274
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Skyrim remastered.

275
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh, I think these are the three games you like right now.

276
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Why do we have three games randomly written down?

277
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, here's the thing.

278
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You put Skyrim remastered until dawn rush of blood Skyrim remastered.

279
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So I think these are like the games we were playing over the summer.

280
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Top three games so far of the year.

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh, am I supposed to do that?

282
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Should we do that again?

283
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't.

284
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let's do that. But that's actually right where they are.

285
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There's only been like a week's worth of games.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
All right. I'm going to do two.

287
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I mean, our top three for the last year.

288
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Last year.

289
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We can do that. Sure.

290
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
All right.

291
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Cool.

292
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I have one less thing I have to think of.

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Label it as that.

294
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
All right.

295
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm going to open two.

296
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So this other one says, oh, I wrote this.

297
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Did any accessories go down in price yet?

298
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And that was signed Dungeon Buster and Rob.

299
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So he must have said something in chat.

300
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Did any accessories go down in price yet?

301
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I think he's talking about the Switch accessories.

302
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Because they were all expensive.

303
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Well, they discontinued a Microsoft accessory this week.

304
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Sort of. Sort of.

305
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We'll get into that later.

306
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Not going down in price.

307
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
No, the Switch accessory sure as hell didn't go down in price.

308
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's for sure.

309
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They're still releasing new colors and new schemes and all that stuff.

310
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So I don't know.

311
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Scheme is the right word for that.

312
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah, there you go.

313
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
All right. Pick a couple out of these here, Loki, and read them for us.

314
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
OK, let's see.

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
All right.

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's only got one piece.

317
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
One big piece.

318
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Somebody shoved a whole piece of paper in there.

319
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Is that Jamie?

320
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
This is mine.

321
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
All right, what'd you put?

322
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
OK, so this is what I put as, yep, it has my name on it.

323
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
OK.

324
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Of course it's mine.

325
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh, we did this back in March.

326
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I thought it was in June.

327
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh, I thought it was in the summer.

328
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No, March 5th.

329
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
OK, so it almost is here.

330
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
We dated it.

331
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
All right.

332
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
OK.

333
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I bet they delayed Super Mario Odyssey.

334
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So you were wrong on that.

335
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I bet the system is hacked already.

336
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You're actually kind of right on that.

337
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah.

338
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But, I mean, come on.

339
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That was a Captain Obvious thing to say.

340
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I bet their online service is shit.

341
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Well, I was wrong because it hasn't come out yet.

342
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah, I think that we need to do, like, our favorite three games of last year and then our predictions.

343
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Sure.

344
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah, so let's do it that way.

345
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
No less than two Wii U remakes announced at E3.

346
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Not at E3, but we got Bayonetta 2.

347
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Technically, yes.

348
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So technically there's Bayonetta.

349
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Do we get any other remake announcements at E3?

350
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There's been a lot of games that have been ported to the Switch.

351
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't think those are remakes necessarily, though.

352
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah, no.

353
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So you got one.

354
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You got one or two.

355
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And no F-Zero.

356
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Well, that was, again, Captain Obvious thing to make.

357
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
All right.

358
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Let's pass them on to Jamie.

359
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Let's make her do a few.

360
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's almost like you had all this pent up rage for no reason for Nintendo.

361
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I know.

362
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
All right.

363
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh, Pokken.

364
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Thank you, Act F.

365
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Thank you, Act F.

366
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Pokken was E3.

367
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh.

368
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Thank you, Act F.

369
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Pokken is Pokken 2.

370
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
This was me.

371
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Sort of.

372
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I guess these were the games I've been playing.

373
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay.

374
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So I said World of Warcraft Legion, which I've played through part of the year.

375
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But then you've since stopped.

376
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah.

377
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And now I'm playing it.

378
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Danganronpa 2.

379
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay.

380
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Which I still haven't finished.

381
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And Breath of the Wild.

382
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Okay.

383
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Which you're kind of still, you have the DLC, right?

384
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You and Dan have been kind of Pokken your way through that, right?

385
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah.

386
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So I started on my Switch version.

387
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Okay.

388
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So.

389
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And then there's a few in here.

390
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Okay.

391
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This one's Rob's.

392
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I guess it's what you're playing.

393
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Final Fantasy XIV.

394
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Overwatch with Alan.

395
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And overcome with feelings about Andromeda PS.

396
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Was the gay sex good?

397
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Unfortunately, no, it was not until they patched in the JAWS stuff, I guess.

398
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's when you finally got.

399
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So Rob, the answer is no, it wasn't very good.

400
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Okay.

401
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
There's only a few more left in here.

402
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I think there's three more in here, so we'll each pull one.

403
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
All right.

404
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This one says.

405
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
This is a huge list.

406
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
JD's initials are on this too.

407
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh, this might've come from chat.

408
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Okay.

409
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't even know what the hell.

410
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Was he here during the time that we were recording?

411
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I think this is from chat because there's a Dungeon Buster thing on here.

412
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh, okay.

413
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So I think this is Jamie's handwriting and she wrote six things here.

414
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Virtual Console, Jamie.

415
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Well, didn't happen.

416
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We'll put that on 2018's list.

417
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Augmented Reality, Jamie.

418
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Actually, there's been a lot of talk of it from Apple.

419
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah.

420
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
From the developer's conference.

421
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I mean, that's a really broad category.

422
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So, you know, did we get HoloLens?

423
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Not beyond the developer stuff.

424
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But, you know, Pokemon Go incorporated AR even further into what they're doing on the phones.

425
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So, you know, that's something.

426
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
JD put Mii support.

427
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
M-I-I support.

428
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Well, you sort of can use the Miis on the Switch.

429
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Your little avatars are Mii people.

430
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah.

431
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
All right.

432
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Let's see.

433
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Two months to Linux, said Jamie.

434
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh, that must have been about the Switch.

435
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Two months to Linux.

436
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Which I don't think has happened.

437
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
No, it has not happened.

438
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But they're getting close.

439
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Stream plus video clips.

440
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Jamie, again, I think that's about the Switch.

441
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Also hasn't happened.

442
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Well, no.

443
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Video clips did.

444
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So stream didn't.

445
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Video clips did.

446
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So half point there.

447
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But this is like whose line is it anyway?

448
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The points don't matter.

449
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And then Dungeon Buster said EA and Ubisoft still committed.

450
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, that's a good one.

451
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So are EA and Ubisoft still committed to the Switch?

452
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Well, I think Ubisoft's a big yes.

453
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Definitely, yes.

454
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Definitely.

455
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I mean, with Mario Rabbids was one of their big titles last year.

456
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
EA hasn't really done much other than their sports games, but we don't know for 2018 yet.

457
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I feel like EA's kind of being bullied into it, which is fine.

458
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh, something bad happening to EA.

459
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh, that's just terrible.

460
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
All right.

461
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I think there's only a couple left in here.

462
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So, Loki, you can grab one.

463
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
We have to be more specific this time.

464
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We're learning as we do this here at Orange Planet Radio.

465
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And you can join us and chat at live.vognetwork.com.

466
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I have no idea.

467
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You wrote this one.

468
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Me?

469
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I think.

470
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It says, did 45 get impeached?

471
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I don't know.

472
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
No, I probably wrote that too.

473
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Why do we put things forward about games?

474
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I have no idea.

475
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
No, he did not.

476
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
No, he did not.

477
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Damn shame.

478
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But there's a book out, I mean, for what it's worth.

479
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm not surprised at all.

480
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I have listened to half that book.

481
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's pretty good.

482
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I obtained it.

483
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
All right.

484
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
One more for Dark Soccer.

485
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
One more for Dark Soccer.

486
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yeah, there's a couple more in there.

487
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'll finish them up.

488
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
All right.

489
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What I'm going to do for us is I think we do one of our game prediction, our games that

490
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
we're playing, and then we take a few things from the chat room.

491
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, Bobby in chat says, you must have listened to the show this week.

492
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Bobby says, you put that one in at the very end as a secret to everyone.

493
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You showed it to Jamie and she laughed, but you wouldn't read it to chat.

494
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Oh, well, there you go.

495
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Surprise.

496
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Okay.

497
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Okay.

498
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I can't read your handwriting, Rob.

499
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
All right.

500
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Then I'll do this one.

501
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
All right.

502
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
My handwriting says, did they bundle one to switch in yet?

503
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No.

504
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
They didn't have to.

505
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And this one's also your.

506
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That didn't work out so well, did it?

507
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Well, they didn't.

508
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
GameStop did.

509
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Can we play virtual console online like they said on the website?

510
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Nope.

511
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Well, it seems headed that direction, but nope.

512
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
If by you mean virtual console, you mean illegally emulated games online, then yes, you can play

513
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
those online.

514
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
All right.

515
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, JD in chat said, yeah, and it went on sale

516
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
for a bunch for Black Friday, talking about one to switch.

517
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So that's something there.

518
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I literally forgot about one to switch until it was just brought up just now.

519
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
All right.

520
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So chatters over at live.vognetwork.com, what should we put in?

521
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So time capsule's empty right now.

522
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Okay.

523
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So what goes in the time capsule for this year?

524
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So we're supposed to put our top three games, right?

525
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Because I didn't even put that in there yet.

526
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah.

527
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So why don't you guys start.

528
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Well, okay.

529
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So my top three games for 2017 are Animal Crossing Pocket Camp, Danganronpa V3, and

530
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Mass Effect Andromeda.

531
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I really have nothing else.

532
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So.

533
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
All right.

534
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They're going in.

535
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Put it in there.

536
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
All right.

537
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And, and Loki, did you, did you even think of three games?

538
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I was kind of put on the spot.

539
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Don't do like a huge sheet of paper so we can get everything to fit.

540
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Oh, okay.

541
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
We'll all rip these apart.

542
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So that's fine.

543
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's fine.

544
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I've got more than three actually.

545
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So go for it.

546
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Um, just the completely obvious safe answer.

547
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The AAA gaming industry will continue to fuck up games using, we're doing our top three

548
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
games.

549
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Oh, well that's still a game because it's the industry fucking thing as well.

550
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And my top three games of this year.

551
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Um, Loki's like, I didn't understand the assignment.

552
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I wasn't listening.

553
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I was writing, um, top three games of this year.

554
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That's a tough one.

555
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Cause I didn't play much.

556
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Um, I would probably say, uh, South Park, um, the Fractured But Whole and then, uh,

557
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:51,000
still Skyrim remastered and um, gosh, I don't know.

558
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Like I really didn't play that much.

559
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Um, I have no idea.

560
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm just going to put two and the AAA industry fucking over everything as my game number

561
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
three.

562
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Well, that's a given captain obvious.

563
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
All right.

564
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm going to put in my list here and I kind of had to, sorry, I kind of had to do this

565
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
fast and I didn't really think analytically about this.

566
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Um, but I put number one, Super Mario Odyssey, that's a given.

567
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I put number two, Breath of the Wild and I went ahead and put number three, Final Fantasy

568
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
14, Stormblood.

569
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I mean, I know that's kind of obvious for me, but I really liked the story and the expansion.

570
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Like seriously, I know a lot of people haven't really enjoyed it, but the story and the expansion

571
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
is so good.

572
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I like better than some of the mainline Final Fantasy games.

573
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So that's just kind of what came to mind.

574
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And obviously a game I played an awful lot this year.

575
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So I'll go ahead and put that in there.

576
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Don't forget chatters.

577
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
We want your suggestions over at live.vognetwork.com.

578
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Uh, Bobby black will suggest put time to car is number three cause you've played it and

579
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
we have it.

580
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So that is true.

581
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I have accepted.

582
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's not really played label your thing.

583
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Didn't you Rob?

584
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yes, I did.

585
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Okay.

586
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I put 2017 top three.

587
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Okay.

588
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Okay.

589
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So let's start with some of these other slips here.

590
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Okay.

591
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So, um, I have to kind of rip this one up funny.

592
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
All right.

593
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Here's my prediction or one of my predictions.

594
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:23,300
2018 will Microsoft jealous of Nintendo's sales this holiday, Jack the switch concept,

595
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,680
but for PC as well, the Nvidia shield is already halfway there.

596
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
After all.

597
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
I wrote a lot on that.

598
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Sorry.

599
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,920
So at the end of the day, I'm asking will Microsoft jealous of the switches success,

600
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,480
Jack, the concept for themselves, the reason I think that will not to say that I couldn't

601
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,800
do that, but they have, wouldn't be the first time they've taken a good idea, but they have

602
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,720
a tablet device pretty much already with their surface tablets.

603
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
True.

604
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,000
So they'd probably try to push that as a gaming platform versus, you know, cause you can do

605
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,120
X-Box anywhere type stuff, but yeah, it would be nice if another company did that.

606
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,400
All right, Jamie, how about one for you?

607
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,000
I didn't do them as like questions.

608
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,640
I just did one more third party switch support like SNK, Konami, et cetera.

609
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,040
So will we see more switch third party support?

610
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Yeah.

611
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
I like that.

612
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,520
Because it's really not super heavy right now.

613
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,880
And we actually have some rumors tonight about Konami possibly stepping it up even more with

614
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
switch.

615
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,920
So number two, Konami learns from Capcom and listens to fans because, you know, Capcom

616
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,640
is doing Mega Man 11.

617
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
True.

618
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
So true.

619
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,880
And number three, I will continue to be very disappointed by the gaming industry as a whole.

620
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
All right.

621
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,880
Loki.

622
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:44,000
Aside from the one I already mentioned, I said the X-Box One X and PlayStation 4 Plus

623
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,840
don't sell well.

624
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,840
Okay.

625
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,840
That we'll see new...

626
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,440
Don't you think it's a little late for the PS4 Plus prediction?

627
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,840
Cause that was last year.

628
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Was it?

629
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
Yeah.

630
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,120
It's been, that's been out a while.

631
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
But it'll still continue not to sell well.

632
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,080
I don't know if it's even selling well.

633
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
I assume it's not because...

634
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
Why?

635
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,880
Well, I, I kind of think the Plus is just quietly taking the place as the default console,

636
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
but...

637
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
All right.

638
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
No, I mean, it's fine.

639
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,720
It's not like it's still didn't like, Oh, I got to have it because it's so amazing.

640
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,680
I said that new second gen VR headsets this year.

641
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,120
Okay.

642
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,480
And the bold prediction, but maybe safe prediction, no Final Fantasy 7 remake and no Kingdom Hearts

643
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
3 this year.

644
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,040
Oh, so both those games not happening in 2018.

645
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Not happening.

646
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
All right.

647
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
That's the prediction.

648
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Oh, sorry.

649
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,440
One last one.

650
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,640
Nintendo will stop production of the 3DS and 2DS.

651
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Okay.

652
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,160
Now those are some predictions, Loki.

653
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
I like those.

654
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
All right.

655
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,160
So chat room, message me one prediction.

656
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,600
I will take the top five and I will only take them via message, not said in the chat

657
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
room.

658
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
All right.

659
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Why is that?

660
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Because...

661
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
That would be a surprise.

662
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Because I want people to fucking listen.

663
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
All right.

664
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,960
I still have more.

665
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,740
I had one more that I wanted to put in there.

666
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,880
The next prediction I said is, did Anthem flop?

667
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,200
You know that we've had a lot of things to say about how EA handled Mass Effect.

668
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,200
EA is further under the spotlight for this whole loot box thing.

669
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,640
You know they've planned for Anthem to have loot boxes in one way or another.

670
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,640
This game is already in development.

671
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,800
Why not put them all in one form so that we don't have a bunch of little papers in there?

672
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Because I didn't think of it.

673
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Yeah.

674
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:41,220
We need a project manager for the time capsule.

675
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,360
So I put, did Anthem flop?

676
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,240
Do I have to put my top three games on a piece of paper?

677
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
Or did you already do that?

678
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
One single piece of paper.

679
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
Yeah.

680
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
You can do it on one single piece of paper.

681
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
All right.

682
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
Stop sending me suggestions.

683
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
I have more than enough.

684
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
All right.

685
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,440
Now I do like this suggestion from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

686
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,440
This is before you started saying something, Jamie.

687
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,760
Bobby says, based on the games that you know are coming out in 2018, what do you think

688
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,920
your top three will be when you open the time capsule next year?

689
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:17,360
There's so many games they just don't announce until E3.

690
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
That's hard.

691
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
I can already name a few.

692
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
Okay.

693
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,760
Do you want to write them down and put at the top, um, were these my favorite games

694
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
2018?

695
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Question mark.

696
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,400
I'm out of paper, but yeah, sure.

697
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
I should hear it.

698
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
It's all good.

699
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
It's all good.

700
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Hey everybody.

701
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,060
I have to throw stuff away because you're terrible.

702
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,880
So what, what games are you going to put on there, Loki?

703
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,600
I'm going to put on the, well, we're going to get to it later.

704
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,640
A certain remake of a certain racing game from a certain criterion.

705
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
Um, fair enough.

706
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:57,920
I am going to put red dead redemption two and, and number three is gonna be tough.

707
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:03,440
I don't know, cause I don't know what other games are going to be coming out.

708
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,640
I'm going to hope for a new elder scrolls game.

709
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,640
That's never going to happen.

710
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,760
Um, I'm going to put Metroid prime four.

711
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,320
I think that's a gimme for me.

712
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,440
So Metroid prime four, did I enjoy in 2018?

713
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:23,080
Number two, I'm going to put, um, I think the Bayonetta remakes too easy because we

714
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,780
know how those games are.

715
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:34,000
So I'm going to, I'm going to be bold and say earth bound or no mother three because

716
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,160
who knows what that is going to happen.

717
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Ooh, I know.

718
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:43,440
Number three, I'm going to put secret of mana remaster.

719
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,040
Secret of mana is on steam right now.

720
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Yeah.

721
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,240
But you know, you know how they're doing that remaster.

722
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,640
I think it's only about a month away on PS4.

723
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,940
I'm really looking forward to that.

724
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,920
So I'm going to, uh, I think it's also on steam to be fair, but I know PS4 is the console

725
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:03,640
platform they're going with with that, uh, tiger claw and chat says sending me suggestions.

726
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,160
I've got plenty.

727
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,440
Tiger claw and chat says, what about F zero?

728
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,040
Do you think 2018 will be the year for a new F zero on the switch?

729
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
No, I do not.

730
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
Sadly.

731
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,700
And it pains me to say that, but no, I do not.

732
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,720
So that's why I'm not putting that in.

733
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,360
All right.

734
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
What else is left?

735
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,760
Jamie, do you want to read some of these chat things we're putting in?

736
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Not yet.

737
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,320
I know the, another game that I could be looking forward to next or this year, um, which I

738
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,400
hopefully it's going to be making its way out this year.

739
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,680
I know that they're working on Borderlands three.

740
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,280
There you go.

741
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,280
I'd be done with that.

742
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
There you go.

743
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
That's a good one for your list.

744
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,280
What about you guys in our chat over at live?

745
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,520
I think that we should leave.

746
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,160
I'm going to leave these five here.

747
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
A secret.

748
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
Oh, you're not even going to read them?

749
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Nope.

750
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,440
Where's the fun in that?

751
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,200
Because it's the fun.

752
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,920
That means we have to make it through another year.

753
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
All right.

754
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Did you put what chatters?

755
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Yes, I did.

756
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Okay.

757
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,920
All right.

758
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

759
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,600
Bobby says four is a horizon.

760
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,760
Four is most likely coming because they pretty much verified that the four is a series as

761
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,520
a yearly series splitting between motorsport and horizon in 2018 as a horizon year.

762
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
Well, that's good to know.

763
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,840
Um, that'll be really good on, that might be the game that finally pushes me to get

764
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
an Xbox one X.

765
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
We'll see.

766
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Um, tiger claw.

767
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,400
Except you can just play it on PC.

768
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,640
Yeah, I guess that's true.

769
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,840
Tiger claw in chat says in 2018, I want to see a new Ninja Turtles game from Rocksteady.

770
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,760
If Ninja Turtles is coming to injustice two, isn't the indication there's that.

771
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
All right.

772
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,080
Anything else for the time capsule?

773
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,400
Now that Jamie has put in the chat room comments.

774
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
All right.

775
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,320
Going once, going twice.

776
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,040
Do we need something that isn't related to gaming?

777
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,920
Oh yes, no, I do.

778
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,800
I want to put one thing that's very important and this actually ties into something we're

779
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,280
going to talk about next week.

780
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Okay.

781
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,440
Like maybe we should each put our one top secret social prediction.

782
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,240
No, I'll read this one out loud.

783
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
It's fine.

784
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,320
Well, mine's going to be top secret because it's my prerogative.

785
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,320
Okay.

786
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,760
I'm writing.

787
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,520
Did Rob finally rage quit ingress?

788
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:08,280
I reached quit for a while, remember as Rob takes me around to like a portal on the way

789
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
here.

790
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,280
Yeah.

791
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
Right.

792
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
It was pretty cool though.

793
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Jamie, when you take a detour.

794
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
All right.

795
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,280
True.

796
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,280
All right.

797
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
And I put mine on gaming one, which is still sort of gaming.

798
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,280
Ready?

799
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280
Player one didn't suck.

800
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,320
All right.

801
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
Anything else?

802
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Dark soccer.

803
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,320
You go.

804
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,320
Oh, you're keeping it a secret.

805
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,320
Yeah.

806
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,880
And then we'll seal it up.

807
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
Where's the lid?

808
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Where's the lid?

809
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
Oh, here.

810
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
Here it is.

811
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Seal it a little way.

812
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,000
Bury it underground where Mr. Smoosh won't find it.

813
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And there it is.

814
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,800
All right.

815
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,320
Going to chat over at livetopvognetwork.com.

816
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,200
Azett just joined chat saying, no, he just sent me on an errand actually.

817
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
And that's, that's about ingress.

818
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,260
But I haven't rage quit yet.

819
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,160
Today was pretty good, but I've had my days where I'm like, this is, this is it.

820
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
I'm done.

821
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Yeah.

822
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
I pulled it up this near this afternoon.

823
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
I was like, Oh, Hey.

824
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Yeah.

825
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,560
We had a little James Bond day today.

826
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
It was fun.

827
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
All right.

828
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,020
Seal it up.

829
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,880
By the way, next week is going to be a very ingress heavy show because if you've never

830
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,280
played the game, that's okay.

831
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:23,040
Because we're going to have some very fun ladies who really do a lot with the game and

832
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,160
the community here in Sacramento are going to be here on the show next week.

833
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,960
So it's kind of a, it's kind of a lady gamer takeover next week.

834
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
It's going to be a lot of fun.

835
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
Hell yeah.

836
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,160
So tune in for that live.

837
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
And Estrafest.

838
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Oh boy.

839
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
All right.

840
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,160
All right.

841
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,280
Oh girl, as the case may be.

842
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:43,800
Anyway, uh, let's, I'm looking to chat over at live.vognetwork.com just for a couple more

843
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,800
here.

844
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:51,360
Uh, Tiger Caw in chat says in 2018, uh, solo, a star Wars story was the best star Wars movie

845
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
ever.

846
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
That movie is going to be shit.

847
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
I don't know.

848
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
Let's see.

849
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,480
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, I hope my 4k home theater I'm building is everything I want

850
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,320
it to be and more had the builder here two days ago taking measurements.

851
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
We'll see.

852
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
We'll see.

853
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
All right.

854
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,100
The time capsule is locked away and we will open that up new year's next year, which means

855
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,820
we basically committed to another year of OLR.

856
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,280
So there you go.

857
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
All right.

858
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,440
Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this

859
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,440
week.

860
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
No predictions here.

861
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
Just facts.

862
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,920
I actually want to bring up something else real quick before you get to your gaming weeks,

863
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
right?

864
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,280
Um, well, not to be a big downer, um, although I've been all over my social media with it,

865
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:39,000
but my, um, my stepdad who I actually like better than my real dad, um, died on Christmas

866
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,600
Eve complications to a idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

867
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,320
It means that your lungs filled with fibrous tissue and you can't breathe.

868
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:53,600
And he was in Gainesville for his double lung transplant and died after the first day of

869
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
testing.

870
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,000
And so my mother has no job.

871
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,400
Um, she has no income right now.

872
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,060
She can't collect anything until she turned 60, which is 11 months away.

873
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:12,620
So I've started a GoFundMe to try to help raise money for my mother to help her keep

874
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,860
her head above water.

875
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,740
You know, I've got, we've so far raised enough to give her a month of her rent.

876
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,340
I would like to at least cover three months of rent for her.

877
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,140
Um, and it's not just me saying, oh, everyone else give money.

878
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:31,420
I've actually taken over about two or three of my mother's bills so that she at least

879
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:37,500
can have, you know, her phone and her internet and basic, you know, pay for her car.

880
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
I understand.

881
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,780
This is you looking out for a parent in any way you possibly can.

882
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,220
Like I don't think anybody can blame me for that.

883
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,980
And so I'm even going to go out on a limb and I'm going to do something that's a lot

884
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,940
of pride swallowing here.

885
00:35:51,940 --> 00:36:02,660
If I can either get one person to donate $500 or two people to do $250 or five people to

886
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,660
do $100.

887
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:10,940
And you have to say in the comment when you donate that it's for halo.

888
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:17,020
This means that if I get that goal reached, I will do halo as classic game of the week.

889
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,380
I'm completely said that during the time capsule thing.

890
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,380
Dang it.

891
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,820
Oh, did, did she finally do halo?

892
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,820
Yeah.

893
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,060
I will do halo as classic game of the week.

894
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:32,860
And on top of that, I will talk at length about halo and halo.

895
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,860
Go for gold.

896
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,300
Yeah, I'll play halo that night.

897
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,300
Awesome.

898
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,180
But I'll have to do it over here cause I have the halo.

899
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,260
We'll have to fudge it a little bit.

900
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,140
I have the halo collection on Xbox one.

901
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:47,820
I who have never played halo will play halo on stream.

902
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,260
All right, good.

903
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:57,100
And also I am planning on doing a marathon as soon as I've healed up a little bit more

904
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,180
and I'm not going to do it during awesome games done quick because that's unfair to

905
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,380
me and them.

906
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,900
But I want to do a stream where basically you donate 20 bucks, you pick the game out

907
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,300
of my collection that I play.

908
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,020
Which unfortunately halo is not in the collection.

909
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,020
So it does have to be something.

910
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,660
It's in the collection, but I'm going to do like per system.

911
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,660
Okay.

912
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:21,100
Like, you know, you, if you want me to switch systems, then you know, a little bit more

913
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,100
of a donation.

914
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,420
I'm just saying no cheating on the halo thing.

915
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,140
No, no, but, um, but that means I have to get the thing hooked up to the CRT so that

916
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,020
I don't have weird lag playing the guardian legend or something.

917
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,020
All right.

918
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:36,140
You know, and hey, if you want to donate more for a game I loathe, then fuck.

919
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,140
All right.

920
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,780
50 bucks for Zelda 2.

921
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,740
You have somebody in chat saying right now I'm in for a hundred.

922
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,740
Where's the link?

923
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,740
All right.

924
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,540
So the link is one down four to go.

925
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,740
I'm going to post it in chat.

926
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,740
Oh boy.

927
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,020
I think she's going to have to do it.

928
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:55,260
But what I'm doing right now is I'm even, let me actually get the link first cause um,

929
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,260
but then I'm also going to put it on my Twitter, which is at dark Sakura.

930
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260
Okay.

931
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,900
Um, but I will say it aloud.

932
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:11,740
It's gofundme.com slash Michael dash mom is the link and I will put it in chat right

933
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,740
now.

934
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,500
And that's M I C H A E L cause I know there's a million different spellings of Michael out

935
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,740
there.

936
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,620
And oh, I definitely got it.

937
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:25,500
But um, but just in the comments, you know, keep track cause you have friends and family

938
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,500
and non OLR.

939
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,020
But I would appreciate you leaving a word of encouragement to my mother cause she, it's

940
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:37,300
two weeks today that Michael died and she's really in a lot of pain there by herself.

941
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,120
She's had to go through all of this stuff cause he was a pack rat and she was even saying

942
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,500
that she was putting stuff away and thinking, Michael's going to be pissed when he gets

943
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,540
home.

944
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,780
And then, you know, cause he's been in the hospital so much.

945
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:56,300
So um, but even if you just want to give like five bucks or 10 or you know, whatever, every

946
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,100
little bit is going to help.

947
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,180
And if we can get my mom at least three months of rent, that should be enough time for her

948
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,180
to find some work.

949
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,180
All right.

950
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,180
Well, good luck to you in that.

951
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,180
Thank you.

952
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,260
I know it's, I know that asking them for money is not always the most pleasant thing to do,

953
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,740
but I think, you know, again, you are looking out for a parent and I think a lot of people

954
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,140
in your situation would do the exact same thing.

955
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:16,420
And on top of that, she's 3000 miles away, so there's not much I can do other than this.

956
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,420
Right.

957
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,420
Okay.

958
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,380
So, um, but my mom, I told my mom I was going to do this and she, you know, she even said,

959
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,860
thank y'all in advance for whatever you do.

960
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,860
Yeah.

961
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,860
That's my mom.

962
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,860
I mean, we can probably call my mother and say, Hey, you know, you want to say something

963
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,700
to everybody, but I'll ask her first.

964
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:39,540
But yeah, but thank you guys for, for everything that you're doing to help my mom out.

965
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,900
We, we argue about stuff.

966
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:46,220
We don't always see eye to eye, but she's my mama and she's a nice lady most of the

967
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,220
time.

968
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,220
So thank you guys.

969
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,220
All right.

970
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,980
Well, let's shift gears a little bit and talk about your gaming week.

971
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,260
Do you want me to have you go first?

972
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,740
Do you want me to kick it to Loki so you can?

973
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,660
I can go first and I'll put that, I'll let everyone know when I posted on Twitter.

974
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:07,660
Um, but I'll be honest, I've been in a lot of pain, so I didn't really play a whole lot,

975
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,700
but um, I did play some Dragon Age Inquisition just because it's kind of like, it's kind

976
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,060
of comfort food for me is playing Dragon Age.

977
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,060
Sure.

978
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:23,980
And, um, yeah, and a little bit of Danganronpa V3, although I, I lost my progress.

979
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:32,100
Um, holy shit, Raginator, if I can get to $2,500 during the Halo segment, I will say

980
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,540
that Halo is my, I'll lie.

981
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,540
Sure.

982
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,540
2,500 bucks.

983
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,420
I'll say that Halo is my favorite game and it's the greatest game ever.

984
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,780
How much to sell her soul, $2,500.

985
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,100
And then I'll also say it's a fucking lie, but I'm saying it for money.

986
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,100
All right.

987
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,700
Anyway, let's, let's get back to games.

988
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,700
Yeah.

989
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Yeah.

990
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,780
And also, but by the way, anyone who does donate something, I also will give you a personalized

991
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,860
thank you on my social media.

992
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,860
That's nice.

993
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:01,620
So, um, but yeah, so, um, we started Breath of the Wild together again on Switch.

994
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,340
Like starting, Oh, starting over with Switch.

995
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:08,620
And Dan also started the, the trial of the Master Sword and then was like, fuck this.

996
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,100
It is some bullshit, you know?

997
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:18,700
Um, so we've been, we've been getting our Switch gaming on cause mostly, and I mean

998
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:24,580
with the type of surgery I had, I have to lay out kinda, thank you already, by the way,

999
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,580
first donation came in.

1000
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:32,260
Um, but, uh, I, I have to lay kind of flat sometimes because of my, where I was operated

1001
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,160
on hurts a lot.

1002
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,500
And so, um, Dan will play, uh, play Zelda and I'll be his navigator.

1003
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,400
And so we'll do the puzzles together and things like that and look for things that we missed

1004
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,180
and try to find, you know, stuff that he didn't find on the Wii U version.

1005
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:53,700
And then, um, we've been watching a lot of, um, uh, what's his name from Game Sack, The

1006
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,740
Ginger Guy.

1007
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:01,180
Game Sack is one of my favorite, um, uh, video shows on YouTube right now, just for gaming

1008
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
really.

1009
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,800
In fact, I'd probably say that one and, um, Battle of the Ports are my two favorites right

1010
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,800
now.

1011
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,660
And I like, Did You Know Gaming and, uh, Beta64.

1012
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,660
Those are my big ones right now.

1013
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,660
Um, yeah, Dave, thank you.

1014
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:19,700
Um, but I've been watching, um, we've been watching some of his streams on, on YouTube,

1015
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,420
just the, the recorded streams and been pretty fun.

1016
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:29,740
And, um, you know, kind of got me thinking about going back and playing some other older

1017
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,740
games.

1018
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,100
I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing though.

1019
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,100
I'm almost level 52.

1020
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,380
You should go dig up the GameCube and play the OG Animal Crossing.

1021
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,220
I loaded that up on an emulator.

1022
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,220
Okay.

1023
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:43,060
Because I was going to do my little web comic using that and it's easier to screen cap in

1024
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,360
the emulator.

1025
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:49,520
But I could just do the, the double finger screen cap and I'll start a new game on Dan's

1026
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,760
DS cause he's not using it.

1027
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Okay.

1028
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:58,660
So, um, but yeah, it's, it's really, of course, Ingress today.

1029
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,660
Thank you, Rob.

1030
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,660
You're welcome.

1031
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,660
And a little bit of Miitomo.

1032
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:07,480
I'm kind of getting out of it now, but I like the outfits, excuse me, I've got hiccups.

1033
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,240
Um, I played something else.

1034
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,240
Oh yeah.

1035
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,560
And I'm, I'm actually buying Hollow Knight tonight.

1036
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:18,520
After having watched that speedrun, the game looks so fun and pretty that I think I need

1037
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,520
that game in my life.

1038
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,520
So, all right.

1039
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,520
There it is.

1040
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
Yeah.

1041
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,520
Derek Socrates gaming week.

1042
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,520
How about Loki?

1043
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,520
How was your gaming week?

1044
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,440
I finally got around to playing VR games.

1045
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
Awesome.

1046
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
VR game.

1047
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,440
I should say it's something.

1048
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,800
I played a super hot VR on the PlayStation VR and it's fun.

1049
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
I like it.

1050
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,560
The only issue I have with it, it's really just the PlayStation VR hardware, um, or I

1051
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,880
shouldn't even say it's a PlayStation VR hardware.

1052
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,960
It's more of the shitty ass PlayStation move controllers.

1053
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,560
Um, throwing things seem to be very difficult to get accurate.

1054
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:00,040
So like I try to throw, cause I know you can do it sometimes where you throw your gun from

1055
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,960
one scene to the next scene, because if you haven't played the game, um, once you kill

1056
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,340
all the, you know, the targets in the first part, it kind of teleports you to another

1057
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:13,780
section of the stage and sometimes you can throw your gun that you have from one section

1058
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:19,940
to the next section or like throw like a, you know, ball or ninja star or something

1059
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,460
like that down where you think a person's going to be and then you'll hit them.

1060
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:28,020
Um, so I tried doing that, but half the time when I went to throw something, it would just

1061
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,820
kind of, it'd be like, there's no energy behind it.

1062
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,880
I'd like, I'd throw it and it just kind of like falls down.

1063
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,300
Like there's just none of the momentum there and other times it would work fine.

1064
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,820
Or it worked fine in the completely wrong directions.

1065
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,260
I'd throw it and it bounced off of nothing and just somehow go behind me.

1066
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,060
I'm like, okay, that's not helpful at all.

1067
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,060
But I had a lot of fun with it.

1068
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,660
So I do like the game.

1069
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:56,060
Um, I just wish the hardware worked better, but it's fun.

1070
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,060
It's just hard.

1071
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,620
Definitely very hard to play that because you're trying to look around to see where

1072
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,620
things are.

1073
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,020
But anytime you move your head, that's when everything's moving in the timeline.

1074
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,460
It's super hot for those who haven't played it.

1075
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,160
And I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with it.

1076
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,160
Everything stands still.

1077
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,880
If you're still, as soon as you move or do any action, everything in the time starts

1078
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,880
moving.

1079
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,880
So concept.

1080
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,880
Yeah.

1081
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,880
It's a neat concept.

1082
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,920
So playing that in VR, you know, trying to get, you know, an idea of your surroundings,

1083
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,300
you're moving your head and there's like things coming up on you and you fire a gun and everything's

1084
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,300
moving, you know, for a little bit.

1085
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:36,160
And so it's just, it's difficult in a fun way, I guess I kept trying to make sure it

1086
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,160
wasn't hitting my TV.

1087
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,800
But yeah, so I'm going to definitely dive into more VR stuff, but I was, you know, happy

1088
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,480
to get to do that.

1089
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,280
Play another game, which I unfortunately can't really give an impression on till later on.

1090
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,980
So we'll just say it was hard.

1091
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,320
And then I played just the usual cell phone stuff.

1092
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,380
I've been playing a little bit of Ingress, a little bit of Pokemon Go, just kind of wherever

1093
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:03,640
I'm at, you know, if it's a restaurant or, you know, the grocery store or something like

1094
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,640
that, just hitting whatever's nearby.

1095
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,600
That's about it.

1096
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,600
Cool.

1097
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:14,400
My gaming week, I have been playing World of Warcraft Legion still.

1098
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,840
That's kind of my zen game right now, which is weird because I'm not very social in that

1099
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,840
game.

1100
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,280
I'm not really playing with anybody that I know, I kind of as a loner, I mean, some rando

1101
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,480
guild picked me up and whatever, I just, I don't really do anything but steal the perks.

1102
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,460
I leveled a druid on Horde side from one to 110 in the past couple of weeks.

1103
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,540
And I've just been exploring some of the newer content they put in there, like the Argus

1104
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,020
stuff and, you know, trying to catch up.

1105
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,560
So it's kind of been interesting.

1106
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:46,140
And then I started a shaman on Alliance side because I'd never played a shaman.

1107
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,900
And I think my shaman is already up to level 38.

1108
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,220
So you know, it's been just kind of like my zen game lately, kind of been playing that.

1109
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,620
I did some streaming this weekend.

1110
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:59,100
I played Super Mario World and that was a really fun stream because I got really frustrated.

1111
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:03,780
My muscle memory kicked in in the weirdest places and I remembered how to get to the

1112
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,940
star world.

1113
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:10,380
And then with a little help from chat, I think I got to the cool world, special world where

1114
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,500
all the stages are named like cool, awesome, and whatever.

1115
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,180
And one of those stages like tubular or something like fucked me up, like it took me a long

1116
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,360
time to get through it.

1117
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,980
And so it was interesting because one of the chatters was like, this is the hardest stage.

1118
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,860
And I beat it on like the second try, but then another stage just like ended me.

1119
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,020
It was so, so awful, but it was a great, it was a great stream.

1120
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,740
So I should probably finish that on stream at some point.

1121
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,460
So that was fun.

1122
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,540
And then I don't know if this is the game you were thinking of Loki, but I actually

1123
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,940
asked the author if I could talk about it a little bit.

1124
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,040
And the answer is yes.

1125
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:48,060
So I played a little bit of, and we've talked about it on the show before, YYR is making

1126
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:51,140
a new game and it's called super multitasking.

1127
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,460
Now he's beta testing this game right now.

1128
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,940
So he has invited some people to beta test it, which I'm assuming Loki's one of them.

1129
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,940
And I'm one of them as well.

1130
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,500
We just can't, we can't stream it until it's all ready to go.

1131
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:06,380
Um, but he said we can talk about it a little bit and I, I, I'm telling you, there's a reason

1132
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:11,820
why I brought him onto the phone to yell at him and tell him to put this game out because

1133
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,340
it's, it's fun.

1134
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:19,840
Like it's, it's incredibly hard, but it's, I did not realize like how, and for, if you

1135
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,060
don't know what super multitasking is, it's basically the easiest way I can explain it.

1136
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:28,460
Imagine you're playing WarioWare four places at once.

1137
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:33,180
It's kind of what it is, kind, I'm oversimplifying it to tell you what it is, but it is the best

1138
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,180
way I could say.

1139
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,140
So you're playing like WarioWare four places at once.

1140
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:41,820
So like the average game, honestly, if I get to two minutes, I've done a great job.

1141
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:47,020
Like honestly, I was not, I was a little surprised at how fast the games go by, but that's actually

1142
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:51,780
kind of a good thing because I do this whole one more, one more hit, one more sec, come

1143
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,300
on, one more.

1144
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,460
And so like I ended up playing it for a good hour the other day, just trying to keep beat

1145
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,680
my score over and over.

1146
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,340
So I, I, I think YYR is onto a good thing here.

1147
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,340
Yeah.

1148
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,580
So I'm excited for him to release the game.

1149
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,620
So he did say he's looking for more people.

1150
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:11,540
If you want to hit him up on Twitter, YYR, is it YYR underscore or underscore YYR?

1151
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,540
I think it's YYR underscore.

1152
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,140
And you can also visit his website at yyrgames.com.

1153
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:23,260
So yeah, so super multi asking, I mean, what I played is mostly finished.

1154
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,300
There are some bugs, but he kind of like already knows about them.

1155
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,340
So, um, you know, he'll squash them and I'm sure the game will be out in a couple of months.

1156
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,340
So that's going to be exciting.

1157
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,160
Y'all got to support him when he puts that out because I'm really excited for him.

1158
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,160
So thank you.

1159
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:41,060
JD in chat says a YYR underscore and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I'm mad he made it

1160
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:46,340
himself because I was going to make it myself and reap all that sweet, sweet indie game

1161
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,340
cash.

1162
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,380
So there you go.

1163
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,500
So just an update.

1164
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,820
Thank you to people who donated, although I forgot to mention, I need your Twitter handles

1165
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,260
to give you the thank you.

1166
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:03,660
But my mother, she says, please don't call them too emotional, but she says, please thank

1167
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,660
them for me.

1168
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,900
She's overwhelmed.

1169
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,900
That's wonderful.

1170
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,900
So thank you everybody.

1171
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,900
Thanks everybody.

1172
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,900
Who's able to help.

1173
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,900
All right.

1174
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:15,300
Tiger Han chat says you think we would see super multitasking in an AGD queue someday.

1175
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,600
Imagine a speed run.

1176
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,700
I think there's a speed run mode in there.

1177
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,260
I don't know if it's something that can be speed run because that's kind of the point

1178
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:29,260
is how long can you go, but I think it would be a great tournament game and he did build

1179
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,220
a lot of that feature into it.

1180
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,580
So I'm really excited for YYR.

1181
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,380
Like I really hope this does good for him.

1182
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:42,780
I think the one thing he might hear when the game gets released is that there's not enough

1183
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:47,800
of the mini games because people are going to come from this place of WarioWare and so

1184
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,040
forth where they're used to like 120 games and all this stuff.

1185
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,920
But like considering YYR has basically done this himself, as far as I know, like I'm really

1186
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,720
impressed with what he does.

1187
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,800
And also I think it's worth pointing out that if there were that big of a variety, this

1188
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,520
game's already fucking hard.

1189
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:08,400
Like if there was even greater variety, I don't know that it would be doable.

1190
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,800
So we'll see.

1191
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,800
We'll see.

1192
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,160
But I mean, I think, I don't know what he's going to end up ultimately charging for it,

1193
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,640
but knowing him, he's, he's not going to overcharge for it.

1194
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,680
And I think, I think it's going to do very well for him.

1195
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,000
I planned the minute I can stream it, we're streaming it.

1196
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,160
I was going to say, it's a great streaming game.

1197
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:33,320
Like seriously, like I know I'm overhyping this a bit, but like PUBG, Minecraft, Five

1198
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,440
Nights, that shit came out of nowhere and took off on streaming.

1199
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,440
People like watching frustrating games.

1200
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,440
Look at getting over it.

1201
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,760
How popular that is with streamers.

1202
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,160
I'm telling you, he has a chance.

1203
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,740
It may not happen for him, but it might with the super multitasking.

1204
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,740
So we'll see.

1205
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:48,740
It's just got it.

1206
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,680
The right people have to see it and the right people have to play it.

1207
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,220
And it's going to happen because I think you're right.

1208
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:58,580
People like to see people get frustrated and I'm not even streaming right now.

1209
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,100
And I missed the fucking pong ball or something.

1210
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,100
And I screamed at the monitor.

1211
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,220
I was so mad because like I knew it was coming and I got so mad.

1212
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,380
Well, I started like doing it like where it's two and two I can manage and also a third

1213
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,380
one pops up.

1214
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,700
I'm like, I can't do this.

1215
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,700
That's too hard.

1216
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,700
All right.

1217
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:18,280
Jack Wolfenchat says he needs to add Twitch API stuff where the chat can throw in which

1218
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,280
mini games show up.

1219
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,820
Ooh, that's a really good, I mean, I think at this point he's too far along where he's

1220
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:27,300
not going to add anything major, but he'll, he's, you know, especially if people really

1221
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,420
take to the game, I think he's the type of guy that's going to be like, all right, what

1222
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:37,800
can I do for super duper multitasking or super multitasking turbo tournament edition, super

1223
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,900
third strike.

1224
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,900
So anyway.

1225
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:41,900
All right.

1226
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,900
Good luck to YYR.

1227
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,160
Nothing but great things about your game.

1228
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,360
And I'm really excited to stream it, even though I'm going to be screaming a lot.

1229
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,360
All right.

1230
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,440
Um, for everybody else, it will be on steam eventually.

1231
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,440
So keep an eye out.

1232
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,520
I think there's a, because it was greenlit.

1233
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,940
So I think there is a page already on steam where you can kind of follow it.

1234
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:02,320
So you can go over there and check that out and then you can just follow YYR on Twitter

1235
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,320
and all that stuff too.

1236
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,040
And they don't have to go through the greenlight process anymore anyways.

1237
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,040
So yeah.

1238
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,760
Um, Oh yeah.

1239
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,120
Bobby Lockwolf points out multitasking one was on Xbox live indie games.

1240
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,120
That's right.

1241
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,660
And he put it out just in time for the cutoff there.

1242
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,020
And that's why this is super multitasking.

1243
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,140
And I think he bumped it up from 12 games to 17 or something like that.

1244
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,720
So he has already added new stuff into it.

1245
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:28,000
So, but for many people, I mean, I think so many people miss the boat on the Xbox indie

1246
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,360
games, especially as it was already being sunsetted and on the way out the door.

1247
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,640
Anyway, I think this is going to be where most people find it.

1248
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,580
So, all right, let us move on.

1249
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,600
We need to get into some gaming news as well.

1250
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,620
I don't have a lot of announcements here for housekeeping because as far as I know, we

1251
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,220
have shows pretty much coming up through the next few weeks.

1252
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,140
I'll be gone for a weekend in March, but that's over two months away.

1253
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,500
So we'll, I'm going to drag con in May.

1254
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,500
Are you going to drag con?

1255
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,500
I'm going to drag con.

1256
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,500
Nice.

1257
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,500
I'm going to drag un-con again.

1258
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,540
Actually, I should give a shout out to magfest because I know a lot of our listeners were

1259
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,340
at magfest this weekend and I was, I was bummed.

1260
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:07,380
I mean, there was a lot of problems with the hotels and all that stuff this year, but it

1261
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:12,620
sounds like once people got to magfest this past weekend, everybody seemed to have a good

1262
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,460
time and a lot of the feedback I'm seeing is very positive.

1263
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,940
And I know there was some question marks with the whole fact the arcade game room was changing

1264
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:21,620
as many things, but it sounds like magfest went really well.

1265
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,420
So I was, I have to admit, I was a little jealous.

1266
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,700
I didn't make it out there this year.

1267
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,100
I mean, it is what it is.

1268
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,460
Y'all know why I couldn't be there this year.

1269
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:34,140
But I will hope that they work out some of their flaws so that I can come to magfest

1270
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,140
2019.

1271
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,100
I think that would be fantastic if that could be a thing.

1272
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:41,660
So yeah, just shout out to those of you that were magfest, I'm sorry I missed it this year.

1273
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,540
I was definitely sitting at home this weekend.

1274
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:47,660
Like, I would see Ziba or SSG100mad or some of the people I know, they're like posting

1275
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,900
pictures or whatever, and I just kind of do one of those, like, you know, not that I'm

1276
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:56,900
like mad, but I'm just like, oh, I should be there now and I'm not, you know, but it

1277
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:57,900
is what it is.

1278
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:03,940
I'll be at Dragun Con and I'll be at, what other cons am I going to be at this year?

1279
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,860
I'm trying to play.

1280
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,220
Hopefully they do a Gamer X this year.

1281
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,020
I'll definitely be in for that.

1282
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,140
And who knows what else?

1283
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,140
Stay tuned.

1284
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,140
All right.

1285
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,140
Let's get into some gaming news.

1286
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,140
Loki.

1287
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,140
All right.

1288
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,980
Um, so let's talk a little bit about the Nintendo Switch.

1289
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:25,180
So the Switch is the fastest home or selling home console in the US.

1290
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:30,180
So it's sold apparently 4.8 million years over 10 months.

1291
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:34,340
And this has already surpassed the mark that was set by the Switch, which sold 4 million

1292
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,820
units during that same timeframe.

1293
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,660
And I guess in December they announced that they had sold, uh, the 10 million units.

1294
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:47,780
So, or they were, um, in Nintendo announced that they were selling 10 million units worldwide.

1295
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:54,380
So 4.8 in the US and 10 million worldwide.

1296
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:58,420
So Loki, you know, I got to needle you on this a little bit because when, uh, it comes

1297
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:02,300
to being critical in Nintendo, you're usually, you know, one to speak up here on the show,

1298
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:06,260
although you also, to be fair, you give them props or props or do as well.

1299
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:11,700
I think you, you agree that Breath of the Wild is a fabulous game as is Mario Odyssey.

1300
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,460
I don't think anybody, nobody's going to try to tell you it's debating that.

1301
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:19,580
And I think a lot of our frustration when Nintendo comes from, Oh my God, there's these

1302
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:23,980
things that other people are already doing and they're not like, they're, they're online

1303
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,980
is so weird.

1304
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,020
And all this stuff is like, it's like that frustration of like, this could be better,

1305
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,020
but it's not.

1306
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,300
But here we are, Loki.

1307
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,140
Now these sales figures show doesn't matter.

1308
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,140
Like it doesn't matter.

1309
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,140
Yeah.

1310
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,140
What's up with that?

1311
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,020
How do you, how does this make you feel when you hear this?

1312
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,020
It's still disappointing though.

1313
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,060
Cause it really should matter.

1314
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,440
It's not that, you know, it doesn't matter.

1315
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:49,820
It's just, it's doing well regardless of they're online as well, but it could be doing even

1316
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:50,820
better.

1317
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,780
Well, just, there's no excuses at this point.

1318
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,260
I mean like how well does it are behind her?

1319
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:01,620
I got a needle a little further because does it show that maybe this stuff doesn't matter

1320
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,680
to a lot of people?

1321
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,860
Maybe online gaming doesn't matter to a lot of people, but it does though.

1322
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,860
It does.

1323
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:08,860
It does to me.

1324
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,340
No, it does.

1325
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,300
Because like Splatoon is a big game.

1326
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:17,740
So let's do two or like, you know, Mario Kart eight or when it comes out, smash brothers,

1327
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,100
if they're online is broken, that's going to hurt the game.

1328
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:26,060
But online is working for those games you mentioned now, but yeah, but like, where's

1329
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,960
the rest of the stuff that they promised?

1330
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:35,500
Like I get it that like, they're not great at online, but dude, come on, make an attempt.

1331
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,140
There's nothing.

1332
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,260
There's no online right now.

1333
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,700
There's no online service that they're, I mean, they have like the store and stuff,

1334
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,180
but it's like, it's even more bare bones than the last console.

1335
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:49,100
But Loki, I like, again, I'm not trying to be a Dick, but this story says it doesn't

1336
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,220
matter.

1337
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:55,840
It's sold more than any other system done.

1338
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,660
Because people wanted Mario games and they wanted all the games.

1339
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,660
What can I say?

1340
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:03,380
You know, if you put those on the other call, would you, would you agree, meet me halfway

1341
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:08,560
here and say that for the general populace out there, it Mario and Zelda is more important

1342
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,080
than online.

1343
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,120
Yes.

1344
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,580
For some people, Mario and Zelda is more important, but they're going to need to keep having those

1345
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:20,520
types of games because Mario and Zelda, they're going to get old after a while and you can

1346
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,080
only play Mario Odyssey so much.

1347
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,080
I mean, there's a lot of replayability there, but it's eventually you're going to hit the

1348
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,080
end of that game and it's like, well then what else do I play?

1349
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:34,160
So could there be, so maybe, and you know, maybe there is some method to the madness

1350
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:39,120
here where some of these features are like peeling back the layers of the onion.

1351
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,960
Like maybe this year, you know, the online, the full support with virtual console and

1352
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,140
all that, that's going to be the next layer we get.

1353
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,320
Or maybe finally freaking Netflix and all that other stuff.

1354
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:52,060
Although they did get Hulu, so that's already kind of starting a little bit, but maybe more

1355
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:57,540
of that, you know, and then it will peel back into, who knows, maybe a Switch deluxe, because

1356
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:02,900
you know, this is Nintendo, you know, this will not be the only version of Switch that

1357
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,740
there's going to be a Switch deluxe or a Switch 3D or so.

1358
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,740
I don't know.

1359
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,740
I'm making sure.

1360
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,660
There's just a lot of frustrating things with their design and like some of it's really

1361
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,860
good and some of it's really bad.

1362
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:16,900
Like the really good part, like this is the design of the console is pretty nice.

1363
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,260
The bad part, the storage on the console is pathetic.

1364
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,540
Go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1365
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:27,380
We have a couple of people, we have an anonymous chatter 287 saying online gaming doesn't matter

1366
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,380
to me.

1367
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,180
Bobby says online gaming doesn't matter to me either.

1368
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:35,400
287 also says I stopped at Diablo 3 when it needed online activation.

1369
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,300
You know, interesting that you bring that up though about Diablo 3, because it does

1370
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,860
kind of go, you know, a lot of people were really ticked off about that and Blizzard

1371
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,340
really had to scale that back.

1372
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:49,020
Now the PC version still needs online activation, but Blizzard did ultimately release the PlayStation

1373
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:55,740
3, 4, Xbox, you know, comparative versions that don't require any online.

1374
00:59:55,740 --> 01:00:00,100
And that's why people have like gold cheated the shit out of those games too, because they're

1375
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,900
not online and people can kind of do that easier.

1376
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:02,900
Who gives a shit?

1377
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,940
Who gives a shit if they gold cheat the shit out of the offline game?

1378
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:09,500
Yeah, if it's offline and they're in their own little island, let them do whatever the

1379
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,500
fuck they want.

1380
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,500
However they have fun with it.

1381
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,980
It's when you go in with other people and fuck up their games too, when they may not

1382
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:17,680
want that, they may want a pure quote unquote game.

1383
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,680
That's when it's an issue.

1384
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,920
But I get what you're saying.

1385
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:25,080
But the problem is though, is if we let them just keep getting away with their online being

1386
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:29,080
shitty, it's always going to be shitty and at some point it is going to matter.

1387
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,040
And that's, that's my problem is like, get with the times.

1388
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,080
All the other consoles are doing it just fine.

1389
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,800
Why can't you be up there with them?

1390
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,240
Fifth Dream in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Pokemon will sell so many switches.

1391
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,600
Well that's, that's true.

1392
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,440
I mean, they've got, we know Nintendo's got that coming this year when you ask, you know,

1393
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,200
what are the big games on the Switch this year?

1394
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,320
Maybe Metroid Prime.

1395
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:57,600
I mean, maybe this year, but we know Pokemon is probably the tentpole fall release.

1396
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,440
And so, and that's going to be huge for Nintendo.

1397
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:06,400
I mean, even, and I'm not, I'm not like, you know, Shane levels of Pokemon obsessed.

1398
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:11,800
Well Pokemon Go maybe, but, but you know, with Pokemon, uh, I'm so excited to check

1399
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,040
out the Switch one because I think being able to play it on the TV, I think it is going

1400
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,040
to make a difference.

1401
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,680
And sit on the couch and chill and, you know, hunt shinies or whatever.

1402
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:26,320
I don't, I don't like gaming on the 3DS a lot unless I am in a situation, you know,

1403
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:31,280
if I took more mass transit or I was in that situation where I would need that more often,

1404
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,920
I think I would, but I don't.

1405
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,680
So anyway, you got a portable console.

1406
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,240
I do because there's always, because then the games will come out for it.

1407
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,240
Like how else would I play Samus Returns?

1408
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,240
That's my only option right now.

1409
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,120
There's still, there are still a lot of good games that come out on 3DS.

1410
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,200
You're not talking about the Switch.

1411
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,200
Oh, what do you mean?

1412
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,440
Oh, of course I bought the Switch.

1413
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,240
Yeah, because it's, it's a portable console basically.

1414
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,720
Yeah, it's both.

1415
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,720
Yeah.

1416
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,680
I know Nintendo says most people are playing it in portable mode, but I'm playing it way

1417
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,120
more in TV mode.

1418
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:05,480
Although certainly I've had flights out back East, you know, and stuff this past couple,

1419
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:09,840
you know, months where I do take the Switch and I played, I played Mario Odyssey on the

1420
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,400
airplane not that long ago.

1421
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,480
So I mean, it happens.

1422
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:18,840
So anyway, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1423
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:22,160
Actdeft in chat says Pokemon and Smash will consolidate the Switch.

1424
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,440
You know, we never know.

1425
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:28,480
Bobby Blackwil says I'll probably get Dragon Quest 11 because of the dual view going back

1426
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,040
to the 3DS XL and you know why he likes it there.

1427
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:37,080
287 in chat says this Pokemon on the Switch might be the one that brings me back to Pokemon

1428
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,760
games since I bought the blue version ages ago.

1429
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,960
You know, and with all the Pokemon Go hype, you know, that brought a lot of people back

1430
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,340
to the series that haven't played it in a long time.

1431
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:53,120
And then, you know, just build on that now with the biggest system in America right now,

1432
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,760
according to these sales numbers, getting Pokemon.

1433
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,760
That's going to also be huge.

1434
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,760
Well, yeah.

1435
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,780
And especially if some of these, you know, console manufacturers like Microsoft and Sony

1436
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:06,240
don't put out like a really strong lineup for the fourth quarter, like throughout the

1437
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,240
year.

1438
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,640
I mean, granted, Sony does have a lot of things in the pipe, it's just when is that going

1439
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,520
to hit?

1440
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,520
And same with Microsoft though, Microsoft has a lot of stuff I know is out there, but

1441
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,840
like, I don't know when the hell any of that's coming out.

1442
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:23,680
Well, and again, that's why I'm really curious about is Microsoft potentially going to, or

1443
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:27,800
anybody, I mean, this could be Sony too, going to try to see what's going on here with Nintendo

1444
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:32,080
and they're just going to straight up, Jack, sorry guys, setting up something for the next

1445
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:38,960
story, is are they just going to straight up like Jack the idea?

1446
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,780
I think it's too early to straight up Jack the idea right now.

1447
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,320
And I don't think that they're going to do another Vito.

1448
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:51,400
I would like to see a portable console from one of them, but what would it do?

1449
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,720
I mean, when it comes to Sony, I think in a way they've lost my trust a little bit with

1450
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,900
portable consoles because they put them out and then they didn't support them.

1451
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:06,040
So I would really want to hear some type of commitment from Sony that they have a four

1452
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,360
year plan, a five year plan with their next portable.

1453
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,720
But the weird thing is I say all that yet I'm thinking in the back of my mind, but Japan,

1454
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,020
it's still thriving.

1455
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,900
So it's one of those things where it's like, if I'm going to trust Sony with another portable

1456
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:21,120
console, I want the commitment that they're going to stick with it and not abandon ship

1457
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:24,120
after two years.

1458
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,120
But I also understand that sales drive everything.

1459
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,840
Even Nintendo probably had to abandon.

1460
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,840
I want it to be awesome.

1461
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,820
And I don't want them to do stupid experimental shit.

1462
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:35,500
Like let's put a touch panel on the back of the fucking thing.

1463
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,500
Why?

1464
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,500
Why did you do that?

1465
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,500
That's dumb.

1466
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,140
All right, so we're going to move on here.

1467
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:44,300
Speaking of Nintendo, I have some Nintendo rumors.

1468
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:49,860
Look, I know not all you guys are into the rumor chat, but the way we envision this show

1469
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:53,980
is that we all are sitting at the dinner table after playing games at the arcade and there's

1470
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:57,580
always going to be inevitably somebody at the dinner table that says, hey, did you hear

1471
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:00,140
about that Nintendo is doing this?

1472
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:03,980
So girl, hold your wig because I got some news for you.

1473
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:04,980
Right.

1474
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:05,980
That's right.

1475
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:06,980
So let's get into a few rumors here.

1476
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:10,500
Uh, and you would think I would think I should play Adele's like rumor has it or something.

1477
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:13,060
It's like an intro to this, but I think that's a little too obvious.

1478
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:22,620
So I'm going to go a little more deep cut here and they remember Lindsay Lohan when

1479
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,620
she had a singing career.

1480
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,620
There you go.

1481
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,540
I remember when she was talented.

1482
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:27,540
That's Bobby Black Wolf right there.

1483
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,540
I'm sick of rumors starting.

1484
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:33,980
This is the Bobby Black Wolf Anthem sung by Lindsay Lohan.

1485
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:38,780
All right, let's get to some rumors that have come out this week about Nintendo.

1486
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:39,780
Okay.

1487
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:40,780
Here's the big one.

1488
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:46,060
There's a YouTube that showed up out there that was showing the supposed 5.0 firmware

1489
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:48,420
for the Nintendo switch.

1490
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,340
And uh, the, the video has since been removed.

1491
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:56,020
Uh, some folks, the evidence, I guess, whatever shows that this is fake, but it was floating

1492
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,020
around Twitter.

1493
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:00,060
However, one Twitter user made the case for why it's fake.

1494
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:04,020
Big red end and a tweet says the system update lead is leak is fake.

1495
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:09,240
The console has Mario Kart eight DX downloaded digitally, which takes up 6.8 gigs of space,

1496
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:13,780
but only two gigs of system memory has taken up less than 3.2 gigs of the SD card storage

1497
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:19,280
has taken up and only 0.9 gigabyte cloud of cloud storage is taken up.

1498
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:24,220
So in other words, the storage numbers gave it away basically that the video was a fake.

1499
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:30,620
I felt the video was a fan based on the merit of, I, I, it was really this for me.

1500
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:36,940
Did you see where like Hulu, crunchy roll, YouTube or whatever was Twitch was all like

1501
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:40,060
in one little folder or something like that?

1502
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:45,420
I just think that design is not what Nintendo is going to go with.

1503
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:46,660
I think it's as simple as that.

1504
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:49,660
I don't think they're going to consolidate on 3DS though.

1505
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:50,660
What's that?

1506
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:51,660
Don't they have folders on 3DS?

1507
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,660
They do, but they don't look like that.

1508
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:54,980
They don't look at all like that.

1509
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:59,980
And so I don't think the miniature icons thing doesn't work for me.

1510
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:02,240
That's not what Nintendo is going to do.

1511
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:06,600
Even if they go to folders, they're not going to show miniaturized versions of game artwork

1512
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,660
or things like that, because that would include Nintendo's own game artwork, which I think

1513
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,300
they want to show in a different light.

1514
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:16,100
That's really as simple as it is for me.

1515
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,740
So there you go.

1516
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:21,300
So everybody in here pretty much thinks that's a fake.

1517
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:27,980
And even those in chat, I think, are like, nah, I mean, Nintendo may do something with

1518
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:32,540
new firmware, but that's, you know, as sure as the sun is going to rise and fall every

1519
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,540
day.

1520
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:38,620
Anyway, let's talk about some other rumors and maybe these are more on the scale of,

1521
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,580
well, maybe this could happen, but I'll see what you guys think of this.

1522
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:46,020
Technically the sun stays stationary and the earth moves.

1523
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,020
Thank you for that bit of science, Dark Soccer.

1524
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,020
I appreciate it.

1525
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,020
All right.

1526
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,020
Fucking science.

1527
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:54,420
Let's talk about Bayonetta 3 and Metroid Prime 4.

1528
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,180
Well, we know those games are coming.

1529
01:07:56,180 --> 01:08:01,340
Nintendo's confirmed them both, but apparently Nintendo Norway's site says that these games

1530
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:06,100
are for this year, both Metroid Prime 4 and Bayonetta 3.

1531
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:09,420
That is a little bit more surprising, I think, in the Bayonetta 3 department, because we

1532
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,140
just found out that that exists.

1533
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:13,300
So what do you guys think?

1534
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,540
Bayonetta 3, could it actually happen this year?

1535
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:16,540
It's a placeholder.

1536
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:17,540
Yeah.

1537
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:18,540
You think it's more a placeholder?

1538
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:19,540
I think it's all placeholder.

1539
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:20,540
Apparently it's from Nintendo's site.

1540
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:25,220
Bayonetta 3, Metroid Prime 4, and Kirby Star Alleys, as well as many other games that we

1541
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,780
will reveal during the year.

1542
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:29,420
We're looking forward to 2018, ba-da-ba-da-ba.

1543
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:30,420
It's all placeholder.

1544
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:31,420
We'll see.

1545
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:32,420
I think it could happen, though.

1546
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:35,260
I don't see why Metroid Prime 4 isn't something for this year.

1547
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,980
We have an entire year.

1548
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:37,980
It could happen.

1549
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:38,980
Yeah, that's true.

1550
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:39,980
All right.

1551
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:42,140
Uh, moving on.

1552
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:44,700
One more thing, and this, oh, darn it.

1553
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:45,700
That was the same story.

1554
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,700
Uh-oh, that's bad.

1555
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:49,180
Did I put the same link twice in there?

1556
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:50,180
You must have.

1557
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:51,820
Son of a gun.

1558
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:54,980
All right, well, there was another one in there.

1559
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,800
Does anybody remember what the other Nintendo rumors were?

1560
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,100
Let's see if I can find it here real quick.

1561
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,100
I have one.

1562
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:04,780
Um, I'm quickly trying to find it here about, uh, oh, shucks.

1563
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:05,780
Oh, well.

1564
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:06,780
Go ahead, DarkSakura.

1565
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,780
What do you have for us?

1566
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:15,380
Well, there, um, is a, uh, a discussion that was set up, um, trying to actually find where

1567
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:20,060
the location was, um, that, um, there's, oh.

1568
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:28,420
The site is, uh, Ruisatera, and there is someone named John Harker, who, um, has had some pretty

1569
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:35,400
accurate predictions, um, came in with saying that there is a Nintendo Direct scheduled

1570
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:43,620
for the 11th, um, and that, um, they don't know, he doesn't know if the timing has changed,

1571
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:53,340
but, um, it also was, uh, confirmed by another poster named Emily, who said that SNK has

1572
01:09:53,340 --> 01:10:01,340
a Switch title also in development, and there was a discussion about these 18 Nintendo Switch

1573
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:05,340
titles that popped up on Amazon yesterday.

1574
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:06,660
Here's the thing, though.

1575
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,020
Nintendo's going to do a Direct eventually.

1576
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:13,300
That's how they put out their news, and we only know the news through, what, like, March

1577
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:14,300
or April.

1578
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:17,260
They've still got to date that Kirby game, which we know is going to be summer and stuff,

1579
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:20,980
so they're going to do a Direct, but don't hold them to the 11th, and even, even in this

1580
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:24,460
whole thing, what, the guy said the 11th, but the timing may have changed.

1581
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:27,260
I mean, that's, that's a...

1582
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:31,620
And an EA employee leaked something about there being a Direct this month, too.

1583
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:34,580
I'm sure there'll be a Direct this month, but just don't be disappointed if it's not

1584
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:35,580
the 11th.

1585
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:40,900
Yeah, so the thing, though, about the Mystery games is that if you type in, in parentheses,

1586
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:46,460
Switch title, not parentheses, but in quotes, Switch title in Amazon search, it comes up

1587
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:52,340
with Switch title 23, Switch title 24, with no name, and with price points on them.

1588
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,340
One of them listed is $99.

1589
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:54,340
It's probably a collector's...

1590
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,340
That's all place holder.

1591
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,740
It could be a collector's edition of something, too.

1592
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:00,460
Yeah, but that means that we're probably getting some announcements soon.

1593
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,460
I'm sure.

1594
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:02,460
Yeah.

1595
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:05,660
Maybe the $99 for the Kirby thing, and there's, like, a cute little plushy Kirby that comes

1596
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:09,060
with it, and you know Act Deft is already going to Amazon now to put in the pre-order.

1597
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,060
Maybe.

1598
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:11,620
All right.

1599
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:15,900
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Act Deft points out they always do a Direct

1600
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:16,900
in January.

1601
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:22,580
Yeah, but the cycle's a little off, because the Switch, I mean, that was a Direct, but

1602
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:23,580
it also wasn't.

1603
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,200
It was actually a press conference in Japan.

1604
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,700
They kind of did it direct style.

1605
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:27,700
Remember that?

1606
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,420
Because they had the people on stage doing that little snapping thing that was really

1607
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,420
cute.

1608
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,700
So they did that in January.

1609
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:38,640
But I mean, again, this whole fact that Nintendo is just up and done, whatever the fuck they

1610
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:45,440
feel like doing, they put out a console in March, and a lot of people at that time thought,

1611
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,240
well, that's weird that they're doing it outside the holiday period, but they did that with

1612
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,240
the 3DS too.

1613
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,940
They seem to be doing okay.

1614
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:56,560
So anyway, I found the other rumor thing that I was going to bring up, and this is actually

1615
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:01,540
kind of a, I think it's a big one, it has to do with Konami, which, you know, we used

1616
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:06,400
to love a lot, and then they've fallen out of favor, and now they're probably trying

1617
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,000
to come back and possibly through retro stuff.

1618
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,920
We know the Bomberman game probably did better than expected, and Konami, you know, for better

1619
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,360
or for worse, has been supporting that pretty well with follow-up content.

1620
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:24,640
Well, apparently, some of the WiiWare Rebirth games are looking to come back on the Switch.

1621
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,400
That was Gradius Rebirth, Castlevania the Adventure Rebirth, and Contra Rebirth.

1622
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,800
Did you ever check these out on the Wii?

1623
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,360
I played the Castlevania one.

1624
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,980
It was basically the Game Boy game, but then they kind of redid it in a Super Nintendo

1625
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:37,280
style and put it on the Wii.

1626
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:40,000
It sounds familiar, but I don't think I ever played them.

1627
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,760
And I don't think a lot of people did.

1628
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,800
You know, the WiiWare games kind of got flooded a little bit, and I'm not sure if everybody

1629
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:50,640
kind of knew this was out there, so it wouldn't surprise me if they get a second chance, and

1630
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:58,040
this is again one of those things where it's like, Konami could do this kinda easily, but

1631
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,080
I don't know.

1632
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,440
But anyway, we'll see what happens with that.

1633
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:08,160
So, I mean, again, that's just somebody on, and I don't know what criteria this guy even

1634
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:12,200
has rather than saying it's Konami rumor or whatever, but it would be kind of neat if

1635
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,200
that did happen.

1636
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,200
Yeah.

1637
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:18,000
I think we'd like to see Konami, you know, again, Konami's one of those companies where

1638
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,040
it's like, I do, I wanna root for them, but I wanna root for the old Konami, so maybe

1639
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,520
I wanna see Konami kinda go back to their roots and do a lot of the stuff that works

1640
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,000
for them and make some changes in how they run their business.

1641
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Yes.

1642
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,200
So, I mean, you know, I think that's about the nicest way I can put it.

1643
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:39,400
So all right, anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, uh, Konami?

1644
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,400
Never heard of them.

1645
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,400
I saw their name on a slot machine.

1646
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,400
Yes.

1647
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,400
Yes.

1648
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,760
Well, you know, that business will still, uh, will still do very well for them.

1649
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,760
All right.

1650
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,760
Loki, what do we have next?

1651
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,760
All right.

1652
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:54,320
So kind of, um, going into the whole CES thing, um, which is gonna be actually starting I

1653
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,320
think this week.

1654
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:59,760
CES, they're gonna be showing off, or at least teasing, that there's gonna be a new

1655
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:06,200
Vive shown off, um, that a second generation Vive with a higher resolution screen is gonna

1656
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,760
be something that you might see there.

1657
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:13,280
In fact, they have a little tease on Twitter saying, New Years, and it's all blurry, resolution,

1658
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:17,720
and then 1-8-18, and, um, yeah.

1659
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:22,560
So I guess we'll see tomorrow that there's gonna be a new Vive or something.

1660
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:29,560
Well, I mean, you know, if they do new phones every year, why not upgrade the tech in the

1661
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:30,560
VR every year?

1662
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,560
It makes sense.

1663
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,560
I'm waiting.

1664
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,880
I'm on the fence waiting for, I hope that the price is right, because I think the Vive's

1665
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,320
pretty expensive right now, but the tech's nice.

1666
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,580
Well, usually when new tech comes out, old tech gets cheaper.

1667
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:45,600
So would you maybe jump in on the old tech, knowing it would drop the price?

1668
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,400
I do want to jump in on something maybe this year.

1669
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:53,360
I have to see, like, the setup with the Vive and the whole room scale stuff is pretty large.

1670
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,920
I know that's, I think, a little bit more optional, but, like, I don't know.

1671
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:01,760
The Vive is, I mean, the reason why you have all that setup is that the accuracy is much

1672
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,520
better on the Vive than probably anything else.

1673
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,520
Yeah, I'm down with that.

1674
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:08,800
It's just, you know, yeah, it'd be kind of crazy to set that up in my living room.

1675
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,960
Yeah, you're just like, what the fuck are you doing?

1676
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,960
You're kids might take you to the...

1677
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:12,960
You're trying to watch TV.

1678
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,960
Why are you walking in front of the TV?

1679
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:14,960
That's true.

1680
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,440
I would have a problem with that here, too, because Mr. Smoosh would probably try to climb

1681
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,440
one of the poles.

1682
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,160
He's like punching people in the game and he's like, what are you doing?

1683
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,160
Can I play that?

1684
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:25,480
I'm like, you better step back because I don't want to hit you.

1685
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,360
Bobby Blackwolf making a new offer in chat.

1686
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,720
I'll sell Loki my old Vive if they have a new Vive.

1687
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,720
But I want the new Vive.

1688
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,160
There's a way to do it.

1689
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,000
That happens with phones sometimes, too.

1690
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,520
I'm getting the new one, so I'm selling my old one.

1691
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,520
Yeah.

1692
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,520
Yeah, there you go.

1693
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,560
All right.

1694
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,360
Let me talk about some New Year's messages from some of your favorite gaming companies,

1695
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:54,680
including Squeenix, Yosuke Matsuda talked in a message here, posted a letter this week

1696
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:59,360
that talked about, you know, I want to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and the content

1697
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:04,360
industry is going through all these different changes, including VR, AR, MR, and so forth.

1698
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:09,340
So they mentioned in here, specifically, he's calling out VR, AR, and MR, and what's interesting

1699
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:12,720
is that he actually brings up the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games because those games

1700
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,040
are happening, of course, in Tokyo this year.

1701
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:21,280
So Japan is trying to ramp up 5G infrastructure, so meaning there are more mobile networks

1702
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:25,740
that provide constant connectivity and support massive data traffic at a low cost.

1703
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:29,580
So kind of saying like, you know, what could this do for mobile gaming?

1704
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:34,120
These technological advancements could result in new forums for creating content and new

1705
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,120
business opportunities.

1706
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:40,800
And then he goes into talking about a richer lineup of digital content platforms, mentioning

1707
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,920
again smartphone shipments are in excess of 1.5 billion units.

1708
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:49,880
He mentions the Nintendo Switch, which he called a major global success, selling more

1709
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:54,720
than 10 million units worldwide, but then also called out the PlayStation 4 for selling

1710
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:59,560
70 million units, and then the Xbox One for adding the Xbox One to its lineup, and then

1711
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:02,360
didn't say anything about sales.

1712
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,720
I can't help but notice those things.

1713
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:08,280
I'm not trying to be rude to the Microsoft fans, it's just a little funny.

1714
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,280
All right.

1715
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,520
Anyway, so saying, you know, but he did say got off to a good start during the holiday

1716
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,520
season.

1717
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,920
So there's nothing else, you know, Square Enix still recognizes that and seems to be

1718
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:22,000
committed to those platforms, even if not necessarily in Japan.

1719
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,600
So while the consumer console game market has been solid in the West, it's struggling

1720
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:30,700
in Japan, but we expect the Japanese market to gain significant vitality as it joins the

1721
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,260
overall trend.

1722
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:36,440
So kind of interesting, you know, he's just talking about that it's been good in 2018,

1723
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:40,680
we're going to leverage the global acceleration of technological evolution as well as prevailing

1724
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:45,320
market trends in order to provide high quality, high creative contents, so that we can bring

1725
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:49,880
new amazement and fun to our customers the world over again, that's Yusuke Matsuda from

1726
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,240
Square Enix.

1727
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:54,200
So what do you guys think here and all that I mean, Square Enix really seems like they

1728
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,320
still they're gonna have their fingers in every pot.

1729
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:02,200
They're gonna do mobile, they're doing the switch, you can still expect Xbox Ones and

1730
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,440
PS4, you know, stuff.

1731
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,440
Same same.

1732
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,160
It sounds like Square's kind of committed to everything.

1733
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,760
Well, I'm excited about AR stuff.

1734
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:12,840
I mean, that's why I got the the Pixel 2 because that was one of the phones that does support

1735
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:17,120
some of that AR stuff, not that's a non-Apple phone.

1736
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:22,280
But I'm still waiting for something that's other than these AR stickers, which it's all

1737
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,280
right.

1738
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,880
It's just kind of still lame, so early.

1739
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,120
Well, on to a different 2018 message.

1740
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:34,280
This one was from Natsume, of course, the makers of Harvest Moon, which is adorable

1741
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,280
little series.

1742
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,720
This was a letter from Hiro Mikawa, who's the president and CEO of Natsume.

1743
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:43,000
And of course, it did focus on Harvest Moon because that's that company's kind of bread

1744
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
and butter.

1745
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,500
He starts by sharing a little bit of, you know, his memories with Harvest Moon, but

1746
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:51,360
also pointing out that, you know, in celebration of Harvest Moon's 20th anniversary, we've

1747
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,820
developed a new Harvest Moon title, Harvest Moon Light of Hope.

1748
01:18:54,820 --> 01:19:00,560
It's the first Harvest Moon to be multi-platform PC, Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation 4.

1749
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:04,820
The PC version was released in November, and the Switch and the PS4 are going to be released

1750
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:05,820
early this year.

1751
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:09,480
Then you just kind of continue to say thank you for the continued support.

1752
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:13,680
We have several other exciting titles coming this year, in addition to Harvest Moon Light

1753
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,980
of Hope for Switch and PS4, so stay tuned.

1754
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:21,140
And they are committed to, quote, make everyone happy.

1755
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:22,880
That's their corporate mission.

1756
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,980
Don't you just want to hug them?

1757
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:26,820
Natsume always had some of the cutest boosts at E3.

1758
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:29,020
That was the big inflatable cute cows and stuff.

1759
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:32,820
So you can't help but just pinch their little cheeks and go, you're so damn adorable.

1760
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:33,820
All right.

1761
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:36,580
Are you going to play some new Harvest Moon, Dark Sakura?

1762
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:38,760
I'm surprised that's a series you don't play anymore.

1763
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,760
I didn't like it.

1764
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,760
That was never my thing.

1765
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:41,760
Really?

1766
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,760
It was always, you know, whose thing.

1767
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,220
OK, fair enough.

1768
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,220
Let's see.

1769
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:50,220
287 in chat says, Natsume for the win.

1770
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:52,380
Fifth Dream in chat says Harvest Valley.

1771
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:53,380
All right.

1772
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:55,660
You going to check out Harvest Moon?

1773
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:56,900
I'm going to check it out on Switch.

1774
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:57,900
It might be cute.

1775
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,620
I want to see what it looks like.

1776
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:03,580
I still haven't played the other farming game.

1777
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:04,580
So many farming games.

1778
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:05,580
There's a lot of farming.

1779
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:07,820
It's Farmville Simulator and Farming Simulator.

1780
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:08,820
Yes.

1781
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:14,820
I need a cross between like Farming Simulator and like with the romance options of Mass

1782
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:17,660
Effect or any BioWare game.

1783
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:19,420
I think we need to do that.

1784
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,300
Call it barn life.

1785
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,300
I'm down with that.

1786
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,300
That's fine.

1787
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:27,220
You actually did have that in World of Warcraft in a quest.

1788
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:28,220
I do remember that.

1789
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:31,820
Well, they kind of and they really expanded on that in later expansions when you have

1790
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:35,380
like the garrison and now they kind of you don't really have the garrison anymore.

1791
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:40,180
The Mr. Garrison, you have the allies that you send out.

1792
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:44,380
It's kind of a similar thing, but it always makes me laugh to go back because that's always

1793
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:49,580
why I want to do my level there for Alliance is because I love that whole stupid quest

1794
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:50,580
line.

1795
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:51,580
I understand.

1796
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:55,260
I took a great picture of Mr. Smoosh, by the way, which wow is going to be changing pretty

1797
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:58,540
significantly in the coming weeks whenever that patch rolls out because the leveling

1798
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:00,900
is going to change completely.

1799
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:06,140
You will be able to level one to 60 in any zone in the old world because the level scaling

1800
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:09,460
that they do, you know how the level scaling in Legion, you can kind of go from a hundred

1801
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:12,000
to 110, like kind of however you want.

1802
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,500
They're doing that with old content.

1803
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:20,460
And then what's going to happen is 70 to 90, no, sorry, 60 to 80 is going to be, you can

1804
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:24,620
go to Northrend or you can go to Outland, pick which one you like more and stay there.

1805
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,940
I think that's when I'm going to re up.

1806
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:27,940
Yeah.

1807
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:28,940
And a lot of people are looking at that.

1808
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:33,780
Either that or I might just go ahead and do it while I'm recovering so I can get my, because

1809
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:39,940
I was already, I had just finished the Gul'dan raid, so it shouldn't take me too long to

1810
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:40,940
catch up.

1811
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:42,940
Well, let's move on.

1812
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:43,940
You have a new story for us.

1813
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:44,940
It has nothing to do with wow.

1814
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:48,900
It has everything to do with Kylo Ren's abs.

1815
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:54,580
So there's already a mod for Star Wars Battlefront II that lets you play as Matt, the radar technician.

1816
01:21:55,540 --> 01:22:01,140
Which if you don't know, Saturday Night Live did this thing where it was like the Undercover

1817
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:07,300
Bosses show or whatever it was, where he went incognito, where Kylo Ren went as Matt, the

1818
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:12,820
radar technician to see what the employees on the Starkiller base thought of him.

1819
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:17,100
And then, you know, he came out as, you know, oh, it's me.

1820
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,500
Oh, we knew it was you the whole time.

1821
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,940
Oh, great, whatever.

1822
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:26,460
So, but he had like these old like 80s style, you know, glasses and, you know, a bad blonde

1823
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:27,460
wig.

1824
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:32,140
So he is in Star Wars Battlefront II as a mod.

1825
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:38,020
So yeah, don't force choke employees in the break room.

1826
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:41,180
And also, if you haven't seen that sketch, watch it because it's fucking hilarious.

1827
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:42,180
Okay.

1828
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:43,180
It is great.

1829
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:46,940
It was, Saturday Night Live is getting a little bit of its groove back.

1830
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:47,940
A little bit.

1831
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:53,060
It's still as good as it was in the 90s or the 70s, but it's, you know, it's getting

1832
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:54,060
its groove back.

1833
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:58,740
It's not as bad as it was either because it was pretty bad there for a while.

1834
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:01,380
But that whole skit is amazing.

1835
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:02,860
It is pretty great.

1836
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:03,940
All right.

1837
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:06,700
So let's move on with Logie.

1838
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,220
All right.

1839
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:14,220
So you know, that game that everybody's into nowadays, that Star Wars Battlefront II, it's

1840
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:16,460
being updated quite a bit.

1841
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:18,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

1842
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,540
Not the Star Wars Battlefront II that's out now.

1843
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:22,660
But from 2005, actually.

1844
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:30,500
So the 2005 version, which is probably, I wouldn't say a better version, but the better

1845
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:33,180
version is being continually updated.

1846
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:36,500
There's actually a lot of people playing it still, and they've been doing some different

1847
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:42,060
patching optimizations, including improving the lobby functionality, adding Steam usernames

1848
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:44,620
that show up correctly now when you're playing.

1849
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:48,060
And then they had more accurate ping calculations, stuff like that.

1850
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:52,780
So if you're sick of Battlefront II and you want to play some better Battlefront II, you

1851
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:55,980
can do that because they have it available.

1852
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:58,260
The classic version, I think on Steam.

1853
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:04,100
Yeah, I think they do sell the old one on Steam.

1854
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:05,100
They do.

1855
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:11,020
So, you know, definitely worth checking out if you don't have it.

1856
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:12,740
And even if you do have it, you should just check it out.

1857
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:13,740
Ten dollars.

1858
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:22,100
Ten dollars for the non loot box filled garbage Battlefront II game.

1859
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:25,020
Can I do a quick aside real quick that's not related to gaming that's going to disgust

1860
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:27,460
all of you?

1861
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:33,220
So Alan and I celebrated eight years of dating this past week because we started dating January

1862
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:34,220
4th of 2010.

1863
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:37,380
I just want to point out, no, and it is related to what's going on right now because he just

1864
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,820
got back from his other Sunday night stuff he does.

1865
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,620
And he just brought me a Starbucks.

1866
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:43,100
Didn't even ask.

1867
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:46,900
And he knew that I'd already had a coffee before the show because he said, it's hot

1868
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:47,900
cocoa.

1869
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,540
It's not coffee.

1870
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:50,540
What a guy.

1871
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:54,820
So I just have to, I just have to do a little wah moment.

1872
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:56,820
He just yelled from the living room, barf.

1873
01:24:56,820 --> 01:25:00,980
Listen, this isn't River City Ransom.

1874
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:01,980
But it should be.

1875
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:04,060
River City Ransom is awesome.

1876
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:05,060
Oh my God.

1877
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:07,500
I'm just looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1878
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:12,340
I think the Ingress takeover is beginning because I see a Zet and Rockat are both in

1879
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:14,380
our chat right now chatting.

1880
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:15,380
That's awesome.

1881
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:16,380
Sup guys.

1882
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:21,380
Well, I think the only person I've spoken with is Rockat other than just seeing people

1883
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:24,740
in our group discussion.

1884
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:29,180
For those who don't know on Ingress, I go as Kurotsubasa, which is always the nickname

1885
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:32,060
I use when dark Sakura is not available.

1886
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,060
Fair enough.

1887
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:34,060
Yeah.

1888
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:35,060
Hot cocoa is good.

1889
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:36,060
All right.

1890
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:39,380
So we're going to move on to one more story before we get to the classic game of the week.

1891
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:43,020
But this kind of has to do with classic games a little bit.

1892
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:46,820
This has to do with a new game and it's a shooter game.

1893
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:51,980
Dark Sakura, you might be into this, a top-down shooter and it's a Sega Sega, but it's going

1894
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,820
to be on the mega drive, the Genesis and the Dreamcast.

1895
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:57,100
It is called Xeno crisis.

1896
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:03,180
They're trying to recreate the look and feel of classic Sega games to do this new.

1897
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:06,620
It's going to be new Sega Genesis cartridge and CD based releases.

1898
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:10,600
So Xena crisis, it's going to be a procedurally generated labyrinth.

1899
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:11,900
That means a roguelike.

1900
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:12,900
That's okay.

1901
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:13,900
Uh, of alien.

1902
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,540
It looks like, it looks like alien syndrome.

1903
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:16,540
Holy shit.

1904
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,740
Like, doesn't it just look like alien syndrome?

1905
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:19,940
Alien syndrome.

1906
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:23,780
It does to me a bit, except it doesn't have the big blobby things everywhere.

1907
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:30,140
Cause that was always what defined alien syndrome to me, but dude, this fuck me, I need this.

1908
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:33,980
Well, you can go to Kickstarter because that's where it is right now.

1909
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:38,660
They are looking at putting out the ROMs and cartridges in October, 2018 to try to be right

1910
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:42,420
alongside the 30th anniversary of the mega drives launch in Japan.

1911
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:44,660
You can check that out by searching Xeno crisis.

1912
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:48,260
That's Xena crisis, uh, over on yield Kickstarter.

1913
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:49,260
Good luck to those guys.

1914
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:53,260
10, 10 pounds for a 15 pounds for a downloadable ROM file.

1915
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:55,380
Yeah, not bad, right?

1916
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:56,380
Not bad at all.

1917
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:59,900
It's interesting that they're embracing that route too, where it's like Dreamcast

1918
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:00,900
file.

1919
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:02,780
Oh, so you can burn your own disc.

1920
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:03,780
Why not?

1921
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:04,780
Yeah.

1922
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:05,780
Yeah.

1923
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:13,460
25 pounds gets you, um, the mega drive ROM, the Dreamcast file and the OST might have

1924
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:14,460
to get in on that.

1925
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:18,460
But one of them says this is a switch download as well.

1926
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:19,460
All right.

1927
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:20,460
Anyway.

1928
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:21,460
Sorry to distract you, Jamie.

1929
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:26,100
We got to get to the classic game of the week, not halo talk about that earlier.

1930
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,580
That'll be later if you got, if y'all make it.

1931
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:31,860
But this week, dark soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that

1932
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:39,540
she thinks, Hey, you brats put down your new fangled breath of the wilds, your Mario odysseys

1933
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:45,980
and your, your pub G's or pug bees, whatever that thing is and play this game instead.

1934
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:46,980
Yeah.

1935
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:47,980
Classic game of the week.

1936
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:48,980
Dark soccer.

1937
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:50,740
What is the classic game of the week this week?

1938
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:58,220
Ray storm, which is a scrolling shooter, uh, that was developed by Taito.

1939
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:04,620
Um, it only came out in Japan and arcades in 1996 and later on there was a PlayStation

1940
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:11,260
port in 97 and the Sega Saturn version that came out as layer section two.

1941
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:17,940
Um, there were other releases of it that came, um, including versions and combinations, but

1942
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:24,460
I'll get to that in a moment because Ray storm is probably one of my favorite, I would

1943
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:25,460
say shooters.

1944
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:30,660
And on top of that, it was one of the babies that working designs released.

1945
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:31,660
There's no menu music.

1946
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:32,660
I need to fast forward here.

1947
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:35,620
Well, I think I put a timestamp in my original link.

1948
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:37,020
Sue me.

1949
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,580
There we go.

1950
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:40,580
Okay.

1951
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:49,740
So, um, and it is in the whole series that was, um, uh, Ray force, Ray crisis, you know,

1952
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:53,500
all of those, um, all of those Ray games.

1953
01:28:53,500 --> 01:29:02,020
Um, and, um, so it actually is the big thing that sets this apart from the other ones is

1954
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:09,860
that the big thing of this is it started off, um, using, uh, polygon ships instead of sprites.

1955
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:16,460
And, um, you basically have, um, different modes that you can play through.

1956
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:22,420
It actually has, uh, a few things with the PlayStation versions that made it similar

1957
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:24,300
to Xevious 3D.

1958
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:30,500
Um, but it all is pretty much that, that shooting, but it has another element to it.

1959
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:36,340
Um, with the element as well, you have, um, a, you have your laser weapon as your primary

1960
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:39,300
offense and a missile that locks onto targets.

1961
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:44,740
So you move around the screen, locking it onto a target, and then you shoot missiles.

1962
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:49,420
And then you have your special attack, where if you fill your bar to maximum, then you

1963
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:50,420
get multiple lock-ons.

1964
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:55,900
Um, you also have another one that's a hyper laser result that's basically like a, a charging

1965
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:56,900
blast.

1966
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:59,140
Um, you can play as two ships.

1967
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:06,220
One's the Argray, one that has a single laser that spreads out, um, and you have your lock-on

1968
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:08,420
and multiple missiles.

1969
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:13,140
And then the Argray 2, which is twin lasers, um, with higher attack power, but it has less

1970
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:14,140
range.

1971
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:17,420
Um, and your lock-on is 16 targets.

1972
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:19,740
Um, it has all kinds of different modes.

1973
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:23,980
You have the arcade mode, you have your extra mode that has enhanced graphics and extra

1974
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:27,940
enemies, different bosses, tougher difficulty, and a different ending.

1975
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:34,300
Um, and in extra mode, you get a continue that lets you continue to add up your score.

1976
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:41,020
There's another one that's called 13 players, which, um, if you, um, you have to complete

1977
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:46,820
the game using a total of 13 ships from five groups, three Argray 1 ships using manual,

1978
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:52,460
um, three using, uh, a different man- uh, three Argray 2 ships with manual control,

1979
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:56,860
and then you have, um, the auto methods, basically you have to use every type of method, and

1980
01:30:56,980 --> 01:31:02,620
then the Argray Zero prototype ship that you, um, basically have to obtain for the game.

1981
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:08,900
And you'll also get a fourth ship called the Argear that you will be able to play.

1982
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:16,620
So, um, this game basically, I would probably say is one of, I'd say the best games that

1983
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:19,060
came out in the PlayStation era.

1984
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:27,220
So, um, it really was, number one, a challenging game, but also a pretty game with great music

1985
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:28,220
as well.

1986
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:31,820
It's a shooter game I remember, and that says something, but it's that style, it's that

1987
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:38,060
the way the polygons are kind of like 3D-ish tilted down, like a kind of Zelda adventure

1988
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:42,740
of Link style, but more with polygons than sprites, because, you know, it's got a great

1989
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:43,740
look to it.

1990
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:49,620
Well, at any rate, um, they had talked about there being, this actually went through kind

1991
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:53,940
of an interesting development cycle for, um, actually it should be more with the North

1992
01:31:53,940 --> 01:32:00,460
American release of it, is that several companies were trying to get it released, but no one

1993
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:01,820
came forward.

1994
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:09,180
Working Designs was working with Taito to try to license Rayforce, but Acclaim stepped

1995
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:10,820
in and did that.

1996
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:15,700
So when Raystorm came out, they jumped right in on it, licensed it immediately, and met

1997
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:21,580
with Taito to talk about the conversion for an American release.

1998
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:25,780
It was their first release for the PlayStation by Working Designs, and it was released under

1999
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:30,060
their Spaz label for shooter games.

2000
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:39,540
It was also, um, the, uh, you know, listed as, you know, a full, you know, Ray game.

2001
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:42,540
I use that quote fingers that no one could see.

2002
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:47,340
And then a playable demo came out, one of those little interactive CD samplers.

2003
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:55,580
So after Squeamix acquired Taito, it came on as a PlayStation Network game in Japan

2004
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:57,420
in 2008.

2005
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:04,580
And then, um, basically all the other ones came out eventually on PlayStation 3 and PSP.

2006
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:09,060
And then there was the Raystorm HD that came out as a downloadable for PlayStation 3 and

2007
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:11,860
Xbox 360 in 2010.

2008
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:18,620
And we got it in the U.S. and Europe as well, I'm sorry North America and Europe, and, um,

2009
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:23,180
the original game though played on a Sony ZN1 JAMA board.

2010
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:29,260
So, um, there are hacked versions of it that will play on the Taito G-Net system, so there's

2011
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:30,260
that too.

2012
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:36,640
So as far as compilations that came out, there's Taito Memories Volume 2, which in Japan was

2013
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:40,140
Taito Memories Gekkan that had a bunch of other Taito games.

2014
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:46,540
There's Taito Legends 2 for PlayStation 2, G-Darius plus Raystorm pack, and, um, Simple

2015
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:52,100
1500 Series Volume 7, the double shooting for PlayStation, which also included Ray Crisis.

2016
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:54,060
I love the Simple series.

2017
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:56,060
You do?

2018
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:57,060
Yeah.

2019
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:03,060
Because the Simple 2000 series is what brought us the Defense Force and the Chambara.

2020
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:04,060
Okay.

2021
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:13,780
Um, the other thing, um, is that working designs, as they've been known to do, um, revised the

2022
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:16,700
difficulty in it.

2023
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:23,020
They basically, um, made it a little bit tougher, I think, so if you can, if you set

2024
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:28,500
the difficulty below 4, then it runs a training mode, but after 4, it's like the full version,

2025
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:35,340
so basically, it's trying to encourage people to play it on higher difficulties, um, and

2026
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:41,060
that they fixed an issue with the Japanese version where compatibility, um, with certain

2027
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:44,620
game controllers, uh, there was some issues with compatibility.

2028
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:50,540
Um, there's another version of Raystorm, uh, by Cyberfront that came out, um, for, uh,

2029
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:56,380
DOS, um, that was, uh, based off of the PlayStation release, um, but it didn't have, like, all

2030
01:34:56,380 --> 01:35:02,580
of the arranged items, and then, um, the PlayStation 2 version of Taito Memories and Taito Legends

2031
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:06,940
2 only has the arcade mode list, uh, in the series.

2032
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:16,020
Um, so yeah, basically, um, the game itself, it was considered a little short, but it was,

2033
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:24,020
you know, amazing to play, lots of fun, and of course, those, uh, difficulty, um, levels

2034
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:28,460
would, you know, definitely encourage, you know, replay and an ongoing challenge, especially

2035
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:32,860
when you're trying to unlock things and get extra, the extra ships and trying to get the

2036
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,180
true ending.

2037
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:41,380
Um, now, it did have quite the legacy, um, so Raycrisis did come out two years later,

2038
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:47,260
and it had, um, the home versions actually had the Argue 1 and 2 as hidden ships from

2039
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:53,880
this game, and then Taito, um, released, uh, Huda Huda Park that was a collection of minigames

2040
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:59,740
that was inspired by their arcade games for the, uh, that was put out for the Wii, and

2041
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:08,140
it had, um, uh, Raystorm minigames that were basically, uh, kind of bullet hell minigames,

2042
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:10,140
so there you go.

2043
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:15,140
Alright, classic game of the week, real classic shooter, Raystorm.

2044
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,740
Raystorm, what a great game.

2045
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:22,500
And don't worry, guys, I will eventually do some of the Thunder Force games, a couple

2046
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,140
of people have asked me privately.

2047
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:29,020
You know, you've done now, you're coming up on 500 classic games of the week, I mean,

2048
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:32,020
I've helped, Loki's helped, some of our guests have helped in the weeks you haven't been

2049
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:35,220
here, but you're coming up on almost 500 classic games in the archive, can you believe that?

2050
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:39,020
But remember, y'all, if you want Halo, 300 more dollars.

2051
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:43,820
Alright, um, well, we're gonna take a break, and when we come back, we have plenty more

2052
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:47,220
show to come, including rapid fire news, we're gonna do some release dates, and take your

2053
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:51,620
calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, that is all coming up after we take a quick break,

2054
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:55,020
so don't go anywhere, we're gonna be right back with the conclusion of tonight's Orange

2055
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:55,920
Lounge Radio.

2056
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:07,820
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 713

2057
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:15,420
in progress for this January the 7th of 2018, our first show of our 16th year of broadcasting,

2058
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:17,620
if you can believe it, since 2002.

2059
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:18,620
We're getting old.

2060
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:24,020
Alright, you missed some of our 2018 predictions early on, as well as kind of looking back

2061
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:27,020
at the messy notes we left ourself.

2062
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:31,420
Somebody should've told us to clean up those notes earlier, oh well, we learned for next

2063
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:32,420
time.

2064
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:35,320
Let's get back into some gaming news, and we'll get to your calls a little later at

2065
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:39,720
Orange Lounge Radio, I don't think we have emails tonight, I'm gonna have to have Dark

2066
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:43,620
Soccer let me know in the mailbag, but we may get to calls a little sooner than that

2067
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:44,620
because of that.

2068
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:46,220
So, but let's do rapid fire news first, Loki.

2069
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:50,220
Yeah, so let's talk about some games that have been translated into English.

2070
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:56,020
And so one of these games, well, it's the latest Tingle game, that's right.

2071
01:37:56,020 --> 01:38:03,620
So Ripened Tingle's Balloon Trip of Love, which was released in 2009, has now had an

2072
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:06,120
English patch created for its ROM.

2073
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:11,820
So if you feel like playing that, you can now download the patch to play it in English.

2074
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:12,820
Hooray.

2075
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:15,620
I'm so happy that you are reporting this news to us.

2076
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:16,620
Yes.

2077
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:21,300
Another game that's also been translated in English now is Super Famicom Wars, is now

2078
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:24,120
playable in English as well.

2079
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:29,680
It came out, I guess, on the Game Boy Advance in Japan.

2080
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:33,560
But yeah, that's pretty cool as well.

2081
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:40,520
And of course, if you're not into translations, maybe you're into fan mods, in which case

2082
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:46,420
you can play the newer Super Mario Brothers DS.

2083
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:52,080
So they did a newer Super Mario Brothers game out on the Wii, but this is actually a mod

2084
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,280
of the DS game.

2085
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:59,600
It's a fan-made game, and you can actually only play it on the PC, because it doesn't

2086
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,780
run in an actual ROM.

2087
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:09,780
But yeah, it was made using the new Super Mario Brothers editor, apparently.

2088
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:15,880
So there you have 80 levels, eight world maps, and they even had some changes to the graphics

2089
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:18,880
and a new soundtrack.

2090
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,420
So you can check that out as well online.

2091
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:25,340
That's cool that they even went in and did the soundtrack.

2092
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:27,540
Yeah, the music was different.

2093
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:33,620
I didn't really play the new Super Mario Brothers on DS, or at least not enough to see half

2094
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:34,620
this stuff.

2095
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:38,620
So I'm not positive how much of this is all really new, but I see Mario in a minecart.

2096
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:40,180
I don't remember if that was in the game.

2097
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:41,740
Yeah, that's pretty neat.

2098
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:46,380
All right, well, a little change in Pokemon Go, for those of you that are still playing

2099
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:47,880
Pokemon Go.

2100
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:51,500
It's a lot more of you than people tend to think, because I was at...

2101
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:56,060
I didn't talk about this on the show, but I went to a nest here locally.

2102
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:58,100
You know how Pokemons nest in certain areas?

2103
01:39:58,100 --> 01:40:02,180
So over in a not so great part of town is where the Wailmers are nesting.

2104
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:08,340
And Wailmer is a Gen 3 whale Pokemon, and like Magikarp, it takes 400 candies to evolve

2105
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:09,340
one.

2106
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:10,940
So you have to catch a lot of Wailmers, right?

2107
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:15,180
So I was actually at a farm, and there was a lot of people walking around that park and

2108
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:17,740
all staring at their phones, playing Pokemon Go.

2109
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:19,500
So it's still a thing.

2110
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:24,140
So I know there's some people that were a little sad to hear that, yes, there are more

2111
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:27,380
Pokemon that are being region exclusived.

2112
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:30,420
But this time, something unique happened this past week.

2113
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:31,780
They flipped.

2114
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:36,300
So Zangoose and Seviper were region exclusives.

2115
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:40,340
And that's probably because in the original anime and in the games, they had a little

2116
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:41,340
bit of a feud.

2117
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:45,100
Because I don't know if you guys know, but Mongooses and Mongoose snakes are kind of

2118
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:46,100
like a rivalry.

2119
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:47,660
Yes, I saw Ricky Tiki Tavi as well.

2120
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:48,660
Yeah, there you go.

2121
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:50,660
They have rivalry in the games as well.

2122
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:52,560
So they stay far away from each other.

2123
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:59,100
But unlike Kangaskhan and Taros and Mr. Mime, what happened is that Zangoose and Seviper

2124
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:00,340
flipped.

2125
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:01,500
So they flipped.

2126
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:04,580
So now we can't catch Zangoose anymore.

2127
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:08,540
Hopefully you got one while they were here, but you can get Seviper, which I still have

2128
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:11,460
yet to see one, but I'm hoping I get to see either of those.

2129
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:14,980
Well, the good news, there was a Zangoose on the house here not that long ago.

2130
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:18,620
I'm lucky in that for some reason, like there's always like three Pokemon on top of the house.

2131
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:20,580
Yeah.

2132
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:21,580
Yeah.

2133
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:25,060
So, uh, but something to keep in mind is that if they flip this, maybe they'll flip back.

2134
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:29,660
But what I'm really hoping is that Plusle and Minosyn, I hope I said their names right,

2135
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:30,860
but it's plus and minus.

2136
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:33,420
Little Pikachu ripoffs, the battery Pikachus.

2137
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,940
The battery Pikachus are also region exclusive.

2138
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:41,340
So we have Plus and Asia and you know, everything on the other side of the ocean has a minus.

2139
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:43,660
Remember when I run one plus use of those at E3?

2140
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:44,660
Oh, I do.

2141
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:45,660
They're so cute.

2142
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:46,660
I need to get them back from Julie.

2143
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:47,660
They are really cute.

2144
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:49,660
Maybe those guys will flip too.

2145
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:50,660
That would be very nice.

2146
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:55,500
So, uh, JD in our chat says, I got two, it's been very cloudy.

2147
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:59,220
So poison boost and act F correcting me on the names there.

2148
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:07,740
Plusle and minion are the names there, um, over at live.vognetwork.com.

2149
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:13,960
All right, let's move on to one other quick news, which has to do with the Miiverse archive.

2150
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:19,120
The Miiverse archive or archive verse has, uh, been made live.

2151
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:20,120
It's up.

2152
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:25,600
Uh, you can dig through old Miiverse posts from the Wii U and the 3DS, apparently over

2153
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:33,240
8 million user profiles, 133 million posts, 75 million screenshots, 72 million drawings,

2154
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:37,360
almost 17 terabytes of data.

2155
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:40,720
And what's really cool about this is one of the big guys behind this, it's doing this

2156
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:46,640
drastic actions, uh, has listened to, uh, some of our podcasts in the past, at least

2157
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:47,640
more Bobby Black Wolf.

2158
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:48,640
I know.

2159
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,440
And in fact, Bobby Black Wolf had him on a show.

2160
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:52,840
Uh, I think it was the week I was in Seattle.

2161
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:53,840
So it was in early November.

2162
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,540
So if you want to hear more about the project, you can check out that episode of Bobby Black

2163
01:42:57,540 --> 01:43:02,640
Wolf show, but it is noteworthy that the project did go live this past week.

2164
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:04,480
So a lot of people are checking it out.

2165
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:09,960
So if you want to check out the, uh, archive, you can do that at Archie verse, A R C H I

2166
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:14,680
V E R S E dot guide G U I D E.

2167
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:20,360
There you go to register participation for this week's episode of orange laundry 80 with

2168
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,880
vog network.com.

2169
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:27,400
Use the passphrase B let's move on and our soccer.

2170
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:34,160
You have a couple for us, a couple, um, it would help if they didn't like go off my screen.

2171
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:35,160
There we go.

2172
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:39,880
Um, so the IGN editor in chief was fired.

2173
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:44,000
Um, basically it was over alleged misconduct.

2174
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:51,940
Um, so basically, um, IGN, uh, put out the investigation regarding Steve Butts and as

2175
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:55,760
a result, they have decided to part ways with him.

2176
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:02,560
Um, this was a statement by Mitch Galbraith, who is the executive vice president.

2177
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:09,400
Um, and the, uh, co-founder and chief content officer, Pierre Schneider will be taking over

2178
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:11,560
as editor in chief on the interim.

2179
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:17,640
Um, the update, um, basically says that Pierre Schneider will be taking over as long as it

2180
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:20,160
takes to get everything right.

2181
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:26,080
Um, so yeah, pretty, uh, crazy stuff.

2182
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:31,240
Also noteworthy as, you know, IGN was in the news not that long ago for purchasing humble

2183
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:32,240
bundle.

2184
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:37,340
So this, you know, transition, which, you know, if the allegations are true by sounds

2185
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:40,320
like 2017 is continuing to take out the garbage.

2186
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,520
Um, but, uh, definitely garbage.

2187
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:48,920
So anyway, but looking, looking to new year, new me, new society, um, hopefully, uh, the

2188
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:52,640
humble bundle, you know, and all that stuff is going to be overseen by this new guy here.

2189
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:56,840
Well, the other thing too, is that this basically stemmed from, I'm going to mispronounce her

2190
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:02,120
last name, but it's Kelly plague, plague, P L A G G E.

2191
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:03,680
Who is an editor at GameStop.

2192
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:06,520
She went public, um, uh, for game spot.

2193
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:12,240
Sorry, went public about her experiences working at IGN, that a senior staff targeted her and

2194
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:17,260
another female editor with quote manipulative and abusive comments.

2195
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:21,080
And it was also terribly mishandled by HR.

2196
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:24,880
And that's why she left because she didn't feel safe at her job.

2197
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:29,440
So I know a lot of talk in the golden globes going on tonight has to do with everything

2198
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:32,840
that we heard about with the, the garbage dumping in the film industry this past year.

2199
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:38,100
So just a unfortunate reminder that it wasn't just the movie industry that was affected

2200
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:45,720
by this, but you know, to try to turn, you know, something that's horrible into something

2201
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:49,240
better, you know, at least this shift in our society.

2202
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:53,400
Hopefully a lot of us are kind of reflecting going, you know, I'm going to make it my resolution

2203
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:57,600
or whatever you want to call it to not be shitty to people.

2204
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:06,480
You know what, and it's, it's a little bit of a quote, but if, and this especially goes,

2205
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:13,680
if you are teaching your daughters to be careful around men, then teach your sons what consent

2206
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:16,220
is.

2207
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:19,160
You know, it's fucking stupid.

2208
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:23,000
Don't pass on this whole toxic masculinity thing.

2209
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,200
Teach your, teach your kids to not be shit hole garbage.

2210
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,200
Yeah.

2211
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,800
Let's end it.

2212
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,240
You know, if the, if the millennials really want to stick it to the boomers for all the

2213
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:38,200
bullshit avocado toast articles, be the generation that ends this shit.

2214
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:39,200
Do it.

2215
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:40,200
Do it.

2216
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:43,560
You can, you can start right now by teaching your kids to stand up for what they believe

2217
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,940
no matter how bullied or picked on they are.

2218
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:49,440
As borderline shillenials or whatever they call that.

2219
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,440
It's zenial.

2220
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:51,440
Zenial.

2221
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:55,480
And I think I am just at the edge of Gen X.

2222
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:56,480
Yeah.

2223
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:57,760
You know, whatever.

2224
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:58,760
Well anyway.

2225
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:00,600
We were the, we were the awesome ones cause we had grunge.

2226
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,600
And Radiohead.

2227
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:13,960
Anyway, so another good, this is some good news, is that basically the, the developer

2228
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:21,480
at Capcom who is behind Rival Schools and Capcom versus SNK and Devil May Cry, Itsu

2229
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:29,000
no Hideaki, basically has come out and said that they are working on a new game under

2230
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Climax.

2231
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,040
In fact, I'll just read the quote, happy new, and it's in English by the way, um, happy

2232
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:35,040
new year.

2233
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:38,720
I am sorry that I cannot present a new project last year.

2234
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:42,320
The development of the project is now under Climax.

2235
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,080
I am making a great game.

2236
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,880
So please expect it.

2237
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:50,080
It does kind of sound like you ran it through Google translate.

2238
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,080
A little bit.

2239
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:55,760
Well, honestly enough, usually if I can't figure out how to say something right in Japanese,

2240
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:58,680
it comes out sounding like it came through Google translate as well.

2241
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:05,600
So, um, but, uh, we're hoping that it's a fighting game.

2242
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:08,600
I would really, really like another Rival Schools.

2243
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:12,360
Um, cause I mean, that's serious, your expectations.

2244
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:16,320
So you're not mad if it isn't, but well, the gaming industry, I already predicted I would

2245
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,320
be disappointed the entire year.

2246
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,120
So that's true.

2247
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:21,920
We'll see how that stays out.

2248
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:26,560
Um, but if God, if we have another Rival Schools, that'd make me happy.

2249
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:27,560
Of course.

2250
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:28,560
I'm also, you're not alone in that.

2251
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,960
You know, I didn't put it in the time capsule.

2252
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,960
I should have put the one game I'm looking forward to, which is a Dragon Ball Fighter

2253
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:35,960
Z.

2254
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,320
Oh, there that's not that long that you have to wait for that.

2255
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:39,320
No, not at all.

2256
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:44,840
That's going to be mine, especially since I'm, God, I hate this current art.

2257
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:48,560
You didn't, you didn't put that on your games that you were anticipating to be good.

2258
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:51,000
I didn't, I didn't make a list of games I anticipated to be good.

2259
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Oh, I thought you did.

2260
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,520
No, I could just go write it down real quick and put it in there.

2261
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,160
Do it when I'm not looking.

2262
01:48:57,160 --> 01:48:58,160
It's sealed.

2263
01:48:58,160 --> 01:48:59,160
Okay.

2264
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:00,160
All right.

2265
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:03,400
But, um, but, uh, I'm kind of disappointed with the current story arc in Dragon Ball

2266
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:11,040
Super cause I, it's more of the endless stream of bullshit filler, but I do like a lot of

2267
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,920
the characters that are in it and finding out that some of these characters are going

2268
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:14,920
to be in the game.

2269
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:17,400
It makes me really happy.

2270
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:20,460
You know, what's weird since you brought up anime, you know, I've been talking a lot about

2271
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:24,320
magfest all the way out in Washington DC, the other coast, right?

2272
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:28,340
Yet here locally this weekend, we had a con that's actually getting bigger and bigger.

2273
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:32,240
Like Rama was making posts about things that were happening out here at SAC anime.

2274
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:36,840
I don't know if you guys, but, but yet none of us went for some reason.

2275
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:41,240
I heard actually, uh, our buddy Shane went and I know was trying to meet one of the voice

2276
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:44,960
actors from Danganronpa and there was a ton of Overwatch voice actors there, I guess,

2277
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,880
but I just didn't make it out to SAC anime.

2278
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:53,360
I went to one of the earlier ones that was like the now destroyed red lion in a panel.

2279
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:57,780
We did a panel at SAC anime when it was still, maybe we should look into doing a panel for

2280
01:49:57,780 --> 01:50:02,400
like the summer version, which I think the good, the game bang guys do.

2281
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:03,400
So why not?

2282
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,840
Maybe we should do something with them about podcasting.

2283
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,840
Yeah.

2284
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:14,500
Offered a Voltron it up like, like we do for, did for gamer X number one game podcasts.

2285
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:16,980
So, you know, I don't know if we can touch that.

2286
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:23,860
I'm going to assume that was an old banner before they, uh, I know we're going to give

2287
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:27,620
them a little shit, but you know, nothing but love for the other indie podcasts.

2288
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:34,480
That's number one against what really us, well, no, I mean, I think there's a couple

2289
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:35,480
others based.

2290
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:36,480
This is Sacramento.

2291
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:41,020
Ladies that have a board game podcast, I think video games and that's not video games.

2292
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:43,960
So I guess it's just us.

2293
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:46,160
And you know what, there's gotta be others.

2294
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:47,160
There's so many gaming podcasts.

2295
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:48,160
I just don't know about them all.

2296
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:52,400
Oh, um, uh, the, the, the, uh, princess Irene had a show.

2297
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:53,400
That's right.

2298
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:54,400
Is she doing it anymore?

2299
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:56,840
I don't know if they put out new episodes lately.

2300
01:50:56,840 --> 01:51:02,320
I don't know if they have, so yeah, anyway, all right, moving on.

2301
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:06,400
Uh, this would be the part of the show where we would get to the mail bag.

2302
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:07,400
I should just say it now.

2303
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:10,840
I'm doing things out of order, uh, but there are no mails tonight.

2304
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:16,680
So if you want to send us an email to read next week, participate at orange lounge, radio.com

2305
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:20,200
would be the address to send that to a reminder.

2306
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:21,200
Next week.

2307
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:26,560
Uh, we're going to have, uh, I believe last I counted for ladies who play Ingress, which

2308
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:27,800
is a game we've talked about on the show.

2309
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:31,280
I know, I know not all of you are into it, but I thought it would still be fun to talk

2310
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:32,280
about.

2311
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:34,000
We're not going to nerd out completely about the inner inner workings of it.

2312
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Cause I don't want to be those.

2313
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
You guys don't play it.

2314
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
I don't want you to be bored.

2315
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,200
Um, but we are just going to talk about like, you know, kind of more like the why, you know,

2316
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:41,920
why do you play a, why is exciting?

2317
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:45,000
Cause, um, I think some of these gals do play a lot of other games.

2318
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,760
I think some of them don't, they only play this.

2319
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,760
So it'll be kind of a fun show.

2320
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:51,480
So if you want to send emails to ask questions about that, uh, you can do that.

2321
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:53,920
Participate at orange launch, radio.com, or really you can bring up anything.

2322
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,240
You want to bring up a topic we talked about tonight or something new participate at orange

2323
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:58,240
launch radio.

2324
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:01,280
I'm sure that show will never go on tangents.

2325
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,280
We don't go.

2326
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:03,280
I'm a little, yeah.

2327
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:07,200
Next week show is probably going to be, and to top it all off, I just want to point out

2328
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:12,040
next week is a three day weekend because smart Luther King day is the next Monday.

2329
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:17,420
So if I wanted to have a, I have a cocktail during the show.

2330
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:22,160
So on top of that, on top of the women taking over the show next week, which is fine.

2331
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:23,520
I'm all for all for that.

2332
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:28,200
Uh, I might, I may be intoxicated on top of that, so it'd be fun for the makings of a

2333
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:29,200
great show.

2334
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:30,200
Yeah.

2335
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:31,200
It's all, it's all adding up.

2336
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:32,200
This will be it.

2337
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:33,200
All right.

2338
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:36,280
Let's move on to some release dates, although I think it's a little slow this week, right?

2339
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:37,360
Yeah.

2340
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:39,760
It's still a bit early before the releases come out.

2341
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:44,160
They still haven't quite gotten off of their holiday, but we do have a game coming out

2342
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:49,000
on the switch of escapists to, we'll be coming on the switch this week and that's literally

2343
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
it.

2344
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Yeah.

2345
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,520
The switch has still been pretty good about the digital releases.

2346
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:54,520
Yeah.

2347
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:55,520
Yeah.

2348
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:56,520
And that's true.

2349
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:57,520
All right.

2350
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,700
Well coming out this week in Japan, Dissidia final fantasy NT.

2351
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:00,700
That's right.

2352
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:02,560
The Dissidia games getting its release in Japan this week.

2353
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:05,400
Us still has to wait a couple of weeks past 30th.

2354
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:06,400
Yeah.

2355
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,240
So I am curious though to see some gameplay though of it.

2356
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:09,240
Yeah.

2357
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:10,240
Some of you.

2358
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:11,240
Yeah.

2359
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:12,240
I'm very curious about the gameplay and some of you may not be able to wait and may just

2360
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,240
import it.

2361
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:14,240
So that'd be cool.

2362
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,240
Uh, she, I'll say a shoe.

2363
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:18,960
No kind of Indian sign that comes out as well from D three on a PS four this week.

2364
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:24,000
And then danganronpa three, uh, gets a price reduction as it moves into the best price.

2365
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,960
So I think that means there will probably be more danganronpa games.

2366
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:30,300
I don't think this will be the end of it, by the way, on the PlayStation Vita where

2367
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:33,680
danganronpa V3 also exists in Japan.

2368
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:36,060
It is also getting a price reduction over there.

2369
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:39,800
So check that out on the 11th, uh, nothing on the Nintendo switch.

2370
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:44,600
However, I think Dissidia is kind of the lone Wolf released this week, uh, over in Japan.

2371
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:48,940
So I did want to mention as a random, cause I was kind of gleaming through the list for

2372
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:51,060
that's coming out for the next few months here.

2373
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:55,520
I did notice a title, um, called, what was it?

2374
01:53:55,520 --> 01:54:03,520
The, um, a certain magical virtual on what a certain magical virtual.

2375
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:06,160
On from Sega.

2376
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:09,660
It's coming out and PlayStation four and the Vita.

2377
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:10,660
Is it from Sega?

2378
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,760
Uh, it is from Sega.

2379
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:13,760
Oh boy.

2380
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:14,760
Oh boy.

2381
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:15,760
Dars.

2382
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:16,760
Oh shit.

2383
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,080
What is, I think we did.

2384
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:23,720
I think I remember, um, something about this where it's, it's sort of like a total magic

2385
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:30,680
sooner virtual on, you know, interesting.

2386
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:31,680
All right.

2387
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:36,640
And, uh, adaption and sequel to the crossover light novel.

2388
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:43,920
That was a crossover between, um, the Tawaru series and Denno Senki virtual on.

2389
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:44,920
So yeah.

2390
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:49,040
Well, Jamie, do we have anything in the UK this week or is it pretty quiet over there?

2391
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:56,080
A few things on the 10th, Furi or is it Furi anyway?

2392
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:57,560
It's Furi Furi both.

2393
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:59,920
And on the 12th, the nightfall for PC.

2394
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:01,520
All right.

2395
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:03,080
Let's get back into some other news.

2396
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:07,640
And pretty soon your calls at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype, Loki, you're

2397
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:08,640
excited about this, right?

2398
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:09,840
Super hyped about this.

2399
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:13,740
So out of all the remasters that they could do, at least they picked a great one.

2400
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:20,800
And so coming out this spring, EA will be releasing a remaster of burnout paradise.

2401
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:21,800
Woo.

2402
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:22,800
Hell yeah.

2403
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,240
Stan's pretty happy about that.

2404
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:25,240
Yeah.

2405
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:26,240
This is, this is good news all around.

2406
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:27,240
Yeah.

2407
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:28,680
So it's going to be a remaster.

2408
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:30,680
Um, it's scheduled to launch.

2409
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:32,320
But are they still going to have the music licenses?

2410
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:38,640
So when I turn it on, take me down to the paradise city, like, is it still gonna, I

2411
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:39,640
don't know.

2412
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:40,640
Let's hope.

2413
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:45,640
Um, but yeah, this was, uh, they, there was an announcement on Twitter, um, talking about

2414
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:48,200
the remasters coming out in Japan, March 16.

2415
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:52,920
So I'd assume that the U S version probably around the same time, um, no word on music

2416
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:56,800
licenses yet and no official confirmation yet either.

2417
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:02,560
But hopefully that's soon, uh, act deaf to chat says, I want a new burnout.

2418
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:07,400
So I mean, w will you accept this remaster in lieu of a new burnout at least I will accept

2419
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:08,400
it for now.

2420
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:09,400
It's something, it's a holdover.

2421
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:10,720
It's an, it's a nice bandit.

2422
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,720
It's a nice severance.

2423
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:17,600
It's a nice offering from EA who let's be real EA is pissed off a lot of people.

2424
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:21,960
So this is a nice little like throw this slab of meat at the pack of wolves.

2425
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:26,760
Remember they were developing their like own, like criteria was developing their own like

2426
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:29,180
extreme sports game that kind of went under.

2427
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:30,180
So dope.

2428
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:35,240
Um, I don't remember what they're working on now, but can it be a new burnout game?

2429
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:36,240
I mean, come on.

2430
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:37,240
Cause it needs for speed.

2431
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:38,560
Games have been kind of lame.

2432
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:44,120
So I'd be fine with the burnout remake early part of the year and a new burnout game at

2433
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:48,180
the end of the year, uh, act Efton chat says, do you still want Avril Lavigne's girlfriend

2434
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:49,180
in the game?

2435
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:50,180
I forgot that was going to have to have it.

2436
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:53,200
You kind of have to, it's, it's a sign of the times at this point.

2437
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:56,440
But what I really want to do is I want to replace the music cause you could do this

2438
01:56:56,440 --> 01:56:57,440
on Xbox 360.

2439
01:56:57,440 --> 01:56:59,080
You play your custom soundtracks.

2440
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:02,440
So why not have my awesome nineties soundtrack?

2441
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:06,400
And so I can, you know, when my pink car cause you know, I drive a pink car comes out.

2442
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:07,400
I want that.

2443
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:08,400
Oh, don't don't.

2444
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:09,400
Oh baby.

2445
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:10,400
Baby.

2446
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,360
How was, I suppose.

2447
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:14,560
Cause you know, that's how I play burnout.

2448
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:17,840
I'm going to have to replace it all with super Euro beat.

2449
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:18,840
Super Euro beat.

2450
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:19,840
You're driving fast.

2451
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:20,840
You kind of have to.

2452
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:21,840
It's fair.

2453
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:22,840
It's fair.

2454
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:24,160
Or just take the sound soundtrack to Wangan midnight maximum.

2455
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:25,160
There you go.

2456
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:26,160
Yeah.

2457
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:27,880
There's more driving there.

2458
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:28,880
Yeah, of course.

2459
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:29,880
Of course.

2460
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:31,480
JD says, replace the music with gay beats.

2461
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:32,480
Why not?

2462
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:33,480
PlayStation four taps into Spotify.

2463
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:35,200
I got my playlist ready to go.

2464
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:38,200
Let's do it anyway.

2465
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:39,200
I'm down.

2466
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:40,200
This is a day one for me.

2467
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:41,200
I know.

2468
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:44,520
I'm so I'm like, I actually am more excited about burnout paradise right now on my PC.

2469
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:48,400
It's like backwards compatible on Xbox one even, isn't it?

2470
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:49,400
Uh, yes.

2471
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:50,400
Yeah.

2472
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:51,400
It is.

2473
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:52,400
Um, so yeah.

2474
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:53,400
So let's do it.

2475
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,400
All right.

2476
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:59,320
Xbox one, uh, rest in peace connect, uh, the connect pretty much.

2477
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:00,360
I mean, I don't know.

2478
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:03,480
This is circulating all the blogs this week and I'm kind of like, this is kind of one

2479
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:07,920
of those foregone conclusion type of things because when was the last time a connect game

2480
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:08,920
came out?

2481
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:09,920
It's been a couple of years now.

2482
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:10,920
Right?

2483
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:17,680
I, yeah, I guess just dance still supports connect, but even just dances technically

2484
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:23,960
to the mobile, technically the remakes or remasters of the Disney connect the games

2485
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:28,240
supported connect, but they weren't, but then they also made it, but they weren't connected

2486
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:29,240
game anymore.

2487
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:30,240
Yeah.

2488
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:31,240
Yeah.

2489
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:32,240
So anyway, here's the deal.

2490
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:33,680
The adapters are no longer being made.

2491
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:35,920
So Microsoft deceased production of these.

2492
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:39,360
You have to have one of these adapters to make the connect work on the Xbox one S and

2493
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,360
the Xbox one X.

2494
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:44,640
Uh, and then in a statement Microsoft said, after careful consideration, we decided to

2495
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:49,120
stop manufacturing the Xbox connect adapter to focus attention on launching new higher

2496
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:53,720
fan requested gaming accessories across as box Xbox one and windows 10.

2497
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:58,560
So of course we don't know what that is, but that could be anything from hollow lens coming

2498
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:03,860
out events early, who knows to whatever else Microsoft may be working on random PR speak

2499
01:59:03,860 --> 01:59:09,760
that just, you know, and again, I was, I kind of already had said my goodbye to the connect.

2500
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:14,700
You know, I think ever since they uncoupled the connect from the Xbox one, we all kind

2501
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:15,880
of saw this coming.

2502
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:21,360
Um, you know, but I think as much as people want to look back and go, Oh God, the connect

2503
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:22,640
was kind of garbage.

2504
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:23,640
Was it though?

2505
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:28,040
Like people were really into it when it first came for games again, cause I realized there's

2506
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:30,400
a whole nother side to this for games.

2507
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:33,760
People were really into dance central and I fucking love dance center.

2508
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:34,760
It was awesome.

2509
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:35,760
Pretty awesome.

2510
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:36,760
It was pretty deep.

2511
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:39,000
When the games were good, they were really good when they were bad.

2512
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,040
It was obvious.

2513
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:43,640
It was a problem where like a lot of companies didn't know how to utilize it and they came

2514
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:49,960
up with like a bunch and even Microsoft, you know, the, they, they did a lot of this, you

2515
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:54,200
know, where it's like you can shout grenade and you throw a grenade.

2516
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:59,200
It's like, really is that much more convenient than pushing a button to throw a grenade is,

2517
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:04,680
is that really, you know, they have like, Oh, you could do all this voice searching

2518
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:05,680
and stuff like that.

2519
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:14,320
And, um, you know, the Xbox and honestly like I've got voice search on my, um, my media

2520
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:17,400
box, my Android TV or whatever.

2521
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:18,400
Never use it.

2522
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:22,560
So I thought you had to have a connect to do live streaming on Twitch through Xbox one,

2523
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:24,760
but is it true now that it supports any USB camera?

2524
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:27,920
Cause I thought I heard Bobby say that on his show and I was like, Whoa, that's news

2525
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:28,920
to me.

2526
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:30,360
I could have been streaming on Xbox one this whole time.

2527
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:31,360
Didn't even realize it.

2528
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:32,360
Yeah.

2529
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:37,260
Cause I have an old camera cause I upgraded the camera in the studio or in my office that

2530
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:39,780
I use with the green screen for, for Twitch and everything.

2531
02:00:39,780 --> 02:00:43,000
But I saw my old camera, which isn't bad and I could use that on my Xbox one.

2532
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,340
So even with just the streaming stuff where like the camera followed you around, if you're

2533
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:51,700
walking around, that was kind of cool, but like one, since you're kind of bridging it

2534
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:54,720
to it, it did a lot for, you know, non game stuff.

2535
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:59,140
Like we've all heard the story about how connect was great in hospitals because it allowed

2536
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:02,860
people to, you know, keep the environment sterile because when you're using motion and

2537
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:06,620
not using the actual tools or anything, you're just using, you know, air, you're not getting

2538
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:09,180
anything dirty so you can keep the environment sterile.

2539
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:14,900
So, you know, connect has done a lot of great things for, you know, other types of stuff

2540
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:19,820
that isn't just games, but it brought Para to the Xbox three six.

2541
02:01:19,820 --> 02:01:20,820
Why not?

2542
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:21,820
Why not?

2543
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:22,820
Because they had dance paradise.

2544
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:23,820
That's true.

2545
02:01:23,820 --> 02:01:24,820
They had dance paradise.

2546
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:26,420
It was a terrible game, but it could have been better.

2547
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:28,780
It was just, it was hard to, it was hard to understand.

2548
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:32,860
Next to dance central, dance central kind of, yeah, dance central is much better.

2549
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:39,540
Although, although if we're going to be fair, dead central, while it was an excellent game,

2550
02:01:39,540 --> 02:01:45,660
if it weren't for Dan central, we wouldn't have the stupid dancing game that was in star

2551
02:01:45,660 --> 02:01:46,660
Wars connect.

2552
02:01:46,660 --> 02:01:49,900
I was about to say star Wars connect was kind of the beginning of the end.

2553
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:50,900
Yes.

2554
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:51,900
Star Wars connect.

2555
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:52,900
No.

2556
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:53,900
Yeah.

2557
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:54,900
That was kind of the beginning of the end.

2558
02:01:54,900 --> 02:01:58,600
Bad, bad Microsoft and a Bobby confirming in our chat at live.vognetwork.com it does

2559
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:00,200
support USB cameras as of October.

2560
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:01,360
See, that's news to me.

2561
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:02,360
So that's awesome.

2562
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:03,360
Cool.

2563
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:06,600
So, well, you know, who knows the connect maybe back in some other form or technology.

2564
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:07,600
I hope not.

2565
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:09,240
Well, I don't, here's the thing.

2566
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:14,480
I think the whole like dual cameras to kind of sense like space and stuff like that kind

2567
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:20,560
of like you see that type of technology in mobile phones at this point, like how does

2568
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:22,560
Apple's portrait mode work?

2569
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:23,560
It's kind of similar.

2570
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:28,880
I mean, it's, it's different, but it's, or the face scanning technology is just, it's

2571
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:31,000
not that dissimilar from connect.

2572
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,600
It's just a lot more advanced because it's many more fricking laser beams going at your

2573
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:35,600
face.

2574
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:41,760
So I think the legacy of this technology is going to be in devices from here on out.

2575
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:45,320
But as far as connects time and gaming, we're done.

2576
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:46,760
I just don't want them to release it.

2577
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:49,840
They better not release another connect with the next system or something like that.

2578
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,160
I hope they don't do something like that.

2579
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:55,400
Because I've already been burned so many times, so I, I don't trust them anymore.

2580
02:02:55,400 --> 02:03:00,480
All right, let's move on with some more stories and I think you have something for us, right

2581
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:01,480
Jamie?

2582
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:02,480
I do.

2583
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:03,480
Don't I?

2584
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:04,480
You sure do.

2585
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:05,480
I think it's a world traveling story.

2586
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:06,480
Yep.

2587
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:09,080
It's about Spain.

2588
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:18,400
Basically a lot of independent developers in Spain are pretty much going to be really

2589
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:19,400
unhappy.

2590
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:28,280
They have had a, there's been a decision passed on in the government to block 2 million euros,

2591
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:37,760
which is about 2.4 million dollars in European Union funding for local gaming, for game development.

2592
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:45,860
The minister of energy, tourism and digital agenda, Alvaro Nadal, canceled the grant,

2593
02:03:45,860 --> 02:03:49,580
which was going to go to 20 different developers.

2594
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:55,340
Each developer would have received between 50,000 and 150,000 euros.

2595
02:03:55,340 --> 02:04:00,060
And some of them were for teams of five people or fewer who were working on their first game.

2596
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:08,740
So it's really been a major, a major hurdle, I really, some of the most recent games and

2597
02:04:08,740 --> 02:04:14,620
forthcoming games that were coming out of Spain was Crossing Souls from 4 Attic, Metroid,

2598
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:21,540
Samus Returns from Mercury, Steam, and Rime and the Sexy Brutale from Tequila Works.

2599
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:28,820
So and then basically now, there's been an update to this since I first read it, is that

2600
02:04:28,820 --> 02:04:34,740
they are working on restructuring the grant rather than cutting it completely so that

2601
02:04:34,740 --> 02:04:39,420
they, I guess, can make sure that the money will be used wisely and used efficiently.

2602
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:46,800
So I guess they are doing it, but then again, just that first announcement just seemed like

2603
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,720
quite the blow.

2604
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:55,340
So just a reminder that games come from all sorts of places, not just the US and Canada.

2605
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:56,340
Totally.

2606
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:57,340
So just a reminder.

2607
02:04:57,340 --> 02:04:58,340
All right.

2608
02:04:58,340 --> 02:05:02,940
And Japan, of course, I can't leave them out, but you know, games come from Europe as well.

2609
02:05:02,940 --> 02:05:03,940
All right.

2610
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:04,940
Loki.

2611
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:09,700
All right, so there's a brand new expansion, or no, it was a mod that's being worked on

2612
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:14,540
that expands Skyrim because, you know, there's a ton of those, but this one's been in the

2613
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:22,020
works since 2015, and it's an expansion mod called Lordbound, and basically they've added

2614
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:28,460
about 15 to 30 hours of extra content, tons of new dungeons and whatnot.

2615
02:05:28,460 --> 02:05:33,700
It's supposed to be taking place in a location called Drudatch Valley, which they say is

2616
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:39,940
a new location, not in Skyrim, but it sits between High Rock and Skyrim.

2617
02:05:39,940 --> 02:05:48,500
So since I don't know shit about the Elder Scrolls geography, cool, I guess.

2618
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:53,540
But it does look really neat, and so I guess if you want to check it out, they have more

2619
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:58,620
progress that you can follow up on, on a ModDB.

2620
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:01,140
But yeah, it's coming soon.

2621
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:04,260
2018 is what they're shooting for, for a release for it.

2622
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:05,260
It looks really cool.

2623
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:08,820
When do you think we're going to get an Elder Scrolls VI to fuck around with?

2624
02:06:08,820 --> 02:06:12,140
Like you know, Skyrim's been out a while now, like I know it's like, it's all new again

2625
02:06:12,140 --> 02:06:15,140
because of the Switch, but in reality, that game is aging.

2626
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:16,620
Hopefully soon.

2627
02:06:16,620 --> 02:06:20,540
They've kind of, I don't know if there's supposed to be another Fallout game, like if they've

2628
02:06:20,540 --> 02:06:24,220
got another team doing almost like a Fallout Vegas, or a New Vegas, or if we're going to

2629
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:29,300
get any more remasters, maybe like a remaster of like a Fallout New Vegas or something,

2630
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:30,860
which I'd play that.

2631
02:06:30,860 --> 02:06:33,740
I need to go and finish four.

2632
02:06:33,740 --> 02:06:38,540
The problem with four is I already know how it ends, and I don't want to go back into

2633
02:06:38,540 --> 02:06:39,540
it.

2634
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:42,380
But I bought all the season pass stuff, which is probably a mistake if I haven't played

2635
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:43,380
through any of that.

2636
02:06:43,380 --> 02:06:44,380
Oh, just check it out.

2637
02:06:44,380 --> 02:06:46,700
Kaijuto in chat says, this mod sounds awful.

2638
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:52,500
It could be, but 38 hours extra content, I mean, being that I've already dropped several

2639
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:56,460
thousands of hours into Skyrim, why not more?

2640
02:06:56,460 --> 02:07:01,540
I do want at some point to stream stuff, and Skyrim would definitely be one of my first

2641
02:07:01,540 --> 02:07:02,540
choices.

2642
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:03,540
Do it.

2643
02:07:03,540 --> 02:07:04,540
Do it.

2644
02:07:04,540 --> 02:07:05,540
All right.

2645
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:08,460
Well, last but not least tonight, and y'all were wondering when I was going to officially

2646
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:10,780
bring it up, I saved the best for last, y'all.

2647
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:14,300
I wanted to mention, and I think it's already kind of been mentioned tonight, because I'm

2648
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:18,740
sure a lot of you have noticed, you may be watching it in another tab, but awesome Games

2649
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:21,860
Done Quick is underway.

2650
02:07:21,860 --> 02:07:23,380
You can check it out, of course, on Twitch.

2651
02:07:23,380 --> 02:07:26,660
You can also look at their website, gamesdonequick.com.

2652
02:07:26,660 --> 02:07:30,860
They have a full schedule posted over at Games Done Quick, and I think right now, what are

2653
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:31,860
they on?

2654
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:34,300
Were there any, because I know they, oh, excuse me.

2655
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:38,180
They started Blaster Master Zero while we were mid-show, so I think they're about to,

2656
02:07:38,180 --> 02:07:41,380
they're still on probably Batman Arkham Asylum, it sounds like, and they're about to get into

2657
02:07:41,380 --> 02:07:45,660
Little Big Planet 2, where they're going to do a co-op speed run on New Game Plus.

2658
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:46,660
So that'll be interesting.

2659
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:47,740
Remember Little Big Planet?

2660
02:07:47,740 --> 02:07:48,740
I know.

2661
02:07:48,740 --> 02:07:49,740
I mentioned it today.

2662
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:52,100
I was like, man, I should play a little bit, because I saw it when I was looking at the

2663
02:07:52,100 --> 02:07:53,100
roster.

2664
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:57,980
I'm like, I have Little Big Planet 3 sitting in my library, and I have yet to play it.

2665
02:07:57,980 --> 02:08:00,460
I think I played Little Big Planet 2.

2666
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:02,340
I think I did.

2667
02:08:02,340 --> 02:08:10,140
But what's interesting is that there is not, I don't believe it was noted, Super Metroid

2668
02:08:10,140 --> 02:08:11,140
is not there.

2669
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:12,140
Super Metroid, that's kind of the point.

2670
02:08:12,140 --> 02:08:15,140
But the last day, check out this lineup for the last day.

2671
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:16,140
You ready for this?

2672
02:08:16,140 --> 02:08:19,700
Dark Soccer is going to wake up at 6 a.m. on the last day, Saturday.

2673
02:08:19,700 --> 02:08:20,700
Why?

2674
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:21,700
Because that's the Mass Effect speed run.

2675
02:08:22,220 --> 02:08:26,540
No, I'm not going to watch a speed run of a game that I enjoy for the story.

2676
02:08:26,540 --> 02:08:27,540
What a spoilsport.

2677
02:08:27,540 --> 02:08:33,380
I do want to see, and I watched it last year in the archives or whatever, the random...

2678
02:08:33,380 --> 02:08:34,820
Yeah, you can always watch it on YouTube.

2679
02:08:34,820 --> 02:08:40,940
The random item, Link to the Past run, where they shuffle all the items in the game.

2680
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:42,060
But check out this closing day.

2681
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:49,020
Mass Effect, Warcraft 3 through the Human Campaign, Diablo playing a sorcerer, Baldur's

2682
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:55,660
Gate 2, Bloodborne, Final Fantasy IV, Zelda Link to the Past, Mario World, and then lastly

2683
02:08:55,660 --> 02:09:00,940
the big finale tonight, or the last night, Zelda Breath of the Wild.

2684
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:02,580
So there you go.

2685
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:04,340
And then who knows whatever little surprises may...

2686
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:07,460
The Breath of the Wild one's going to be 13 minutes.

2687
02:09:07,460 --> 02:09:08,980
No, I think they...

2688
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:09,980
I think...

2689
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:12,540
Unless they're saying that you have to do a certain amount of stuff, but the...

2690
02:09:12,540 --> 02:09:14,060
Yeah, I think it's a certain amount of stuff.

2691
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:18,980
But the, I think the world record right now for Breath of the Wild is like 10 minutes.

2692
02:09:18,980 --> 02:09:21,380
They're anticipating three hours for that run, so...

2693
02:09:21,380 --> 02:09:27,420
So they must be doing like all the shrines or something.

2694
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:28,420
Yeah.

2695
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:32,660
And I noticed in chat over at live.vognetware.com, Rock Hat says, I hate speedruns, but I do

2696
02:09:32,660 --> 02:09:34,220
laugh at speedrun fails.

2697
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:36,620
Well, they've had a few fails through this whole thing.

2698
02:09:36,620 --> 02:09:39,580
And even if you hate speedruns, I mean, it is for a good cause.

2699
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:43,900
So it's, you know, it's for the Prevent Cancer Foundation is where all the money is going

2700
02:09:43,900 --> 02:09:45,420
this time around, so...

2701
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:50,140
The things I don't mind about speedruns though, is I love, well, you know, I have a minor

2702
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:53,580
obsession with, with glitches, you know?

2703
02:09:53,580 --> 02:09:57,580
So I like watching the glitches and learning like where people have found the games are

2704
02:09:57,580 --> 02:09:59,060
broken or going out of bounds.

2705
02:09:59,060 --> 02:10:05,200
Well, I mean, that's what I was doing in WoW, remember when I got my, my Demon Hunter?

2706
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:09,940
I was going in all the old dungeons and exploring and posting screenshots and stuff.

2707
02:10:09,940 --> 02:10:10,980
I love doing that.

2708
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:16,500
I like people that really work hard at these obscure fucking games.

2709
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:20,500
Like people that'll be like, I can speedrun such and such on the 3DO or something where

2710
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:22,340
it's like, you're probably the only person in the world.

2711
02:10:22,340 --> 02:10:23,940
I'm the expert at running Pepsi man.

2712
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:24,940
Yeah, exactly.

2713
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:25,940
But there's people like that.

2714
02:10:25,940 --> 02:10:28,740
Like I've, I've watched some of these people that are really into these like obscure ass

2715
02:10:28,740 --> 02:10:29,740
games.

2716
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:30,740
And I think that like, I like that.

2717
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:33,300
I like watching them talking about the history of the game and stuff like that.

2718
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:35,180
And they talk about like why they like the game so much.

2719
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:37,040
There's usually some kind of history behind it.

2720
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:38,580
That's the stuff I really like.

2721
02:10:38,620 --> 02:10:41,500
I actually am not as, but you'd be surprised.

2722
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:46,060
The Super Metroid running thing is kind of, I, I don't get quite the same thrill out of

2723
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:47,260
that as maybe the first time I saw it.

2724
02:10:47,260 --> 02:10:50,380
I want to see a speedrun of Magic Pen Jell.

2725
02:10:50,380 --> 02:10:52,380
Hah!

2726
02:10:52,380 --> 02:10:55,940
Maybe, maybe you need to be the one to learn Magic Pen Jell.

2727
02:10:55,940 --> 02:10:56,940
Oh my god.

2728
02:10:56,940 --> 02:10:57,940
All phallic mode.

2729
02:10:57,940 --> 02:10:58,940
All phallic.

2730
02:10:58,940 --> 02:10:59,940
Yes.

2731
02:10:59,940 --> 02:11:03,940
For those who don't remember, which I would think that game is eligible to be Classic

2732
02:11:03,940 --> 02:11:04,940
Game of the Week now.

2733
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:05,940
But anyway, just saying.

2734
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:13,100
Magic Pen Jell was like a Pokemon-ish game on Sony, but you drew all the characters in

2735
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:14,100
like 3D.

2736
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:18,460
Yeah, you drew your characters sort of in 3D and it was basically, depending on what

2737
02:11:18,460 --> 02:11:19,460
colors you used.

2738
02:11:19,460 --> 02:11:21,100
Dicks, dicks, dicks, and more dicks.

2739
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:22,140
That's all anybody ever drew.

2740
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:25,000
Whatever colors you used, you gave you different abilities and stuff.

2741
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:29,740
And so you could just draw like a big ugly blotch of something and it'd be like the most

2742
02:11:29,740 --> 02:11:30,740
powerful thing ever.

2743
02:11:30,740 --> 02:11:31,740
Exactly.

2744
02:11:31,740 --> 02:11:35,860
But yes, usually it was just drawing dongs, lots of dongs, dongs everywhere.

2745
02:11:35,860 --> 02:11:42,500
I think we had like a 2DX controller that was a character one time, but mainly dongs.

2746
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:43,500
Oh yeah.

2747
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:46,860
Yeah, I think somebody made like a 2DX controller or something as a Pokemon.

2748
02:11:46,860 --> 02:11:48,660
Just all these silly things.

2749
02:11:48,660 --> 02:11:51,460
So anyway, Magic Pen Jell.

2750
02:11:51,460 --> 02:11:54,180
That's a game that needs to be, that's the game I want to see a remaster for.

2751
02:11:54,180 --> 02:11:55,980
Who made Magic Pen Jell?

2752
02:11:55,980 --> 02:11:56,980
I don't remember.

2753
02:11:56,980 --> 02:11:57,980
They did a sequel.

2754
02:11:57,980 --> 02:11:58,980
It was called Graffiti Kingdom.

2755
02:11:58,980 --> 02:12:01,340
That was like a brawler stuff.

2756
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:02,900
Brawler type game.

2757
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:06,220
But I don't remember the company that made it.

2758
02:12:06,220 --> 02:12:08,300
Hold on, I'm looking it up.

2759
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:09,300
I know, I'm looking right now.

2760
02:12:09,300 --> 02:12:10,300
It was...

2761
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:11,300
Taito.

2762
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:12,300
Taito, yeah.

2763
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:14,020
Taito published it in Japan.

2764
02:12:14,020 --> 02:12:15,020
And H2...

2765
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:16,020
Garakuta Studio.

2766
02:12:16,020 --> 02:12:17,020
Yeah.

2767
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:18,020
505 Games.

2768
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:21,900
The original name was called Doodle Kingdom.

2769
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:24,580
Well, Rakugaya Okoku.

2770
02:12:24,580 --> 02:12:25,580
I made a doodle.

2771
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:27,540
Hey, uh, phone lines are open by the way.

2772
02:12:27,540 --> 02:12:28,540
You can give us a call.

2773
02:12:28,540 --> 02:12:31,580
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you'd like to give us a call.

2774
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:34,660
If you want to do it the old school way, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2775
02:12:34,660 --> 02:12:36,300
But Orange Lounge Radio on Skype should be the preferred one.

2776
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:38,260
Look at that, third picture in Graffiti Kingdom.

2777
02:12:38,260 --> 02:12:41,420
Already found a dick wearing a top hat.

2778
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:46,140
Ah, internet, you don't let me down.

2779
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:48,780
That would be Sir John Thomas to you.

2780
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:53,540
It's actually Chody is his name.

2781
02:12:53,540 --> 02:12:55,540
Lord.

2782
02:12:55,540 --> 02:12:56,540
Write that down.

2783
02:12:56,540 --> 02:12:57,540
Someone call.

2784
02:12:57,540 --> 02:13:00,420
Whenever we get into that Orange Lounge Radio charity stream we've been talking about for

2785
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:01,420
years.

2786
02:13:01,420 --> 02:13:02,860
Magic Pen Gel needs to be the kick off game.

2787
02:13:02,860 --> 02:13:03,860
For sure.

2788
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:04,860
For sure.

2789
02:13:04,860 --> 02:13:08,660
Uh, again, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the old school way to do it.

2790
02:13:08,660 --> 02:13:12,940
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you'd like to give us a call.

2791
02:13:12,940 --> 02:13:17,340
And apparently, somebody's trying to call us and it says we're unavailable.

2792
02:13:17,340 --> 02:13:18,340
That's not good.

2793
02:13:18,340 --> 02:13:20,980
Let me see if I can do it on my phone just to make sure everything's working.

2794
02:13:20,980 --> 02:13:23,880
Because Bobby called us earlier and that worked.

2795
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:25,900
So I think the connection's working.

2796
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:29,820
But then again, Skype can kind of be a pain in the butt sometimes.

2797
02:13:29,820 --> 02:13:32,380
So I just don't know.

2798
02:13:32,380 --> 02:13:36,300
So if maybe somebody wants to help me fill a little time here while I do a test call.

2799
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:40,340
So as I was talking about the remaster of Burnout Paradise coming out on PlayStation

2800
02:13:40,340 --> 02:13:45,660
4, not only is it rumored to come out on PlayStation 4, but the Xbox One and the Switch.

2801
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:48,440
So you can be playing Burnout Paradise on the Switch.

2802
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:49,440
That's pretty awesome.

2803
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:54,300
Yeah, I just did a test call and it worked.

2804
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:58,620
So yeah.

2805
02:13:58,620 --> 02:13:59,620
Well those of you that...

2806
02:13:59,620 --> 02:14:00,620
I think SSG100...

2807
02:14:00,620 --> 02:14:01,620
So I gotta ask...

2808
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:05,820
Well, Bobby's not calling obviously, but the big thing I've been seeing that a lot of the

2809
02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:11,300
streamers have been playing since it's a really retarded looking Second Life thing is VR chat.

2810
02:14:11,300 --> 02:14:12,300
Oh yes.

2811
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:13,300
I've seen this too.

2812
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:14,300
I've seen some of the YouTubes.

2813
02:14:14,300 --> 02:14:15,300
It looks hilarious.

2814
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:16,300
It looks stupid.

2815
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:17,300
It's some of the worst.

2816
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:18,300
It's dumb.

2817
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:24,500
Yeah, a lot of the stuff I've seen is the worst parts of gaming all in one little...

2818
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:26,380
Let them all live on VR chat island.

2819
02:14:26,380 --> 02:14:27,380
That's fine.

2820
02:14:27,380 --> 02:14:28,380
But I find...

2821
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:31,300
Any new technology that comes out.

2822
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:33,940
It's like we were just talking about Magic Pen Gel.

2823
02:14:33,940 --> 02:14:37,300
Here's a pen so you can draw whatever you want.

2824
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:39,460
Chodymon is the first thing I'm going to draw.

2825
02:14:39,460 --> 02:14:44,940
Like that's the thing is that you introduce society to a new technology and inevitably

2826
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:46,740
the first place you're going to take it is the gutter.

2827
02:14:46,740 --> 02:14:49,420
But those people are always going to draw dicks no matter what it is.

2828
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:52,340
They're always going to draw dicks, their name's always going to be Chody.

2829
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:53,460
It doesn't matter.

2830
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:54,980
That's that person's thing.

2831
02:14:54,980 --> 02:14:57,860
But then there are people that are like, I'm always going to create a Gundam.

2832
02:14:57,860 --> 02:15:00,100
I'm always going to create Hatsune Miku.

2833
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:07,020
I'm going to do whatever and I'm fine with that.

2834
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:08,780
It was just, it was really dumb.

2835
02:15:08,780 --> 02:15:10,020
But I watched it the other day.

2836
02:15:10,020 --> 02:15:11,620
It's just, it was so dumb.

2837
02:15:11,620 --> 02:15:12,620
It was hilarious.

2838
02:15:12,620 --> 02:15:14,580
So it's like memes all over the place.

2839
02:15:14,580 --> 02:15:16,780
Azzette in chat said rule 34 Rob.

2840
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:17,780
Yeah, that's true.

2841
02:15:17,780 --> 02:15:18,780
That's true.

2842
02:15:18,780 --> 02:15:24,380
Bobby Blackwell says it's not easy to create things for VR chat.

2843
02:15:24,380 --> 02:15:26,100
It looks hilarious though.

2844
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:27,340
Okay.

2845
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:28,340
We do have a call coming in.

2846
02:15:28,340 --> 02:15:30,260
I think this guy got his Skype issues resolved.

2847
02:15:30,260 --> 02:15:32,540
So I think we can talk to him higher on orange on radio.

2848
02:15:32,540 --> 02:15:33,540
Who's this?

2849
02:15:33,540 --> 02:15:34,540
Hey guys, it's us.

2850
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:35,540
You're on your mat.

2851
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:36,540
Hey buddy.

2852
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:37,540
I was hoping you'd call in.

2853
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:39,740
Cause you are fresh back from magfest.

2854
02:15:39,740 --> 02:15:40,740
Aren't you?

2855
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:41,740
Yeah.

2856
02:15:41,740 --> 02:15:45,740
I just got back about two hours ago and that was a long drive from what I remember.

2857
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:50,300
Magfest is different from most cons I go to because the last day is like super cut short.

2858
02:15:50,300 --> 02:15:52,140
Like they, they pull the plugs at noon or something.

2859
02:15:52,140 --> 02:15:53,140
Right?

2860
02:15:53,140 --> 02:15:54,140
Like it's, it's over.

2861
02:15:54,140 --> 02:15:55,140
Yeah.

2862
02:15:55,180 --> 02:16:00,620
I was in my car and driving at one o'clock didn't get home until, yeah, not that long

2863
02:16:00,620 --> 02:16:01,620
ago.

2864
02:16:01,620 --> 02:16:02,620
So, well, how was it?

2865
02:16:02,620 --> 02:16:07,420
I know magfest had a lot of, it had a lot of issues with the hotel and all that stuff.

2866
02:16:07,420 --> 02:16:09,700
People worried they wouldn't find a place to park.

2867
02:16:09,700 --> 02:16:12,620
How did it all work out when she got there?

2868
02:16:12,620 --> 02:16:19,040
Once it was there, you know, it kind of just felt like any other magfest.

2869
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:21,020
Things were a little bit different.

2870
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:25,980
Hotels, it seemed like for the most part for me, like I managed to get a room at the

2871
02:16:25,980 --> 02:16:26,980
Gaylord.

2872
02:16:26,980 --> 02:16:27,980
Lucky enough.

2873
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:32,260
If you feel a little guilty about it, but cause so many people didn't, but.

2874
02:16:32,260 --> 02:16:33,460
No, you shouldn't.

2875
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:35,180
You've been, you've been promoting me.

2876
02:16:35,180 --> 02:16:37,020
You're one of the people that got me to go to magfest.

2877
02:16:37,020 --> 02:16:39,980
You, you're, you're, you're just as worthy as some other guy of getting the, uh.

2878
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:40,980
That's true.

2879
02:16:40,980 --> 02:16:46,580
But you know, like I have several friends who like had to drive like 45 minutes to and

2880
02:16:46,580 --> 02:16:49,020
from and like some people like had to take an Uber.

2881
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:50,300
That's, that's such a pain.

2882
02:16:50,300 --> 02:16:54,660
And I get it like the Gaylord in, and if you don't know this venue, cause it's over out

2883
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:58,700
in the Washington DC area, it's technically National Harbor, Maryland, but um, you know,

2884
02:16:58,700 --> 02:17:00,620
they, they do big political events there.

2885
02:17:00,620 --> 02:17:05,620
Like I seem to remember like a week after the last magfest that I went to.

2886
02:17:05,620 --> 02:17:07,980
It's like CPAC is, is in the grand ballroom.

2887
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:08,980
Yeah.

2888
02:17:08,980 --> 02:17:14,340
Like, uh, 45 was there doing a speech or something and it was all over CNN and I was like, oh,

2889
02:17:14,340 --> 02:17:15,340
that's weird.

2890
02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:16,340
Cause I was just there at that same hotel.

2891
02:17:16,340 --> 02:17:17,540
But anyway, it's a gorgeous hotel.

2892
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:19,860
So it's like, once you get to the venue, it's great.

2893
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:22,700
But the problem with National Harbor is it's like super isolated cause it kind of like

2894
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:26,700
sticks out into the, you know, there's only like a couple of roads in and out of there.

2895
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:27,700
Yep, exactly.

2896
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:31,980
And yeah, no, it's just like it's, it was so cold this year.

2897
02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:32,980
Oh yeah.

2898
02:17:32,980 --> 02:17:38,780
Cause we just managed to manage to avoid that big snow bomb, whatever it's called.

2899
02:17:38,780 --> 02:17:39,780
Oh yeah.

2900
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:41,260
It was still like negative.

2901
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:43,420
The bomb cyclone or whatever they're calling it.

2902
02:17:43,420 --> 02:17:44,420
Yeah.

2903
02:17:44,420 --> 02:17:46,380
So then it was still like minus five outside.

2904
02:17:46,380 --> 02:17:48,300
Oh, I'm kind of.

2905
02:17:48,340 --> 02:17:51,060
In that regard, I'm kind of glad I skipped this year.

2906
02:17:51,060 --> 02:17:54,960
You do remember though, because I remember you gave me mad props because I was out there

2907
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:57,940
doing Ingress missions in 20 degree weather last year.

2908
02:17:57,940 --> 02:17:58,940
Yeah.

2909
02:17:58,940 --> 02:17:59,940
You don't know.

2910
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:04,420
But you know, I didn't, I didn't, I miss, I messed up my streak so bad in Pokemon Go

2911
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:07,300
this weekend cause I did not want to go outside.

2912
02:18:07,300 --> 02:18:10,900
I'm surprised there weren't a million pokey things going on in the hotel.

2913
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:13,580
I thought I remember there were a lot of, um, at least Ingress things.

2914
02:18:13,580 --> 02:18:15,700
Oh, pokey things happened in the hotel.

2915
02:18:16,460 --> 02:18:20,500
Actually, I think my Gyarados is from National Harbor.

2916
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:21,500
No, no.

2917
02:18:21,500 --> 02:18:22,780
I was just like, you know what?

2918
02:18:22,780 --> 02:18:27,380
It's just one of those things that I neglected to flip on cause I was so busy doing other

2919
02:18:27,380 --> 02:18:28,380
things.

2920
02:18:28,380 --> 02:18:29,380
That's fair.

2921
02:18:29,380 --> 02:18:30,380
Well, let's talk about those other things a little bit.

2922
02:18:30,380 --> 02:18:34,660
So I know there was some controversy about Tokyo Attack no longer doing the video game

2923
02:18:34,660 --> 02:18:35,660
room.

2924
02:18:35,660 --> 02:18:38,660
I don't know if they worked that out or what, but the arcade room kind of looks like it

2925
02:18:38,660 --> 02:18:40,660
was, it was all right after all, right?

2926
02:18:40,660 --> 02:18:41,660
Yeah, no.

2927
02:18:41,660 --> 02:18:45,220
Um, well they did not work out their dispute with Tokyo Attack.

2928
02:18:45,740 --> 02:18:51,420
They managed to, I don't know who it was, but they managed to meet up with another Tokyo

2929
02:18:51,420 --> 02:18:57,860
Attack-like group and so they had just, you know, the big concern was with Tokyo Attack

2930
02:18:57,860 --> 02:19:06,420
who handles a lot of the Japanese, um, music games and, and a lot of like other Japan games

2931
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:09,060
that have been at like a lot of other magfests.

2932
02:19:09,060 --> 02:19:12,180
So they were, a lot of people were concerned like there's not going to be any DDR, there's

2933
02:19:12,180 --> 02:19:13,820
not going to be Poppin.

2934
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:19,260
They managed to find someone else, I don't know who, who it is, and they managed to bring

2935
02:19:19,260 --> 02:19:21,500
in a lot of those machines.

2936
02:19:21,500 --> 02:19:23,180
So like it wasn't really missed.

2937
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:27,340
There was a ton of DDR machines, they still had UB, they still had some of the newer stuff.

2938
02:19:27,340 --> 02:19:31,180
They didn't have all the new stuff, but they still had a pretty darn good share of it.

2939
02:19:31,180 --> 02:19:35,220
So, you know, they did, you know, so they found a new partner and a lot of chatters

2940
02:19:35,220 --> 02:19:38,540
pointing out that Tokyo Attack is actually at Awesome Games Done Quick right now.

2941
02:19:38,540 --> 02:19:42,300
So, and I think, I feel like they were doing that before anyway, even when they were doing

2942
02:19:42,300 --> 02:19:46,900
Magfest, they kind of packed all that shit up and, because what is, is Awesome Games

2943
02:19:46,900 --> 02:19:49,420
Done Quick still just on the other side of town right now?

2944
02:19:49,420 --> 02:19:50,420
It is.

2945
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:54,660
And it's actually, it's in the same hotel where the original Magfest was, I believe.

2946
02:19:54,660 --> 02:19:55,660
Oh shit.

2947
02:19:55,660 --> 02:19:56,660
Okay.

2948
02:19:56,660 --> 02:20:01,140
So, you know, it's like, so like you have like a lot of, there were like, um, there

2949
02:20:01,140 --> 02:20:04,740
were like a lot of like speed runners who are at Magfest as well.

2950
02:20:04,740 --> 02:20:09,660
So like there were a couple like Mega Man speed runners who were doing the Mega Manathon,

2951
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:15,260
which is a big speed run marathon that they do at Magfest where they go through all the

2952
02:20:15,260 --> 02:20:17,100
Mega Man games and speed run them.

2953
02:20:17,100 --> 02:20:23,220
And then there was a popular Kingdom Hearts speed runner who did his own thing.

2954
02:20:23,220 --> 02:20:26,580
I'm not surprised some people make a really long week of it, although that's a long time

2955
02:20:26,580 --> 02:20:30,300
to be away, but for students and stuff, it might be a little easier to swing that sort

2956
02:20:30,300 --> 02:20:31,300
of time away.

2957
02:20:31,300 --> 02:20:34,180
I heard they made some changes to the concert hall this year.

2958
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:36,260
Did you like the new layout?

2959
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:37,260
They did.

2960
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:38,260
The layout was a bit different.

2961
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:42,700
I mean, so to kind of give everybody some context, the original layout for the main

2962
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:47,580
concert room was they had two stages on opposite ends of this big hall.

2963
02:20:47,580 --> 02:20:54,460
So that way, in their mind, was to kind of set up one concert while the other one was

2964
02:20:54,460 --> 02:20:56,540
still going on.

2965
02:20:56,540 --> 02:21:03,460
The problems you kind of run into is that the bands were able to set up, but the, I

2966
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:08,460
guess, the sound crew, they weren't able to do sound checks properly.

2967
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:11,340
So they managed to just consolidate into one big stage.

2968
02:21:11,340 --> 02:21:15,260
Oh, I remember the sound issues being a problem last year, too.

2969
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:16,660
So this was their solution.

2970
02:21:16,660 --> 02:21:18,320
Okay, that makes sense then.

2971
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:26,320
So things kind of ran a lot more efficiently and also just, you know, the quality was better.

2972
02:21:26,320 --> 02:21:33,240
So there were maybe slightly fewer concerts this year, but on the upside, every single

2973
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:37,280
concert started on time, every single concert pretty much ended on time.

2974
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:38,800
That is good.

2975
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:41,520
So everything just kind of worked out a bit smoother there.

2976
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:45,240
So they didn't switch, did they switch the orientation of the room where like the one

2977
02:21:45,240 --> 02:21:48,960
stage was in the center of where it was before, or did they just use one side and that was

2978
02:21:48,960 --> 02:21:49,960
it?

2979
02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:52,320
They used the more centered part of it.

2980
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:53,320
Okay, interesting.

2981
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:54,760
So it kind of looks like they rotated the room.

2982
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:56,760
That would be kind of interesting.

2983
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:57,760
Yeah.

2984
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:05,280
The BF enough, for the most part, MagFest was pretty much about the same.

2985
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:07,600
Well, that's good.

2986
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:08,600
What was the...

2987
02:22:08,600 --> 02:22:09,600
We're still...

2988
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:10,600
Go ahead.

2989
02:22:10,600 --> 02:22:11,600
You first.

2990
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:12,600
Oh.

2991
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:18,360
So like, well, some of the negatives were like it was noticeably crowded.

2992
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:26,900
It was extremely crowded, especially Friday evenings and all of Saturday.

2993
02:22:26,900 --> 02:22:31,840
So they might have hit their capacity, did they claim a sellout or no?

2994
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:38,040
They did not, but I'm curious because I think like a lot of people, like in the weeks leading

2995
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:43,140
up to MagFest, the months, a lot of people were selling their badges because they couldn't

2996
02:22:43,140 --> 02:22:45,840
make it, because they couldn't get a room.

2997
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:51,160
So I don't know, like it may have been like a lot of local people, a lot of...

2998
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:57,240
But it was like a lot of people, like the past couple of days, the last day or two was...

2999
02:22:57,240 --> 02:23:03,220
There was their first MagFest, because they heard it was kind of like a big party, so...

3000
02:23:03,220 --> 02:23:04,720
Place to go drink.

3001
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:09,760
So what was the coolest thing you saw at MagFest?

3002
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:14,640
Coolest thing I saw was I was able to only catch a little bit of it, because timing and

3003
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:15,640
panels and everything.

3004
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:17,920
So the old show Nick Arcade...

3005
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:18,920
Oh yeah, I heard about this.

3006
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:19,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3007
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:20,920
Yeah.

3008
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:30,640
They managed to get Phil Moore, the original host of Nick Arcade.

3009
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:36,360
So they kind of did their own version of Nick Arcade with a couple of the indie games as

3010
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:38,320
kind of like the game challenges.

3011
02:23:38,320 --> 02:23:39,320
Smart.

3012
02:23:39,320 --> 02:23:41,080
So that was kind of cool.

3013
02:23:41,080 --> 02:23:47,800
So they did that last year, but it didn't really like work out too well.

3014
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:52,760
But they had Phil Moore this year do it, and they did two showings.

3015
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:59,120
They did one with contestants from the crowd, and second night was special guests.

3016
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:03,160
They had Freddie Wong on there doing it as well.

3017
02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:04,380
So it was...

3018
02:24:04,380 --> 02:24:06,480
He kind of just didn't skip a beat.

3019
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:11,720
Was it like seeing the same guy from the 90s television, just right there in person?

3020
02:24:11,720 --> 02:24:12,720
That's awesome.

3021
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:21,960
It was down to him making songs or spitting rhymes during the musical segments, if you

3022
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:23,640
can kind of remember, during the show.

3023
02:24:23,640 --> 02:24:24,640
Yeah, I do.

3024
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:25,640
I do.

3025
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:26,640
I love it.

3026
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:32,440
So one more question I have for you, and then we'll let you go see if we get any other calls.

3027
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:38,000
As has been pointed out a couple of times, it was noted that the gentleman who invented

3028
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:43,160
the Colossus roar, the infamous roar that happens at MAGFest, which kind of sounds like

3029
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:48,480
roar, roar, like a lot of people, and it gets louder and louder as more people join in.

3030
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:53,360
And truth be told, I kind of get annoyed with it by the last day of MAGFest.

3031
02:24:53,360 --> 02:24:58,960
However, seeing that there's a little more sentimentalness to it this year, I probably

3032
02:24:58,960 --> 02:25:04,220
would have made it the whole MAGFest and just silently nodded, what have you.

3033
02:25:04,220 --> 02:25:06,280
But the guy passed away.

3034
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:14,840
So was the Colossus Roars in full force this year because of that?

3035
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:21,360
So on the machine that was his, they had a dedication and everything of him, and apparently

3036
02:25:21,360 --> 02:25:23,400
Stan Lee had signed the cabinet as well.

3037
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:24,400
What?

3038
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:25,400
What?

3039
02:25:25,400 --> 02:25:26,400
Oh, that's cool.

3040
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:27,400
Yeah.

3041
02:25:27,400 --> 02:25:32,680
But no, I think there were a bunch, just kind of like the usual amount.

3042
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:33,680
All right.

3043
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:34,680
So the usual amount, which is lots.

3044
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:40,320
And I think people were able to kind of find out what the actual full story of it was now,

3045
02:25:40,320 --> 02:25:43,240
because where it came from, why people do it.

3046
02:25:43,240 --> 02:25:44,240
Exactly.

3047
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:47,400
And that was kind of my point, where it's like, well, now that I know the story, it's

3048
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:49,800
harder to be annoyed with it.

3049
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:50,800
You know what I mean?

3050
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:56,080
And to kind of quickly tell it for context to everybody who's listening, the story behind

3051
02:25:56,080 --> 02:26:01,360
it is when they first started doing MAGFest, they had a couple of arcade machines, and

3052
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:07,540
one of the big things that they got was the 6-man X-Men arcade machine.

3053
02:26:07,540 --> 02:26:13,480
And the machine's volume was turned up all the way, so during the whole show, anybody

3054
02:26:13,480 --> 02:26:20,480
who's doing Colossus' super, you get the roar, constantly going.

3055
02:26:20,480 --> 02:26:25,040
So that became kind of like the battle cry of MAGFest.

3056
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:28,000
Well, there's the story.

3057
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Yeah?

3058
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Yeah.

3059
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,000
All right.

3060
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:35,040
We're gonna let you go see if we get any other calls in here, but thanks so much for the call. I appreciate it

3061
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:39,120
Yep, you're welcome. All right. Go on. Take care of my friend. Yep. Bye. Bye

3062
02:26:40,060 --> 02:26:46,600
Yeah, Bobby black wolf and chat points out everybody everybody at magfest heard it all 1,000 attendees. That's why it's so iconic

3063
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:48,600
Yeah, well, it's hard to get away from that

3064
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:52,200
Colossus for let's get into some other calls here at chat

3065
02:26:53,560 --> 02:26:58,880
Including this call. Hi, you're on orange on radio. Who's this? What's going on people? It's Ron man. Happy new year

3066
02:26:58,880 --> 02:27:01,660
Hey, Rama, happy new year. It's great to hear from you. What's on your mind?

3067
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:13,560
From a con freezing my butt off these cold winds, but since we're talking magfest

3068
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:18,580
Yeah, let me tell you what really happened with Tokyo attack. Oh

3069
02:27:19,420 --> 02:27:26,200
Okay. Sure cuz I found this out through some staffers. Um, cuz right here in New York

3070
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:33,960
We have like the underground staffing network, which is a combination of con staffers between several conventions in this area

3071
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:40,360
I am out at a party having a good time reconnecting with some people and a few people are asking me about

3072
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:48,420
Magfest I'm like, I'm not going because of the BS with the tickets and I'll tell I'm like I'll deal with it the following year

3073
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:55,720
And during the conversation I found out what really happened with Tokyo attack per se

3074
02:27:56,920 --> 02:27:58,920
Whatever they were arguing about

3075
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:07,200
That's what it was. It seems that a bunch of arcade collectors stepped up and said

3076
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:10,320
Y'all don't need Tokyo attack. We got this

3077
02:28:12,480 --> 02:28:15,340
Interesting so somebody kind of basically made in and made a counteroffer

3078
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:20,400
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I don't remember full details that but I do know

3079
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:28,740
From this point on when you go to mag fest now, you see all these arcade machines. These are from people's personal collections

3080
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:34,720
Well to be fair, you know and we are hearing from SSU 100 Matt who said, you know

3081
02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:36,580
The arcade room was still fine, you know

3082
02:28:36,580 --> 02:28:39,880
And somebody it was either him or Ziba sent me a picture of an f-zero

3083
02:28:40,200 --> 02:28:42,840
Ax machine which there wasn't even that many of those in the u.s

3084
02:28:42,840 --> 02:28:46,000
To begin with so the fact that they have one of those at mag fest was pretty impressive

3085
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:49,040
So, you know mag fest arcade they did fine for themselves

3086
02:28:49,320 --> 02:28:54,840
And we know the Tokyo attack had plenty of time to set up and do a good show over awesome games done quick

3087
02:28:54,840 --> 02:28:58,880
So is this just maybe a everybody wins scenario? I

3088
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:01,320
Tend to think so

3089
02:29:01,320 --> 02:29:06,400
But given some of the stuff that I've been talking with a lot of staffers and non staffers

3090
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:10,960
I mean if you're going to tell the story at least kind of tell it right

3091
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:12,240
Okay

3092
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:16,440
Well, you know but some some of it's a little bit drama and it's like, you know what?

3093
02:29:16,440 --> 02:29:19,840
That's why I'm trying to focus on is everybody happy. Yes. Okay, great

3094
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:28,360
Yeah, well that's good well what so you say do you said you went to a convention this weekend yes

3095
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:36,320
Understand I have a soft spot for little local college conventions and I love them sure

3096
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:38,400
Little conventions to

3097
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:41,760
Yeah

3098
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:47,880
We went me and Marco are we went to this Conco Katori car at a local college campus

3099
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:56,960
They have like a little Friday get-together. Then the actual cars in three buildings on the campus and normally it's

3100
02:29:57,560 --> 02:29:59,280
in January

3101
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:05,680
So you don't expect to walk around in the cold weather switching between buildings

3102
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:08,320
I

3103
02:30:08,440 --> 02:30:10,440
Are yeah

3104
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:15,440
And you were posting about stuff that was going on at sac anime all the way out here

3105
02:30:15,440 --> 02:30:20,920
That's kind of what made me laugh as I was like, wow, Sammy's getting big enough to where this it's not

3106
02:30:21,880 --> 02:30:23,880
It's more like what?

3107
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:26,720
I guess it is a lot of

3108
02:30:26,880 --> 02:30:34,100
Obviously a lot of fucking bullshit going on in the communities and there's a lot of people who look at me as some type of

3109
02:30:34,900 --> 02:30:40,620
Mystical sage who can handle business the most that I can do is pay it forward

3110
02:30:40,620 --> 02:30:45,780
You know sac anime thing was there was some creeper taking upskirt shots. Oh gross

3111
02:30:46,820 --> 02:30:52,460
Might be the best I can do is tag friends who are in the area and pay it forward

3112
02:30:52,460 --> 02:30:56,460
So are you you're being convention daddy looking out for everybody?

3113
02:30:56,460 --> 02:30:58,460
I

3114
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:05,920
Honestly Rob, I've been conned daddy for about the last ten years more or less I have gone to many

3115
02:31:06,860 --> 02:31:10,000
Con raves and met up with my female friends

3116
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:14,720
Which is her who asked me to walk them back to their rooms because they're guys at the rave

3117
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:17,180
Who don't know how to take a hint, you know

3118
02:31:17,180 --> 02:31:21,180
The unfortunate thing about that a-hole that's doing the upskirt pics and all that stuff

3119
02:31:21,180 --> 02:31:25,260
Is that that guy probably don't even watch anime and isn't even a nerd in the slightest sort

3120
02:31:25,260 --> 02:31:27,500
I mean it might be but unfortunately

3121
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:32,060
I think there's just there's just gross people that make their way into because they see opportunity

3122
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:37,780
And it's it's gross and I'm glad that we're coming together as a society to you know

3123
02:31:37,780 --> 02:31:41,480
Put a stop to that shit and you know, we're looking out for each other and you know

3124
02:31:41,480 --> 02:31:46,260
Hopefully if a girl catches him doing that they're gonna fucking speak the fuck up and get that guy

3125
02:31:46,260 --> 02:31:50,820
Booted the fuck out in his phone thrown on the ground and stomped on or whatever. He's using to take the pictures

3126
02:31:50,820 --> 02:31:53,840
And you're absolutely right you read if you go back

3127
02:31:54,900 --> 02:31:58,660
The me to move movement remember sure. Well, how can you forget?

3128
02:31:58,900 --> 02:31:59,780
Yeah

3129
02:31:59,780 --> 02:32:07,020
It really exploded in the cosplay community because there are a lot of fucking creepers out there who don't know how to say

3130
02:32:07,020 --> 02:32:11,540
No, they do this and they do that and I think I've known people

3131
02:32:11,540 --> 02:32:17,100
I've been connected to people that I have disconnected myself from for their antics. We don't play that shit no more

3132
02:32:17,740 --> 02:32:24,020
Yeah, you know and if you if you see a cute girl at an anime convention dressed up in an outfit

3133
02:32:24,020 --> 02:32:29,260
Why don't you just ask polite or cute guy? Whatever it is. Why don't you just ask politely? Hi

3134
02:32:29,260 --> 02:32:30,900
Can I take your picture, you know?

3135
02:32:30,900 --> 02:32:36,340
Cuz a lot of cosplayers dress up so that they can get their picture taken, but just ask

3136
02:32:37,940 --> 02:32:39,940
But sometimes

3137
02:32:40,420 --> 02:32:42,420
We tend to read the body language

3138
02:32:43,100 --> 02:32:45,240
Assume this or that and fuck it up

3139
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:45,580
Yeah

3140
02:32:45,580 --> 02:32:51,940
Don't never assume anything and and if somebody doesn't want to have their picture taken don't take it as they're a fucking bitch or whatever

3141
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:55,800
It's just you know, I think we've all had this and I've experienced this

3142
02:32:56,020 --> 02:32:57,880
sometimes your days are so

3143
02:32:57,880 --> 02:33:03,860
Fucking long that when you've had it and some people use the analogy of I only have so many spoons for with the mental health

3144
02:33:03,860 --> 02:33:05,860
I can handle so you've probably heard this this story before

3145
02:33:06,580 --> 02:33:12,400
And sometimes people are out and they need a chance to drink their fucking Diet Coke and recharge and then they'll take the picture

3146
02:33:12,420 --> 02:33:14,420
maybe later so

3147
02:33:15,220 --> 02:33:21,860
It's like this sometimes I've been told not right now later and I'm like, oh, here's my card find me later

3148
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:25,660
They usually find me later or the next day and we take pictures here at times

3149
02:33:25,660 --> 02:33:30,060
I take pictures of cosplayers while they're chilling and sitting down. I'm like don't get up. This is fine

3150
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:37,420
Yeah, so just ask and I'm sure you can get lots of pictures with cute girls and guys and people dressed up but

3151
02:33:37,860 --> 02:33:42,020
Appropriately and per their boundaries not yours and also

3152
02:33:42,580 --> 02:33:47,060
Every single every con has this they have a how to talk to

3153
02:33:47,300 --> 02:33:54,780
Con guys and girls panel one-on-one how to talk to them how not to be a creeper almost every con has this panel

3154
02:33:54,780 --> 02:33:57,640
It's an hour out of your out of your con weekend

3155
02:33:58,220 --> 02:34:03,240
Go I was there. I went to that panel today and shared some of my old stories

3156
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:08,900
I'm hoping our listeners. We have a pretty good crowd that doesn't need to hear it. But just in case just in case

3157
02:34:09,880 --> 02:34:15,320
You know that that's out there and there's no shame in attending these panels because Rama went to this panel today to help out

3158
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:21,340
So I'm gonna go you can go my friends was running the pound my guys swing by heard some of the stories

3159
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:26,200
Tell some of my own experiences from both sides. Are we good?

3160
02:34:27,080 --> 02:34:31,860
As Joe and under Matt wanted to follow up since it doesn't relate to your call to a group named snow

3161
02:34:31,880 --> 02:34:34,320
Phoenix was the group that picked up the music game slack

3162
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:38,460
Where'd the void from Tokyo attack was left at magfest. So there you go

3163
02:34:39,960 --> 02:34:45,360
Okay, Rama, I'm gonna let you go cuz the coughing fit means time. Yes, and we will see you at magfest next year, right?

3164
02:34:46,480 --> 02:34:51,160
Assuming I'm gonna use the disclaimer. I'm not putting up with hotel drama and I'm not doing this

3165
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:58,040
I will handle the hotel. It'll be bog winter confest 2019. We're gonna do it up. All right, I

3166
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:05,700
Under those conditions if I can stay in the National Harbor area and I'm even fine walking from one of the other hotels

3167
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:12,720
We're gonna book a room across the street and one of the Swedes mako chan is coming

3168
02:35:12,720 --> 02:35:16,720
She is going to cook like mama Luigi. We're gonna throw down. All right

3169
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:23,160
As then let me follow up with this work you got that right, honey

3170
02:35:25,080 --> 02:35:27,700
Yes, con daddy come through

3171
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:34,320
All right, I'm hanging up take care buddy, bye-bye

3172
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:38,640
All right

3173
02:35:38,640 --> 02:35:45,160
Anyway, uh, let's see Bobby and chat says remember I snore that's okay. I wear mr. Smoosh snores

3174
02:35:45,160 --> 02:35:49,320
So I wear and yes, it's loud because mr. Smoosh likes to sleep right next to my ear

3175
02:35:49,320 --> 02:35:54,040
I wear earplugs, so that stuff actually doesn't bother me as much as you think

3176
02:35:55,160 --> 02:35:59,520
All right. Anyway, but Bobby you don't come cuz this is January anyway, but maybe I don't know

3177
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:03,300
Maybe he maybe he's giving it some thought I don't know but I do want to I do want to make magfest next year happen

3178
02:36:03,300 --> 02:36:06,240
It is a fun convention. So I just I'm like

3179
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:09,560
I'm I am NOT usually despite what?

3180
02:36:10,040 --> 02:36:17,080
Captain Matt on starboard power coupling says I'm not usually the one to break out with ego. However in this circumstance

3181
02:36:18,640 --> 02:36:20,640
I'm gonna be like the whole

3182
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:22,840
Because next year I'll be 40 years old

3183
02:36:22,840 --> 02:36:29,440
So I'm gonna play the whole I am 40 years old and I don't have time to come I flew all the way out here

3184
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:34,360
From the West Coast. I have a podcast. I'm not taking a 45 minute uber ride

3185
02:36:34,760 --> 02:36:40,480
So if I'm going to magfest next year, I'm gonna have a little bit of convenience that's the only way I'm gonna do it

3186
02:36:42,040 --> 02:36:43,840
All right

3187
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:48,240
Anyway, huh? I think it's about time for us to wrap it up here at orange launch radio

We don't ask really for your money to do this program

3197

I'm hopefully gonna play more VR games next week

Because I played one that's one more than I was playing. All right, and dark soccer your final thought tonight
