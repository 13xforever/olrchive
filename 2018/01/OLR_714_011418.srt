00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,960
This week statistics show that the PlayStation 4 is for porn.

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,320
No word on what genres are the favorite per platform, but some things may be better left

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,320
unknown.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,320
This is just one of many headlines, stay tuned for so much more starting right now on the

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,680
show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,200

My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,840

Sakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Sup.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
Hey how you doing?

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm alive.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
I'm here.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
You're kicking, you're good.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,840
I drove myself.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
Yeah, good.

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
I can drive.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
Yay.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,840
I grown up.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
Awesome.

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Hello.

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
And how are you doing?

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,280
Good, I just want to make sure I didn't, oh that's empty anyways.

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,720
What, your In-N-Out cup is where you go tonight?

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,040
So you're one of those Californians who likes In-N-Out because some people-

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,520
I wouldn't say I like In-N-Out, I was driving here, I was like I don't know what I want

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,640
to eat and it was between In-N-Out or El Pollo Loco and I was like I had El Pollo Loco the

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
other day so.

33
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,160
My sister was visiting last night and she's from L.A. and we were kind of talking about

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,240
like In-N-Out and she kind of thinks it's like super overrated and I don't think it's

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,560
like overrated but I do find that like when people from the East Coast come out here it's

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,840
always like okay and one of the things we have to do on the trip, we have to go one

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,880
night to In-N-Out and I'm just like okay it's not that great but I mean it's good, it's

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
cool.

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
It's alright.

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
Yeah.

41
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
I'm not from In-N-Out but I'm not from your country.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,400
I mean from your state.

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,720
There's nice fine dining options down, so we go to an independently owned place.

44
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,000
I mean yeah, you could go to In-N-Out but you could also go to the Sizzler.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,680
Oh that's fine dining.

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,480
Alright anyway I could talk with Jamie and Matt and I will plenty throughout tonight's

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,000
show but we talk to them a lot throughout the other weeks of the show.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,360
We have a lot of guests here in studio tonight and I want to get to them because I've been

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
promoting this for a few weeks now that we were going to be joined by some folks here

50
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,080
locally and we've talked about this on and off on the show a little bit about how a few

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,040
years ago I was reading Joystiq's blog and they're no longer around so I'll tell you

52
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,440
how long ago this was but they were talking about, they ran an article on this brand new

53
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,320
game that had just come out for iPhone that was on Android for a year or two prior and

54
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,720
it was a location based game where you actually played out in the real world with real places

55
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,880
that were near you and this game was called Ingress and so I downloaded it to my phone

56
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,240
and I've regretted that decision for the past four years but I've met some amazing people

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
thanks to the game and some of them are here in studio tonight so I want to introduce you

58
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,960
guys to starting us off tonight Jen how are you doing Jen?

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,080
I'm great how are you?

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
Good it's great to have you here.

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,840
It's great to be here.

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,600
Awesome so I'll introduce everybody real quick and then I'm gonna ask you guys some questions.

63
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,400
So also joining us tonight is Tori.

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,520
Hey how you doing?

65
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,480
Good Tori how you doing?

66
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,680
Good.

67
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,640
Good and then last but not least Snow is joining us tonight.

68
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,240
Hello audience.

69
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,200
Hi you don't normally sound like that.

70
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,160
No I don't sound like that.

71
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,920
No I wish when you played the game and were talking to us over we'll talk about how some

72
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,800
of this works later I wish you would use that voice.

73
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,120
Everybody start your clears.

74
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,000
Everybody get ready to drop those blockers in three two all right.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
Pick up the phone.

76
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,960
All right so I did want to make tonight's show you know I know not everybody out there who

77
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,360
listens to the show plays Ingress.

78
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,880
I know this will be met with some mixed reaction to our crowd here but I know most of our audience

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,520
is super familiar as a lot of gamers are with Pokemon Go which released about a year and

80
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,760
a half ago and Pokemon Go Pokemon goes from the same company that did Ingress and you

81
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,440
may wonder like why are these random parks or why are these things that don't even exist

82
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,760
anymore in my town Pokestops like where did that come from and that was populated from

83
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,920
Ingress which was Niantic's prior game.

84
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,200
Yeah you're welcome Pokemon players.

85
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,000
That's right you're welcome and also sorry.

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,800
Anyway so let's talk about what is Ingress.

87
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,320
So if you guys were to describe Ingress to a new person like you're trying to do like

88
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,600
the sales pitch to try to get somebody to play the game how would you do this?

89
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,040
Jen what what is Ingress?

90
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,720
Well way back when when we all were Pokemon wasn't a thing yet we would call it capture

91
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,760
the flag sort of meets like I don't even know it I forget what we called it geocaching

92
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,080
and so really it's the kind of game that gets you going places seeing things that you didn't

93
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,120
know existed previously and that's kind of the draw for a lot of people is being able

94
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,040
to get out and learn more about their location.

95
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,400
Yeah I have to admit I had a lot of that playing the game you know even in my own neighborhood

96
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,200
I was always taken aback with there's like a ton of churches on this street I never realized

97
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,960
like just how many of them are like hidden.

98
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,320
So so many churches everywhere.

99
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,640
So many churches churches everywhere for sure.

100
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,400
But also lots of statues and parks parks that I like never even knew were around like oh

101
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,800
there's there's a park over here because there's a portal here now now I think oh I'll go back

102
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,960
there someday I never do.

103
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,880
So so so besides the exploration part of the game Tori let me let me call on you for a

104
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
little bit what what is the game element of Ingress?

105
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,880
What is the game part besides just the exploration?

106
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,600
Well the game it's basically two factions so two teams opposing each other and the

107
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,160
overarching goal is to try to cover as much territory as you can and the way you do that

108
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,440
is to create triangles by linking these portals or pokestops together and forming triangles.

109
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,160
Actually I can see the pain in your face when you say the pokey stops.

110
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,720
Yes but your your listeners can't so that's sorry sorry.

111
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,120
Now they can.

112
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,920
So the idea is basically to link those those together and make triangles and cover as much

113
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:22,160
area as possible and it's sounds pretty easy but it can be quite complex because you can

114
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,160
block said triangles by linking other portals together we try to link them together we try

115
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,880
to layer and try to not only cover a particular populated area but cover it with as many layers

116
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:42,160
as possible so you're playing in a in densely populated areas a lot that being said sometimes

117
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,000
you might play in very remote areas and I think that's one of the positives of the game it

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,920
literally can be played anywhere.

119
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,960
Yeah that's that's very true you know even though the triangles in a very rural part

120
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,280
of area like for example we're in Northern California so we'll say like I own okay is

121
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,800
a very remote type of city right.

122
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,760
Or Nevada city.

123
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,640
Or okay oh yeah Nevada city perfect for example is more remote and so when you do a triangle

124
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,000
in Nevada city it's not going to be worth as much as a triangle in downtown San Francisco

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,720
which can be worth a lot more because San Francisco is very populated.

126
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,040
Yeah their cemeteries have more MU than downtown.

127
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,760
Exactly exactly crazy right.

128
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,880
And they're all dead it doesn't seem.

129
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,920
Zombie units ZU I guess is how it works so so sometimes these triangles are very small

130
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,960
but sometimes we work together to make very big ones right yeah.

131
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,640
So Snow and I recently did a very large field over I don't know how many layers we had over

132
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,000
was it like 50 layers over it was it was in the LA area and that required I mean we we

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,640
had hundreds of agents and it was really fun.

134
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,240
And just quickly when you say layers that means like you take one triangle and then

135
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,080
you're putting basically more triangles on top of it by moving one of the ends of the

136
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,360
triangle out slowly.

137
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,320
Yeah exactly.

138
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,040
Across more pokey stops or portals.

139
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,200
Yeah those yeah those yeah yeah.

140
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,720
Stop calling them pokey stops.

141
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
Hopefully the listeners understand at this point.

142
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
We're going to burn this house to the ground.

143
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,960
But you guys so I actually let me let me ask about some of these like big like operations

144
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,840
just to give these guys some perspective the listeners about like well let me actually

145
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,240
let me backtrack let me back to this question for everybody.

146
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,160
How long have you been playing this game?

147
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,480
And I'll start with you Snow how long have you been playing in yours?

148
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,560
Jesus 1042 days my sojourner said so I've hacked the portal every day since I started.

149
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,160
Wow.

150
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Wait was that badge even out when you started though?

151
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,240
Yeah it came out like two weeks before I started.

152
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Okay so you've been playing for 1042 days.

153
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,680
I actually would have thought it was longer.

154
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,320
Tori what about you?

155
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,200
How long have you been playing?

156
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,160
I started playing the day that Robin Williams died which is why my name is Mork from Ork

157
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,680
because he's one of my favorites.

158
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,560
So that would have been I'm looking three and a half years ago.

159
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,920
That's a lovely tribute though.

160
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,440
Yeah I think so too.

161
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,480
What about you Jen?

162
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,240
I started shortly after the game came out so I'm coming up on five years.

163
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,360
How did you find out about it?

164
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,400
Well I actually was dating somebody on the other side who played it to start with and

165
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,400
I didn't play in part because I had an iPhone and they did not have the app for the iPhone

166
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,960
yet.

167
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,800
The only way to play it at that time would have been the illegal you know against TOS

168
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,240
app that people had made but that got you banned pretty quick.

169
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,320
Or you could tether your iPhone to an Android tablet which is what I ended up doing.

170
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,480
And I actually didn't start until after the person I was dating and I had split but a

171
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,040
friend that I had met through him really encouraged me to play and that's how I ended up playing.

172
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,640
And here you are.

173
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,440
And here I am.

174
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,240
All right.

175
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,200
Now to give our listeners an idea about like how you know because this is a lot of people

176
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,920
especially like gamers like most of our audience.

177
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,640
I'm gonna say all but most of our audience is very console based very PC based you know

178
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,880
playing things like you know I don't know Super Mario Odyssey on a console or maybe

179
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,760
something like World of Warcraft or Overwatch on a PC.

180
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,720
So I mean a lot of times people think of mobile games they think about oh Candy Crush or they

181
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,200
think about Pokemon Go or they think about Words with Friends you know these or HQ I

182
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
guess is the big new one right the trivia game show.

183
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,700
Two dots.

184
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:15,540
So I mean Ingress the scale of what is done in this game can really like surprise some

185
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,420
people sometimes right.

186
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,740
So give our listeners an idea.

187
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:24,900
What's like the biggest like accomplishment you've done in Ingress if you can think of

188
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,380
what that is.

189
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,380
What's like the biggest accomplishment you've done in the game.

190
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,260
I definitely have one and then I'll pass it to you Snow.

191
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,980
Okay Jen go ahead.

192
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:38,180
We there the Ingress or the Niantic will actually create sort of challenges.

193
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,380
And there was a challenge to put up a certain amount of MU the thing the amount of people

194
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,540
underneath the triangle large triangle.

195
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,860
And we had a challenge to cover three different places.

196
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,500
And it was just over a couple of days and we ended up being able to field in about 48

197
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:04,100
hours from Big Bend in Texas to Dunsmuir in the top of California up kind of near Weed

198
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,020
and all the way down to I believe it was Baja.

199
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,740
And we pulled that field together in just a few days.

200
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,660
It was like hundreds of agents that we were able to coordinate over four different states

201
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,060
I believe.

202
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,620
So to put this in perspective for our listeners who've never touched Ingress before again

203
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,860
Ingress is a location based game and to do these links and make these triangles you have

204
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,140
to hack these portals.

205
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,420
And so when you hack these portals you might get a key and a key is how you link two portals

206
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,740
together and then if you do a triangle out of your link.

207
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,500
So you helped with this or did you run it?

208
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:38,980
I did.

209
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,180
Okay I designed and ran it.

210
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:46,340
You led an organization to put a triangle with keys from Weed California it's like Mount

211
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,740
Shasta right to Texas to Baja California.

212
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,140
Yes.

213
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,220
And you pulled that together in 48 hours.

214
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,100
Yes it was just maybe a little bit over 48 but yeah.

215
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,500
Well we had some luck things happen.

216
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,540
The big thing is a lot of times you have you send out people too when you know they're

217
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,660
going to go to a certain place and say bring back keys for you know however many you can

218
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,060
get.

219
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,300
And so then the person will sit there and they will hack the portal or they'll you know

220
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,340
spin the pokey spot stop for Pokemon reference.

221
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,460
I don't play Pokemon so that's you know.

222
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,220
And you'll so those people will bring back those keys.

223
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,300
So for Baja you know that's one of those places that we would send somebody kind of regularly.

224
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,780
So we had keys there and Dunsmuir we actually didn't have keys for because we had not really

225
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,500
been there previously for fielding purposes.

226
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,540
But Texas.

227
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,220
Because nobody goes to Dunsmuir.

228
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,660
That's right nobody goes to Dunsmuir.

229
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,820
My dad my dad worked for the railroad he went to Dunsmuir all the time like can you imagine

230
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,020
if I played this I would have made my dad play this game.

231
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,820
You would have had it yeah.

232
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,020
I would have made my dad play this game.

233
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,140
That would have been great.

234
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,940
So but we had the luck of the draw of an agent named Mr. Kent flying into San Francisco from

235
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:02,660
Texas the day that the day before we needed to do the field and he had the Big Ben keys.

236
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,700
So we were able to coordinate people going to Big Bend who actually had Baja keys that

237
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,780
we had previously coordinated sending from with somebody traveling.

238
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,860
So and then Mr. Kent went up to Dunsmuir with us.

239
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,620
And that's how we did it.

240
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,980
That's how we coordinated that quickly.

241
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,540
So and I have to admit like when I first started playing Ingress you know for the first little

242
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,740
while I was a little bit of a loner and I was like okay whatever this is cool.

243
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,180
But then when I started getting exposed to this James Bond shit I was like wow this is

244
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,140
really impressive that it in some ways I almost feel like there's like because I played a

245
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,900
lot of MMOs in the past and I still do.

246
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,100
I play things on Final Fantasy XI, XIV, World of Warcraft and I actually do see some similarities

247
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,740
between World of Warcraft and Ingress right.

248
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,420
You have Horde versus Alliance.

249
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,540
It's a huge fetch quest.

250
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,620
In some ways yeah it's a big fetch quest.

251
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,860
You have Horde there's just no poop quest in Ingress yet.

252
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,780
But you have Horde versus Alliance and especially back in the early days of wow there's a lot

253
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,580
of passion behind that right like you kind of have an Ingress there's a lot of passion

254
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,780
behind the teams in Ingress.

255
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,500
And then you know you might get together and you might go PvP Ingress is a very player

256
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,540
versus player heavy game.

257
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,420
Or you might do this like raid and either you're raiding you know maybe a very for us

258
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,020
because we all play the green team.

259
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:20,020
We're being fair and balanced tonight by the way this is a fair and balanced presentation.

260
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,980
We're all rez players here playing on the green team they're all green.

261
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,140
But well that's you know that's also why we're talking a lot about like very I think everything

262
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,260
we're saying or things that you know rez I think would agree these are the parts of the

263
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,940
game that make it great and so forth.

264
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,060
So but anyway what was I gonna say with that oh and then raids might sometimes be we're

265
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,580
getting a big group of people together between Texas and you know every state in between

266
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:46,020
California to throw a gigantic effing triangle and that's that's just crazy like the lengths

267
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,980
people go to.

268
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,340
What about you Snow I'll check in with you what's your best accomplishment in Ingress

269
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,300
the time you've played?

270
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,500
I haven't murdered anyone.

271
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,540
Have you wanted to?

272
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,040
Yeah.

273
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:02,900
But I haven't like I won I beat I beat Ingress every day so you know.

274
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,620
How do you I didn't think you could beat Ingress I thought it was.

275
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,420
I win every day.

276
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,540
It was the song that never ends.

277
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,660
I managed to hack a portal.

278
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,260
I am proof you can rage quit Ingress.

279
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,580
It's it's like uh.

280
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,620
I haven't rage quit.

281
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,540
You've won by not rage quitting and I've gotten right to that brink where it's like I'm gonna

282
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,900
fucking quit I'm gonna fucking quit this bullshit but then I don't.

283
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,220
I have never wanted to quit.

284
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,660
Then Snow will show up at my house and she slaps me and she says you can't fucking quit.

285
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,780
I say you can quit.

286
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,820
Why would you want to quit?

287
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,700
Snow's not in jail either just throwing that out there.

288
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,100
I'm not in jail I have been super good the mountains have a lot of places to hide bodies

289
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
but I haven't murdered anyone in Ingress.

290
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,020
Okay just saying yeah that's just an Ingress just that's the qualifier.

291
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,060
All right so we have giant triangle and haven't murdered anybody.

292
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,780
Tori what about you what's your best accomplishment in Ingress?

293
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,380
I was gonna say giant triangle but I'm sorry.

294
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,740
Well I did my sack filled largely by myself my very first one which was pretty cool.

295
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:06,740
However one of my favorite moments I think was actually when there was a very large

296
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:14,340
resistance field the other team and I kind of quickly figured out what was up and was able to

297
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:22,580
go to a remote location basically block that field and for me that was kind of cool so it's

298
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,700
kind of the other side of the field I mean the other side of the fence is that you know on the

299
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,500
one hand we're making these triangles but on the other hand part of it is being able to block the

300
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:36,180
other team from from doing the same so that's part of the game and that is really a lot of what I do

301
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,500
and I love it. That's the cloak and dagger shit when you have to be predictive and I'm always

302
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,220
impressed you know having played with you for a while I've been very impressed at your ability to

303
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:51,460
not just call that a field is coming but you could generally you will get like at least two

304
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:58,260
of the three points that they're using. I love you for noticing that but it's true definitely

305
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,580
very good like when Tori says a field's coming like I believe it I do I'm in the car driving

306
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:09,140
a sluice house I am. All right so anyway I do want to introduce our chat room of course over

307
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:15,140
at live.vognetwork.com where we do tape every Sunday night at the voice geeks network vognetwork.com

308
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,220
six o'clock pacific nine o'clock eastern right after the bobby black wolf show and this might

309
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,340
be a familiar name to some of you here in chat we have a set is in chat tonight who's reminding

310
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,980
us that links can't cross each other and that's something we we kind of didn't I don't know if we

311
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,140
said that very clearly but wow is that way to go basic ingress well but it's like it's like

312
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,100
Ghostbusters the streams can't cross but that's important so if you're drawing what happens if

313
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,740
we cross the stream not very bad crazy cat lady has crossed the streams before shout out to Donna

314
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,860
well actually it you you could cross the streams if you throw the links at like the exact same

315
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:56,180
moment and the servers have problems yeah yeah ingress servers have and then there's no never

316
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,220
never and then there always works we do cry actually there's been yeah there's there's

317
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,100
been some crying over fields I'm not gonna lie that fucking blocker in time yeah exactly

318
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,220
uh let's see also in chat at live.vognetwork.com kaijuto in chat says this game sounds cool

319
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,980
I like the espionage aspect oh there is so much espionage speaking from a personal standpoint

320
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,740
that could be the best thing and that could be the worst thing because the worst thing is that

321
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,900
now like when I go into these completely public places and I steep see people staring at their

322
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,900
phones I'm like are they taking the portal are they and that was especially bad a couple years

323
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,060
ago but now it's like even worse because it's like no it's a five-year-old trying to catch a pikachu

324
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:38,500
that was me that was me at Disneyland though okay there is no paranoia like ingress paranoia like

325
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,820
right I don't care how high you are or what drug you're on there is no paranoia that was actually

326
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,620
what led up to my rage quit was at Disneyland and even after you leave the game you still get it

327
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,540
like I saw someone parked next to the church today looking at the hallway I suspect everyone they

328
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:58,980
can't see your face the park near my house what so tell me more about the rage quit I just got

329
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:05,540
really sick of losing like and it actually stemmed from losing my my home portal the the one that was

330
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:11,060
in my neighborhood that I would always walk to and go do and go back home and I was like one day

331
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:16,180
before whatever badge I was getting and someone took it and then I went to Disneyland angry

332
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:22,260
and I would see like other people on resistance playing you know at Disneyland and I'm like

333
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,940
fuck all of you I'm gonna steal them all they're my team that and then goddamn over and says you're

334
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:34,500
here for your birthday chill let's go watch world of color and I didn't pick it up until like what

335
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,540
about two months ago but that is that is one of the hard lessons I think a new player has

336
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:45,140
to learn about Ingress is that nobody owns a portal and I never the same way ever get

337
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:50,980
emotionally yeah don't ever get emotionally I don't give a shit be it just don't because

338
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:56,660
you know some people will use that against you well no just depending on who it is I was mad

339
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,060
this I was a day away from getting my badge uh oh well that's especially why you didn't you know

340
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,500
the only reason I call it mine is because it's in my neighborhood and I'm the only person in

341
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,140
that part of my neighborhood that plays sure but it's not you until you're not anymore because for

342
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,940
the first year and a half it belongs to the I was on a post in this neighborhood and then somebody

343
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,660
hardcore showed up and it's like okay this is just although I am gonna reclaim the one in my

344
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:24,100
work lobby although I do where I work I do like that one that's near my house just happens to be

345
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:30,020
just about uh level five x and p away so they take it all the time and I just ping it every

346
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,620
now then just to wake them up and I know that they have their notifications on because they

347
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:39,140
recharge on portals and I do that in the morning all the time they'll take they'll take a portal

348
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,500
that I can like fire it from my house and then I'll just fire at it all night with the lowest

349
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,300
level one I can reach it with and then like every hour I'll get up and go to the bathroom at two in

350
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:54,980
the morning I'll open Ingress and I'll fire a burster just see what happens and then I convince

351
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,460
hey sorry rez I convinced a rez player to recharge it when it started getting low and bump it and put

352
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,060
an axel on it so it wouldn't go down I just pinged them all the time so let's talk a little

353
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,540
bit about the badge denial thing actually for a minute because this is kind of part of what landed

354
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:14,740
ingress in the news in the gaming community in a wider sense a few weeks ago is that for those that

355
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:20,740
are unaware I guess you could say like achievements like xbox 360 achievements or trophies the ingress

356
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,780
game has badges built into it and the badges might be oh you linked x many links or you fielded this

357
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:31,620
many fields or you covered this many moo or you know or one of them is you held a portal for this

358
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,500
many days and the interesting thing about ingress is that in order to level there's 16 levels in

359
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,460
ingress right so to get from eight to 16 you actually need some of these achievements to level

360
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,900
now tell me about it now are you are you locked behind achievements right now that's where alan's

361
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:53,060
at but in the old school days of ingress like one of the easy achievements that you really needed to

362
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:58,740
get to level 16 was being able to hold a portal for 150 days um i don't think that's not really

363
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,860
the case anymore like especially if you can glyph especially if you play with your team and and work

364
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:10,980
recharge well or sojourner you know uh hacking so many days anyway there's lots of alternatives now

365
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,580
so it's not really the case but yet we still have this issue and where this led into was

366
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:20,900
uh where you probably saw this amongst different blogs out there is there was um our our opposition

367
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:26,740
had a a network called the brokers guild is what it was called it was basically a database that

368
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:32,100
was um scraping what's called the intel i don't even know how you can explain this right scraping

369
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,740
the intel and was showing that let's say it would show uh snow captured x portal on x day and so

370
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,980
they could say you know i am mad at snow i want to go figure out what portal she has them i would

371
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:49,220
take them all out at day 149 so she can't get her on 148 actually day 148 tell tell this story real

372
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:54,500
quick they all they all went out in the snow one day to do it snow to get snow right no they went

373
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:00,420
out to a low signal portal there's three of them because i killed their farm and they drove all

374
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,900
the way up which transparency may or may not have been related to brokers guild we don't know i

375
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:10,260
have to be transparent yeah no i'm well that's how they found it well but allegedly allegedly

376
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,820
yeah allegedly you know who you are i know you three you three know who you are and they went

377
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,020
up there and legit told me that we had a circle jerk near the portal which i thought was a little

378
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:28,660
weird um and tori was with me and we killed the farm and we showed up and i was like oh my god

379
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:34,500
someone killed my guardian and i did a little dance and i was super excited and tori and her

380
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,460
friend were like i am so sorry i was like why are you sorry i made three people drive into the middle

381
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:46,260
of nowhere in low signal to kill a portal they drove 45 50 minutes out of their way while i

382
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:51,460
killed their farm just to take this portal out and then they started laughing i don't i i don't

383
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,220
like the guardian badge i think it's dumb i think that guardian hunting is a dick move but at the

384
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,660
same time i use it to my advantage i'll make these i live really far from people so i put these

385
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:05,300
portals out there and i know they have to go kill them and i know they're in shitty signal and i

386
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,700
know these people have never been there so it's really fun when they pop up to the north of me

387
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,380
and someone goes oh so and so is north what are they doing i go oh they're probably trying to kill

388
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,860
my portal and then i'll just poke at them on com like that took you forever it took me five

389
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,340
minutes to deploy that what took you 20 minutes to kill it like all you had to do is fire bursters

390
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,340
tori you want to piggyback on this i just want to throw in that having been there that night

391
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,940
probably gave me such a different perspective that she has the most amazing healthiest perspective and

392
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,460
um on this whole guardian killing kind of thing and we've actually been now as a community we've

393
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:43,220
kind of adopted it um rather than using it as oh my god i've been denied a badge we look at it as

394
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,460
a way to control the opposition but it gets better than that one of the things we created was a

395
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,980
shared spreadsheet and uh we tell our stories you know such and such a person like my husband they

396
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,940
love to hunt my husband um my you know such and such a person went and hunted this person and

397
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,300
they spent this much to go there they drove 150 miles in the rain or whatever and then they said

398
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:08,980
these things and we kind of it's a shared sort of um uh collection if you will of of different

399
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:14,900
things and screenshots and things and in a lot of these people actually it's really not so much

400
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,380
about getting their guardian but just how much fun we're having about with with this i mean that

401
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,500
being said i do wish the the badge itself would go away but i think um there's different ways of

402
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,420
looking at it and i'd say snow's probably got the healthiest way i've ever heard and it's been a lot

403
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,620
of fun ever since then yeah ever since kind of i i kind of looked at it the same way and i i get a

404
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:38,420
kick out of the fact like oh who's gonna go drive to take it out and i i kind of get a kick out of

405
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,500
it you know and i've accepted i'm not gonna get the i was i was actually kind of mad when i got

406
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,420
platinum now granted i had to go get a portal i was actually i can say this now because the

407
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:52,340
portal's long gone i was at magfest in dc i will cry if i ever get onyx i will be in tears i was

408
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:57,620
at magfest in dc and one of my friends one morning was like i want to walk to mcdonald's in the 15

409
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,060
degree weather and we were like for some stupid reason i don't know if we were drunk we were like

410
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:06,660
okay and as we're walking i'm hitting portals like along and then i'm like wow nobody else is

411
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,460
playing out here and so i had a friend who's level 16 keeper charging this portal and they let me get

412
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:18,660
platinum and i was like oh well shoot but then then one day mysteriously i killed a farm and then

413
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:23,380
poof my my guardian disappeared just like it was the funniest coincidence how about that but i

414
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,620
laughed yeah they didn't even have anyone go out to my portal because my portal was at a farm that's

415
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,740
only open for like a month during the year because i went on a field trip one it wasn't open to the

416
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,140
public and they spoofed it to get it well let's let's talk about this movie thing for a minute

417
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,380
but first i do want to make sure you know in the interest of you know disclosing all sides there

418
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,820
was a similar database uh for green players that was called drunken frogs is that what we had

419
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:52,740
drunken frog now nobody in our team was involved with no nobody i believe most of it was europe

420
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,580
based although there was some people in the states right but to be fair cheaters have no

421
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,020
faction can we all agree with that absolutely absolutely can i just before we go too far

422
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,340
spoofing can i just ask am i the only one here with the black

423
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,460
badge i have a guardian no she definitely has a black you do have one okay she tried to throw

424
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:13,780
a field off of her oh that's right i forgot about this yeah and it would be you tried to get them

425
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:18,820
to kill it and they still didn't that's right i forgot about this it was my profile it is my

426
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:24,740
profile picture on g plus oh that's right when the entire time it was clicking as a guardian so

427
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,940
whatever it's gone now it's good i know when i um got mine i thought well what have i done

428
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:35,220
wrong here to not have them come after my portal i don't matter i want to mention

429
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,820
i don't matter over at live.vog network.com kaishido and chat says this sounds like a game

430
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,780
me and my friends played back in the 90s it was called tagging you pretty much wrote your name

431
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,900
all over the city and sometimes other taggers would come and write over your name fun times lol

432
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,340
isn't that illegal i think it is illegal um because i'm gonna play this game now it's basically

433
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,100
yeah it is pissing and marking your territory it's basically what this whole game is yeah

434
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:06,340
except virtually i know roseville player that pretends to piss on portals stop all right yeah

435
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:13,220
let's talk about spoofing so some people feel the need to cheat uh by and when we say spoofing we

436
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:18,820
mean that you're faking your location and yeah it's happened on all sides all teams unfortunately

437
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:25,380
yeah everybody does both sides unfortunately spoofers fuck it up for everybody um i don't i

438
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,780
don't know where we can really go with this topic but what do you think niantic can do about

439
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:35,380
spoofers if anything like what do you think they can do about it anybody well they're gonna have

440
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:43,380
to sort of ramp up their um their algorithms that spot spoofers um but the problem with doing that

441
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,500
is it ends up spotting legitimate players too when something wacky has happened like you have

442
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,540
a gps problem and it jumps you or something like that so they're in a really tough spot it's very

443
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:59,220
difficult for niantic to to be able to just catch to catch them in the act yeah if you have cricket

444
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:04,820
mobile you might look like a spoofer just because or maybe even sometimes t-mobile yeah sometimes

445
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:13,140
t maybe tijuana mobile yeah all right so anyway uh all right so spoofers you know don't don't

446
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,980
play this game you just you ruin it for everybody and it's like the point of playing a location

447
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,620
based game if you're gonna sit in your house like the whole point is to go out like that's what got

448
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:26,260
me into the game is i had to leave the house with my little tiny kids in my van and drive them to

449
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:32,740
parks and go to cemeteries and explore why would you want to do that from home i think some people

450
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:39,540
get their jollies off of hurting other people's accomplishments knowing that fucking people hike

451
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:47,300
in the mountains and people like take zero signal booster things i don't know what the troll game is

452
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:54,180
hardcore right zero i don't know what the hell i called it zero zero no cell no cell signal yeah

453
00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:02,500
zc that's it zero zero cell yeah so they have their own name well whatever anyway but but loki

454
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,260
i mean they took so somebody spoofed your portal because this place was closed it closes in the

455
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:11,060
middle it was like in the middle of the night where was it did you uh it was fog willow farms

456
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,780
so we had a field trip they're only open in october for pumpkins and so we had a field trip

457
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,980
because they do science stuff for schools in april so i had put it down in april when i was there

458
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:26,100
with the class and it is untouchable because you can't hit it from the street there's no way to get

459
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,820
to it unless you trespass on their property and hike all the way across the farm to get it so it

460
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:36,340
could have been a legitimate kill but somebody actually trespassed it was two level sevens that

461
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:42,180
i'd never seen before that yeah it's kind of those telltale people people scream spoofer though a lot

462
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,100
when it's not a spoofer and people are just trespassing and they might not know that they're

463
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:51,780
not allowed to go or sometimes businesses have special openings for stuff or like we had a guy

464
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:56,740
who used to do um work like he didn't machine work on stuff and so he would go into closed wineries

465
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:02,020
and stuff but he wasn't he was there to fix things so i don't know it's it's you shouldn't

466
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:08,660
just scream spoofer unless you know for sure like it's it's hard to tell we can usually tell now

467
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,540
because we've been playing it was also it wasn't just that because i looked at their profile i'm

468
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,940
not saying that you're like i'm sure that there's a profile and just based off of their activity

469
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:21,780
right yeah it was like very very usually you can tell this it's very few portals hacked or visited

470
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:28,100
but a lot of glyph hacking or recharging lots of recharging you yeah you can usually tell a

471
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:35,140
spoofer by their um behavior on just in their own stats because no most people if you're intelligent

472
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:40,340
as a player are not going to use their real account so you wouldn't see one of our regular

473
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,700
res players who's level 16 spoofing for the most part you will see well some of them have but those

474
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:52,580
sure for the most part i said um you might you would usually see uh a player who's got a high

475
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:57,460
level account has created another account maybe or has hired somebody who's created another account

476
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,940
because that is also possible sell these services on ebay right yeah but i mean my point i was gonna

477
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,140
be with that whole story is okay so somebody spooked down loki's guardian but did you cry

478
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,700
yourself to sleep about it i bet you did no i was like oh man that's so close i know you just went

479
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,380
you probably just went what a fucking asshole and went to bed right that's that's it it's like you

480
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,100
know yeah it was i think i was doing something else so like i normally keep my ringer off so

481
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:24,020
you went to therapy for it didn't you oh yeah totally that's why i quit right there you rage

482
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,860
quit uh going to chat over at live.vog network.com um as that said paid spoof takedowns exist you can

483
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,020
buy a guardian portal kill that is very true uh some folks in chat talking about that the same

484
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,580
thing is going on in pokemon go uh sha100 matt saying it's not that beneficial to spoof gyms

485
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:44,500
and pokemon go anymore because you can only get 50 coins a day max um let's see uh i don't see the

486
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,860
value and spoof there's no game yet to pokemon go so i mean i don't either there's no score there's

487
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:56,260
no point in trying to i can't wait till we get pvp you can't even troll a five-year-old like when

488
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,660
i control five-year-olds i'll totally play more tiger claw and chat says i think the reason why

489
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:05,060
some people do this is because the world can be a scary place well yeah some people are assholes

490
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,460
that's just what it is let me let me actually transition to another ingress topic so fuck

491
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:15,460
spoofers yeah that's the game go play xbox tiny url dot fuck spoofers.com to report them yes

492
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,460
um let's talk about scary what's the scariest thing that's ever happened to you playing ingress

493
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:25,700
that's appropriate that's appropriate to talk about on the radio um i can talk about a time i was um

494
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:32,340
gps uh maps was kind of screwed me over we were trying to bring in a shard which is a whole

495
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,900
other fun topic of uh ingress it's one of the is sort of well i like that though that

496
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,300
niantic and quickly the niantic like yes you could say oh the way to play the game is to

497
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,300
make the most mu but for some people it might be about making the biggest field for some people

498
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:50,180
it's about the weekly cycles and you know winning those for some people it's about the niantic live

499
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:55,060
events like the shards and the anomalies we're doing missions to get the banners especially i

500
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,860
know some people on our team that like love missions i hate missions but other people love

501
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,900
they love the banners they love to do that stuff i love them but we don't have them where i live so

502
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:10,020
you know you can make them oh i'm really trying to find a picture i'm a really popular banner

503
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,900
creator would you like me to say i think we have some banner creators i took a picture of a floral

504
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:24,260
couch i brought it for you anyway uh my grandma passed away in the past year i thought it was a

505
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,780
lovely tribute thank you very much uh anyway uh what else was i gonna say with that uh

506
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,140
damn it oh so people have different ways to play the game oh i have a friend that um she listens

507
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,740
to this program and she started playing ingress because she heard me talk about on the show

508
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:43,780
and she's a big train rider and goes across the country she collects the keys oh that's all she

509
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,860
does is she just kind of like collects the keys and i'm like that's i love her yeah like well

510
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:52,340
right she's in the raider collection and throw fields can you please get me in touch with her

511
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:57,620
yes here's again but but um i kind of do the same thing one of my key lockers my my yellow one where

512
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,380
you hit and key locker is like where you can just like store keys i have keys for when i went to

513
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:08,180
pax west pax east i have keys from disneyland tori's saying why don't you just take a screenshot

514
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:15,220
do you feel like that's a waste of space rob i feel like that's a waste you know it's a waste

515
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:20,180
of space is the keys i've had from you to do a field can we layer through disneyland for like

516
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,140
a year and a half okay when you layer through disneyland you let me know this one is feasible

517
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,780
like the keys you're holding are feasible i've had them for like two goddamn years well then then

518
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:37,060
maybe push a little harder i will definitely fall on the sword and go to disneyland to support your

519
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:43,540
plan all right cool cool we're gonna do this disney layer so shards anyway yes shards scary

520
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:48,820
the moment when you said why am i playing this why am i playing this fucking game so uh shards

521
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,860
just as a quick background is this like side game and niantic puts on that we have to move

522
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:58,180
some item that sits on one portal through a link to another portal so in this case you don't need

523
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:05,140
the triangle you just need the one link um so we were trying to bring in a shard to the nevada area

524
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:12,100
up near reno um from utah and that was the most fucked up shard situation it was bouncing around

525
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,980
utah and airport for like i think two weeks or something stupid well our opposition has a strong

526
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:22,820
presence in utah utah yeah very strong yeah um and i mean it's slightly like less than it was

527
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:30,340
at that time but it definitely was just a shit show for our side and so i was directed to go to

528
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,100
this portal i'd never been to it was the middle of the night it was probably like midnight maybe 1

529
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:40,020
a.m and i had to work the next day by the way um and i i don't know what the hell happened with

530
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:47,620
my gps but it decided to take me up this like unlit mountainy kind of road thing and i was in

531
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:53,300
my shitty little subaru that didn't want to take these these like couldn't go over these boulders

532
00:36:53,300 --> 00:37:00,420
and i just kind of got stuck in my car in the middle of nowhere in nevada at 1 a.m like and

533
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:06,500
it was terrible and i don't remember exactly how i mean sheridan for a field next to a meth lab so

534
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,020
i don't hear it hey listen i've been next to my share of meth labs for ingress too

535
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:16,740
i'm surprised we don't all do drugs that's that's ingress explore the meth labs around the world

536
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,060
they're all in sheridan uh tori i don't know if you wanted to share your story the xm comes from

537
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,860
you had a reaction when i said uh the time you were like why am i playing this shit is there

538
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:33,380
a story here there are a lot of stories um but i would say overall probably the the creepiest one

539
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,180
was has happened more than once and um i haven't shared this with a lot of people so now i'm

540
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:43,220
showing it with a whole lot of people um well to be fair it's a it's not that many here at orange

541
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:51,140
on radio all five people we're not game spot all five people so um it's happened it's happened with

542
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,140
my husband in town but it the most of the time it's happened has been when my husband was out

543
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,180
of town and now we're even when he wasn't playing ingress or too much uh we kind of understanding

544
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:07,620
how that happened now but um they would basically leave keys in my house um keys that were two

545
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,580
strategic portals that made it really obvious who they were and they would leave keys leaving

546
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:20,020
leading up to my house um and that's if i was to say the creepiest thing that's probably it

547
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:24,820
because her house is not somewhere you would go it's not a poor house no it's not a place you

548
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:31,380
would go ever it's on a remote area i get lost every time i go there remote but it's not it's

549
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,260
not on the way nowhere near a portal it's near portals but it's not super we would never go to

550
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:41,940
my house exactly to go from one portal to another no that would not happen um since then i've gotten

551
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:50,820
extensive security um extensive security we call it smurf cam but um but um hey rez rez if you're

552
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:56,820
listening don't go near her house seriously it'll be like that i won't even go near her house no

553
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,700
it's sad that it got that way and i'm sure there are a lot of resistance players that have

554
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,500
had that kind of thing happen it's one of the dangers and this important this is our perspective

555
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,100
what's happening here around the world we can't speak for our team members around the world

556
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:20,260
exactly so this is her experience anyway but what the thing with with alternative reality

557
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:27,460
types of gaming is that you have that's one of the dangers of it you basically have this idea that

558
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:32,500
you are you know you've got your home or your workplace and things like that and you're

559
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,140
you're playing in those places or you're you're living in those places and it's kind of where

560
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:42,020
basically the game is is sort of overlaid onto your real life and so those kinds of things can

561
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:46,580
happen um when people use tools and things to find out more information than they're entitled

562
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,980
to in the game that makes it more difficult but again that happens on both sides and it's

563
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,860
that's probably the creepiest thing there have been a number of real interesting things though

564
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,380
i don't understand that i don't understand why people would do that you know though and in that

565
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,100
i don't understand to intimidate those i know that but like why it's tried to scare you because you

566
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,700
said i almost quit because of this and that's what they want you are too targeted they want

567
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:12,180
you to quit but it makes me feel more so there's they keep trying to do it to me but they keep

568
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:18,820
missing my house they like drop the keys too far and i'm like that's not my house dickheads

569
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,180
like seriously though but they don't i don't care like i would if i they were there even if they're

570
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:29,060
people who are like super against me i'd be like hey what's up because i would invite them in for

571
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:35,700
a drink especially limoncello um but they don't they don't scare me like what are you gonna do

572
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,300
because i can have legal action if you do something really retarded sorry i shouldn't

573
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,260
say retarded really stupid retarded means an adult who doesn't think like an adult

574
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:51,540
for me anyway so like i that's a terrible word i shouldn't use it anyway so um no like but why

575
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,620
why would you do that why would you target people that doesn't even make sense like use your time

576
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:01,860
more effectively why are you wasting gas money i would say it's just creepy stupid stalker crap

577
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,700
well it's it is but you're gonna find that anywhere pathetic you're gonna find it anywhere

578
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:10,420
it really means they're pathetic to be fair it's a part of like internet culture i was almost gonna

579
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,980
say gamer culture but yeah a part of internet culture how do people want to get revenge on

580
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,540
other people by doxing people do things that are fucked up they're like swatting

581
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,300
that that article recently we're gonna get into that later in the show absolutely you don't know

582
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,380
about that you're looking at me so here's the deal with doxing i don't think that everything

583
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:32,900
is doxing like everybody screams doxing at the drop of a hat and i don't think so it's publicly

584
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:38,740
available information it's not doxing depends on what it is you know but i think people scream it

585
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:44,740
too soon just like they scream spoofer too soon i think that people no don't pull my mic don't

586
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:51,300
pull my mic like if you here's the deal if you do something stupid and you do something wrong

587
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,820
you should expect to get caught and you should expect to be exposed but i think that um the

588
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:01,620
doxing that they're talking about is more like in the the the publishing people's information

589
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,380
like publishing maybe where tori lives you know that kind of thing that would be doxing because

590
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,860
she didn't there's no reason for it she's not a politician or anything yeah so and they have and

591
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,580
she hasn't done anything wrong except for play the game in a way that they don't like yeah that's

592
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,500
totally doxing but like but if you do something wrong if you're cheating and someone says you

593
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,100
were cheating and they expose you for cheating that's not doxing that's you being a dick and

594
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,180
getting caught and here's the other thing that always kind of gets me if we all quit you're

595
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:31,940
going to be fucking bored right um yeah i live in a green area i'm not bored well no but i'm saying

596
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,100
i'm saying if everybody from the same team quits and this will go both ways if everybody's in the

597
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:40,180
same team quits y'all are going to be really fucking bored because this is about you need

598
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:46,180
both sides we're talking to you roseville and fulsomes well anyway no seriously no you're

599
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:52,020
right you would you would be really bored when my res don't play i'm bored yeah i don't understand

600
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,300
the point of playing when you don't have an opposition it's like playing pokemon i don't

601
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,460
know i wouldn't be bored if they would stop playing in my area our pal bobby blackwolf

602
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,180
in chat says uh i don't think broadcasting someone's personal information is appropriate

603
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:08,420
punishment for cheating in a video game exactly you have to follow them through town with a bell

604
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:14,820
yelling shame this shame shame this is no no not they're real no no no no not necessarily

605
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:19,860
their personal information more like their agent name like if you say this agent was cheating

606
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:24,420
that's not doxing that's not doxing no but if you put yeah if you put the real name and where they

607
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,900
work yeah that is doxing so i'm like very specifically like if you are in the game and

608
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:34,100
your in-game name is then told to people you cheated then you should expect it i'm glad we

609
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:39,300
could clarify that for people to register participation for this week's episode of

610
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:46,820
royan challenge radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase game uh kaijuto in chat says get these

611
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:52,580

613
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:03,620
our beginning to any opportunity for him to do another podcast he'll do it it's already being

614
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:08,340
planned anyway all right uh let's uh let me ask about this too i do want to we unfortunately can't

615
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,860
talk all night about ingress we probably could but let me ask about this let me ask about the

616
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:16,100
future of ingress because this is a little bit scary for some people um the game has been

617
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,020
for yeah primitives let's talk about primitives right so the game do you want to i said we were

618
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:27,860
not going to talk about ops spec or drama tonight but i think this drama would be okay drama it's

619
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:32,100
funny do you want to talk about why i'm dead to you jen would you like tell the story on yeah

620
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:37,620
he's dead to jen by the way okay tell why am i dead to jen rob is dead to me because

621
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:45,540
you know we have chatted with the others the um makers of the game niantic and they throw

622
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:50,180
anomalies every once in a while and there was just a sort of like hey we should have an anomaly in

623
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,740
sacramento again because we've had one previously and it was it was a good time and but i wasn't

624
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:58,980
there so it wasn't a real party right rob wasn't there i was only level seven and i i didn't get

625
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:06,180
to go and so um we had sort of a get together with um some of our mods and some of our our people

626
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:12,740
with in within the community and um snow and myself and another agent who was our designated

627
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:17,300
driver because snow and i had been drinking far too much at that time i decided to run to target

628
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:23,700
because i needed something very desperately it was not needed it was a pug pillow doorstop it

629
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:30,340
was desperately needed um but i come back and rob and all of the people in the party who are still

630
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:36,340
there 15 20 people in this party yeah um have decided to tell me that there is an anomaly

631
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:41,220
happening in sacramento in like what a month i think it was you said i think i think i said

632
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:46,180
jen have you checked google yes have you checked they just announced it in europe they're doing an

633
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,700
anomaly on february whatever i picked a saturday in february i said they're doing anomaly in

634
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,300
february and they're doing it i think i actually said i said they're doing it in mobile because

635
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:57,940
i thought about you mobile yes that's where i'm from okay that's where it came from i said they're

636
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,940
doing it in mobile and they're doing it in uh i think i just threw a rant i was like i think

637
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,300
they're doing i don't even like walla walla washington or something and they're doing it in

638
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:10,020
sacramento and it's called it's the ingress primatist and i kid you not i dropped my purse

639
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:16,100
she dropped her purse and i had to keep a straight face and everybody she dropped her purse and

640
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:21,860
started screaming expletive yes yeah and when you said mobile i said i'm calling bullshit on this

641
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,420
and i grabbed my phone and i started looking at the website at which point you did what

642
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:34,580
you lied faster and harder and snow was less drunk than me so for you know that particular

643
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:41,620
we had had the same amount so after about a minute of jen being like fully hysterical

644
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,900
i thought yeah well i said it was primatist primatist is the name of the series

645
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:53,140
optimist primatist i was singing a primatine and so because you'll need it after you hyperventilate

646
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:58,180
oh i definitely was hyperventilating it takes a lot to plan an anomaly and so one month i mean

647
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:03,380
we did it previously you don't want to do it in one month but it really really sucked and so i

648
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:10,180
was just like oh my god i couldn't believe it but i believed him and then finally after like a minute

649
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,620
when snow's like starting to look at her phone and look at me i turn around to everybody else

650
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:19,540
at the party and i say okay y'all get that on video and nobody did and nobody did which pisses

651
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:24,100
me off oh it's so great i'm so glad everybody everybody busts up laughing because remember

652
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:29,380
20 people had to like keep that a secret and then and they all stood there with the serious faces

653
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:37,220
oh it's awful i hate them like i thought someone had died i walked in i swear to you i walked in

654
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:43,940
and everybody was very solemn and it was like these sad faces and rob says something serious

655
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:50,580
has happened and i was like he goes you need to get you need to get jen in here right i went

656
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:54,820
oh okay and i turned around i went out there i go something's happened you guys like they're very

657
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:59,780
serious people look like they might cry at any second like what is going on we need to go in

658
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:07,700
and then rob dumped a bunch of bullshit all over us i'm so glad that it was you and not me because

659
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:12,980
i don't think i could have held it together nobody i think i don't even remember how that came

660
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:17,300
together like i i everybody wants to blame me but i really think it was dr graft that started that

661
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,500
whole thing like at least i'm gonna throw him under the bus i would not be surprised if it

662
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,100
was him who came up with but then like he kind of threw it out there and then like i ran with it

663
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:31,300
i'm gonna win the oscar for this shit you did you won an oscar for that i did well then i also won

664
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:37,220
a stabbing from jen he did i'm saving it for later the look that she gave me you guys the stitches

665
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:43,620
are healing i died i died in place it's like you called me more than just a son of a bitch

666
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:50,100
you screamed you screamed that he was dead to you you screamed fuck you it was bad it was it was

667
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:56,420
very dangerous she came over and did the drunk play hitting thing you know thing anyway so the

668
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,260
reason why i was able to get away with calling it primatist is because we know that there's this new

669
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:04,420
version of ingress coming that's been in the news lately called ingress prime obviously niantic has

670
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:10,740
had a lot of success with pokemon go and ingress although it's fun it's an aging game it's showing

671
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,340
its age you need to be able to change your direction on the map with one finger yeah right

672
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:18,020
right well and that's one of the that's one of the big things i know i hate that i have to use two

673
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:24,740
fingers what is wrong with you i guess that i can use one when i do pokemon because i'm i'm never

674
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:29,620
driving when i play but when i click to go to click on something and it spins the screen i get

675
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:33,540
mad why does pokemon have functionality that ingress doesn't have because people took the

676
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:38,180
feedback and put it in pokemon go you know what niantic we love you so much we want an anomaly

677
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:45,220
here but seriously let's get that fixed i've never noticed you need two hands yeah because no she

678
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:49,380
doesn't play any other games i know that okay controversial you guys but you could just make

679
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:54,340
it an option like a check yeah if they make it an option i would be pleased with that anyway so we

680
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:58,900
know they're gonna make a new version called ingress prime that's coming out soon trademark

681
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:07,940
tm soon tam when it is um tori and i at the san francisco anomaly last month we got to actually

682
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:12,340
kind of peek at this and see a little sneak preview of it and i thought graphically it looked

683
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,860
really cool part of the thing that drew me to ingress in the first place was that it looked

684
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:20,420
like tron and i was like you know but it was you mean like old school tron yeah fuck yeah old

685
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:25,940
school look at my hat today tron yeah i love tron but there was never and what always bugged me green

686
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,060
is my favorite color and it always bugged me there were no green people in tron they're all

687
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:35,220
blue or red blue is my favorite color is why are you green well i mean you know because when i

688
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:39,700
chose enlightened a my friend was green and i sat there looking at my phone she goes you have to

689
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:44,660
choose green i said no i don't hang on and i thought enlightened and i read the thing about

690
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:49,380
enlightened and i thought okay i think leonardo da vinci i think enlightened and then when i

691
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:55,700
looked at resistance all i could think of was the south park episode like law resistance lives on

692
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,460
like that whole thing right right so and i thought i'm sure they sing it when they right

693
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:04,420
and so in my head what i thought was if the first thing i think of when i think of resistance is

694
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:11,220
south park and a song i'm totally enlightened there's no fucking way like like or and whoa

695
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,540
hang on the second song i thought of by the way with resistance was from lay miz yeah the

696
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:22,980
resistance i'm like french sewers like no like all i'm thinking of is music i'm thinking of music

697
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,980
it's just right it's one question no it's one question no so like this is really what

698
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,580
happens so like i'm thinking i'm thinking of music i'm clearly enlightened so i press the

699
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:37,460
green okay usually i should tell you the story about when i asked shane to play ingress and

700
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,820
that if you would play ingress he would be more likely to get an invite to pokemon go

701
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:45,620
and he's like okay i signed up for ingress but i picked the blue team because i love blue and i was

702
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:53,140
like this isn't a fucking joke shane if you pick the blue what do you think this is i can't i

703
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:59,620
cannot help you shane why why but good news everybody good news he deleted and and did a

704
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:05,300
green account and then he got to level six and he was like i don't get it stop you don't play after

705
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:11,460
level six i'm not shane no he's not shane it's matt he still plays he's he's badge lock no shane

706
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,300
isn't here shane i'm talking really bad with names talking about him that's all about names

707
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:21,220
right shane's not here no shane's the worst like let's talk about shane i'll be sure to send that

708
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:28,100
to him this is stupid i need one more platinum to hit level nine i mean i need a silver so quickly

709
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,900
quickly because i do want to get into news because we're almost an hour in and we haven't talked

710
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:37,460
about a single video game yet uh besides excuse me besides ingress so what about uh ingress we

711
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:42,980
also talked about two dots okay what about ingress prime what what do you are you excited for ingress

712
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:49,780
prime are you scared i am both um i think it will be jesse spano i'm so excited i'm so i'm so scared

713
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:58,740
exactly i am hopeful that the functionality of it will be improved but i'm a little worried that

714
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:04,420
they're going to have a lot of um sort of problems with it you know launching and having a lot of

715
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:09,700
bugs but i mean we've dealt with bugs with ingress we've dealt with uh i think pokemon

716
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:14,500
people have dealt with bugs too so and harry potter soon that's right and the chat we just

717
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,020
brought that up too that we're gonna get harry potter i'm concerned that people with older phones

718
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:22,100
who play ingress are not going to be able to play ingress prime and that bothers me that's happening

719
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:27,380
with pokemon go pokemon go just that bugs me because you should have a game that doesn't well

720
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:34,180
first of all when i play pokemon even now my phone overheats and it's ridiculous that's because that

721
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:41,140
sucked as far as battery life is yeah no it's horrible like i already carry extra battery

722
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:47,780
chargers and cords and all kinds of crap but like why is my phone overheating i have to turn my ac on

723
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:53,140
and cool my phone off before i battle a gym that's right i remember beta testing uh pokemon go as

724
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:58,020
well yeah yeah like keep it right next same thing it would just overheat all the time no like i

725
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:02,500
beta tested and it was so bad when they used to have like the the like leaves that would blow the

726
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:07,380
grass that would blow yeah they had the leaves animation yeah so it overheated so i'm concerned

727
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,860
that they're they're focusing on the graphics and that it's going to cause phones to overheat

728
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:16,580
it's going to cause older phones to not work that that distresses me a little bit well even like

729
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:21,460
you need to make it so that everyone can still play regardless of what phone they have what

730
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:25,700
processor they have it's yeah it's nothing to do with the graphics the engine that runs in unity

731
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:30,580
is pretty lightweight i mean in the the stuff that they have in there is very just it's it's

732
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:35,220
nothing the phone should be able to do that it's how they're pinging the wi-fi and how they're

733
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:39,300
pinging the gps that overheats that thing tori what about you because you and i actually stood

734
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:44,340
in a line to see the game uh at uh the ingress event in december they were showing they showed

735
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:48,980
a little demo of uh prime and we got to see it what do you think are you scared excited um i

736
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:54,340
think i'm a little bit both um yeah i do think that um i think the graphics i mean improved

737
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:58,820
graphics are definitely going to be a plus improved functionality will be a plus yes i'm

738
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:04,180
concerned about people with older phones um i'm also concerned about something they said they

739
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:10,420
kept talking about it as a game reset or something like that and i'm wondering like are they some

740
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:15,540
people have said yes and some people have said no um are they gonna like seriously have us all start

741
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:21,700
over no that is no not from the beginning badges but i mean in terms of the map there was something

742
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:26,500
that oh about no they're not resetting the portal clarified that the portals will not be reset

743
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:31,460
oh good good good so that would be one thing it's the only thing that sweet krug did not tap dance

744
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:36,420
around well good because that would be one thing it would be like i mean that would be just like

745
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:42,580
crazy if everybody's sitting there going oh my god but um the other thing would be um i think

746
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:48,740
that i'm hoping is that there's maybe more stuff to kind of make the cheating less likely or more

747
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:55,620
traceable um i'm hoping that that will happen but i'm excited about it i think it's it's i mean we're

748
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:59,940
ready for a change we've done i'm excited for the people that are gonna you know because ingress is

749
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,540
kind of an older game we don't get a lot of people anymore the only new people we really get are

750
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,060
pokemon go players don't get me wrong because we have had some awesome new ones lately that came

751
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:12,100
from pokemon go because they want to submit they want to submit pokestops and then they realize

752
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:16,260
ingress is better and that really happened there's a guy right here in my neighborhood who we were

753
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,060
talking to at a raid and he's like i don't know i don't but then he finally installed the game and

754
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:23,780
then like a couple weeks later uh one of the other agents here and we all met up at a raid he's like

755
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:28,900
dude ingress is like way more fun ingress is way more fun than pokemon it really is

756
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:34,900
i it really is there's room in the world for both that's just me no i okay full disclosure

757
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:40,100
i'm level 36 in pokemon and i've got a higher level than me i've got over 17 000 pokemon so

758
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:45,540
like i play pokemon i do i play it a lot but i'm like a lot potter i don't know if i can do three

759
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:50,420
i can do harry potter i want you better let me beta test it hey niantic if you listen to this

760
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:55,140
i want to beta test i'm gonna do harry pot i'm gonna play the harry potter game as well i mean

761
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:59,460
i'm already playing animal crossing and mitomo at the same time that's not the same thing no

762
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:04,180
but i'm playing like five different games that i check every day but the prerequisite to beta

763
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:10,500
testing pokemon was to be level 16 in ingress and and have like no no that was something else

764
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,260
never mind i'm talking a little higher it was about 12 or so because i got in it i mean even

765
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:18,980
so when it comes out i'm gonna play it i thought you were level 10 rub no i finally leveled finally

766
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:24,100
after all these years i'm actually at 15 oh you get the fuck out i actually learned at 2 a.m last

767
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,540
night i was like the fuck out right i didn't learn but i kind of like remembered i was like wow you

768
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:34,420
get a lot of ap from fucking up farms yeah you do yeah uh yeah if i really wanted a power level i

769
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,500
guess i could shout out to the lord fu how do you think he leveled so fast he freaking burned down

770
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:43,540
novada county all the time all right uh going to chat at live.vognetwork.com as zet and chat says

773
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:01,060
i'm sorry but that's okay that's what act deft yeah we'll try again with your community like you

774
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:07,860
get to meet people in ingress i'm serious i do i i yes your your answer is incorrect to be fair

775
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:11,060
to be fair you get to meet people in pokemon go with this with the raids and everything not the

776
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:15,380
same it's not the same a little bit all right he tried at least a lot of people won't even try

777
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:22,420
i mean if he's in sacramento play with us he's actually he's in mexico he's not here so oh wait

778
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:28,340
we have some things for you to do in ingress if you could level the eight we you would love it you

779
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:33,460
would love ingress that's all i gotta say like you're in mexico we love you all right anyway

780
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:37,860
uh let's see oh this is a great question from zeba this is another hot issue in uh ingress

781
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:41,460
so we'll probably wrap up after this question get to the rest of the show uh zeba and chat says i

782
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:48,580
have a question did anyone there get in trouble for trespassing to get to portals no another

783
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:54,340
another you would never trespass i would never trespass i wouldn't i would not trespass so um

784
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,380
wait but i want to go back to shards before you end because i have something to say it's fine

785
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:02,580
go ahead all right i don't trespass i don't okay good good good girl what about you jen have you

786
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:06,180
ever gotten in trouble for trespassing i've never gotten in trouble for trespassing um we did have

787
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:12,420
some portals in my hometown that were on a um fire like at a fire station and we were was i was

788
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:17,620
with my son and we were trying to cap it and you could hear over the loudspeaker of them like

789
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:22,660
talking about us being there so we laughed very quickly it was that was probably in the first year

790
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:26,900
or so that i played though that was that's about the furthest the closest to being in trouble for

791
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,500
trespassing that i've ever met yeah like there were people out there like what are these people

792
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:36,420
doing out front why the hell were they on a loudspeaker i don't know okay not very secretive

793
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,100
they can't hear us the fire department needs to get their shit together tori how about the

794
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:45,220
trespassing issue for you have you ever been accused of it or you you had to do it or what

795
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:49,540
i haven't trespassed i don't think i've been accused of it i'm sure i'll be set straight if

796
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:55,380
i'm wrong about that but um the way i look at it is this if i trespass to take a portal it's it's

797
00:59:55,380 --> 01:00:01,060
not legit so if i take it and i were to throw a blocker to it or use it for a field or something

798
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:08,900
like that it kind of casts doubt or i don't know it kind of puts an asterisk if you will um next to

799
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:13,780
whatever i do with that portal so that's why i really feel like any trespassing you know needs

800
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:18,660
to be any portals taken legitimately i've even gone out to take green portals that have been

801
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:25,380
spoofed green just to make them legit green so i kind of look at it like that so i i i don't

802
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:29,940
trespass no i don't either i i will say that i'm gonna admit to this because i think this is a gray

803
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:34,900
area i've been in a park after dark and yes i've played ingress but it's not it's such a gray area

804
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,900
because you know some people say oh well you know you will get screamed at in comms you know oh the

805
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:45,700
posted park hours it's like i am walking from point a to point b as a lot of night joggers do

806
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:51,700
and i just happen to have my phone out busting your shit and i'm not smoking marijuana like

807
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:56,260
that's why they have those hours right they have it for camping and that kind of thing what's wrong

808
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:01,540
with smoking marijuana it's 2018 now it's legal now but you're not doing crack all that stuff

809
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:07,140
aside but i also think some people forget that um there's some a lot of times there's more than

810
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,580
one way and this is on both sides i'm not accusing the other team of this because i've had to tell

811
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:16,260
our own people hey dial it back because sometimes there's more than one way to get to a portal

812
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:20,100
that's another big one is that there's some where people go that's behind a gate that's behind a

813
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:25,140
gate but it's like but did you know you could get behind it if you're willing to walk for half a

814
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:30,580
mile down a trail or did you do you know somebody who works there or any other things that's a big

815
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:35,380
one ask that our community members not trespass and and that is a big thing if we find out that

816
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:39,620
you're doing it repetitively it would be a problem for us but generally like if you're just walking

817
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:45,300
through like caesar chavez park what's our motto don't cheat no which thing yeah that's

818
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:50,260
got if you're gonna be our motto is don't be a dick sorry don't be a dick if you're gonna be at

819
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:56,980
caesar chavez park after hours like that's on you that's dangerous place that's on you it's not that

820
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,260
is not a great place to be capping portals in the middle of the night just don't but what's

821
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:05,380
interesting we're gonna assume you're buying heroin again because of pokemon go i mean right

822
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:10,740
now capital park is for is there's a thing nesting there called a wailmer which is a very

823
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:16,340
highly desired pokemon because you need like 400 of them to evolve it what's a wailmer exactly so

824
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:20,660
there's a lot of people at capital park it's my buddy just so you know it's my buddy there's at

825
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:26,980
all hours are trying to catch wailers so can i go really quickly over shards yes quickly okay

826
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:33,540
i hate them and why is that i fucking hate them because i don't sleep okay downyville i was in

827
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:38,260
downyville for two shards you're downyville is no you don't no you don't i do you do only because

828
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:44,500
of ingress does anybody else know where downyville is i've been no no did you know signal is famous

829
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:50,820
for the bubble wrap parade they will put bubble wrap also famous for mountain biking okay like a

830
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:54,660
legitimate thing mountain bike over the boat more about the bubble wrap i do they lay bubble wrap on

831
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,220
the street and then they have a parade and that's what they do instead of fireworks because you

832
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:01,220
can't have fireworks up there are you kidding me no yeah on the 4th of july they have a bubble

833
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:05,940
literally california will burn down again oh my god i want to go to there okay i literally

834
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:12,420
on fourth of july i literally taped i ducked duct taped bubble wrapped my floor and let my kids walk

835
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:19,540
on it so this is genius i love it i love it i've done this but downyville i was up there twice

836
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:28,180
twice for shards no i didn't sleep 48 hours no sleep every time horrible um yeah shards yeah

837
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:34,020
i don't know if our audience i was awake for fucking 72 hours rob you're making ingress

838
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:39,220
sound great no this is for shards shards suck by the way i played uh dragon age inquisition

839
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:46,660
there are shards no no there are shards and when i saw them when i saw the shards i said fuck shards

840
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:50,980
i hate shards and then all of a sudden i started collecting shards and let me tell you it's way

841
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:55,380
easier when you can do it from your couch true oops and not downyville although they're still

842
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:00,180
annoying no i love them because they're not in downyville and you don't have to drive

843
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:04,980
anywhere off that was on my end sorry i forgot to close google yeah what the hell my bad so anyway

844
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:10,500
shards and dragon age inquisition love them shards and ingress fuck you all right anyway

845
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:15,300
so i was just i was just gonna say how you really i don't know if we had effectively communicated

846
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,460
to the listeners just how hardcore you guys can be about ingress but thank you snow for your whole

847
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:24,260
like 72 hour binge story i think it's like the guy who had to get the camper toilet put in next

848
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:32,180
to his chair for playing world of warcraft wait a minute you can do that because i'm gonna do that

849
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:35,860
who did that how do you kill that which because that guy needs to play ingress

850
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:43,460
also catheters catheters are a thing guys hopefully on our team because the other team

851
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:50,500
has a lot all right uh whatever tori anyway you don't drink water when we hike any any last things

852
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,780
you guys want to say about ingress maybe something maybe like a pitch for for our

853
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:57,780
listeners who have not played this game maybe something you download and join the green team

854
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:01,140
or you know especially if you're in northern california you need to join the green team if

855
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:07,300
you're in other places you know whatever but yeah but no green team nothing california come on okay

856
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:11,860
so no there's play styles that are different in every area so before you join you should look at

857
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:18,580
the map well you can join yes okay shut up so join then look at the map and decide what you want to

858
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:25,860
do so in our area specifically the resistance are about like holding daily fields they call them the

859
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:31,380
blob like you hold your daily fields whereas enlightened about play however you want and we

860
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:36,580
want to win we'll throw big fields so i think there's just a play style difference so just

861
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:40,260
look at your area because if you're far away you might look at your area and say like i want to be

862
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:46,420
a part of a community and look at that or i want to be i want to be into the espionage and secret

863
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:50,740
squirrel stuff and then choose the opposite team but like look at your area first and also be

864
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:58,100
retired so you can play all the time oh my god no shit right look um look at um google plus i know

865
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:04,580
it's weird oh sorry barry i'm not a single mom stay at home mom my bad hold on hold on uh so for

866
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:09,220
for ingress ingressers are still using google plus because ingress started as a google or niantic

867
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:13,540
started as a big for yourself there's a lot but even on facebook i would put put your name

868
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:17,780
and then enlightened to start and see if it's a good fit for you

869
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,820
and then if it were me check check resistance as long as you're not in northern california

870
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:28,340
no i will say you know there was something happening with their g plus thing so there's

871
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:34,100
actually no ingress um g plus like group anymore as of today they said it was temporary we got rid

872
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:39,540
of it well if there's something wrong not saki and l but like the overarching ingress there was

873
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:45,460
something going on maybe like porn bots full disclosure don't try and join the enlightened

874
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:51,220
ingress or g plus group right no just ingress g all right yyr in chat says i can say for certain

875
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:56,900
that yes their level of ingress hardcoreism has been effectively communicated no i'm not i like

876
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:01,380
to microfield let me let me try ending on this note i'll start with you tori let me try ending

877
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:06,580
on this note what keeps you a fan of ingress after all this time why do you keep signing

878
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:12,900
into the app why do you keep playing it's in this room oh it really it is it's me you guys it's me

879
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:19,140
you know what i'll be honest there are times i feel tired and i'm just like oh you know there's

880
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:24,420
gonna be a day when this game isn't here and there there's really two things and i try to

881
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:30,500
imagine sometimes if i stop playing this game am i still gonna see these people and some of you

882
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:37,780
yes definitely um but it's this community and i've made so many friends and i that's what i love

883
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:42,980
about our faction i just think we have an amazing community the other thing is that is the places

884
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:49,220
that it brings you yeah i went to a part of hawaii the other day that without this game i never would

885
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:56,260
have ever thought it was very remote very obscure one lane road etc and oh my gosh the the amazing

886
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:00,900
kind of the crazy stories you'll tell and the places you've been i mean i think those two

887
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:06,420
things alone are really what keeps me going in this game so my day job recently expanded into

888
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:11,620
a lot of rural parts of california where now we service you know more parts of the state including

889
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:17,300
these rural areas and because of ingress now when like people are like i've never heard of this

890
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:21,860
place where is elk creek i'm like oh i know i've been there it's uh it's up north off i-5 you gotta

891
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:26,980
go left and it's like shit this game has like taught me things that i'm using in my day job

892
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:31,540
what is going on wait a minute you go to elk creek i went i went there because somebody in

893
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:35,140
this room isn't that where you got your yeah that's where i got my onyx yeah somebody in

894
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:40,340
this room set that whole thing up oh interesting all right anyway that was me but i no longer have

895
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:46,900
keys so it was me by the way you're welcome uh i think it was her that put that one together no

896
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:52,980
i thought it was the one that was me that was my solo sorry oh my bad wait that was the one

897
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:57,860
where it's like run toward the water i operated me yelling run towards all right i opt that solo

898
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:01,780
so we're talking all about bobby blackwolf says the real prize is the friendships we made along

899
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:07,620
the way as we all fight about who did what fact snow they literally it's the people it's the

900
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:12,020
people that keep you going every day yes it's the people i love the people i've met so many people

901
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:18,340
and the thing is i actually like a lot of the res unlike other people um i like a lot of the res

902
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:24,180
and i talk to them and they're nice and they're fantastic i love them the vast majority are nerds

903
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:29,540
just like me who picked a different color at the beginning of the game whatever right exactly yeah

904
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:33,780
and so i like the people and i like to be i even like the opposition but mostly i like my own

905
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:38,180
people because i talk to them every day even if i don't go i just go hack a portal and i'll throw

906
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:42,580
a field anything i'm able to keep in contact with these people and i've met them in person it's not

907
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:47,460
like a creepy internet relationship where you've never met the person like i've met them weirdly

908
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:51,860
at two in the morning in a dark park but it doesn't matter i've met them in person so it

909
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:56,020
matters to me jen what about you what keeps you going on ingress every day well on a personal

910
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:01,460
level i do really continue to to grind stats i really like that like personal challenge that

911
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:08,420
i set for myself but but um as both tori and snow said it is definitely the community um

912
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:14,420
i've been running ish this community for about the whole time i've been playing it was probably

913
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:18,900
around the time i hit level eight that i was brought in to be made a mod by the people who

914
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:23,140
are running it at that time and it's just been something that i've continued to do for almost

915
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:30,420
five years so it's i love meeting our new people i like seeing how people get excited over fields

916
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:35,780
i like how we help each other and people move each other from houses to houses and they do

917
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:40,740
personal things for each other yeah i catsat for a guy i met playing here in this neighborhood

918
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:45,300
exactly this is weird shit like that right this is not just like a game in many ways it's also

919
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:49,940
you you end up with a lot of friendships and like unfortunately christy who's not here tonight she

920
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:55,300
was going to be but she and i met in playing ingress it was not so oh i would thought you

921
01:10:55,300 --> 01:11:00,580
guys were bifs beforehand no no we need to bail her out after the show we're gonna bail her out

922
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:06,980
from the er actually i got a message her son had fallen while playing pokemon of all things and

923
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:13,140
he's okay it's a dangerous game don't play it no um play ingress enlightened instead but anyway i

924
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:19,780
met i met christy um of all places playing ingress at the circle kind of near both of our works and

925
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:25,940
we see each other every single day twice a day during the work week and we are best friends and

926
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:31,460
i don't think that's ever going to change what about you and me oh second best friends that's

927
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:39,140
why you're allowed to have more than one bridesmaid all right all right so it's you and me tori um i

928
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:42,580
would actually say to the one thing that i think you guys didn't mention i'll close on this like

929
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:48,260
for me is the live events like the anomalies because you know the day-to-day weekly stuff

930
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:52,740
like you know there's just people out there that are more dedicated to the game than i am and

931
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:58,020
there's just you know there's just nothing i can do about that um but the live events really feel

932
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:03,300
like like they're big conventions they're big parties you know nerd awesome stuff even whether

933
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:08,260
we win or lose because no we went to chicago we got our ass kicked and i still had a blast yeah

934
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:13,060
i had a blast full no seriously when someone said anomalies to me the first time and they said a

935
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:16,980
bunch of people get together and you battle for portals and i thought you bunch of fucking nerds

936
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:23,780
i am not i will never go to an anomaly ever i think it's dumb like i am never gonna do that

937
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:31,300
oh my god it's so fun it is a giant party you can act like a kid it's great it is a snow and

938
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:35,700
i held hands and skipped down the street we totally skipped down the street to go capture

939
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:40,100
a portal together yeah and like rob said you can totally be losing like we went to utah uh

940
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:46,260
state salt lake city and we lost so bad and it was still so much fun and also kind of tying into

941
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:50,500
the last one of the other things tori said was you see new places i never would have gone to

942
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:57,060
salt lake city i don't know i never would have done that i've never lost anything ever stop

1022
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:46,580
because i like the voice acting in it but it's not pretty enough it doesn't look a lot better

1023
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:52,420
the silent hill games in hd suck but i want a really good first silent hill hd remake that

1024

1029
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:21,860
for your gaming week that's it all right loki how about you how much game a week you'll never guess

1030
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:28,820
which game i played this week lego no ingress but yes um no i actually started stardew valley

1031
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:34,900
oh shit is that because i was like i have all these games in my backlog let's try stardew

1032
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:40,420
valley and it's i don't know it's just like um you can romance people in stardew valley it's

1033
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:45,220
like for those of you not watching he shook his head like ants all right it's like animal crossing

1034
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:50,340
but here's the best part about the game play it there's a character named shane that looks exactly

1035
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:57,060
like shane like it's identical i think he i think he kind of likes that yeah what are you doing in

1036
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:02,660
my game and apparently i think you can romance everybody in that game too you can so you should

1037
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:08,420
i could romance shane if i want to i'm not going to you should yeah but no it's not awkward just

1038
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:15,940
do it i have a cat so you're gonna romance the cat uh you know something did remind me actually

1039
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:22,260
i bought the nonary games because of shane oh his visit and and my gift is not here i know i'm almost

1040
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:27,060
like should invited by who's over here like he's the worst again shane has to get that bottle of

1041
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:32,340
wine from my house because i can't drink anymore but yeah it's it's a pretty good game i like it

1042
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:38,900
it's very relaxing it's just a very kind of i don't know it's very it reminds me so much of like

1043
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:45,380
animal crossing if it wasn't real time so like you can play the game you're basically knocking down

1044
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:52,020
trees and gathering resources crafting things and selling them running like a small little farm do

1045
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:55,860
you get to explore a lot yeah there's a ton of stuff to explore in the game there's like um

1046
01:22:56,980 --> 01:23:01,380
this whole area that they go around and actually i think there's different starting areas you can

1047
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:05,300
pick two so i just picked the basic one because it's my first time playing the game but they have

1048
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:10,900
different starting areas that are different geography and stuff so it's it's all right i

1049
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:16,340
mean it's a good relaxing game i guess um then of course yeah with the lego stuff i've been grinding

1050
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:21,860
at lego marvel superheroes 2 to unlock everything in the game and i say grind because it feels like

1051
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:27,780
you haven't unlocked at all no it takes me a while because my kids don't play it oh my kids play it

1052
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:31,780
my kids used to play like believe lego marvel games all the time but they won't play any of

1053
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:34,980
the levels so i have to go play through all the levels and lock everything and then they're like

1054
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:39,540
i'll play all these characters and then get bored with it we have all three of your kids

1055
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:45,140
they're like four and seven and a half okay similar to mine but mine are always like uh no

1056
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:50,260
mommy go over here no no why why do i because that's where you have to go they know the whole

1057
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:56,820
map no they just want to i honestly the lego marvel superheroes 2 i hate the open world map

1058
01:23:56,820 --> 01:24:00,900
they haven't actually lego avengers was better i think because at least they had manhattan in a

1059
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:06,580
bunch of other areas yeah that was a good one but this one's like chronopolis and shit all around

1060
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:11,540
but you know whatever i have a very important uh text message by the way i told shane he needs to

1061
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:15,380
listen to olr this week because he's come up twice and he put why i said this time on how

1062
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:21,540
loki says stardew valley shane is shane you he said everyone thinks that though except i'm not

1063
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:27,540
an alcoholic like stardew valley shane sure you are sure you are valley shane is also kind of

1064
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:33,540
mopey too so i know it's funny it's like hey shane it is all right anyway i just figured you'd

1065
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:37,060
appreciate that update but yeah so that's what i've been playing and then a little bit of ingress

1066
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:45,300
because i've been at parks how about more i don't see here's the problem i used to work later so

1067
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:51,940
i used to work a shift that was like 10 30 to 7 15 or something like that so i would have like

1068
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:56,020
about an hour and a half before i went from dropping my kids off to where i needed to be

1069
01:24:56,020 --> 01:25:00,740
the work and so i had all this time to play ingress and stuff and i just take a long time

1070
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:06,020
coming home and then i do all that but now i drop my kids off and i have to be at work like

1071
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:11,380
immediately and then coming home there's no time to play either because it's traffic and wake up

1072
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:17,940
earlier i can't because i have to take my kids to school and they are slow as hell you're ready

1073
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:21,700
no i gotta i gotta keep the show moving you'll have to do the sales pitch off air all right

1074
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:25,220
anything else for your gaming week logan that's it all right um let me check out our guest jen

1075
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:29,460
what kind of types of video games you've been playing this week well i always play uh like

1076
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:36,020
mind teaser type cookie jam and two dots every day every week um don't look at me like that snow

1077
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:42,420
in addition to ingress between cooldowns um but i in prep for the show i thought well i should

1078
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:48,900
play some like regular games right some first person shooter type things and i'm notoriously

1079
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:54,980
bad at these things like really really bad and uh so my kid set up his ps4 what is it that he has

1080
01:25:54,980 --> 01:26:01,300
right now ps4 yeah you hear how bad i am at this already right and um we were gonna play overwatch

1081
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:08,260
and we had not even i had not even gotten out of the training when he said to me you should stick

1082
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:16,740
to ingress mom um yeah it was really bad it was i mean i have a really hard time controlling your

1083
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:23,220
both your like where you're looking and where you're going so my guy ends up looking up or down

1084
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:28,260
a lot and then like sidewalking you know like everywhere he's going and falling off of mountains

1085
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:32,260
because i didn't know that there was a mountain there because i was sidewalking you know so i

1086
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:38,580
played overwatch for like 10 minutes and then he said he put me into a game like a live game with

1087
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:46,340
other people that was humiliating and he's a higher level so of course i should look like i

1088
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:52,260
know what the hell i'm doing and i don't i definitely don't so i said to him this is not fun and he said

1089
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:57,380
you should go play ingress uh phantasm chat over at live.vog network.com says get good

1090
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:03,140
that's what the kids tell each other who are bad rice did tell me that i needed to practice more

1091
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:08,660
that's my son bryce the nice the nice way yeah yeah so tori told me she got destiny too because

1092
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:12,820
her kid she actually she bought an xbox one don't get the wind out of her sail no call on

1093
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:21,780
hang on i'm going to call her because no because she's really good at it and i'm not um so i started

1094
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:25,780
playing it just because tori was going to play it i thought i'll play with my friend tori

1095
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:31,460
we're going to play i'll play with our kids it'll be great except that i suck so i started playing

1096
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:36,580
it and my husband sat next to me he goes this is embarrassing the whole time he was like this is

1097
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:41,860
embarrassing you suck you need to practice your husband said this oh my god he was the worst

1098
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:48,340
he was awful he was like you are horrible at this game you need to stop i can't watch this

1099
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:54,180
and they left the room and i said all right fine so i started playing dragon age inquisition just

1100
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:58,020
to get used to the controls because i figured i could run around there's quests and i'd get used

1101
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:01,940
to the controls and then i could play destiny too turns out i still can't play it because they're

1102
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:06,740
shooting at me and it makes me nervous so like i'm going around the corner and they're shooting

1103
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:10,740
at me and i hide and he goes you can't hide just run in there and just shoot at them i can't

1104
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:15,620
um i no i hide i just hide behind walls and stuff the whole time i'm like sneaking around

1105
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:20,260
that's a good way to stay alive exactly that's my point cover cover is a good thing to do yeah

1106
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:26,180
so then i duck down and i and i get my health back and i go shoot at them but i dragon age

1107
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:30,900
inquisition then sucked me in and i'm like 140 hours or something crazy in two weeks like it's

1108
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:36,020
insane i stayed up till like 5 30 in the morning one night because you know you just have to finish

1109
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:44,340
this quest right quotes and it took forever but i love it i'm level 19 now it's like two weeks

1110
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:48,260
and i played all the time and i just got admonished and told i can't play it while the

1111
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:55,060
kids are awake so apparently i'm playing it too much so uh yeah that's my week you playing a video

1112
01:28:55,060 --> 01:29:00,660
game too much 72 hours in downyville right i know right now it's like i'm on my couch i'm

1113
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:06,020
comfortable i have drinks available i have a bathroom right there it's fantastic so i like it

1114
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:13,220
i'm good at it i'm gonna replay it again that got some similar shakes of the head from berry like

1115
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:16,820
you're not playing this again i'm like yeah yeah i'm gonna play it again with a different character

1116
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:22,260
all right so a little peek in your gaming week snow oh and i tried destiny 2 a second time

1117
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:27,460
uh-huh i still hid i know how to control the character and i still hit i'm like they're

1118
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:32,900
shooting at me and they're scary so i'm hiding all right let me go to tori and ask about your

1119
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:37,700
gaming week tori i think you uh the snow spoiled it a little bit she pretty much you know what

1120
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:44,420
yeah pretty much usual but uh well i got an yeah i got an xbox so that i could play with my kids

1121
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:48,980
i've got two adult kids i want to throw in that i'm 57 years old uh and if y'all have ever seen

1122
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:54,580
she does not look at she doesn't look 57 and you know what how i bet i bet our chatters would have

1123
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:58,660
never known that if you hadn't said that because how awesome is that you are as hardcore as you

1124
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:04,900
are about a video game but you kind of defy the stereotype of a gamer so snaps for you oh thank

1125
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:09,220
you well but my eyeball i have adult kids and they both live out of state or two of them live

1126
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:14,500
out of state and they play this xbox thing so have y'all ever seen those videos like when they

1127
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:20,500
give a senior citizen an ipad and then they take video oh like elders react yeah yeah it's like

1128
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:26,500
yeah elders react that's what it is so that's what it's like with me with the xbox controller

1129
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:30,820
so i'm just like i want to shoot that thing and they're like no no mom don't shoot that thing

1130
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:36,660
and so i do a lot of the you know like spinning around uh forward backward and side like

1131
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:44,420
sidestepping but i do i have like jumped into the water a few notable times um it's it's a fun it's

1132
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:50,260
it's really a fun game i'm i'm getting better but uh yeah that's pretty much it it's it's more

1133
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:57,380
comical to watch me um but but i i enjoy playing and uh but yes ingress is gonna be more my thing

1134
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:01,220
playing with my kids is what's best okay so ingress is always gonna be your main squeeze

1135
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:05,540
but you know destiny is a good yeah perry potter might give it a run for its money though not sure

1136
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:09,380
where that's when that comes out what's gonna happen now if we get to pick from the four houses

1137
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:13,140
are you gonna be are you gonna be slithering with me or is it gonna be a new further in for life

1138
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:17,780
are you gonna be slithering oh hell yeah i'm gonna be slithering i'm always sort of slithering

1139
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:23,700
i'm gonna have to think about that this might be a family decision oh no oh i'm gonna do whatever

1140
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:29,940
i want fuck y'all so you're a good slithering already i don't think i like there was a test

1141
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:35,700
that i wasn't slithering i have one time tested ravenclaw i think i was raven i'm actually scared

1142
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:41,220
like if the pvp in harry potter is as intense as it is in ingress like people that are my friends

1143
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:45,380
today are going to become my enemies oh yeah you need to end those friendships right now yeah but

1144
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:51,300
then it's but then it's good well jen it was great having you know you you know for a fact we're

1145
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:56,980
gonna be like in the general channel like hey what is everybody choosing get out of our slack

1146
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:04,900
get off my lawn oh but then but then long time get out of my house long time frenemies from ingress

1147
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:09,300
may end up because we all thought that was gonna happen with pokemon go and then it turns out in

1148
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:15,380
pokemon go either a you just hate it or b um the teams kind of don't matter in pokemon they don't

1149
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:20,020
matter at all there's no scoreboards there's no game that's like hey look at all this stuff that

1150
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:23,700
we're gonna put out we're gonna put out brand new games like when are you gonna finish the last

1151
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:28,500
game you started because there's no game there okay i want to comment on that but i super want

1152
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:34,900
to keep it quiet there was that one game with the money locked up in las vegas that never went

1153
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:39,700
anywhere what was that thing called like end game oh end game yeah yeah that never happened no it

1154
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:44,340
ended yeah all right i played a different game what was it um there was a bunch of one i beta

1155
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:49,060
tested there's there's actually i became a little obsessed with ar gaming because of ingress i've

1156
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:56,660
tried them all i tried garfield go oh my god did you really it's did you have a hairball what the

1157
01:32:56,660 --> 01:33:02,500
i tried munzi munzi was munzi was okay because it was kind of like it's just more geocaching

1158
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:08,180
it's like geocaching gamified but the problem with munzi is that the the stops are all user

1159
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:14,260
generated which is fine but they're all like they were all made in 2002 2000 or 2012 2013 and they're

1160
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:18,500
all like the stickers are flooded away or they're gone so like all these things that the game says

1161
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:23,780
are there are not there and it's really frustrating did you try delta t yeah i did i can't

workbook i know right i'm joining next week i know no i have a rejoining to join that a cd

1178
01:34:54,980 --> 01:35:00,100
there is a thing called world of warcraft widows and my sister is a world of warcraft my husband's

1179
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:05,300
one uh wait he's a widow yeah because he's lost me to world of warcraft for a while

1180
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:11,380
and then i play farmhouse c14 which is basically the same thing

1181
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:16,100
said people don't know that one sorry i still have it except not as fun i've uh had a cough

1182
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:20,020
for like six weeks he's full of it he's just laughing so as far as like a new game i did

1183
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:24,500
try out the the open beta for final fantasy decidio because that's available on playstation

1184
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:28,420
4 i haven't turned on my playstation 4 forever so finally try fall past decidio which is like

1185
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:32,900
a fighting game with final fan yeah it didn't make any sense to me like i didn't understand

1186
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:36,900
i've tried playing the tutorial and i was like i don't understand what i'm doing like okay i

1187
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:41,620
need to hit the crystal to generate the summon power so i can summon things but like what what

1188
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:45,220
button now here's the thing i'm sure it's great for some people and some people were really into

1189
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:49,940
it but like i thought it was going to be like street fighter or tekken or one of those types

1190
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:54,100
of games with final fantasy i thought it would be ur guys basically and it's not so that was it's

1191
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:58,580
like complicated it was it was a little bit disappointing so that was that was i thought

1192
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:02,980
about it i saw that and i was like maybe i should go download that and then i got lazy it's more

1193
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:07,860
fun to watch playthroughs but i think you should you know it's because there is the open beta right

1194
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:13,540
now you can make a decision for yourself hey barry there's an open beta for a game download it free

1195
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:20,580
there you go i played the original on psp and it was all right and uh really get into it dragon

1196
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:26,100
ball has uh that dragon ball fighter what's it called dragon ball fighter z they had an open

1197
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:30,260
beta but it's had issues i think a lot of people have been having they've taken it back down i

1198
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:34,340
think for a little bit no no that's right betas have problems that's what happens that's why

1199
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:38,340
they're betas all right so that was a little bit of our game and it's all about beerus and that

1200
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:43,140
makes me happy because he's my favorite new character uh you have to check out the beta

1225
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:58,580
tried detroit is that a good place to get guardian i don't know i'm guessing i i don't think it's a

1226
01:38:58,580 --> 01:39:05,300
good place for i want to go to button willow have you tried north korea go to north korea i don't

1227
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:09,460
think they have portals there maybe they do we should check i got they do have portals in north

1228
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:14,660
korea what about gilroy my 110 day portal was in washington fucking dc like it wasn't you know

1229
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:20,900
it was just you had to kind of walk i got my i got almost 90 days just in the middle of sacramento

1230
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:25,300
so i mean and i know like some of our rez will make fun of us for it but they've gotten

1231
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:31,540
uh 150 in the area they'll get it next door to vernon sure yeah no i'm talking like on the river

1232

dougie fresh got his on the river oh wow that being said we don't really scrape him here either

01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:43,060
he was playing i know i love dougie fresh every dougie fresh 916 he's amazing um fantastic just

1234
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:48,180
going to the demilitarized zone area so there you go all right uh let me move on uh into some gaming

1235
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:51,220
news let's talk about what else is going on in the game world so we're gonna talk about some

1236
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:55,860
stuff that's not ingress but some other games hopefully y'all are y'all are familiar with let's

1237
01:39:55,860 --> 01:40:01,780
see loki this is a big one yeah so they had that that you know rumored nintendo direct it was like

1238
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:07,140
hey look we're doing one and here it is turns out some rumors are true yeah so there were some

1239
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:12,340
rumors uh not a whole i mean there was some stuff you know announced nothing like really huge i

1240
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:17,940
think so they had of course you know they're doing some additional content for super mario odyssey so

1241
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:23,780
it's like this multiplayer mode basically you get to hide a balloon or find a balloon and so they're

1242
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:29,300
going to have that um in the game and i guess based on finding those you get different outfits and

1243
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:37,380
stuff so that's the thing um and then of course you know along with that lots of ports being

1244
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:44,180
um announced for the switch so some of those uh the world ends with you final remix is coming um

1245
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:52,500
the ease eight the lacrimosa of donna hyrule warriors is getting a port donkey kong country

1246
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:59,060
tropical freeze and dark souls remaster obviously the big one so lots of ports um coming out pretty

1247
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:05,220
soon um but that's you know considering the switch has already outsold the wii u uh in japan anyway

1248
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:11,220
i mean that's it kind of makes sense especially for things like donkey kong tropical freeze i

1249
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:15,140
think a lot of people missed out on it would be interested in i wasn't as into it as other people

1250
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:19,860
but i understand why it's popular yeah i mean it's it's there's new stuff coming so that's kind of

1251
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:27,460
cool yeah um and then of course they're also doing a brand new um snk fighting game that's

1252
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:34,820
going to be coming to the switch as well so they have this um game called snk heroines tag team

1253
01:41:34,820 --> 01:41:39,940
battle and it's going to feature um the female cast from you know all their different fighting

1254
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:46,260
friends yes all their friends from friends from friends yes monica and rachel are in there right

1255
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:52,260
they're fighting you know what i'd really like is like a nintendo 64 style mario kart can we get that

1256
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:59,620
well uh if nintendo switch would ever announce virtual console uh you might be able to get the

1257
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:05,860
actual mario kart 64 i really want that i'm very good at that game you know what though seriously

1258
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:10,180
try if you ever do decide to invest in a switch like if maybe your kid how much are they they're

1259
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:15,860
not very expensive right uh 400 i think right now yeah you know why they're making this game i can

1260
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:20,980
tell you right now based on these screenshots it's the cell the skimpy clothing dlc oh yeah

1261
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:26,020
that's all there's a lot of nakedness going on right now it's all excels not here but in these

1262
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:31,300
screenshots remember if there's the doa 5 game that they had that they had the one that was kind

1263
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:36,900
of a piecemeal where you bottle the characters you bottle a dlc that's totally what this shit is

1264
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:42,260
is just a cash grab at that don't get me wrong it's great that the women of snk have a fighting

1265
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:47,620
game all to their own but let's be honest it's just to sell that dlc i was gonna say pod culture

1266
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:53,700
and chad is correcting me that it's 299 for the switch what is dlc download content like add-ons

1267
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:58,180
extra stuff you learn something new every day so yeah you get you get the base game and then oh

1268
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:02,980
hey you want that bikini that looks like um pineapples well that's going to cost you five

1269
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:08,100
bucks itty bitty teeny weeny yellow polka dot bikini basically itsy bitsy teeny weeny yellow

1270
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:13,940
polka dot but anyway i was gonna say i didn't get to finish my thought with with jen uh get

1271
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:19,060
mario kart 8 for the switch because even though it's like it's a lot of fun it's a lot of fun

1272
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:23,380
and it'll remind you of the so it like christmas time we normally pull out the nintendo 64 because

1273
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:28,740
we still have one that works but our new tv just like plays it black and white which is a very

1274
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:35,140
difficult play him the rumors you know supposed to be uh that the nintendo 64 game board are gonna

1275
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:39,460
be the next ones they're gonna classic mini four so they're gonna have really like that

1276
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:46,100
exclusive so if you could make it happen or you can just totally get um raspberries

1277
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:52,020
you can get a raspberry pie and stuff you can also what type of tv do you have um well it's

1278
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:55,540
i think that it was at my parents house i think it's a fancy one like the 4k ones

1279
01:43:55,540 --> 01:44:01,620
because um we've got ours to work on a 4k tv oh did you um have to i think use like a there's

1280
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:07,380
like a component converter oh you'd have to use i'll i'll see we'll exchange information and i'll

1281
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:11,540
find what you need yeah because we definitely were frustrated like you can't play battle on

1282
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:16,020
that going to best buy and ask they'll they might be able to help us this is the this is the rare

1283
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:19,860
case where radio shack would have been really helpful right there's still a couple of radio

1284
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:25,460
shacks in sacramento then that might be yeah yeah be the place to get them well my husband used to

1285
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:29,860
manage one so i have a he jumped he got out of that ship when it was sinking i have a ton of

1286
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:34,260
converters at home i don't remember if i have one that goes to hdmi i know i have several to go from

1287
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:40,580
vga to component or hdmi i may have one the only problem that you're going to run into using those

1288
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:44,820
converters because we also have one for our my husband and i have like 40 something video game

1289
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:51,540
systems um and we run into that with our super nintendo and our nes because it gives you like

1290
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:56,180
two seconds of lag in the game oh so which is fine like an rpg or something but when you're

1291
01:44:56,180 --> 01:45:00,740
playing something hardcore like the guardian legend which is my favorite game or mario kart

1292
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:06,580
yeah that i'm sorry but we are hardcore okay listen me and my sisters i think there is a

1293
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:11,460
retron that will do nintendo 64 i'll double check um jamie i want to ask you real quick though before

1294
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:16,500
you check um because you like fighting games you like snk you do a lot of snk games what do you

1295
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:22,180
think of the snk lady fighter game there's an snk lady fighter game you just mentioned it yeah

1296
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:31,460
no i announced a new switch fighting game it's going to be all their lady fighters i'd be down

1297
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:36,500
for that because yeah i mean i pretty much play all the lady teams anyway in kof so it's fine

1298
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:44,660
because my team is is my king and athena i love my mine's my favorite now we just need a doa

1299
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:52,900
snk and what the hell we can get uh rumble roses in there as well just cross game why not uh you

1300
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:58,260
know mud ring battle you could do snk versus capcom ladies edition all right we got to move

1301
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:01,700
on for time i'm going to go to the next story and talk about uh that nintendo although they

1302
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:05,540
are announcing all these uh new ports and likely to kind of fill in the calendar

1303
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:10,820
when they get their big big stuff like metroid prime 4 and all that uh one thing they're not

1304
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:16,420
going to be doing though anytime soon is 4k and virtual reality and you know what nintendo kind

1305
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:21,300
of does their own thing and they're doing really well with it hardware can't push that so exactly

1306
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:28,180
well uh the company uh was talking with a french publication les numeriques uh and uh the nintendo

1307
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:33,780
france uh had uh kind of reiterated that you know they're just he doubts vr is viable in a

1308
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:38,180
mainstream way and that consumers aren't going to want something that isn't a total package

1309
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:42,580
and it's the same thing with 4k the company does not see it as widely adopted as it should be

1310
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:46,580
for them to invest in it now keep in mind if i remember right nintendo was the last company

1311
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:53,540
to come around on hd tvs too the um the weu was the first hd because the we regular was only for

1312
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:58,420
was only 480p it did widescreen it didn't really do hd which is too bad like because you look at

1313
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:02,660
like the we games that they have and i mean i understand like in emulators you can upscale that

1314
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:09,620
stuff really well and it looks nice yeah and that's you know and kind of unfunny enough 4k

1315
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:16,340
you know they have the weu version of zelda um that is upscaled to 4k if you have the system

1316
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:22,020
that can run it and it looks nice yeah so it wouldn't be a terrible thing to do that but

1317
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:26,260
yeah i understand there's not a lot of people are going to be paying for a system that's that

1318
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:31,780
expensive to run those games they'll put out 4k system like when everybody's jumping to 8k or

1319
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:38,340
something like that okay i need a special edition of this snk heroines game because you can get a

1320
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:45,620
terry bokor hat that says fatal cutie oh i love that oh and that's great uh dark circle won't

1321
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:53,140
you go to our next story pikachu oh it's a pokemon story sorry guys but pokemon is much

1322
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:58,580
more than a mobile game right no well there is going to be as if anyone's surprised by this

1323
01:47:58,580 --> 01:48:09,060
a 2ds xl that is going to be wait why did i say 2ds it's a 3ds xl um that is uh did i read that

1324
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:13,780
right it's a 2ds it's a 2ds okay i thought i was misreading that for a moment but they're doing

1325
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:19,780
an all pikachu one is got a cute pikachu face on it and it's even got a puffy pikachu nose on it

1326
01:48:19,780 --> 01:48:27,540
and is pika it's so cute although it would be cuter if it was pichu but yeah it's supposed to

1327
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:37,060
come out on january 26th for 159.99 although if they did an animal crossing one i would drop

1328
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:43,460
everything and get that so what is animal crossing it's the best thing ever you you move into a

1329
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:48,180
on the new one anyway you went to the village and suddenly like oh shit you're the mayor

1330
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:53,300
and you have to make friends with all the animals and do fetch quests for them and grow trees and

1331
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:56,820
sell stuff and make your town better i have a perfect village still and i haven't played in a

1332
01:48:56,820 --> 01:49:01,780
year it's like the sims but they're all cute animals it used to be based off of a good game

1333
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:07,140
where they actually had it where you could buy nes how do you feel about it okay the nes games were

1334
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:13,780
only in that one version on the gamecube right and we all and we all love that game best for

1335
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:22,340
some reason i do anyway well i i i i owned all of those games so i didn't care i could just go play

1336
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:27,860
them on my nintendo what's the game with like the music and everything like all the jumps have to do

1337
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:35,060
the music elite beat agents i think about jumps have to do with the music elite beat agents no

1338
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:41,780
it's like a critter and it goes along and there's all kinds of rock music and rock fan if you can

1339
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:47,220
no it's like a thing if you can jump like you figure out the the music the beat you can jump

1340
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:54,020
to all the beats that is bit trip runner i think you're wrong never mind i'm wrong she's thinking

1341
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:59,220
of the one that uh yeah the chat berry will tell us the playstation game the one where it's uh

1342
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:02,420
it's got beck music in it i don't remember what the hell it's called it's not vibrant

1343
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:08,020
not vibrant no it's uh

1344
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:20,580
it's fantastic and it like it's all has to do with the music and my six-year-old is amazing at this

1345
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:27,140
game spice world no you're wrong it's not spice world sound shapes no you're okay never mind this

1346
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:33,060
is another good answer from yyr the music levels in rayman rayman that's it ding ding ding a cookie

1347
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:41,220
for yyr bingo yes my six-year-old could beat the whole game he's amazing at it and i love when he

1348
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:46,820
plays it because i like the music i love music and video games so do we that's how the show

1349
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:51,860
just started we were all ddr people playing dance dance revolution years ago are you serious i am

1350
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:58,340
what what what ingress is to all of us now like ddr was for the three of us years ago it's totally

1351
01:50:58,340 --> 01:51:05,060
rayman and i will like i will listen to any video game they play it has good music we need to

1352
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:10,100
introduce you to like bust a move and i know we need no we don't we need to have a coach snow day

1353
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:16,100
it's ps1 era but it's so much fun the music in that game is top notch i can already bust a move

1354
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:21,380
but but it makes my kids cringe but i can do it you've got music from like all kinds of genre

1355
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:26,980
and different dancers in the game that represent like okay you do have the fetish girl um is there

1356
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:32,340
ice ice baby no ice uh uh actually one of the ddr's on we i think did have that song

1357
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:38,020
yes right it's so good for embarrassing your kids right let me if jamie's all done talking about

1358
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:44,340
the pikachu ds which somehow led to rayman uh snow you're very good at tangents you fit in

1359
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:49,940
you fit in really well here one of us i'm a goddamn squirrel same with us i still want

1360
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:55,220
this fatal cutie hat look see so is she so you know birds of a feather all right loki what is

1361
01:51:55,220 --> 01:52:01,380
what's our next story in the you know who asked for this news hyperkin is bringing back the duke

1362
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:05,540
controller what's a duke controller controller is the controller can house a small family that

1363
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:11,780
was part of the original xbox system oh the one that could be used as you know yes to inflict

1364
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:16,180
blunt force trauma yes somebody's trying to take my portal i could throw one of these at them

1365
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:21,540
so yes um apparently you can get one of those they're gonna be coming soon you could use it as

1366
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:30,100
so yeah um neat i guess it's gonna be priced for 69.99 and be compatible with the xbox one

1367
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:35,140
in pc expensive not for controller nowadays don't talk while you're eating this

1368
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:42,020
so yeah that's kind of interesting um although another thing though that they are putting out

1369
01:52:42,020 --> 01:52:48,180
that people might be more interested in is they're doing their own game boy so it's it

1370
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:55,860
actually looks exactly like an original game boy or game boy color i guess um and yeah i guess it's

1371
01:52:55,860 --> 01:53:00,820
gonna play the game boy games and everything i mean practically looks identical it's kind of

1372
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:07,860
like a retron but for game boy it's the hyperkin's emulation is kind of crap yeah i mean i don't know

1373
01:53:07,860 --> 01:53:11,540
i think the attendant might be a little bit upset about this considering that i would assume that

1374
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:16,500
they're gonna put out a you know game boy mini or something like that at some point i'm just

1375
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:22,100
irritated because um one of the one of the pages and magazines i used to subscribe to was mental

1376
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:29,060
floss and they said look the next console the next thing that nintendo is releasing is this

1377
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:34,740
and i'm like no it's not it's hyperkin and it's going to be crap because hyperkin's emulation

1378
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:40,180
is flawed if if the graphics aren't messing up the music is messing up if the music's not messing up

1379
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:44,900
then it has something to do like you'll get artifacting on the screen their emulation is

1380
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:49,860
completely wretched and i would just wait for nintendo to do their thing or get a raspberry pie

1381
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:55,780
but honestly i'm considering how hard it is to find their systems and i don't know i would you

1382
01:53:57,060 --> 01:54:04,340
i love seeing how this turns out they apparently though it even has like i mean you can an optional

1383
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:10,340
backlight on there so you can turn the backlight on and off and even they said they're customizing

1384
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:17,300
to basically also work with uh you know artists that use these for chiptunes so build the you

1385
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:22,980
know what is chiptunes it's like making music out of like the retro um sound chips that are

1386
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:27,060
in these systems so everything sounds like you know music that was on the system can you get

1387
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:33,060
it on spotify probably they have some probably artists that are on spotify just checking um

1388
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:36,420
anyways they're saying that they're trying to aim for a price point under a hundred dollars

1389
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:45,540
and should be coming out probably relatively soon um is that worth a hundred dollars oh hell yeah

1390
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:49,780
for playing gameboy games can't find original gameboy anymore it has a six hour battery and

1391
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:54,820
unless you go to the thrift store and have good luck snow snow this is an example of a chiptune

1392
01:54:54,820 --> 01:55:00,740
from a real popular band wait we gotta wait for it to take it let me fast forward here where it

1393
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:09,940
kicks in this is endless fantasy by adamanaguchi for those that know uh so basically i could play

1394
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:15,940
anything

1395
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:24,820
yeah but i would not pay a hundred bucks for it well it's it's more of just a system a lot

1396
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:29,540
of making chiptunes a lot of these artists will modify carts and stuff to be able to

1397
01:55:29,540 --> 01:55:34,020
generate those tones and they'll so they can use the actual hardware that's in the systems

1398
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:39,300
but it's more for people to want to play games like tetris because that's whatever we use

1399
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:44,980
i never should have let my ex take my game boy here's what i'm thinking like i like games i

1400
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:50,500
might have an extra i'll take it that's why they like to do these retro things for people that

1401
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:55,940
lost them uh orange right in chat at live dot vog network.com says fun fact that new duke controller

1402
01:55:55,940 --> 01:56:00,500
actually plays the original xbox boot up when you click the center button that's kind of neat

1403
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:06,980
i like that if you ever did you ever have an original xbox yeah yeah it plays well no anyway

1404
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:12,020
all right let's move on let's talk about noises because i was really excited about i hate noises

1405
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:18,660
you hate noises i have three kids well your kids are probably going to be very interested in this

1406
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:23,860
and this is something that you might be able to play on that uh new 3ds and this is the trailer

1407
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:31,700
this is pokemon yes but this is pokemon that you might like i don't know tim don't tell me

01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:56,820
although people will come over and bring their switch and be like i need to unlock everything

looking for a giant collection that is should be larger than any human should have jamie is going

1433
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:19,700
to go to the next story while i take snow on a tour of the house okay okay so for the people who

1434
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:26,580
are still playing gravity rush um too you should all be happy that the uh shutting down their

1435
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:34,260
server was postponed because people fussed online the way stuff happens they were gonna close it on

1436
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:41,060
january 18th they announced this back in september but because of people fussing about it it will be

1437
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:49,700
up until july 18th at 10 p.m pacific time um but when the servers go down you will no longer be

1438
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:58,660
able to view leaderboards or collect any special content or send challenges um but basically

1439
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:07,140
sony listened to the fans so um and this was all from a uh it looks like a campaign that started

1440
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:14,740
from a fan uh community called gravity rush central so there you go that's good they actually

1441
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:22,100
have a following for that game it's it looks neat i tried i think i like the art style some of that

1442
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:28,420
i i vaguely remember but it was i don't know it's a different game but the whole hashtag was

1443
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:32,580
don't forget gravity rush i'm glad it worked and that they were able to kind of save that i think

1444
02:00:32,580 --> 02:00:36,820
that's really cool because they pulled that fast so they're threatening to pull it really fast so

1445
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:43,060
well september was when it was announced so that's a few months but i mean the game had only been out

1446
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:48,980
like a year or so i mean yeah yeah okay so that a quick update on introducing snow to amiibos so

1447
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:52,420
finally i showed her what she's supposed to be looking at and the first words out of her mouth

1448
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:58,580
were oh so they're skylanders i'm like yes they're just kinda oh my god we had some of those then

1449
02:00:58,580 --> 02:01:02,100
she's like what do they do and i'm trying to explain it to her and she goes oh so it's lego

1450
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:08,420
dimensions i'm like yes it's that so she knows what they are she's we have so many lego dimensions

1451
02:01:08,420 --> 02:01:12,820
there you go that's it's that i love lego games see i only want the lego dimension stuff just for

1452
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:17,940
like having the figures they're just so expensive i want to buy all of them no no here's the deal

1453
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:22,980
you go to target because lots of targets will put them on discount yeah i know i here's the deal

1454
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:30,020
i got all of my lego dimensions including the entire system when it was 75 no wait sorry target

1455
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:38,420
70 off and there was a cartwheel so i got them at like 90 off yeah some of those sets were at

1456
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:43,380
the 99 cent store for a while there's right so like i got all these things and i pretended to

1457
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:48,500
my kids that they were super expensive and then now they play them that's my fear i can't bring

1458
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:54,020
that home because my wife would get pissed right pretending pretending that something was expensive

1459
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:59,140
is 90 of being a parent you're right i would know i only have a cat all right we gotta we're two

1460
02:01:59,140 --> 02:02:02,900
hours into the show and haven't even gotten to the break yet so i do and we have a we have a

1461
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:06,100
kind of a big deal about to happen here on orange long trade open i'm not gonna give it away we're

1462
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:11,060
gonna get there soon so loki you up next all right so let's talk a little bit about uh the xbox one

1463
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:16,820
again so they're going to be getting an update um that's adding some things including uh mini hubs

1464
02:02:16,820 --> 02:02:21,300
and a way to basically put yourself in a do not disturb status so like if you're playing your

1465
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:26,180
games and people keep messaging you to do stuff you'll totally ignore all that or i guess that'd

1466
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:30,980
be kind of helpful if you're watching netflix or something like that um so that's cool and of

1467
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:38,660
course you know uh the mini hubs i guess that's basically now you can access the games hub content

1468
02:02:38,660 --> 02:02:44,500
shared by other players in the world without leaving your own game so i don't know why you

1469
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:51,620
would need to do that but it's a thing now so cool you have that that's neat um then of course there's

1470
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:55,940
a little bit of a rumor that's talking about the new system as well that perhaps they're going to

1471
02:02:55,940 --> 02:03:02,980
be adding a new system for achievements so they're saying along with they're going to add new

1472
02:03:02,980 --> 02:03:08,580
achievement system called careers to sell to basically go alongside the current system and

1473
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:14,660
this is more for like players that play a game for a long time so like not only do you get

1474
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:19,620
achievements for playing you know games and you max that stuff out but you can also get stuff if

1475
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:25,860
you're continually playing a game um so with that they're also going to have i guess you know uh

1476
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:29,220
focus based on that i heard there's a rumor also that they're saying that they're possibly going

1477
02:03:29,220 --> 02:03:36,900
to have avatar loot crates what does that mean a loot crate is basically when you buy something

1478
02:03:36,900 --> 02:03:42,820
within so like pokemon go i guess if you were gonna you know say like that or even ingress

1479
02:03:42,820 --> 02:03:47,780
because they have in-game currency in that so you buy this in-game currency and you get a box and

1480
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:51,220
it's random what's in the box there's a chance you'll get something good there's a chance you'll

1481
02:03:51,220 --> 02:03:57,940
get something that's kind of like those doggies not no not free but cryptocurrency but like more

1482
02:03:57,940 --> 02:04:02,660
of like um think of it like the box like it's random it's like you're gambling you might get

1483
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:08,260
something like awesome like a very rare link amp or you might get like 10 bursters i am super not

1484
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:14,580
i am not doing that i don't like blue boxes either but anyway so basically what they're saying though

1485
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:19,300
i don't think you can necessarily purchase those you just get them when you rank up in this thing

1486
02:04:19,300 --> 02:04:24,260
so you get additional like customization for your avatars because they have a whole new avatar system

1487
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:31,620
um neat but i just hope that they don't use this to exploit you know paid paid loot boxes because

1488
02:04:31,620 --> 02:04:37,460
they kind of did that with forza and it wasn't very good so okay you know what pisses me off

1489
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:46,020
in pokemon go yeah when i pay yeah i'm gonna tell you anyway so suck it up so like if i pay for like

1490
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:53,380
the incense and a creature shows up and then it runs away fuck you i paid for that like why you

1491
02:04:53,380 --> 02:04:58,660
paid for the chance yeah no no i paid for the creature to show up it better not run away

1492
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:02,900
that pisses me off it's like the raid pass you pay for the rate pass and you don't even catch the

1493
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:07,140
stupid pokemon it runs away i have never done that that's right because you you said your your area

1494
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:12,180
is too remote you don't get to do the raids no i do raids i just can't get legend oh i can't get

1495
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:18,500
legendaries yeah no i can do raids but i can spin a ball like a motherfucker so like i always catch

1496
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:24,980
the pokemon but like i get more creatures running away when i do incense than i do regular so i

1497
02:05:24,980 --> 02:05:29,540
don't even use it it's always the shitty creatures too like pikachu like no it's a goddamn pidgey

1498
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:34,260
and the pidgey runs away like what the fuck i paid for you pidgey get in get in the ball

1499
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:39,540
maybe one way you can help maybe one way you'll be able to find some people for uh these pokemon go

1500
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:43,460
raids is through something that niantic rolled out this week i thought this would be a nice

1501
02:05:43,460 --> 02:05:48,420
bookend the ingress conversation uh niantic announced this week uh a community day for

1502
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:52,980
pokemon go uh this is not going to be like their chicago event that was a total meltdown

1503
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:57,540
they got a hundred dollars worth of pokey coins please make it like the chicago event

1504
02:05:57,540 --> 02:06:02,020
uh but what happened is on their blog they announced that january 20th would be the first

1505
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:07,060
pokemon go community day where they're calling on players to meet up at local parks and landmarks to

1506
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:10,740
meet up with people basically they want to capture the magic when the game first rolled out so they're

1507
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:15,700
encouraging hey everybody meet up here at this place in time and to encourage you to go out

1508
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:21,620
you will be able to catch loki's favorite a special pikachu this pikachu will know surf and

1509
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:25,540
that's a special move that i don't know if it actually surfs or what it does that's a new move

1510
02:06:25,540 --> 02:06:31,860
apparently it does uh oh that's pretty rad though um so then also i guess uh increased xp or stardust

1511
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:36,980
lure modules uh so anyway the whole thing is going to be from and these are that can vary depending

1512
02:06:36,980 --> 02:06:42,900
on the event uh the americas will see this event from 11 a.m to 2 p.m pacific time on the 20th so

1513
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:46,740
uh we'll be out there with ingress flyers recruiting i'm just kidding although actually

1514
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:52,500
it's not a bad idea i know yeah we were talking about if you play ingress please bump the park

1515
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:57,620
if we're down at capital park it's not going to be that high in your park wouldn't you like your

1516
02:06:57,620 --> 02:07:03,140
eight there you go go to pioneer park and get your your people to by the way i'm safe i just

1517
02:07:03,140 --> 02:07:07,300
opened pokemon because you said that it says it's extreme weather conditions but i'm pretty sure

1518
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:15,140
it's extreme cloud hazardous weather alert because it is too clear it's too clear outside it's an

1519
02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:20,260
extreme warning about wednesday's rain all right yeah exactly anyway one more thing about pokemon

1520
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:26,340
go and this is a little bit controversial uh they are dropping support for older ios devices

1521
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:31,940
so if you are unable to upgrade your phone to ios 11 you will not be able to continue to play

1522
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:38,340
pokemon go note i'm not saying you have to have ios wait a minute phone it's just that i iphone

1523
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:43,620
5s and prior will no longer work aren't they getting a lawsuit about not updating those old

1524
02:07:43,620 --> 02:07:50,500
phones that's the whole battery thing that came out it's not really related to pokemon go but

1525
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:54,580
that was just that's just another thing that i guess i could say as a whole apple's trying to

1526
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:59,300
work through right now and they put out a statement there are three pokemon in your driveway

1527
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:02,180
yeah you know i get a lot of pokemon that spawn here it's it's exciting

1528
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:08,020
jamie's instantly picking up her phone and trying to catch the boogaloo um i know this is not a

1529
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:13,860
popular one not opening it by the niantic developers however it's not unheard of in the

1530
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:18,260
gaming world um you know when they release new world of warcraft expansions although they try

1531
02:08:18,260 --> 02:08:23,060
to get as many games as possible to work they will say you know if you're not above a certain

1532
02:08:23,060 --> 02:08:27,780
benchmark the game's no longer going to work and i mean with consoles i think we kind of see that

1533
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:32,180
inherently is like they stop making games at some point for the xbox 360 and you kind of have to

1534
02:08:32,180 --> 02:08:36,740
have an xbox one so this isn't but it's just i think this is weird for people because we haven't

1535
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:42,260
seen this as much in the phone world so we're seeing it all the time in the world can we talk

1536
02:08:42,260 --> 02:08:48,660
about things we hate about pokemon go and it's not like a graphically intensive game it's

1537
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:52,740
graphically intense it overheats my phone well that's because there it doesn't have to i don't

1538
02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:57,460
think it's so much the graphic side of it is it is the you know the internet and the memory usage

1539
02:08:57,460 --> 02:09:01,860
because you know it's the memory usage it's the it's really is the memory usage because there's

1540
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:05,780
a lot of stuff going on under the hood i want to talk about creatures we hate and i won't even

1541
02:09:05,780 --> 02:09:10,260
catch fuck them all right no we got to move on i will not catch another one of those stupid

1542
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:14,820
parasite things we got to move on because we're going to get to another segment here at olr we're

1543
02:09:14,820 --> 02:09:19,620
finally to the end of the first half and no it is it's time dark soccer i don't want to do it but i

1544
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:24,180

1549

1557
02:10:44,820 --> 02:10:52,500

1558
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:56,180
that she would do halo well first i've got before you get into your usual segment because you're

1559
02:10:56,180 --> 02:11:02,020
going to treat this like any other game i am but um even though it sucks stop it but i just want

1560
02:11:02,020 --> 02:11:06,820
to say like personally though like i and you know i told you this last week i said jamie you know

1561
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:10,260
what we're probably not going to get that kind of money from the listeners you might want to just

1562
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:14,980
lower the expectations and all this stuff but like you all came through like you really did

1563
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:21,380
and i'm just i am like so humbled that this show like and the people that listen to it like did

1564
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:27,380
that i am i'm i'm like i almost i kind of i kind of had an ugly cry we're gonna put it in we'll

1565
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:32,820
put it in our community and i will send the link to the res community as well thank you my goal

1566
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:38,980
on the gofundme is 7 500 which would take care of my mom for a while she and i don't say this

1567
02:11:38,980 --> 02:11:45,300
she lives in a barn a literal barn does she leave the door open huh does she leave the door open

1568
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:52,660
no no no because where you're born in a barn is a thing in my house but she she she lives in um

1569
02:11:52,660 --> 02:11:56,580
a little apartment is built into a former barn that's the storage building for the people in the

1570
02:11:56,580 --> 02:12:00,980
property and it's a really pretty property but my mom doesn't have a lot of money and a lot of

1571
02:12:00,980 --> 02:12:06,100
resources and certainly not any of the wonderful programs we have here in california that help

1572
02:12:06,100 --> 02:12:13,060
people because they voted for fucking republicans sorry anyway anyway so to dial it back let's

1573
02:12:14,020 --> 02:12:20,580
let's not um let's not okay i will so the game tell us about the classic game of the week halo

1574
02:12:20,580 --> 02:12:27,540
it is halo combat evolved um there actually something about halo is that when um my husband

1575
02:12:27,540 --> 02:12:32,660
had his bachelorette party it was basically just a bunch of people with a bunch of x-boxes all

1576
02:12:32,660 --> 02:12:39,540
hooked up on land playing halo that was his bachelor party we watched zanadu and barbarella

1577
02:12:39,540 --> 02:12:45,940
and rob was there and we went to a goth club that was my bachelorette party and it was fun anyway

1578
02:12:45,940 --> 02:12:52,980
um halo came out in 2001 it is a military themed sci-fi first-person shooter that was developed by

1579
02:12:52,980 --> 02:12:59,700
bungee and published by microsoft game studios um it is the first it is a franchise launcher and it

1580
02:12:59,700 --> 02:13:07,380
was the killer app for the xbox um come out on november 15 2001 it has sold more than 5 million

1581
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:16,820
copies worldwide by 2005 um they've even done windows versions mac versions um a series of

1582
02:13:16,820 --> 02:13:23,300
novels comic books a live action web series and of course they're the spawned the one thing about

1583
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:30,180
halo that i like red versus blue because red versus blue was fucking hilarious anyway um

1584
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:38,500
it uh it has had a high death remake in halo combat evolved anniversary it came on xbox 360

1585
02:13:39,140 --> 02:13:47,300
and it was re-released as halo the master chief collection on november 11th 2014 for the xbox one

1586
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:53,700
um it is set in the 26th century and you play as the master chief who has from what i understand

1587
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:58,580
his whole thing that made him awesome has since been retconned now that bungee is no longer

1588
02:13:58,580 --> 02:14:07,380
in the picture rip um so he has an ai that that lives in his his suit or his brain or something

1589
02:14:07,380 --> 02:14:14,900
called cortana that microsoft has also adopted a cortana into their own little personal version

1590
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:20,900
of siri which is not nearly as good as siri um you know for windows systems and you know

1591
02:14:20,900 --> 02:14:27,940
windows phones right um a lot of people have put it up there as one of their favorite games ever

1592
02:14:27,940 --> 02:14:33,380
and it is considered by ign to be the fourth best first person shooter ever made and if

1593
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:40,980
if quake isn't the first one then i'll cry um and yeah there was a lot of machinima that came out

1594
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:45,540
a lot of stuff that was supported by bungee and microsoft you know red versus blue being the big

1595
02:14:45,540 --> 02:14:52,020
one um so basically you've got like energy shields and you can drive tanks you can do a whole bunch

1596
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:56,660
of shit that you're not supposed to in the game like super jumping using using your tank to get

1597
02:14:56,660 --> 02:15:01,700
to places that you're not supposed to go because that's all the stuff that i like um you know your

1598
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:09,940
shields will recharge but you have to fight these like enemies called the covenant and they are

1599
02:15:09,940 --> 02:15:15,940
these different aliens that are bound together with some religion and you have to basically

1600
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:22,660
fight you know what's the other one called the flood these insect creatures um but you're on this

1601
02:15:23,620 --> 02:15:32,100
world that is a quite literal ring and you're on the inside of this world um of the ring and

1602
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:36,660
this i thought it was a really neat game graphically i wanted to like it

1603
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:43,380
didn't like it sorry i suck at first person shooters especially like the nintendo 64 era

1604
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:50,180
up through the xbox severe motion sickness motion sickness but um

1605
02:15:52,500 --> 02:16:01,060
but i mean you play you know your master chief who's named john i think um and you have cortana

1606
02:16:01,060 --> 02:16:07,380
and you've got you know the captain of the game you have like other people and there's

1607
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:15,620
wasn't there a character who um crap who was it that they got someone to do his likeness

1608
02:16:15,620 --> 02:16:22,340
and then he came back in halo 5 i don't remember my husband pointed it out to me and i don't

1609
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:34,340
remember um but i mean basically you are over on um on this planet for some reason i'm trying

1610
02:16:34,340 --> 02:16:39,860
to get to where the actual plot is because i don't know who cares about the plot kill everything

1611
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:45,780
shoot it down did it move shoot it yeah basically you're trying to i guess take control of the halo

1612
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:51,700
and figure out what its purpose is and so you go all over and shoot shit and then things are done

1613
02:16:52,740 --> 02:17:00,340
that's it all right that's it okay shooting all right but no wait there's more all right um it

1614
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:06,900
did go through a pretty decent uh development cycle and they were actually going to in 1999

1615
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:14,100
it was actually announced um at the mac world conference that halo was going to be released on

1616
02:17:14,660 --> 02:17:21,620
classic mac os and windows simultaneously um but there was a big uh non-disclosure agreement

1617
02:17:21,620 --> 02:17:28,100
that you know prevented anyone from really talking about it but it was shown um at a

1618
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:36,420
private showing at e3 1999 and people like yay this is great um and then uh the first trailer

1619
02:17:36,420 --> 02:17:43,700
came out at e3 2000 and then you know basically from there it evolved um the soundtrack but i'm

1620
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:51,220
combat evolving great i is not intentional um but it does have a really amazing soundtrack

1621
02:17:51,220 --> 02:17:54,980
i will give you that i mean the soundtrack for halo is something that i can listen to for a while

1622
02:17:55,700 --> 02:18:02,340
but i mean it had pretty great scores across the board it was well received and of course now we've

1623
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:08,420
got so many other versions of it you know that have you know been released since then you know

1624
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:13,620
like i said this was a franchise starter um and then of course um for machinima you had

1625
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:22,660
red versus blue that came out um you had uh you know different you know types of mods that came

1626
02:18:22,660 --> 02:18:29,860
out for for the pc you have uh there were the novels that came out there was a prequel novel

1627
02:18:29,860 --> 02:18:36,180
other novels that came out one about the flood um comics all kinds of stuff that came out

1628
02:18:36,980 --> 02:18:43,780
in fact marvel did a uh a halo graphic novel that came out they also remade the game

1629
02:18:44,340 --> 02:18:49,380
and like i said it's had multiple re-releases so there you go are you happy yes yes

1630
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:56,500
halo is classic game of the week i've watched my kid play a lot of halo it really happened

1631
02:18:56,500 --> 02:19:02,180
episode 714 halo really knows like my kids can play halo it's one of the games i'll let them play

1632
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:07,540
yeah no even the six and eight-year-old they can play it hey rob well they're not having sex

1633
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:13,540
chupa thingy so like it's okay chupa thingy chupa thingy what about chupa thingy it's got a ring to

1634
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:24,420
it all right um but but um i know that some people wanted me to stream it so um as soon as i figure

1635
02:19:24,420 --> 02:19:29,140
out how to get that done i might make another incentive we may well i know you probably want

1636
02:19:29,220 --> 02:19:32,740
to do it for your own channel but you could always come over and we can stream we might have to fudge

1637
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:37,860
it a little bit and do like the halo uh anniversary collection on xbox one i think people will still

1638
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:42,100
be satisfied with the result we'll have you but i might make it another incentive and by the way

1639
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:49,860
that 500 came from four people so the last donation was 200 and i i mean yyr was one of

02:23:20,660 --> 02:23:27,220
welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live with episode number 714 already in progress for

1680
02:23:27,220 --> 02:23:33,140
this excuse me january the 14th of 2018 rob roberts here with you in studio with dark

1681
02:23:33,140 --> 02:23:38,980
sakura as well as loki so our guests tonight the uh lovely ladies here that play ingress locally

1682
02:23:38,980 --> 02:23:44,820
this is really funny so um the nearby portal not too far from here they had uh put their resonators

1683
02:23:44,820 --> 02:23:49,540
on it on their way in and uh it started getting attacked during the break so they actually ran out

1684
02:23:49,540 --> 02:23:54,180
there to go talk to the people that were attacking it and i don't know what they're doing out there

1685
02:23:54,180 --> 02:23:59,300
but they're uh they're out there playing the game right now um i think it's probably also going to

1686
02:23:59,300 --> 02:24:03,540
really kind of throw our competition for a loop like why are all these heavy hitters at rob's

1687
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:08,020
place right now so uh it'll be fun to see what that's about but if they knew that i was

1688
02:24:08,020 --> 02:24:13,220
broadcasting then they probably thought oh they're all distracted right now let's go put blue over him

1689
02:24:13,220 --> 02:24:16,180
so we'll see what happens with that so that's actually what they're out doing right now is

1690
02:24:16,180 --> 02:24:20,180
having fun with that but we still have plenty more news to cover and i'm sure we'll hear all about

1691
02:24:20,180 --> 02:24:23,300
whatever's happening outside right now as they're they're actually playing the game right now but we

1692
02:24:23,300 --> 02:24:29,460
have some rapid fire news to get to uh let's get to loki all right so let's talk about games that

1693
02:24:29,460 --> 02:24:34,500
are going to be coming out pretty soon on steam and these are kind of cool because i've actually

1694
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:40,020
played a few of these on my phone so space invaders extreme and groove coaster are going

1695
02:24:40,020 --> 02:24:45,300
to be heading to steam um so space invaders extreme is going to be coming to steam in february

1696
02:24:46,180 --> 02:24:51,940
and then groove coaster uh they don't have a date yet when that's coming out sometime in spring

1697
02:24:51,940 --> 02:24:58,660
though but two really good kind of music hybrid games uh or arcade kind of even arcade-y type

1698
02:24:58,660 --> 02:25:03,460
games coming to steam so i definitely will have to check those out when they come out because i did

1699
02:25:03,460 --> 02:25:09,620
like those um and then hopefully this makes this game even better and i still haven't gone back

1700
02:25:09,620 --> 02:25:16,500
since they've done all the updates but um no man's sky of course you know game it took a while to

1701
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:21,780
kind of get back to the hype that they were you know how they were showing the game in 2013

1702
02:25:21,860 --> 02:25:30,500
well still not quite there but you know thanks to uh modders that may be not the case pretty soon so

1703
02:25:30,500 --> 02:25:37,780
there's um a mod out there called ray rods overhaul um it's a no man's sky mod that's supposed

1704
02:25:37,780 --> 02:25:45,780
to turn the game into something that appears to resemble what they showed at on the e3 2013 show

1705
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:49,940
when they're i think it was the e3 i think maybe the game's um awards i don't remember when they

1706
02:25:49,940 --> 02:25:55,940
first debuted that but they have um an early version of it available now to download so you

1707
02:25:55,940 --> 02:26:00,980
can go check that out on moddb and there's basically a lot of interesting stuff they're

1708
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:07,620
doing so new ecology and terrain more colors more random events more dynamic weather and they're

1709
02:26:07,620 --> 02:26:12,580
said right now though of course being that it's still very early um there's still some bugs in

1710
02:26:12,580 --> 02:26:17,540
there to work out um so they're still doing that it's only one guy putting it together so it might

1711
02:26:17,540 --> 02:26:22,100
take a while but at least it's kind of you know nice to see a little bit more variety in some of

1712
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:28,740
the plans it creates so if you're interested in checking out like i said go to moddb to find that

1713
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:37,220
mod sweet so i am very much looking forward to uh the the not to backtrack too much but i'm very

1714
02:26:37,220 --> 02:26:40,420
much looking forward to the space invader stuff that's coming out on steam yes i just didn't get

1715
02:26:40,420 --> 02:26:45,300
that out there because i'm texting the gals since they're playing chris um but uh yeah i really want

1716
02:26:45,380 --> 02:26:49,780
to check out because um i mean i love the game on on psp and i think express 360 and i just i think

1717
02:26:49,780 --> 02:26:54,580
it'll be fun to have on pc as well so because you know i love to buy games on multiple systems

1718
02:26:54,580 --> 02:26:58,740
and then um what was i gonna say um because i don't see this as part of the show role the

1719
02:26:58,740 --> 02:27:03,620
other thing i wanted to mention though um along with that um oh no it was actually part of it i

1720
02:27:03,620 --> 02:27:09,860
just forgot to mention it so aside from space invaders and um groove coaster there's another

1721
02:27:09,940 --> 02:27:16,980
game coming final fantasy 12 is going to be coming out on steam as well so definitely you know check

1722
02:27:16,980 --> 02:27:23,380
that out so uh pretty cool the zodiac age and that's coming out february 1st on pc and they

1723
02:27:23,380 --> 02:27:28,820
said that that version of the game will run at 60 fps include a new game plus a new game minus mode

1724
02:27:28,820 --> 02:27:34,100
the fuck's new game minus um i think that's something about like you don't level at all

1725
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:41,060
because you can get through that game i think being at level one but it's hard huh yeah okay so

1726
02:27:41,780 --> 02:27:47,460
very cool lots of cool games coming out in the next few weeks yep all right let's get to uh

1727
02:27:47,460 --> 02:27:51,700
speaking of games coming out soon this is like a re-release i guess you could call it of final

1728
02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:59,220
fantasy 15. final fantasy 15 is getting a royal edition uh final fantasy 15 has been already rated

1729
02:27:59,220 --> 02:28:05,140
t and it's leaked via the esrb uh perhaps this is an unannounced collector's edition with the

1730
02:28:05,140 --> 02:28:11,140
base game and dlc episodes as the game has uh expanded into these different uh gladius and

1731
02:28:11,140 --> 02:28:17,300
prompto and ingus all have their uh ignis excuse me all have their little uh uh extra episodes that

1732
02:28:17,300 --> 02:28:22,020
are in the game so uh yeah they're probably doing like a okay now the game is finished collection i

1733
02:28:22,020 --> 02:28:27,380
think is what's going on there so uh yeah that's uh something to look forward to um maybe like a

1734
02:28:27,380 --> 02:28:31,540
summer e3 release i don't know that's a question mark it could be any time really during the year

1735
02:28:31,540 --> 02:28:37,780
so um we'll see what comes to that uh also um even though my link for this isn't working so

1736
02:28:37,780 --> 02:28:41,300
i'll just try to do this from memory loki you might have to help me out but i know assassin's

1737
02:28:41,300 --> 02:28:45,620
creed rogue got announced for a remaster and that's going to be coming to playstation 4 and

1738
02:28:45,620 --> 02:28:50,580
xbox one the one thing i don't have in front of me is is there a date for that i don't know i didn't

1739
02:28:50,580 --> 02:28:55,940
post that yeah and i'm not sure about that um so maybe somebody in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

1740
02:28:55,940 --> 02:28:59,940
knows the answer to that i don't think we had a date yet but it has been announced that those

1741
02:28:59,940 --> 02:29:05,060
games are getting remastered and that'll be exciting for uh people obviously the uh graphics

1742
02:29:05,060 --> 02:29:08,740
and assassin's creed have come a long way and that's what we're seeing in the xbox one and

1743
02:29:08,740 --> 02:29:14,980
playstation 4 versions right now so meanwhile let's move over to dark sakura well there is

1744
02:29:14,980 --> 02:29:21,060
going to be a star wars multiplayer shooter that's coming out on mobile phones uh star wars rivals

1745
02:29:21,060 --> 02:29:26,100
has already had a soft launch in australia and new zealand um but it will be out for ios and

1746
02:29:26,100 --> 02:29:33,140
google play um it's a little bit more on the overwatch side of gameplay but you can buy

1747
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:36,580
something for 100 bucks in the game but it ain't darth vader you get him from the get-go

1748
02:29:37,540 --> 02:29:44,180
assassin's creed remastered our rogue remasters march 20th thank you and oh you had to give me

1749
02:29:44,260 --> 02:29:53,380
this um stephen spielberg is still working on a halo tv series and it hasn't progressed any

1750
02:29:53,380 --> 02:29:56,820
i gave that tour before i knew what the classic game of the week was going to be by the way because

1751
02:29:56,820 --> 02:30:02,900
i thought oh i'll work it in somehow i did that for y'all still in development nothing new

1752
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:10,660
it's still happening eventually maybe allegedly all right our uh anger scouts haven't come back

1753
02:30:10,660 --> 02:30:14,180
from their portal battle yet i hope the uh opposition didn't kill them while they're out

1754
02:30:14,180 --> 02:30:20,260
there so we'll see i do want to take this on a small tangent since you're talking about tv

1755
02:30:20,260 --> 02:30:26,180
series did you guys see animaniacs is coming back yes i did the first seasons are on hulu and same

1756
02:30:26,180 --> 02:30:31,540
thing with the tiny tunes right yeah i heard though they might not have the same voice actors

1757
02:30:34,740 --> 02:30:38,660
i thought one of the voice actors tweeted or something that they weren't a part of it i i i

1758
02:30:38,660 --> 02:30:42,260
i'm going off memory and i don't have anything in front of me i thought i saw something on twitter

1759
02:30:42,820 --> 02:30:50,500
which obviously makes it true it was on twitter uh about that so um based on my uh my

1760
02:30:51,700 --> 02:31:00,020
coms stuff they're still battling the portal still still great all right well uh moving on

1761
02:31:00,020 --> 02:31:03,220
uh let's get to some release dates we're going to travel around the world and check out what

1762
02:31:03,220 --> 02:31:07,700
is coming out uh in a country near you uh we'll start with the us yes there's not a whole ton of

1763
02:31:07,700 --> 02:31:12,580
stuff coming out in january but there's a few things so starting off we have a game called

1764
02:31:12,580 --> 02:31:18,820
inner space that's coming out on windows mac the antenna switch playstation 4 and xbox one i don't

1765
02:31:18,820 --> 02:31:23,140
think this has anything to do with the old uh sci-fi movie about shrinking down to someone's

1766
02:31:23,140 --> 02:31:30,500
body um curveball space program enhanced edition coming out on playstation 4 and xbox one uh one

1767
02:31:30,500 --> 02:31:35,460
notable game that is coming out this week as well street fighter 5 arcade edition on pc and

1768
02:31:35,460 --> 02:31:42,820
playstation 4 and then we also have a game called a gintama rumble that's on playstation 4 world to

1769
02:31:42,820 --> 02:31:52,020
the west that's on nintendo switch and last but not least um a few more here death mark which is

1770
02:31:52,020 --> 02:31:58,980
for the switch and playstation 4 digimon story cyber sleuth hackers memory on playstation 4

1771
02:31:58,980 --> 02:32:06,180
nvita and finally on 3ds kirby battle royale traveling over to japan a lot of the same stuff

1772
02:32:06,180 --> 02:32:09,700
you just heard here in the us usually it's a little different but in japan on the playstation

1773
02:32:09,700 --> 02:32:14,580
4 this week in tama rumble is out there as well uh we also have street fighter 5 gets the arcade

1774
02:32:14,580 --> 02:32:18,660
edition in japan as well so that game is getting kind of a second chance i think with a lot of

1775
02:32:18,660 --> 02:32:23,300
people a lot more characters there with all the included stuff uh sheen is coming out in japan in

1776
02:32:23,300 --> 02:32:28,740
a regular and limited edition as well and a price reduction on senju novakiri a remaster

1777
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:34,660
so that is something else to look forward to uh looking at the other consoles in japan real quick

1778
02:32:34,660 --> 02:32:40,020
i know sometimes the vita still gets releases in japan and we do have that gintama rumble is in a

1779
02:32:40,020 --> 02:32:44,420
regular and av edition on the vita this week as well they also have a game releasing on the vita

1780
02:32:44,420 --> 02:32:49,540
called ephemeral fantasy on dark that is also releasing in japan this week on the vita because

1781
02:32:49,540 --> 02:32:54,100
they still love the vita in japan even though it kind of disappeared and fumbled here it was

1782
02:32:54,100 --> 02:32:58,740
all right i wish they'd do it in console though i know uh this is kind of a big deal for japan

1783
02:32:58,740 --> 02:33:02,900
because we've had this game for a few months but this week japan is finally getting and it's the

1784
02:33:02,900 --> 02:33:07,620
lone release on the switch this week mario and rabbit's kingdom battle is making its way to japan

1785
02:33:07,620 --> 02:33:11,700
this week i didn't have that yet yeah i was surprised they didn't get that either but

1786
02:33:11,700 --> 02:33:16,180
considering that was a game developed over here i can see why maybe it's uh taking a little bit

1787
02:33:16,180 --> 02:33:23,140
of time and uh that's it no 3ds releases in japan this week uh nothing until uh actually it's it's

1788
02:33:23,140 --> 02:33:27,460
pretty empty honestly until we get to like february so 3ds slowing down a little bit in japan

1789
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:34,340
in the meantime though we do have the uk on the 15th we have street fighter 5 arcade edition for

1790
02:33:34,340 --> 02:33:41,780
pc on the 16th we have beholder for ps4 and interspace for switch ps4 and xbox one on the

1791
02:33:41,780 --> 02:33:48,260
17th we have the vanishing of ethan carter for xbox one and on the 19th beholder for xbox one

1792
02:33:50,260 --> 02:33:56,740
of course the thing i care about is january 26th so coming soon dragon ball fighter z i know i know

1793
02:33:57,940 --> 02:34:03,140
all the hype is leading up to this moment and apparently the hype is worth it when they can

1794
02:34:03,140 --> 02:34:10,260
connect to the game yes in the beta all right beta uh go into our chat over at live dot vog

1795
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:15,140
network dot com panda and chat agrees i wish they made more games for the vita yeah i mean

1796
02:34:15,860 --> 02:34:21,460
you can get some from japan and import them but yeah here uh they they just kind of they got they

1797
02:34:21,460 --> 02:34:25,940
slowly got rid of the uh playstation television they slowly kind of phased that whole thing out so

1798
02:34:26,740 --> 02:34:31,620
it's a problem with sony over there uh let's see also in chat at live dot vog network dot com um

1799
02:34:31,620 --> 02:34:37,060
oh rama says original voice actors for animaniacs were confirmed by rob paulson my mistake sorry

1808
02:35:26,500 --> 02:35:33,940
back hi yyr um hello lr on last week's show you mentioned the discontinuation of connect adapter

1809
02:35:33,940 --> 02:35:39,380
for xbox one i apologize for the length of this email but i need to express how disappointed i

1810
02:35:39,380 --> 02:35:46,180
am in microsoft for how they've minimized connect and their early adopters who still make use of it

1811
02:35:46,180 --> 02:35:51,540
some context i bought my xbox one on launch day and started using the connect voice commands

1812
02:35:51,540 --> 02:35:56,180
almost immediately at first they seemed silly but soon i was using them constantly to switch to

1813
02:35:56,180 --> 02:36:02,340
other apps or games to control my tv navigate streaming apps and more i only need needed to

1814
02:36:02,340 --> 02:36:07,700
pick up a controller if i wanted to play a game my voice could do everything else the most amazing

1815
02:36:07,700 --> 02:36:14,580
of these voice commands was xbox select this command assigned a number to every selectable

1816
02:36:14,580 --> 02:36:21,300
element on the screen you could then say item one item two etc to select any of those things

1817
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:25,380
the awesome thing about this command was that you could use it almost anywhere from system settings

1818
02:36:25,380 --> 02:36:31,220
to browsing the store to browsing netflix or other streaming services you could do it all with just

1819
02:36:31,220 --> 02:36:36,660
your voice well you could for three years but just this past fall with no warning and no

1820
02:36:36,660 --> 02:36:41,700
explanation microsoft pushed a system update that disabled the xbox select command and all third

1821
02:36:41,700 --> 02:36:47,220
party apps it wasn't replaced it wasn't updated it was simply disabled the functionality totally

1822
02:36:47,220 --> 02:36:52,420
removed for seemingly no reason at all now navigating streaming apps is no longer possible

1823
02:36:52,420 --> 02:36:57,220
without a controller this is a slap in the face to the folks who came to love this technology

1824
02:36:57,220 --> 02:37:02,260
especially disabled gamers who had become accustomed to easy functional voice navigation

1825
02:37:03,940 --> 02:37:09,060
now we've just witnessed the discontinuation of the xbox one connect adapter but here's

1826
02:37:09,060 --> 02:37:14,500
something you may have missed the connect adapters have not been available for microsoft online store

1827
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:21,460
since before the xbox one x came out this means that early adopters of the xbox one are now being

1828
02:37:22,260 --> 02:37:26,660
punished for also being early adopters of the one x because they never had

1829
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:32,260
a chance to buy an adapter at all as an original xbox one owner who was considering upgrading to

1830
02:37:32,260 --> 02:37:37,540
an x i am now faced with the prospect of having to ditch what connect functionality i still have

1831
02:37:37,540 --> 02:37:42,580
or the prospect of never being able to upgrade to an s or x for a company that has embraced

1832
02:37:42,580 --> 02:37:47,620
backwards compatibility with software dating back two generations this seems awfully backwards in

1833
02:37:47,620 --> 02:37:53,940
a different way how is how is it that amazon apple and other others are expanding their

1834
02:37:53,940 --> 02:37:58,580
voice recognition technologies well microsoft seems bent on rolling theirs back all right

1835
02:37:58,580 --> 02:38:04,500
rant over back to testing super multitasking i guess thanks for listening erin yyr all right

1836
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:08,180
i forgot to mention i played super multitasking this week as well that was something i played

1837
02:38:09,220 --> 02:38:13,460
still hard even with controller but yeah i totally agree this is kind of fucked up

1838
02:38:14,420 --> 02:38:21,460
so um i mean this is actually seems like they would have to either have something built into

1839
02:38:21,460 --> 02:38:27,460
the system for voice recognition or i don't know but i would expect there to be a slew

1840
02:38:27,460 --> 02:38:32,260
of complaints directed at microsoft for getting rid of you know voice recognition i mean

1841
02:38:33,780 --> 02:38:41,940
you've got players who and like i said that are disabled there are people who have poor vision

1842
02:38:42,020 --> 02:38:46,660
who use the console who might rely on their voice recognition to get them to

1843
02:38:46,660 --> 02:38:53,540
the game you know things like that i i totally agree yeah i mean this is it kind of ties into

1844
02:38:53,540 --> 02:38:57,380
the whole uh thing we were talking about just a minute ago with like sony has abandoned the

1845
02:38:57,380 --> 02:39:02,740
playstation vita right and so now microsoft has kind of like abandoned connect you know in a way

1846
02:39:02,740 --> 02:39:07,460
although not in japan with the vita but i guess with the connect it was never an issue in japan

1847
02:39:07,460 --> 02:39:12,260
but it's it sucks for the early adopters it really does you're you're a follow-up i was

1848
02:39:12,260 --> 02:39:18,740
gonna say um you can use the headset with a microphone for um voice control as well

1849
02:39:19,940 --> 02:39:27,620
but um the only exception is um hey cortana you know xbox on only works with the connect

1850
02:39:27,620 --> 02:39:34,100
so that's the only thing you can't do with the you know without the connectors turn the system on

1851
02:39:35,060 --> 02:39:37,620
well that's kind of helpful to have the machine on don't you think

1852
02:39:39,380 --> 02:39:43,460
isn't it always on sucking up your brain it's always listening it's always on you know

1853
02:39:43,460 --> 02:39:47,540
downloading those updates for quantum theory that all right so that's it for emails this week

1854
02:39:48,980 --> 02:39:54,420
all right sounds good all right we're gonna uh get back here so um snow is walking back into

1855
02:39:54,420 --> 02:39:58,580
the studio except she decided to bring mr smoosh with her because you loved a kitty don't you snow

1856
02:39:58,580 --> 02:40:04,660

1857
02:40:04,660 --> 02:40:07,860
obviously we're talking about ingress earlier in the show and clearly something is happening

1858
02:40:07,860 --> 02:40:11,940
because i'm going to our chat room over at live.vog network.com and i'm getting messages

1859
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:16,180
on my phone right now they're saying and it's it's from somebody claiming to be and i don't know if

1860
02:40:16,180 --> 02:40:19,940
it is or not somebody must have gave her the link it's gonna be claiming to be pepper it is pepper

1861
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:23,940

1865
02:40:40,180 --> 02:40:44,580

1866
02:40:44,580 --> 02:40:48,820
once think they kind of have i don't know how much i should say i think there's kind of reasons they

1867
02:40:48,820 --> 02:40:53,540
went blue in the first place like relations and all that stuff family okay so how's your knee

1886
02:42:39,700 --> 02:42:44,180

1887
02:42:44,180 --> 02:42:52,660

1889
02:43:00,100 --> 02:43:05,060
this is why the show is not video that's for sure i saw you buy berry once and i accidentally

1890
02:43:05,060 --> 02:43:09,540
no because underwear the the only blue i've got on right now is protecting you

1891
02:43:11,700 --> 02:43:15,140
what do you mean protecting yeah what if i want it what if i want it

1892
02:43:15,860 --> 02:43:21,700
omg what is happening here in this studio right now all right where's allen anyway so did you

1893
02:43:21,700 --> 02:43:26,660
guys have fun back there i saw him did you keep it clean out there no yes three why are you playing

1894
02:43:26,660 --> 02:43:30,900
grand theft auto wait define oh i just got that for my kid against my better judgment

1895
02:43:31,860 --> 02:43:38,180
what i sure did oh my god you have to punch a hooker to get your money back he doesn't he

1896
02:43:38,180 --> 02:43:45,220
assures me he's not punched any hookers yes i'm sure he hasn't i don't know man i don't know

1897
02:43:45,220 --> 02:43:51,620
apparently there's a clean version no no no no there's not so he's lying to me then yes if

1898
02:43:51,620 --> 02:43:56,820
you're listening i know you're lying to me now you are no longer playing grand auto if there is

1899
02:43:56,820 --> 02:44:00,180
i sure as hell i've never heard of it maybe there's a mod or something but i guess there was

1900
02:44:00,180 --> 02:44:05,780
he said there was something where there weren't any hookers i know okay he's okay so he's he's

1901
02:44:05,780 --> 02:44:10,660
doing what kids do and he's kind of like explaining the truth so the original version of grand theft

1902
02:44:10,660 --> 02:44:15,140
auto had like a scene that you could hack that was called the hot coffee scene that was basically

1903
02:44:15,140 --> 02:44:19,460
where you would end up having sex with a hooker oh my god but the esrb kind of found out about that

1904
02:44:19,460 --> 02:44:24,340
so they had to remove it from future copies of the game so is it the cleaner version sure because

1905
02:44:24,340 --> 02:44:28,420
they took that one scene out that you couldn't even access anyway without hacks but is the game

1906
02:44:28,420 --> 02:44:34,740
all so did so if you go back to him and you go why'd you lie to me a little shithead technique

1907
02:44:34,740 --> 02:44:39,620
shithead i call him that i didn't lie i didn't technically he didn't technically think grand

1908
02:44:39,620 --> 02:44:44,020
thought online i'm not sure if they have hookers and grand thought online i know the strippers have

1909
02:44:44,020 --> 02:44:49,940
uh bikinis on online whereas offline they don't have bikinis i'm pretty sure he's playing online

1910
02:44:49,940 --> 02:44:56,180
okay did anybody ever play leisure suit larry in the land of the lounge of course of course thank

1911
02:44:56,180 --> 02:45:02,020
you when i started the whole goal of the game is to have sex to the hooker yeah well in grand

1912
02:45:02,020 --> 02:45:07,380
theft auto there's like you can run into hookers with your car like that's a whole thing wait a

1913
02:45:07,380 --> 02:45:13,540
minute that's just in the game yes because i've done that in real life no you have it for the

1914
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:19,300
record she has not done this i didn't say i hit them i said i ran into them but yeah no he started

1915
02:45:19,300 --> 02:45:24,980
playing that game in the last couple weeks i uh i apparently well i went out to on fat on black

1916
02:45:24,980 --> 02:45:30,740
friday and not knowing all of his games i just so racist in front of what black friday black

1917
02:45:30,740 --> 02:45:37,860
friday when you get all the deals racist no snow omg i'm gonna take that mic away yes please do

1918
02:45:37,860 --> 02:45:43,220
anyway i stood in front of the like you know deals at the of the video games at walmart and i just

1919
02:45:43,220 --> 02:45:48,420
bought every game that i thought he might not have that you went to walmart listen it's in my town

1920
02:45:48,420 --> 02:45:53,860
and so we um he actually did really well he only didn't have he only had one of the games that i

1921
02:45:53,860 --> 02:45:59,780
bought him so we exchanged that one for grand theft auto and again against my better judgment

1922
02:45:59,780 --> 02:46:03,140
i don't know i just let him do whatever he wants at least you sort of let him have an economic

1923
02:46:03,140 --> 02:46:09,140
lesson with that right i i'll put this up when i was a kid i've watched every movie i wasn't

1924
02:46:09,140 --> 02:46:14,020
supposed to see as a kid sure i played all of the things i wasn't supposed to play as a kid

1925
02:46:14,660 --> 02:46:18,580
and i listened to everything i wasn't supposed to listen to how many hookers have you run over

1926
02:46:18,580 --> 02:46:23,380
i've not run over a single hooker yet i ran over a squirrel once and that was sad but that

1927
02:46:23,380 --> 02:46:28,340
was probably i don't know rob you were there with me i was what you were wait what movies did you

1928
02:46:28,340 --> 02:46:35,220
watch like well okay my mom's last week my mom was forbidden to watch my mom took me to see star

1929
02:46:35,220 --> 02:46:40,660

1930
02:46:40,660 --> 02:46:46,260
remember looking through the um the little glass door in the theater in the 70s

1931
02:46:47,140 --> 02:46:52,180
so i have the vague like i mentioned something my mom she's like you were nine months old wow

1935
02:47:10,980 --> 02:47:17,060
was my favorite movie as a kid okay so fact my dad okay so my grandfather was dying and my mom

1936
02:47:17,060 --> 02:47:22,180
went to san francisco my dad was watching us and he took us to the video store because you know he

1937
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:27,060
didn't want to actually watch us so we rented a bunch of videos and there was this movie i had

1938
02:47:27,060 --> 02:47:32,100
been wanting to see forever and it had a black panther on the front of it it was called cat people

1939
02:47:33,380 --> 02:47:39,060
right that was the one with the with the the mom yeah and the cat people so my dad let us

1940
02:47:39,460 --> 02:47:49,780
happen to my show my dad talking about old shit and it was okay so in the movie the people had

1941
02:47:49,780 --> 02:47:54,900
sex and then they turned into black panthers had to kill someone and when they killed someone they

1942
02:47:54,900 --> 02:48:01,700
turned back into people so after that my mother found out we watched it and she didn't let my

that's not double it's almost double math is hard i know but technically i guess right now 150 games

1966
02:50:03,700 --> 02:50:08,740
there's a tendency to exaggerate things in gaming uh you know especially when like selling things

1967
02:50:08,740 --> 02:50:12,340
and marketing things uh just look at the ramp up for the game no man's sky there was a lot

1968
02:50:12,340 --> 02:50:17,140
of exaggerations there just like jen's kid is giving her exaggerations about how clean

1969
02:50:18,100 --> 02:50:23,460
to say that most of those games coming out are good because a lot of them are terrible but

1970
02:50:24,180 --> 02:50:29,220
there are some pretty good games on playstation vr um so yeah i'm looking forward to that you know

1971
02:50:29,220 --> 02:50:33,780
hopefully they don't release new hardware anytime soon although i have a feeling they're gonna do

1972
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:39,860
something like that um and then of course you know speaking of hardware um htc announced that

1973
02:50:39,860 --> 02:50:46,580
they've got a new vive coming so this is the vive pro which has got a higher resolution screen in

1974
02:50:46,580 --> 02:50:52,340
it and then they also had a wireless adapter to go along with that so you can also take that and

1975
02:50:52,340 --> 02:50:58,260
make it wireless which is pretty awesome all along with the improved screen the vy pro is also going

1976
02:50:58,260 --> 02:51:04,180
to have a built-in headphones and their own dedicated amp dual mics and they even redesigned

1977
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:12,020
the head strap and it looks blue it's fancy so um that looks awesome i definitely want to check that

1978
02:51:12,020 --> 02:51:18,340
out i still haven't picked up a pc vr headset yet but that doesn't look like a bad option i still

1979
02:51:18,340 --> 02:51:22,420
don't have a playstation vr and i kind of want to like i'm ready to adopt some sort of vr but it's

1980
02:51:22,420 --> 02:51:30,020
just honestly like and don't do it resist now that most of the uh uh ingress gals are seeing my house

1981
02:51:30,020 --> 02:51:35,460
for the first time tonight uh i don't need any more shit in this house is that correct you need

02:51:45,700 --> 02:51:49,860
people tops and tonight we have one two three four five six i was planning on seven so no one

1985
02:51:49,860 --> 02:51:54,580
really wants a tv tray to hold her drink i know it's a which by the way i have a tv tray to hold

1986
02:51:54,580 --> 02:51:58,980
my drink can i beg about can we talk about just real quick just uh you know here's a little here's

1987
02:51:58,980 --> 02:52:02,740
a little fun fact since uh now i know some members of the other team are listening here's a little

1988
02:52:02,740 --> 02:52:08,420
fun fact about sacramento enl so so um somebody decided to bring boxed wine no it's a box no it

1989
02:52:08,420 --> 02:52:14,580
was a box it was a boxed wine i i decided no it wasn't target wine it came from target target

1990
02:52:14,580 --> 02:52:18,900
why it was from walmart she just went there she said no i didn't go to walmart for the wine i

1991
02:52:18,900 --> 02:52:23,700
went to target for the wine excuse me excuse me okay so anyway so the important part is is that

1992
02:52:23,700 --> 02:52:27,940
you know i i get asked oh do you have a glass that i can put the wine in i'm sure i'm like sure i

1993
02:52:27,940 --> 02:52:33,140
have up here here's a wine glass no no no i said do you have a clean glass you know you said a

1994
02:52:33,140 --> 02:52:37,460
clean glass i give you a wine glass because that is what wine glasses for is wine no and then she

1995
02:52:37,460 --> 02:52:43,220
said oh i want that here a mason jar it's really hard to drink wine out of mason jars no it's not

1996
02:52:43,220 --> 02:52:49,140
you can't knock a mason jar over like now they are all drinking wine out of mason jars all did

1997
02:52:49,140 --> 02:52:57,540
tori drink you had wine too we're out of wine yeah i know that i'm really mad that's unfortunate but

1998
02:52:57,540 --> 02:53:01,140
i bought i've only brought two bottles you want to know what's sitting in my fridge though right

1999
02:53:01,140 --> 02:53:06,900
now that's a crime that i can't better be wine well yeah i have wine in my fridge too but i have

2000
02:53:06,900 --> 02:53:12,580
a bottle of my favorite milk stout because i'm a beer person what is milk stuff i feel like i

2001
02:53:12,580 --> 02:53:19,540
need to try this i don't it's it's it's a stout i mean like a beer like like a guinness's but

2002
02:53:19,540 --> 02:53:24,660
it doesn't have the same bitterness the the lactic acid in it makes it a smoother flavor so it's not

2003
02:53:24,660 --> 02:53:34,180
that sharp like it's very but it's it's fermented out of it so it's like gassy beer snow be quiet

2004
02:53:34,180 --> 02:53:38,580
no okay sorry it's not it's not quite like that but it's it's very smooth i mean it's it's

2005
02:53:38,580 --> 02:53:44,180
definitely got the the heft of a stout but um there is a brewery called belching beaver brewery

2006
02:53:44,180 --> 02:53:50,580
and they make it oh my god you know it peanut butter milk stuff i have tori is something

2007
02:53:50,580 --> 02:53:54,180
tori set off over here the peanut butter milk stout is my favorite but i have their plain

2008
02:53:54,180 --> 02:53:58,980
milk stout in my fridge which i also super like and i cannot drink it for another six months

2009
02:53:59,620 --> 02:54:03,220
i probably won't even be able to finish it and that makes me very sad it's sitting in

2010
02:54:03,220 --> 02:54:11,060
there taunting me like drink the beer i'll take your beer okay i i just want a little bit of it

2011
02:54:11,060 --> 02:54:18,660
i miss i miss my beer okay so we got from virtual reality to uh beer alcohol problems alcohol is

2012
02:54:18,660 --> 02:54:23,700
talking to us yeah i just was noticed she's listening so my phone is going off and what i

2013
02:54:23,700 --> 02:54:28,260
love is that i'm getting a message that says why can't we drink box and i said it was fine it's

2014
02:54:28,260 --> 02:54:33,220
fine you you i said why are you a bad frenzy remember i didn't buy box wine because remember

2015
02:54:33,220 --> 02:54:40,660
tip it in chemistry alcohol can be the solution i do believe 100 a certain person in the pacific

2016
02:54:40,660 --> 02:54:47,940
northwest is called the baron of boxed wine listen i almost bought boxed wine but no the

2017
02:54:47,940 --> 02:54:52,660
selection that i wanted to bring it would have been like really expensive so if i'm bringing

2018
02:54:52,660 --> 02:54:58,500
sutter's home or barefoot to an occasion is it really that different no it was some other brand

2019
02:54:58,500 --> 02:55:04,900
it was like a target brand of target one i told you it was no what i brought was apothic red

2020
02:55:04,900 --> 02:55:09,700
and some other one dark horse rosé okay if you want to know what kind of wine i drink

2021
02:55:10,420 --> 02:55:15,460
because menage a trois has too much merlot i like the apothic red more than a menage a trois i'm

2022
02:55:15,460 --> 02:55:21,700
sorry all right really menage a trois is good to cook with okay so now we're on menage a trois and

2023
02:55:21,700 --> 02:55:25,380
i have a story about steam we're supposed to get to but jamie really got to get back to video

2024
02:55:25,380 --> 02:55:30,740
here but no red wine is as good as boujale all right video games well maybe uh you have found

2025
02:55:30,740 --> 02:55:36,340
uh over your just like there's many thousands of types of wines out there there's many thousands of

2026
02:55:36,340 --> 02:55:42,260
types of games available on steam in fact according to an unofficial aggregator called steam spy

2027
02:55:42,260 --> 02:55:49,220
in the year 2017 7 672 games were released on the digital service that's a lot of games a lot of

2028
02:55:49,220 --> 02:55:53,620
those are probably shit no literally it's probably poop simulator 2017 that's probably

2029
02:55:54,180 --> 02:56:01,060
what you know is this type of game is being released uh that is by the way 2472 more games

2030
02:56:01,060 --> 02:56:07,620
than the year prior and 40 of the entire steam library came out in the past year yeah getting

2031
02:56:08,420 --> 02:56:16,900
greenlight was a great idea so uh yeah now valve is stuck with do we curate steam games do we rely

2032
02:56:16,900 --> 02:56:22,740
on algorithms what do we do how how do you make sense of the mess that is the steam store quickly

2033
02:56:22,740 --> 02:56:26,580
because i know it's always algorithms that's always the answer that's what youtube does it

2034
02:56:26,580 --> 02:56:32,500
works so well for them too you don't you don't make the problem is that they've already opened

2035
02:56:32,500 --> 02:56:39,060
the floodgates it's already flooded with poop and so what are you gonna do it they need to bring

2036
02:56:39,060 --> 02:56:44,180
back green light again all right uh just a few more stories here and then we're gonna open up

2037
02:56:44,180 --> 02:56:47,860
the skype line at orange lounge radio all one word on skype but first dark sakura

2038
02:56:48,740 --> 02:56:55,140
oh yeah i got more shit to do don't i well this is happy news this is good news because

2039
02:56:55,700 --> 02:57:01,780
honestly i wish i could have found this person and punched him in the dick okay i'll help you

2040
02:57:03,540 --> 02:57:09,300
um not just punch him with my fist but like make the infinity gauntlet a real thing and punch him

2041
02:57:09,300 --> 02:57:15,940
with you know like the time gem or something so that they shrink up anyway um the guy who

2042
02:57:15,940 --> 02:57:22,900
did the swatting call that got someone murdered um has been charged with involuntary manslaughter

2043
02:57:22,900 --> 02:57:27,460
wait back up what all right do you know what swatting is snow has not been paying attention

2044
02:57:27,460 --> 02:57:31,860
to the news all right basically it's when you say that someone at a certain address

2045
02:57:31,860 --> 02:57:38,580
has like a what like a gun or bomb or something imagine if you're playing call of duty with a

2046
02:57:38,580 --> 02:57:44,500
friend and you make a one dollar and fifty cent wager and somehow you know that friend uh tanks

2047
02:57:44,500 --> 02:57:49,780
the game for you and so you get mad at them so the mature thing you do is you call in a fake

2048
02:57:49,780 --> 02:57:56,420
um hostage threat to the police that's not mature no of course it is you pay the buck 50 you will

2049
02:57:56,420 --> 02:58:02,020
know sarcasm it's it's you know the sarcasm is thick with it's reality so you you call in the

2050
02:58:02,020 --> 02:58:08,340
fakes the the fake um you know hostage or bomb threat so the swat team shows up at your house

2051
02:58:08,340 --> 02:58:12,660
and scares you or whatever except you know this person of course that's going to be the recipient

2052
02:58:12,660 --> 02:58:17,140
of this gives them a fake address they go to a person's house the guy's like what the fuck's all

2053
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:22,660
this noise outside looks outside you know puts his hands up puts his hands down gets shot killed and

2054
02:58:22,660 --> 02:58:27,540
then his family has to walk over his dead body horrible yeah that's what happened with this guy

2055
02:58:27,540 --> 02:58:33,220
the one who made the clotting is not a fucking game that's a real thing yep yeah oh my god we

2056
02:58:33,220 --> 02:58:37,300
were just bitching about ingress like seriously that's why my reference earlier when i mentioned

2057
02:58:37,300 --> 02:58:42,660
spotting it's like you know the same kind of there's no reason for that shit no well what

2058
02:58:42,660 --> 02:58:48,020
happened with this guy the the guy's name is tyler barris he was charged in kansas for involuntary

2059
02:58:48,020 --> 02:58:57,220
manslaughter and two other counts after his um swat call uh led to the death of the 28 year old

2060
02:58:57,220 --> 02:59:06,580
in his home um he will be facing um a big fine and quite a lot of time in prison although it

2061
02:59:06,580 --> 02:59:12,500
can vary from case to case um but he had called saying that there was a hostage situation um on

2062
02:59:12,580 --> 02:59:19,300
december 28th that had his family at gunpoint in the house being doused with gasoline and he gave

2063
02:59:19,300 --> 02:59:24,740
them the address for a guy named andrew finch who was shot and killed by an officer when he opened

2064
02:59:24,740 --> 02:59:28,820
the door the officer is also an administrative leave now this is going to lead me to another

2065
02:59:28,820 --> 02:59:38,900
thing is that if the military has a stronger you know kill rule than the police does that's fucking

2066
02:59:38,900 --> 02:59:43,300
a problem right the fuck there wait a minute here so wait it wasn't the regular police it

2067
02:59:43,300 --> 02:59:50,100
was the military no it was i'm using as an example because we get a lot of these stories of cops just

2068
02:59:50,100 --> 02:59:54,260
shooting people and the military won't do is not allowed to do that sort of thing okay wait so

2069
02:59:54,260 --> 02:59:59,140
these people are acting on what someone else said yeah they don't have actual information they're

2070
02:59:59,140 --> 03:00:04,020
they're going well they're the guy that's on the phone is impersonating the person that's supposed

2071
03:00:04,020 --> 03:00:08,420
to be at that house so he's basically saying i have my family hostage i'm gonna shoot them

2072
03:00:09,060 --> 03:00:14,420
you know right and just so the police are going on what this guy says because they have nothing else

2073
03:00:14,420 --> 03:00:21,060
to go on correct right and on top of that yeah the guy who ended up being shot had nothing to

2074
03:00:21,060 --> 03:00:24,580
do with the dispute at all yeah and it was completely different person again i hate that

2075
03:00:24,580 --> 03:00:27,940
this is tied to video games because really the story at its core it really has nothing to do

2076
03:00:27,940 --> 03:00:32,100
with video games that's just assholes but but at the same time but at the same time you're right

2077
03:00:32,100 --> 03:00:34,500
we were talking about this a little bit when we're talking about like we were talking about

2078
03:00:34,500 --> 03:00:40,580
ingress like you know with as much as like other people in the game have annoyed me previously and

2079
03:00:40,580 --> 03:00:46,020
so forth i think we are all decent enough people to know you don't fucking do this right ever

2080
03:00:46,020 --> 03:00:51,140
absolutely because someone killed my portal that's ridiculous it's ridiculous oh i've never heard of

2081
03:00:51,140 --> 03:00:55,460
that and on top of that this bearish guy was also charged with another incident that happened in

2082
03:00:55,460 --> 03:01:01,060
canada so this guy's a serial swatter he's also called in bomb threats to evacuate what a fucker

2083
03:01:01,860 --> 03:01:07,780
okay wait a minute here hold up how old is he 25. bye that totally sounds like a like a 12 year

2084
03:01:07,780 --> 03:01:13,620
old thing to do right i didn't i wouldn't show when i was 12 i'm mad i know kids with more

2085
03:01:13,620 --> 03:01:18,180
maturity than this doing him doing something like that neither but but again you know not

2086
03:01:18,180 --> 03:01:23,940
only is the swatting a problem but it also has to do with the standards that the police are held to

2087
03:01:23,940 --> 03:01:31,140
yeah when we've got people being murdered just for raising their hand or going to grab their id

2088
03:01:31,780 --> 03:01:37,220
when the military has a stronger rule toward uh what is it the rules of engagement

2089
03:01:38,580 --> 03:01:42,980
then you've got a problem you have a fucking problem so this is a problem much bigger than

2090
03:01:42,980 --> 03:01:47,380
anything unfortunately we're going to solve on olr tonight but i think what we need to do is you know

2091
03:01:47,380 --> 03:01:53,620
the part we can do something about is continue to try to build a community that just you know treats

2092
03:01:53,620 --> 03:01:59,060
each other decently you know and if you lose a bet for a dollar 50 pay the goddamn dollar 50

2093
03:02:02,180 --> 03:02:08,180
it's not that hard i'm calling people to your house rob but what no oh oh you better pay me

2094
03:02:08,180 --> 03:02:14,020
two dollars all right dollars because i owe her two dollars all right low-key uh one more story

2095
03:02:14,020 --> 03:02:19,460
from you we're gonna get skypline here in just a moment okay so nintendo has um sued a mobile

2096
03:02:19,460 --> 03:02:26,100
developer in japan by the name of uh koappel i guess that's how you pronounce that and over a

2097
03:02:27,140 --> 03:02:32,820
patent that they have for using a touch screen as a virtual joystick so they filed the lawsuit

2098
03:02:32,820 --> 03:02:39,780
against them um i guess for a game called the white cat project um which i guess uses some sort

2099
03:02:39,780 --> 03:02:48,100
of free forming free floating uh touch screen as an approximation of a joystick that's such a vague

2100
03:02:48,180 --> 03:02:52,260
patent man i really hate companies having this kind of stuff but anyways lately at the very

2101
03:02:52,260 --> 03:02:58,900
least it's not for a ton of money they basically are seeking 39.3 million yen which is about 350

2102
03:02:58,900 --> 03:03:10,740
000 because of this alleged patent issue that's dumb that's really dumb that's another thing that

2103
03:03:10,740 --> 03:03:15,620
probably needs to be examined in this country is is a lot of the patent laws granted wait a minute

2104
03:03:16,500 --> 03:03:26,660
just try and patent like um virtual trade of items uh i don't think they bought a company

2105
03:03:26,660 --> 03:03:32,420
that does virtual cartoony things and people know it's like virtual virtual trade of items through

2106
03:03:33,460 --> 03:03:38,420
like i hadn't heard of that yes no they filed it hasn't been done yet so like if i drop you

2107
03:03:38,420 --> 03:03:44,100
a capsule of bursters like that idea of if no like if i wanted to be in japan and i wanted to

2108
03:03:44,100 --> 03:03:51,860
give you something else in the u.s there's like a virtual travel thing oh i bet that's for pokemon

2109
03:03:51,860 --> 03:03:58,980
it it is i'm sure so there's or ingress like dropping gear for stuff so they're trying to

2110
03:03:58,980 --> 03:04:06,100
patent that idea of of um like you have to use actual travel doesn't ingress doesn't need it

2111
03:04:06,100 --> 03:04:12,660
i mean you you know there was like a like they were like like traveling stuff from like like

2112
03:04:12,660 --> 03:04:16,660
train lines and stuff like that like if you wanted to drop gear for someone but they were

2113
03:04:16,660 --> 03:04:21,780
trying to patent that interesting so like i could go to a train station and drop the gear

2114
03:04:21,780 --> 03:04:25,940
to another train station although i really think like a locker i really think this is pokemon i

2115
03:04:25,940 --> 03:04:29,860
think it's nothing to do with ingress no it's totally they're trying they're trying to solve

2116
03:04:29,860 --> 03:04:36,900
the problem of how do we open up pokemon trading but make it so that you can use a patent they send

2117
03:04:36,900 --> 03:04:42,340
you a file google it like stupid yeah niantic like filed for some patent about like fucking

2133
03:06:13,540 --> 03:06:18,820
oh yes porn uh so pornhub has talked about the top consoles when it comes to browsing the site's

2134
03:06:18,820 --> 03:06:23,380
content now i'm assuming they filtered out pc which and tablets which i would think would be

2135
03:06:23,380 --> 03:06:30,580
the most obvious things to uh but what consoles do you think access the pornhub the most uh snow

2136
03:06:30,580 --> 03:06:36,420
what console do you think access is pornography the most my daughter's phone it said no phone

2137
03:06:36,420 --> 03:06:44,740
oh i'm sorry my bad one my bad all right um i would know well i say ps4 56 playstation

2138
03:06:44,740 --> 03:06:51,620
dominated the traffic 32 on the xbox because now you're buying an xbox

2139
03:06:53,620 --> 03:06:58,980
edge is built into the xbox so you can access pornhub.com on the xbox this is interesting

2140
03:06:58,980 --> 03:07:04,340
information thank you for telling me your soft edge have you tried tori but there's bing and

2141
03:07:04,340 --> 03:07:09,780
bing is great for porn searches apparently now do they have an apparently really tab on that

2142
03:07:10,420 --> 03:07:14,740
here's here's the thing that blows my mind though guys i just need to know because i've got a 13

2143
03:07:14,740 --> 03:07:21,060
year old i want a pornhub yes there's tori tori back up here tori's asking if you have to put a

2144
03:07:21,060 --> 03:07:27,380
cartridge in or like some sort of tbd yeah it's a porn card no it's online the world is yours it's

2145
03:07:27,380 --> 03:07:33,300
a porn cartridge go to the go to walmart look no don't go to the guy i need a porn cartridge y'all

2146
03:07:33,300 --> 03:07:40,260
we live in the year 2018 if it has a screen it can have porn yeah like that's in fact see that

2147
03:07:40,260 --> 03:07:44,740
and also if it has mechanical parts it'll run linux five percent or accessing porn on the

2148
03:07:44,740 --> 03:07:50,180
nintendo wii u five percent on the ps vita get this one percent on the nintendo we

2149
03:07:50,180 --> 03:07:56,180
get the fuck out can you still watch porn on the wii remember we had pterodactyl porn on the wii

2150
03:07:56,180 --> 03:08:00,580

2151
03:08:00,580 --> 03:08:07,220

2152
03:08:11,700 --> 03:08:15,700
i think that is a good last story to end on but we're going to open up the skype line right now

2176
03:10:28,340 --> 03:10:39,300
yeah uh no no as for the main potatoes of my uh call as it relates to you know services like gog

2177
03:10:39,300 --> 03:10:47,300
and steam uh are there you know i you know i would have to ask uh you and everyone else in

2178
03:10:47,300 --> 03:10:54,500
studio are there any games that you know not currently on those uh services that you would

2179
03:10:54,500 --> 03:11:03,060
love to see sold on there you know that aren't currently sold there super multitasking but i

2180
03:11:03,060 --> 03:11:09,220
think i only have to wait a month i had to throw that out there because i know he's listening uh

2181
03:11:09,780 --> 03:11:14,500
let's see games that are i mean because when i okay here's the thing though rage when i think

2182
03:11:14,500 --> 03:11:20,340
about like that question i think like oh games available on pc that are coming over from console

2183
03:11:20,340 --> 03:11:25,780
and we got some big ones tonight honestly with mario odyssey then that's when people start to

2184
03:11:25,780 --> 03:11:31,780
go crazy like oh am i crazy well i got something for you in a second here nintendo games don't come

2185
03:11:31,780 --> 03:11:36,420
out on pc except china and video shield but that's different that's a whole different thing

2186
03:11:36,420 --> 03:11:42,980
so uh yeah that's just that's just not going to happen here but um oh what was i going to say um

2187
03:11:43,700 --> 03:11:47,300
oh that's what you thought what do you want to say loogie oh i was just going to say that there's

2188
03:11:47,300 --> 03:11:55,380
um just uh today actually they announced um the team behind the 3ds emulator citra has announced

2189
03:11:55,380 --> 03:12:00,500
yuzu which is the first nintendo switch emulator that does all the things they said that you didn't

2190
03:12:00,500 --> 03:12:04,580
need it to do and one of the games that they have rain on it already the legends all the

2191
03:12:04,580 --> 03:12:08,900
breath of the wild is already playable on it wait a minute here it does the things you didn't need

2192
03:12:08,900 --> 03:12:14,980
it to do it's a joke i don't know this what they said okay you know the you know the thing is with

2193
03:12:14,980 --> 03:12:21,860
emulators you know they're kind of a gray area in the sense that technically the emulator in of

2194
03:12:21,860 --> 03:12:31,300
itself as far as you know is legal but uh i kind of like into those two uh bombs you know you know

2195
03:12:31,300 --> 03:12:38,100
at least well except for like uh california and oregon and washington where marijuana is legal

2196
03:12:38,100 --> 03:12:44,420
right no well most here's even better example rage uh emulators are kind of like a gun it's

2197
03:12:44,420 --> 03:12:49,460
not illegal to own one it's illegal to shoot somebody with it um that you you know didn't

2198
03:12:49,460 --> 03:12:55,460
have a really good reason to do so so emulators and i think i think this goes back to the whole

2199
03:12:55,460 --> 03:13:00,100
bleem in the dreamcast and uh playstation era and that whole thing like the emulator itself

2200
03:13:00,100 --> 03:13:05,460
is not illegal uh it is the games on it because the games still remain the intellectual property

2201
03:13:05,460 --> 03:13:10,980
i'm not a lawyer wait a minute here did he just say like all of the states that marijuana is legal

2202
03:13:10,980 --> 03:13:15,620
well i mean it is that's also great and emulators are also legal but not for other places yeah no

2203
03:13:18,020 --> 03:13:22,100
well what i was trying to say is like well like for new york state where i live

2204
03:13:23,060 --> 03:13:30,020
you know they you can buy a bomb but you know the thing is uh they say you know they sell

2205
03:13:30,900 --> 03:13:37,060
it's for smoking tobacco but it's kind of like wink wink you can use this for pot too you know

2206
03:13:37,060 --> 03:13:42,900
yeah and so so that's the thing with emulators emulators are supposed to be for homebrew they

2207
03:13:42,900 --> 03:13:48,660
are um engines for you know independent developers to be have a sandbox to do their own thing it's

2208
03:13:48,660 --> 03:13:53,380
not supposed to be for you to be able to play mario brothers bayway we're diverting a little

2209
03:13:53,380 --> 03:13:56,900
bit from the original question which was about like are there games that are not currently on

2210
03:13:56,900 --> 03:14:01,380
the steam service that you would like to see their gog um you know i i think you would have

2211
03:14:01,380 --> 03:14:04,660
to go to probably some of the biggest console classics right now like things like horizon i

2212
03:14:04,660 --> 03:14:07,940
think a lot of people would get a kick out of that being horizon zero dawn specifically being

2213
03:14:07,940 --> 03:14:13,540
able to play that on pc um some people i'm sure would love it if blizzard would put their games

2214
03:14:13,540 --> 03:14:18,020
out on steam but that's just not going to happen they have no reason to not whatsoever wish i mean

2215
03:14:18,020 --> 03:14:23,940
it's kind of unnecessary but it'd be cool if minecraft was on steam okay why wouldn't you

2216
03:14:23,940 --> 03:14:27,940
put a game on steam because it's owned by microsoft and microsoft has their own

2217
03:14:27,940 --> 03:14:35,460
stoner front why won't cbs just put star trek discovery on netflix because why exactly why

2218
03:14:35,460 --> 03:14:40,660
because you'll pay to go to their service to watch it but then they have to pay also for people to

2219
03:14:40,660 --> 03:14:44,900
watch it right sorta i mean but they're making money because you're paying five bucks a month

2220
03:14:44,900 --> 03:14:50,580
for cbs all access so anyway sometimes sometimes it's to lure you to a specific place anyway let

2221
03:14:50,580 --> 03:14:55,140
me ask you this real quick and i want to i want to uh get back to the um get back to the uh phones

2222
03:14:55,140 --> 03:14:59,220
here but spazzinator um or excuse me rage nator i always get confused because your name your name

2223
03:14:59,220 --> 03:15:04,660
comes up different in the um uh skype uh rage nator i know you don't really play ingress but

2224

gay uh games i don't necessarily get a chance to play um case in point you know you know

2227
03:15:28,500 --> 03:15:34,500

and take this hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is bobby blackwolf hey bobby

2240
03:16:37,380 --> 03:16:41,460
it's the guy who does the show before us here on sunday night it's always a pleasure i don't see a

2241
03:16:41,460 --> 03:16:46,580
picture that's probably for the she wants to know if you look like jack black bobby i actually do

2242
03:16:46,580 --> 03:16:52,180
look like jack black all right actually kind of like ryan reynolds i'd be happy all right anyway

2243
03:16:52,180 --> 03:16:58,420
bob no what's up bobby snow be quiet let bobby talk what's up so tonight was a very monumental

2244
03:16:59,060 --> 03:17:03,860
night uh because of the the retirement of the joke that i the inside joke i have been making

2245
03:17:03,860 --> 03:17:10,180
for years uh and it was for a good cause uh but i wanted to share my head canon of how i was going

2246
03:17:10,180 --> 03:17:14,740
to end the joke and and it's pretty clever and the joke we're talking about is the halo being

2247
03:17:14,740 --> 03:17:20,580
classic game of the week right yes because i also hate halo all right so that's why i was pushing

2248
03:17:20,580 --> 03:17:25,940
for it because i wanted i wanted to share in the misery all right i kind of never realized that but

2249
03:17:25,940 --> 03:17:32,420
why do you hate halo i don't hate it i think it's great i'm i'm terrible at first person shooters so

2250
03:17:32,420 --> 03:17:36,660
it's it's not because it's a bad game it's because i suck at the club all right let let the man talks

2251
03:17:36,660 --> 03:17:41,300
now all right so you you had your whole head cannon for how this big moment was gonna go down

2252
03:17:41,300 --> 03:17:47,140
yes so and and and jamie laughed so that's why i'm gonna share it but it would have been on a

2253
03:17:47,140 --> 03:17:52,740
night somehow like if i happen to be on the show live like in sacramento for like if i was in

2254
03:17:52,740 --> 03:17:57,060
out in the bay area for business or whatever we've talked about it it almost happened once

2255
03:17:57,060 --> 03:18:01,860
i remember yes it's almost happened a couple times uh but jamie wouldn't be there i'm like

2256
03:18:01,860 --> 03:18:07,380
oh i'll do the classic game of the week and don't worry jamie i will not pick halo and she would

2257
03:18:07,380 --> 03:18:12,260
believe me which she actually wouldn't but in my head cannon she did okay so that's where the

2258
03:18:12,260 --> 03:18:19,860
fiction is uh and i would have said okay tonight's classic game of the week is dead or alive 4 and

2259
03:18:19,940 --> 03:18:23,780
we'd start playing the music from dead or alive 4 and i talk about you know 30 seconds about

2260
03:18:23,780 --> 03:18:29,780
dead or life 4 and bring up one of the characters was spartan 117 and immediately the music would

2261
03:18:29,780 --> 03:18:34,420
change to halo and i would sit there for five minutes talking about the background of this

2262
03:18:34,420 --> 03:18:40,740
character in dead or alive 4 uh talking all about the halo series and what it's all about and then

2263
03:18:40,740 --> 03:18:44,820
at the end it would go back to do a form of music and i'd be like yep dead or alive 4 classic game

2264
03:18:44,820 --> 03:18:48,900
of the week and that would be the end of the second i think it's pretty clever using a character

2265
03:18:48,900 --> 03:18:55,140
in the game to inject uh the real topic at hand now it just tempts me that for classic games in

2266
03:18:55,140 --> 03:19:00,500
the future i'm going to be like okay how do we six degrees of halo this game that's right it's the

2267
03:19:00,500 --> 03:19:05,780
new kevin bacon it was on this console yeah halo was on this console by the way did you know that

2268
03:19:05,780 --> 03:19:13,700
this one particular artist went on to uh go make a game called halo exactly rob do they have a

2269
03:19:13,700 --> 03:19:19,300
website like that that'll that'll connect six degrees of video games rob yes i will alert the

2270
03:19:19,300 --> 03:19:26,180
world that mr smoosh is your next of kin that's okay if he is so cute if alan and i were to die

2271
03:19:26,180 --> 03:19:30,180
in a fiery car crash heaven forbid and we go we don't have kids or anything like that so i mr

2272
03:19:30,180 --> 03:19:38,340

2273
03:19:38,340 --> 03:19:46,420
adopted i'm just teasing they're all really good at video games just saying oh that's good no

2274
03:19:46,420 --> 03:19:50,020
we could we could uh we could build on that a little bit i will i can have whichever one isn't

2275
03:19:50,020 --> 03:19:54,900
irritating me that day i lost my train of thought so never mind that's okay that's okay bobby was

2276
03:19:54,900 --> 03:19:58,900
uh well now you're just gonna have to come up so now now what do we do bobby you need a new joke

2277
03:19:58,900 --> 03:20:04,180
do we i don't know we'll have to figure it out somehow i know you know what like most i have

2278
03:20:04,180 --> 03:20:09,620
to pick something else i'll never pick like most jokes on this show such as loki dressing up as

2279
03:20:09,620 --> 03:20:16,500
tingle i judgment i mean i did do miss nude world as well you know as these these long-running oil

oranges it will just be grown organically we'll figure it out eventually i need another game i

2281
03:20:21,620 --> 03:20:27,380
loathe maybe bobby can talk about um next year he'll fill up the time capsule with things that

2282
03:20:27,380 --> 03:20:34,260
make sense okay you should write down what it is you put in there before you actually

2283
03:20:34,260 --> 03:20:40,180
seal it i listened to that and i was like how did you guys not know i tried there like two months

2285
03:20:45,540 --> 03:20:52,020

this is the part though where i'm gonna ask uh if there was any um last minute stories

2304
03:22:25,300 --> 03:22:30,580
no i already read my last minute story what was that it's about the emulator for the switch

2305
03:22:31,780 --> 03:22:35,460
which i'm very excited about yeah because then i might actually get to play mario honestly

2306
03:22:35,460 --> 03:22:40,180
i i can't imagine that thing runs very well or it's gonna need like a heck of a computer to run

2307
03:22:40,180 --> 03:22:46,900
it why they run the we use stuff runs at 4k at 60 fps all right i guess i would assume that

2308
03:22:46,980 --> 03:22:51,140
to be fair i honestly honest to god haven't used an emulator on a pc

2309
03:22:52,260 --> 03:22:58,980
i mean the main cabinet is one thing but that's really it like i just i don't really play

2310
03:22:58,980 --> 03:23:06,980
emulators like i can run uh weu games at 1080p at full speed and they look nice so all right uh

2335
03:25:27,780 --> 03:25:33,220
my phone really no that's because you have five thousand other apps to play one game

2336
03:25:34,180 --> 03:25:39,300
that is a fact it is it's like a free puppy ingress is like a free puppy it's like anytime

2337
03:25:39,300 --> 03:25:42,500
i go visit another town because i am fortunate enough that you know my travels have taken me

2338
03:25:42,500 --> 03:25:46,420
different places it's like i go to this city and they're like oh we use group me i go to this city

2340
03:25:52,660 --> 03:25:59,220
only thing it has what is it group me in one area panda says rock cat went to bed and then is that

2341
03:25:59,300 --> 03:26:03,860

2344
03:26:14,980 --> 03:26:18,740
it for five minutes it's not lighting up i think i think folks are going to bed so i think we're

2345
03:26:18,740 --> 03:26:22,020
going to wrap up here at orange launch radio a nice long show for the night here but i promised

2346
03:26:22,020 --> 03:26:25,940
one for the history books so there it is we're gonna wrap up here at orange launch radio tonight

2347
03:26:25,940 --> 03:26:29,540
and i want to thank you guys very much for listening i want to thank our guests for being

2348
03:26:29,540 --> 03:26:34,100
here it was such a fun show and even i think again like we were kind of asking uh rage nader

2349
03:26:34,100 --> 03:26:38,100
when he called it even for the folks that don't play the game i think they just like hearing the

2350
03:26:38,100 --> 03:26:42,820
stories and uh yeah it's great and i've always been i didn't really get into this at all but

2351
03:26:43,380 --> 03:26:47,460
one thing that always kind of made me like really like like happy about ingress and i thought was

2352
03:26:47,460 --> 03:26:52,100
really cool especially compared to a lot of other games i played is that like the people that are

2353
03:26:52,100 --> 03:26:57,220
running a lot of the shit especially in like in this town on our on our side are women and like

2354
03:26:57,220 --> 03:27:01,700
there's a lot of like strong women playing this game and i think when we have a lot of talks

2355
03:27:01,700 --> 03:27:05,460
in the gaming community especially you know because there's the overwatch league is going

2356
03:27:05,460 --> 03:27:09,860
through this right now about like out of 133 players in the league how do you not have one

2357
03:27:09,860 --> 03:27:14,740
woman you know and that's a whole nother topic for another show no globally globally in ingress

2358
03:27:14,740 --> 03:27:19,060
the majority of people who play are women and there's there's great men too of course but i

2359
03:27:19,060 --> 03:27:25,140
mean like you really see that the like equalness for sure if not a lot of the a lot of the people

2360
03:27:25,140 --> 03:27:29,700
that are running at least on our side a lot of people that are running the stuff for anomalies

2361
03:27:29,700 --> 03:27:34,660
or fielding all that it's ladies i'd say that like even on the other side of global leaders

2362
03:27:34,660 --> 03:27:39,060
are women yeah is run by a woman yeah so it's yeah it's not just even our team so yeah i think it's

2363
03:27:39,060 --> 03:27:45,380
great so uh yeah and um i just i just love that and i'm happy to support that and all that good

2364
03:27:45,380 --> 03:27:49,380
stuff so uh and i'm sure the listeners really loved hearing from you guys um of the stories

2365
03:27:49,380 --> 03:27:53,540
and all that good stuff so thank you guys all for being here we usually do a little part of the show

2366
03:27:53,540 --> 03:27:58,740

2368
03:28:01,540 --> 03:28:08,660

2369
03:28:08,660 --> 03:28:14,260

2370
03:28:14,260 --> 03:28:18,580

2428
03:33:13,220 --> 03:33:17,140
and the people i've met over there too to kind of tie the two bridges together just like you know

2429
03:33:17,140 --> 03:33:22,340
just the generosity of of awesome gamers and that's what we need to just hear more about and

2432
03:33:34,660 --> 03:33:37,860
moment since i don't really have much of a final thought there was someone that posted a thing on

2433
03:33:37,860 --> 03:33:43,140
reddit they showed that their significant other um that she got stardew valley and so going down

2434
03:33:43,140 --> 03:33:47,860
the comments there so just tell her to stay away from shane such a dick i told her to tell

2435
03:33:47,860 --> 03:33:54,500
shane the fuck off well i already said earlier shane's the worst no seriously shane's awesome

2436
03:33:54,500 --> 03:33:58,740
but it is silly the next time you guys are here i'm going to invite him too and it'll be an

2437
03:33:58,740 --> 03:34:02,180
intervention you need to play ingress again night because i would that would be great for me i'd
