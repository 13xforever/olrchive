7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Labo, Labo, Labo! Nintendo's foray into makerspace may be giving birth to the next generation of makers, or it may just be more narrow use accessories that don't survive a generation of gaming. Only time will tell, but in the meantime we've got more of this week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	52000	Hello my friends, and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight. Episode number 715 for this, January 21st, 2018. My name is Rob Roberts on the Twitters at Skie, S-K-I-E, my old school DDR freak name, and that'll be relevant here in a minute.
52000	60000	And over there next to me is, she always is, as she's always been on DDR freak and ever since, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
60000	70000	I remember DDR freak and special things that happened around it. I remember being a moderator and just shaking my head at some of the shenanigans.
70000	74000	I remember getting the little flashy foot towards the end of the run, that was exciting.
74000	77000	I remember controversial bannings that I did.
78000	81000	You laying the band hammer down on someone?
81000	82000	Yeah.
82000	87000	Alright, we are going to have a little bit of an old school night tonight, and I'll get into that in a moment, but sadly not here tonight.
87000	92000	Tech master Loki, he has family commitments today, so he will not be joining us, but he'll be back next week.
92000	98000	Big welcome to those of you that are joining us live, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network.
99000	102000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
102000	110000	By the way, Bobby Black Wolf hitting 600 episodes tonight, so big congrats to Bobby Black Wolf on his landmark 600th episode.
110000	113000	I know he didn't do anything too special to celebrate.
113000	117000	As we kind of hit a point ourselves, we were like, woo, another 100 mark, woo.
117000	121000	But still, still, very, very, very few podcasters in that club.
121000	124000	I'm still a little disappointed we didn't have our big quinceañera.
124000	127000	Well, never say never. Might just be a little late.
128000	133000	You know, my pal Aria Snark, who you're going to hear more about a little later, just saying.
133000	142000	Aria Snark, she had a quinceañera for her 30th, so they did like a double quinceañera to catch her up, because she never had one originally.
142000	143000	So never say never.
143000	144000	I never had one.
144000	145000	We just didn't make it to 30 years ago.
145000	147000	But they weren't a thing where I'm from.
147000	153000	So here we are, it's just the two, isn't this weird, because last week we had so many people here in studio,
153000	158000	and then this week it's just you and me, feeling the love with our chatters at live.vognetwork.com.
158000	163000	And hello to anybody that is checking out OLR thanks to last week's show.
163000	168000	My understanding is that that show got passed around amongst the various Ingress communities.
168000	173000	Not just the opposition here figured out about it and was listening a little bit, so hey guys.
173000	180000	And I guess it got out, some folks on the East Coast were like, oh yeah, Snow told me about the show, I checked it out.
180000	182000	So thanks you guys, and that's awesome.
182000	183000	We hope that you're still listening.
183000	184000	Yeah, that would be awesome.
184000	188000	Sadly, I don't have a lot of Ingress tonight, because I haven't played as much.
188000	195000	I bumped both of your portals over there, but you've got one that's gone white, so I didn't have time to do anything to it.
195000	198000	I've had a lot of other stuff going on, which will make sense here shortly.
198000	200000	My nemesis has been trying to take my neighborhood.
200000	202000	Well, psh, psh, psh.
202000	204000	Give me some posters, please.
204000	206000	I didn't think we were going to talk about Ingress tonight, but here we are.
206000	207000	See, there you go.
207000	211000	Now, there you go, your five seconds of Ingress talk.
211000	213000	Just to keep that crowd here tonight.
213000	214000	Yeah.
214000	215000	But we do talk about-
215000	216000	Rob needs to give me bursters.
216000	217000	That's the story.
217000	219000	Well, I don't know if I have.
219000	220000	Well, I think I have a few.
220000	221000	We'll probably give some away.
221000	225000	I need some that aren't, you know, level six, like what I have now.
225000	233000	Anyway, what we do talk about here at Orange Lawn Triadio are all different types of video games, be it console, PC, you know, pretty much everything.
233000	237000	But this show started many years ago, over 15 years ago.
237000	247000	Dark Sakura, myself, and Loki, who's not here, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution and other games that were in Konami's B-Moni series or Beatmania.
247000	256000	Or basically, they're a series dedicated to hit the note, or hit the button to play the note in time with the music, would be, I guess, the most simple way I could describe it.
256000	259000	We're going to talk a little more about that tonight, actually.
259000	260000	We're going to do a little bit of a throwback.
260000	267000	So whereas last week was all about a modern cell phone game, tonight we're going to talk a little bit later here at the top of the show in about 20 minutes or so.
267000	270000	We're going to talk with an old friend of the show.
270000	271000	This is a big throwback.
271000	274000	I think he was on like our sixth episode of the show, and then a few episodes after that.
274000	276000	We're up to 715 now.
276000	285000	But our pal Mel B is going to join us tonight over Skype to talk about an upcoming freestyle DDR tournament that's happening in the Bay Area this next weekend.
285000	289000	And even if you can't be there in person, you're going to be able to check it.
289000	294000	Thanks to the technology and how far it's come in 15 years, you're going to be able to check it out all over the world.
294000	297000	So we'll talk to Mel about DDR and freestyle and where that's all at.
297000	299000	So it's a little blast of the past.
299000	301000	I wish I still played DDR regularly.
301000	305000	I'd probably be about 20 pounds lighter, but here we are.
306000	315000	You think Pokemon Go and all the walking I do with that might have helped with the old weight, the beer gut, even though I don't really drink beer.
315000	317000	I can't really talk about that.
317000	323000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
323000	327000	Let's see, actdeft in chat, starting us off tonight talking about Dark Soccer's ban hammer.
327000	329000	Fear Dark Soccer's ban hammer.
329000	331000	It is tough, but fair.
332000	335000	Dark Tetsuya talking about the DDR scene.
335000	337000	The Wednesday nights at RVGL, good fucking times.
337000	339000	I started playing again this year.
339000	342000	I did a weekly thing in 2012, but figured I'd start up again.
342000	344000	You know what? It's a good habit to have.
344000	345000	It's a very good habit to have.
345000	350000	My pal JD, who you've heard on this show many times and you see in chat once in a while,
350000	357000	he's also very good at trying to get me to play DDR when he's visiting or I'm visiting there because he still plays pretty regularly.
357000	365000	As I understand it, there was a pretty big Perfect Attack tournament that happened this last weekend at G5.
365000	368000	We'll hear more about that later, so we'll wait for that.
368000	372000	In the meantime though, before we get to that, let's start off our show with a kickoff topic
372000	378000	and some really big Nintendo news this week that could be about the future of gaming?
378000	381000	Dark Soccer, tell us a little bit about Labo.
381000	386000	Well, I watched the commercial for it and I was like, the fuck is this?
386000	389000	And then I was like, this is pretty cool.
389000	396000	I mean, it's all cardboard, but the fact that you get these kits and basically they're paper craft.
396000	398000	In a nutshell, they're paper craft.
398000	402000	Putting them together, I think, is probably the most fun of it.
402000	411000	But then it's used, I guess in conjunction, there's places to put in the controller, the Joy-Con and everything on the Switch,
411000	418000	and even places to put the screen so that each of these little kits gives you a different experience.
418000	423000	I wonder though, I didn't see if they come with a game to use that peripheral with?
423000	425000	Or like a tool?
425000	427000	They didn't really explain the games.
427000	430000	You can see that the screens are running some sort of game, at least some of them.
430000	434000	It looked like that little robot that crawled around on the ground.
434000	436000	The screen was the controls, basically.
436000	439000	You were controlling the controllers with your controller.
439000	444000	And there seemed to be some sort of pseudo-VR going on.
444000	446000	Very pseudo-VR.
446000	448000	Pseudo-pseudo, yeah.
448000	450000	Pseudo-wudo, actually, since this is Nintendo.
450000	452000	But anyway.
452000	454000	That's Hal, Rob.
454000	456000	Here's one of the games that was there.
456000	465000	Do you remember a couple years ago at E3, Miyamoto was presenting his demos that justify why the Wii U has a gamepad.
465000	467000	That's kind of what it was.
467000	473000	And one of those demos ended up being the Star Fox spin-off tactical game they had that came with the Star Fox.
473000	477000	But then the other was that robot that punched things. That was there.
477000	481000	It's probably not the same thing that you guys saw at E3 that year, but it's been repurposed.
481000	485000	But all ideas spawn new ideas.
485000	491000	Honestly, I'd like to think that it's a very original concept.
491000	496000	It's something new, and I think people look at anything new with skepticism.
496000	504000	However, I think Nintendo's got a track record of taking what we're skeptical about and making it a success.
504000	506000	Well, usually.
506000	508000	That's why I said there's a record.
508000	513000	Okay, because I was going to say, Virtual Boy, Wii U, not always.
513000	516000	Honestly enough, I liked the Wii U a lot better than I thought I would.
516000	519000	But sales-wise, it just didn't happen.
519000	521000	Because people are stupid.
521000	523000	Namely third parties.
523000	527000	But the Wii U is what spawned the Switch. I truly believe that.
527000	534000	Oh, sure. I think the Switch is kind of what the Wii U was supposed to be, but the technology kind of just wasn't there.
534000	536000	It just wasn't there yet.
536000	538000	I think it was there to sort of wet the palate.
538000	540000	Yeah.
540000	547000	And so, I look at the Wii U as the evolution phase.
547000	556000	When you look at the human evolution, it's like the one with the weird shape and head that eventually becomes what grows into humanity.
556000	558000	Excuse me.
558000	560000	Oh, you alright over there?
560000	562000	Yeah, no.
562000	566000	The joys of doing live. Sometimes there's coughs and burps and things that happen.
566000	567000	Well, no.
567000	568000	We're human.
568000	573000	I think part of the side effect of my surgery is a lot of burping. Sorry. Sorry about it. Not sorry.
573000	575000	It's gonna happen.
575000	578000	But I really do...
578000	583000	There are people who I think are looking at this as, oh, this is just for kids.
583000	586000	But you gotta think about it.
586000	595000	I think that the adult who has lost their childlike imagination may as well be somewhat dead inside.
595000	607000	I seriously believe that. You've got those people out there who are only worried about their business or just mundane things.
607000	616000	And I think that the moment that you lose that spark of imagination that you had as a child, it's a little death to me.
616000	625000	And so I was excited by this because there's a lot of imagination, a lot of passion that's gone into an idea like this.
625000	627000	And I really want to see it work.
627000	632000	You know, Nintendo did come out in the beginning and say, what we're about to announce is for kids and for the kid inside you.
632000	639000	So, you know, you kind of had to if you were thinking, oh, it's going to be this the smash announcement today, like you are just you're on crack.
639000	643000	If you thought that's where it was going, like they warned you it was going to be something a little different.
643000	650000	And I honestly was kind of like, honest to God, my mind was like, maybe they're going to do like a Sesame Street channel.
650000	652000	Like, you know, we had no idea what was coming.
652000	656000	So I was like, oh, maybe there'll be like a Sesame Street channel coming on Nintendo Switch.
656000	663000	And, you know, the kid in all of us can go watch the episodes of the 70s or like or watch that hella awesome Pointer Sisters.
663000	666000	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
666000	670000	Anyway, see, who doesn't remember that? That's our age anyway.
670000	672000	That's our age. I'm glad you added that.
673000	681000	If you're if you're younger and you have no idea what we're referencing, you owe it to yourself to go to YouTube and like Pointer Sisters 12.
681000	682000	I'm sure would come up with it.
682000	683000	Was it on Sesame Street?
683000	685000	Yeah, it was on Sesame Street at one point. Yeah.
685000	686000	You know.
688000	689000	Great. Now I'm just feeling.
689000	691000	It's all right. I was going to finish my thought anyway.
691000	692000	Yeah, please do.
692000	694000	So this whole thing kind of came out of left field.
694000	696000	I don't think anybody could have predicted this.
696000	700000	We had no leaks that were really pushing that direction or anything.
700000	703000	So, you know, this this was a very hard thing to call.
705000	707000	I watched the trailer and I was kind of pleasantly surprised.
707000	711000	I mean, certainly I had that reaction of like, it's cardboard.
711000	713000	Nintendo is going to sell you cardboard.
713000	718000	And of course, I wrote all the sassy tweets to go along with that in my cheap ploy for retweets.
718000	727000	But at the end of the day, I was like, you know, but if any company is going to make cardboard cool, like it's going to be Nintendo.
727000	734000	And yes, I realize like the fishing pole has like some cheap string and some like washer plastic washer looking things.
734000	736000	So it's not 100 percent cardboard.
736000	739000	But let's be real. Those kits are not going to be that expensive to make.
739000	753000	And Nintendo stands to make a big profit with it, which honestly is my only hesitation with this is that everything we saw in that little commercial is going to cost one hundred and thirty dollars because it's sixty dollars for one pack.
753000	762000	Seventy dollars for the robot pack, which is probably I'm going to guess being as it was the Miyamoto demo is going to be the more fully featured game, which is why it's a little more expensive.
762000	768000	But I'm just like, I think at that price point, though, it's going to have to come with some software.
768000	771000	It does come with software, but they're like, they're there.
771000	773000	Well, we don't know what the robot thing is, really.
773000	778000	But as far as like the piano and the it's kind of tech demo, you know, one is neat, though it's neat.
778000	782000	But is it something you're going to enjoy for very long after you build it?
782000	785000	And I'm just I need less shit in this house.
785000	787000	You've seen my garage.
787000	792000	You know, the shelf of Bimani, you know, peripherals I have.
792000	800000	And so on my leftover Genesis and SNES era peripherals, you've seen the stack.
800000	810000	And I keep thinking the advantage of something like this is that once it's assembled, it could be disassembled and stored.
810000	821000	You know, you know, for me, if I got something like this, I'd probably end up laminating the aura, treating the cardboard.
821000	827000	If you could, it might throw it off, especially I'm thinking that little robot where the controllers move it.
827000	834000	If you make that cardboard too heavy with the weight and even maybe using like epoxy or resin, I'm just saying using like a sealant.
834000	842000	Or, you know, like what I do, you can and here's cosplay tip number twenty one from Jamie.
842000	846000	A little DIY stuff. You can get mod podge.
846000	850000	It's you use it for decoupage and for doing paper crafts.
850000	858000	But mod podge is also a sealant for paper and cardboard and you use it for sealing up a decoupage.
858000	859000	You know, decoupage is right?
859000	860000	Yeah.
860000	864000	Well, for those who don't know, decoupage is taking like cutouts and pieces of paper.
864000	865000	It's like a scrapbook.
865000	866000	Kind of.
866000	871000	But you do it either in patterns or different things or for collage and then you seal it over with the mod podge.
871000	874000	That's why you got the Polaroid camera recently, right? Was to do stuff like that.
874000	882000	No, I got the Polaroid camera because one of my friends who will, hopefully I can have him on the show before he goes back to Australia,
882000	888000	is my friend JJ, who sometimes shows up in chat, who's going to be down here for DragCon.
888000	890000	We're going to DragCon together.
890000	891000	Fine.
891000	899000	But I started looking at his forays into Polaroids and I was already into Holga photography.
899000	903000	And so I picked up a Polaroid Spectra for 20 bucks.
903000	906000	I picked up a pack of film for 20 bucks.
906000	909000	Sorry, just to go back to the Labo thing for a little bit.
909000	915000	I do think it's going to be very interesting to see all the people that are going to be like, here's how I blinged out my robot.
915000	918000	Or here's, you know, it is going to inspire that level of creativity.
918000	920000	You saw how they were painting them and everything.
920000	924000	So clearly it can take a layer of something on it.
924000	927000	Can't I, I mean, Jamie, can't I look at something in the gaming industry?
927000	930000	And I don't think we do this enough as gaming fans.
930000	933000	You know, a lot of what we see on Twitter is cynicism and social media and stuff like that.
933000	938000	Can't I, as a gaming fan, look at Nintendo Labo and go, that is really awesome.
938000	941000	I'm probably not going to buy it, but that's awesome for like the kids.
941000	946000	Like if I had kids and I wanted to get them interesting in engineering.
946000	950000	And the really cool thing about something like Labo and especially the day and age that we live in.
950000	958000	Like that's something that like girls and boys and no matter gender, no matter ethnicity or any of that stuff.
958000	964000	You could like be super into that and express your like creative senses through something like Labo.
964000	966000	Which was basically Legos to us back in the day.
966000	973000	Remember Lego had that really cool statement in the seventies about something like it doesn't, man, they wrote, remember they wrote that letter.
973000	977000	And it was like a letter to a girl or something. It was like, it doesn't matter who you are.
977000	979000	Yeah. Lego had like a really awesome letter in the seventies.
979000	990000	And I, um, I think though it's only going to be a matter of time that people are going to buy the Labo, you know, and then recreate and put the patterns online, you know.
990000	997000	But I think that what's going to, I honestly think that the price point is going to be coming from software that's packaged in with it.
997000	998000	Oh sure.
998000	1006000	And the fact that there's probably going to be other pieces of software virtually that are going to make use of the Labo peripherals.
1006000	1014000	It could be very interesting to see what happens with Labo in the future. Like, you know, I think about this, you know, I say this a little bit tongue in cheek, but not really.
1014000	1022000	Like I think about, okay, so we just recently had the Super Mario cereal that came out, right? And the Super Mario cereal had the amiibo chip inside the box.
1022000	1026000	So people were trying to find those boxes like crazy to get the, the cereal amiibo basically, right?
1026000	1037000	Well, um, why couldn't maybe Super Mario cereal next time be a Labo? The cardboard could actually become a Labo and you could download a silly little thing.
1037000	1043000	It doesn't have to be complex. You don't have to package it in with like a piano or some shit, but you know, something kind of simple, silly.
1043000	1050000	I was actually kind of surprised. I think that if there was going to be one, you'd get the piano one would be it.
1050000	1057000	But now look at this. What if Labo support got third party support and we start seeing...
1057000	1058000	And they say it might.
1058000	1068000	And say that, I'm just going to use this as a what if, you know, a wish. A wish. It may not even happen. It's unrealistic.
1068000	1082000	But say that they get licensing from Konami and then do a Labo, say five key beat mania or let you use the piano peripheral for a light version of keyboard mania.
1082000	1086000	You know, wouldn't something like that really pique your interest?
1086000	1094000	Actually, yes. If the piano thing was like a music based game where the music was really like interesting, like I would really be into that.
1094000	1099000	And I would actually say, though, out of all of the things they showed, that piano interested me the most.
1099000	1106000	And the technology inside it is pretty badass. Like I have to say. Like the way the infrared sensor reads like the thing on the...
1106000	1109000	That's fucking science, but like simple science.
1109000	1113000	Well, and on top of that, some of this Labo stuff makes me think of those.
1113000	1120000	You know, if you go into a hobby shop, which Dan and I were spending a lot of times at hobby shops, you know, about a year ago when he was really into RC cars.
1120000	1125000	But you go into those hobby shops and you see these build your own spider or build your own...
1125000	1129000	You know, they sell circuit boards and people are building their own, you know, little...
1129000	1133000	That's kind of like the precursor into that level of engineering.
1133000	1139000	You know, you take the teenage kits and you've made it more accessible for say people.
1139000	1152000	I'd say like maybe between six and ten, you know, that's going to be the thing that leads up into, you know, going into junior engineering and then having that interest in...
1152000	1157000	Or even like for me as an artist, just looking at how I love paper craft.
1157000	1165000	And I love things like that, that you take one single sheet and you make it into something amazing.
1165000	1171000	You're right. And those types of things that you do, like as a kid, can totally set you on a path later in life.
1171000	1177000	It might not, but it might. And I think about, you know, again, I'm going to date myself, but I thought these things were so rad.
1177000	1187000	Who remembers back in the day, Radio Shack used to sell like those kits where you'd have those little springs and you could connect wires between the springs and you learn about electricity.
1187000	1195000	And it was usually like a 20 in one kit where you could build like a little light, you could build, you know, a little a simple little switch, things like that.
1195000	1201000	One of the kits would let you build a simple radio transmitter so you could actually like broadcast.
1201000	1206000	And it was it was so low that like it wouldn't work very far outside your house. Like you weren't gonna be able to pirate radio with it.
1206000	1213000	But like and I was blown away by the fact that like I could do something in my room and my mom could hear it in her bedroom.
1213000	1216000	And look where we are now.
1216000	1225000	Well, I just remember, you know, getting like the the big nine volt batteries. Is that what they were? They were nine volt?
1225000	1232000	Yeah. And making electromagnets and then ruining our floppy disks.
1232000	1239000	And then not to get too nostalgic here, but I'll kind of end on this note. I think about, you know, you and I grew up on Mr. Wizard's World.
1239000	1246000	And like a lot of the stuff in that show was stuff around the house that Mr. Wizard would turn into the science experiments.
1246000	1251000	I don't know if he ever did Diet Coke and Mentos, but I'm sure he did something similar. I did volcanoes and stuff.
1251000	1258000	I did the Mobius one that he did, you know, where you take the paper, give it a half twist and tape it in a loop.
1258000	1262000	And when you cut it, it'll either make loops or it'll do one.
1262000	1266000	It's a Mobius is the only one truly one sided object.
1266000	1277000	You know, it's just things like that. You know, it's it's why I go back to say that you can't ever, ever lose that spark of wonder and imagination.
1277000	1283000	Because then it's when, you know, it's a little it's a little death. It's the death of the child in you.
1283000	1288000	You can't ever lose that. And that's why I really appreciate this project.
1288000	1295000	So let me ask, end with this question, ask this question, and then we're going to do a quick announcement that we're going to get to our interview tonight.
1295000	1302000	Where do you stand with Labo? Are you going to pick it up? Or Labo? I can only say Labo like it's Cabo, Wabo, Labo, but it's Labo.
1302000	1306000	Do we have an official pronunciation? I think Labo makes sense because Nintendo Labo.
1306000	1309000	That's if you're making it all American. But if it's Japanese, it would be Labo.
1309000	1314000	Oh, OK. OK. Well, anyway, what's your stance on it? You're going to buy it?
1314000	1320000	I want to wait to see all the kits and I'll make my decision if there's a kid I like, but chances are leading in.
1320000	1325000	We know we have these two. We have two kits to start. They'll probably be more. The piano one really interests me.
1325000	1332000	Yeah. So I don't know if I will jump in day one. However, I plan to tell my friends with kids about it.
1332000	1337000	Yeah, I think that's kind of where I'm at. I know that Julian already wants a switch.
1337000	1344000	I don't think he wants to buy him a switch. But this oh, man, Julian, Julian, this is right up his alley, right up his alley.
1344000	1348000	Like almost like if I were to buy it, it would be so like Julian could come over and play it.
1348000	1353000	Yeah, I would actually just say, you know, buy the kit and bring him over to play.
1353000	1358000	Yeah, right. The only thing he wants to play right now is Breath of the Wild, which is also cool.
1358000	1362000	It's like there's nothing else to play. They bring him over. All right.
1362000	1366000	I'm going to do a little bit of housekeeping here with a very special announcement here and then we're going to give our pal Mel B a call.
1366000	1375000	So I don't know if Twitter beat me to it, but I'm going to be announcing today a brand new show is joining the Voice of Geeks Network, VOG Network.
1375000	1381000	And this is another in-house production. For those of you that remember Poke Stop podcast, rest in peace.
1381000	1385000	This is an in-house production, but it actually does not have to do with games.
1385000	1393000	This is a new production between myself and my pal who is a cosplay artist. Her name is Aria Snark, but you can call her Victoria.
1393000	1399000	That is what most people know her as. And the new podcast is called Shaking and Crying.
1399000	1408000	And episode number one is available right now over at vognetwork.com and soon to be shakingandcrying.com as soon as I get the pointer to point over to the right place.
1408000	1414000	This show is going to be all about basically geek culture, pop culture, and the hosts sassing each other.
1414000	1421000	That is what the show is all about. In episode one, you're going to be able to hear us talk about the latest that's going on over the YouTube controversy.
1421000	1427000	We're going to talk a little bit about the trend for reboots in Hollywood because apparently they're going to reboot Lost, which is like what?
1427000	1432000	Didn't they already tell us how that ends? And we'll talk about Facebook Live as well.
1432000	1439000	So there's lots of stuff on the show. And for those of you listening live tonight, you can get a special sneak preview right after OLR tonight.
1439000	1443000	We're going to play episode one for you in its entirety right after Orange Laundry tonight.
1443000	1447000	But I'm really excited about it. It's been a while since I had more than one podcast.
1447000	1454000	And let's see, reading is fundamental is coming back. And then I have about two more on the radar, don't I DarkSakura?
1454000	1456000	So I'm back to podcasting full time.
1456000	1467000	Well, thankfully, one of them is going to be just a tiny little quickie. It'll be like, you know, do it and have a smoke.
1467000	1470000	You know why?
1470000	1471000	Why?
1471000	1472000	Because it's us.
1473000	1481000	All right. Let's let's see if we can get over to our pal Mel B. I'm going to give him a call here on the Twitters and I see on the Twitters on the Skype.
1481000	1484000	And I see he's listening right now. So hopefully he's anticipating this.
1484000	1491000	We're going to talk to him all about the DDR freestyle takeover, which is coming up this Saturday in San Jose.
1491000	1494000	I think we have Mel on the line. Hey, Mel, you there?
1494000	1496000	If you can hear me, you absolutely do.
1496000	1499000	We can absolutely hear you. How are you, my friend?
1499000	1502000	It has been far too long since we've had you on OLR.
1502000	1506000	Oh, gosh. Yeah, since. Yeah, you're right. I think it was the six hundredth episode.
1506000	1516000	I think you actually I think I had a very brief like chime in when you called the misses about someone having a question about purchasing an arcade game.
1516000	1519000	Oh, God, that's right. That was the last time we talked to you.
1519000	1523000	I think the last time you were physically on this show was when Shermy was alive.
1523000	1528000	Yeah, I think you haven't physically been here in a while, but you were here for episode six.
1528000	1532000	And how about that, Mel? Did you think we'd make it this long?
1532000	1536000	I didn't even think like twenty eighteen would be a possibility.
1536000	1539000	Like, just in my mind, I thought the world was just going to be dead by now.
1539000	1543000	You know, that's true. Y2K did scare the hell out of all of us back.
1543000	1547000	Oh, wait a minute. This would have been after Y2K. Damn it. Bad joke. All right.
1547000	1555000	But I know something that came out before Y2K that we got into the birth of this show was Dance Dance Revolution.
1555000	1559000	And this was a game that you played a lot of back in the day, right?
1559000	1567000	Oh, yeah. Actually, a couple of months ago, I celebrated like 18 years of playing that game.
1567000	1568000	Wow.
1568000	1574000	Yeah, because I played in October of ninety nine. First time was in Vegas out of Gameworks.
1574000	1584000	You know, Mel, I've never told you this, but the first time I had even heard of you was checking the top scores in DDR on the online board.
1585000	1587000	You mean like for DDR USA?
1587000	1591000	Yeah. And I remembered how you put your name in there.
1591000	1595000	Oh, wow. I didn't even know I was like ranked that high for a hot minute.
1595000	1597000	You were on there. I was like...
1597000	1599000	It was probably on doubles, I bet.
1599000	1600000	Yeah, but...
1600000	1604000	Did he put his initials in as Mel B? And I'm like, I love the Spice Girls.
1604000	1609000	No, it was... I'll go ahead and say it if you don't mind.
1609000	1612000	It was Mel penis cock land.
1612000	1617000	Wait, wait a second. Did I put it that way?
1617000	1618000	Yes.
1618000	1619000	That's impossible.
1619000	1622000	You must have him confused with a much nastier Mel.
1622000	1630000	No, I went back and checked and it had changed. But I remembered because I think I asked and someone said it was you.
1630000	1632000	And it was pretty high up there.
1632000	1638000	But that... I never have told you this, but that was my first...
1638000	1640000	Somebody's impersonating him. All right.
1640000	1643000	It was a pretty good score, though. I wouldn't doubt if it was you.
1643000	1646000	Those damn Russians, they were just using me as a test case.
1646000	1652000	Fake news. All right, look. So look, 18 years ago you first got into DDR.
1652000	1656000	Here we are all these years later and you're still playing it, right?
1656000	1660000	I heard you did a perfect attack thing this weekend, as did a lot of people.
1660000	1667000	There was a pretty good turnout at G5 yesterday. So they had a score attack tournament.
1668000	1674000	What's kind of interesting about this was, A, it was on an Extreme machine, but it wasn't just any old Extreme machine.
1674000	1676000	Have you heard about Extreme Pro?
1676000	1678000	No, I have not.
1678000	1685000	So, get this. Very recently there was some sort of, I guess, pack for lack of a better term.
1685000	1694000	Someone had re-engineered it so that when you play a standard game, it already defaults to a Marvelous timing.
1694000	1700000	So you know how in Extreme you can only get the Marvelous versus perfect in the Oni or the non-stop modes?
1700000	1701000	Right.
1701000	1713000	So now you can do this in a regular play because of the more recent versions of DDR, they use that sort of EX system as the standard grading for score attack.
1713000	1716000	And so now for tournament purposes they do the same thing.
1716000	1727000	You know I'm not terribly surprised to hear that because I know Dance Maniacs had the upgrade to that years later that would allow extra songs to be added to that machine.
1727000	1732000	There was a whole fan mix, I don't know what you want to call it, that kind of upgraded that machine.
1732000	1737000	So I'm kind of not surprised to hear somebody went back and did the similar treatment to DDR Extreme. That's pretty cool.
1737000	1744000	Yeah, it was just nice to see a lot of the old, especially Dance Mania type licenses and stuff back on that thing.
1744000	1748000	And it felt like, hey, I could actually play most of these songs.
1748000	1757000	Now, and a lot of what we hear about DDR these days, because I know we had some stories going around the blogs recently of like Konami had a world tournament.
1757000	1763000	And all this stuff about DDR, but a lot of it has to do with the score attack or the perfect attack.
1763000	1770000	You know, the actual timing of being able to hit the feet to the arrows with the music and the step charts and all that.
1770000	1781000	But you're here tonight to talk about something a little different, or when I think back to back in the day, the other half of DDR tournaments that got lost somewhere along the way, weirdly.
1781000	1789000	Or maybe it didn't and you're going to correct me, but that would be DDR Freestyle. So for those that don't know, what's DDR Freestyle?
1790000	1803000	So Freestyle is like pretty much going on machine and it's kind of like the performance art side of DDR, where you would actually kind of put up a routine that you sort of pre-plan.
1803000	1809000	And you know, you perform, you do like an actual dance move in tune with the arrows. You know, you kind of like get creative with it.
1809000	1814000	You can do like comedy things. You can like juggle. You can do all sorts of stuff out there.
1814000	1820000	If you just Google or like, you know, YouTube DDR Freestyle, you'll see it. It's like, wow, this is the kind of crazy stuff that people do.
1820000	1831000	And a funny thing, I remember like a few months after I started playing DDR, my friend Ross, he like pings me in ICQ and says, dude, we've been playing this game wrong all this time.
1831000	1838000	And shows me a video from Japan where a dude is practically breakdancing on machine and we're just like, oh damn, that's how you play it.
1838000	1844000	Is that what enabled you to start Freestyle? Because you were pretty big into Freestyle back in the day, right?
1844000	1850000	For our listeners who may not know, what types of like, what types of badges do you have from the DDR Freestyle days?
1850000	1856000	Let's see. Well, I mean, overall, I've won about probably 10 Freestyle tournaments.
1856000	1860000	The first big one that I won, I guess you could say, was Santa Monica Pier in 2000.
1860000	1867000	That was kind of a huge deal because that was the first time like NorCal went down to SoCal and we were like, hey, you know, we can hang with you guys.
1867000	1872000	And it was judged by three guys who were like super big in the DDR scene in Japan at the time.
1872000	1878000	So the fact that one of those judges gave me like a personal award for what I did, I was like, dang, you know?
1878000	1884000	And it just kind of snowballed from there. I won like at Metreon, won in like a couple in SoCal.
1884000	1895000	Actually, an arcade machine I have at home, the DDR Solo 2000 was something that I won at Arcade Infinity 2, that tournament back in 2001.
1895000	1902000	Yeah, that's that's the one I know is the big one because you actually got a DDR machine as a prize. That's a pretty big deal.
1902000	1909000	Yeah, that's not too many machines. I've been won by like just people in general, at least within California.
1909000	1918000	I know if I could think of only maybe three people that won a machine, I'd be myself. I know 8Ball won a machine and Bruce Leroy.
1918000	1921000	Yeah, he won a machine. All freestyle.
1921000	1928000	And if you guys have questions for Mel B or any comments, you can join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com where Bob Coffey says,
1928000	1934000	Whoa, Arcade Infinity, I haven't heard that name in a long time. Yeah, well, it's because they unfortunately went under.
1934000	1939000	They're no longer around. And rest in peace, Arcade Infinity says MXC.
1939000	1944000	But many, many good memories made at Arcade Infinity with these tournaments and so forth.
1944000	1949000	So backing up a little bit, was it that ICQ conversation, which I'm cracking up because you had a conversation on ICQ.
1949000	1956000	Was it an ICQ conversation that led to you getting into freestyle or what enabled you to start this whole freestyle stuff?
1956000	1963000	I think after, you know, obviously when we were first playing the game, we're still just trying to learn to play the game.
1963000	1970000	I kind of had a modicum of how to play rhythm games because my first love was always bust a move slash bust a groove.
1970000	1971000	Heck yeah.
1971000	1975000	That's like, yeah, that game got me into import games and like just music games in general.
1975000	1977000	Me too. Me too. Same drug.
1977000	1982000	Yeah, so when I saw that game for the first time, I was like, dude, this is bust a groove with your feet. I'm totally in.
1982000	1990000	So yeah, after like maybe two or three months of sort of, you know, taking my lumps, getting my ass kicked on like my fire because of all the jumps.
1990000	1996000	Yeah, just once I saw the performance part of it, I'm like, oh, okay, well, that looks cool in me.
1996000	2001000	I mean, it's not like I had a professional dance background or anything like that.
2001000	2008000	I was pretty much like a kid growing up in the 80s and 90s, grew up on like a little bit watching breakdancing on TV.
2008000	2013000	I watched like MTV. It was basically my babysitter between junior high and early college.
2013000	2020000	So I always watch like club MTV, The Grind, all that kind of stuff. I could do everything from like Bobby Brown and like Janet and all that stuff.
2020000	2027000	I just, you know, watched and like played along at home and it's like, whoa, I could kind of do this on DDR and like no one be none the wiser.
2027000	2029000	So I pulled it off.
2029000	2035000	Kids today will never know the wonders of television programs where you just watch other people dance.
2035000	2038000	Dude, Soul Train after Saturday morning cartoons.
2038000	2039000	Right?
2039000	2040000	That was me.
2040000	2045000	Soul Train lines, man. Honestly, that's one of the best rabbit holes you can fall into on YouTube.
2045000	2051000	If you just YouTube, Google like Soul Train dance lines, you have like an instant hour of like pure happiness.
2051000	2059000	And then you Wikipedia who the dancers were, the Soul Train dancers, and find out where they are now, which I spent two nights ago doing that.
2059000	2061000	Damn those Wikipedia black holes.
2061000	2065000	Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like Fred Rerunberry from like What's Happening?
2065000	2072000	Yeah. Like I think it was a couple of guys who joined Shalimar was actually like Jody Watley, Jeffrey, what's his name?
2072000	2075000	But yeah, they were all discovered through Soul Train.
2075000	2081000	So Mel, kind of going back to a point I brought up earlier, you know, DDR, we see it in the news recently.
2081000	2085000	It's kind of come back like DDR, you know, it felt like it kind of went away for a little while.
2085000	2088000	You just you were hearing more about the rock bands and guitar heroes of the world.
2088000	2090000	You weren't really hearing a lot about DDR.
2090000	2099000	And it just feels like within the past few years, especially with DDR Ace, especially with round one kind of becoming bigger and bigger and getting a lot of the DDR machines.
2099000	2102000	Same thing with Dave and Busters are kind of getting a lot of those machines in their arcades.
2102000	2104000	It feels like DDR is coming back a bit.
2104000	2110000	And we do hear about tournaments, but the tournaments really focus on score attack and perfect attack, which is cool.
2110000	2116000	That's the stuff I used to do, you know, when I was much thinner playing DDR back in those days.
2116000	2118000	So that's cool that that's getting all that recognition.
2118000	2122000	But what happened to Freestyle, Mel? Where did the Freestyle go?
2122000	2130000	Honestly, I would say a lot of it died around 2007-ish or so, because it was after, I think, a couple of years of Supernova.
2130000	2135000	And really the arcade releases were kind of few and far in between.
2135000	2141000	It kind of started petering out in USA because we had a lot of competition from the non-dancing games.
2141000	2145000	You know, we had like people playing guitar hero and rock band stuff at home.
2145000	2147000	That's probably one thing.
2147000	2156000	But really it's just, I mean, if I were to believe everything that Jason Enos, who was like the product manager of DDR in USA.
2157000	2161000	He knew that Japan wasn't really big on marketing dance games out here.
2161000	2169000	And just because DDR for like the PlayStation 1 we released that, they only gave us around 2,000 copies.
2169000	2172000	And it sold out so fast and they were like, oh, maybe there is a market.
2172000	2178000	So they threw a few bones here and there and eventually just kind of died out.
2178000	2183000	And then we think past Supernova, I think the last sort of thing was DDRX.
2183000	2189000	Which, as far as a gaming engine, it was actually really smooth but the pads were like complete trash.
2189000	2193000	Because, I think they went to a new different cabinet designer.
2193000	2195000	And just think it picked up by a lot of arcades.
2195000	2201000	A lot of arcades didn't pick up DDRX2 2014 or X2 versus X3.
2201000	2203000	It just kind of flew under the radar.
2203000	2211000	So it wasn't being at the major anchors like say, D&B or like, the arcade scene was already dying as it was.
2211000	2215000	So now we have like this rebirth with say, round one.
2215000	2220000	And like, I know D&B had a big thing like Handshake I guess with Konami to get their machines.
2220000	2226000	This was like the most massive release of DDR now in America.
2226000	2232000	I mean, when a lot of people are just like, they gave the game up for dead, they started playing like, oh, this is cool.
2232000	2239000	And on top of that, now that you have internet ranking for Score Attack, that's where you get a whole bunch of the people back into the game.
2239000	2243000	Because, you know, online gaming has been the thing for a long while.
2243000	2247000	That's why people play at home, because online gaming, you ain't gotta go anywhere.
2247000	2258000	As far as getting the freestyle into the whole thing, it's always been one of those things where you kind of had to have someone who was in the scene to help promote and all that kind of stuff.
2259000	2269000	I guess we just got to the point where we were sick of playing for like 50% of the pot in arcade tokens because, you know, it wasn't as nearly well sponsored.
2269000	2275000	It was just all there was, you know, I mean, a lot of these freestyle tournaments were a lot of a DIY type effort.
2275000	2280000	We did it for love and it was just us, you know, getting together, promoting, helping the community.
2280000	2288000	But if it wasn't for freestyle tournaments and all that stuff back in 2000, 2001, music gaming would not really be where it is now.
2288000	2292000	Because of all those things, that's how Guitar Hero pops off.
2292000	2298000	That's how companies like Red Octane and all that come up with these things and the harmonics, etc, etc.
2298000	2305000	So, I mean, if you really think about people like us, you know, you, me, soccer, all that stuff, it's like we kind of started this revolution.
2305000	2310000	I mean, we don't really think about it actively because we don't want to like be on some high horse and like, oh, yeah, I started that.
2310000	2313000	But, you know, you ask an outsider, you tell them this story.
2313000	2319000	This is kind of, you know, this is our footprint on, you know, gaming society as we know it.
2319000	2328000	Well, you mentioned in there doing it for the love and I have a feeling that is where this event that you're really here to promote kind of comes from is doing it for the love.
2328000	2336000	So, coming up on January 27th, that's this coming Saturday, you guys are going to be having a tournament at Round 1 in San Jose.
2336000	2340000	It is called the DDR Freestyle Takeover Tournament.
2340000	2343000	And this is, if I'm correct, this is a freestyle only tournament.
2343000	2345000	We're not going to have this. We just had Square Attack this last weekend, right?
2345000	2347000	This is freestyle only, right?
2347000	2348000	Freestyle only.
2348000	2349000	Freestyle only.
2349000	2354000	Where did, who started the conversation on, let's bring it back, yo.
2354000	2361000	This was actually done after a few drinks at California Extreme last summer.
2361000	2364000	Aren't the best things after a few drinks.
2364000	2370000	Yeah, we were just taking a break from all the arcade games and I forget what we were talking about.
2370000	2382000	I guess just because we were in Bimani Row for a while and we were just talking tournaments and said, hey, you know, with DDRA back being a thing now, we should totally have a tournament because someone just needs a freestyle to Ariana Grande.
2382000	2383000	This just needs to happen.
2383000	2388000	Mel, is everybody going to freestyle the Ariana Grande?
2388000	2396000	I'll tell you this much. There are a couple of us who are judges and we're all doing exhibitions. None of us are doing it.
2396000	2400000	Okay. All right. Good to know. Good to know. So the Ariana Grande will be limited.
2401000	2408000	Oh, you never know. I mean, it could be the next Highs Off You for all we know or like Brilliant To You or Love To Me.
2408000	2414000	But there are also a lot of other songs there. You can't, I mean, there's Fever. There's some decent songs.
2414000	2432000	The one thing I will say about DDRA where it kind of missed the boat is, you know, it could have been more R&B like danceable songs because that's where freestyle, a lot of the bread and butter comes with those like 100 to 120 BPM R&B like dance type tracks.
2432000	2440000	A lot of the music nowadays kind of tends towards like J-core and like the happy hardcore like kind of stuff.
2440000	2449000	I think that's kind of why Mel, when my buddy JD or anybody else convinces me to get on a DDR machine these days, I'll play Ariana Grande because I kind of have to.
2449000	2457000	But then like after that, I'm kind of like, I want to go play the old shit. Like I want to go back to Fifth Mix and play Ecstasy. You know what I mean?
2457000	2470000	Oh, agreed. I mean, after I play, you know, that song to Warm Up, maybe I'll play like something from the X2 or X3 and then I'll go back to like Supernova and play like Ska Ska No. 3 or like Saturday Night Loves.
2470000	2472000	Because they're just fun.
2472000	2477000	That could just be us being old too. Back in my day, the music was better. But anyway.
2477000	2480000	Wouldn't be wrong. Not by much.
2480000	2488000	Well, we'll see what kind of music selections, because we don't know what people are going to be picking in advance. They're probably still putting the finishing touches on their freestyles.
2488000	2496000	It's not too late to join though, right? If somebody still wants to sign up, if they're for whatever reason hearing this and happen to be in the Bay Area and want to get in on this, it's not too late, right?
2496000	2501000	You can, what's the best way? Go to Facebook or search Eventbrite or what?
2501000	2508000	I'd say the best way to go is go to FreestyleTakeover.com. You have all the information there. It kind of gives us our mission statement.
2508000	2517000	It'll link you there to our Eventbrite page where you can pre-reg. Or, I mean, if just for whatever reason, you can come the day of the event and register.
2517000	2526000	But go to FreestyleTakeover.com or you can search us on Facebook at FreestyleTakeover. You can RSVP that you're interested or that you're going.
2526000	2534000	That's always appreciated too. But yeah, sign up. If you do pre-reg, you get an exclusive competitor swag bag.
2534000	2541000	So, we're trying to incentivize all this. On top of that, there's going to be some pretty awesome stuff for people who place.
2541000	2553000	Nice. Yeah, I'm reading here, first place gets 60% of the pot, second place gets 30%, third place gets 10%, but you guys have extra little bonus things getting thrown in too, huh?
2553000	2558000	Extra little. We've seen the swag bag. There's a custom trophy for first place too.
2558000	2559000	Nice.
2559000	2575000	Yeah, we're getting hot with it. I mean, the whole thing about this tournament, aside from just sort of trying to revive this community and sort of piggybacking off of the newfound popularity of it, is we're just doing this for all the stuff that we're putting into it.
2575000	2591000	We're not really getting much help from elsewhere. This is just five dudes who wanted to pump some life into this. Not only do we want the freestyle scene to thrive again because we know how fun it makes the game look.
2591000	2597000	It's like, think about it, all these people who enter, they could be the next face of freestyle in America, if not the world.
2597000	2612000	Do you think though that these young bucks, these young new faces of freestyle, may have to compete against some returnees? Do you think some of the folks from back in the day will dust off the shoes and give it one more go?
2612000	2619000	Any time you dangle a good amount of money in front of them or some sort of tangible prize, they will come out.
2620000	2629000	I don't profess to follow a lot of sports, but if I'm not mistaken, did some 40-year-old quarterback get another Super Bowl trip today?
2629000	2643000	As a matter of fact, he did. If you look at a common thread along a lot of the freestylers back in the day, a lot of us, we're just competitive guys by nature. If there's money involved, we're going to bust the ass for it. It doesn't matter what it is.
2643000	2655000	It could be a card game, it could be a dance game. I think that's the thing about competition and freestyle. It brings out people who are creative and want to go that extra mile for the goods.
2655000	2657000	I still have an orange bat.
2657000	2661000	Oh, the orange bat of doom. That was a stomp to my beat, right?
2661000	2662000	Yes, it was.
2662000	2669000	If you want to do well, you do want to take some effort to plan out your routine. Don't invent it the day of the contest like a certain co-host.
2669000	2671000	Hey, ours was pure spite.
2671000	2673000	It was fun. We had a good time.
2673000	2683000	Of course, here at Orange Lawn Radio, not all of our listeners are in Northern California. We have folks coast to coast and even in other countries as well. We're very fortunate to have folks that are worldwide.
2683000	2700000	I remember back in the day, if you knew a tournament was happening for us, let's say we knew a tournament was happening at 8 on the break on the East Coast or something, we would have to wait for the AVI or the MOV files to be posted on DDRFreak so we could download them and check it out.
2700000	2706000	Technology has come a long way, hasn't it, Mel? How will folks be able to participate?
2706000	2713000	We have come a long way since people hosting on their FTP servers. Shout out to Vuju and Eugene.
2713000	2714000	Shout out.
2714000	2730000	For the day of the tournament, if you're unable to make it in person, we will be streaming on Twitch. We will have the link on freestyletakeover.com for our channel.
2730000	2746000	That's awesome because maybe you'll have folks in other parts of the US or maybe even other parts of the world that kind of watch this and go, hey, we missed this too. We need to get together and do a tournament in our neck of the woods. Would you hope that something like that happens?
2746000	2754000	It'd be awesome. I mean, I don't want this for us to have some sort of monopoly on this. I'm like, yeah, only we can do the freestyle tournaments and all that kind of stuff.
2754000	2764000	I mean, because if you want something to do well, you want it to do well everywhere, it's not a selfish act by any means.
2765000	2778000	The only freestyle I can think of for DDR that I know is even out there, there's one team in Japan actually called Team Pandasan. I know they do Pump It Up as well as DDR. Those caps are good.
2779000	2794000	So yeah, give them Team Pandasan. They still capture the fun and creativity that made people actually download stuff in our DDR fields.
2794000	2802000	Because if you try to watch a PA tournament, it's funny because you're not really looking at the people, you're just watching the screen to see who slips up, who's the one that gets the great first.
2802000	2810000	So in a way, it's not a fun thing to look at if you're not even looking at the players. When you're watching freestyle, you are looking at the player. They are the center of attention.
2810000	2822000	This is where the personalities come out. I think freestyle is just, we're different cats, but in a good way. It's not like where everything PA is not, therefore we're better.
2822000	2832000	No, we're two different tastes that you can appreciate for different reasons. So that's why when we did Freestyle Takeover, this is absolutely not a slight at Score Attack people.
2832000	2844000	If not for them, being at the KAC last year, like the guy Chris for Life, he from America won that whole entire thing.
2844000	2858000	So yeah, we have him and we have the guy Jeff Bunga, who I think he was in third place or something. Those guys brought a lot of shine to the game we've seen out here. I know Chris got his own expose on Polygon and stuff like that.
2858000	2873000	I don't see the two as competition for each other at all. For me, it's kind of like the DDR tournaments back in the day always had both. So this is kind of like a yin and a yang type of thing. This is bringing back the other half in a way.
2873000	2891000	Yeah, we have something by having Freestyle and by having Perfect Attack. I think the Score Attack leads to people who are more hardcore DDR fans and want to see that sort of competition, just see the elite people going against each other.
2891000	2901000	Freestyle is something like, if it's done well, you can just show your friends at work and be like, yeah, this is the goofy stuff that we do. We're about mass appeal and fun.
2901000	2912000	Nice. Well, I wish you guys the best of luck with the tournament. Again, this is the DDR Freestyle Takeover Tournament. You can check out more information at freestyletakeover.com, including Twitch links the day of the tournament.
2912000	2922000	It is scheduled to start at round one, three o'clock. That's three o'clock Pacific this Saturday. So if you are around the world, that would be a little bit later or maybe earlier, depending on where you're at.
2922000	2936000	Again, that's the round one in San Jose at the Eastridge Mall. And I know I'm going to be taking the trip out there to make a cameo, just like the good old days, so I can watch and absorb what's going on. So I can come right back here on this program and talk about it, just like I used to.
2936000	2939000	Bring the doctor. Bring the doctor back.
2939000	2941000	Oh, he got deported back to Canada.
2941000	2949000	Oh, you mean deported? I figured he would have left on his own terms after, you know, everything that went on in this country.
2949000	2964000	It was a little bit of both. It was a little bit of both. But like I said, you don't want to come up with routines the day of, and that was always the good doctor's trick. So I don't know. Maybe when you come back for Freestyle Takeover 2019 and I'm 30 pounds lighter, maybe we can talk about that.
2964000	2966000	Let's make it happen, Captain.
2966000	2977000	All right. Mel, best of luck to you and everyone involved. I know it's not just you, but you've got a whole team of guys doing that over there. And best of luck to everybody there, and I look forward to seeing it in person this Saturday.
2978000	2984000	Oh, yeah. Thanks so much for having me. And congrats on your new podcast, for sure.
2984000	2986000	Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
2986000	2989000	So, Mel, is this a return to RTF?
2989000	2998000	Ooh, now we're getting to exhibit zone where it's like, you know, sub talk, I heard you like returns. So we'll return to return to RTF.
2998000	3001000	It would be re-RTF.
3001000	3002000	It would be RTRTF.
3002000	3006000	Re-return. Re-return to Freestyle.
3006000	3014000	Stay tuned. We'll find out. By the way, some comments here over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Muster saying it was nice hearing a bit of DDR history. I miss arcades.
3014000	3021000	Guess what, Dungeon Muster? Depending on where you're at, they're still there. I mean, round one seems to be doing very well as a chain. They're kind of growing. I hear they're opening up more locations.
3021000	3027000	Dave and Busters, they're doing pretty well. I know a lot of like throwback retro arcades, especially arcades and bars.
3027000	3028000	We have coin op here.
3028000	3039000	Yeah, like we have coin op here locally, but those those types of things are showing up everywhere. And many of those places have DDR machines, although wouldn't recommend mixing alcohol and DDR, but it's been known to happen.
3039000	3050000	Hence where my alter ego probably came from in the first place. Oh, and of course, I have to ask this because Orange Right reminded me of this in chat. I can't believe I forgot to ask this question, so I'll end on this.
3050000	3054000	Mel, will Matrix Walks be allowed in the competition?
3054000	3059000	Oh, that is actually one of the rules we specifically addressed and no.
3059000	3072000	Womp womp. But it's understandable because if you don't know what a Matrix Walk is, you know, remember the movie The Matrix where they would like run up the walls and then kind of, well, there used to be a move where you could actually run up the DDR machine.
3072000	3073000	And that was terrible.
3073000	3081000	Yeah, and it doesn't treat, I mean, it looks impressive the first time you see it, but then you think, oh shit, that machine really shouldn't be kept.
3081000	3084000	I would be disappointed if there wasn't at least one caution drop.
3084000	3087000	It is an expensive piece of technology.
3087000	3105000	And if people come down to round one, Eastridge, it's like, you can see just how much music games have evolved with a lot of new machines. I know there's Dance Evolution out there, which I haven't seen very many machines around at all, which is pretty much like Dance Central slash Dance Masters.
3105000	3111000	Oh yeah, they have like the machine out there and I need someone to play because I think I'm one of two people that play that game.
3111000	3124000	I've been getting into randomly out here in Rockland in my neck of the woods, they have Neon FM and that's like something, it's kind of like American pop music in a way. That's like a really lazy way to describe it. It's really the best thing I can think of and I've been like kind of into that lately.
3124000	3130000	Okay, I've heard some like whispers and rumblings that round one may be coming to Sacramento.
3130000	3131000	God, I hope so.
3131000	3132000	I really hope so.
3132000	3140000	We just got a place called, I keep wanting to say it's called Punch Drunk Social, but it's like Punch Bowl Social.
3140000	3146000	And it just kind of sounds like Dave and Busters meets the Real Housewives of El Dorado County.
3146000	3150000	So I'm a little confused on it, but I've yet to visit.
3150000	3154000	Do I have to play DDR while balancing a glass of wine in my hand?
3154000	3156000	I would love if we got a round one.
3156000	3159000	There's like a Franzia box just right by the machine.
3159000	3163000	All right. Hey, we're planning our routine for 2019. Stay tuned.
3163000	3165000	Franzia box. Yes.
3165000	3168000	All right. Mel, thank you so much for coming on the show. I know it was short notice.
3168000	3170000	And again, I will see you on Saturday.
3170000	3174000	Okay. Glad to see you all. And y'all have a good rest of the evening. Thanks again.
3174000	3177000	And everybody, freestyletakeover.com.
3177000	3181000	All right. Freestyletakeover.com. We'll see you on Saturday. Thanks again, Mel.
3181000	3183000	Thanks. You have a great one.
3183000	3184000	You too.
3184000	3190000	Good old Mel B from episode six to episode seven hundred and fifteen.
3190000	3193000	There he is talking about freestyle all these years later.
3193000	3198000	Hey, I am all for that. So you got to you got to bring in the old and bring in the new,
3198000	3201000	which is kind of, you know, coming off the heels of I just mentioned,
3201000	3204000	just launched episode one of a new podcast tonight.
3204000	3207000	So hopefully this one lasts a little longer than Pokestop did.
3207000	3212000	But sometimes you get one that goes a long time.
3212000	3215000	Sometimes you don't. But I wish nothing but the best for this.
3215000	3219000	I think Monday Comics Mania made it five episodes. You went longer than that.
3219000	3223000	Maybe. Yeah. But I did make make a friend through that podcast.
3223000	3228000	Yeah. Because we had Todd Stashwick on the show.
3228000	3233000	Now he's like really successful with 12 Monkeys on sci fi.
3233000	3236000	And he had been on The Riches, but I always remembered him from Supernatural.
3236000	3240000	Yeah. When I did The Horde House show for a long time with you guys know Grandpa,
3240000	3245000	Next Fur and Shane, we did The Horde House. That one lasted a good 130 some odd episodes.
3245000	3247000	That was a pretty good run for Horde House.
3247000	3250000	I got we got some people that were like really into the Blizzard games,
3250000	3253000	like World of Warcraft that kind of came over here to OLR because of it.
3253000	3256000	So, you know, just girl, you mentioned the wow.
3256000	3259000	Well, I guess we should talk about our gaming weeks.
3259000	3263000	What a nice transition into the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
3263000	3268000	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week? I started on wow again.
3268000	3272000	And apparently I had a demon hunter on Proudmoore,
3272000	3275000	but I'm in some guild and I think it's one Shane added me to.
3275000	3281000	So I we need we need our guild. We need to make our guild.
3281000	3283000	I want to talk about wow in a minute.
3283000	3284000	OK. All right.
3284000	3290000	But I also remembered I had like my troll named Einaj, who was backwards of Jaina.
3290000	3292000	So she was fun.
3292000	3299000	But yeah, I think it was also the same server I had Gyaru on my my elf pretty bitch.
3299000	3305000	Anyway, so I played well, did Legion stuff because I had my my demon hunty.
3305000	3310000	And then I have been playing.
3310000	3317000	Really, not a lot, just Pokemon ingress when I feel like walking.
3317000	3320000	What else did I play? Oh, yeah, I'm playing Animal Crossing.
3320000	3323000	Of course, because it's adorbs.
3323000	3326000	Didn't they finally announced they're adding like clothing customization?
3326000	3329000	Yeah, they actually you can craft clothes now.
3329000	3331000	Abel and Mabel, are they back?
3331000	3335000	It's not customization yet. They give you outfits you can craft.
3335000	3339000	And like crafting five outfits will give you like 10 leaf leaf tickets.
3339000	3341000	So that's not bad.
3341000	3346000	They have like Rovers Garden rally or whatever.
3346000	3350000	And then you catch butterflies and you get all these achievements for butterfly catching.
3350000	3356000	And it's kind of fun. You know, I've just been I'm level 56 now.
3356000	3360000	So and of course, I'm still playing Miitomo, kind of.
3360000	3362000	All right. That's it.
3362000	3365000	All right. My gaming week. So I also played WoW for a little bit.
3365000	3369000	But here's the thing. I don't like that new patch. They put out a new patch on Tuesday.
3369000	3372000	I'm not a fan. Have you tried to go back and do any old content, Jamie?
3372000	3373000	Not yet.
3373000	3377000	The old I first thing I did was I did a dungeon because I was working on my shaman on my alliance side.
3377000	3379000	And the first thing I did was I rolled into a dungeon.
3379000	3386000	And it wasn't like like I get that the dungeons before were pretty face roll, but they kind of amped it up like too much.
3386000	3390000	And it was just taking too much time to get through stuff.
3390000	3392000	And of course, the other people in the party weren't used to it.
3392000	3395000	So nobody's doing crowd control or that stuff because you didn't have to before.
3395000	3400000	Like, unfortunately, I kind of feel like it went from one extreme to another and it just wasn't very fun.
3400000	3409000	And so meanwhile, while all of that is going on, you know, I did some kind of did a lot of thinking on Final Fantasy 14 and kind of what I was doing in that game.
3409000	3421000	And I made a really tough decision to actually transfer servers in Final Fantasy 14 to kind of see if I could get reinvigorated for the game there, which sucks because I really enjoyed the group that I was playing with before.
3421000	3434000	But because unfortunately, one big thing I love 14, but one massive thing that it lacks that WoW does better is the fact in is that in WoW, it doesn't really matter what servers your friends are on.
3434000	3443000	At the end of the day, if I really want to play with somebody who happens to be on another server in the same country, there still is a wall with the Europe servers and the Asian servers and all that.
3443000	3448000	But if I want to play with one of my friends on whatever server, we can dungeon together, we can raid together.
3448000	3455000	And Final Fantasy 14 is starting to get there. It got mostly there the last patch, but the problem is there's still two different data centers.
3455000	3461000	So I had some really good friends of mine and we've promoted their podcast here on this show before. They do a show called Astral Era.
3461000	3466000	And I've been wanting to play with those guys for a long, long time. Things were really slowing down on the old server.
3466000	3473000	So I was like, all right, I'm going to make a really tough choice and I'm going to say, I'm going to go over here and play with my Astral Era buddies for a little while.
3473000	3480000	And I'm just going to hope and I'm going to cross my fingers that at some point, Square Enix is able to get their servers the way WoW is and I can play with my old friends again.
3480000	3486000	And I don't have to make tough choices like these. But for now, that's what I did. And it's tough, it's tough.
3486000	3494000	But in some ways it did kind of reinvigorate 14 for me. So yes, I'm still paying for two MMOs.
3495000	3502000	I'm going to keep giving WoW, especially now that you're playing WoW again. And I think the Game Buoy guys are checking out WoW again.
3502000	3505000	So I have reasons to kind of go back and give that another chance.
3505000	3509000	Does this mean I can't go back and roll old dungeons and just plow through them, though?
3509000	3520000	At first, no. And they screwed some stuff up. Like, you couldn't even go hunting for mounts in old raids because the old raids would sync up to your level.
3520000	3522000	You pick it now?
3522000	3528000	I think, supposedly, I haven't checked, but they were supposed to do a patch that fixed a lot of that on Friday.
3528000	3531000	Because definitely a lot of players weren't happy about that.
3531000	3538000	Because I was basically just rolling through those old dungeons trying to get the achievements out of them.
3538000	3546000	You know, now that I can, I mean, me and, I don't think it was me and John, it was me and someone else.
3546000	3551000	Just went in and we were plowing through all of the Warlords stuff.
3551000	3553000	And that's fun to do, you know?
3553000	3556000	Once we hit, like, rating level, we could go plow through them, you know?
3556000	3563000	Yeah, you steamroll it, but at the same time you get to see elements of the story that you might have missed because you haven't been paying for the game for 12 years straight.
3563000	3565000	Or, however, 13 years straight, or however long that game's been around.
3565000	3571000	So, anyway, so hopefully the WoW patch stuff, again, I haven't checked it out since Tuesday, the day the patch came out.
3571000	3574000	I understand they've done some fixes, so I am going to give it a second shot.
3574000	3580000	Because, of course, I got billed for my month, like, the day before the patch hit, so I still have time to make a decision on that.
3580000	3586000	But now I'm juggling two MMOs, and I'm still trying to play stuff in between as well, but I'm still super into Heroes of the Storm.
3586000	3592000	Like, I was actually watching a competitive competition on Heroes of the Storm the other day, because I'm starting to understand the game a lot better.
3592000	3596000	I still mostly stick to AI, but, like, I'm finding so many heroes that I enjoy playing.
3596000	3603000	I'll play with you again, because I've got, I was playing Illidan for a while, which, he dies squishy, you know, which is weird.
3603000	3607000	But he's a lot of fun, and I think I just unlocked Sylvanas.
3607000	3614000	Yeah. Well, and if you haven't played in a long time, you probably never redeem the thing where you just get 20 heroes for free.
3614000	3615000	Probably.
3615000	3617000	So there's, like, a ton of stuff you can get. Yeah, definitely check it out.
3617000	3621000	Okay, because, I mean, now that I'm playing, you know, I want to get back into playing more stuff more often.
3621000	3622000	Yeah, cool.
3622000	3629000	And I actually mentioned today and today that I wanted to bust out the Dreamcast and finish my Grandia 2, for one thing.
3629000	3635000	Which, I was so happy with that game, it's one of the few that the Japanese save files will work on the American game.
3635000	3640000	So, because I'd already gotten, like, a third through the game on the Japanese version.
3640000	3647000	I don't talk a lot about the mobile gaming stuff that I do, but I think it's worth a shout out that I did participate in the Pokémon GO Community Day yesterday.
3647000	3654000	Because once a month they do these community days for Pokémon GO, so I have friends that play that.
3654000	3658000	They don't play, you know, Ingress that we were talking about last week, but they play Pokémon GO.
3658000	3666000	And so we all went downtown. We were a little worried because they had the huge march downtown yesterday, too.
3666000	3674000	But that was all kind of on the west side of the capital, so it left the east side of the capital to be the Wailmer Farms slash Shiny Pikachus.
3674000	3684000	And I caught four Shiny Pikachus yesterday because, you know, every lure or every stop at the capital was lured up and Pikachus were showing up everywhere.
3684000	3691000	And I think all three of us that did that together yesterday really agreed. That was a really cool, like, thing that Niantic did.
3691000	3696000	And it seems like they're going to be doing this more. They're going to do it once a month. And I think that's great.
3696000	3706000	I had a great time yesterday just going out and taking a walk around the capital and playing cell phone games with people I don't always get to play cell phone games with because we don't always play the same thing.
3706000	3714000	So, yeah, I had a lot of fun. So, kudos to Niantic. I know I give them a lot of shit sometimes on the show, but I thought the community event was a lot of fun.
3714000	3718000	I just hope the next one isn't Shiny Pikachu again, but I don't think it will be.
3718000	3720000	I hope it is because I missed it.
3720000	3730000	Well, the good news is Shiny Pikachus didn't get deleted. It's just that the odds of getting one yesterday were really good. Like, you know, again, I caught four out of maybe the 120.
3730000	3733000	I wish that they would, like, bring in trading.
3733000	3743000	Yeah, because I'd happily trade you one. So because I also got Kyogre yesterday. That made me very happy, although I had I got I was getting so frustrated at Kyogre.
3743000	3753000	I was like, Shane, you keep catching him. You do it. And he used my phone and he caught it. So technically, Shane caught the Kyogre for me, but I don't care. It's mine.
3753000	3766000	Looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, actdef says it needs to be more hours. I was actually busy during the time the event was. Yeah, that's the number one complaint I'm hearing is that it was only like a three hour event and it should have been a little longer.
3766000	3776000	And so, yeah, I kind of agree with that. And rawcat in chat says I got no Shiny Pikachu. Well, the good news isn't the same thing I'm telling DarkSakura is that Shiny Pikachus didn't go away. You could still get one.
3776000	3783000	It's just the odds are still kind of odds are going to be a little yucky. But Shinies are Shinies are supposed to be a little special.
3783000	3798000	SSG100Matt in chat, ouch, ouch, says my girlfriend caught seven shiny Pikachus. I got zero. Well, sorry to hear that, buddy. Hopefully trading opens up for you, too. There you go.
3799000	3806000	All right. Well, I just caught a Nidoran in your bathroom. Congratulations. Thank you for getting him out of the bathroom.
3806000	3812000	It was a lady. How dare you assume gender. Thank you for getting in the bathroom. And look, the bitch ran, so whatever.
3812000	3819000	All right. Let's get into I don't think I have any other announcements here. We still have plenty of shows coming up next week on the show.
3819000	3826000	Definitely. I'll be talking about the DDR tournament next week. And yeah, I'm going on a trip in March, but that's still like two months away.
3826000	3832000	But that's all booked, signed, sealed, delivered. I'm going on a jet plane. I'm going to Atlanta off season.
3832000	3839000	I'm not going for Dragon Con. I'm going for other stuff. I'm going to Drag Con. Are you? I wish you'd go to Dragon Con someday.
3839000	3848000	It's so much fun. I got to get I got to get Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling, which, by the way, shout out to that show because they had me on as a guest this past week.
3848000	3853000	I forgot to shout them out earlier, but shout out Starboard Power Coupling. We got to talk about Star Trek Discovery.
3853000	3861000	The first two episodes back from the break. So that was a lot of fun because I had some things to say about it, especially especially the big twist in that first episode.
3861000	3868000	I had some things to say about that. So anyway, but I don't want to spoil for those I haven't seen yet because some people are waiting to binge it when it's all out.
3868000	3875000	They're going to get CBS all access in February and binge the whole thing, which makes sense. Anyway, you have to check out Starboard Power Coupling if you want to hear.
3875000	3882000	Let's get in some more gaming news. We have plenty of gaming news going on this week. It's a it's kind of a quiet week, but not really.
3882000	3888000	We still had we still had stuff here and there. So Jamie's going to start us off. Well, we're getting Forza Fable. Kidding.
3888000	3895000	Basically, Playground Games, who did Forza Horizon, is working on a Fable title.
3895000	3902000	So it is in new hands and hopefully won't, you know, suck. Fable 3 was not great.
3902000	3908000	I'm just saying I didn't hate it. I didn't like it either. But Fable 2 was great.
3908000	3912000	Yeah. Yeah. It's like it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.
3912000	3921000	I love Forza Horizon. Forza Horizon is probably like my favorite Xbox exclusive thing. Like it's just it's a great racing, but it feels more arcadey.
3921000	3927000	See, there's racing sims and like racing arcade and Forza Horizon is a great racing arcade game. And I really enjoy it.
3927000	3934000	Now, of course, people are going to think that means, oh, then this means that they're going to bring cars into Fable.
3934000	3940000	Well, they might, but at the same time, can't a developer do different genres?
3940000	3945000	I would bet that a lot of those types of studios probably get really bored of making the same thing over and over,
3945000	3951000	which is why they eventually hand it off to someone else. Hence how Mass Effect got ruined for Jamie and I.
3951000	3954000	So sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't work.
3954000	3961000	Well, at any rate, they're saying that it's not going to be out very soon.
3962000	3972000	Playgrounds has a new office in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. So this is being developed in the UK.
3972000	3980000	Once they've got their people hired, then they're looking to start development at that point,
3980000	3987000	which I hope it doesn't fall into, you know, development hell, you know, and then get canceled.
3987000	3992000	Like, what was it? Fable Legends?
3992000	3995000	Yeah, Fable Legends was that whole I think it was gonna be free to play or something.
3995000	4000000	And it kind of it showed up one E3 and then it fizzled out, which was really sad for Lionhead games,
4000000	4001000	because, you know, you don't like to...
4001000	4002000	Lionhead is no more now.
4002000	4006000	Yeah, I know it's I know it's but I don't like people losing their jobs.
4006000	4007000	No, not at all.
4007000	4009000	Hopefully they got hired by these guys or somewhere else.
4009000	4015000	Possibly. But at any rate, you know, the last time we had a Fable game was Fable anniversary in 2014.
4015000	4016000	It's been a long time.
4016000	4017000	Well, four years.
4017000	4021000	Yeah, but Fable anniversary was just like a rebranding of older stuff.
4021000	4023000	I don't think it was anything new, new.
4023000	4027000	Looking in chat, by the way, talking about studios going from one genre to another,
4027000	4030000	Dungeon Buster points out in chat at live.vognetwork.com,
4030000	4033000	Guerrilla Games did nothing but Killzone for years.
4033000	4037000	Then they made Cyber Monster Hunter, a.k.a. Horizon Zero Dawn,
4037000	4042000	which was obviously a huge thing on the PlayStation 4.
4042000	4045000	So, yeah, that's been like a game of the year for a lot of people.
4045000	4050000	Going back to read some other comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
4050000	4053000	SSJ100Matt talking about the Pokemon Community Day saying,
4053000	4057000	We had a huge turnout in Central Park, at least a couple hundred.
4057000	4060000	There were a lot of people from the Silph Road community there.
4060000	4062000	Yeah, I follow Silph Road.
4062000	4065000	I'm kind of more of an observer there over on Reddit.
4065000	4068000	I know they have a huge Reddit and they do really good at kind of digging in
4068000	4071000	what changes with the different patches and things like that.
4072000	4076000	But I didn't really participate in any sort of official meetup like that,
4076000	4080000	although I'm sure they were doing something here in Sacramento, I'm sure,
4080000	4082000	where our show is based.
4082000	4085000	Dungeon Buster also continuing about Fable saying,
4085000	4088000	Fable was neat. It had its issues as a series,
4088000	4092000	but I'm interested to see how this new Fable might turn out.
4092000	4094000	And then Ragenator in chat says,
4094000	4098000	Forza plus Fable equals Forzable.
4098000	4101000	That might be one way to name it, I suppose.
4101000	4107000	Bobby Black Wolf saying that one of the games he actually completed was Fable 2.
4107000	4113000	That is definitely an accomplishment knowing that Bobby Black Wolf
4113000	4116000	actually went and beat your game, that's for sure.
4116000	4121000	So, let's talk a little bit about, speaking of remakes and things of that sort,
4121000	4125000	I want to talk about Disgaea, Hour of Darkness.
4125000	4129000	Apparently Disgaea, Hour of Darkness is getting an HD remake
4129000	4131000	for its 15th anniversary.
4131000	4134000	This was announced in a Nippon Ichi stream
4134000	4138000	that they are going to be doing a Disgaea, Hour of Darkness HD remake.
4138000	4141000	There's no gameplay footage out or anything like that,
4141000	4146000	but Nippon Ichi did announce a release window of this summer.
4146000	4149000	Disgaea, of course, the original was a PlayStation 2 game.
4149000	4152000	It was on the PSP, you know, pour one out for the PSP.
4152000	4154000	It was on the Nintendo DS, and at one point it was on the PC.
4154000	4156000	So, we don't have screenshots, we don't have release dates,
4156000	4157000	we don't have anything like that,
4157000	4164000	but Disgaea is going to be the next game getting a PC remake.
4164000	4167000	So, were you a fan of Disgaea, Dark Sakura?
4167000	4169000	Not really. I didn't play it.
4169000	4178000	It was around that time when I was just really not into as many games of that type,
4178000	4183000	but Disgaea had a big following, so I'm sure fans will be pleased to find a new version.
4184000	4188000	It's one of those things where I played it a little bit on the PlayStation 2,
4188000	4192000	but, you know, gaming ADD, I never really got around to finishing it,
4192000	4194000	and then there were all these sequels.
4194000	4197000	So, this will be a good chance to go back and give it another go,
4197000	4198000	which hopefully makes sense.
4198000	4200000	Yeah, no problem there.
4200000	4204000	So, I have news for people who are like me,
4204000	4211000	who like to play games on their PC or Mac,
4211000	4218000	although I planned on getting Dragon Ball FighterZ on PlayStation 4.
4218000	4223000	This is for people who are going to be playing it on PC,
4223000	4225000	and let you know what you're going to need for your requirements.
4225000	4229000	So, I figured I'd go ahead and do y'all a favor and give you the stuff.
4229000	4233000	So, at the very minimum, you do need to be at lowest Windows 7,
4234000	4242000	have an AMD FX4350 4.2 gigahertz Intel Core i5.
4242000	4246000	Sorry, brain.
4246000	4251000	Or an Intel Core i5 at minimum 3.2 gigahertz, 4 gigabytes of RAM.
4251000	4257000	Graphics card recommended minimum Radeon HD 6870 with 1 gig of RAM,
4257000	4260000	or GeForce GTX 650 Ti.
4260000	4262000	That was actually my last graphics card.
4262000	4268000	I upgraded mine about six months ago with 1 gigabyte DirectX 11,
4268000	4272000	and of course the DirectX compatible sound card or onboard chipset.
4272000	4277000	Recommended, it actually doesn't look like,
4277000	4280000	it's going to want a faster processor,
4280000	4285000	but it's really not looking for anything great graphics card wise,
4285000	4287000	like it's saying a GeForce GTX 660.
4287000	4289000	That's not terrible.
4289000	4292000	I mean, that's a few years old.
4292000	4295000	So, yeah, they're saying older computers are going to be able to run it.
4295000	4299000	It really did surprise me just how modest the requirements are,
4299000	4302000	you know, by terms of what people have now,
4302000	4309000	so I could only think of how much better it would play on a higher end system.
4309000	4312000	I mean, and it's using Unreal 4 for its graphics engine,
4312000	4315000	and it's the same one that Street Fighter V uses,
4315000	4321000	or Tekken 7, which also look really, really good on a PC.
4321000	4329000	So, I think I might eventually pick it up on PC when price drops,
4329000	4333000	but I'm going to play it on PS4, because I can use my,
4333000	4338000	we've got arcade controllers for PS4, like fighting controllers.
4338000	4340000	Sure, got to be authentic.
4340000	4343000	Some people in chat wondering how serious you might take this.
4343000	4348000	Tigerclaw in chat saying Dragon Ball Fighter Z is no doubt going to be huge in the fighting game tournaments.
4348000	4353000	So, maybe it's time to practice it, because perhaps someday you'll become the Dragon Ball Fighter Z champion.
4353000	4354000	You want to know what?
4354000	4357000	Or Dragon Ball fighters. Are you supposed to say Fighter Z or fighters?
4357000	4359000	It's Fighter Z from what I understand.
4359000	4360000	Okay.
4360000	4368000	But I am not, the last tournament that I was in that had nothing to do with DDR was Bust-A-Move 2.
4368000	4370000	Which is kind of adjacent in a way.
4370000	4377000	Well, and on top of that, it was the one where they gave me a busted controller that they replaced after I got eliminated.
4377000	4383000	I had been playing in mix mode before that for like an hour, and no one could beat me. So, just saying.
4383000	4384000	Nice.
4384000	4389000	I think this was at, wasn't it fun? It was at an AX. It was at an anime expo, so it was a while back.
4389000	4394000	I think I did some tournament at Magfest. Somebody talked me into doing it. I don't know if I did Smash or something.
4394000	4395000	It was something I wasn't even good at.
4395000	4405000	I'm not really competitive by nature, I guess. I mean, I get competitive, but I more participate in things just because I'll have fun doing it.
4405000	4406000	Yeah.
4406000	4407000	I don't care about winning.
4407000	4408000	But the competition can be fun.
4408000	4416000	That part's not fun for me. I'm not a competitor. The only person I like to compete against is myself.
4416000	4417000	Okay.
4417000	4435000	And so, and I don't like a whole lot of attention on me, you know? I mean, yeah, I may be kind of vocal and loud when it comes to being on a podcast or being on social media, but in person, you know, I don't really like that much attention on me.
4435000	4446000	Well, but this is also like for, you know, podcasting in general can be an outlet of sorts for a lot of people. Like, just, you know, the way I am on here may not always reflect exactly.
4446000	4451000	Like, I think in real life, I might be a lot more quiet until I get to know you and then I open up.
4451000	4452000	Girl.
4452000	4453000	No, well, it just depends.
4453000	4454000	Sometimes.
4454000	4462000	You haven't seen me around people I don't know. I kind of go like, ooh. But, you know, I also tell people, like, if you see me at a convention or something like that, I'm a normal fucking person.
4462000	4467000	Just come up and say hi, you know, as long as you're not creepy, like it's in which most people aren't.
4467000	4475000	So, you know, just say hi. I'm, you know, and I always am flattered when people recognize me from this whole thing. So, yeah.
4475000	4480000	But sometimes I worry that I might come off as guarded or something because I don't talk a lot unless I like know the situation.
4480000	4483000	I know the people. So, wow. That got off topic from that original chat.
4483000	4484000	It sure did.
4485000	4494000	Off topic on this show, you don't say. Well, let's talk about competition because this is something that I didn't really get a chance to get into last week.
4494000	4497000	Because a lot of people were talking about it last week and now a lot of people are talking about it this week.
4497000	4506000	Obviously, we were focused on Ingress and our guests that were here last week. So, we didn't really get a chance to talk about the Overwatch League.
4506000	4513000	So, the Overwatch League launched last week and it made a come – it kind of came back in the news.
4513000	4517000	I don't want to say it made a comeback because it's kind of – a lot of people are like super into Overwatch League.
4517000	4519000	I've been seeing a lot of tweets about it and so forth.
4519000	4527000	If for whatever reason you don't know what Overwatch League is, it's basically a big push by Blizzard to get Overwatch, you know, more into esports.
4527000	4538000	But to be more akin to what you would see in a league that's like a NFL type of league or an NBA or a traditional, if you will, sports league.
4538000	4542000	Overwatch League, I believe the vision there is to kind of do a hybrid.
4542000	4547000	And – well, let me get into the story and then I'll get into some of my thoughts here.
4547000	4553000	So, a story that's making its way around the internet this week and many people have actually seen this video.
4553000	4557000	The Overwatch League did end up suspending a player this week.
4557000	4562000	Dallas Fuel had their player xQc, whose name is Felix.
4562000	4571000	He was suspended by the league and by Fuel because what he did, he actually said something that wasn't too nice on a Twitch stream of his.
4571000	4580000	I believe he said something around the fact that this other player who goes by Muma, who's on another team, the Houston Outlaws.
4580000	4584000	So, there's kind of that whole Texas rivalry, I guess, thing going on.
4584000	4590000	It was basically something like, go suck a fat cock, but you might like that type of thing.
4590000	4595000	And so, it just – it was kind of – well, it wasn't kind of. It was shitty.
4595000	4597000	Like, I don't know how to say it.
4597000	4600000	I was actually going to try to find – I wanted to find the video. I thought I had the –
4600000	4602000	Well, depending on where that cock's been, literally.
4602000	4608000	I was going to try to find the video here, but unfortunately, I thought I had linked myself to it.
4609000	4617000	Well, let me ask you this. Before not considering this story here, let me ask Jamie this to buy me a little time while I find this video so you can draw your own conclusion.
4617000	4623000	What do you think about the concept of Overwatch League? Not considering this part of it, what do you think about the concept of the Overwatch League?
4623000	4630000	If they have fun doing it, sure. You know? I have no problem with that.
4630000	4639000	I have no problem with being competitive or forming, you know, teams to play Overwatch. If they have fun doing it that way, good for them.
4639000	4649000	You know? And it did harm none. Do what you will. You know? But when you start harming other people in it, then that's when it becomes too much.
4649000	4654000	Okay. Here's the clip. I finally found it. So, judge for yourself what's happening here.
4654000	4657000	So, this is, again, xQc live on his stream.
4660000	4672000	Get fucked! I don't play, bitch! I fucking smoked it, dude. No. No. He didn't smoke shit. Shut your fucking mouth. Go back there. Suck a fat cock. I mean, he would like it, but...
4676000	4680000	That's not a thing. That's not a thing, dude. Please.
4680000	4683000	Now, what you kinda can't see...
4683000	4685000	And it's my line, too. Like, what?
4685000	4694000	What you kinda can't see happening there is that once those words left his mouth, his jaw kinda dropped and he kinda had that moment of like, oh, fuck.
4694000	4703000	You know, like, I probably shouldn't have said that. So, like, for me, I'm kinda getting that, like, instant, like, he had this moment like, oh, shit, I shouldn't have said that.
4703000	4711000	And my understanding is that the other player involved in this, Muma, did say in his own videos that, like, he kinda just doesn't give a fuck type of thing.
4711000	4716000	Like, he's, you know, probably focused on the game or whatever and he's, him and this guy have kinda buried the hatchet.
4716000	4727000	But the league in its response was immediate. They, you know, before the next match, they ended up suspending this player for a game and I think he got a $2,000 fine, it was.
4727000	4738000	And then, actually, the team, the Dallas Fuel came out and said, we support what the Overwatch League did and actually, we're gonna bench him until Stage 2 starts in early February.
4738000	4744000	And some people, you know, that's where the debate is. Was this punishment too harsh? Was, you know, are we overreacting, da da da?
4744000	4753000	And, you know, I have to say, in one hand, it does kinda suck for the dude because I do see that he kinda has that remorse, you know, like, instantly.
4753000	4757000	Or at least, that's kinda, you know, what I'm taking away from it when I'm watching this.
4757000	4764000	But at the same time, dude, like, in the beginning of that clip, before he gets that, he's running his mouth constantly, right?
4764000	4769000	And he's, like, doing all these different voices. Like, he's got, like, verbal diarrhea or something.
4769000	4777000	And, like, I get to do, like, a Twitch stream. You have to be entertaining sometimes, but you have to be very careful about the things that come out of your mouth.
4777000	4783000	And obviously, you know, this guy recognizes it. He has, you know, written some tweets on it since. He crossed a line.
4783000	4789000	And the problem here is, is that you are representing Overwatch and you are representing this league.
4789000	4794000	And you did, you know, a negative thing, so this is the punishment.
4794000	4803000	So, at least I will give to this guy's credit. He does seem to, I wanna say man up, but woman up or, you know, person up.
4803000	4805000	Or maybe just be an adult.
4805000	4810000	Yes, he's being an adult and accepting his licks and we're hopefully all gonna be able to move on from this.
4810000	4812000	If only other people could follow suit, you know?
4812000	4818000	Right. So, and here's my thing. And I gotta go back to talking about Overwatch League a little bit in general.
4818000	4822000	Because I'm glad the league responded as fast as they did.
4822000	4828000	Because maybe it goes to show that this kind of talk isn't really acceptable in their game either.
4828000	4832000	Because I think we all know that Overwatch has a pretty toxic community right now.
4832000	4842000	So, I hope maybe this little slap kind of goes to show that Blizzard is taking some of this seriously and doesn't wanna see it in their game either.
4842000	4846000	And so I'm kinda glad that, you know, they smacked down the representative.
4846000	4854000	Do I think, you know, I think we live in a day and age where I think there might be some people about this guy that made the remarks that he should be ruined.
4854000	4857000	He's trash. He should get fired and all this stuff.
4857000	4862000	And I'm like, not everything has to be black or white or A or B.
4862000	4865000	I don't think this guy needs to get fired or anything like that.
4865000	4873000	But I do think, which seems to be the case what he's doing, he's taking his licks and he needs to take this moment to go, maybe I should watch my mouth.
4873000	4883000	I will say on a personal level, it would make me really reluctant to want to be around this person or pay any more attention to what they do.
4883000	4893000	Because you now know that when that thought comes out in a moment of not thinking, right, that's what's inside them.
4893000	4899000	That is how that person is. And yes, maybe they are garbage inside, you know.
4899000	4902000	We have a lot of garbage in public places.
4902000	4903000	Sure.
4903000	4918000	You know, and yes, he could be a complete garbage human being, but he should still be treated as fairly as anybody else who let something out or makes a mistake.
4918000	4923000	You know, I especially will, you know, with what's going on in Hollywood right now.
4923000	4926000	Yeah, I've called out a lot of people saying they're garbage.
4926000	4931000	And when their reputation is part of their business, then, yeah, ruin them.
4931000	4933000	That's perfectly fine. That's their personal business.
4933000	4945000	There's a difference between somebody like Harvey Weinstein, who has profited off of like disgusting shit repeated over the years, over and over and built a culture.
4945000	4948000	There's a big difference between him and that guy is garbage.
4948000	4952000	There's a difference between him and this guy who says, go suck a dick, you might like it.
4952000	4955000	You know, he said a dumb shit thing.
4955000	4963000	If he recognizes I did a garbage thing and can own up to it, then you know what? Fine. We can all get past it.
4963000	4972000	That's the part that gives me some hope. The fact that he copped to it and is taking his punishment like an adult.
4972000	4980000	You know, people who whine and try to say, oh, I never did it. It didn't happen or deny it or say I don't care.
4980000	4983000	Those people are even bigger pieces of garbage.
4983000	4991000	Now, some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, I've watched entertaining streamers based on that sample alone.
4991000	4995000	That's not someone I'd watch. Then that's kind of where I'm at too.
4995000	5002000	ActDeftInChat says, XQC's gotten in trouble before. Do you remember the guy that got banned for reporting one tricks? It's the same guy.
5002000	5007000	And he got in trouble not for the reports, but for abusing the system and not using it properly.
5007000	5013000	As Joan Hunter-Matt says, there's a huge problem with people taking things too far in the competitive esports gaming community.
5013000	5019000	The fighting game community is a prime example. Things have gotten better, but it spans all esports and we still have a ways to go.
5019000	5024000	I'm kind of glad you pointed that out because that brings me back to some of my thoughts on the Overwatch League as a whole.
5024000	5029000	Because I did watch that first day of matches. And I have to admit, I'm just going to be honest here.
5029000	5035000	But let me finish my thought before you cut me off with your response. Because I know a lot of you are very hardcore in the Overwatch League here.
5035000	5042000	So when I first was watching the Overwatch League, I think I was watching the San Francisco Shock, which is like our local team or whatever you want to say.
5042000	5049000	Was playing, and I don't even remember what team they were playing at this point, but I remember it was the San Francisco Shock or whatever their first match was.
5049000	5054000	I was watching some of that. And I thought the production value of it was really good.
5054000	5063000	I did think the commentators were doing a good job. I thought they made it kind of look like Overwatch as an NFL thing.
5063000	5067000	You were able to see things that you wouldn't necessarily see in the game, like overhead maps.
5067000	5071000	I thought the commentators did a good job talking about strategies and why things looked a certain way.
5071000	5078000	I thought the arena was a really kick-ass setup. And I thought to be there live was probably a pretty exciting thing.
5078000	5082000	All that being said, there were a few things that kind of struck me.
5082000	5093000	And one of them was that I was like, but these guys, the San Francisco Shock, how many of them are actually from San Francisco or actually play in San Francisco?
5093000	5101000	And if I'm to understand, all of these teams are in LA playing at this one arena that they have.
5101000	5106000	So what really separates these teams at the end of the day? They're owners, right?
5106000	5109000	So there's a part of me that's kind of like, well, that's silly.
5109000	5112000	Like, why do they all have these different branding in the city?
5112000	5119000	However, before you all cut me off, like I said, I've come to understand since then that this is like the goal.
5119000	5123000	Blizzard wants to be there next year or the year after.
5123000	5128000	So maybe this having it all in kind of one place is kind of like the first step.
5128000	5133000	And then maybe in 2019, we'll see home and away games and things of that nature.
5133000	5135000	So I can accept that. You know what?
5135000	5139000	As a league that's got to grow and got to kind of prove its success to its investors.
5139000	5141000	Okay, you know what? Fine.
5141000	5147000	You know, if that Blizzard arena that they have is going to be a template for other things, then cool.
5147000	5150000	But here's the thing I'm not convinced on yet with Overwatch League.
5150000	5160000	And it goes back to when they first rolled out that commercial at BlizzCon last year.
5160000	5164000	I think it was 2016, actually. It would have been 2016 because it took a little while for the league to get going.
5164000	5169000	And I remember the commercial was like, you know, it was showing this faceless name.
5169000	5174000	And it was like, you train hard. You skill up. You do good. You get hired by a league.
5174000	5177000	You get a salary. You do this. You do that. No, no.
5177000	5181000	And it kind of had that feeling of like, you can do this.
5181000	5186000	If you are a good enough Overwatch player, you too could be a part of the Overwatch League.
5187000	5195000	And so, to my surprise, when I'm watching all of these teams play, there's something that's kind of missing.
5195000	5202000	Anyone want to guess what it is that isn't really very reflective of our society and all the yous that could be out there playing?
5202000	5208000	Women. There's no women in the Overwatch League.
5208000	5213000	And I'm sorry, that's a problem. That's a big problem.
5213000	5219000	And look, here's the thing. I've heard all this shit.
5219000	5226000	I'm aware of the Kotaku article about the Korean lady that does a really good Zarya.
5226000	5232000	My understanding is she doesn't really want to be editorialized as somebody in this whole context or whatever.
5232000	5237000	But why isn't she on a team? She's a really good Overwatch player.
5237000	5243000	And the teams are coming out with, oh, but the co-ed housing. Oh, but they might date.
5243000	5248000	Oh, but it just isn't the right moment type of thing.
5248000	5256000	I'm going to quote the great, astounding, and wonderful philosopher of our time, RuPaul Charles.
5256000	5262000	I'm going to quote RuPaul from Season 7, Episode 3 of RuPaul's Drag Race.
5262000	5266000	I don't want to hear any more goddamn excuses. Anymore.
5266000	5270000	Where are the fucking women?
5270000	5281000	It's that simple. Like, you mean to tell me out of 133 people or something that are playing in this league, there wasn't one woman?
5281000	5286000	And I'm sorry, but it's not, I don't want a fucking token either.
5286000	5296000	Like, out of 133 players, there should be, I mean, if it were to really accurately reflect our society, it should be like half, right?
5296000	5304000	But fuck, I think many of us would be happy if there were like 13. 13 women. 10%. Let's start there. Is that too much to ask?
5304000	5309000	You mean to tell me out of all the great players in the world, you can't find 10% that are women?
5309000	5319000	I think we need to ask ourselves, if we want to be taking ourselves seriously, we need to ask ourselves, why aren't women getting committed to Overwatch?
5319000	5324000	Could it be because of behavior like what we just discussed here a minute ago?
5324000	5335000	I'd say that's a likely reason, but honestly, when we're still dealing with a patriarchal society, you know, this is just another symptom of the disease.
5336000	5342000	I'm sorry, patriarchy is a disease. And it is ruining everything until we dismantle it.
5342000	5351000	So whereas I will give Overwatch props for setting this precedent and what they're gonna do, you know, with taking action on this negativity,
5351000	5357000	and maybe that will make the Overwatch League feel more welcoming and maybe more people will train in all this stuff.
5357000	5363000	Miss me with this fucking co-ed, they're gonna date shit. That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
5363000	5365000	I'm sorry, I've never dated a co-worker.
5365000	5374000	And some people have and it's fine, but I don't want to hear any fucking excuses. Not interested in them.
5374000	5385000	So until the Overwatch League can more accurately reflect what they promised in the beginning, you, I'm not so sure I can get as excited about it.
5385000	5391000	But you know what? The minute the League starts to correct some of these things, I'll be the first one to put on a jersey.
5391000	5397000	I do, I do wish them well. I hope they can get there. I feel like if anything can do it, this might be able to do it.
5397000	5402000	But this is a problem that they're gonna have to solve before they can get there.
5402000	5404000	And that's my opinion.
5404000	5406000	No argument for me.
5406000	5413000	Over at chat, I haven't even looked at chat. Over at live.vog and network.com, let's see.
5413000	5418000	SSG100Matt says, I know women who play Overwatch and they do get harassed mercifully.
5418000	5424000	If I was being harassed for my gender, et cetera, why would I play and be a part of that community? To me, that's not fun.
5424000	5427000	Let's see.
5427000	5434000	BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, I dated a co-worker, but it was in college and we both happened to work at the same dorm front desk.
5434000	5442000	ActDeft in chat says, I actually do understand where the League and the teams are coming from, especially since this does happen on regular sports.
5442000	5445000	It's not about gender norms. It's about performance.
5445000	5447000	Look, I know we have-
5447000	5449000	I hear excuse.
5449000	5453000	I know. Respectfully, ActDeft, I hear excuse.
5453000	5455000	And my point is-
5455000	5457000	It's the same excuse men have been saying for an age.
5457000	5466000	If we want to really take this further, we have to get past the normal because the normal doesn't work in this context.
5466000	5468000	Does that make sense? I hope.
5468000	5471000	And on top of that, that doesn't even apply.
5472000	5474000	Well, and here's my thought too.
5474000	5479000	Okay, we have one out gay player in the League. Cool. You know what? That's awesome.
5479000	5487000	And I applaud that guy for being out and, you know, just doing his thing and just being a gay Overwatch player who's really awesome.
5487000	5493000	That's great, but I would doubt he's the only one who's actually gay.
5493000	5498000	So, there's probably Overwatch players who are already dating.
5498000	5501000	Just like, there's probably NFL players who are dating.
5501000	5504000	And there's NBA players who are dating.
5504000	5506000	But they're not out with it. Why?
5506000	5511000	Because we as a society haven't figured out how to handle that appropriately yet.
5511000	5525000	And unfortunately, people are afraid that if such and such NFL player comes out as gay and in a relationship or whatever, it's going to be lost dollars from homophobes who purchase jerseys.
5525000	5527000	Here's the other thing too.
5527000	5538000	In a case of something that's typically male dominated, and I may be off base, but I was not too long ago looking up numbers about this.
5538000	5545000	A gay man is going to be more accepted than a woman. At all. In a male dominated field.
5545000	5547000	That's just how it is.
5547000	5563000	And so, I think that there's still going to be those struggles, but at the end of the day, it's another guy who is going to still fall into, I've got male privilege on my side.
5563000	5567000	And the women are going to be overlooked. That's just how it is.
5567000	5574000	You know, we're talking a lot about women, but I'm sure there's a lot Overwatch League can do racially as well.
5574000	5575000	Indeed.
5575000	5580000	I want to make sure this is very clear. This isn't about ticking boxes or things like that.
5580000	5582000	Tokenism is never the answer.
5582000	5588000	Bingo. This is about, you have to ask yourself, why aren't more women getting involved in sports?
5588000	5593000	Or why aren't these other, you know, this more global community getting more involved with it?
5593000	5595000	You have to answer those questions.
5595000	5605000	And then once you answer those questions, which I kind of think SSJ gave you a big hint there earlier when he was talking about how, you know, women that play Overwatch tend to get treated like shit type of thing.
5605000	5610000	Once you can kind of get that, then the rest of that's going to fall into place.
5610000	5615000	You know what we should do? We need an all female league.
5615000	5617000	I don't think that's the answer.
5617000	5618000	Lear me out.
5618000	5620000	Okay. Fair enough. Go ahead.
5620000	5624000	Where, you know, and by female, I am being trans inclusive.
5624000	5625000	Sure.
5625000	5638000	If you are, if you identify as a woman, this is for you and have all male voices silenced in it just for like a year and watch them perform well and watch them do great.
5638000	5641000	And I think that that right. And then make the offer.
5641000	5644000	Shall we combine?
5644000	5649000	There was a pretty good piece out there that was kind of against the idea of the separate female league.
5649000	5660000	And I kind of tend to agree with it because this is just something where it just needs to happen, where it's all in one and computer games should not be limited by, you know, gender one way or the other.
5660000	5667000	I mean, that's just I totally I get I get what you're saying, Jamie, from a whole like make them feel what we feel type of standpoint.
5667000	5672000	And to be fair to Overwatch League, I haven't put this out there yet, and I really should.
5672000	5675000	I do notice there's women on the stage supporting.
5675000	5678000	I think they have women commentators.
5678000	5680000	I didn't hear one and what I was tokenism.
5680000	5682000	OK, that's just a token effort.
5682000	5684000	It's to appease people.
5684000	5689000	You know, there is and this is a slight sidetrack, but it has to do with this.
5689000	5695000	There's a book that I'm reading right now called Man Made Language by an Australian scholar named Dale Spender.
5695000	5696000	She's intelligent.
5696000	5699000	It's a college thesis is what it reads like.
5699000	5708000	But she goes into during the suffrage movement, how the women had a big conference and men were invited.
5708000	5711000	But the moment a man tried to say something, he was silenced.
5711000	5716000	He was not allowed to have a platform in a women dominated area.
5716000	5726000	And that right there, I mean, maybe it's a little bit of spitefulness, but I would love for these guys to have to know what it's like, you know, to have.
5726000	5728000	Sorry, somebody kept their Google open.
5728000	5729000	Sorry, guys.
5729000	5739000	To have people who are used to getting their words heard and their deeds acknowledged in a position of total silence.
5739000	5740000	That's because that's honestly enough.
5740000	5745000	What a lot of being a woman is like in modern society, even with our advancements.
5745000	5755000	And so that was where I'm coming from with having something that is all matriarchal, have something that a man has no part of.
5755000	5765000	And, you know, let them see what it's like to be disincluded and to not have their voice heard and to also have their asses handed to them by a bunch of girls.
5765000	5766000	Just saying.
5766000	5770000	So anyway, this is a very complex issue that I don't think we're going to be able to solve tonight here on OLR.
5770000	5774000	But I just want to reiterate, I don't like I'm not rooting against the Overwatch League.
5774000	5777000	I don't like I'm not saying kill it with fire or any of this stuff.
5777000	5784000	I'm just expressing disappointment because I was hoping if anyone was going to be able to do better, it was going to be Blizzard.
5784000	5788000	And, you know, this is a problem that doesn't just affect Overwatch.
5788000	5790000	This is a problem throughout esports.
5790000	5794000	I was just hoping that maybe this time we would do it differently.
5794000	5797000	And you know what? There's still time.
5797000	5801000	But in order to get there, guys, no more excuses.
5801000	5803000	That's all I'm saying.
5803000	5805000	Honestly.
5805000	5808000	Like Tim Gunn, my other gospel says, make it work.
5811000	5812000	All right.
5812000	5813000	All right.
5813000	5815000	By the way, that book I'm reading is amazing.
5815000	5817000	It really is amazing.
5817000	5820000	Sounds like a fucked up episode of Black Mirror that I'd be really into.
5820000	5821000	Well.
5821000	5823000	Although that's more technology to be fair.
5823000	5827000	It's definitely page of text kind of book.
5827000	5837000	But it really does point out just how much of our everyday language has been co-opted to be more positive toward men and less positive toward women.
5837000	5843000	And how that just even as a fabric of humanity makes its way into every facet.
5843000	5846000	And I would say even included in games.
5846000	5847000	Yeah.
5847000	5852000	You know, and I'm not saying you have to like fire all these dudes to replace him.
5852000	5853000	No, fire him.
5853000	5855000	Maybe the one if he doesn't shape up.
5855000	5858000	But I'm not saying you have to like fire all these dudes to make room for women.
5858000	5863000	If the Overwatch League is to be successful, maybe they're going to grow into 20 teams.
5863000	5865000	That would be great.
5865000	5870000	But just make sure you're, you know, doing a little more inclusiveness on the expansion teams.
5870000	5873000	We need Team Estrogen.
5873000	5874000	Yeah.
5874000	5878000	That's usually when most people are asking for inclusiveness and so forth.
5878000	5881000	It's not necessarily about taking away from what's always there.
5881000	5882000	What's already there.
5882000	5884000	But like adding to it.
5884000	5887000	I want Team Unicorn Fart.
5887000	5890000	What city would they be from?
5890000	5895000	Team Unicorn Fart should be a bunch of...
5895000	5899000	It should be made half of gay men and their hags.
5902000	5904000	I believe the preferred term now is flame dame.
5904000	5906000	I'm still a hag girl.
5906000	5907000	That's fine.
5907000	5912000	And so instead of hearing, you know, over the PA, you know,
5912000	5914000	Oh, go suck a dick or whatever you'll hear.
5914000	5916000	Goldo!
5917000	5918000	That's what I want.
5918000	5920000	That'd be my team.
5920000	5921000	Awesome.
5921000	5922000	All right.
5922000	5924000	Let's take a trip back down memory lane.
5924000	5926000	Let's go back to...
5926000	5927000	I'd rather not.
5927000	5928000	This is terrible.
5928000	5929000	All right.
5929000	5933000	Well, every week, Dark Soccer climbs into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
5933000	5936000	Hey, you guys should check this game out this week.
5936000	5938000	But, plot twist.
5938000	5943000	In 2017, once a month, we brought you the classic system of the month.
5943000	5948000	And as promised in 2018, we're going to bring you the classic peripheral of the month.
5948000	5952000	So once a month, Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a gaming peripheral
5952000	5954000	that is worthy of your attention.
5954000	5956000	I'd like people to guess what I picked.
5956000	5960000	Well, since we don't get music, you see, usually we play music from the game.
5960000	5961000	I tried to find you a commercial.
5961000	5962000	I do have a commercial.
5962000	5968000	So let's cut to commercial for this week's classic peripheral of the month.
5969000	5973000	You, you, you force.
5973000	5975000	It's so terrible.
5975000	5977000	It's a little quiet too.
5977000	5980000	You, you force.
5980000	5982000	So 84.
5982000	5983000	I know, I love that.
5983000	5984000	This is my jam this song here.
5984000	5986000	Well, it's the you force.
5986000	5987000	Yes.
5987000	5991000	So it's a game controller that we made by Broderbund.
5991000	5993000	You know, they...
5993000	5995000	Published the guardian legend, which was their biggest contribution to gaming.
5995000	5996000	Yes.
5996000	5997000	Yes.
5997000	5999000	And did they also publish Maniac Mansion?
5999000	6005000	I don't remember, but I also remember Broderbund was the people that put out the print shop.
6005000	6006000	That's right.
6006000	6007000	On Apple and Commodore.
6007000	6008000	I was their other big...
6008000	6009000	Load Runner was the other big one.
6009000	6010000	Yeah.
6010000	6017000	But they, they brought out the you force for the NES, which was basically had a couple
6017000	6023000	of IR sensor panels to translate your movements into controller signals.
6023000	6024000	And...
6024000	6029000	I'll just read a little bit from their print blurb.
6029000	6033000	It's like, introducing you force, the revolutionary controller for your Nintendo Entertainment
6033000	6034000	System.
6034000	6036000	So hot no one can touch it.
6036000	6039000	Skip, skip, skip, skip.
6039000	6042000	There's nothing to hold, nothing to jump on, nothing to wear.
6042000	6043000	Oh baby.
6043000	6048000	You force creates a power field that responds to your every command, making you the controller.
6048000	6049000	Skip, skip, skip.
6049000	6052000	Now nothing comes between you and the game.
6052000	6055500	Well, it was shit.
6055500	6064680	You could have a little pilot yoke that would go in the middle of it, but it was really
6064680	6067960	on the level of bad that the power glove was bad.
6067960	6070180	It didn't control anything very well.
6070180	6079560	It was a neat concept, but, you know, IR technology today is a bunch better than how it was then.
6079560	6084160	And we kind of have that now with, you know, more modern peripherals.
6084160	6089560	But you know, I'd say it was pretty ambitious for what it was back in the day.
6089560	6096240	But if I am right, IGN ranked it as like one of the worst, like number 8 of the top 10
6096240	6098680	worst peripherals.
6098680	6099680	It was pretty bad.
6099680	6108800	I think that it was only like second to the Sega activator, which I have an activator
6108800	6113520	and it was pretty bad.
6113520	6124120	This one quote that's great comes from a writer for MSN that says, don't touch said the adverts
6124120	6129440	for the device in a rare example of advertising campaign that got it spot on.
6129440	6133800	So yeah, the force, it was pretty terra bad.
6133800	6137960	So that's your, I'm starting off with one sucky peripheral.
6137960	6142160	Maybe next month I'll do one that didn't sell class or I'll just go for ultra second
6142160	6143280	do the activator.
6143280	6144280	Who knows?
6144280	6146720	You know, it was still an important peripheral.
6146720	6149960	I think a lot of us remember it from being younger and not always for the best read.
6149960	6153160	I think it was one of those things where it sure looked a lot better in the ads than it
6153160	6154520	actually performed.
6154520	6155520	It looks neat.
6155520	6156520	Yeah.
6156520	6162640	You know, I did, I didn't have too many of the third party peripherals back from my Nintendo.
6162640	6164640	I'll tell you what I did have.
6164640	6166720	No, actually it wasn't even third party.
6166720	6172400	I think I had the NES max that had the little switch over that so you could hold the buttons
6172400	6173400	down.
6173400	6174400	That thing was cool.
6174400	6175400	All right.
6175400	6176400	There it is.
6176400	6180880	Your classic peripheral of the month, the U force, you know, classic that word can be
6180880	6181880	taken many ways.
6181880	6182880	All right.
6182880	6183880	We're going to take a break.
6183880	6186640	When we come back, we have plenty more orange launch radio to come, including your emails
6186640	6187640	question Mark.
6187640	6188640	I think we have some emails.
6188640	6191320	Uh, we'll also talk about, Ooh, PlayStation figures.
6191320	6195000	Is this the answer to amiibo or maybe not so much.
6195000	6206240	We'll talk about that when we come back with more of orange launch radio, right after this.
6206240	6211240	Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight, episode number 715 already in
6211240	6217120	progress for this January, the 21st of 2018, we've had a really great show so far.
6217120	6219800	We've kind of covered a lot of bases and what's going on in the gaming world.
6219800	6223120	And we got to talk to Mel B about DDR and freestyle earlier in the show.
6223120	6227080	So I hope you all got to catch that interview, but if not, there's always the podcast because
6227080	6230480	not only is it a live show, it's a podcast and I know many of you listened to it that
6230480	6231480	way.
6231480	6232480	So thanks.
6232480	6233480	I think we just had an OLR first.
6233480	6234480	What's that?
6234480	6238920	Where, um, we had Mormons come to witness to us during the show.
6238920	6239920	Yeah.
6239920	6240920	Right.
6240920	6241920	They, they picked a good time to come by, I guess, right.
6241920	6245320	The halfway point of the show, but uh, yeah, we were just, OLR studios was just visited.
6245320	6248880	We should have brought them in and had them on the show.
6248880	6250360	What kind of video games do you guys play?
6250360	6251720	No, it's yeah.
6251720	6255560	They were looking, they were looking for somebody now Alan and I have lived in this house for
6255560	6256560	almost four years.
6256560	6260560	I think it's coming up on four years in April and they were looking for the person I'm assuming
6260560	6264040	assuming lived here before us cause we were getting mail for them for a long time.
6264040	6265040	So yeah.
6265040	6268120	Why does this cow want to eat fish?
6268120	6269520	Do cows eat fish?
6269520	6271200	Oh, is this animal crossing?
6271200	6272200	Yes.
6272200	6273200	Oh good Lord.
6273200	6274200	All right.
6274200	6277600	We need to get into some rapid fire news though, but a big hello again to those of you in chat
6277600	6283720	over at live.vognetwork.com and uh, are we having to compete against any TV?
6283720	6285040	Do you know what that Google message was?
6285040	6286780	I got, do you remember my Google went off?
6286780	6289240	I think it was while Jamie was saying something earlier.
6289240	6292600	It was Shane messaging me, OMG Star Trek.
6292600	6295180	So I guess something must have happened on that tonight.
6295180	6298400	Tell Shane OMG he needs to get that thing from my house.
6298400	6302360	All right, Shane, do you hear me?
6302360	6304960	I don't think he listens to this show.
6304960	6305960	He's too busy watching Star Trek.
6305960	6309240	You better be listening and come get that thing from my house.
6309240	6311080	All right.
6311080	6315400	To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com
6315400	6317200	use the pass phrase house.
6317200	6319840	Uh, let's get into some rapid fire news.
6319840	6321520	Come get the news from y'all.
6321520	6324960	Oh, Bobby Blackwell says the Screen Actors Guilds awards are tonight.
6324960	6325960	Yeah, who cares?
6325960	6328480	There's so many fucking award shows.
6328480	6332520	Like just God, every Sunday there's some damn award.
6332520	6333520	Anyway.
6334080	6340720	At any rate, um, you, you know, I, I've finally watched the Castlevania series on Netflix.
6340720	6341720	Did you watch it?
6341720	6342720	Rob?
6342720	6343720	I never did.
6343720	6346760	I know it's good.
6346760	6348280	It's really freaking good.
6348280	6354760	Well, thankfully a lot of other people agreed that it was really freaking good because um,
6354760	6358920	now it's been picked up for another eight episodes to come out this summer.
6359720	6364960	And Warren Ellis of course is going to be our writer extraordinaire.
6364960	6370360	So that makes me super happy because Castlevania was really fucking good.
6370360	6379600	And then, um, other news too is that, um, there is apparently going to be another Master
6379600	6381600	System game released.
6381600	6387920	Um, well, you know, we've got the, uh, I know that some of the games have been, you know,
6387920	6393400	re-released like Wonder Boy and Monsterland, but there's a game called Silver Valley that's
6393400	6398440	to be coming out for the Master System, which actually, as I understand it, I think the
6398440	6401040	Master System is still very big in Brazil.
6401040	6404640	So who knows, but it looks.
6404640	6406400	And it's still big in our hearts.
6406400	6407440	That's the other important thing.
6407440	6409880	It looks kind of Castlevania-ish.
6409880	6413180	I'm just, yeah, it's very Castlevania-ish.
6413180	6420380	You know, the same platforming and traps and, you know, uh, skeletons and whatnot all over
6420380	6421380	the place.
6421380	6423580	So not bad.
6423580	6428820	Uh, and some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com yelling at me for not having watched Castlevania
6428820	6429820	yet.
6429820	6431820	Bobby Blackpool says, it's less than two hours.
6431820	6432940	Even I watched Castlevania.
6432940	6435180	S.J. 100 Matt says it's good.
6435180	6437100	Only downside is it's far too short.
6437100	6439780	Rock Cat says Castlevania was good on Netflix.
6439780	6441660	I just need to take the time to watch.
6441660	6443140	I don't watch movies anymore either.
6443140	6444140	It seems.
6444140	6445140	I don't watch Star Trek.
6445140	6446140	I don't really.
6446140	6449580	Well, you know, my thing right now is watching everything on YouTube, except I did start
6449580	6453280	a Japanese drama that came out in 2014 called Masan.
6453280	6458980	And it's about a Japanese man who goes to Scotland to study how to make whiskey.
6458980	6465460	And you know, like, just in, you know, they've only been dethroned a few years ago, but Japanese
6465460	6468900	whiskey makers scored top in the world.
6468900	6475820	And so, but he brings back his Scottish wife in, you know, 1930s Japan.
6475820	6480180	And so it's about their relationship and, you know, his goal to make whiskey in Japan.
6480180	6486820	But that's like big history nerd thing took off, but I want them to I want to do a drama
6486820	6487820	just about gamers.
6487820	6490100	They did a drama about gyaru.
6490100	6491980	Why can't they do one about gamers?
6491980	6494020	Lord knows there's lots of drama on the gaming community.
6494020	6495020	Right.
6495020	6496020	All right.
6496020	6497020	I have more news.
6497020	6500320	I have a couple of things on Final Fantasy, including and this is one of those websites
6500320	6503060	where for whatever reason, it doesn't load right on my computer.
6503060	6508380	But I think I remember the details of this Final Fantasy 15, the royal edition was confirmed.
6508380	6509620	It's going to be coming out on March 6th.
6509620	6511780	I think we talked about this as a rumor last week.
6511780	6514780	Well, it turns out that it is happening and there's going to be a Windows edition that
6514780	6515940	happens with it as well.
6515940	6519160	So you get to get Final Fantasy 15 for the first time on PC.
6519160	6523340	Not only does it come with all the existing DLC, but they're adding even more to it.
6523340	6525820	I know they were talking about a new dungeon was in it as well.
6525820	6530340	So some people are getting a little irritated that like they won't stop adding to Final
6530340	6534540	Fantasy 15, especially for a story that's a little more narrative than something like
6534540	6538140	an MMO, which leads me to Final Fantasy 14.
6538140	6543860	Final Fantasy 14 is getting a patch coming out and it's patch 4.2 for Stormblood.
6543860	6547020	The Rise of a New Sun that's coming out on January 30th.
6547020	6551380	And perhaps what's most interesting about Rise of a New Sun is that the new raid dungeon
6551380	6558580	Omega Sigmascape will feature bosses from Final Fantasy 6.
6558580	6562420	In fact, in the trailer, good old Doom Train makes an appearance there.
6562420	6565420	And so it looks like the first fight you'll be doing is against the Doom Train or the
6565420	6566420	Phantom Train.
6566420	6567700	Can you suplex it?
6567700	6572080	I hope so, but no word if you get to suplex the train or not.
6572080	6576620	But at the very, very, very end of the trailer, there's a shot of Kefka.
6576620	6579800	So it's assumed with that laugh even.
6579800	6583200	So it's assumed that you will actually fight Kefka at the end of this.
6583200	6584200	So it's pretty cool.
6584200	6588440	I did the last raid because Omega Deltascape was kind of out.
6588440	6589560	I think it was out with the expansion.
6589560	6590560	It was 4.1.
6590560	6591680	I don't remember.
6591680	6595680	But in that one, you fought a bunch of Final Fantasy 5 bosses.
6595680	6596780	And so that was pretty cool.
6596780	6602140	But you know, since 5 wasn't released here in the US originally, I don't remember it
6602140	6604440	as well as I remember 4 and 6.
6604440	6608120	So I'm thinking we're getting the 6 bosses here and maybe we're going to get Final Fantasy
6608120	6610320	4 bosses in the last raid or something.
6610320	6611400	We'll see.
6611400	6621040	By the way, just from chat, ActDeft did bring up that we should watch The Shape of Water,
6621040	6622040	which I did see.
6622040	6623040	I was going to say, you did see that, didn't you?
6623040	6624120	I did see that.
6624120	6629720	And honestly enough, it's playing now over at Arden Fermol.
6629720	6631500	I want to take you to see that.
6631500	6632500	Is that good, huh?
6632500	6633500	It's that good.
6633500	6639820	I think that there's one of the characters in it that I think that you would just find
6639820	6643200	completely heartbreaking and adore him.
6643200	6644200	There's so many movies.
6644200	6649000	I still need to see Lady Bird, which everyone in this town is talking about.
6649000	6651980	And I never saw Get Out.
6651980	6652980	I have it.
6652980	6655900	I'm thinking of the movies that are going to get nominated for Oscars this year.
6655900	6657740	And I never did see Get Out.
6657740	6659020	I just didn't get around to it.
6659020	6661940	I picked it up on Blu-ray if you want to come watch it at my house.
6661940	6662940	Oh, okay.
6663380	6667920	I went to see it at the reclining theaters.
6667920	6671540	It was seriously next to Star Wars, the best movie I had seen.
6671540	6673940	I still haven't seen Star Wars.
6673940	6676480	The last movie I saw in theaters was the Power Ranger movie.
6676480	6678300	Was that even this year or 2017?
6678300	6683620	I saw The Shape of Water this year because I went to see it right after my surgery.
6683620	6687320	And I have to say, actually, yeah, it was this year.
6687320	6690020	But I cried halfway through the movie.
6690020	6691900	I cried at the end of the movie.
6691900	6693540	It was kind of ugly.
6693540	6701460	My mascara is a little too expensive to go see movies like that.
6701460	6706680	But I think that you and I should see it before I go back to work.
6706680	6707880	I'm that serious about it.
6707880	6709500	I will pay for you to see it.
6709500	6710500	Well shucks.
6710500	6712660	Who am I to say no to free?
6712660	6713660	So we'll work it out.
6713660	6714660	All right.
6714660	6716980	Well, for now, we got to travel around the world and check out some release dates.
6716980	6720380	And Loki's not here, but I will do my best to make up for...
6720380	6722820	Oh, I thought I was going to do it because I'd already pulled it up.
6722820	6723820	Oh, well then go ahead.
6723820	6726820	Unless you want me to do the Japanese ones.
6726820	6727820	Let's try that.
6727820	6728820	Why don't you do the Japanese ones?
6728820	6731780	Okay, then go ahead and do the American ones and I'll get it to load.
6731780	6733300	The Japanese list can be a little funky.
6733300	6735260	You have to jump from system to system.
6735260	6736820	It's not all in one place.
6736820	6737820	All right.
6737820	6742140	So I will start with the US ones and it's reverse night here at OLR.
6742140	6748020	Coming out on the 23rd is Iconoclasts for Windows, Mac, PS4, and PS Vita.
6748020	6750220	Who knew the PS Vita was still getting releases here?
6750220	6753780	The Inpatient is a PS VR game that you'll see on the 23rd.
6753780	6756460	Lost Sphere, I think I know some people looking forward to that.
6756460	6760540	That's on Windows and the Nintendo Switch as well as PlayStation 4 and Subnautica for
6760540	6761540	Windows and Mac.
6761540	6768140	A little later, kind of off the regular release, 23rd, we have on the 25th, Celeste on Windows,
6768140	6769860	Switch, and PlayStation 4.
6769860	6775480	We have Dragon Ball FighterZ, or Fighters, coming out for Windows, PS4, and Xbox One.
6775480	6776740	That is on the 26th.
6776740	6781900	Lastly, Monster Hunter World on the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One.
6781900	6783980	So Jamie's going to give the Japanese releases a go.
6783980	6784980	I'm excited to hear this.
6784980	6789460	I have found an alternate list, but it's not listing the exact dates on it.
6789460	6790820	So let's go back over here.
6790820	6791820	Okay.
6791820	6792820	All right.
6792820	6794100	So you just pick a system and read what's on it.
6794100	6795100	Well, sort of.
6795100	6797220	You have to be careful because it mixes in stuff from other countries.
6797220	6800420	So the first one is that Nanatsu, if you see that.
6801420	6806940	Yeah, Nanatsu no Taizai, Britannia no Tabibito.
6806940	6810180	And that is coming out on PlayStation 4.
6810180	6819380	We have Fighting Edge Blade for PS4 and PC, Ninkiseyuu no Tsukurikata on, yeah, PS4.
6819380	6821700	And there's a limited edition coming out.
6821700	6827660	And we have Axiom Verge, multiverse edition, that's, yeah, Monster Hunter World, Dragon
6827660	6831380	Ball Fighter Z on the 26th.
6831380	6836300	We also have, let me scooch on down a bit.
6836300	6837620	I think that's it for that system.
6837620	6838620	That's it.
6838620	6839620	Yeah.
6839620	6840620	How am I doing, Rob?
6840620	6841620	So far so good.
6841620	6843140	You just have to be able to, reading this list is a little messy.
6843140	6847620	We also have the PlayStation 4 Monster Hunter World Starter Pack in glacier white and jet
6847620	6848620	black.
6848620	6849620	Nice.
6849620	6851420	So voila.
6851420	6863700	So on Vita, because people still love the Vita there, we have Ninkiseyuu no Tsukurikata,
6863700	6864700	the same one.
6864700	6867860	We have a Nekomimi multigaming headset.
6867860	6871620	You know what the Nekomimi is, right?
6871620	6875980	It's the cat ears that move based on how your emotions are.
6875980	6876980	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6876980	6883140	It doesn't have a date on it, but it says unepic, so whatever that is.
6883140	6885900	And let's go, there's stuff for PS3?
6885900	6886900	Nope.
6886900	6890620	I just find it hilarious that that list is on here.
6890620	6899060	Xbox One, Dragon Ball Fighter Z, and that's it because they don't like the Xbox in Japan.
6899060	6903220	The Monster Hunter World.
6903220	6905620	Let's see what we've got for Switch.
6905620	6908860	Voez on the 25th.
6908860	6917420	We have the multigaming headset coming out later on this month, so not too much.
6917420	6922420	And then, let me see what we have on 3DS.
6922420	6930580	On 3DS we, ooh, the new Nintendo 2DS XL Pikachu edition in Australia.
6930580	6934620	And Radiant Historia, perfect chronology, oh also European.
6934620	6937460	So yeah, not too much, really.
6937460	6940700	So kind of slow.
6940700	6942820	Alright.
6942820	6944580	And let me do Europe too, because I will.
6944580	6945580	Might as well.
6945580	6946580	I wasn't ready for that.
6946580	6947580	Alright.
6947580	6949660	Well, it's kind of fun to switch it up, right?
6949660	6950660	Yeah.
6950660	6956420	On the, what's today, the 21st, okay, on the 23rd we have icon class.
6956420	6959360	The, wait, that's US, what am I doing?
6959360	6962660	Because I had it up to, stupid.
6962700	6964300	I'm all confused, Rob.
6964300	6965660	Okay, on the 26th.
6965660	6967860	Juggling three regions is hard.
6967860	6968860	Yeah.
6968860	6973860	On the 26th we have Dragon Ball FighterZ on PC, PS4, and X-Bone.
6973860	6976140	That's it.
6976140	6981820	Alright, well as if that wasn't enough, it's time to jump into the mailbag.
6981820	6982820	Which is empty.
6982820	6983820	Is it empty tonight?
6983820	6984820	It was spam.
6984820	6985820	Oh, I thought we actually had one tonight.
6985820	6986820	Alright.
6986820	6988380	There was only spam in there, I looked at them both.
6988380	6990720	Well you need to get the spammers out of here, people.
6990720	6991720	Help us out.
6991760	6996800	You can send us emails, participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com if you want to participate, along with
6996800	6997800	the show.
6997800	6998800	Get on it.
6998800	6999800	Alright.
6999800	7003560	In the meantime, let's get back to some other news, and then we'll be taking your phone
7003560	7008080	calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype in just a little while.
7008080	7010080	But first.
7010080	7011640	Of course.
7011640	7017060	PlayStation is doing their own answer, well Sony is doing their own answer to Amiibo,
7017060	7021560	but they're not like Amiibo, they're just collectible figures.
7021560	7027600	It's called, hold on let me get it, it's called Totaku, and some of the figures, there's
7027600	7033400	only one of these that I actually want, I want the Parappa, because I even had Parappa
7033400	7040440	Happy Meal toys from Japan, so, except someone stole it out of my damn car, asshole.
7040440	7047080	But anyway, they are doing Bloodborne's Hunter, Crash Bandicoot, Parappa the Rapper, Kratos
7047080	7052320	from God of War, the Thasar FX-350 Racing Ship from Wipeout, okay that one might be
7052320	7057760	worth it, Sackboy from LittleBigPlanet, and Heihachi from Tekken, they'll all be $9.99,
7057760	7061460	I mean I might want a Heihachi just to, I'd put him on my cubicle wall, and just have
7061460	7065440	him stare at my neighbor Kelby, he'd probably find that hilarious though.
7065440	7068540	Yeah, you know some people are looking at these and going, oh is this Sony's answer
7068540	7072680	to Amiibo, but no, they're not, they're not gonna have little chips in them, they don't
7072680	7073680	interact with the games.
7073680	7074680	The Heihachi figure looks pretty cool.
7074680	7076760	They're just figures, that's all they are.
7076760	7079840	I want a Yoshimitsu though, they should do a Yoshimitsu.
7079840	7081640	If these do well, they'll probably do a series too.
7081640	7082800	I'm gonna get Parappa, Parappa's the one I want.
7082800	7086780	You know why, there's figures coming out, it's not just Amiibo, it's those pop vinyls,
7086780	7090400	my favorite, I always talk about here on this show, those pop vinyls are everywhere.
7090400	7093560	How disturbing is the shirtless, reclining Jeff Goldblum?
7093560	7095320	Oh yeah, that was funny, I like that.
7095320	7098520	That is frightening, I never, I've never found him attractive.
7098520	7101920	Uh, see, and I'm one of those things where I'm like, God, those pop vinyl things are
7101920	7107800	everywhere, but yet, I still really want the Trixie Mattel and the Alaska and the RuPaul,
7107800	7109760	the Drag Race series they just put out.
7109760	7115680	Did you know that there are other of those cardboard toys that are already out on the
7115680	7116680	market?
7116680	7117680	Labo, or?
7117680	7127260	Kinda like Labo, but they're more for stem, like there's one called Makey Makey, Little
7127260	7134060	Bits Droid Inventor Kit, Bloxels, Anki Overdrive, just listing some of them, and this one does
7134060	7138040	use kind of wood and circuit boards called Piper and Kano.
7138040	7140460	But do any of them interface with games?
7140460	7141460	That's gonna be what separates?
7141460	7144220	There's robot making ones, so, I mean, pretty cool stuff.
7144220	7147220	I still think Labo's gonna kinda be in a category of its own, you know?
7147220	7148220	Well, cause it's Nintendo.
7148220	7149220	Of course!
7149220	7150220	Nintendo Special.
7150220	7151220	Of course!
7151220	7152220	Absolutely.
7152220	7156260	Alright, so you might get some of those Totaku figures.
7156260	7159180	I might.
7159180	7160180	I might too, we'll see.
7160180	7163700	I want Parappa, really, cause I just, I like Parappa.
7163700	7167340	So we know that one of the big, big games out there in the world, we don't talk about
7167340	7171140	it a lot here on OLR, cause I just don't think any of us really play it, but I know a lot
7171140	7173500	of people do, and that's the FIFA series.
7173500	7176380	Specifically, this story is about FIFA 18.
7176380	7180980	You would expect that this game is sold a lot and a lot on Playstation 4 and Xbox One,
7180980	7185380	and of course it has, at least here in the States, but in Japan, interesting, because
7185380	7190220	some numbers have just come out about the sales of FIFA 18, and it turns out the Playstation
7190220	7196980	4 version of FIFA sold 77,000 copies, about, I'm rounding here, the Switch version sold
7196980	7200300	89,000 copies.
7200300	7206020	So in Japan, the Nintendo Switch version of FIFA 18 did better than the Playstation 4
7206020	7210540	version, you know, so is this gonna make EA pay a little more attention to the Switch?
7210540	7211540	Eh, we'll see.
7211540	7216380	I bet those sales numbers still, I think they'll probably get a lot bigger here in the States
7216380	7220380	and especially, maybe not so much the States, but especially Europe, I'm sure those numbers
7220380	7226140	look a lot different, but still, you can't help but notice, it's selling on the Switch
7226140	7229100	more than it is on the Playstation 4, at least in Japan.
7229100	7233060	So it's, I guess, a testament to how popular the Nintendo Switch is right now.
7233060	7234060	True that.
7234060	7238420	Dungeon Buster points out a really good fact about this, the Switch is also mobile, and
7238420	7243380	Japan has a huge mobile market, oh heck yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's lots of people even
7243380	7246740	here that are like, hmm, I might pick that up on the Switch, because that would be good
7246740	7249100	to have that on the go as well as on the TV.
7249100	7253580	Heck, I'm still waiting for that Mega Man collection, no, I'm sorry, the Disney, I mean,
7253580	7257140	the Mega Man one will be cool too, and I know that's coming, but the Disney cartoon collection,
7257140	7261260	I'm still waiting for that on Switch, I haven't bought it yet, so I want it where I can take
7261260	7263400	it on the go, and have it on the TV.
7263400	7266580	I want it all.
7266580	7267580	Dark Soccer, what do you have?
7267580	7272360	I want the world, I want the whole world.
7272360	7278020	Super Mario Odyssey has got new outfits coming out, because part of the fun is dressing up
7278020	7279020	Mario.
7279020	7280020	Hooray.
7280020	7286540	There are going to, not only are there going to be more outfits, there's going to be more
7286540	7292500	snapshot mode filters that come through, so this should be some pretty cute fun stuff,
7292500	7298940	if you like dressing up Mario like a cutie patootie, or in a wedding dress.
7298940	7300780	That's really it, there's nothing more exciting about that.
7300780	7304660	I'm glad they're still continuing to kind of develop stuff for Super Mario Odyssey,
7304660	7309620	I'm kind of surprised we don't have new worlds yet, but we'll see, that's probably coming
7309620	7313060	at some point, right?
7313060	7314380	Well at some point.
7314380	7318440	Also for the Switch, Skyrim, you know, that game's been around forever, and it finally
7318440	7323140	made its debut on the Switch late last year, and it turns out, most people figured it was
7323140	7327860	probably just a quick little port of Skyrim over to the Switch, but it turns out some
7327860	7333540	of those infamous bugs in Skyrim were actually fixed on the Nintendo Switch, and not through
7333540	7337200	mods or anything like that, because the Switch version doesn't support mods.
7337200	7343540	But one example that's being cited is that when you approach Brinjolf in the town of
7343540	7348600	Riften about a business opportunity, this is how you join the Thieves Guild.
7348600	7353380	You steal a ring, and you plant it on a merchant, Brinjolf, who gets arrested.
7353380	7358880	Now Brinjolf says that Brinjolf will only be in jail for a few days, but in the other
7358880	7363220	versions of the game, this character ends up being imprisoned for the rest of the game.
7363220	7367040	So what you have to do, you have to drop the ring, and then you can join the guild.
7367040	7371740	But apparently in the Nintendo Switch version, you don't have to do that, Brinjolf does get
7371740	7374200	released a few days into the game.
7374200	7378100	So that got fixed, and some people are just now finding out about that, because obviously
7378100	7381680	Skyrim has a million things you can do in it, and some people are just getting around
7381680	7382680	to that.
7382680	7385280	So it's kind of interesting that some of the bugs in the Switch version of the game were
7385280	7386680	actually fixed.
7386680	7389880	So is the Switch version of the game the definitive version?
7389880	7391280	Well, it's hard to say.
7391280	7394920	I guess it would depend on what's important to you, because if mods are important to you,
7394920	7398400	well, you might want to stick with the PC version, or at least maybe one of the other
7398400	7399400	ones.
7399400	7403820	The most HD graphics, and the most HD-est, if that's a term.
7403820	7404820	It's HD-er.
7404820	7410860	Then maybe the Playstation 4, Xbox One versions, or PC are going to really be up your alley.
7410860	7415300	I don't know, I still think that Skyrim just begs for modding, you know?
7415300	7416300	Oh yeah.
7416300	7419660	I love Skyrim, but I am, and I'm glad it got a Switch release.
7419660	7423340	I know there's people that are excited to have that mobile, but I really am ready for
7423340	7425300	what's next with Elder Scrolls, guys.
7425300	7427820	I want the new job Skyrim job.
7427820	7428820	The new version.
7429240	7431680	Let's get to the next thing in the Elder Scrolls universe.
7431680	7432680	It's time.
7432680	7433680	This is sad.
7433680	7434680	It's time.
7434680	7435680	Sad-facedness.
7435680	7437640	Sorry to give you sad news here towards the end.
7437640	7444640	Well, and he's actually, I mean, an artist that I've looked up to, Bob Wakelin, died.
7444640	7453640	And he did the covers for a lot of NES games, including Contra, which is iconic.
7453640	7456000	Rainbow Islands, New Zealand Story.
7456000	7459020	New Zealand Story is such a fun little game, too.
7459020	7462180	Mr. Nuts on SNES, a whole bunch of others.
7462180	7471620	He also did a lot of artwork for the Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST, and Amiga.
7471620	7476660	And it got him a lot of fame in Europe, and he did a lot of European covers for Midnight
7476660	7482140	Resistance, Batman, Whizball, Head Over Heels, and Hunchback.
7483100	7490460	His work, I mean, really covered a lot of our childhoods, like, I mean, he did Rastan.
7490460	7499340	He did, um, and his artwork was so versatile, because he could do realistic, and then he
7499340	7507900	could do cartoony or parody style artwork, and it was just absolutely amazing.
7507900	7515580	He could do games that clearly needed to be cutesy and a bit more, I'd say, Japanese
7515580	7516580	in appearance.
7516580	7525940	He could do them well, and I am just completely saddened and floored, because he seriously
7525940	7529100	was one of the people that inspired me to get into art.
7529100	7532380	So may your memory be a blessing.
7533340	7539020	Well, not all the news is good, but definitely take a moment to reflect on what he's given,
7539020	7543740	you know, the gaming community through these iconic artworks, advertising games.
7543740	7547420	Even his fantasy art and realistic style, it put him up there with, like, Julie Bell
7547420	7549680	and Boris Vallejo.
7549680	7550680	Really amazing work.
7550680	7555660	Well, lastly here, before we get to the phones, and wow, I didn't realize the second half
7555660	7559660	of the show was gonna fly by compared to the first half, but I also thought we had at least
7559660	7560660	one email.
7560660	7563980	Hopefully we'll get some calls here at Orange Lounge Radio in just a moment, but I have
7563980	7567100	one more thing for you before we get to the phones, and that has to do with something
7567100	7568100	that's been announced.
7568100	7572340	It is a Kickstarter project, so, you know, I always kind of take these with a grain of
7572340	7574740	salt, but it does sound pretty cool.
7574740	7576660	It's something called NES Maker.
7576660	7580640	Now, this sounds really similar to something we had a couple weeks ago, where it was like
7580640	7584740	you were taking all these NES game things, it was kind of like a hodgepodge Mario Maker,
7584740	7587700	but I think that was on, I think that was a little different.
7587740	7594220	NES Maker is actually a program that they're developing, that's available on Kickstarter,
7594220	7598580	where you can actually do sprite graphics and color palettes that are constrained by
7598580	7599900	NES limitations.
7599900	7605500	You create assets to go with the NES, and it's all object-oriented, like Game Maker
7605500	7606500	or Unity.
7606500	7608980	You can use a text editor to do strings for NPCs.
7608980	7613980	You create special screens, like start screens, customize the AI, et cetera, et cetera.
7613980	7617380	Basically this is gonna allow you to create your own NES game without having to learn
7617380	7620180	the actual complicated programming that goes with it.
7620180	7624220	Might be a very good entry way for some people that are kind of like, oh, I want to create
7624220	7625220	a game.
7625220	7628420	This might be something that would help people do that, so, pretty cool.
7628420	7633260	I like though a lot of the Maker programs, I tried to learn my way through RPG Maker
7633260	7634260	for a while.
7634260	7638180	I still want to do something in RPG, I want to do like the OLR adventure.
7638180	7641460	Now Kaijuto in chat says Nintendo gonna shut that shit down.
7641460	7643980	You know, I'm not sure they can.
7643980	7650860	I mean, NES Maker is about, but does Nintendo have NES itself trademarked, or do they have
7650860	7653060	Nintendo Entertainment System trademarked?
7653060	7657860	Because I just don't think, I mean, because they're not using Mario to sell it, they're
7657860	7662620	not using Zelda, so they're not infringing on those sorts of iconic characters to do
7662620	7663620	this.
7663620	7667740	They're just saying, hey, you can make games that look like they're from the Nintendo era.
7667740	7673260	So I'm not sure Nintendo would have much of a case here, or if they'd want one, to be
7673260	7674260	honest.
7674260	7681900	Now the thing that has me curious is if something like this would put out like a NES ROM, so
7681900	7684620	that I could play it on like an EverDrive or something.
7684620	7690540	Oh, now, okay, so Bobby Blackwolf says you can actually compile them to a NES ROM like
7690540	7691540	you're okay.
7691540	7693460	So he's saying that this is something I'm missing.
7693460	7698140	Ah, well, that may be a little trickier with that, but.
7698140	7702940	And then I wonder if it can be compiled into a NES ROM, then can you use it as a ROM editor?
7703820	7706140	Well, here's the thing.
7706140	7711820	Now again, I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know how far down this hole I want to go, but technically
7711820	7715400	emulators are to play homegrown ROMs.
7715400	7718820	You're not supposed to play the actual Super Mario Brothers and stuff.
7718820	7725020	So is there really a legal problem if you make this NES ROM that isn't Mario or Zelda,
7725020	7727220	something of your own creation, and you play it in an emulator?
7727220	7728220	Well, is that wrong?
7728220	7733680	I don't think Nintendo's done anything to shut down the Kaizo Mario games either.
7733680	7740240	And we've had a couple of the Kaizo-type games run at Games Done Quick.
7740240	7742980	And Bobby Blackwolf says Nintendo doesn't shut down homebrew.
7742980	7746380	All this program does is let you create homebrew without learning assembly language.
7746380	7751560	And yeah, in my mind, kind of goes to, well, remember when they fought Tengen and Color
7751560	7755460	Dreams and those other companies that weren't really officially Nintendo licensed that reverse
7755460	7756460	engine the cartridge?
7756460	7757580	They lost that case.
7757580	7764020	At the time too, Nintendo was making money on the system.
7764020	7770560	I mean, to be honest, they're not really making anything on the Nintendo now.
7770560	7778140	So they had a lot more to lose by not having, I would say almost a monopoly on that cartridge
7778140	7780560	format or making the games.
7780560	7782980	They were wanting to filter everything through their control.
7782980	7792680	And now that the NES is no longer a profitable system, other than, of course, the NES Classic
7792680	7797380	and stuff like that, that there's not really too much that I think they should be super
7797380	7798380	worried about it.
7798380	7803500	It would just be the use of IPs that are still something that's bringing in money.
7803500	7807100	I think as long as the games that come out of this are not trying to infringe on the
7807100	7812820	stuff that I'm assuming, at some point Nintendo will want to sell on a Switch Virtual Console,
7812820	7816820	you know, be it Balloon Fight multiplayer across the internet or whatever it is.
7816820	7820020	I just don't think I don't see any problems as long as some of those intellectual things
7820020	7821020	don't get infringed on.
7821020	7822700	You'd think of something better than Balloon Fight.
7822700	7826900	Well, but I just wasn't that in one of the early commercials or something or something?
7826900	7830100	There's a screenshot or something like, we know that one's coming.
7830100	7833580	And plus it could also be the whole Iwata tie-in.
7833580	7836220	That could be why they chose that particular game.
7836220	7837220	You know?
7837220	7838220	So who knows?
7838220	7839220	Possibly.
7839220	7840220	Yeah.
7840220	7843180	I want them to do a collection of games and names.
7843180	7848460	I want them to do the Yokoi collection.
7848460	7857180	Just like a super cartridge of all of the games that were designed or influenced by
7857180	7859060	Gunpei Yokoi.
7859060	7862780	Why do that when you can sell them for five bucks a piece on the Switch?
7862780	7863780	Yeah.
7863780	7864780	I don't know.
7864780	7865780	That's the reality.
7865780	7866780	Wishful thinking.
7866780	7867780	All right.
7867780	7868780	The Skype line is open.
7868780	7871180	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7871180	7875020	If you want to give us a call and we can talk about anything we've discussed so far tonight
7875020	7876640	or something else.
7876640	7878140	Maybe you have something else.
7878140	7880400	Maybe you want to preview your freestyle routine.
7880400	7881400	It's coming up this Saturday.
7881400	7883180	I don't know how to do that with audio only.
7883180	7885540	You can tell us what song.
7885540	7889460	Confirm if you're doing Ariana Grande or something else from DDR Ace.
7889460	7893620	Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7893620	7896900	I'd usually go around and ask if we have any last minute stories, although I'm not sure.
7896900	7897900	I'm not sure you do.
7897900	7898900	Right, Jamie?
7898900	7899900	I think we covered most of the stuff, right?
7899900	7900900	No.
7900900	7901900	I have a story.
7901900	7902900	What?
7902900	7903900	This alligator guy in my game is a bitch.
7903900	7905900	I don't think that has anything to do with games, but we do have the phone.
7905900	7906900	It's a game?
7906900	7907900	Oh.
7907900	7908900	Oh.
7908900	7909900	Oh.
7909900	7910900	The alligator in Animal Crossing.
7910900	7911900	Yeah.
7911900	7912900	Well, hey, we do have the phone lighting up.
7912900	7913900	Hi.
7913900	7914900	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7914900	7915900	Who's this?
7915900	7916900	What's going on, everyone?
7916900	7917900	It's Rama.
7917900	7918900	Hey, Rama.
7918900	7919900	What's on your mind, buddy?
7919900	7920900	Good to hear from you.
7920900	7926140	Besides the fact that my tea is overflowing from the stuff that I missed on Facebook because
7926140	7927580	I went to the movies.
7927580	7928740	Spill it.
7928740	7931820	I'm just like, damn.
7931820	7932820	Facebook drama?
7932820	7936060	It's within the cosplay community and other things.
7936060	7937060	Spill the tea.
7937060	7939060	It's just like, Jesus.
7939060	7941740	My teacup, it runneth over.
7941740	7945300	Just honestly, just log out.
7945300	7947340	That's kind of the point where I'm at with Facebook.
7947340	7953300	Facebook is sharing important life updates and pictures of Mr. Smoosh, and that's about
7953300	7954300	it.
7954300	7955300	I don't need Facebook for anything else right now.
7956020	7959580	But some of the stuff that's going on, I do keep an ear to because it does affect the
7959580	7961660	cosplay community as a whole.
7961660	7967060	So I need to know what's going on with that so I can have my investigative reporters kind
7967060	7968540	of follow the paper trail.
7968540	7974100	Yeah, I guess you do have to be connected for your show.
7974100	7979060	Like well, if you haven't seen our article about Anime Matsuri, yeah.
7979060	7981060	That bullshit.
7981300	7989140	Uchon, I've gotten a lot of anonymous posts in my inbox in regards to what was going on.
7989140	7994260	I sent it to Koi and she dropped her tea when I sent you those screenshots.
7994260	7995260	So yeah.
7995260	7998260	I saw.
7998260	8002260	That is some fetid stuff.
8002260	8006860	Yeah, it's basically why I decided not to go back this year.
8006860	8009860	Yeah, I'm glad I never went.
8010660	8013660	Well, I only went last year just for Sarah Mead.
8013660	8014660	That's it.
8014660	8019660	I understood what was going on, but I felt I knew that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
8019660	8021660	So I'm going to take a stab at it.
8021660	8023660	They're supposed to have like another big announcement.
8023660	8025660	I have a theory of what it is.
8025660	8028660	And if my theory is correct, it's still not enough for me to go.
8028660	8034660	Well, I think that we should not keep people who are in suspense and in the dark.
8034660	8037660	So why don't you spill a little bit of that?
8038460	8043660	Well, my theory is they put it, they made this post and they said Sailor Moon and Hangout
8043660	8044660	Story 2018.
8044660	8050660	My theory is either going to get the entire English dub cast or the current Japanese cast
8050660	8052660	for Sailor Moon Crystal.
8052660	8054660	That's my theory.
8054660	8058660	Well, if you got enough money, you can get almost whatever you want at your convention.
8058660	8061660	I'd be surprised AX isn't pulling something like that instead because they've got the
8061660	8064660	bigger crowd share.
8064660	8066660	Yeah.
8066660	8067660	Yeah.
8067660	8068660	I believe that.
8068660	8071660	Well, now Rama, did you just want to talk about conventions or is there something else
8071660	8072660	on your mind tonight?
8072660	8073660	No, no, no, Rob.
8073660	8077660	I just want to thank you again for making me feel like a nerdy 12 year old.
8077660	8079660	And I mean that in a positive way.
8079660	8080660	Why is that?
8080660	8083660	What did I say that got you feeling like a nerdy 12 year old?
8083660	8086660	Talk about Nintendo Labo and the science for your kids.
8086660	8087660	Oh, yeah.
8087660	8088660	Yeah.
8088660	8089660	Yeah.
8089660	8092660	Oh, those kids I was talking about from like Radio Shack with the springs and the wires
8092660	8093660	and all that.
8093660	8094660	Yes.
8094660	8098660	I was bouncing off the walls when you mentioned that because I could have sworn I called in
8098660	8103660	and spoke about this before, but every summer when I would finish school, I would go to
8103660	8108660	Radio Shack and buy one of the kits and I will play with this kit for the entire summer.
8108660	8111660	And yes, I did the whole little FM radio thing too.
8111660	8113660	I thought that was one of the coolest things ever.
8113660	8114660	Isn't it?
8114660	8115660	Yeah.
8115660	8116660	Those things are rad.
8116660	8119660	Like I learned a lot about science and things from kits like that.
8119660	8123660	So, you know, Labo is in some ways a different form of that.
8123660	8128660	Well, I'm sure those kits still have to exist in some form or another, but I'm sure a lot
8128660	8130660	now is like iPads and shit.
8130660	8131660	No, no, no.
8131660	8136660	I kind of think that the science for kids kind of evolved into those little robotic
8136660	8139660	Raspberry Pi kits you see at Micro Center.
8139660	8140660	Oh, shit.
8140660	8141660	Yeah, probably.
8141660	8146660	That's what it's become, you know, and I missed the presentation about this, but I caught
8146660	8149660	up to it and I'm like cardboard.
8149660	8150660	That's kind of cool.
8150660	8156660	And what bothered me is that there were people complaining about this, saying this is a kid's
8156660	8157660	thing, this is that.
8157660	8160660	And I'm like, Nintendo did say this is for kids.
8160660	8168660	If you are an adult complaining about something for children that the company said is for
8168660	8171660	children, you need to reprioritize your life.
8171660	8172660	Yeah.
8172660	8175660	Nintendo has more than one team that does stuff.
8175660	8183660	And, you know, look, the Wii U had a real problem getting in everybody's home.
8183660	8188660	If this Labo thing is going to help the Switch get in more homes, including homes with kids,
8188660	8193660	that's going to benefit everybody in the long run, because then Nintendo will have more money
8193660	8201660	to develop other stuff like Smash or Metroid Prime 4 or the rumored other new 2D Metroid,
8201660	8205660	which we skipped over tonight, but was in the news and all this other stuff.
8205660	8207660	So, you know, it's fine.
8207660	8211660	There's it's like we said earlier about inclusiveness.
8211660	8215660	You can include stuff with adding to it.
8215660	8217660	Yeah, exactly.
8217660	8223660	But my thing is, if this is successful enough and we see like these little science fair robotic
8223660	8227660	kits, somebody is going to come up with something to tether it to the Switch.
8227660	8233660	I mean, buying like one of these little robot kits, you load the Switch software, use the
8233660	8235660	JoyCon to control it and stuff like that.
8235660	8237660	Is it Rock'em Sock'em Robots?
8237660	8238660	There's your money maker right there.
8238660	8239660	By the way, I copyrighted that idea.
8239660	8242660	I get 15% off the top and 5% goes to OLR.
8242660	8247660	Except the problem is you don't own the patent on Rock'em Sock'em Robots.
8247660	8250660	But I own the idea of putting it on the Switch.
8250660	8251660	Ah.
8251660	8252660	Good luck.
8252660	8253660	I hope you have a good lawyer.
8253660	8255660	Yes, I do.
8255660	8257660	It's called Do We Cheat'em and How.
8257660	8261660	I got a good reference from Bobby Blackwolf.
8261660	8262660	I love it.
8262660	8266660	So are you personally going to pick up Labo or is this better for the kids?
8266660	8267660	This is better for the kids.
8267660	8268660	But you know what?
8268660	8272660	I kind of see myself getting a Switch before the year is out.
8272660	8276660	I'm just like, they couldn't get me with the Wii.
8276660	8280660	They couldn't get me with the Wii U and now they're bringing the games I wanted for Wii
8280660	8281660	U to the Switch.
8281660	8284660	I'm like, just take the credit card.
8284660	8285660	I don't want it.
8285660	8286660	Just take it.
8286660	8289660	Give me my stuff and just give me the bill.
8289660	8293660	I predict you will also have a moment of weakness before the year is over.
8293660	8295660	Probably.
8295660	8296660	Probably.
8296660	8297660	All right, Rama.
8297660	8299660	I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in some more calls.
8299660	8300660	But it's always good to hear from you.
8300660	8304660	And people should also be listening to Anime Jam Session to hear more of you.
8304660	8305660	Oh, definitely.
8305660	8308660	And it's also good to hear from all of y'all, especially Oogchon and Loki.
8308660	8312660	Well, Loki's not here tonight, so you haven't heard much from him.
8312660	8314660	Well, you know.
8314660	8317660	It's always a pleasure to hear from me.
8317660	8319660	It's all good.
8319660	8320660	I'll let Loki know he's alive.
8320660	8321660	Sorry, not sorry.
8321660	8322660	All right.
8322660	8323660	Stay fabulous, Rob.
8323660	8324660	All right.
8324660	8325660	You too.
8325660	8326660	All right.
8326660	8327660	Bye.
8327660	8328660	Bye.
8328660	8329660	Orange Lounge.
8329660	8330660	I'm sorry, I have coughs.
8330660	8332660	Orange Lounge, Hakkio.
8332660	8333660	I need water.
8333660	8336660	It's your turn to fill time, Darsara.
8336660	8341660	Well, I could give you the saga of what's happening in my Animal Crossing village.
8341660	8344660	Everyone sucks, and they're sending me on nothing but fetch quests.
8344660	8345660	The end.
8345660	8346660	No, seriously, though.
8346660	8352660	I mean, I did plan, by the way, on starting to stream.
8352660	8354660	I was going to do Halo.
8354660	8360660	I cannot find one that runs on PC, you know?
8360660	8365660	We set up a time to do it over here on my Xbox One version of the Anniversary Collection,
8365660	8366660	which is close enough.
8366660	8367660	Close enough.
8367660	8368660	Oh, my God.
8368660	8370660	Did you know that Koi sell for 4,000 bells?
8370660	8371660	No.
8371660	8372660	We have calls coming in.
8372660	8373660	Oh, good.
8373660	8374660	All right.
8374660	8375660	Hi, you're on...
8375660	8379660	Oh, I thought I grabbed that call, and it dropped right off.
8379660	8381660	So we'll see if that person calls our back.
8381660	8383660	Maybe it didn't appreciate being grabbed.
8383660	8384660	Maybe.
8384660	8386660	I hit the button, and then it freaked out.
8386660	8387660	Did you ask permission, Rob?
8387660	8393660	If you were calling, try to get back in.
8393660	8400660	In playing WoW again, I don't know if I ever told you about the webcomic that Slidekick
8400660	8401660	and I came up with.
8401660	8402660	About Animal Crossing?
8402660	8403660	No.
8403660	8404660	In WoW.
8404660	8405660	Oh, in WoW.
8405660	8406660	Sorry.
8406660	8407660	It was called Hillsbrad Blues.
8407660	8408660	Oh, yeah, yeah.
8408660	8409660	You did mention this.
8409660	8411660	I'm thinking that we might make this a happening again.
8411660	8413660	Yeah, you got to work on that.
8413660	8415660	But I did get the call back on the line.
8415660	8416660	Hi, you're on Orange Town's radio.
8416660	8417660	Who's this?
8417660	8418660	Hey, this is Akdeft.
8418660	8419660	Hey, Akdeft.
8419660	8420660	What's on your mind, buddy?
8420660	8424660	Well, the topic about the Overwatch League and all that stuff.
8424660	8425660	Yeah.
8425660	8432660	I want to continue more on that, but first of all, I do agree with you, and there needs
8432660	8435660	to be more representation from other people.
8435660	8446660	And not necessarily just like only people from other genders and that stuff.
8447660	8454660	Because, again, the League is overwhelmed with people from Korea, and that's obvious
8454660	8458660	because they're really good in the game, but aside from that.
8458660	8460660	It's a good start.
8460660	8464660	But, yeah, it's a good start and all that.
8464660	8470660	But I want to talk about why women aren't in the League, probably.
8470660	8471660	Okay.
8471660	8481660	So, yeah, I was saying, and the League owners were saying, too, that, well, the excuses,
8481660	8489660	like you said, that, well, they have to be in the same rooms, and they have to be together
8489660	8499660	tons of times, and they cannot afford people from the same team being in dates, having
8499660	8504660	a relationship, because in the performance-wise, it's going to be distracting.
8504660	8515660	So, they cannot be, like, if, like, for example, even if a relationship, sorry, relationship
8515660	8521660	moves from the League and all that stuff, if there's a breakup, there's going to be
8521660	8524660	like tons of things they need to fix.
8524660	8528660	So, in that sense, I do agree with that.
8528660	8539660	Now, before I know, because I know that sounds like an excuse, but in sports, the same things
8539660	8540660	happen.
8540660	8547660	Like, for example, and this is something I relate to mostly because it's soccer, they
8547660	8555660	don't have the players' spouses, their wives, like when they're going to do a big game
8555660	8560660	or something like that, because it can be distracting, and they're the wives, it's not
8560660	8566660	like, oh, they're going to be fighting or it's not going to be problems, but they can
8566660	8572660	get distracted, and it's important for them to be on their top performance, and I can
8572660	8580660	see the same thing happening with the Overwatch League, that not necessarily, like, okay,
8580660	8584660	they're going to be problems, but they're going to be distracted.
8584660	8586660	That's the thing.
8586660	8588660	Here's my thought, Akdeft.
8588660	8593660	Like, I respect your viewpoint and where you're coming from, and I understand that, you know,
8593660	8599660	traditionally in other types of sports leagues, this is what's been done, but this is supposed
8599660	8603660	to be, you know, something new, something, you know, esports, something kind of, you
8603660	8608660	know, technology for the new generation, and, you know, you can work together professionally
8608660	8611660	without having those types of circumstances.
8611660	8617660	For example, Dark Sakura, myself, and Loki, we all went to PAX together a few years ago,
8617660	8620660	and we all slept in the same hotel room, and do you know how much sex was had?
8620660	8621660	None.
8621660	8622660	That's gross.
8622660	8625660	These are my professional friends that I do this show with.
8625660	8627660	It's not like that at all.
8627660	8631660	So my point with that is that, you know, if these guys, and hopefully girls at some point,
8631660	8635660	are going to get paid to do Overwatch, you know, then they have to remember.
8635660	8640660	They've got to put their Overwatch careers ahead of this other stuff, and if they get
8640660	8644660	sucked into this other stuff, it could have an effect on their Overwatch careers.
8644660	8650660	Just like when, what's this guy's name, XQC or whatever his name is, mouthed off, you
8650660	8655660	know, it may have been something on his own Twitch stream on his own time, but unfortunately
8655660	8659660	what he did had an effect on the community, and that's why he had to get shut down and
8659660	8665660	get, you know, slapped on the butt about it, because he has to be professional.
8665660	8668660	So if you want to be a professional player, you have to act professional.
8668660	8672660	I don't think there's anything wrong with saying, okay, we're going to have boys and
8672660	8676660	girls in this league, and it's expected that you act professional.
8676660	8681660	If y'all want to date, okay, but at the end of the day, y'all better be able to act professional,
8681660	8684660	or you're out of here.
8684660	8687660	And that's the thing too, because I do agree with that.
8687660	8693660	They're professionals, they're getting paid, so they have to, like, to follow the
8693660	8700660	rules and all that, but again, I'm talking with Chad, and Matt is saying, I'm sorry,
8700660	8704660	but I'm calling bullshit, and I agree, people should be controlling themselves.
8704660	8709660	It's not only men, also the women, it can be both sides.
8709660	8715660	Again, not necessarily like, oh, women have an hour to blame, because it's not the thing.
8715660	8719660	But it can happen. So sorry about that.
8719660	8724660	Jamie, why don't you get us, Jamie's dying to comment here, go ahead.
8724660	8729660	Well, it's just the whole thing about being distracted, it, to me, stinks of the whole
8729660	8732660	thing with, like, girls' dress codes in school.
8732660	8735660	Oh, we don't want them to distract the boys from learning.
8735660	8738660	Yeah, men can't control themselves. Yeah, I get what feels like that, yeah.
8738660	8743660	If you treat a man like he can't control himself, he's going to expect to have you do the control for him.
8743660	8750660	They need to be held, and even women too, we all need to be held accountable if they pull this crap,
8750660	8756660	in any sport, really, and end up, you know, having a performance issue because of it,
8756660	8760660	hold them the fuck accountable. No matter who it is.
8760660	8762660	Treat them like a grown-up. Yeah.
8762660	8770660	And something I was commenting on too, there's reports of every Olympic event,
8770660	8778660	in any Olympic village, of people having sex, like, on and off, like, it's like an orgy, basically.
8778660	8784660	The people cleaning the villages find many, many stuff.
8784660	8785660	Yes, we'll just-
8785660	8787660	Are these people who just hand out condoms?
8787660	8790660	We'll let everybody fill in the gaps there, yeah.
8790660	8797660	But, again, I'm going to take this back to performance, since they're doing other things
8797660	8801660	other than mentally preparing for something really important.
8801660	8806660	And in the case of, like, something the Overwatch League, the point I was trying to make,
8806660	8815660	most of them are, what, around the 20, 23 age, so they're really young.
8815660	8822660	And I'm sorry about this, but they're still young.
8822660	8824660	They're still mentally children.
8824660	8825660	They're stupid stuff.
8825660	8831660	They're probably, and like I referenced earlier, just because there isn't any women in the league
8831660	8837660	doesn't mean they aren't already hooking up, statistically, of 133 dudes.
8837660	8838660	That's true.
8838660	8842660	There is something, a good point, just to go into psychology in general.
8842660	8843660	Sure.
8843660	8852660	Women, and I can vouch for this, our minds aren't fully developed until somewhere between the age of 21 to 24.
8852660	8855660	For men, it's actually 25 to 28.
8855660	8860660	But we have to be careful, because we don't want that to be a pass either, like for this guy.
8860660	8862660	It's not a pass, but it is a biological fact.
8862660	8865660	That is something that should be borne in mind.
8865660	8871660	And maybe, yes, there should be higher restrictions for that, but it still doesn't mean you can't have a co-ed team.
8871660	8872660	You know.
8872660	8878660	But I will give that, and it wasn't something that I thought of going into my points on that.
8878660	8886660	Yes, there is much poorer impulse control, because, I mean, sorry guys, y'all's brains aren't fully developed until you're almost 30.
8886660	8888660	Biological fact.
8888660	8890660	We're pretty much dumb.
8890660	8893660	Well, we just hope they all make good choices.
8893660	8901660	But, you know, again, and I'm probably going to hear from several people throughout this week, and I already was kind of getting into, I don't want to say getting into it on Twitter.
8901660	8905660	It's not like it was a fight or something, it was, you know, some dialogue on Twitter this week about this whole thing.
8905660	8908660	And, you know, but I'm going to stand my ground on this.
8908660	8915660	This is something I want to see us do better at, but I realize it's not something that's going to change overnight.
8915660	8924660	I realize we have to make the Overwatch community more welcoming to women, but I just want to reinforce, you know, I don't hate the Overwatch League or anything like that.
8924660	8925660	It's quite the contrary.
8925660	8936660	I want it to succeed, but I want it to succeed big, and I just think, you know, this is going to hold it back from really truly being accessible to everybody.
8936660	8945660	And once we can kind of solve some of these problems about how do we get our community lex tosic, how do we welcome more people from other countries, how do we welcome more women into this league.
8945660	8948660	I just kind of think it's going to be the same old thing.
8948660	8954660	It's never going to get taken seriously like any other esport, no matter how pretty it is.
8954660	8967660	Yeah, I do hope for the Overwatch League because I haven't fallen it, and it's good, but I do hope for the future of it that it does expand to that.
8967660	8982660	To have like co-ed teams for more people to be involved because it is something really awesome, and I would like to support it more, basically.
8982660	8990660	But yeah, it needs to grow. For the first year, it will do fine, but it does need to evolve.
8991660	8998660	Sorry, I'm getting my tongue twisted here. But it needs to work towards it.
8998660	9007660	Again, I do agree with the point that it needs to be men and women on the same teams and all that stuff.
9008660	9021660	And something that DarkSakura said earlier, oh you can make a women's league too, but no, I would actually rather have the both genders, or any gender, on the teams.
9021660	9029660	Like playing together, doing stuff together, because what was the thing before Overwatch? It's cooperative, it's teamwork.
9029660	9031660	You need to show that.
9031660	9044660	And I think the best thing we can do, you know, how do we fix that? Well, as fans of Overwatch, and this goes for anybody who wants to see Overwatch League succeed, or for anybody who's a fan of Overwatch, or any esport, I mean really, this argument can work for any esport, not just Overwatch League.
9044660	9049660	If you want to see your league do better in these types of ways, that has to start with you.
9049660	9061660	And that's where you have to help in calling out this toxic behavior when you see it, and this type of stuff when dude gets on his Twitch stream and says, you know, go suck a dick, you'd probably like it, and all that stuff.
9061660	9071660	You know, we don't have to end that guy's life completely, but we have to call it out and say, dude, not cool. That's not representative of the community we're trying to build here.
9071660	9074660	You need to go sit in the corner and work your own shit out.
9074660	9076660	You need to look at your life, look at your choices.
9076660	9092660	Yeah, look at your life, look at your choices. Or, again, going back to my reality TV popes, I'll use an all-time classic that I cite oftentimes on this show because it is gospel, and that would be the book of Tyra, and that would be, learn something from this.
9092660	9099660	And that's what I would say to XQC, learn something from this, we're rooting for you, we're all rooting for you.
9099660	9100660	Yeah.
9100660	9101660	There you go.
9101660	9103660	Yeah, hopefully it comes to that.
9103660	9115660	But, you know, and here's the thing, and here's why I think Overwatch League, and again, why maybe I'm being a little harsher on it than I am, oh, I don't know, say Counter-Strike or League of Legends or these other things.
9115660	9124660	I've been to BlizzCon, and I did that Horde House show, and I've seen the Blizzard community, and there's all sorts of diversity within that community.
9124660	9141660	There's a ton of women that play WoW, we have a show on this network hosted by two very amazing women that play World of Warcraft overseas, and they, you know, and they bring lots of men and women onto their show to talk about, you know, what's going on in Warcraft, and they know their shit when it comes to lore and all that stuff.
9141660	9153660	My point is, they've got a diverse community of Blizzard. Now it's time, you know, that's how they're, I think, enabled to maybe reflect that in their esports almost more than anybody else.
9153660	9160660	You know, I hope that Overwatch League looks as amazing as the audience at BlizzCon very soon.
9160660	9169660	So, anyway, I'm gonna close it on that, act deaf, but thanks for the call. Hey, I appreciate their perspective, even when we don't see completely eye-to-eye, I think we have at least some common ground here.
9170660	9181660	Hey, thanks for letting my opinion be fair, because I know I'm the murderer here, and I'm probably not right either, but that's the perspective I have from it.
9181660	9187660	So, sorry if I offended anyone, that wasn't my intention, so, again, thanks for having me.
9187660	9204660	You know what, I give you props for saying, hey, I'm trying to kind of learn, you know, maybe I'm not in the right place, so I'm trying to learn, and I understand, like, if you're driving a big rig truck down the highway, and you suddenly realize you're going the wrong way, you can't just flip a bitch in the middle of the highway and go the right way.
9204660	9218660	You're gonna have to plan your way to get off the freeway and turn around, and my point is, it's not, that change that I'm screaming about earlier on the show is not gonna happen overnight, but I hope it happens, you know, eventually.
9218660	9221660	So, anyway, my friend, I will see you next time, okay?
9221660	9222660	See ya.
9222660	9223660	See ya.
9223660	9224660	Alright, buh-bye.
9224660	9239660	I think that is a good call to end it on for tonight, so I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but you can always email us, participate at, excuse me, orangeslouchradio.com, I think that coughing fit is a time to say we need to throw in the towel and be done for tonight, but great show, thank you so much.
9239660	9241660	Thank you, Mel B, for being here.
9241660	9242660	Thank you.
9242660	9246660	Thank you, Jamie, for being here, as she always is, thank you to me for being here, thank myself.
9246660	9247660	You live here.
9247660	9248660	Doing great.
9248660	9249660	Thank you to Mr. Smoosh and Alan.
9249660	9252660	Yes, thank you to Mr. Smoosh and Alan for being inspirational.
9252660	9255660	Thank you to Loki for, you know, giving us some space tonight.
9255660	9256660	No, I'm just kidding.
9256660	9257660	Happy birthday.
9257660	9258660	We miss him.
9258660	9259660	Yes, happy birthday, Danny.
9259660	9260660	Danny.
9260660	9261660	Yes.
9261660	9262660	Who's now a mature four-year-old.
9262660	9266660	Well, probably more mature than some Overwatch players out there.
9266660	9268660	Ah, cheap shot, cheap shot, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
9268660	9269660	Alright.
9269660	9270660	Sometimes you gotta go for it.
9270660	9271660	Okay.
9272660	9276660	Anyway, you know, one thing I didn't get out, and I want to make sure it's clear, because
9276660	9279660	I just don't want some of these things I've said to go back and haunt me a little later
9279660	9280660	on.
9280660	9284660	Over the time we've done this show, and I've talked a lot about how OLR has been on the
9284660	9288660	year for many years, for many years and all that stuff, you know, I think the things that
9288660	9292660	have come out of my mouth, I haven't always been proud of, and that's what makes listening
9292660	9296660	to some of the older episodes harder to listen to, you know what I mean?
9296660	9302660	Like, even I feel like I've kind of changed over the last 700 episodes and learned a lot,
9302660	9303660	and that's because of many of you.
9303660	9309660	Like, for example, there was a time and place, and has probably happened on this show, where
9309660	9314660	I referred to something as Leo Tarted, but with a different word, okay?
9314660	9315660	You all know what I'm referencing, right?
9315660	9320660	And I think I've learned over the years that I probably shouldn't use that word, you know?
9320660	9323660	There's just other things I could say instead of that.
9323660	9328660	But again, like the big rig driving down the highway, I didn't change overnight, and
9328660	9330660	I know sometimes that word still leaves our mouths.
9330660	9335660	I think somebody said it on the show last week, and you know, but all we can do is kind
9335660	9340660	of call that out and say, maybe I'm going to do better next time, and I'm going to try
9340660	9341660	not to use that same language.
9341660	9345660	So I just kind of wanted to get that out there, because I'm sure if somebody really wanted
9345660	9350660	to, they could go back to episode 54 or something and find some shitty thing that I said, and
9350660	9353660	you know, I'm trying to do better too.
9353660	9354660	I think we all are.
9354660	9357660	Life is a learning adventure, is it not?
9357660	9359660	I think so.
9359660	9362660	Well, sometimes it's a nightmare.
9362660	9364660	But you already know everything, right, Darsara?
9364660	9365660	Of course I do.
9365660	9367660	All right, anyway.
9367660	9370660	Oh my gosh, though.
9370660	9373660	My tummy is a mess right now.
9373660	9378660	Well, feel better, but the good news is we're going to wrap it up, so we can close on shop
9378660	9379660	for tonight.
9379660	9380660	We'll be back next week.
9380660	9381660	Jamie will be here.
9381660	9382660	Loki will be back.
9382660	9385660	We'll talk about whatever happens in the news over the next week.
9385660	9387660	Thank you guys as always for tuning into Orange Launch Radio.
9387660	9391660	If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, we ask please tell a friend or two about
9391660	9392660	the show.
9392660	9395660	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but you
9395660	9399660	know, it's hard to air those voices when they're not here.
9399660	9403660	But I notice we have been growing a little bit in 2018, so it's been great to see faces,
9403660	9404660	old and new, here at OLR.
9404660	9405660	So help us spread the word.
9405660	9408660	A nice five-star review on iTunes or Google Play.
9408660	9412660	That stuff goes a long way towards discoverability, let me tell you.
9412660	9414660	So yeah, tell a friend, leave a nice review.
9414660	9415660	It really, really helps.
9415660	9418660	Thank you so much, because we don't have a million dollar website behind us or anything
9418660	9419660	like that.
9419660	9420660	Just us.
9420660	9421660	You know what?
9421660	9422660	And now we don't have a YouTube channel anymore.
9422660	9426660	Well, we do, but we're not going to get any coin from it.
9426660	9431660	Here's something, though, that just made me sit and realize.
9431660	9436660	We are so hipster before there was hipster.
9436660	9438660	No, seriously.
9438660	9444660	Because the way that we do our show is just so friendly and relatively low production
9444660	9447660	value for a high quality, I'd like to think.
9447660	9448660	I'd like to think.
9448660	9449660	Yeah.
9449660	9451660	Out of 715, there's been a few stinkers.
9451660	9453660	We are DIY.
9453660	9457660	We are the thread banger of internet radio.
9458660	9464660	And to be fair, there's a lot of people out there that are learning like we are.
9464660	9466660	We've been doing it a really fucking long time.
9466660	9473660	And we do what works, but we don't have to make it high production and have all the gear,
9473660	9479660	although I have been looking at Wish because I found some decent equipment.
9479660	9482660	We do what works for us and many of you out there.
9482660	9483660	For sure.
9483660	9484660	For sure.
9484660	9486660	Anyway, is that a final thought?
9486660	9490660	Or should I come back to you for an official final thought for the Evening Dark Sakura?
9490660	9497660	My final thought is that I want a holo dress, I think.
9497660	9499660	I think I want a holo dress.
9499660	9506660	Actually, there is something for anyone who can find me a copy of Robert Mundu, which
9506660	9508660	was Jumping Flash 3 in Japan.
9508660	9510660	Let me know if you find it.
9510660	9512660	Not on eBay.
9512660	9515660	I want to pay under $20 for it.
9515660	9520660	And my final thought is I want to have a holo deck.
9520660	9521660	A holo deck.
9521660	9525660	And every week in gaming, the technology brings us closer and closer to a holo deck.
9525660	9526660	Okay, okay.
9526660	9528660	I have something to call out right the fuck now.
9528660	9530660	Right.
9530660	9536660	Don't refer to humans as females and males because that's like you're talking about fucking
9536660	9538660	animals, okay?
9538660	9547660	Men, women, women, men, person, don't fucking talk about other humans like they're animals.
9547660	9550660	For those that may not know, is that just like a personal thing?
9550660	9552660	Like some people hate the word moist?
9552660	9556660	Or what is it about that word that is uncomfortable?
9556660	9558660	It's just rude.
9558660	9559660	Why?
9559660	9560660	Because-
9560660	9562660	I'm asking from a place of education.
9562660	9567660	It's like when you see someone says, oh, well, the females are doing this.
