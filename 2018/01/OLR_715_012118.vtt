Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Labo, Labo, Labo! Nintendo's foray into makerspace may be giving birth to the next generation of makers, or it may just be more narrow use accessories that don't survive a generation of gaming. Only time will tell, but in the meantime we've got more of this week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:52.000
Hello my friends, and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight. Episode number 715 for this, January 21st, 2018. My name is Rob Roberts on the Twitters at Skie, S-K-I-E, my old school DDR freak name, and that'll be relevant here in a minute.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
And over there next to me is, she always is, as she's always been on DDR freak and ever since, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:00.000 --> 01:10.000
I remember DDR freak and special things that happened around it. I remember being a moderator and just shaking my head at some of the shenanigans.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
I remember getting the little flashy foot towards the end of the run, that was exciting.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
I remember controversial bannings that I did.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
You laying the band hammer down on someone?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
Alright, we are going to have a little bit of an old school night tonight, and I'll get into that in a moment, but sadly not here tonight.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Tech master Loki, he has family commitments today, so he will not be joining us, but he'll be back next week.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
Big welcome to those of you that are joining us live, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
By the way, Bobby Black Wolf hitting 600 episodes tonight, so big congrats to Bobby Black Wolf on his landmark 600th episode.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I know he didn't do anything too special to celebrate.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
As we kind of hit a point ourselves, we were like, woo, another 100 mark, woo.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
But still, still, very, very, very few podcasters in that club.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I'm still a little disappointed we didn't have our big quinceañera.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Well, never say never. Might just be a little late.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
You know, my pal Aria Snark, who you're going to hear more about a little later, just saying.

02:13.000 --> 02:22.000
Aria Snark, she had a quinceañera for her 30th, so they did like a double quinceañera to catch her up, because she never had one originally.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
So never say never.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I never had one.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
We just didn't make it to 30 years ago.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
But they weren't a thing where I'm from.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
So here we are, it's just the two, isn't this weird, because last week we had so many people here in studio,

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
and then this week it's just you and me, feeling the love with our chatters at live.vognetwork.com.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
And hello to anybody that is checking out OLR thanks to last week's show.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
My understanding is that that show got passed around amongst the various Ingress communities.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Not just the opposition here figured out about it and was listening a little bit, so hey guys.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
And I guess it got out, some folks on the East Coast were like, oh yeah, Snow told me about the show, I checked it out.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
So thanks you guys, and that's awesome.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
We hope that you're still listening.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah, that would be awesome.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Sadly, I don't have a lot of Ingress tonight, because I haven't played as much.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
I bumped both of your portals over there, but you've got one that's gone white, so I didn't have time to do anything to it.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
I've had a lot of other stuff going on, which will make sense here shortly.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
My nemesis has been trying to take my neighborhood.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Well, psh, psh, psh.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Give me some posters, please.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I didn't think we were going to talk about Ingress tonight, but here we are.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
See, there you go.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Now, there you go, your five seconds of Ingress talk.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Just to keep that crowd here tonight.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
But we do talk about-

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Rob needs to give me bursters.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
That's the story.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Well, I don't know if I have.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Well, I think I have a few.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
We'll probably give some away.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
I need some that aren't, you know, level six, like what I have now.

03:45.000 --> 03:53.000
Anyway, what we do talk about here at Orange Lawn Triadio are all different types of video games, be it console, PC, you know, pretty much everything.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
But this show started many years ago, over 15 years ago.

03:57.000 --> 04:07.000
Dark Sakura, myself, and Loki, who's not here, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution and other games that were in Konami's B-Moni series or Beatmania.

04:07.000 --> 04:16.000
Or basically, they're a series dedicated to hit the note, or hit the button to play the note in time with the music, would be, I guess, the most simple way I could describe it.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
We're going to talk a little more about that tonight, actually.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
We're going to do a little bit of a throwback.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
So whereas last week was all about a modern cell phone game, tonight we're going to talk a little bit later here at the top of the show in about 20 minutes or so.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
We're going to talk with an old friend of the show.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
This is a big throwback.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
I think he was on like our sixth episode of the show, and then a few episodes after that.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
We're up to 715 now.

04:36.000 --> 04:45.000
But our pal Mel B is going to join us tonight over Skype to talk about an upcoming freestyle DDR tournament that's happening in the Bay Area this next weekend.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
And even if you can't be there in person, you're going to be able to check it.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
Thanks to the technology and how far it's come in 15 years, you're going to be able to check it out all over the world.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
So we'll talk to Mel about DDR and freestyle and where that's all at.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
So it's a little blast of the past.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I wish I still played DDR regularly.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
I'd probably be about 20 pounds lighter, but here we are.

05:06.000 --> 05:15.000
You think Pokemon Go and all the walking I do with that might have helped with the old weight, the beer gut, even though I don't really drink beer.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I can't really talk about that.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Let's see, actdeft in chat, starting us off tonight talking about Dark Soccer's ban hammer.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Fear Dark Soccer's ban hammer.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
It is tough, but fair.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Dark Tetsuya talking about the DDR scene.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
The Wednesday nights at RVGL, good fucking times.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I started playing again this year.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
I did a weekly thing in 2012, but figured I'd start up again.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
You know what? It's a good habit to have.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
It's a very good habit to have.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
My pal JD, who you've heard on this show many times and you see in chat once in a while,

05:50.000 --> 05:57.000
he's also very good at trying to get me to play DDR when he's visiting or I'm visiting there because he still plays pretty regularly.

05:57.000 --> 06:05.000
As I understand it, there was a pretty big Perfect Attack tournament that happened this last weekend at G5.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
We'll hear more about that later, so we'll wait for that.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
In the meantime though, before we get to that, let's start off our show with a kickoff topic

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
and some really big Nintendo news this week that could be about the future of gaming?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Dark Soccer, tell us a little bit about Labo.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
Well, I watched the commercial for it and I was like, the fuck is this?

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
And then I was like, this is pretty cool.

06:29.000 --> 06:36.000
I mean, it's all cardboard, but the fact that you get these kits and basically they're paper craft.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
In a nutshell, they're paper craft.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Putting them together, I think, is probably the most fun of it.

06:42.000 --> 06:51.000
But then it's used, I guess in conjunction, there's places to put in the controller, the Joy-Con and everything on the Switch,

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
and even places to put the screen so that each of these little kits gives you a different experience.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
I wonder though, I didn't see if they come with a game to use that peripheral with?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Or like a tool?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
They didn't really explain the games.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
You can see that the screens are running some sort of game, at least some of them.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
It looked like that little robot that crawled around on the ground.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
The screen was the controls, basically.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
You were controlling the controllers with your controller.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
And there seemed to be some sort of pseudo-VR going on.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Very pseudo-VR.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Pseudo-pseudo, yeah.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Pseudo-wudo, actually, since this is Nintendo.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
But anyway.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
That's Hal, Rob.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Here's one of the games that was there.

07:36.000 --> 07:45.000
Do you remember a couple years ago at E3, Miyamoto was presenting his demos that justify why the Wii U has a gamepad.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
That's kind of what it was.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
And one of those demos ended up being the Star Fox spin-off tactical game they had that came with the Star Fox.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
But then the other was that robot that punched things. That was there.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
It's probably not the same thing that you guys saw at E3 that year, but it's been repurposed.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
But all ideas spawn new ideas.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
Honestly, I'd like to think that it's a very original concept.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
It's something new, and I think people look at anything new with skepticism.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
However, I think Nintendo's got a track record of taking what we're skeptical about and making it a success.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Well, usually.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
That's why I said there's a record.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
Okay, because I was going to say, Virtual Boy, Wii U, not always.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Honestly enough, I liked the Wii U a lot better than I thought I would.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
But sales-wise, it just didn't happen.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Because people are stupid.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Namely third parties.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
But the Wii U is what spawned the Switch. I truly believe that.

08:47.000 --> 08:54.000
Oh, sure. I think the Switch is kind of what the Wii U was supposed to be, but the technology kind of just wasn't there.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
It just wasn't there yet.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I think it was there to sort of wet the palate.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah.

09:00.000 --> 09:07.000
And so, I look at the Wii U as the evolution phase.

09:07.000 --> 09:16.000
When you look at the human evolution, it's like the one with the weird shape and head that eventually becomes what grows into humanity.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Excuse me.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Oh, you alright over there?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah, no.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
The joys of doing live. Sometimes there's coughs and burps and things that happen.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Well, no.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
We're human.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
I think part of the side effect of my surgery is a lot of burping. Sorry. Sorry about it. Not sorry.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
It's gonna happen.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
But I really do...

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
There are people who I think are looking at this as, oh, this is just for kids.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
But you gotta think about it.

09:46.000 --> 09:55.000
I think that the adult who has lost their childlike imagination may as well be somewhat dead inside.

09:55.000 --> 10:07.000
I seriously believe that. You've got those people out there who are only worried about their business or just mundane things.

10:07.000 --> 10:16.000
And I think that the moment that you lose that spark of imagination that you had as a child, it's a little death to me.

10:16.000 --> 10:25.000
And so I was excited by this because there's a lot of imagination, a lot of passion that's gone into an idea like this.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
And I really want to see it work.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
You know, Nintendo did come out in the beginning and say, what we're about to announce is for kids and for the kid inside you.

10:32.000 --> 10:39.000
So, you know, you kind of had to if you were thinking, oh, it's going to be this the smash announcement today, like you are just you're on crack.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
If you thought that's where it was going, like they warned you it was going to be something a little different.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.000
And I honestly was kind of like, honest to God, my mind was like, maybe they're going to do like a Sesame Street channel.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Like, you know, we had no idea what was coming.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
So I was like, oh, maybe there'll be like a Sesame Street channel coming on Nintendo Switch.

10:56.000 --> 11:03.000
And, you know, the kid in all of us can go watch the episodes of the 70s or like or watch that hella awesome Pointer Sisters.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Anyway, see, who doesn't remember that? That's our age anyway.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
That's our age. I'm glad you added that.

11:13.000 --> 11:21.000
If you're if you're younger and you have no idea what we're referencing, you owe it to yourself to go to YouTube and like Pointer Sisters 12.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I'm sure would come up with it.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Was it on Sesame Street?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah, it was on Sesame Street at one point. Yeah.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
You know.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Great. Now I'm just feeling.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
It's all right. I was going to finish my thought anyway.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Yeah, please do.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
So this whole thing kind of came out of left field.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I don't think anybody could have predicted this.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
We had no leaks that were really pushing that direction or anything.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
So, you know, this this was a very hard thing to call.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I watched the trailer and I was kind of pleasantly surprised.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
I mean, certainly I had that reaction of like, it's cardboard.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Nintendo is going to sell you cardboard.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
And of course, I wrote all the sassy tweets to go along with that in my cheap ploy for retweets.

11:58.000 --> 12:07.000
But at the end of the day, I was like, you know, but if any company is going to make cardboard cool, like it's going to be Nintendo.

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
And yes, I realize like the fishing pole has like some cheap string and some like washer plastic washer looking things.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
So it's not 100 percent cardboard.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
But let's be real. Those kits are not going to be that expensive to make.

12:19.000 --> 12:33.000
And Nintendo stands to make a big profit with it, which honestly is my only hesitation with this is that everything we saw in that little commercial is going to cost one hundred and thirty dollars because it's sixty dollars for one pack.

12:33.000 --> 12:42.000
Seventy dollars for the robot pack, which is probably I'm going to guess being as it was the Miyamoto demo is going to be the more fully featured game, which is why it's a little more expensive.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
But I'm just like, I think at that price point, though, it's going to have to come with some software.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
It does come with software, but they're like, they're there.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Well, we don't know what the robot thing is, really.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
But as far as like the piano and the it's kind of tech demo, you know, one is neat, though it's neat.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
But is it something you're going to enjoy for very long after you build it?

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
And I'm just I need less shit in this house.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
You've seen my garage.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
You know, the shelf of Bimani, you know, peripherals I have.

13:12.000 --> 13:20.000
And so on my leftover Genesis and SNES era peripherals, you've seen the stack.

13:20.000 --> 13:30.000
And I keep thinking the advantage of something like this is that once it's assembled, it could be disassembled and stored.

13:30.000 --> 13:41.000
You know, you know, for me, if I got something like this, I'd probably end up laminating the aura, treating the cardboard.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
If you could, it might throw it off, especially I'm thinking that little robot where the controllers move it.

13:47.000 --> 13:54.000
If you make that cardboard too heavy with the weight and even maybe using like epoxy or resin, I'm just saying using like a sealant.

13:54.000 --> 14:02.000
Or, you know, like what I do, you can and here's cosplay tip number twenty one from Jamie.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
A little DIY stuff. You can get mod podge.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
It's you use it for decoupage and for doing paper crafts.

14:10.000 --> 14:18.000
But mod podge is also a sealant for paper and cardboard and you use it for sealing up a decoupage.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
You know, decoupage is right?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Yeah.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Well, for those who don't know, decoupage is taking like cutouts and pieces of paper.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
It's like a scrapbook.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Kind of.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
But you do it either in patterns or different things or for collage and then you seal it over with the mod podge.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
That's why you got the Polaroid camera recently, right? Was to do stuff like that.

14:34.000 --> 14:42.000
No, I got the Polaroid camera because one of my friends who will, hopefully I can have him on the show before he goes back to Australia,

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
is my friend JJ, who sometimes shows up in chat, who's going to be down here for DragCon.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
We're going to DragCon together.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Fine.

14:51.000 --> 14:59.000
But I started looking at his forays into Polaroids and I was already into Holga photography.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
And so I picked up a Polaroid Spectra for 20 bucks.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
I picked up a pack of film for 20 bucks.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Sorry, just to go back to the Labo thing for a little bit.

15:09.000 --> 15:15.000
I do think it's going to be very interesting to see all the people that are going to be like, here's how I blinged out my robot.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Or here's, you know, it is going to inspire that level of creativity.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
You saw how they were painting them and everything.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
So clearly it can take a layer of something on it.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Can't I, I mean, Jamie, can't I look at something in the gaming industry?

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
And I don't think we do this enough as gaming fans.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
You know, a lot of what we see on Twitter is cynicism and social media and stuff like that.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
Can't I, as a gaming fan, look at Nintendo Labo and go, that is really awesome.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
I'm probably not going to buy it, but that's awesome for like the kids.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
Like if I had kids and I wanted to get them interesting in engineering.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
And the really cool thing about something like Labo and especially the day and age that we live in.

15:50.000 --> 15:58.000
Like that's something that like girls and boys and no matter gender, no matter ethnicity or any of that stuff.

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
You could like be super into that and express your like creative senses through something like Labo.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Which was basically Legos to us back in the day.

16:06.000 --> 16:13.000
Remember Lego had that really cool statement in the seventies about something like it doesn't, man, they wrote, remember they wrote that letter.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
And it was like a letter to a girl or something. It was like, it doesn't matter who you are.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Yeah. Lego had like a really awesome letter in the seventies.

16:19.000 --> 16:30.000
And I, um, I think though it's only going to be a matter of time that people are going to buy the Labo, you know, and then recreate and put the patterns online, you know.

16:30.000 --> 16:37.000
But I think that what's going to, I honestly think that the price point is going to be coming from software that's packaged in with it.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Oh sure.

16:38.000 --> 16:46.000
And the fact that there's probably going to be other pieces of software virtually that are going to make use of the Labo peripherals.

16:46.000 --> 16:54.000
It could be very interesting to see what happens with Labo in the future. Like, you know, I think about this, you know, I say this a little bit tongue in cheek, but not really.

16:54.000 --> 17:02.000
Like I think about, okay, so we just recently had the Super Mario cereal that came out, right? And the Super Mario cereal had the amiibo chip inside the box.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
So people were trying to find those boxes like crazy to get the, the cereal amiibo basically, right?

17:06.000 --> 17:17.000
Well, um, why couldn't maybe Super Mario cereal next time be a Labo? The cardboard could actually become a Labo and you could download a silly little thing.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
It doesn't have to be complex. You don't have to package it in with like a piano or some shit, but you know, something kind of simple, silly.

17:23.000 --> 17:30.000
I was actually kind of surprised. I think that if there was going to be one, you'd get the piano one would be it.

17:30.000 --> 17:37.000
But now look at this. What if Labo support got third party support and we start seeing...

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
And they say it might.

17:38.000 --> 17:48.000
And say that, I'm just going to use this as a what if, you know, a wish. A wish. It may not even happen. It's unrealistic.

17:48.000 --> 18:02.000
But say that they get licensing from Konami and then do a Labo, say five key beat mania or let you use the piano peripheral for a light version of keyboard mania.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
You know, wouldn't something like that really pique your interest?

18:06.000 --> 18:14.000
Actually, yes. If the piano thing was like a music based game where the music was really like interesting, like I would really be into that.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
And I would actually say, though, out of all of the things they showed, that piano interested me the most.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
And the technology inside it is pretty badass. Like I have to say. Like the way the infrared sensor reads like the thing on the...

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
That's fucking science, but like simple science.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
Well, and on top of that, some of this Labo stuff makes me think of those.

18:33.000 --> 18:40.000
You know, if you go into a hobby shop, which Dan and I were spending a lot of times at hobby shops, you know, about a year ago when he was really into RC cars.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
But you go into those hobby shops and you see these build your own spider or build your own...

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
You know, they sell circuit boards and people are building their own, you know, little...

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
That's kind of like the precursor into that level of engineering.

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
You know, you take the teenage kits and you've made it more accessible for say people.

18:59.000 --> 19:12.000
I'd say like maybe between six and ten, you know, that's going to be the thing that leads up into, you know, going into junior engineering and then having that interest in...

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
Or even like for me as an artist, just looking at how I love paper craft.

19:17.000 --> 19:25.000
And I love things like that, that you take one single sheet and you make it into something amazing.

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
You're right. And those types of things that you do, like as a kid, can totally set you on a path later in life.

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
It might not, but it might. And I think about, you know, again, I'm going to date myself, but I thought these things were so rad.

19:37.000 --> 19:47.000
Who remembers back in the day, Radio Shack used to sell like those kits where you'd have those little springs and you could connect wires between the springs and you learn about electricity.

19:47.000 --> 19:55.000
And it was usually like a 20 in one kit where you could build like a little light, you could build, you know, a little a simple little switch, things like that.

19:55.000 --> 20:01.000
One of the kits would let you build a simple radio transmitter so you could actually like broadcast.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
And it was it was so low that like it wouldn't work very far outside your house. Like you weren't gonna be able to pirate radio with it.

20:06.000 --> 20:13.000
But like and I was blown away by the fact that like I could do something in my room and my mom could hear it in her bedroom.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
And look where we are now.

20:16.000 --> 20:25.000
Well, I just remember, you know, getting like the the big nine volt batteries. Is that what they were? They were nine volt?

20:25.000 --> 20:32.000
Yeah. And making electromagnets and then ruining our floppy disks.

20:32.000 --> 20:39.000
And then not to get too nostalgic here, but I'll kind of end on this note. I think about, you know, you and I grew up on Mr. Wizard's World.

20:39.000 --> 20:46.000
And like a lot of the stuff in that show was stuff around the house that Mr. Wizard would turn into the science experiments.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
I don't know if he ever did Diet Coke and Mentos, but I'm sure he did something similar. I did volcanoes and stuff.

20:51.000 --> 20:58.000
I did the Mobius one that he did, you know, where you take the paper, give it a half twist and tape it in a loop.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
And when you cut it, it'll either make loops or it'll do one.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
It's a Mobius is the only one truly one sided object.

21:06.000 --> 21:17.000
You know, it's just things like that. You know, it's it's why I go back to say that you can't ever, ever lose that spark of wonder and imagination.

21:17.000 --> 21:23.000
Because then it's when, you know, it's a little it's a little death. It's the death of the child in you.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
You can't ever lose that. And that's why I really appreciate this project.

21:28.000 --> 21:35.000
So let me ask, end with this question, ask this question, and then we're going to do a quick announcement that we're going to get to our interview tonight.

21:35.000 --> 21:42.000
Where do you stand with Labo? Are you going to pick it up? Or Labo? I can only say Labo like it's Cabo, Wabo, Labo, but it's Labo.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
Do we have an official pronunciation? I think Labo makes sense because Nintendo Labo.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
That's if you're making it all American. But if it's Japanese, it would be Labo.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
Oh, OK. OK. Well, anyway, what's your stance on it? You're going to buy it?

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
I want to wait to see all the kits and I'll make my decision if there's a kid I like, but chances are leading in.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
We know we have these two. We have two kits to start. They'll probably be more. The piano one really interests me.

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
Yeah. So I don't know if I will jump in day one. However, I plan to tell my friends with kids about it.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah, I think that's kind of where I'm at. I know that Julian already wants a switch.

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
I don't think he wants to buy him a switch. But this oh, man, Julian, Julian, this is right up his alley, right up his alley.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
Like almost like if I were to buy it, it would be so like Julian could come over and play it.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
Yeah, I would actually just say, you know, buy the kit and bring him over to play.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
Yeah, right. The only thing he wants to play right now is Breath of the Wild, which is also cool.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
It's like there's nothing else to play. They bring him over. All right.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
I'm going to do a little bit of housekeeping here with a very special announcement here and then we're going to give our pal Mel B a call.

22:46.000 --> 22:55.000
So I don't know if Twitter beat me to it, but I'm going to be announcing today a brand new show is joining the Voice of Geeks Network, VOG Network.

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
And this is another in-house production. For those of you that remember Poke Stop podcast, rest in peace.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
This is an in-house production, but it actually does not have to do with games.

23:05.000 --> 23:13.000
This is a new production between myself and my pal who is a cosplay artist. Her name is Aria Snark, but you can call her Victoria.

23:13.000 --> 23:19.000
That is what most people know her as. And the new podcast is called Shaking and Crying.

23:19.000 --> 23:28.000
And episode number one is available right now over at vognetwork.com and soon to be shakingandcrying.com as soon as I get the pointer to point over to the right place.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
This show is going to be all about basically geek culture, pop culture, and the hosts sassing each other.

23:34.000 --> 23:41.000
That is what the show is all about. In episode one, you're going to be able to hear us talk about the latest that's going on over the YouTube controversy.

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
We're going to talk a little bit about the trend for reboots in Hollywood because apparently they're going to reboot Lost, which is like what?

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
Didn't they already tell us how that ends? And we'll talk about Facebook Live as well.

23:52.000 --> 23:59.000
So there's lots of stuff on the show. And for those of you listening live tonight, you can get a special sneak preview right after OLR tonight.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
We're going to play episode one for you in its entirety right after Orange Laundry tonight.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
But I'm really excited about it. It's been a while since I had more than one podcast.

24:07.000 --> 24:14.000
And let's see, reading is fundamental is coming back. And then I have about two more on the radar, don't I DarkSakura?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
So I'm back to podcasting full time.

24:16.000 --> 24:27.000
Well, thankfully, one of them is going to be just a tiny little quickie. It'll be like, you know, do it and have a smoke.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
You know why?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Why?

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Because it's us.

24:33.000 --> 24:41.000
All right. Let's let's see if we can get over to our pal Mel B. I'm going to give him a call here on the Twitters and I see on the Twitters on the Skype.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
And I see he's listening right now. So hopefully he's anticipating this.

24:44.000 --> 24:51.000
We're going to talk to him all about the DDR freestyle takeover, which is coming up this Saturday in San Jose.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
I think we have Mel on the line. Hey, Mel, you there?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
If you can hear me, you absolutely do.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
We can absolutely hear you. How are you, my friend?

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
It has been far too long since we've had you on OLR.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
Oh, gosh. Yeah, since. Yeah, you're right. I think it was the six hundredth episode.

25:06.000 --> 25:16.000
I think you actually I think I had a very brief like chime in when you called the misses about someone having a question about purchasing an arcade game.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
Oh, God, that's right. That was the last time we talked to you.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
I think the last time you were physically on this show was when Shermy was alive.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
Yeah, I think you haven't physically been here in a while, but you were here for episode six.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
And how about that, Mel? Did you think we'd make it this long?

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
I didn't even think like twenty eighteen would be a possibility.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
Like, just in my mind, I thought the world was just going to be dead by now.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
You know, that's true. Y2K did scare the hell out of all of us back.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Oh, wait a minute. This would have been after Y2K. Damn it. Bad joke. All right.

25:47.000 --> 25:55.000
But I know something that came out before Y2K that we got into the birth of this show was Dance Dance Revolution.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
And this was a game that you played a lot of back in the day, right?

25:59.000 --> 26:07.000
Oh, yeah. Actually, a couple of months ago, I celebrated like 18 years of playing that game.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Wow.

26:08.000 --> 26:14.000
Yeah, because I played in October of ninety nine. First time was in Vegas out of Gameworks.

26:14.000 --> 26:24.000
You know, Mel, I've never told you this, but the first time I had even heard of you was checking the top scores in DDR on the online board.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
You mean like for DDR USA?

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
Yeah. And I remembered how you put your name in there.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
Oh, wow. I didn't even know I was like ranked that high for a hot minute.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
You were on there. I was like...

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
It was probably on doubles, I bet.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Yeah, but...

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
Did he put his initials in as Mel B? And I'm like, I love the Spice Girls.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
No, it was... I'll go ahead and say it if you don't mind.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
It was Mel penis cock land.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
Wait, wait a second. Did I put it that way?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Yes.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
That's impossible.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
You must have him confused with a much nastier Mel.

27:02.000 --> 27:10.000
No, I went back and checked and it had changed. But I remembered because I think I asked and someone said it was you.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And it was pretty high up there.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
But that... I never have told you this, but that was my first...

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Somebody's impersonating him. All right.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
It was a pretty good score, though. I wouldn't doubt if it was you.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
Those damn Russians, they were just using me as a test case.

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
Fake news. All right, look. So look, 18 years ago you first got into DDR.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
Here we are all these years later and you're still playing it, right?

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
I heard you did a perfect attack thing this weekend, as did a lot of people.

27:40.000 --> 27:47.000
There was a pretty good turnout at G5 yesterday. So they had a score attack tournament.

27:48.000 --> 27:54.000
What's kind of interesting about this was, A, it was on an Extreme machine, but it wasn't just any old Extreme machine.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Have you heard about Extreme Pro?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
No, I have not.

27:58.000 --> 28:05.000
So, get this. Very recently there was some sort of, I guess, pack for lack of a better term.

28:05.000 --> 28:14.000
Someone had re-engineered it so that when you play a standard game, it already defaults to a Marvelous timing.

28:14.000 --> 28:20.000
So you know how in Extreme you can only get the Marvelous versus perfect in the Oni or the non-stop modes?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Right.

28:21.000 --> 28:33.000
So now you can do this in a regular play because of the more recent versions of DDR, they use that sort of EX system as the standard grading for score attack.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
And so now for tournament purposes they do the same thing.

28:36.000 --> 28:47.000
You know I'm not terribly surprised to hear that because I know Dance Maniacs had the upgrade to that years later that would allow extra songs to be added to that machine.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
There was a whole fan mix, I don't know what you want to call it, that kind of upgraded that machine.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
So I'm kind of not surprised to hear somebody went back and did the similar treatment to DDR Extreme. That's pretty cool.

28:57.000 --> 29:04.000
Yeah, it was just nice to see a lot of the old, especially Dance Mania type licenses and stuff back on that thing.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
And it felt like, hey, I could actually play most of these songs.

29:08.000 --> 29:17.000
Now, and a lot of what we hear about DDR these days, because I know we had some stories going around the blogs recently of like Konami had a world tournament.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
And all this stuff about DDR, but a lot of it has to do with the score attack or the perfect attack.

29:23.000 --> 29:30.000
You know, the actual timing of being able to hit the feet to the arrows with the music and the step charts and all that.

29:30.000 --> 29:41.000
But you're here tonight to talk about something a little different, or when I think back to back in the day, the other half of DDR tournaments that got lost somewhere along the way, weirdly.

29:41.000 --> 29:49.000
Or maybe it didn't and you're going to correct me, but that would be DDR Freestyle. So for those that don't know, what's DDR Freestyle?

29:50.000 --> 30:03.000
So Freestyle is like pretty much going on machine and it's kind of like the performance art side of DDR, where you would actually kind of put up a routine that you sort of pre-plan.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.000
And you know, you perform, you do like an actual dance move in tune with the arrows. You know, you kind of like get creative with it.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
You can do like comedy things. You can like juggle. You can do all sorts of stuff out there.

30:14.000 --> 30:20.000
If you just Google or like, you know, YouTube DDR Freestyle, you'll see it. It's like, wow, this is the kind of crazy stuff that people do.

30:20.000 --> 30:31.000
And a funny thing, I remember like a few months after I started playing DDR, my friend Ross, he like pings me in ICQ and says, dude, we've been playing this game wrong all this time.

30:31.000 --> 30:38.000
And shows me a video from Japan where a dude is practically breakdancing on machine and we're just like, oh damn, that's how you play it.

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
Is that what enabled you to start Freestyle? Because you were pretty big into Freestyle back in the day, right?

30:44.000 --> 30:50.000
For our listeners who may not know, what types of like, what types of badges do you have from the DDR Freestyle days?

30:50.000 --> 30:56.000
Let's see. Well, I mean, overall, I've won about probably 10 Freestyle tournaments.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
The first big one that I won, I guess you could say, was Santa Monica Pier in 2000.

31:00.000 --> 31:07.000
That was kind of a huge deal because that was the first time like NorCal went down to SoCal and we were like, hey, you know, we can hang with you guys.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
And it was judged by three guys who were like super big in the DDR scene in Japan at the time.

31:12.000 --> 31:18.000
So the fact that one of those judges gave me like a personal award for what I did, I was like, dang, you know?

31:18.000 --> 31:24.000
And it just kind of snowballed from there. I won like at Metreon, won in like a couple in SoCal.

31:24.000 --> 31:35.000
Actually, an arcade machine I have at home, the DDR Solo 2000 was something that I won at Arcade Infinity 2, that tournament back in 2001.

31:35.000 --> 31:42.000
Yeah, that's that's the one I know is the big one because you actually got a DDR machine as a prize. That's a pretty big deal.

31:42.000 --> 31:49.000
Yeah, that's not too many machines. I've been won by like just people in general, at least within California.

31:49.000 --> 31:58.000
I know if I could think of only maybe three people that won a machine, I'd be myself. I know 8Ball won a machine and Bruce Leroy.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
Yeah, he won a machine. All freestyle.

32:01.000 --> 32:08.000
And if you guys have questions for Mel B or any comments, you can join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com where Bob Coffey says,

32:08.000 --> 32:14.000
Whoa, Arcade Infinity, I haven't heard that name in a long time. Yeah, well, it's because they unfortunately went under.

32:14.000 --> 32:19.000
They're no longer around. And rest in peace, Arcade Infinity says MXC.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
But many, many good memories made at Arcade Infinity with these tournaments and so forth.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
So backing up a little bit, was it that ICQ conversation, which I'm cracking up because you had a conversation on ICQ.

32:29.000 --> 32:36.000
Was it an ICQ conversation that led to you getting into freestyle or what enabled you to start this whole freestyle stuff?

32:36.000 --> 32:43.000
I think after, you know, obviously when we were first playing the game, we're still just trying to learn to play the game.

32:43.000 --> 32:50.000
I kind of had a modicum of how to play rhythm games because my first love was always bust a move slash bust a groove.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Heck yeah.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
That's like, yeah, that game got me into import games and like just music games in general.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Me too. Me too. Same drug.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
Yeah, so when I saw that game for the first time, I was like, dude, this is bust a groove with your feet. I'm totally in.

33:02.000 --> 33:10.000
So yeah, after like maybe two or three months of sort of, you know, taking my lumps, getting my ass kicked on like my fire because of all the jumps.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
Yeah, just once I saw the performance part of it, I'm like, oh, okay, well, that looks cool in me.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
I mean, it's not like I had a professional dance background or anything like that.

33:21.000 --> 33:28.000
I was pretty much like a kid growing up in the 80s and 90s, grew up on like a little bit watching breakdancing on TV.

33:28.000 --> 33:33.000
I watched like MTV. It was basically my babysitter between junior high and early college.

33:33.000 --> 33:40.000
So I always watch like club MTV, The Grind, all that kind of stuff. I could do everything from like Bobby Brown and like Janet and all that stuff.

33:40.000 --> 33:47.000
I just, you know, watched and like played along at home and it's like, whoa, I could kind of do this on DDR and like no one be none the wiser.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
So I pulled it off.

33:49.000 --> 33:55.000
Kids today will never know the wonders of television programs where you just watch other people dance.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
Dude, Soul Train after Saturday morning cartoons.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Right?

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
That was me.

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
Soul Train lines, man. Honestly, that's one of the best rabbit holes you can fall into on YouTube.

34:05.000 --> 34:11.000
If you just YouTube, Google like Soul Train dance lines, you have like an instant hour of like pure happiness.

34:11.000 --> 34:19.000
And then you Wikipedia who the dancers were, the Soul Train dancers, and find out where they are now, which I spent two nights ago doing that.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Damn those Wikipedia black holes.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like Fred Rerunberry from like What's Happening?

34:25.000 --> 34:32.000
Yeah. Like I think it was a couple of guys who joined Shalimar was actually like Jody Watley, Jeffrey, what's his name?

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
But yeah, they were all discovered through Soul Train.

34:35.000 --> 34:41.000
So Mel, kind of going back to a point I brought up earlier, you know, DDR, we see it in the news recently.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
It's kind of come back like DDR, you know, it felt like it kind of went away for a little while.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
You just you were hearing more about the rock bands and guitar heroes of the world.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
You weren't really hearing a lot about DDR.

34:50.000 --> 34:59.000
And it just feels like within the past few years, especially with DDR Ace, especially with round one kind of becoming bigger and bigger and getting a lot of the DDR machines.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
Same thing with Dave and Busters are kind of getting a lot of those machines in their arcades.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
It feels like DDR is coming back a bit.

35:04.000 --> 35:10.000
And we do hear about tournaments, but the tournaments really focus on score attack and perfect attack, which is cool.

35:10.000 --> 35:16.000
That's the stuff I used to do, you know, when I was much thinner playing DDR back in those days.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
So that's cool that that's getting all that recognition.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
But what happened to Freestyle, Mel? Where did the Freestyle go?

35:22.000 --> 35:30.000
Honestly, I would say a lot of it died around 2007-ish or so, because it was after, I think, a couple of years of Supernova.

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
And really the arcade releases were kind of few and far in between.

35:35.000 --> 35:41.000
It kind of started petering out in USA because we had a lot of competition from the non-dancing games.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
You know, we had like people playing guitar hero and rock band stuff at home.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
That's probably one thing.

35:47.000 --> 35:56.000
But really it's just, I mean, if I were to believe everything that Jason Enos, who was like the product manager of DDR in USA.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
He knew that Japan wasn't really big on marketing dance games out here.

36:01.000 --> 36:09.000
And just because DDR for like the PlayStation 1 we released that, they only gave us around 2,000 copies.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
And it sold out so fast and they were like, oh, maybe there is a market.

36:12.000 --> 36:18.000
So they threw a few bones here and there and eventually just kind of died out.

36:18.000 --> 36:23.000
And then we think past Supernova, I think the last sort of thing was DDRX.

36:23.000 --> 36:29.000
Which, as far as a gaming engine, it was actually really smooth but the pads were like complete trash.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
Because, I think they went to a new different cabinet designer.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
And just think it picked up by a lot of arcades.

36:35.000 --> 36:41.000
A lot of arcades didn't pick up DDRX2 2014 or X2 versus X3.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
It just kind of flew under the radar.

36:43.000 --> 36:51.000
So it wasn't being at the major anchors like say, D&B or like, the arcade scene was already dying as it was.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
So now we have like this rebirth with say, round one.

36:55.000 --> 37:00.000
And like, I know D&B had a big thing like Handshake I guess with Konami to get their machines.

37:00.000 --> 37:06.000
This was like the most massive release of DDR now in America.

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
I mean, when a lot of people are just like, they gave the game up for dead, they started playing like, oh, this is cool.

37:12.000 --> 37:19.000
And on top of that, now that you have internet ranking for Score Attack, that's where you get a whole bunch of the people back into the game.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
Because, you know, online gaming has been the thing for a long while.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
That's why people play at home, because online gaming, you ain't gotta go anywhere.

37:27.000 --> 37:38.000
As far as getting the freestyle into the whole thing, it's always been one of those things where you kind of had to have someone who was in the scene to help promote and all that kind of stuff.

37:39.000 --> 37:49.000
I guess we just got to the point where we were sick of playing for like 50% of the pot in arcade tokens because, you know, it wasn't as nearly well sponsored.

37:49.000 --> 37:55.000
It was just all there was, you know, I mean, a lot of these freestyle tournaments were a lot of a DIY type effort.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
We did it for love and it was just us, you know, getting together, promoting, helping the community.

38:00.000 --> 38:08.000
But if it wasn't for freestyle tournaments and all that stuff back in 2000, 2001, music gaming would not really be where it is now.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
Because of all those things, that's how Guitar Hero pops off.

38:12.000 --> 38:18.000
That's how companies like Red Octane and all that come up with these things and the harmonics, etc, etc.

38:18.000 --> 38:25.000
So, I mean, if you really think about people like us, you know, you, me, soccer, all that stuff, it's like we kind of started this revolution.

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
I mean, we don't really think about it actively because we don't want to like be on some high horse and like, oh, yeah, I started that.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
But, you know, you ask an outsider, you tell them this story.

38:33.000 --> 38:39.000
This is kind of, you know, this is our footprint on, you know, gaming society as we know it.

38:39.000 --> 38:48.000
Well, you mentioned in there doing it for the love and I have a feeling that is where this event that you're really here to promote kind of comes from is doing it for the love.

38:48.000 --> 38:56.000
So, coming up on January 27th, that's this coming Saturday, you guys are going to be having a tournament at Round 1 in San Jose.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
It is called the DDR Freestyle Takeover Tournament.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
And this is, if I'm correct, this is a freestyle only tournament.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
We're not going to have this. We just had Square Attack this last weekend, right?

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
This is freestyle only, right?

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Freestyle only.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Freestyle only.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
Where did, who started the conversation on, let's bring it back, yo.

39:14.000 --> 39:21.000
This was actually done after a few drinks at California Extreme last summer.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
Aren't the best things after a few drinks.

39:24.000 --> 39:30.000
Yeah, we were just taking a break from all the arcade games and I forget what we were talking about.

39:30.000 --> 39:42.000
I guess just because we were in Bimani Row for a while and we were just talking tournaments and said, hey, you know, with DDRA back being a thing now, we should totally have a tournament because someone just needs a freestyle to Ariana Grande.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
This just needs to happen.

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
Mel, is everybody going to freestyle the Ariana Grande?

39:48.000 --> 39:56.000
I'll tell you this much. There are a couple of us who are judges and we're all doing exhibitions. None of us are doing it.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
Okay. All right. Good to know. Good to know. So the Ariana Grande will be limited.

40:01.000 --> 40:08.000
Oh, you never know. I mean, it could be the next Highs Off You for all we know or like Brilliant To You or Love To Me.

40:08.000 --> 40:14.000
But there are also a lot of other songs there. You can't, I mean, there's Fever. There's some decent songs.

40:14.000 --> 40:32.000
The one thing I will say about DDRA where it kind of missed the boat is, you know, it could have been more R&B like danceable songs because that's where freestyle, a lot of the bread and butter comes with those like 100 to 120 BPM R&B like dance type tracks.

40:32.000 --> 40:40.000
A lot of the music nowadays kind of tends towards like J-core and like the happy hardcore like kind of stuff.

40:40.000 --> 40:49.000
I think that's kind of why Mel, when my buddy JD or anybody else convinces me to get on a DDR machine these days, I'll play Ariana Grande because I kind of have to.

40:49.000 --> 40:57.000
But then like after that, I'm kind of like, I want to go play the old shit. Like I want to go back to Fifth Mix and play Ecstasy. You know what I mean?

40:57.000 --> 41:10.000
Oh, agreed. I mean, after I play, you know, that song to Warm Up, maybe I'll play like something from the X2 or X3 and then I'll go back to like Supernova and play like Ska Ska No. 3 or like Saturday Night Loves.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Because they're just fun.

41:12.000 --> 41:17.000
That could just be us being old too. Back in my day, the music was better. But anyway.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
Wouldn't be wrong. Not by much.

41:20.000 --> 41:28.000
Well, we'll see what kind of music selections, because we don't know what people are going to be picking in advance. They're probably still putting the finishing touches on their freestyles.

41:28.000 --> 41:36.000
It's not too late to join though, right? If somebody still wants to sign up, if they're for whatever reason hearing this and happen to be in the Bay Area and want to get in on this, it's not too late, right?

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
You can, what's the best way? Go to Facebook or search Eventbrite or what?

41:41.000 --> 41:48.000
I'd say the best way to go is go to FreestyleTakeover.com. You have all the information there. It kind of gives us our mission statement.

41:48.000 --> 41:57.000
It'll link you there to our Eventbrite page where you can pre-reg. Or, I mean, if just for whatever reason, you can come the day of the event and register.

41:57.000 --> 42:06.000
But go to FreestyleTakeover.com or you can search us on Facebook at FreestyleTakeover. You can RSVP that you're interested or that you're going.

42:06.000 --> 42:14.000
That's always appreciated too. But yeah, sign up. If you do pre-reg, you get an exclusive competitor swag bag.

42:14.000 --> 42:21.000
So, we're trying to incentivize all this. On top of that, there's going to be some pretty awesome stuff for people who place.

42:21.000 --> 42:33.000
Nice. Yeah, I'm reading here, first place gets 60% of the pot, second place gets 30%, third place gets 10%, but you guys have extra little bonus things getting thrown in too, huh?

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
Extra little. We've seen the swag bag. There's a custom trophy for first place too.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Nice.

42:39.000 --> 42:55.000
Yeah, we're getting hot with it. I mean, the whole thing about this tournament, aside from just sort of trying to revive this community and sort of piggybacking off of the newfound popularity of it, is we're just doing this for all the stuff that we're putting into it.

42:55.000 --> 43:11.000
We're not really getting much help from elsewhere. This is just five dudes who wanted to pump some life into this. Not only do we want the freestyle scene to thrive again because we know how fun it makes the game look.

43:11.000 --> 43:17.000
It's like, think about it, all these people who enter, they could be the next face of freestyle in America, if not the world.

43:17.000 --> 43:32.000
Do you think though that these young bucks, these young new faces of freestyle, may have to compete against some returnees? Do you think some of the folks from back in the day will dust off the shoes and give it one more go?

43:32.000 --> 43:39.000
Any time you dangle a good amount of money in front of them or some sort of tangible prize, they will come out.

43:40.000 --> 43:49.000
I don't profess to follow a lot of sports, but if I'm not mistaken, did some 40-year-old quarterback get another Super Bowl trip today?

43:49.000 --> 44:03.000
As a matter of fact, he did. If you look at a common thread along a lot of the freestylers back in the day, a lot of us, we're just competitive guys by nature. If there's money involved, we're going to bust the ass for it. It doesn't matter what it is.

44:03.000 --> 44:15.000
It could be a card game, it could be a dance game. I think that's the thing about competition and freestyle. It brings out people who are creative and want to go that extra mile for the goods.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
I still have an orange bat.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
Oh, the orange bat of doom. That was a stomp to my beat, right?

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Yes, it was.

44:22.000 --> 44:29.000
If you want to do well, you do want to take some effort to plan out your routine. Don't invent it the day of the contest like a certain co-host.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Hey, ours was pure spite.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
It was fun. We had a good time.

44:33.000 --> 44:43.000
Of course, here at Orange Lawn Radio, not all of our listeners are in Northern California. We have folks coast to coast and even in other countries as well. We're very fortunate to have folks that are worldwide.

44:43.000 --> 45:00.000
I remember back in the day, if you knew a tournament was happening for us, let's say we knew a tournament was happening at 8 on the break on the East Coast or something, we would have to wait for the AVI or the MOV files to be posted on DDRFreak so we could download them and check it out.

45:00.000 --> 45:06.000
Technology has come a long way, hasn't it, Mel? How will folks be able to participate?

45:06.000 --> 45:13.000
We have come a long way since people hosting on their FTP servers. Shout out to Vuju and Eugene.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Shout out.

45:14.000 --> 45:30.000
For the day of the tournament, if you're unable to make it in person, we will be streaming on Twitch. We will have the link on freestyletakeover.com for our channel.

45:30.000 --> 45:46.000
That's awesome because maybe you'll have folks in other parts of the US or maybe even other parts of the world that kind of watch this and go, hey, we missed this too. We need to get together and do a tournament in our neck of the woods. Would you hope that something like that happens?

45:46.000 --> 45:54.000
It'd be awesome. I mean, I don't want this for us to have some sort of monopoly on this. I'm like, yeah, only we can do the freestyle tournaments and all that kind of stuff.

45:54.000 --> 46:04.000
I mean, because if you want something to do well, you want it to do well everywhere, it's not a selfish act by any means.

46:05.000 --> 46:18.000
The only freestyle I can think of for DDR that I know is even out there, there's one team in Japan actually called Team Pandasan. I know they do Pump It Up as well as DDR. Those caps are good.

46:19.000 --> 46:34.000
So yeah, give them Team Pandasan. They still capture the fun and creativity that made people actually download stuff in our DDR fields.

46:34.000 --> 46:42.000
Because if you try to watch a PA tournament, it's funny because you're not really looking at the people, you're just watching the screen to see who slips up, who's the one that gets the great first.

46:42.000 --> 46:50.000
So in a way, it's not a fun thing to look at if you're not even looking at the players. When you're watching freestyle, you are looking at the player. They are the center of attention.

46:50.000 --> 47:02.000
This is where the personalities come out. I think freestyle is just, we're different cats, but in a good way. It's not like where everything PA is not, therefore we're better.

47:02.000 --> 47:12.000
No, we're two different tastes that you can appreciate for different reasons. So that's why when we did Freestyle Takeover, this is absolutely not a slight at Score Attack people.

47:12.000 --> 47:24.000
If not for them, being at the KAC last year, like the guy Chris for Life, he from America won that whole entire thing.

47:24.000 --> 47:38.000
So yeah, we have him and we have the guy Jeff Bunga, who I think he was in third place or something. Those guys brought a lot of shine to the game we've seen out here. I know Chris got his own expose on Polygon and stuff like that.

47:38.000 --> 47:53.000
I don't see the two as competition for each other at all. For me, it's kind of like the DDR tournaments back in the day always had both. So this is kind of like a yin and a yang type of thing. This is bringing back the other half in a way.

47:53.000 --> 48:11.000
Yeah, we have something by having Freestyle and by having Perfect Attack. I think the Score Attack leads to people who are more hardcore DDR fans and want to see that sort of competition, just see the elite people going against each other.

48:11.000 --> 48:21.000
Freestyle is something like, if it's done well, you can just show your friends at work and be like, yeah, this is the goofy stuff that we do. We're about mass appeal and fun.

48:21.000 --> 48:32.000
Nice. Well, I wish you guys the best of luck with the tournament. Again, this is the DDR Freestyle Takeover Tournament. You can check out more information at freestyletakeover.com, including Twitch links the day of the tournament.

48:32.000 --> 48:42.000
It is scheduled to start at round one, three o'clock. That's three o'clock Pacific this Saturday. So if you are around the world, that would be a little bit later or maybe earlier, depending on where you're at.

48:42.000 --> 48:56.000
Again, that's the round one in San Jose at the Eastridge Mall. And I know I'm going to be taking the trip out there to make a cameo, just like the good old days, so I can watch and absorb what's going on. So I can come right back here on this program and talk about it, just like I used to.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
Bring the doctor. Bring the doctor back.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Oh, he got deported back to Canada.

49:01.000 --> 49:09.000
Oh, you mean deported? I figured he would have left on his own terms after, you know, everything that went on in this country.

49:09.000 --> 49:24.000
It was a little bit of both. It was a little bit of both. But like I said, you don't want to come up with routines the day of, and that was always the good doctor's trick. So I don't know. Maybe when you come back for Freestyle Takeover 2019 and I'm 30 pounds lighter, maybe we can talk about that.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Let's make it happen, Captain.

49:26.000 --> 49:37.000
All right. Mel, best of luck to you and everyone involved. I know it's not just you, but you've got a whole team of guys doing that over there. And best of luck to everybody there, and I look forward to seeing it in person this Saturday.

49:38.000 --> 49:44.000
Oh, yeah. Thanks so much for having me. And congrats on your new podcast, for sure.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
So, Mel, is this a return to RTF?

49:49.000 --> 49:58.000
Ooh, now we're getting to exhibit zone where it's like, you know, sub talk, I heard you like returns. So we'll return to return to RTF.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
It would be re-RTF.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
It would be RTRTF.

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
Re-return. Re-return to Freestyle.

50:06.000 --> 50:14.000
Stay tuned. We'll find out. By the way, some comments here over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Muster saying it was nice hearing a bit of DDR history. I miss arcades.

50:14.000 --> 50:21.000
Guess what, Dungeon Muster? Depending on where you're at, they're still there. I mean, round one seems to be doing very well as a chain. They're kind of growing. I hear they're opening up more locations.

50:21.000 --> 50:27.000
Dave and Busters, they're doing pretty well. I know a lot of like throwback retro arcades, especially arcades and bars.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
We have coin op here.

50:28.000 --> 50:39.000
Yeah, like we have coin op here locally, but those those types of things are showing up everywhere. And many of those places have DDR machines, although wouldn't recommend mixing alcohol and DDR, but it's been known to happen.

50:39.000 --> 50:50.000
Hence where my alter ego probably came from in the first place. Oh, and of course, I have to ask this because Orange Right reminded me of this in chat. I can't believe I forgot to ask this question, so I'll end on this.

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
Mel, will Matrix Walks be allowed in the competition?

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
Oh, that is actually one of the rules we specifically addressed and no.

50:59.000 --> 51:12.000
Womp womp. But it's understandable because if you don't know what a Matrix Walk is, you know, remember the movie The Matrix where they would like run up the walls and then kind of, well, there used to be a move where you could actually run up the DDR machine.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
And that was terrible.

51:13.000 --> 51:21.000
Yeah, and it doesn't treat, I mean, it looks impressive the first time you see it, but then you think, oh shit, that machine really shouldn't be kept.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
I would be disappointed if there wasn't at least one caution drop.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
It is an expensive piece of technology.

51:27.000 --> 51:45.000
And if people come down to round one, Eastridge, it's like, you can see just how much music games have evolved with a lot of new machines. I know there's Dance Evolution out there, which I haven't seen very many machines around at all, which is pretty much like Dance Central slash Dance Masters.

51:45.000 --> 51:51.000
Oh yeah, they have like the machine out there and I need someone to play because I think I'm one of two people that play that game.

51:51.000 --> 52:04.000
I've been getting into randomly out here in Rockland in my neck of the woods, they have Neon FM and that's like something, it's kind of like American pop music in a way. That's like a really lazy way to describe it. It's really the best thing I can think of and I've been like kind of into that lately.

52:04.000 --> 52:10.000
Okay, I've heard some like whispers and rumblings that round one may be coming to Sacramento.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
God, I hope so.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
I really hope so.

52:12.000 --> 52:20.000
We just got a place called, I keep wanting to say it's called Punch Drunk Social, but it's like Punch Bowl Social.

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
And it just kind of sounds like Dave and Busters meets the Real Housewives of El Dorado County.

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
So I'm a little confused on it, but I've yet to visit.

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
Do I have to play DDR while balancing a glass of wine in my hand?

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
I would love if we got a round one.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
There's like a Franzia box just right by the machine.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
All right. Hey, we're planning our routine for 2019. Stay tuned.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Franzia box. Yes.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
All right. Mel, thank you so much for coming on the show. I know it was short notice.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
And again, I will see you on Saturday.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
Okay. Glad to see you all. And y'all have a good rest of the evening. Thanks again.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
And everybody, freestyletakeover.com.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
All right. Freestyletakeover.com. We'll see you on Saturday. Thanks again, Mel.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Thanks. You have a great one.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
You too.

53:04.000 --> 53:10.000
Good old Mel B from episode six to episode seven hundred and fifteen.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
There he is talking about freestyle all these years later.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
Hey, I am all for that. So you got to you got to bring in the old and bring in the new,

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
which is kind of, you know, coming off the heels of I just mentioned,

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
just launched episode one of a new podcast tonight.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
So hopefully this one lasts a little longer than Pokestop did.

53:27.000 --> 53:32.000
But sometimes you get one that goes a long time.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
Sometimes you don't. But I wish nothing but the best for this.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
I think Monday Comics Mania made it five episodes. You went longer than that.

53:39.000 --> 53:43.000
Maybe. Yeah. But I did make make a friend through that podcast.

53:43.000 --> 53:48.000
Yeah. Because we had Todd Stashwick on the show.

53:48.000 --> 53:53.000
Now he's like really successful with 12 Monkeys on sci fi.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
And he had been on The Riches, but I always remembered him from Supernatural.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
Yeah. When I did The Horde House show for a long time with you guys know Grandpa,

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
Next Fur and Shane, we did The Horde House. That one lasted a good 130 some odd episodes.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
That was a pretty good run for Horde House.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
I got we got some people that were like really into the Blizzard games,

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
like World of Warcraft that kind of came over here to OLR because of it.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
So, you know, just girl, you mentioned the wow.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
Well, I guess we should talk about our gaming weeks.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
What a nice transition into the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

54:23.000 --> 54:28.000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week? I started on wow again.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
And apparently I had a demon hunter on Proudmoore,

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
but I'm in some guild and I think it's one Shane added me to.

54:35.000 --> 54:41.000
So I we need we need our guild. We need to make our guild.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I want to talk about wow in a minute.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
OK. All right.

54:44.000 --> 54:50.000
But I also remembered I had like my troll named Einaj, who was backwards of Jaina.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
So she was fun.

54:52.000 --> 54:59.000
But yeah, I think it was also the same server I had Gyaru on my my elf pretty bitch.

54:59.000 --> 55:05.000
Anyway, so I played well, did Legion stuff because I had my my demon hunty.

55:05.000 --> 55:10.000
And then I have been playing.

55:10.000 --> 55:17.000
Really, not a lot, just Pokemon ingress when I feel like walking.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
What else did I play? Oh, yeah, I'm playing Animal Crossing.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
Of course, because it's adorbs.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
Didn't they finally announced they're adding like clothing customization?

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
Yeah, they actually you can craft clothes now.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Abel and Mabel, are they back?

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
It's not customization yet. They give you outfits you can craft.

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
And like crafting five outfits will give you like 10 leaf leaf tickets.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
So that's not bad.

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
They have like Rovers Garden rally or whatever.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
And then you catch butterflies and you get all these achievements for butterfly catching.

55:50.000 --> 55:56.000
And it's kind of fun. You know, I've just been I'm level 56 now.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
So and of course, I'm still playing Miitomo, kind of.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
All right. That's it.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
All right. My gaming week. So I also played WoW for a little bit.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
But here's the thing. I don't like that new patch. They put out a new patch on Tuesday.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
I'm not a fan. Have you tried to go back and do any old content, Jamie?

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Not yet.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
The old I first thing I did was I did a dungeon because I was working on my shaman on my alliance side.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
And the first thing I did was I rolled into a dungeon.

56:19.000 --> 56:26.000
And it wasn't like like I get that the dungeons before were pretty face roll, but they kind of amped it up like too much.

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
And it was just taking too much time to get through stuff.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
And of course, the other people in the party weren't used to it.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
So nobody's doing crowd control or that stuff because you didn't have to before.

56:35.000 --> 56:40.000
Like, unfortunately, I kind of feel like it went from one extreme to another and it just wasn't very fun.

56:40.000 --> 56:49.000
And so meanwhile, while all of that is going on, you know, I did some kind of did a lot of thinking on Final Fantasy 14 and kind of what I was doing in that game.

56:49.000 --> 57:01.000
And I made a really tough decision to actually transfer servers in Final Fantasy 14 to kind of see if I could get reinvigorated for the game there, which sucks because I really enjoyed the group that I was playing with before.

57:01.000 --> 57:14.000
But because unfortunately, one big thing I love 14, but one massive thing that it lacks that WoW does better is the fact in is that in WoW, it doesn't really matter what servers your friends are on.

57:14.000 --> 57:23.000
At the end of the day, if I really want to play with somebody who happens to be on another server in the same country, there still is a wall with the Europe servers and the Asian servers and all that.

57:23.000 --> 57:28.000
But if I want to play with one of my friends on whatever server, we can dungeon together, we can raid together.

57:28.000 --> 57:35.000
And Final Fantasy 14 is starting to get there. It got mostly there the last patch, but the problem is there's still two different data centers.

57:35.000 --> 57:41.000
So I had some really good friends of mine and we've promoted their podcast here on this show before. They do a show called Astral Era.

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
And I've been wanting to play with those guys for a long, long time. Things were really slowing down on the old server.

57:46.000 --> 57:53.000
So I was like, all right, I'm going to make a really tough choice and I'm going to say, I'm going to go over here and play with my Astral Era buddies for a little while.

57:53.000 --> 58:00.000
And I'm just going to hope and I'm going to cross my fingers that at some point, Square Enix is able to get their servers the way WoW is and I can play with my old friends again.

58:00.000 --> 58:06.000
And I don't have to make tough choices like these. But for now, that's what I did. And it's tough, it's tough.

58:06.000 --> 58:14.000
But in some ways it did kind of reinvigorate 14 for me. So yes, I'm still paying for two MMOs.

58:15.000 --> 58:22.000
I'm going to keep giving WoW, especially now that you're playing WoW again. And I think the Game Buoy guys are checking out WoW again.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
So I have reasons to kind of go back and give that another chance.

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
Does this mean I can't go back and roll old dungeons and just plow through them, though?

58:29.000 --> 58:40.000
At first, no. And they screwed some stuff up. Like, you couldn't even go hunting for mounts in old raids because the old raids would sync up to your level.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
You pick it now?

58:42.000 --> 58:48.000
I think, supposedly, I haven't checked, but they were supposed to do a patch that fixed a lot of that on Friday.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
Because definitely a lot of players weren't happy about that.

58:51.000 --> 58:58.000
Because I was basically just rolling through those old dungeons trying to get the achievements out of them.

58:58.000 --> 59:06.000
You know, now that I can, I mean, me and, I don't think it was me and John, it was me and someone else.

59:06.000 --> 59:11.000
Just went in and we were plowing through all of the Warlords stuff.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
And that's fun to do, you know?

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
Once we hit, like, rating level, we could go plow through them, you know?

59:16.000 --> 59:23.000
Yeah, you steamroll it, but at the same time you get to see elements of the story that you might have missed because you haven't been paying for the game for 12 years straight.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Or, however, 13 years straight, or however long that game's been around.

59:25.000 --> 59:31.000
So, anyway, so hopefully the WoW patch stuff, again, I haven't checked it out since Tuesday, the day the patch came out.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
I understand they've done some fixes, so I am going to give it a second shot.

59:34.000 --> 59:40.000
Because, of course, I got billed for my month, like, the day before the patch hit, so I still have time to make a decision on that.

59:40.000 --> 59:46.000
But now I'm juggling two MMOs, and I'm still trying to play stuff in between as well, but I'm still super into Heroes of the Storm.

59:46.000 --> 59:52.000
Like, I was actually watching a competitive competition on Heroes of the Storm the other day, because I'm starting to understand the game a lot better.

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
I still mostly stick to AI, but, like, I'm finding so many heroes that I enjoy playing.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I'll play with you again, because I've got, I was playing Illidan for a while, which, he dies squishy, you know, which is weird.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
But he's a lot of fun, and I think I just unlocked Sylvanas.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Yeah. Well, and if you haven't played in a long time, you probably never redeem the thing where you just get 20 heroes for free.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Probably.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
So there's, like, a ton of stuff you can get. Yeah, definitely check it out.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Okay, because, I mean, now that I'm playing, you know, I want to get back into playing more stuff more often.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Yeah, cool.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:29.000
And I actually mentioned today and today that I wanted to bust out the Dreamcast and finish my Grandia 2, for one thing.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Which, I was so happy with that game, it's one of the few that the Japanese save files will work on the American game.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000
So, because I'd already gotten, like, a third through the game on the Japanese version.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I don't talk a lot about the mobile gaming stuff that I do, but I think it's worth a shout out that I did participate in the Pokémon GO Community Day yesterday.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Because once a month they do these community days for Pokémon GO, so I have friends that play that.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
They don't play, you know, Ingress that we were talking about last week, but they play Pokémon GO.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:06.000
And so we all went downtown. We were a little worried because they had the huge march downtown yesterday, too.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:14.000
But that was all kind of on the west side of the capital, so it left the east side of the capital to be the Wailmer Farms slash Shiny Pikachus.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And I caught four Shiny Pikachus yesterday because, you know, every lure or every stop at the capital was lured up and Pikachus were showing up everywhere.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And I think all three of us that did that together yesterday really agreed. That was a really cool, like, thing that Niantic did.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And it seems like they're going to be doing this more. They're going to do it once a month. And I think that's great.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I had a great time yesterday just going out and taking a walk around the capital and playing cell phone games with people I don't always get to play cell phone games with because we don't always play the same thing.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:54.000
So, yeah, I had a lot of fun. So, kudos to Niantic. I know I give them a lot of shit sometimes on the show, but I thought the community event was a lot of fun.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I just hope the next one isn't Shiny Pikachu again, but I don't think it will be.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I hope it is because I missed it.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Well, the good news is Shiny Pikachus didn't get deleted. It's just that the odds of getting one yesterday were really good. Like, you know, again, I caught four out of maybe the 120.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I wish that they would, like, bring in trading.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Yeah, because I'd happily trade you one. So because I also got Kyogre yesterday. That made me very happy, although I had I got I was getting so frustrated at Kyogre.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I was like, Shane, you keep catching him. You do it. And he used my phone and he caught it. So technically, Shane caught the Kyogre for me, but I don't care. It's mine.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, actdef says it needs to be more hours. I was actually busy during the time the event was. Yeah, that's the number one complaint I'm hearing is that it was only like a three hour event and it should have been a little longer.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:56.000
And so, yeah, I kind of agree with that. And rawcat in chat says I got no Shiny Pikachu. Well, the good news isn't the same thing I'm telling DarkSakura is that Shiny Pikachus didn't go away. You could still get one.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.000
It's just the odds are still kind of odds are going to be a little yucky. But Shinies are Shinies are supposed to be a little special.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:18.000
SSG100Matt in chat, ouch, ouch, says my girlfriend caught seven shiny Pikachus. I got zero. Well, sorry to hear that, buddy. Hopefully trading opens up for you, too. There you go.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:26.000
All right. Well, I just caught a Nidoran in your bathroom. Congratulations. Thank you for getting him out of the bathroom.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.000
It was a lady. How dare you assume gender. Thank you for getting in the bathroom. And look, the bitch ran, so whatever.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.000
All right. Let's get into I don't think I have any other announcements here. We still have plenty of shows coming up next week on the show.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Definitely. I'll be talking about the DDR tournament next week. And yeah, I'm going on a trip in March, but that's still like two months away.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:52.000
But that's all booked, signed, sealed, delivered. I'm going on a jet plane. I'm going to Atlanta off season.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I'm not going for Dragon Con. I'm going for other stuff. I'm going to Drag Con. Are you? I wish you'd go to Dragon Con someday.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:08.000
It's so much fun. I got to get I got to get Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling, which, by the way, shout out to that show because they had me on as a guest this past week.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I forgot to shout them out earlier, but shout out Starboard Power Coupling. We got to talk about Star Trek Discovery.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:21.000
The first two episodes back from the break. So that was a lot of fun because I had some things to say about it, especially especially the big twist in that first episode.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I had some things to say about that. So anyway, but I don't want to spoil for those I haven't seen yet because some people are waiting to binge it when it's all out.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:35.000
They're going to get CBS all access in February and binge the whole thing, which makes sense. Anyway, you have to check out Starboard Power Coupling if you want to hear.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Let's get in some more gaming news. We have plenty of gaming news going on this week. It's a it's kind of a quiet week, but not really.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000
We still had we still had stuff here and there. So Jamie's going to start us off. Well, we're getting Forza Fable. Kidding.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Basically, Playground Games, who did Forza Horizon, is working on a Fable title.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:02.000
So it is in new hands and hopefully won't, you know, suck. Fable 3 was not great.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I'm just saying I didn't hate it. I didn't like it either. But Fable 2 was great.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Yeah. Yeah. It's like it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I love Forza Horizon. Forza Horizon is probably like my favorite Xbox exclusive thing. Like it's just it's a great racing, but it feels more arcadey.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:27.000
See, there's racing sims and like racing arcade and Forza Horizon is a great racing arcade game. And I really enjoy it.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Now, of course, people are going to think that means, oh, then this means that they're going to bring cars into Fable.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Well, they might, but at the same time, can't a developer do different genres?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I would bet that a lot of those types of studios probably get really bored of making the same thing over and over,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:51.000
which is why they eventually hand it off to someone else. Hence how Mass Effect got ruined for Jamie and I.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
So sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't work.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Well, at any rate, they're saying that it's not going to be out very soon.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Playgrounds has a new office in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. So this is being developed in the UK.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Once they've got their people hired, then they're looking to start development at that point,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:27.000
which I hope it doesn't fall into, you know, development hell, you know, and then get canceled.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Like, what was it? Fable Legends?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Yeah, Fable Legends was that whole I think it was gonna be free to play or something.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
And it kind of it showed up one E3 and then it fizzled out, which was really sad for Lionhead games,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
because, you know, you don't like to...

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Lionhead is no more now.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Yeah, I know it's I know it's but I don't like people losing their jobs.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
No, not at all.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Hopefully they got hired by these guys or somewhere else.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Possibly. But at any rate, you know, the last time we had a Fable game was Fable anniversary in 2014.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
It's been a long time.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Well, four years.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Yeah, but Fable anniversary was just like a rebranding of older stuff.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I don't think it was anything new, new.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Looking in chat, by the way, talking about studios going from one genre to another,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Dungeon Buster points out in chat at live.vognetwork.com,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Guerrilla Games did nothing but Killzone for years.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Then they made Cyber Monster Hunter, a.k.a. Horizon Zero Dawn,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000
which was obviously a huge thing on the PlayStation 4.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
So, yeah, that's been like a game of the year for a lot of people.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Going back to read some other comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
SSJ100Matt talking about the Pokemon Community Day saying,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
We had a huge turnout in Central Park, at least a couple hundred.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
There were a lot of people from the Silph Road community there.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Yeah, I follow Silph Road.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I'm kind of more of an observer there over on Reddit.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I know they have a huge Reddit and they do really good at kind of digging in

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
what changes with the different patches and things like that.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
But I didn't really participate in any sort of official meetup like that,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
although I'm sure they were doing something here in Sacramento, I'm sure,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
where our show is based.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Dungeon Buster also continuing about Fable saying,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Fable was neat. It had its issues as a series,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
but I'm interested to see how this new Fable might turn out.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
And then Ragenator in chat says,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Forza plus Fable equals Forzable.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
That might be one way to name it, I suppose.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Bobby Black Wolf saying that one of the games he actually completed was Fable 2.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:33.000
That is definitely an accomplishment knowing that Bobby Black Wolf

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
actually went and beat your game, that's for sure.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000
So, let's talk a little bit about, speaking of remakes and things of that sort,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I want to talk about Disgaea, Hour of Darkness.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Apparently Disgaea, Hour of Darkness is getting an HD remake

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
for its 15th anniversary.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
This was announced in a Nippon Ichi stream

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
that they are going to be doing a Disgaea, Hour of Darkness HD remake.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
There's no gameplay footage out or anything like that,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
but Nippon Ichi did announce a release window of this summer.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Disgaea, of course, the original was a PlayStation 2 game.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
It was on the PSP, you know, pour one out for the PSP.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
It was on the Nintendo DS, and at one point it was on the PC.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
So, we don't have screenshots, we don't have release dates,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
we don't have anything like that,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:24.000
but Disgaea is going to be the next game getting a PC remake.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
So, were you a fan of Disgaea, Dark Sakura?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Not really. I didn't play it.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:38.000
It was around that time when I was just really not into as many games of that type,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
but Disgaea had a big following, so I'm sure fans will be pleased to find a new version.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
It's one of those things where I played it a little bit on the PlayStation 2,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
but, you know, gaming ADD, I never really got around to finishing it,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
and then there were all these sequels.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
So, this will be a good chance to go back and give it another go,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
which hopefully makes sense.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Yeah, no problem there.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
So, I have news for people who are like me,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:11.000
who like to play games on their PC or Mac,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:18.000
although I planned on getting Dragon Ball FighterZ on PlayStation 4.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.000
This is for people who are going to be playing it on PC,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
and let you know what you're going to need for your requirements.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
So, I figured I'd go ahead and do y'all a favor and give you the stuff.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
So, at the very minimum, you do need to be at lowest Windows 7,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:42.000
have an AMD FX4350 4.2 gigahertz Intel Core i5.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Sorry, brain.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Or an Intel Core i5 at minimum 3.2 gigahertz, 4 gigabytes of RAM.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Graphics card recommended minimum Radeon HD 6870 with 1 gig of RAM,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000
or GeForce GTX 650 Ti.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
That was actually my last graphics card.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I upgraded mine about six months ago with 1 gigabyte DirectX 11,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
and of course the DirectX compatible sound card or onboard chipset.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Recommended, it actually doesn't look like,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
it's going to want a faster processor,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.000
but it's really not looking for anything great graphics card wise,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
like it's saying a GeForce GTX 660.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
That's not terrible.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I mean, that's a few years old.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
So, yeah, they're saying older computers are going to be able to run it.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
It really did surprise me just how modest the requirements are,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
you know, by terms of what people have now,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:49.000
so I could only think of how much better it would play on a higher end system.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I mean, and it's using Unreal 4 for its graphics engine,

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
and it's the same one that Street Fighter V uses,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000
or Tekken 7, which also look really, really good on a PC.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:09.000
So, I think I might eventually pick it up on PC when price drops,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
but I'm going to play it on PS4, because I can use my,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
we've got arcade controllers for PS4, like fighting controllers.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Sure, got to be authentic.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Some people in chat wondering how serious you might take this.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Tigerclaw in chat saying Dragon Ball Fighter Z is no doubt going to be huge in the fighting game tournaments.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
So, maybe it's time to practice it, because perhaps someday you'll become the Dragon Ball Fighter Z champion.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
You want to know what?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Or Dragon Ball fighters. Are you supposed to say Fighter Z or fighters?

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
It's Fighter Z from what I understand.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Okay.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:48.000
But I am not, the last tournament that I was in that had nothing to do with DDR was Bust-A-Move 2.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Which is kind of adjacent in a way.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Well, and on top of that, it was the one where they gave me a busted controller that they replaced after I got eliminated.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I had been playing in mix mode before that for like an hour, and no one could beat me. So, just saying.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Nice.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I think this was at, wasn't it fun? It was at an AX. It was at an anime expo, so it was a while back.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I think I did some tournament at Magfest. Somebody talked me into doing it. I don't know if I did Smash or something.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
It was something I wasn't even good at.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I'm not really competitive by nature, I guess. I mean, I get competitive, but I more participate in things just because I'll have fun doing it.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Yeah.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I don't care about winning.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
But the competition can be fun.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:36.000
That part's not fun for me. I'm not a competitor. The only person I like to compete against is myself.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Okay.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And so, and I don't like a whole lot of attention on me, you know? I mean, yeah, I may be kind of vocal and loud when it comes to being on a podcast or being on social media, but in person, you know, I don't really like that much attention on me.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Well, but this is also like for, you know, podcasting in general can be an outlet of sorts for a lot of people. Like, just, you know, the way I am on here may not always reflect exactly.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Like, I think in real life, I might be a lot more quiet until I get to know you and then I open up.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Girl.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
No, well, it just depends.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Sometimes.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:22.000
You haven't seen me around people I don't know. I kind of go like, ooh. But, you know, I also tell people, like, if you see me at a convention or something like that, I'm a normal fucking person.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Just come up and say hi, you know, as long as you're not creepy, like it's in which most people aren't.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:35.000
So, you know, just say hi. I'm, you know, and I always am flattered when people recognize me from this whole thing. So, yeah.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000
But sometimes I worry that I might come off as guarded or something because I don't talk a lot unless I like know the situation.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I know the people. So, wow. That got off topic from that original chat.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
It sure did.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Off topic on this show, you don't say. Well, let's talk about competition because this is something that I didn't really get a chance to get into last week.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Because a lot of people were talking about it last week and now a lot of people are talking about it this week.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Obviously, we were focused on Ingress and our guests that were here last week. So, we didn't really get a chance to talk about the Overwatch League.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:13.000
So, the Overwatch League launched last week and it made a come – it kind of came back in the news.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
I don't want to say it made a comeback because it's kind of – a lot of people are like super into Overwatch League.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I've been seeing a lot of tweets about it and so forth.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:27.000
If for whatever reason you don't know what Overwatch League is, it's basically a big push by Blizzard to get Overwatch, you know, more into esports.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:38.000
But to be more akin to what you would see in a league that's like a NFL type of league or an NBA or a traditional, if you will, sports league.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Overwatch League, I believe the vision there is to kind of do a hybrid.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And – well, let me get into the story and then I'll get into some of my thoughts here.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:53.000
So, a story that's making its way around the internet this week and many people have actually seen this video.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
The Overwatch League did end up suspending a player this week.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Dallas Fuel had their player xQc, whose name is Felix.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:11.000
He was suspended by the league and by Fuel because what he did, he actually said something that wasn't too nice on a Twitch stream of his.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I believe he said something around the fact that this other player who goes by Muma, who's on another team, the Houston Outlaws.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
So, there's kind of that whole Texas rivalry, I guess, thing going on.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.000
It was basically something like, go suck a fat cock, but you might like that type of thing.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000
And so, it just – it was kind of – well, it wasn't kind of. It was shitty.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Like, I don't know how to say it.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
I was actually going to try to find – I wanted to find the video. I thought I had the –

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Well, depending on where that cock's been, literally.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I was going to try to find the video here, but unfortunately, I thought I had linked myself to it.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Well, let me ask you this. Before not considering this story here, let me ask Jamie this to buy me a little time while I find this video so you can draw your own conclusion.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.000
What do you think about the concept of Overwatch League? Not considering this part of it, what do you think about the concept of the Overwatch League?

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:10.000
If they have fun doing it, sure. You know? I have no problem with that.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I have no problem with being competitive or forming, you know, teams to play Overwatch. If they have fun doing it that way, good for them.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:29.000
You know? And it did harm none. Do what you will. You know? But when you start harming other people in it, then that's when it becomes too much.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Okay. Here's the clip. I finally found it. So, judge for yourself what's happening here.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
So, this is, again, xQc live on his stream.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Get fucked! I don't play, bitch! I fucking smoked it, dude. No. No. He didn't smoke shit. Shut your fucking mouth. Go back there. Suck a fat cock. I mean, he would like it, but...

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
That's not a thing. That's not a thing, dude. Please.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Now, what you kinda can't see...

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And it's my line, too. Like, what?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:14.000
What you kinda can't see happening there is that once those words left his mouth, his jaw kinda dropped and he kinda had that moment of like, oh, fuck.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:23.000
You know, like, I probably shouldn't have said that. So, like, for me, I'm kinda getting that, like, instant, like, he had this moment like, oh, shit, I shouldn't have said that.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:31.000
And my understanding is that the other player involved in this, Muma, did say in his own videos that, like, he kinda just doesn't give a fuck type of thing.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Like, he's, you know, probably focused on the game or whatever and he's, him and this guy have kinda buried the hatchet.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:47.000
But the league in its response was immediate. They, you know, before the next match, they ended up suspending this player for a game and I think he got a $2,000 fine, it was.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And then, actually, the team, the Dallas Fuel came out and said, we support what the Overwatch League did and actually, we're gonna bench him until Stage 2 starts in early February.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.000
And some people, you know, that's where the debate is. Was this punishment too harsh? Was, you know, are we overreacting, da da da?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:13.000
And, you know, I have to say, in one hand, it does kinda suck for the dude because I do see that he kinda has that remorse, you know, like, instantly.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Or at least, that's kinda, you know, what I'm taking away from it when I'm watching this.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:24.000
But at the same time, dude, like, in the beginning of that clip, before he gets that, he's running his mouth constantly, right?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.000
And he's, like, doing all these different voices. Like, he's got, like, verbal diarrhea or something.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And, like, I get to do, like, a Twitch stream. You have to be entertaining sometimes, but you have to be very careful about the things that come out of your mouth.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And obviously, you know, this guy recognizes it. He has, you know, written some tweets on it since. He crossed a line.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And the problem here is, is that you are representing Overwatch and you are representing this league.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
And you did, you know, a negative thing, so this is the punishment.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:03.000
So, at least I will give to this guy's credit. He does seem to, I wanna say man up, but woman up or, you know, person up.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Or maybe just be an adult.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Yes, he's being an adult and accepting his licks and we're hopefully all gonna be able to move on from this.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
If only other people could follow suit, you know?

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Right. So, and here's my thing. And I gotta go back to talking about Overwatch League a little bit in general.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Because I'm glad the league responded as fast as they did.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Because maybe it goes to show that this kind of talk isn't really acceptable in their game either.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Because I think we all know that Overwatch has a pretty toxic community right now.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:42.000
So, I hope maybe this little slap kind of goes to show that Blizzard is taking some of this seriously and doesn't wanna see it in their game either.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
And so I'm kinda glad that, you know, they smacked down the representative.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Do I think, you know, I think we live in a day and age where I think there might be some people about this guy that made the remarks that he should be ruined.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
He's trash. He should get fired and all this stuff.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:02.000
And I'm like, not everything has to be black or white or A or B.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I don't think this guy needs to get fired or anything like that.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:13.000
But I do think, which seems to be the case what he's doing, he's taking his licks and he needs to take this moment to go, maybe I should watch my mouth.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:23.000
I will say on a personal level, it would make me really reluctant to want to be around this person or pay any more attention to what they do.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Because you now know that when that thought comes out in a moment of not thinking, right, that's what's inside them.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:39.000
That is how that person is. And yes, maybe they are garbage inside, you know.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
We have a lot of garbage in public places.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Sure.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:58.000
You know, and yes, he could be a complete garbage human being, but he should still be treated as fairly as anybody else who let something out or makes a mistake.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.000
You know, I especially will, you know, with what's going on in Hollywood right now.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Yeah, I've called out a lot of people saying they're garbage.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000
And when their reputation is part of their business, then, yeah, ruin them.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
That's perfectly fine. That's their personal business.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:25.000
There's a difference between somebody like Harvey Weinstein, who has profited off of like disgusting shit repeated over the years, over and over and built a culture.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
There's a big difference between him and that guy is garbage.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
There's a difference between him and this guy who says, go suck a dick, you might like it.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
You know, he said a dumb shit thing.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:43.000
If he recognizes I did a garbage thing and can own up to it, then you know what? Fine. We can all get past it.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:52.000
That's the part that gives me some hope. The fact that he copped to it and is taking his punishment like an adult.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:00.000
You know, people who whine and try to say, oh, I never did it. It didn't happen or deny it or say I don't care.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Those people are even bigger pieces of garbage.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Now, some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, I've watched entertaining streamers based on that sample alone.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000
That's not someone I'd watch. Then that's kind of where I'm at too.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:22.000
ActDeftInChat says, XQC's gotten in trouble before. Do you remember the guy that got banned for reporting one tricks? It's the same guy.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.000
And he got in trouble not for the reports, but for abusing the system and not using it properly.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.000
As Joan Hunter-Matt says, there's a huge problem with people taking things too far in the competitive esports gaming community.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:39.000
The fighting game community is a prime example. Things have gotten better, but it spans all esports and we still have a ways to go.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I'm kind of glad you pointed that out because that brings me back to some of my thoughts on the Overwatch League as a whole.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Because I did watch that first day of matches. And I have to admit, I'm just going to be honest here.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:55.000
But let me finish my thought before you cut me off with your response. Because I know a lot of you are very hardcore in the Overwatch League here.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:02.000
So when I first was watching the Overwatch League, I think I was watching the San Francisco Shock, which is like our local team or whatever you want to say.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Was playing, and I don't even remember what team they were playing at this point, but I remember it was the San Francisco Shock or whatever their first match was.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I was watching some of that. And I thought the production value of it was really good.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:23.000
I did think the commentators were doing a good job. I thought they made it kind of look like Overwatch as an NFL thing.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000
You were able to see things that you wouldn't necessarily see in the game, like overhead maps.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I thought the commentators did a good job talking about strategies and why things looked a certain way.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:38.000
I thought the arena was a really kick-ass setup. And I thought to be there live was probably a pretty exciting thing.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
All that being said, there were a few things that kind of struck me.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And one of them was that I was like, but these guys, the San Francisco Shock, how many of them are actually from San Francisco or actually play in San Francisco?

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:01.000
And if I'm to understand, all of these teams are in LA playing at this one arena that they have.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.000
So what really separates these teams at the end of the day? They're owners, right?

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
So there's a part of me that's kind of like, well, that's silly.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Like, why do they all have these different branding in the city?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:19.000
However, before you all cut me off, like I said, I've come to understand since then that this is like the goal.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Blizzard wants to be there next year or the year after.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:28.000
So maybe this having it all in kind of one place is kind of like the first step.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.000
And then maybe in 2019, we'll see home and away games and things of that nature.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
So I can accept that. You know what?

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000
As a league that's got to grow and got to kind of prove its success to its investors.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Okay, you know what? Fine.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000
You know, if that Blizzard arena that they have is going to be a template for other things, then cool.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
But here's the thing I'm not convinced on yet with Overwatch League.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:26:00.000
And it goes back to when they first rolled out that commercial at BlizzCon last year.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
I think it was 2016, actually. It would have been 2016 because it took a little while for the league to get going.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
And I remember the commercial was like, you know, it was showing this faceless name.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.000
And it was like, you train hard. You skill up. You do good. You get hired by a league.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
You get a salary. You do this. You do that. No, no.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
And it kind of had that feeling of like, you can do this.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000
If you are a good enough Overwatch player, you too could be a part of the Overwatch League.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And so, to my surprise, when I'm watching all of these teams play, there's something that's kind of missing.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Anyone want to guess what it is that isn't really very reflective of our society and all the yous that could be out there playing?

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Women. There's no women in the Overwatch League.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000
And I'm sorry, that's a problem. That's a big problem.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.000
And look, here's the thing. I've heard all this shit.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I'm aware of the Kotaku article about the Korean lady that does a really good Zarya.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.000
My understanding is she doesn't really want to be editorialized as somebody in this whole context or whatever.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.000
But why isn't she on a team? She's a really good Overwatch player.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And the teams are coming out with, oh, but the co-ed housing. Oh, but they might date.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Oh, but it just isn't the right moment type of thing.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I'm going to quote the great, astounding, and wonderful philosopher of our time, RuPaul Charles.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I'm going to quote RuPaul from Season 7, Episode 3 of RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
I don't want to hear any more goddamn excuses. Anymore.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Where are the fucking women?

01:27:50.000 --> 01:28:01.000
It's that simple. Like, you mean to tell me out of 133 people or something that are playing in this league, there wasn't one woman?

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And I'm sorry, but it's not, I don't want a fucking token either.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Like, out of 133 players, there should be, I mean, if it were to really accurately reflect our society, it should be like half, right?

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:24.000
But fuck, I think many of us would be happy if there were like 13. 13 women. 10%. Let's start there. Is that too much to ask?

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.000
You mean to tell me out of all the great players in the world, you can't find 10% that are women?

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I think we need to ask ourselves, if we want to be taking ourselves seriously, we need to ask ourselves, why aren't women getting committed to Overwatch?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Could it be because of behavior like what we just discussed here a minute ago?

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I'd say that's a likely reason, but honestly, when we're still dealing with a patriarchal society, you know, this is just another symptom of the disease.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:02.000
I'm sorry, patriarchy is a disease. And it is ruining everything until we dismantle it.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:11.000
So whereas I will give Overwatch props for setting this precedent and what they're gonna do, you know, with taking action on this negativity,

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:17.000
and maybe that will make the Overwatch League feel more welcoming and maybe more people will train in all this stuff.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Miss me with this fucking co-ed, they're gonna date shit. That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I'm sorry, I've never dated a co-worker.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:34.000
And some people have and it's fine, but I don't want to hear any fucking excuses. Not interested in them.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:45.000
So until the Overwatch League can more accurately reflect what they promised in the beginning, you, I'm not so sure I can get as excited about it.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:51.000
But you know what? The minute the League starts to correct some of these things, I'll be the first one to put on a jersey.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I do, I do wish them well. I hope they can get there. I feel like if anything can do it, this might be able to do it.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.000
But this is a problem that they're gonna have to solve before they can get there.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
And that's my opinion.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
No argument for me.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Over at chat, I haven't even looked at chat. Over at live.vog and network.com, let's see.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000
SSG100Matt says, I know women who play Overwatch and they do get harassed mercifully.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.000
If I was being harassed for my gender, et cetera, why would I play and be a part of that community? To me, that's not fun.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Let's see.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:34.000
BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, I dated a co-worker, but it was in college and we both happened to work at the same dorm front desk.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:42.000
ActDeft in chat says, I actually do understand where the League and the teams are coming from, especially since this does happen on regular sports.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
It's not about gender norms. It's about performance.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Look, I know we have-

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I hear excuse.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
I know. Respectfully, ActDeft, I hear excuse.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
And my point is-

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
It's the same excuse men have been saying for an age.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:06.000
If we want to really take this further, we have to get past the normal because the normal doesn't work in this context.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Does that make sense? I hope.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000
And on top of that, that doesn't even apply.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Well, and here's my thought too.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Okay, we have one out gay player in the League. Cool. You know what? That's awesome.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And I applaud that guy for being out and, you know, just doing his thing and just being a gay Overwatch player who's really awesome.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:33.000
That's great, but I would doubt he's the only one who's actually gay.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.000
So, there's probably Overwatch players who are already dating.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Just like, there's probably NFL players who are dating.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000
And there's NBA players who are dating.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
But they're not out with it. Why?

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Because we as a society haven't figured out how to handle that appropriately yet.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:32:05.000
And unfortunately, people are afraid that if such and such NFL player comes out as gay and in a relationship or whatever, it's going to be lost dollars from homophobes who purchase jerseys.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Here's the other thing too.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:18.000
In a case of something that's typically male dominated, and I may be off base, but I was not too long ago looking up numbers about this.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:25.000
A gay man is going to be more accepted than a woman. At all. In a male dominated field.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
That's just how it is.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:43.000
And so, I think that there's still going to be those struggles, but at the end of the day, it's another guy who is going to still fall into, I've got male privilege on my side.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.000
And the women are going to be overlooked. That's just how it is.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:54.000
You know, we're talking a lot about women, but I'm sure there's a lot Overwatch League can do racially as well.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Indeed.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I want to make sure this is very clear. This isn't about ticking boxes or things like that.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Tokenism is never the answer.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Bingo. This is about, you have to ask yourself, why aren't more women getting involved in sports?

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Or why aren't these other, you know, this more global community getting more involved with it?

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
You have to answer those questions.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:25.000
And then once you answer those questions, which I kind of think SSJ gave you a big hint there earlier when he was talking about how, you know, women that play Overwatch tend to get treated like shit type of thing.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Once you can kind of get that, then the rest of that's going to fall into place.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:35.000
You know what we should do? We need an all female league.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I don't think that's the answer.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Lear me out.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Okay. Fair enough. Go ahead.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Where, you know, and by female, I am being trans inclusive.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Sure.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:58.000
If you are, if you identify as a woman, this is for you and have all male voices silenced in it just for like a year and watch them perform well and watch them do great.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And I think that that right. And then make the offer.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Shall we combine?

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.000
There was a pretty good piece out there that was kind of against the idea of the separate female league.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:20.000
And I kind of tend to agree with it because this is just something where it just needs to happen, where it's all in one and computer games should not be limited by, you know, gender one way or the other.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I mean, that's just I totally I get I get what you're saying, Jamie, from a whole like make them feel what we feel type of standpoint.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.000
And to be fair to Overwatch League, I haven't put this out there yet, and I really should.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
I do notice there's women on the stage supporting.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I think they have women commentators.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I didn't hear one and what I was tokenism.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
OK, that's just a token effort.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
It's to appease people.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.000
You know, there is and this is a slight sidetrack, but it has to do with this.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.000
There's a book that I'm reading right now called Man Made Language by an Australian scholar named Dale Spender.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
She's intelligent.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000
It's a college thesis is what it reads like.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:08.000
But she goes into during the suffrage movement, how the women had a big conference and men were invited.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000
But the moment a man tried to say something, he was silenced.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000
He was not allowed to have a platform in a women dominated area.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:26.000
And that right there, I mean, maybe it's a little bit of spitefulness, but I would love for these guys to have to know what it's like, you know, to have.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Sorry, somebody kept their Google open.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Sorry, guys.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:39.000
To have people who are used to getting their words heard and their deeds acknowledged in a position of total silence.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
That's because that's honestly enough.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000
What a lot of being a woman is like in modern society, even with our advancements.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:55.000
And so that was where I'm coming from with having something that is all matriarchal, have something that a man has no part of.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:05.000
And, you know, let them see what it's like to be disincluded and to not have their voice heard and to also have their asses handed to them by a bunch of girls.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Just saying.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.000
So anyway, this is a very complex issue that I don't think we're going to be able to solve tonight here on OLR.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000
But I just want to reiterate, I don't like I'm not rooting against the Overwatch League.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I don't like I'm not saying kill it with fire or any of this stuff.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:24.000
I'm just expressing disappointment because I was hoping if anyone was going to be able to do better, it was going to be Blizzard.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000
And, you know, this is a problem that doesn't just affect Overwatch.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
This is a problem throughout esports.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000
I was just hoping that maybe this time we would do it differently.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
And you know what? There's still time.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
But in order to get there, guys, no more excuses.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
That's all I'm saying.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Honestly.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Like Tim Gunn, my other gospel says, make it work.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
All right.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000
All right.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
By the way, that book I'm reading is amazing.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
It really is amazing.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Sounds like a fucked up episode of Black Mirror that I'd be really into.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Well.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Although that's more technology to be fair.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000
It's definitely page of text kind of book.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:17.000
But it really does point out just how much of our everyday language has been co-opted to be more positive toward men and less positive toward women.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000
And how that just even as a fabric of humanity makes its way into every facet.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
And I would say even included in games.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Yeah.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.000
You know, and I'm not saying you have to like fire all these dudes to replace him.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000
No, fire him.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Maybe the one if he doesn't shape up.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000
But I'm not saying you have to like fire all these dudes to make room for women.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
If the Overwatch League is to be successful, maybe they're going to grow into 20 teams.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
That would be great.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000
But just make sure you're, you know, doing a little more inclusiveness on the expansion teams.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
We need Team Estrogen.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Yeah.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000
That's usually when most people are asking for inclusiveness and so forth.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
It's not necessarily about taking away from what's always there.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000
What's already there.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
But like adding to it.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
I want Team Unicorn Fart.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
What city would they be from?

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Team Unicorn Fart should be a bunch of...

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000
It should be made half of gay men and their hags.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
I believe the preferred term now is flame dame.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
I'm still a hag girl.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
That's fine.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000
And so instead of hearing, you know, over the PA, you know,

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Oh, go suck a dick or whatever you'll hear.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Goldo!

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
That's what I want.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
That'd be my team.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Awesome.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000
All right.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Let's take a trip back down memory lane.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Let's go back to...

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
I'd rather not.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
This is terrible.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
All right.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Well, every week, Dark Soccer climbs into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Hey, you guys should check this game out this week.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
But, plot twist.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.000
In 2017, once a month, we brought you the classic system of the month.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:08.000
And as promised in 2018, we're going to bring you the classic peripheral of the month.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000
So once a month, Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a gaming peripheral

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
that is worthy of your attention.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I'd like people to guess what I picked.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Well, since we don't get music, you see, usually we play music from the game.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I tried to find you a commercial.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I do have a commercial.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:28.000
So let's cut to commercial for this week's classic peripheral of the month.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000
You, you, you force.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
It's so terrible.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
It's a little quiet too.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000
You, you force.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
So 84.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I know, I love that.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
This is my jam this song here.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Well, it's the you force.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Yes.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000
So it's a game controller that we made by Broderbund.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
You know, they...

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Published the guardian legend, which was their biggest contribution to gaming.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Yes.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Yes.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
And did they also publish Maniac Mansion?

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.000
I don't remember, but I also remember Broderbund was the people that put out the print shop.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
That's right.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
On Apple and Commodore.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I was their other big...

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Load Runner was the other big one.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Yeah.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:17.000
But they, they brought out the you force for the NES, which was basically had a couple

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:23.000
of IR sensor panels to translate your movements into controller signals.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
And...

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I'll just read a little bit from their print blurb.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000
It's like, introducing you force, the revolutionary controller for your Nintendo Entertainment

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000
System.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
So hot no one can touch it.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Skip, skip, skip, skip.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000
There's nothing to hold, nothing to jump on, nothing to wear.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Oh baby.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:48.000
You force creates a power field that responds to your every command, making you the controller.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Skip, skip, skip.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Now nothing comes between you and the game.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.500
Well, it was shit.

01:40:55.500 --> 01:41:04.680
You could have a little pilot yoke that would go in the middle of it, but it was really

01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:07.960
on the level of bad that the power glove was bad.

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:10.180
It didn't control anything very well.

01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:19.560
It was a neat concept, but, you know, IR technology today is a bunch better than how it was then.

01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:24.160
And we kind of have that now with, you know, more modern peripherals.

01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:29.560
But you know, I'd say it was pretty ambitious for what it was back in the day.

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:36.240
But if I am right, IGN ranked it as like one of the worst, like number 8 of the top 10

01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:38.680
worst peripherals.

01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:39.680
It was pretty bad.

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:48.800
I think that it was only like second to the Sega activator, which I have an activator

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:53.520
and it was pretty bad.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:42:04.120
This one quote that's great comes from a writer for MSN that says, don't touch said the adverts

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:09.440
for the device in a rare example of advertising campaign that got it spot on.

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:13.800
So yeah, the force, it was pretty terra bad.

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:17.960
So that's your, I'm starting off with one sucky peripheral.

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:22.160
Maybe next month I'll do one that didn't sell class or I'll just go for ultra second

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:23.280
do the activator.

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:24.280
Who knows?

01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:26.720
You know, it was still an important peripheral.

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:29.960
I think a lot of us remember it from being younger and not always for the best read.

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:33.160
I think it was one of those things where it sure looked a lot better in the ads than it

01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:34.520
actually performed.

01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:35.520
It looks neat.

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:36.520
Yeah.

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:42.640
You know, I did, I didn't have too many of the third party peripherals back from my Nintendo.

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:44.640
I'll tell you what I did have.

01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:46.720
No, actually it wasn't even third party.

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:52.400
I think I had the NES max that had the little switch over that so you could hold the buttons

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:53.400
down.

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.400
That thing was cool.

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:55.400
All right.

01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:56.400
There it is.

01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:00.880
Your classic peripheral of the month, the U force, you know, classic that word can be

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:01.880
taken many ways.

01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:02.880
All right.

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:03.880
We're going to take a break.

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:06.640
When we come back, we have plenty more orange launch radio to come, including your emails

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:07.640
question Mark.

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:08.640
I think we have some emails.

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:11.320
Uh, we'll also talk about, Ooh, PlayStation figures.

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:15.000
Is this the answer to amiibo or maybe not so much.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:26.240
We'll talk about that when we come back with more of orange launch radio, right after this.

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:31.240
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight, episode number 715 already in

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:37.120
progress for this January, the 21st of 2018, we've had a really great show so far.

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:39.800
We've kind of covered a lot of bases and what's going on in the gaming world.

01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:43.120
And we got to talk to Mel B about DDR and freestyle earlier in the show.

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.080
So I hope you all got to catch that interview, but if not, there's always the podcast because

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:50.480
not only is it a live show, it's a podcast and I know many of you listened to it that

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.480
way.

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.480
So thanks.

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:53.480
I think we just had an OLR first.

01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.480
What's that?

01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:58.920
Where, um, we had Mormons come to witness to us during the show.

01:43:58.920 --> 01:43:59.920
Yeah.

01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:00.920
Right.

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:01.920
They, they picked a good time to come by, I guess, right.

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:05.320
The halfway point of the show, but uh, yeah, we were just, OLR studios was just visited.

01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:08.880
We should have brought them in and had them on the show.

01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:10.360
What kind of video games do you guys play?

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:11.720
No, it's yeah.

01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:15.560
They were looking, they were looking for somebody now Alan and I have lived in this house for

01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:16.560
almost four years.

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:20.560
I think it's coming up on four years in April and they were looking for the person I'm assuming

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:24.040
assuming lived here before us cause we were getting mail for them for a long time.

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:25.040
So yeah.

01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:28.120
Why does this cow want to eat fish?

01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:29.520
Do cows eat fish?

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:31.200
Oh, is this animal crossing?

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:32.200
Yes.

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:33.200
Oh good Lord.

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.200
All right.

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:37.600
We need to get into some rapid fire news though, but a big hello again to those of you in chat

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:43.720
over at live.vognetwork.com and uh, are we having to compete against any TV?

01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:45.040
Do you know what that Google message was?

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:46.780
I got, do you remember my Google went off?

01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:49.240
I think it was while Jamie was saying something earlier.

01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:52.600
It was Shane messaging me, OMG Star Trek.

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.180
So I guess something must have happened on that tonight.

01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:58.400
Tell Shane OMG he needs to get that thing from my house.

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:02.360
All right, Shane, do you hear me?

01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:04.960
I don't think he listens to this show.

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:05.960
He's too busy watching Star Trek.

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:09.240
You better be listening and come get that thing from my house.

01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:11.080
All right.

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:15.400
To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.200
use the pass phrase house.

01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:19.840
Uh, let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.520
Come get the news from y'all.

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:24.960
Oh, Bobby Blackwell says the Screen Actors Guilds awards are tonight.

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:25.960
Yeah, who cares?

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:28.480
There's so many fucking award shows.

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:32.520
Like just God, every Sunday there's some damn award.

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:33.520
Anyway.

01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:40.720
At any rate, um, you, you know, I, I've finally watched the Castlevania series on Netflix.

01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:41.720
Did you watch it?

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:42.720
Rob?

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:43.720
I never did.

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:46.760
I know it's good.

01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:48.280
It's really freaking good.

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:54.760
Well, thankfully a lot of other people agreed that it was really freaking good because um,

01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:58.920
now it's been picked up for another eight episodes to come out this summer.

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:04.960
And Warren Ellis of course is going to be our writer extraordinaire.

01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:10.360
So that makes me super happy because Castlevania was really fucking good.

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:19.600
And then, um, other news too is that, um, there is apparently going to be another Master

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.600
System game released.

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:27.920
Um, well, you know, we've got the, uh, I know that some of the games have been, you know,

01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:33.400
re-released like Wonder Boy and Monsterland, but there's a game called Silver Valley that's

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:38.440
to be coming out for the Master System, which actually, as I understand it, I think the

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:41.040
Master System is still very big in Brazil.

01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:44.640
So who knows, but it looks.

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:46.400
And it's still big in our hearts.

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:47.440
That's the other important thing.

01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:49.880
It looks kind of Castlevania-ish.

01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:53.180
I'm just, yeah, it's very Castlevania-ish.

01:46:53.180 --> 01:47:00.380
You know, the same platforming and traps and, you know, uh, skeletons and whatnot all over

01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:01.380
the place.

01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:03.580
So not bad.

01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:08.820
Uh, and some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com yelling at me for not having watched Castlevania

01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:09.820
yet.

01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:11.820
Bobby Blackpool says, it's less than two hours.

01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:12.940
Even I watched Castlevania.

01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:15.180
S.J. 100 Matt says it's good.

01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:17.100
Only downside is it's far too short.

01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:19.780
Rock Cat says Castlevania was good on Netflix.

01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:21.660
I just need to take the time to watch.

01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:23.140
I don't watch movies anymore either.

01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:24.140
It seems.

01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:25.140
I don't watch Star Trek.

01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:26.140
I don't really.

01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:29.580
Well, you know, my thing right now is watching everything on YouTube, except I did start

01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:33.280
a Japanese drama that came out in 2014 called Masan.

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:38.980
And it's about a Japanese man who goes to Scotland to study how to make whiskey.

01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:45.460
And you know, like, just in, you know, they've only been dethroned a few years ago, but Japanese

01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:48.900
whiskey makers scored top in the world.

01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:55.820
And so, but he brings back his Scottish wife in, you know, 1930s Japan.

01:47:55.820 --> 01:48:00.180
And so it's about their relationship and, you know, his goal to make whiskey in Japan.

01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:06.820
But that's like big history nerd thing took off, but I want them to I want to do a drama

01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:07.820
just about gamers.

01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:10.100
They did a drama about gyaru.

01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:11.980
Why can't they do one about gamers?

01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:14.020
Lord knows there's lots of drama on the gaming community.

01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:15.020
Right.

01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:16.020
All right.

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:17.020
I have more news.

01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:20.320
I have a couple of things on Final Fantasy, including and this is one of those websites

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:23.060
where for whatever reason, it doesn't load right on my computer.

01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:28.380
But I think I remember the details of this Final Fantasy 15, the royal edition was confirmed.

01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:29.620
It's going to be coming out on March 6th.

01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:31.780
I think we talked about this as a rumor last week.

01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:34.780
Well, it turns out that it is happening and there's going to be a Windows edition that

01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:35.940
happens with it as well.

01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:39.160
So you get to get Final Fantasy 15 for the first time on PC.

01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:43.340
Not only does it come with all the existing DLC, but they're adding even more to it.

01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:45.820
I know they were talking about a new dungeon was in it as well.

01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:50.340
So some people are getting a little irritated that like they won't stop adding to Final

01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:54.540
Fantasy 15, especially for a story that's a little more narrative than something like

01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:58.140
an MMO, which leads me to Final Fantasy 14.

01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:03.860
Final Fantasy 14 is getting a patch coming out and it's patch 4.2 for Stormblood.

01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:07.020
The Rise of a New Sun that's coming out on January 30th.

01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:11.380
And perhaps what's most interesting about Rise of a New Sun is that the new raid dungeon

01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:18.580
Omega Sigmascape will feature bosses from Final Fantasy 6.

01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:22.420
In fact, in the trailer, good old Doom Train makes an appearance there.

01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:25.420
And so it looks like the first fight you'll be doing is against the Doom Train or the

01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:26.420
Phantom Train.

01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:27.700
Can you suplex it?

01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:32.080
I hope so, but no word if you get to suplex the train or not.

01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:36.620
But at the very, very, very end of the trailer, there's a shot of Kefka.

01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:39.800
So it's assumed with that laugh even.

01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:43.200
So it's assumed that you will actually fight Kefka at the end of this.

01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:44.200
So it's pretty cool.

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:48.440
I did the last raid because Omega Deltascape was kind of out.

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:49.560
I think it was out with the expansion.

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:50.560
It was 4.1.

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:51.680
I don't remember.

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:55.680
But in that one, you fought a bunch of Final Fantasy 5 bosses.

01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:56.780
And so that was pretty cool.

01:49:56.780 --> 01:50:02.140
But you know, since 5 wasn't released here in the US originally, I don't remember it

01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:04.440
as well as I remember 4 and 6.

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:08.120
So I'm thinking we're getting the 6 bosses here and maybe we're going to get Final Fantasy

01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:10.320
4 bosses in the last raid or something.

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:11.400
We'll see.

01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:21.040
By the way, just from chat, ActDeft did bring up that we should watch The Shape of Water,

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:22.040
which I did see.

01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:23.040
I was going to say, you did see that, didn't you?

01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:24.120
I did see that.

01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:29.720
And honestly enough, it's playing now over at Arden Fermol.

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:31.500
I want to take you to see that.

01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:32.500
Is that good, huh?

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:33.500
It's that good.

01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:39.820
I think that there's one of the characters in it that I think that you would just find

01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:43.200
completely heartbreaking and adore him.

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:44.200
There's so many movies.

01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:49.000
I still need to see Lady Bird, which everyone in this town is talking about.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.980
And I never saw Get Out.

01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:52.980
I have it.

01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:55.900
I'm thinking of the movies that are going to get nominated for Oscars this year.

01:50:55.900 --> 01:50:57.740
And I never did see Get Out.

01:50:57.740 --> 01:50:59.020
I just didn't get around to it.

01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:01.940
I picked it up on Blu-ray if you want to come watch it at my house.

01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:02.940
Oh, okay.

01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:07.920
I went to see it at the reclining theaters.

01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:11.540
It was seriously next to Star Wars, the best movie I had seen.

01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:13.940
I still haven't seen Star Wars.

01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:16.480
The last movie I saw in theaters was the Power Ranger movie.

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.300
Was that even this year or 2017?

01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:23.620
I saw The Shape of Water this year because I went to see it right after my surgery.

01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:27.320
And I have to say, actually, yeah, it was this year.

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:30.020
But I cried halfway through the movie.

01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:31.900
I cried at the end of the movie.

01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:33.540
It was kind of ugly.

01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:41.460
My mascara is a little too expensive to go see movies like that.

01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:46.680
But I think that you and I should see it before I go back to work.

01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:47.880
I'm that serious about it.

01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:49.500
I will pay for you to see it.

01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:50.500
Well shucks.

01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:52.660
Who am I to say no to free?

01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:53.660
So we'll work it out.

01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:54.660
All right.

01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:56.980
Well, for now, we got to travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:00.380
And Loki's not here, but I will do my best to make up for...

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:02.820
Oh, I thought I was going to do it because I'd already pulled it up.

01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:03.820
Oh, well then go ahead.

01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:06.820
Unless you want me to do the Japanese ones.

01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:07.820
Let's try that.

01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:08.820
Why don't you do the Japanese ones?

01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:11.780
Okay, then go ahead and do the American ones and I'll get it to load.

01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:13.300
The Japanese list can be a little funky.

01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:15.260
You have to jump from system to system.

01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:16.820
It's not all in one place.

01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:17.820
All right.

01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:22.140
So I will start with the US ones and it's reverse night here at OLR.

01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:28.020
Coming out on the 23rd is Iconoclasts for Windows, Mac, PS4, and PS Vita.

01:52:28.020 --> 01:52:30.220
Who knew the PS Vita was still getting releases here?

01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:33.780
The Inpatient is a PS VR game that you'll see on the 23rd.

01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:36.460
Lost Sphere, I think I know some people looking forward to that.

01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:40.540
That's on Windows and the Nintendo Switch as well as PlayStation 4 and Subnautica for

01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:41.540
Windows and Mac.

01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:48.140
A little later, kind of off the regular release, 23rd, we have on the 25th, Celeste on Windows,

01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:49.860
Switch, and PlayStation 4.

01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:55.480
We have Dragon Ball FighterZ, or Fighters, coming out for Windows, PS4, and Xbox One.

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:56.740
That is on the 26th.

01:52:56.740 --> 01:53:01.900
Lastly, Monster Hunter World on the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One.

01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:03.980
So Jamie's going to give the Japanese releases a go.

01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:04.980
I'm excited to hear this.

01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:09.460
I have found an alternate list, but it's not listing the exact dates on it.

01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:10.820
So let's go back over here.

01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:11.820
Okay.

01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:12.820
All right.

01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:14.100
So you just pick a system and read what's on it.

01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:15.100
Well, sort of.

01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:17.220
You have to be careful because it mixes in stuff from other countries.

01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:20.420
So the first one is that Nanatsu, if you see that.

01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:26.940
Yeah, Nanatsu no Taizai, Britannia no Tabibito.

01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:30.180
And that is coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:39.380
We have Fighting Edge Blade for PS4 and PC, Ninkiseyuu no Tsukurikata on, yeah, PS4.

01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:41.700
And there's a limited edition coming out.

01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:47.660
And we have Axiom Verge, multiverse edition, that's, yeah, Monster Hunter World, Dragon

01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:51.380
Ball Fighter Z on the 26th.

01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:56.300
We also have, let me scooch on down a bit.

01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:57.620
I think that's it for that system.

01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:58.620
That's it.

01:53:58.620 --> 01:53:59.620
Yeah.

01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:00.620
How am I doing, Rob?

01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:01.620
So far so good.

01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:03.140
You just have to be able to, reading this list is a little messy.

01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:07.620
We also have the PlayStation 4 Monster Hunter World Starter Pack in glacier white and jet

01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:08.620
black.

01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:09.620
Nice.

01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:11.420
So voila.

01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:23.700
So on Vita, because people still love the Vita there, we have Ninkiseyuu no Tsukurikata,

01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:24.700
the same one.

01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:27.860
We have a Nekomimi multigaming headset.

01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:31.620
You know what the Nekomimi is, right?

01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:35.980
It's the cat ears that move based on how your emotions are.

01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:36.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:43.140
It doesn't have a date on it, but it says unepic, so whatever that is.

01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:45.900
And let's go, there's stuff for PS3?

01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:46.900
Nope.

01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:50.620
I just find it hilarious that that list is on here.

01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:59.060
Xbox One, Dragon Ball Fighter Z, and that's it because they don't like the Xbox in Japan.

01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:03.220
The Monster Hunter World.

01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:05.620
Let's see what we've got for Switch.

01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:08.860
Voez on the 25th.

01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:17.420
We have the multigaming headset coming out later on this month, so not too much.

01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:22.420
And then, let me see what we have on 3DS.

01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:30.580
On 3DS we, ooh, the new Nintendo 2DS XL Pikachu edition in Australia.

01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:34.620
And Radiant Historia, perfect chronology, oh also European.

01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:37.460
So yeah, not too much, really.

01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:40.700
So kind of slow.

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:42.820
Alright.

01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:44.580
And let me do Europe too, because I will.

01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:45.580
Might as well.

01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:46.580
I wasn't ready for that.

01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:47.580
Alright.

01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:49.660
Well, it's kind of fun to switch it up, right?

01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:50.660
Yeah.

01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:56.420
On the, what's today, the 21st, okay, on the 23rd we have icon class.

01:55:56.420 --> 01:55:59.360
The, wait, that's US, what am I doing?

01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:02.660
Because I had it up to, stupid.

01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:04.300
I'm all confused, Rob.

01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:05.660
Okay, on the 26th.

01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:07.860
Juggling three regions is hard.

01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:08.860
Yeah.

01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:13.860
On the 26th we have Dragon Ball FighterZ on PC, PS4, and X-Bone.

01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:16.140
That's it.

01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:21.820
Alright, well as if that wasn't enough, it's time to jump into the mailbag.

01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:22.820
Which is empty.

01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:23.820
Is it empty tonight?

01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:24.820
It was spam.

01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:25.820
Oh, I thought we actually had one tonight.

01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:26.820
Alright.

01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:28.380
There was only spam in there, I looked at them both.

01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:30.720
Well you need to get the spammers out of here, people.

01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:31.720
Help us out.

01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:36.800
You can send us emails, participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com if you want to participate, along with

01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:37.800
the show.

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.800
Get on it.

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:39.800
Alright.

01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:43.560
In the meantime, let's get back to some other news, and then we'll be taking your phone

01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:48.080
calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype in just a little while.

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.080
But first.

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:51.640
Of course.

01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:57.060
PlayStation is doing their own answer, well Sony is doing their own answer to Amiibo,

01:56:57.060 --> 01:57:01.560
but they're not like Amiibo, they're just collectible figures.

01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:07.600
It's called, hold on let me get it, it's called Totaku, and some of the figures, there's

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:13.400
only one of these that I actually want, I want the Parappa, because I even had Parappa

01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:20.440
Happy Meal toys from Japan, so, except someone stole it out of my damn car, asshole.

01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:27.080
But anyway, they are doing Bloodborne's Hunter, Crash Bandicoot, Parappa the Rapper, Kratos

01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:32.320
from God of War, the Thasar FX-350 Racing Ship from Wipeout, okay that one might be

01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:37.760
worth it, Sackboy from LittleBigPlanet, and Heihachi from Tekken, they'll all be $9.99,

01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:41.460
I mean I might want a Heihachi just to, I'd put him on my cubicle wall, and just have

01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:45.440
him stare at my neighbor Kelby, he'd probably find that hilarious though.

01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:48.540
Yeah, you know some people are looking at these and going, oh is this Sony's answer

01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:52.680
to Amiibo, but no, they're not, they're not gonna have little chips in them, they don't

01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:53.680
interact with the games.

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:54.680
The Heihachi figure looks pretty cool.

01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:56.760
They're just figures, that's all they are.

01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:59.840
I want a Yoshimitsu though, they should do a Yoshimitsu.

01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:01.640
If these do well, they'll probably do a series too.

01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:02.800
I'm gonna get Parappa, Parappa's the one I want.

01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:06.780
You know why, there's figures coming out, it's not just Amiibo, it's those pop vinyls,

01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:10.400
my favorite, I always talk about here on this show, those pop vinyls are everywhere.

01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:13.560
How disturbing is the shirtless, reclining Jeff Goldblum?

01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:15.320
Oh yeah, that was funny, I like that.

01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:18.520
That is frightening, I never, I've never found him attractive.

01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:21.920
Uh, see, and I'm one of those things where I'm like, God, those pop vinyl things are

01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:27.800
everywhere, but yet, I still really want the Trixie Mattel and the Alaska and the RuPaul,

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.760
the Drag Race series they just put out.

01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:35.680
Did you know that there are other of those cardboard toys that are already out on the

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:36.680
market?

01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:37.680
Labo, or?

01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:47.260
Kinda like Labo, but they're more for stem, like there's one called Makey Makey, Little

01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:54.060
Bits Droid Inventor Kit, Bloxels, Anki Overdrive, just listing some of them, and this one does

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:58.040
use kind of wood and circuit boards called Piper and Kano.

01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:00.460
But do any of them interface with games?

01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:01.460
That's gonna be what separates?

01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:04.220
There's robot making ones, so, I mean, pretty cool stuff.

01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:07.220
I still think Labo's gonna kinda be in a category of its own, you know?

01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:08.220
Well, cause it's Nintendo.

01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:09.220
Of course!

01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:10.220
Nintendo Special.

01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:11.220
Of course!

01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:12.220
Absolutely.

01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:16.260
Alright, so you might get some of those Totaku figures.

01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:19.180
I might.

01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:20.180
I might too, we'll see.

01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:23.700
I want Parappa, really, cause I just, I like Parappa.

01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:27.340
So we know that one of the big, big games out there in the world, we don't talk about

01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:31.140
it a lot here on OLR, cause I just don't think any of us really play it, but I know a lot

01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:33.500
of people do, and that's the FIFA series.

01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:36.380
Specifically, this story is about FIFA 18.

01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:40.980
You would expect that this game is sold a lot and a lot on Playstation 4 and Xbox One,

01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:45.380
and of course it has, at least here in the States, but in Japan, interesting, because

01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:50.220
some numbers have just come out about the sales of FIFA 18, and it turns out the Playstation

01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:56.980
4 version of FIFA sold 77,000 copies, about, I'm rounding here, the Switch version sold

01:59:56.980 --> 02:00:00.300
89,000 copies.

02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:06.020
So in Japan, the Nintendo Switch version of FIFA 18 did better than the Playstation 4

02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:10.540
version, you know, so is this gonna make EA pay a little more attention to the Switch?

02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:11.540
Eh, we'll see.

02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:16.380
I bet those sales numbers still, I think they'll probably get a lot bigger here in the States

02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:20.380
and especially, maybe not so much the States, but especially Europe, I'm sure those numbers

02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:26.140
look a lot different, but still, you can't help but notice, it's selling on the Switch

02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:29.100
more than it is on the Playstation 4, at least in Japan.

02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:33.060
So it's, I guess, a testament to how popular the Nintendo Switch is right now.

02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:34.060
True that.

02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:38.420
Dungeon Buster points out a really good fact about this, the Switch is also mobile, and

02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:43.380
Japan has a huge mobile market, oh heck yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's lots of people even

02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:46.740
here that are like, hmm, I might pick that up on the Switch, because that would be good

02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:49.100
to have that on the go as well as on the TV.

02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:53.580
Heck, I'm still waiting for that Mega Man collection, no, I'm sorry, the Disney, I mean,

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:57.140
the Mega Man one will be cool too, and I know that's coming, but the Disney cartoon collection,

02:00:57.140 --> 02:01:01.260
I'm still waiting for that on Switch, I haven't bought it yet, so I want it where I can take

02:01:01.260 --> 02:01:03.400
it on the go, and have it on the TV.

02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:06.580
I want it all.

02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:07.580
Dark Soccer, what do you have?

02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:12.360
I want the world, I want the whole world.

02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:18.020
Super Mario Odyssey has got new outfits coming out, because part of the fun is dressing up

02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:19.020
Mario.

02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:20.020
Hooray.

02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:26.540
There are going to, not only are there going to be more outfits, there's going to be more

02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:32.500
snapshot mode filters that come through, so this should be some pretty cute fun stuff,

02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:38.940
if you like dressing up Mario like a cutie patootie, or in a wedding dress.

02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:40.780
That's really it, there's nothing more exciting about that.

02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:44.660
I'm glad they're still continuing to kind of develop stuff for Super Mario Odyssey,

02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:49.620
I'm kind of surprised we don't have new worlds yet, but we'll see, that's probably coming

02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:53.060
at some point, right?

02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:54.380
Well at some point.

02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:58.440
Also for the Switch, Skyrim, you know, that game's been around forever, and it finally

02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:03.140
made its debut on the Switch late last year, and it turns out, most people figured it was

02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:07.860
probably just a quick little port of Skyrim over to the Switch, but it turns out some

02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:13.540
of those infamous bugs in Skyrim were actually fixed on the Nintendo Switch, and not through

02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:17.200
mods or anything like that, because the Switch version doesn't support mods.

02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:23.540
But one example that's being cited is that when you approach Brinjolf in the town of

02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:28.600
Riften about a business opportunity, this is how you join the Thieves Guild.

02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:33.380
You steal a ring, and you plant it on a merchant, Brinjolf, who gets arrested.

02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:38.880
Now Brinjolf says that Brinjolf will only be in jail for a few days, but in the other

02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:43.220
versions of the game, this character ends up being imprisoned for the rest of the game.

02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:47.040
So what you have to do, you have to drop the ring, and then you can join the guild.

02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:51.740
But apparently in the Nintendo Switch version, you don't have to do that, Brinjolf does get

02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:54.200
released a few days into the game.

02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:58.100
So that got fixed, and some people are just now finding out about that, because obviously

02:02:58.100 --> 02:03:01.680
Skyrim has a million things you can do in it, and some people are just getting around

02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:02.680
to that.

02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:05.280
So it's kind of interesting that some of the bugs in the Switch version of the game were

02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:06.680
actually fixed.

02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:09.880
So is the Switch version of the game the definitive version?

02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:11.280
Well, it's hard to say.

02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:14.920
I guess it would depend on what's important to you, because if mods are important to you,

02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:18.400
well, you might want to stick with the PC version, or at least maybe one of the other

02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:19.400
ones.

02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:23.820
The most HD graphics, and the most HD-est, if that's a term.

02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:24.820
It's HD-er.

02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:30.860
Then maybe the Playstation 4, Xbox One versions, or PC are going to really be up your alley.

02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:35.300
I don't know, I still think that Skyrim just begs for modding, you know?

02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:36.300
Oh yeah.

02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:39.660
I love Skyrim, but I am, and I'm glad it got a Switch release.

02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:43.340
I know there's people that are excited to have that mobile, but I really am ready for

02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:45.300
what's next with Elder Scrolls, guys.

02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:47.820
I want the new job Skyrim job.

02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:48.820
The new version.

02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:51.680
Let's get to the next thing in the Elder Scrolls universe.

02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:52.680
It's time.

02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:53.680
This is sad.

02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:54.680
It's time.

02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:55.680
Sad-facedness.

02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:57.640
Sorry to give you sad news here towards the end.

02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:04.640
Well, and he's actually, I mean, an artist that I've looked up to, Bob Wakelin, died.

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:13.640
And he did the covers for a lot of NES games, including Contra, which is iconic.

02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:16.000
Rainbow Islands, New Zealand Story.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.020
New Zealand Story is such a fun little game, too.

02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:22.180
Mr. Nuts on SNES, a whole bunch of others.

02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:31.620
He also did a lot of artwork for the Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST, and Amiga.

02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:36.660
And it got him a lot of fame in Europe, and he did a lot of European covers for Midnight

02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:42.140
Resistance, Batman, Whizball, Head Over Heels, and Hunchback.

02:04:43.100 --> 02:04:50.460
His work, I mean, really covered a lot of our childhoods, like, I mean, he did Rastan.

02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:59.340
He did, um, and his artwork was so versatile, because he could do realistic, and then he

02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:07.900
could do cartoony or parody style artwork, and it was just absolutely amazing.

02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:15.580
He could do games that clearly needed to be cutesy and a bit more, I'd say, Japanese

02:05:15.580 --> 02:05:16.580
in appearance.

02:05:16.580 --> 02:05:25.940
He could do them well, and I am just completely saddened and floored, because he seriously

02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:29.100
was one of the people that inspired me to get into art.

02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:32.380
So may your memory be a blessing.

02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:39.020
Well, not all the news is good, but definitely take a moment to reflect on what he's given,

02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:43.740
you know, the gaming community through these iconic artworks, advertising games.

02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:47.420
Even his fantasy art and realistic style, it put him up there with, like, Julie Bell

02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:49.680
and Boris Vallejo.

02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:50.680
Really amazing work.

02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:55.660
Well, lastly here, before we get to the phones, and wow, I didn't realize the second half

02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:59.660
of the show was gonna fly by compared to the first half, but I also thought we had at least

02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:00.660
one email.

02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:03.980
Hopefully we'll get some calls here at Orange Lounge Radio in just a moment, but I have

02:06:03.980 --> 02:06:07.100
one more thing for you before we get to the phones, and that has to do with something

02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:08.100
that's been announced.

02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:12.340
It is a Kickstarter project, so, you know, I always kind of take these with a grain of

02:06:12.340 --> 02:06:14.740
salt, but it does sound pretty cool.

02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:16.660
It's something called NES Maker.

02:06:16.660 --> 02:06:20.640
Now, this sounds really similar to something we had a couple weeks ago, where it was like

02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:24.740
you were taking all these NES game things, it was kind of like a hodgepodge Mario Maker,

02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:27.700
but I think that was on, I think that was a little different.

02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:34.220
NES Maker is actually a program that they're developing, that's available on Kickstarter,

02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:38.580
where you can actually do sprite graphics and color palettes that are constrained by

02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:39.900
NES limitations.

02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:45.500
You create assets to go with the NES, and it's all object-oriented, like Game Maker

02:06:45.500 --> 02:06:46.500
or Unity.

02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:48.980
You can use a text editor to do strings for NPCs.

02:06:48.980 --> 02:06:53.980
You create special screens, like start screens, customize the AI, et cetera, et cetera.

02:06:53.980 --> 02:06:57.380
Basically this is gonna allow you to create your own NES game without having to learn

02:06:57.380 --> 02:07:00.180
the actual complicated programming that goes with it.

02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:04.220
Might be a very good entry way for some people that are kind of like, oh, I want to create

02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:05.220
a game.

02:07:05.220 --> 02:07:08.420
This might be something that would help people do that, so, pretty cool.

02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:13.260
I like though a lot of the Maker programs, I tried to learn my way through RPG Maker

02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:14.260
for a while.

02:07:14.260 --> 02:07:18.180
I still want to do something in RPG, I want to do like the OLR adventure.

02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:21.460
Now Kaijuto in chat says Nintendo gonna shut that shit down.

02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:23.980
You know, I'm not sure they can.

02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:30.860
I mean, NES Maker is about, but does Nintendo have NES itself trademarked, or do they have

02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:33.060
Nintendo Entertainment System trademarked?

02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:37.860
Because I just don't think, I mean, because they're not using Mario to sell it, they're

02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:42.620
not using Zelda, so they're not infringing on those sorts of iconic characters to do

02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:43.620
this.

02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:47.740
They're just saying, hey, you can make games that look like they're from the Nintendo era.

02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:53.260
So I'm not sure Nintendo would have much of a case here, or if they'd want one, to be

02:07:53.260 --> 02:07:54.260
honest.

02:07:54.260 --> 02:08:01.900
Now the thing that has me curious is if something like this would put out like a NES ROM, so

02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:04.620
that I could play it on like an EverDrive or something.

02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:10.540
Oh, now, okay, so Bobby Blackwolf says you can actually compile them to a NES ROM like

02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:11.540
you're okay.

02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:13.460
So he's saying that this is something I'm missing.

02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:18.140
Ah, well, that may be a little trickier with that, but.

02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:22.940
And then I wonder if it can be compiled into a NES ROM, then can you use it as a ROM editor?

02:08:23.820 --> 02:08:26.140
Well, here's the thing.

02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:31.820
Now again, I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know how far down this hole I want to go, but technically

02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:35.400
emulators are to play homegrown ROMs.

02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:38.820
You're not supposed to play the actual Super Mario Brothers and stuff.

02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:45.020
So is there really a legal problem if you make this NES ROM that isn't Mario or Zelda,

02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:47.220
something of your own creation, and you play it in an emulator?

02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:48.220
Well, is that wrong?

02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:53.680
I don't think Nintendo's done anything to shut down the Kaizo Mario games either.

02:08:53.680 --> 02:09:00.240
And we've had a couple of the Kaizo-type games run at Games Done Quick.

02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:02.980
And Bobby Blackwolf says Nintendo doesn't shut down homebrew.

02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:06.380
All this program does is let you create homebrew without learning assembly language.

02:09:06.380 --> 02:09:11.560
And yeah, in my mind, kind of goes to, well, remember when they fought Tengen and Color

02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:15.460
Dreams and those other companies that weren't really officially Nintendo licensed that reverse

02:09:15.460 --> 02:09:16.460
engine the cartridge?

02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:17.580
They lost that case.

02:09:17.580 --> 02:09:24.020
At the time too, Nintendo was making money on the system.

02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:30.560
I mean, to be honest, they're not really making anything on the Nintendo now.

02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:38.140
So they had a lot more to lose by not having, I would say almost a monopoly on that cartridge

02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:40.560
format or making the games.

02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:42.980
They were wanting to filter everything through their control.

02:09:42.980 --> 02:09:52.680
And now that the NES is no longer a profitable system, other than, of course, the NES Classic

02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:57.380
and stuff like that, that there's not really too much that I think they should be super

02:09:57.380 --> 02:09:58.380
worried about it.

02:09:58.380 --> 02:10:03.500
It would just be the use of IPs that are still something that's bringing in money.

02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:07.100
I think as long as the games that come out of this are not trying to infringe on the

02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:12.820
stuff that I'm assuming, at some point Nintendo will want to sell on a Switch Virtual Console,

02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:16.820
you know, be it Balloon Fight multiplayer across the internet or whatever it is.

02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:20.020
I just don't think I don't see any problems as long as some of those intellectual things

02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:21.020
don't get infringed on.

02:10:21.020 --> 02:10:22.700
You'd think of something better than Balloon Fight.

02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:26.900
Well, but I just wasn't that in one of the early commercials or something or something?

02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:30.100
There's a screenshot or something like, we know that one's coming.

02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:33.580
And plus it could also be the whole Iwata tie-in.

02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:36.220
That could be why they chose that particular game.

02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:37.220
You know?

02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:38.220
So who knows?

02:10:38.220 --> 02:10:39.220
Possibly.

02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:40.220
Yeah.

02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:43.180
I want them to do a collection of games and names.

02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:48.460
I want them to do the Yokoi collection.

02:10:48.460 --> 02:10:57.180
Just like a super cartridge of all of the games that were designed or influenced by

02:10:57.180 --> 02:10:59.060
Gunpei Yokoi.

02:10:59.060 --> 02:11:02.780
Why do that when you can sell them for five bucks a piece on the Switch?

02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:03.780
Yeah.

02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:04.780
I don't know.

02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:05.780
That's the reality.

02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:06.780
Wishful thinking.

02:11:06.780 --> 02:11:07.780
All right.

02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:08.780
The Skype line is open.

02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:11.180
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:15.020
If you want to give us a call and we can talk about anything we've discussed so far tonight

02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:16.640
or something else.

02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:18.140
Maybe you have something else.

02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:20.400
Maybe you want to preview your freestyle routine.

02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:21.400
It's coming up this Saturday.

02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:23.180
I don't know how to do that with audio only.

02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:25.540
You can tell us what song.

02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:29.460
Confirm if you're doing Ariana Grande or something else from DDR Ace.

02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:33.620
Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:36.900
I'd usually go around and ask if we have any last minute stories, although I'm not sure.

02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:37.900
I'm not sure you do.

02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:38.900
Right, Jamie?

02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:39.900
I think we covered most of the stuff, right?

02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:40.900
No.

02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:41.900
I have a story.

02:11:41.900 --> 02:11:42.900
What?

02:11:42.900 --> 02:11:43.900
This alligator guy in my game is a bitch.

02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:45.900
I don't think that has anything to do with games, but we do have the phone.

02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:46.900
It's a game?

02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:47.900
Oh.

02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:48.900
Oh.

02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:49.900
Oh.

02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:50.900
The alligator in Animal Crossing.

02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:51.900
Yeah.

02:11:51.900 --> 02:11:52.900
Well, hey, we do have the phone lighting up.

02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:53.900
Hi.

02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:54.900
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:55.900
Who's this?

02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:56.900
What's going on, everyone?

02:11:56.900 --> 02:11:57.900
It's Rama.

02:11:57.900 --> 02:11:58.900
Hey, Rama.

02:11:58.900 --> 02:11:59.900
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:00.900
Good to hear from you.

02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:06.140
Besides the fact that my tea is overflowing from the stuff that I missed on Facebook because

02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:07.580
I went to the movies.

02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:08.740
Spill it.

02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:11.820
I'm just like, damn.

02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:12.820
Facebook drama?

02:12:12.820 --> 02:12:16.060
It's within the cosplay community and other things.

02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:17.060
Spill the tea.

02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:19.060
It's just like, Jesus.

02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:21.740
My teacup, it runneth over.

02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:25.300
Just honestly, just log out.

02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:27.340
That's kind of the point where I'm at with Facebook.

02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:33.300
Facebook is sharing important life updates and pictures of Mr. Smoosh, and that's about

02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:34.300
it.

02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:35.300
I don't need Facebook for anything else right now.

02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:39.580
But some of the stuff that's going on, I do keep an ear to because it does affect the

02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:41.660
cosplay community as a whole.

02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:47.060
So I need to know what's going on with that so I can have my investigative reporters kind

02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:48.540
of follow the paper trail.

02:12:48.540 --> 02:12:54.100
Yeah, I guess you do have to be connected for your show.

02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:59.060
Like well, if you haven't seen our article about Anime Matsuri, yeah.

02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:01.060
That bullshit.

02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:09.140
Uchon, I've gotten a lot of anonymous posts in my inbox in regards to what was going on.

02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:14.260
I sent it to Koi and she dropped her tea when I sent you those screenshots.

02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:15.260
So yeah.

02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:18.260
I saw.

02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:22.260
That is some fetid stuff.

02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:26.860
Yeah, it's basically why I decided not to go back this year.

02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:29.860
Yeah, I'm glad I never went.

02:13:30.660 --> 02:13:33.660
Well, I only went last year just for Sarah Mead.

02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:34.660
That's it.

02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:39.660
I understood what was going on, but I felt I knew that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:41.660
So I'm going to take a stab at it.

02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:43.660
They're supposed to have like another big announcement.

02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:45.660
I have a theory of what it is.

02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:48.660
And if my theory is correct, it's still not enough for me to go.

02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:54.660
Well, I think that we should not keep people who are in suspense and in the dark.

02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:57.660
So why don't you spill a little bit of that?

02:13:58.460 --> 02:14:03.660
Well, my theory is they put it, they made this post and they said Sailor Moon and Hangout

02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:04.660
Story 2018.

02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:10.660
My theory is either going to get the entire English dub cast or the current Japanese cast

02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:12.660
for Sailor Moon Crystal.

02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:14.660
That's my theory.

02:14:14.660 --> 02:14:18.660
Well, if you got enough money, you can get almost whatever you want at your convention.

02:14:18.660 --> 02:14:21.660
I'd be surprised AX isn't pulling something like that instead because they've got the

02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:24.660
bigger crowd share.

02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:26.660
Yeah.

02:14:26.660 --> 02:14:27.660
Yeah.

02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:28.660
I believe that.

02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:31.660
Well, now Rama, did you just want to talk about conventions or is there something else

02:14:31.660 --> 02:14:32.660
on your mind tonight?

02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:33.660
No, no, no, Rob.

02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:37.660
I just want to thank you again for making me feel like a nerdy 12 year old.

02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:39.660
And I mean that in a positive way.

02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:40.660
Why is that?

02:14:40.660 --> 02:14:43.660
What did I say that got you feeling like a nerdy 12 year old?

02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:46.660
Talk about Nintendo Labo and the science for your kids.

02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:47.660
Oh, yeah.

02:14:47.660 --> 02:14:48.660
Yeah.

02:14:48.660 --> 02:14:49.660
Yeah.

02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:52.660
Oh, those kids I was talking about from like Radio Shack with the springs and the wires

02:14:52.660 --> 02:14:53.660
and all that.

02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:54.660
Yes.

02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:58.660
I was bouncing off the walls when you mentioned that because I could have sworn I called in

02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:03.660
and spoke about this before, but every summer when I would finish school, I would go to

02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:08.660
Radio Shack and buy one of the kits and I will play with this kit for the entire summer.

02:15:08.660 --> 02:15:11.660
And yes, I did the whole little FM radio thing too.

02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:13.660
I thought that was one of the coolest things ever.

02:15:13.660 --> 02:15:14.660
Isn't it?

02:15:14.660 --> 02:15:15.660
Yeah.

02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:16.660
Those things are rad.

02:15:16.660 --> 02:15:19.660
Like I learned a lot about science and things from kits like that.

02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:23.660
So, you know, Labo is in some ways a different form of that.

02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:28.660
Well, I'm sure those kits still have to exist in some form or another, but I'm sure a lot

02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:30.660
now is like iPads and shit.

02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:31.660
No, no, no.

02:15:31.660 --> 02:15:36.660
I kind of think that the science for kids kind of evolved into those little robotic

02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:39.660
Raspberry Pi kits you see at Micro Center.

02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:40.660
Oh, shit.

02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:41.660
Yeah, probably.

02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:46.660
That's what it's become, you know, and I missed the presentation about this, but I caught

02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:49.660
up to it and I'm like cardboard.

02:15:49.660 --> 02:15:50.660
That's kind of cool.

02:15:50.660 --> 02:15:56.660
And what bothered me is that there were people complaining about this, saying this is a kid's

02:15:56.660 --> 02:15:57.660
thing, this is that.

02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:00.660
And I'm like, Nintendo did say this is for kids.

02:16:00.660 --> 02:16:08.660
If you are an adult complaining about something for children that the company said is for

02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:11.660
children, you need to reprioritize your life.

02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:12.660
Yeah.

02:16:12.660 --> 02:16:15.660
Nintendo has more than one team that does stuff.

02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:23.660
And, you know, look, the Wii U had a real problem getting in everybody's home.

02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:28.660
If this Labo thing is going to help the Switch get in more homes, including homes with kids,

02:16:28.660 --> 02:16:33.660
that's going to benefit everybody in the long run, because then Nintendo will have more money

02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:41.660
to develop other stuff like Smash or Metroid Prime 4 or the rumored other new 2D Metroid,

02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:45.660
which we skipped over tonight, but was in the news and all this other stuff.

02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:47.660
So, you know, it's fine.

02:16:47.660 --> 02:16:51.660
There's it's like we said earlier about inclusiveness.

02:16:51.660 --> 02:16:55.660
You can include stuff with adding to it.

02:16:55.660 --> 02:16:57.660
Yeah, exactly.

02:16:57.660 --> 02:17:03.660
But my thing is, if this is successful enough and we see like these little science fair robotic

02:17:03.660 --> 02:17:07.660
kits, somebody is going to come up with something to tether it to the Switch.

02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:13.660
I mean, buying like one of these little robot kits, you load the Switch software, use the

02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:15.660
JoyCon to control it and stuff like that.

02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:17.660
Is it Rock'em Sock'em Robots?

02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:18.660
There's your money maker right there.

02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:19.660
By the way, I copyrighted that idea.

02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:22.660
I get 15% off the top and 5% goes to OLR.

02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:27.660
Except the problem is you don't own the patent on Rock'em Sock'em Robots.

02:17:27.660 --> 02:17:30.660
But I own the idea of putting it on the Switch.

02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:31.660
Ah.

02:17:31.660 --> 02:17:32.660
Good luck.

02:17:32.660 --> 02:17:33.660
I hope you have a good lawyer.

02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:35.660
Yes, I do.

02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:37.660
It's called Do We Cheat'em and How.

02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:41.660
I got a good reference from Bobby Blackwolf.

02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:42.660
I love it.

02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:46.660
So are you personally going to pick up Labo or is this better for the kids?

02:17:46.660 --> 02:17:47.660
This is better for the kids.

02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:48.660
But you know what?

02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:52.660
I kind of see myself getting a Switch before the year is out.

02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:56.660
I'm just like, they couldn't get me with the Wii.

02:17:56.660 --> 02:18:00.660
They couldn't get me with the Wii U and now they're bringing the games I wanted for Wii

02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:01.660
U to the Switch.

02:18:01.660 --> 02:18:04.660
I'm like, just take the credit card.

02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:05.660
I don't want it.

02:18:05.660 --> 02:18:06.660
Just take it.

02:18:06.660 --> 02:18:09.660
Give me my stuff and just give me the bill.

02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:13.660
I predict you will also have a moment of weakness before the year is over.

02:18:13.660 --> 02:18:15.660
Probably.

02:18:15.660 --> 02:18:16.660
Probably.

02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:17.660
All right, Rama.

02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:19.660
I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in some more calls.

02:18:19.660 --> 02:18:20.660
But it's always good to hear from you.

02:18:20.660 --> 02:18:24.660
And people should also be listening to Anime Jam Session to hear more of you.

02:18:24.660 --> 02:18:25.660
Oh, definitely.

02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:28.660
And it's also good to hear from all of y'all, especially Oogchon and Loki.

02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:32.660
Well, Loki's not here tonight, so you haven't heard much from him.

02:18:32.660 --> 02:18:34.660
Well, you know.

02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:37.660
It's always a pleasure to hear from me.

02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:39.660
It's all good.

02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:40.660
I'll let Loki know he's alive.

02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:41.660
Sorry, not sorry.

02:18:41.660 --> 02:18:42.660
All right.

02:18:42.660 --> 02:18:43.660
Stay fabulous, Rob.

02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:44.660
All right.

02:18:44.660 --> 02:18:45.660
You too.

02:18:45.660 --> 02:18:46.660
All right.

02:18:46.660 --> 02:18:47.660
Bye.

02:18:47.660 --> 02:18:48.660
Bye.

02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:49.660
Orange Lounge.

02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:50.660
I'm sorry, I have coughs.

02:18:50.660 --> 02:18:52.660
Orange Lounge, Hakkio.

02:18:52.660 --> 02:18:53.660
I need water.

02:18:53.660 --> 02:18:56.660
It's your turn to fill time, Darsara.

02:18:56.660 --> 02:19:01.660
Well, I could give you the saga of what's happening in my Animal Crossing village.

02:19:01.660 --> 02:19:04.660
Everyone sucks, and they're sending me on nothing but fetch quests.

02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:05.660
The end.

02:19:05.660 --> 02:19:06.660
No, seriously, though.

02:19:06.660 --> 02:19:12.660
I mean, I did plan, by the way, on starting to stream.

02:19:12.660 --> 02:19:14.660
I was going to do Halo.

02:19:14.660 --> 02:19:20.660
I cannot find one that runs on PC, you know?

02:19:20.660 --> 02:19:25.660
We set up a time to do it over here on my Xbox One version of the Anniversary Collection,

02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:26.660
which is close enough.

02:19:26.660 --> 02:19:27.660
Close enough.

02:19:27.660 --> 02:19:28.660
Oh, my God.

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:30.660
Did you know that Koi sell for 4,000 bells?

02:19:30.660 --> 02:19:31.660
No.

02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:32.660
We have calls coming in.

02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:33.660
Oh, good.

02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:34.660
All right.

02:19:34.660 --> 02:19:35.660
Hi, you're on...

02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:39.660
Oh, I thought I grabbed that call, and it dropped right off.

02:19:39.660 --> 02:19:41.660
So we'll see if that person calls our back.

02:19:41.660 --> 02:19:43.660
Maybe it didn't appreciate being grabbed.

02:19:43.660 --> 02:19:44.660
Maybe.

02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:46.660
I hit the button, and then it freaked out.

02:19:46.660 --> 02:19:47.660
Did you ask permission, Rob?

02:19:47.660 --> 02:19:53.660
If you were calling, try to get back in.

02:19:53.660 --> 02:20:00.660
In playing WoW again, I don't know if I ever told you about the webcomic that Slidekick

02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:01.660
and I came up with.

02:20:01.660 --> 02:20:02.660
About Animal Crossing?

02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:03.660
No.

02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:04.660
In WoW.

02:20:04.660 --> 02:20:05.660
Oh, in WoW.

02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:06.660
Sorry.

02:20:06.660 --> 02:20:07.660
It was called Hillsbrad Blues.

02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:08.660
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:09.660
You did mention this.

02:20:09.660 --> 02:20:11.660
I'm thinking that we might make this a happening again.

02:20:11.660 --> 02:20:13.660
Yeah, you got to work on that.

02:20:13.660 --> 02:20:15.660
But I did get the call back on the line.

02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:16.660
Hi, you're on Orange Town's radio.

02:20:16.660 --> 02:20:17.660
Who's this?

02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:18.660
Hey, this is Akdeft.

02:20:18.660 --> 02:20:19.660
Hey, Akdeft.

02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:20.660
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:20:20.660 --> 02:20:24.660
Well, the topic about the Overwatch League and all that stuff.

02:20:24.660 --> 02:20:25.660
Yeah.

02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:32.660
I want to continue more on that, but first of all, I do agree with you, and there needs

02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:35.660
to be more representation from other people.

02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:46.660
And not necessarily just like only people from other genders and that stuff.

02:20:47.660 --> 02:20:54.660
Because, again, the League is overwhelmed with people from Korea, and that's obvious

02:20:54.660 --> 02:20:58.660
because they're really good in the game, but aside from that.

02:20:58.660 --> 02:21:00.660
It's a good start.

02:21:00.660 --> 02:21:04.660
But, yeah, it's a good start and all that.

02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:10.660
But I want to talk about why women aren't in the League, probably.

02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:11.660
Okay.

02:21:11.660 --> 02:21:21.660
So, yeah, I was saying, and the League owners were saying, too, that, well, the excuses,

02:21:21.660 --> 02:21:29.660
like you said, that, well, they have to be in the same rooms, and they have to be together

02:21:29.660 --> 02:21:39.660
tons of times, and they cannot afford people from the same team being in dates, having

02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:44.660
a relationship, because in the performance-wise, it's going to be distracting.

02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:55.660
So, they cannot be, like, if, like, for example, even if a relationship, sorry, relationship

02:21:55.660 --> 02:22:01.660
moves from the League and all that stuff, if there's a breakup, there's going to be

02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:04.660
like tons of things they need to fix.

02:22:04.660 --> 02:22:08.660
So, in that sense, I do agree with that.

02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:19.660
Now, before I know, because I know that sounds like an excuse, but in sports, the same things

02:22:19.660 --> 02:22:20.660
happen.

02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:27.660
Like, for example, and this is something I relate to mostly because it's soccer, they

02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:35.660
don't have the players' spouses, their wives, like when they're going to do a big game

02:22:35.660 --> 02:22:40.660
or something like that, because it can be distracting, and they're the wives, it's not

02:22:40.660 --> 02:22:46.660
like, oh, they're going to be fighting or it's not going to be problems, but they can

02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:52.660
get distracted, and it's important for them to be on their top performance, and I can

02:22:52.660 --> 02:23:00.660
see the same thing happening with the Overwatch League, that not necessarily, like, okay,

02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:04.660
they're going to be problems, but they're going to be distracted.

02:23:04.660 --> 02:23:06.660
That's the thing.

02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:08.660
Here's my thought, Akdeft.

02:23:08.660 --> 02:23:13.660
Like, I respect your viewpoint and where you're coming from, and I understand that, you know,

02:23:13.660 --> 02:23:19.660
traditionally in other types of sports leagues, this is what's been done, but this is supposed

02:23:19.660 --> 02:23:23.660
to be, you know, something new, something, you know, esports, something kind of, you

02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:28.660
know, technology for the new generation, and, you know, you can work together professionally

02:23:28.660 --> 02:23:31.660
without having those types of circumstances.

02:23:31.660 --> 02:23:37.660
For example, Dark Sakura, myself, and Loki, we all went to PAX together a few years ago,

02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:40.660
and we all slept in the same hotel room, and do you know how much sex was had?

02:23:40.660 --> 02:23:41.660
None.

02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:42.660
That's gross.

02:23:42.660 --> 02:23:45.660
These are my professional friends that I do this show with.

02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:47.660
It's not like that at all.

02:23:47.660 --> 02:23:51.660
So my point with that is that, you know, if these guys, and hopefully girls at some point,

02:23:51.660 --> 02:23:55.660
are going to get paid to do Overwatch, you know, then they have to remember.

02:23:55.660 --> 02:24:00.660
They've got to put their Overwatch careers ahead of this other stuff, and if they get

02:24:00.660 --> 02:24:04.660
sucked into this other stuff, it could have an effect on their Overwatch careers.

02:24:04.660 --> 02:24:10.660
Just like when, what's this guy's name, XQC or whatever his name is, mouthed off, you

02:24:10.660 --> 02:24:15.660
know, it may have been something on his own Twitch stream on his own time, but unfortunately

02:24:15.660 --> 02:24:19.660
what he did had an effect on the community, and that's why he had to get shut down and

02:24:19.660 --> 02:24:25.660
get, you know, slapped on the butt about it, because he has to be professional.

02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:28.660
So if you want to be a professional player, you have to act professional.

02:24:28.660 --> 02:24:32.660
I don't think there's anything wrong with saying, okay, we're going to have boys and

02:24:32.660 --> 02:24:36.660
girls in this league, and it's expected that you act professional.

02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:41.660
If y'all want to date, okay, but at the end of the day, y'all better be able to act professional,

02:24:41.660 --> 02:24:44.660
or you're out of here.

02:24:44.660 --> 02:24:47.660
And that's the thing too, because I do agree with that.

02:24:47.660 --> 02:24:53.660
They're professionals, they're getting paid, so they have to, like, to follow the

02:24:53.660 --> 02:25:00.660
rules and all that, but again, I'm talking with Chad, and Matt is saying, I'm sorry,

02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:04.660
but I'm calling bullshit, and I agree, people should be controlling themselves.

02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:09.660
It's not only men, also the women, it can be both sides.

02:25:09.660 --> 02:25:15.660
Again, not necessarily like, oh, women have an hour to blame, because it's not the thing.

02:25:15.660 --> 02:25:19.660
But it can happen. So sorry about that.

02:25:19.660 --> 02:25:24.660
Jamie, why don't you get us, Jamie's dying to comment here, go ahead.

02:25:24.660 --> 02:25:29.660
Well, it's just the whole thing about being distracted, it, to me, stinks of the whole

02:25:29.660 --> 02:25:32.660
thing with, like, girls' dress codes in school.

02:25:32.660 --> 02:25:35.660
Oh, we don't want them to distract the boys from learning.

02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:38.660
Yeah, men can't control themselves. Yeah, I get what feels like that, yeah.

02:25:38.660 --> 02:25:43.660
If you treat a man like he can't control himself, he's going to expect to have you do the control for him.

02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:50.660
They need to be held, and even women too, we all need to be held accountable if they pull this crap,

02:25:50.660 --> 02:25:56.660
in any sport, really, and end up, you know, having a performance issue because of it,

02:25:56.660 --> 02:26:00.660
hold them the fuck accountable. No matter who it is.

02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:02.660
Treat them like a grown-up. Yeah.

02:26:02.660 --> 02:26:10.660
And something I was commenting on too, there's reports of every Olympic event,

02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:18.660
in any Olympic village, of people having sex, like, on and off, like, it's like an orgy, basically.

02:26:18.660 --> 02:26:24.660
The people cleaning the villages find many, many stuff.

02:26:24.660 --> 02:26:25.660
Yes, we'll just-

02:26:25.660 --> 02:26:27.660
Are these people who just hand out condoms?

02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:30.660
We'll let everybody fill in the gaps there, yeah.

02:26:30.660 --> 02:26:37.660
But, again, I'm going to take this back to performance, since they're doing other things

02:26:37.660 --> 02:26:41.660
other than mentally preparing for something really important.

02:26:41.660 --> 02:26:46.660
And in the case of, like, something the Overwatch League, the point I was trying to make,

02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:55.660
most of them are, what, around the 20, 23 age, so they're really young.

02:26:55.660 --> 02:27:02.660
And I'm sorry about this, but they're still young.

02:27:02.660 --> 02:27:04.660
They're still mentally children.

02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:05.660
They're stupid stuff.

02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:11.660
They're probably, and like I referenced earlier, just because there isn't any women in the league

02:27:11.660 --> 02:27:17.660
doesn't mean they aren't already hooking up, statistically, of 133 dudes.

02:27:17.660 --> 02:27:18.660
That's true.

02:27:18.660 --> 02:27:22.660
There is something, a good point, just to go into psychology in general.

02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:23.660
Sure.

02:27:23.660 --> 02:27:32.660
Women, and I can vouch for this, our minds aren't fully developed until somewhere between the age of 21 to 24.

02:27:32.660 --> 02:27:35.660
For men, it's actually 25 to 28.

02:27:35.660 --> 02:27:40.660
But we have to be careful, because we don't want that to be a pass either, like for this guy.

02:27:40.660 --> 02:27:42.660
It's not a pass, but it is a biological fact.

02:27:42.660 --> 02:27:45.660
That is something that should be borne in mind.

02:27:45.660 --> 02:27:51.660
And maybe, yes, there should be higher restrictions for that, but it still doesn't mean you can't have a co-ed team.

02:27:51.660 --> 02:27:52.660
You know.

02:27:52.660 --> 02:27:58.660
But I will give that, and it wasn't something that I thought of going into my points on that.

02:27:58.660 --> 02:28:06.660
Yes, there is much poorer impulse control, because, I mean, sorry guys, y'all's brains aren't fully developed until you're almost 30.

02:28:06.660 --> 02:28:08.660
Biological fact.

02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:10.660
We're pretty much dumb.

02:28:10.660 --> 02:28:13.660
Well, we just hope they all make good choices.

02:28:13.660 --> 02:28:21.660
But, you know, again, and I'm probably going to hear from several people throughout this week, and I already was kind of getting into, I don't want to say getting into it on Twitter.

02:28:21.660 --> 02:28:25.660
It's not like it was a fight or something, it was, you know, some dialogue on Twitter this week about this whole thing.

02:28:25.660 --> 02:28:28.660
And, you know, but I'm going to stand my ground on this.

02:28:28.660 --> 02:28:35.660
This is something I want to see us do better at, but I realize it's not something that's going to change overnight.

02:28:35.660 --> 02:28:44.660
I realize we have to make the Overwatch community more welcoming to women, but I just want to reinforce, you know, I don't hate the Overwatch League or anything like that.

02:28:44.660 --> 02:28:45.660
It's quite the contrary.

02:28:45.660 --> 02:28:56.660
I want it to succeed, but I want it to succeed big, and I just think, you know, this is going to hold it back from really truly being accessible to everybody.

02:28:56.660 --> 02:29:05.660
And once we can kind of solve some of these problems about how do we get our community lex tosic, how do we welcome more people from other countries, how do we welcome more women into this league.

02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:08.660
I just kind of think it's going to be the same old thing.

02:29:08.660 --> 02:29:14.660
It's never going to get taken seriously like any other esport, no matter how pretty it is.

02:29:14.660 --> 02:29:27.660
Yeah, I do hope for the Overwatch League because I haven't fallen it, and it's good, but I do hope for the future of it that it does expand to that.

02:29:27.660 --> 02:29:42.660
To have like co-ed teams for more people to be involved because it is something really awesome, and I would like to support it more, basically.

02:29:42.660 --> 02:29:50.660
But yeah, it needs to grow. For the first year, it will do fine, but it does need to evolve.

02:29:51.660 --> 02:29:58.660
Sorry, I'm getting my tongue twisted here. But it needs to work towards it.

02:29:58.660 --> 02:30:07.660
Again, I do agree with the point that it needs to be men and women on the same teams and all that stuff.

02:30:08.660 --> 02:30:21.660
And something that DarkSakura said earlier, oh you can make a women's league too, but no, I would actually rather have the both genders, or any gender, on the teams.

02:30:21.660 --> 02:30:29.660
Like playing together, doing stuff together, because what was the thing before Overwatch? It's cooperative, it's teamwork.

02:30:29.660 --> 02:30:31.660
You need to show that.

02:30:31.660 --> 02:30:44.660
And I think the best thing we can do, you know, how do we fix that? Well, as fans of Overwatch, and this goes for anybody who wants to see Overwatch League succeed, or for anybody who's a fan of Overwatch, or any esport, I mean really, this argument can work for any esport, not just Overwatch League.

02:30:44.660 --> 02:30:49.660
If you want to see your league do better in these types of ways, that has to start with you.

02:30:49.660 --> 02:31:01.660
And that's where you have to help in calling out this toxic behavior when you see it, and this type of stuff when dude gets on his Twitch stream and says, you know, go suck a dick, you'd probably like it, and all that stuff.

02:31:01.660 --> 02:31:11.660
You know, we don't have to end that guy's life completely, but we have to call it out and say, dude, not cool. That's not representative of the community we're trying to build here.

02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:14.660
You need to go sit in the corner and work your own shit out.

02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:16.660
You need to look at your life, look at your choices.

02:31:16.660 --> 02:31:32.660
Yeah, look at your life, look at your choices. Or, again, going back to my reality TV popes, I'll use an all-time classic that I cite oftentimes on this show because it is gospel, and that would be the book of Tyra, and that would be, learn something from this.

02:31:32.660 --> 02:31:39.660
And that's what I would say to XQC, learn something from this, we're rooting for you, we're all rooting for you.

02:31:39.660 --> 02:31:40.660
Yeah.

02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:41.660
There you go.

02:31:41.660 --> 02:31:43.660
Yeah, hopefully it comes to that.

02:31:43.660 --> 02:31:55.660
But, you know, and here's the thing, and here's why I think Overwatch League, and again, why maybe I'm being a little harsher on it than I am, oh, I don't know, say Counter-Strike or League of Legends or these other things.

02:31:55.660 --> 02:32:04.660
I've been to BlizzCon, and I did that Horde House show, and I've seen the Blizzard community, and there's all sorts of diversity within that community.

02:32:04.660 --> 02:32:21.660
There's a ton of women that play WoW, we have a show on this network hosted by two very amazing women that play World of Warcraft overseas, and they, you know, and they bring lots of men and women onto their show to talk about, you know, what's going on in Warcraft, and they know their shit when it comes to lore and all that stuff.

02:32:21.660 --> 02:32:33.660
My point is, they've got a diverse community of Blizzard. Now it's time, you know, that's how they're, I think, enabled to maybe reflect that in their esports almost more than anybody else.

02:32:33.660 --> 02:32:40.660
You know, I hope that Overwatch League looks as amazing as the audience at BlizzCon very soon.

02:32:40.660 --> 02:32:49.660
So, anyway, I'm gonna close it on that, act deaf, but thanks for the call. Hey, I appreciate their perspective, even when we don't see completely eye-to-eye, I think we have at least some common ground here.

02:32:50.660 --> 02:33:01.660
Hey, thanks for letting my opinion be fair, because I know I'm the murderer here, and I'm probably not right either, but that's the perspective I have from it.

02:33:01.660 --> 02:33:07.660
So, sorry if I offended anyone, that wasn't my intention, so, again, thanks for having me.

02:33:07.660 --> 02:33:24.660
You know what, I give you props for saying, hey, I'm trying to kind of learn, you know, maybe I'm not in the right place, so I'm trying to learn, and I understand, like, if you're driving a big rig truck down the highway, and you suddenly realize you're going the wrong way, you can't just flip a bitch in the middle of the highway and go the right way.

02:33:24.660 --> 02:33:38.660
You're gonna have to plan your way to get off the freeway and turn around, and my point is, it's not, that change that I'm screaming about earlier on the show is not gonna happen overnight, but I hope it happens, you know, eventually.

02:33:38.660 --> 02:33:41.660
So, anyway, my friend, I will see you next time, okay?

02:33:41.660 --> 02:33:42.660
See ya.

02:33:42.660 --> 02:33:43.660
See ya.

02:33:43.660 --> 02:33:44.660
Alright, buh-bye.

02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:59.660
I think that is a good call to end it on for tonight, so I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but you can always email us, participate at, excuse me, orangeslouchradio.com, I think that coughing fit is a time to say we need to throw in the towel and be done for tonight, but great show, thank you so much.

02:33:59.660 --> 02:34:01.660
Thank you, Mel B, for being here.

02:34:01.660 --> 02:34:02.660
Thank you.

02:34:02.660 --> 02:34:06.660
Thank you, Jamie, for being here, as she always is, thank you to me for being here, thank myself.

02:34:06.660 --> 02:34:07.660
You live here.

02:34:07.660 --> 02:34:08.660
Doing great.

02:34:08.660 --> 02:34:09.660
Thank you to Mr. Smoosh and Alan.

02:34:09.660 --> 02:34:12.660
Yes, thank you to Mr. Smoosh and Alan for being inspirational.

02:34:12.660 --> 02:34:15.660
Thank you to Loki for, you know, giving us some space tonight.

02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:16.660
No, I'm just kidding.

02:34:16.660 --> 02:34:17.660
Happy birthday.

02:34:17.660 --> 02:34:18.660
We miss him.

02:34:18.660 --> 02:34:19.660
Yes, happy birthday, Danny.

02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:20.660
Danny.

02:34:20.660 --> 02:34:21.660
Yes.

02:34:21.660 --> 02:34:22.660
Who's now a mature four-year-old.

02:34:22.660 --> 02:34:26.660
Well, probably more mature than some Overwatch players out there.

02:34:26.660 --> 02:34:28.660
Ah, cheap shot, cheap shot, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:29.660
Alright.

02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:30.660
Sometimes you gotta go for it.

02:34:30.660 --> 02:34:31.660
Okay.

02:34:32.660 --> 02:34:36.660
Anyway, you know, one thing I didn't get out, and I want to make sure it's clear, because

02:34:36.660 --> 02:34:39.660
I just don't want some of these things I've said to go back and haunt me a little later

02:34:39.660 --> 02:34:40.660
on.

02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:44.660
Over the time we've done this show, and I've talked a lot about how OLR has been on the

02:34:44.660 --> 02:34:48.660
year for many years, for many years and all that stuff, you know, I think the things that

02:34:48.660 --> 02:34:52.660
have come out of my mouth, I haven't always been proud of, and that's what makes listening

02:34:52.660 --> 02:34:56.660
to some of the older episodes harder to listen to, you know what I mean?

02:34:56.660 --> 02:35:02.660
Like, even I feel like I've kind of changed over the last 700 episodes and learned a lot,

02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:03.660
and that's because of many of you.

02:35:03.660 --> 02:35:09.660
Like, for example, there was a time and place, and has probably happened on this show, where

02:35:09.660 --> 02:35:14.660
I referred to something as Leo Tarted, but with a different word, okay?

02:35:14.660 --> 02:35:15.660
You all know what I'm referencing, right?

02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:20.660
And I think I've learned over the years that I probably shouldn't use that word, you know?

02:35:20.660 --> 02:35:23.660
There's just other things I could say instead of that.

02:35:23.660 --> 02:35:28.660
But again, like the big rig driving down the highway, I didn't change overnight, and

02:35:28.660 --> 02:35:30.660
I know sometimes that word still leaves our mouths.

02:35:30.660 --> 02:35:35.660
I think somebody said it on the show last week, and you know, but all we can do is kind

02:35:35.660 --> 02:35:40.660
of call that out and say, maybe I'm going to do better next time, and I'm going to try

02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:41.660
not to use that same language.

02:35:41.660 --> 02:35:45.660
So I just kind of wanted to get that out there, because I'm sure if somebody really wanted

02:35:45.660 --> 02:35:50.660
to, they could go back to episode 54 or something and find some shitty thing that I said, and

02:35:50.660 --> 02:35:53.660
you know, I'm trying to do better too.

02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:54.660
I think we all are.

02:35:54.660 --> 02:35:57.660
Life is a learning adventure, is it not?

02:35:57.660 --> 02:35:59.660
I think so.

02:35:59.660 --> 02:36:02.660
Well, sometimes it's a nightmare.

02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:04.660
But you already know everything, right, Darsara?

02:36:04.660 --> 02:36:05.660
Of course I do.

02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:07.660
All right, anyway.

02:36:07.660 --> 02:36:10.660
Oh my gosh, though.

02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:13.660
My tummy is a mess right now.

02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:18.660
Well, feel better, but the good news is we're going to wrap it up, so we can close on shop

02:36:18.660 --> 02:36:19.660
for tonight.

02:36:19.660 --> 02:36:20.660
We'll be back next week.

02:36:20.660 --> 02:36:21.660
Jamie will be here.

02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:22.660
Loki will be back.

02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:25.660
We'll talk about whatever happens in the news over the next week.

02:36:25.660 --> 02:36:27.660
Thank you guys as always for tuning into Orange Launch Radio.

02:36:27.660 --> 02:36:31.660
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, we ask please tell a friend or two about

02:36:31.660 --> 02:36:32.660
the show.

02:36:32.660 --> 02:36:35.660
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but you

02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:39.660
know, it's hard to air those voices when they're not here.

02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:43.660
But I notice we have been growing a little bit in 2018, so it's been great to see faces,

02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:44.660
old and new, here at OLR.

02:36:44.660 --> 02:36:45.660
So help us spread the word.

02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:48.660
A nice five-star review on iTunes or Google Play.

02:36:48.660 --> 02:36:52.660
That stuff goes a long way towards discoverability, let me tell you.

02:36:52.660 --> 02:36:54.660
So yeah, tell a friend, leave a nice review.

02:36:54.660 --> 02:36:55.660
It really, really helps.

02:36:55.660 --> 02:36:58.660
Thank you so much, because we don't have a million dollar website behind us or anything

02:36:58.660 --> 02:36:59.660
like that.

02:36:59.660 --> 02:37:00.660
Just us.

02:37:00.660 --> 02:37:01.660
You know what?

02:37:01.660 --> 02:37:02.660
And now we don't have a YouTube channel anymore.

02:37:02.660 --> 02:37:06.660
Well, we do, but we're not going to get any coin from it.

02:37:06.660 --> 02:37:11.660
Here's something, though, that just made me sit and realize.

02:37:11.660 --> 02:37:16.660
We are so hipster before there was hipster.

02:37:16.660 --> 02:37:18.660
No, seriously.

02:37:18.660 --> 02:37:24.660
Because the way that we do our show is just so friendly and relatively low production

02:37:24.660 --> 02:37:27.660
value for a high quality, I'd like to think.

02:37:27.660 --> 02:37:28.660
I'd like to think.

02:37:28.660 --> 02:37:29.660
Yeah.

02:37:29.660 --> 02:37:31.660
Out of 715, there's been a few stinkers.

02:37:31.660 --> 02:37:33.660
We are DIY.

02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:37.660
We are the thread banger of internet radio.

02:37:38.660 --> 02:37:44.660
And to be fair, there's a lot of people out there that are learning like we are.

02:37:44.660 --> 02:37:46.660
We've been doing it a really fucking long time.

02:37:46.660 --> 02:37:53.660
And we do what works, but we don't have to make it high production and have all the gear,

02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:59.660
although I have been looking at Wish because I found some decent equipment.

02:37:59.660 --> 02:38:02.660
We do what works for us and many of you out there.

02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:03.660
For sure.

02:38:03.660 --> 02:38:04.660
For sure.

02:38:04.660 --> 02:38:06.660
Anyway, is that a final thought?

02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:10.660
Or should I come back to you for an official final thought for the Evening Dark Sakura?

02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:17.660
My final thought is that I want a holo dress, I think.

02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:19.660
I think I want a holo dress.

02:38:19.660 --> 02:38:26.660
Actually, there is something for anyone who can find me a copy of Robert Mundu, which

02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:28.660
was Jumping Flash 3 in Japan.

02:38:28.660 --> 02:38:30.660
Let me know if you find it.

02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:32.660
Not on eBay.

02:38:32.660 --> 02:38:35.660
I want to pay under $20 for it.

02:38:35.660 --> 02:38:40.660
And my final thought is I want to have a holo deck.

02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:41.660
A holo deck.

02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:45.660
And every week in gaming, the technology brings us closer and closer to a holo deck.

02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:46.660
Okay, okay.

02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:48.660
I have something to call out right the fuck now.

02:38:48.660 --> 02:38:50.660
Right.

02:38:50.660 --> 02:38:56.660
Don't refer to humans as females and males because that's like you're talking about fucking

02:38:56.660 --> 02:38:58.660
animals, okay?

02:38:58.660 --> 02:39:07.660
Men, women, women, men, person, don't fucking talk about other humans like they're animals.

02:39:07.660 --> 02:39:10.660
For those that may not know, is that just like a personal thing?

02:39:10.660 --> 02:39:12.660
Like some people hate the word moist?

02:39:12.660 --> 02:39:16.660
Or what is it about that word that is uncomfortable?

02:39:16.660 --> 02:39:18.660
It's just rude.

02:39:18.660 --> 02:39:19.660
Why?

02:39:19.660 --> 02:39:20.660
Because-

02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:22.660
I'm asking from a place of education.

02:39:22.660 --> 02:39:27.660
It's like when you see someone says, oh, well, the females are doing this.

02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:30.660
You're making us sound like we're fucking animals.

02:39:30.660 --> 02:39:31.660
Women.

02:39:31.660 --> 02:39:32.660
Say it easy.

02:39:32.660 --> 02:39:33.660
Women.

02:39:33.660 --> 02:39:34.660
All right.

02:39:34.660 --> 02:39:36.660
Not fucking hard.

02:39:36.660 --> 02:39:37.660
All right.

02:39:37.660 --> 02:39:38.660
Okay.

02:39:38.660 --> 02:39:39.660
All right.

02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:44.660
The tangents and more on another episode of Orange Lounge Radio in the future.

02:39:44.660 --> 02:39:45.660
All right.

02:39:45.660 --> 02:39:46.660
We'll be back to do it in seven days, you guys.

02:39:46.660 --> 02:39:47.660
Have a great week.

02:39:47.660 --> 02:39:50.660
We will see you next time here at OLR.

02:39:50.660 --> 02:39:51.660
