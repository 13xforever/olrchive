00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week Nintendo has announced that Miitomo is joining everybody votes in the digital information ether. Be sure to save your decorations for posterity.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight we're going back to the past but in a new new way. Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.000 --> 00:48.000
Live tonight episode number 716 for this January the 28th of 2018. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter as Skye.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
Joining me, not tonight, unfortunately DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She has the night off. She wasn't feeling too well.

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
As you all know she had some things a few weeks ago and I think she had a very busy day yesterday. I know she went to San Francisco.

01:02.000 --> 01:11.000
I think something involved with her sister's thing that she's involved with. So she probably needed today to relax so we'll support that.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
But coming back to the show this week. I guess they're flip flopping this month. Coming back to the show tonight, Tech Master Loki.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Hello. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing alright. Good. How was the kids birthday?

01:21.000 --> 01:30.000
It was good. We just went and had some food over at Olive Garden. I wish somebody would do that for my birthday.

01:30.000 --> 01:39.000
Well yeah, I mean he just wanted presents so he got his presents. He got Power Rangers. He's been getting in the Power Rangers. Shane would be proud.

01:40.000 --> 01:51.000
So his favorite thing now is Power Rangers Ninja of Steel and Samurai. It's not the latest. I think it's one of them.

01:51.000 --> 02:00.000
Because I think Megaforce is the latest one because it has all of them. It's sad that I know now about Power Rangers. I mean this is not sad but I'm starting to learn.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Something you never thought would happen.

02:03.000 --> 02:13.000
But yeah, he's really into it now so he got a couple of the Ranger toys for his birthday. Then my dad came over and he's like what is he like.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
I'm like well he likes Power Rangers, Ninja Steel stuff. So he ended up getting the Megazord thing which is exactly what he wanted.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh cool. Oh cool that worked out because we were looking for the other thing but this is what they had.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
Nice. Yeah he's been playing with that. So yeah it went alright. It was just very low key. We didn't really do anything.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
Good. Well we held down the fort best we could. I don't know if you heard the playback at all but we had an interview with an old friend.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
The show Mel B was here via Skype last week and he was promoting the DDR freestyle tournament which happened on Saturday.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
So his freestyle takeover happened and come to find out at the last minute they needed another judge because things happened.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Somebody wasn't able to make it so they actually reached out to me to see if I would judge it.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
And I was really honored but admittedly I was a little scared about judging because I'm kind of like well I wasn't really a big freestyler.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
Everybody else on the panel was a big freestyler. But then I also thought well does Simon Cowell sing? I don't think he does.

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
No. And I am really good at judging people. I do it a lot in my personal life. So yeah I did it and I had a lot of fun.

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
I was wondering like would my list match up with everybody else's but the good news is I picked the same winner that actually won.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
So I guess I was on the same page after all. So it was good. But the tournament was good. I just want to give a shout out to everybody involved.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
There was only about 9 people that entered which isn't quite maybe where Arcade Infinity was back in the day.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
But I kind of see it as like a really good start to hopefully revitalize it. Like you got to start somewhere right?

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
Well to be fair it's kind of like a renaissance now to come back because it's not what it was back then.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
No. Not yet but it could get back there based on what we saw at the tournament.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
So I know they've been talking about doing it again soon and I hope they do.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
And I think one thing that probably really encourages them is the big turnout on Twitch.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
They had a pretty decent turnout on Twitch just from everybody around being able to check it out.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
And even if there wasn't a ton of in competition routines to see. 9 isn't bad though.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
There was a lot of exhibition stuff. Like a lot of the people who used to do it back in the day kind of got back up on the machine.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
No I didn't do it. I just wasn't really prepared to do that. So I didn't.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
But a lot of the people that are better at dancing than I did got up there and did it and it was fun to watch.

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
So I really do hope they kind of keep pushing the freestyle thing and do it again when they're talking about doing it again.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
I would really encourage if it's possible to maybe do stuff at conventions. That's what I'm going to kind of give them as feedback.

04:51.000 --> 04:59.000
Go to conventions. If MagWest comes back see if you can't do some type of freestyle exhibition thing in the arcade at MagWest.

04:59.000 --> 05:08.000
Or California Extreme or some of these other conventions. Kind of let people see film. Get the new movies out there and it'll just build up from there.

05:08.000 --> 05:15.000
I did see some of you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com where we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
vognetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. I did see some of the chatters in the Twitch room.

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
So I know y'all are getting around so that's good. I'm reading chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Dar Tetsuya said Rob's American Idol reference makes me think of the only other DDR tournament I ever entered.

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
Mel B did a really good Randy Jackson. Yes. Well back when freestyle was first starting American Idol had just started.

05:42.000 --> 05:52.000
So a lot of those jokes weren't really tired yet. Bobby Black Wolf asks where was the Rob exhibition? About 30 pounds ago.

05:52.000 --> 06:00.000
Let's see. S.G.O. 100 Matt says I watched it after the fact. Well yep that's the great thing about archives you can watch whenever you want.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
And S.G.O. 100 Matt continues it's funny that so many of my West Coast friends were at that tournament. Yeah honestly that was the best part.

06:07.000 --> 06:17.000
It really was with seeing all these people I hadn't seen in years. Like oh hey you got married and have kids now and oh hey I haven't seen you in like actually like 10 years.

06:17.000 --> 06:26.000
Even though we follow each other on Twitter we only maybe live two hours apart. I actually joked to somebody I said this is like the high school reunion that I want to go to.

06:26.000 --> 06:33.000
That's what yesterday really felt like was like this is the high school reunion I want to go to but then it's like you're mixed in with the current class.

06:34.000 --> 06:46.000
But it was good it was good getting to see the future and the past and I guess the present as well of DDR freestyle and it's it's really neat seeing this whole DDR thing kind of getting a bit of a renaissance.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
Like you know I have to be honest I have nothing but respect for the people that are doing Perfect Attack and doing those tournaments and I know there's great talent over there.

06:54.000 --> 07:03.000
But the reality is it's really hard for me to follow because it's like I I'm not at a stamina or physical level where I can do that anymore. You know.

07:03.000 --> 07:17.000
Yeah I completely understand. I know we'll get to that in a minute. But the freestyle stuff I mean not that I don't know if I could get in that but there's there's a showmanship and there's a showing us the freestyle stuff that's very very you know attracting.

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
There was people that the nice thing about round one it has like all these like glass fronts around the building. So there were people in the DDR machines right in the front.

07:24.000 --> 07:33.000
So like there were these people that were randomly shopping in the mall and they'd be kind of looking through the glass and suddenly they're peering through the glass like it's those old Mervyn's commercials open open open right.

07:33.000 --> 07:45.000
Yes the whole thing. And then like apparently as I understand it when there would be cheering and clapping because somebody did an awesome like leg drop or something like the people downstairs shopping at Macy's or some shit would be like turning around like what the hell's going on up there type of thing.

07:45.000 --> 08:05.000
So it was cool that it got that attention from you know normals. So now looking for more comments over at chat live dot vog network dot com dark to see and chat says yeah that's what I said I lost count of the times I heard I count the times I said wow I haven't heard that name in years.

08:05.000 --> 08:20.000
Let's see. Bobby says if I wasn't watching on my PS4 I would have chatted more. I think all I did was press F to pay respects once. Was that what was the joke. Was that when the maple syrup fell over. I don't know if you guys saw that. I don't think that made the stream.

08:20.000 --> 08:33.000
But why was there maple syrup involved in this tournament. So Captain Canada. Do you remember that name from back in the day. I vaguely remember that. Well he was one of the guys that organized this tournament. He did one of the exhibitions and he went all out and he did.

08:33.000 --> 08:48.000
He did maple syrup shots before getting up on there and then he had his big instead of like the Avengers Captain America shield there's like a Canadian version with a maple leaf. Yes. And then I don't know why but I don't remember his handle from back in the day Ryan.

08:48.000 --> 08:57.000
I don't know what his handle was was sitting in there in the audience with a make America great again hat and was like booing and screaming and then like at the end of the routine Captain Canada kicked his ass.

08:58.000 --> 09:09.000
And it was it was funny like it was it's one of those like you had to be there was really far you had to be on Twitch. It was funny I got a kick out of it and it was yeah it was fun to watch but that's why there was maple syrup at this tournament.

09:09.000 --> 09:20.000
Okay. Why not Loki. Why not. Because maple syrup and dance pads. It's just like no. Yeah. Yeah. And when it spilled away somebody better clean that up quick. Oh my gosh.

09:20.000 --> 09:36.000
Orange right asks is it archived. Yeah it's archived the Twitch name is which is funny I think it's Captain Canada's Twitch but his Twitch name is Gabby J like the super punch out. I think it's Gabby underscore J and all the archives are there I was watching some of it like briefly very briefly earlier.

09:37.000 --> 09:54.000
S 200 Matt in chat also says so your first impressions around one Rob I've actually been before that was not my first time around when I've actually been several times the one in San Jose I've been to four or five times the one in Concord just as many so yeah I actually I sadly didn't play a lot.

09:54.000 --> 10:07.000
Should we get one over here. Oh here in SAC. There's rumors that they are looking at it. So we'll see. I mean rumors are rumors but they're out there that it may go in South Sacramento of all places.

10:07.000 --> 10:17.000
So and I'm thinking it's probably the new Delta shores still has some space to try to fill up so that might be where they're looking to put in it which would be very interesting. So we'll see. I mean I would I would love it.

10:17.000 --> 10:29.000
But yeah they're growing they are opening more of them so I hope they do make their way to Sacramento. That'd be rad. But in the meantime a trip to a trip to almost said Chico a trip to Concord isn't that bad to go to round one.

10:29.000 --> 10:39.000
So it's only about an hour. So OK. So there are some DDR that happened yesterday and I do just want to make sure I give snaps to all the organizers and all the people that participated getting up there and do their thing.

10:39.000 --> 10:51.000
So yeah it was great. Thanks. Thank you for creating the high school reunion. I was happy to go to as opposed to the one I literally took a nap instead of going to Loki.

10:51.000 --> 11:02.000
Yes. So you've also had a busy week when it comes to dance dance revolution. Yeah. We're throwing it back to episode one. Hell yeah a little bit. Yeah. So OK. So what happened in your world this week. So why didn't you make the tournament.

11:02.000 --> 11:16.000
Well it's actually well even as far as last week. So last week I went and looked at a dance dance revolution machine that a private seller was selling and I made the decision to purchase said machine.

11:16.000 --> 11:29.000
So yesterday I got a U-Haul truck went up there with a couple of friends and we went and brought the machine back to my garage. So now I am the owner of a dance dance revolution extreme machine.

11:29.000 --> 11:42.000
Living the dream 16 years later owning a DDR. I know it's just it's ridiculous. So apparently from what I get from what the seller said he said that it originally came from the Santa Cruz beach boardwalk.

11:42.000 --> 11:52.000
I thought it was from their arcade but I don't think it was. It may have been actually on the boardwalk somewhere. Oh interesting. It is a little sun faded on the like marquee and stuff.

11:52.000 --> 12:03.000
Yeah. It was a third Korean machine I think that got bootleg upgraded to downgrade that shit. You know I think it got upgraded to an extreme because the market you go backwards.

12:03.000 --> 12:18.000
Well it is fucking rad if it's bootleg. It's maybe if it's bootleg you can usually they have. Now you can get a DVD drive and hook it up to it and they have what's called a super disk that has 12 mixes on it.

12:19.000 --> 12:30.000
I'm assuming third cream is one of them. So you could do some of that stuff. But yeah or fourth mix with the Korean stuff. I would accept that as well.

12:30.000 --> 12:40.000
I've got all I've got a lot of DDR mix CDs and cassettes so like I have I used to collect those back when I was trying to rip songs and stuff from.

12:40.000 --> 12:48.000
So I have like fourth mix fifth mix. I'm sure I've got Mac. Do you know why you need a third Korean. Do you know why you need a third Korean.

12:55.000 --> 13:07.000
The song is so good. So good. Actually a lot of the Korean songs. There's a lot of my favorite. Originally. So I think that's what it was supposed to be. So it was he said it was a Korean cab.

13:08.000 --> 13:24.000
But I don't know. So whatever it was there it ended up in a cellar or an owner in Antioch for a while. And then the guy bought it who he has this huge arcade collection like three rooms full of like 19 cabinets and stuff.

13:24.000 --> 13:38.000
And he's got like a police 9 1 1 machine and like gauntlet dark legacy and area 51 and a bunch of Star Wars pinball machines and stuff. And so he wants to get more machines but there's this thing takes a way too much room.

13:38.000 --> 13:45.000
So he's getting rid of that and a bunch of other machines to make room for that. You know he can talk to about changing the mix on your machine.

13:45.000 --> 13:57.000
Our guest from last week because he's he he has he has the fully realized garage arcade dream. Now is it. But you've said this is not a start to like. No. My wife is not happy.

13:57.000 --> 14:07.000
How is how is the wife dealing with this because that was my first thing was like how did Loki convince the wife. This is I asked. She said yes reluctantly but I'll take it.

14:08.000 --> 14:26.000
It was still yes. So yes. So no it's so like I said you know I it's in the garage. It's not really taking up space in the house. I know she wanted to park her car in the garage. It's the garage is not ready to park a car in yet. And honestly the way I set it up you can park a car in the garage still.

14:26.000 --> 14:42.000
It's so we just small car. Well one car. I mean we just need to I'm I put it facing my garage door instead of facing sideways like you would think against the wall for a couple of reasons one so that I can get into the back if I want to to do work on it or whatever.

14:42.000 --> 14:54.000
And two it's narrower with wise than it is length. So I just went ahead and put it that way so that if when I do clean up the garage you can park a car in there and have a deep air machine.

14:54.000 --> 15:08.000
The other thing is the guy that had it before the last guy he put it in an LCD screen. So it has an LCD screen instead of an actual CRT which made it a lot lighter to move because that thing fucking is heavy.

15:08.000 --> 15:19.000
Yeah those are heavy cabinets. I'm sure but but also the sun fading probably impacted the old monitor that was in there and the LCD probably doesn't get affected by that or it's it got out of the sun.

15:20.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah it's yeah it's kind of rigged up. It's all right. It cuts off the bottom of the screen but it looks like I can probably adjust it. But the big thing that that's what that's important is because if down the road I want to turn it into a step mania machine.

15:36.000 --> 15:46.000
It's gonna be fucking easy to do it because I'm not going to need really the hardware to convert the signal over because it's just straight VGA gotcha. So that'll be awesome.

15:46.000 --> 15:58.000
How much of your machine have you actually got to play. I played for 30 minutes yesterday. Good. And like it here and there the kids have been hogging it. They've been playing as much as they can. I guess there's worse things the kids could be doing.

15:58.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah. So we put in the unlock codes because the guy that had it before me he didn't first I didn't know anything about it like he's like didn't know that there was more songs than what was initially on him like dude you know you can like change the sort and there's like a whole bunch of like hundred extra songs that you haven't seen before.

16:13.000 --> 16:23.000
And I'm like and you don't even have the unlock code in here. So there's like 30 more songs that are on that. So what. I had no idea you could do that. And like when I tested it I played doubles. He's like I didn't know you could do that.

16:23.000 --> 16:40.000
Like how long have you had this machine. So he wasn't loving it. No he didn't love that machine Loki. You love that machine. Yeah. I mean it's all right. This is Loki's leg lamp.

16:40.000 --> 16:57.000
No it's good. I mean I I couldn't. The price was great. I mean I didn't spend a lot of money on it. So it was a stroke of luck that I got it because there was other people interested in that one guy that was ahead of me because of what I said OK yeah I want to get it.

16:57.000 --> 17:06.000
Or can I look at it. He's like OK well there's someone else that's interested. If they wanted them they're going to take it but they're going to see if it fits in their cabin in Lake Tahoe.

17:06.000 --> 17:17.000
And so they came back and they're like no it doesn't fit in their cabin. So I was like whoa is this going to work out. You know and then so I went looked at it I'm like OK is this really busted.

17:17.000 --> 17:26.000
And he's all well the only thing that's wrong with it is this lights burnt out on there. There's one of the marquee lights. No it was burnt out. Funny enough I get it home.

17:26.000 --> 17:44.000
You know it tried changing the light bulb. No no no. It wasn't burnt out. The cord wasn't plugged in all the way. So he didn't love that machine Loki. It was neglected. It was fine. I mean there's other things that need to be fixed on it like some but like one of the push buttons needs to be the thing needs to be replaced.

17:45.000 --> 17:59.000
I can do that super easy. And then the pads on the left hand side are not sensitive anymore. So like I fail songs on the left side but when I play on the right side I don't fail those songs. So it's there are sensors that need to be replaced or tweaks.

17:59.000 --> 18:09.000
I'm going to do the foam pad modification to it to make it more sensitive to see if that'll fix it. If not just replace the sensors in it. And then the marquee.

18:09.000 --> 18:24.000
It looks like it's it. It was printed out and I think it's got water damage to it because it looks all weird. I mean it's fine but do you want a DDR second mix Mark. No I don't know. I'm good. We have one hanging in the studio for those that we have a DDR second mix marquee.

18:24.000 --> 18:43.000
I don't need a second. But no there's like small things. I mean it's it's it's absolutely minor for like what I'm playing. I can't. I'm not trying to triple a song right now. There's no fucking way that's going to happen. I'm like I got to go back to playing single pad you know single pad stuff for the six.

18:43.000 --> 18:53.000
You know that's because I am just out of shape. So it's a really good thing. I mean this is the one plus about me not owning a home like I know that's supposed to be the American dream and all and Loki owns a home.

18:53.000 --> 19:05.000
Our soccer owns a home. I don't own a home but I do worry if I did own the home I'd be filling it up with all this shit like even worse than both of you. And she has like nine pinball machines.

19:05.000 --> 19:23.000
And now you have a DDR machine. I'm the only one. You know what I have two little classic arcade machines that I bought at what are the Jamie bought me at Wal-Mart because I wanted them and that I have since put the official in this last week the pop vinyl RuPaul's drag race collection on top of.

19:23.000 --> 19:31.000
So when you walk into my house in the garage you now see drag queens and video games and it's like it me someday someday.

19:31.000 --> 19:44.000
Yeah I know something like a 2D X or something. Yeah. Oh don't tease me. Be fun. Yeah. All right. So when's the big party. When are we all coming over to play. I guess come over whenever you want. Nice.

19:44.000 --> 19:57.000
I'll be there tomorrow. No just kidding. We'll figure something out. I'll be fun. Yeah. Well we should do like a live stream from your garage. Some point they'll be fine. Thankfully like all the shots that we have in the garage right now have been the clean side because everything's pushed to the other side.

19:58.000 --> 20:10.000
Have you seen my office where I do my twitch broadcast from it's like there's the one little clean bubble and then there's just stuff everywhere. It's it's fine to tell that television is an illusion Loki.

20:11.000 --> 20:28.000
So it's I honestly it's not that cluttered. It's just it's video game stuff that's in there. I've got my like rock band stuff. I've got boxes of equipment I had from one I had. We had a game room set up at my old work so I've got like all the cables and stuff for that and just like parts and things.

20:28.000 --> 20:44.000
So if it's something I can get cleaned up out of there it's just right now I haven't gotten a chance to but I we're doing like Loki I am not one to judge over a messy home. I'm really really not. So I know your garage can have as much crap this way like all the minor things aside.

20:44.000 --> 21:02.000
I don't fucking care because this is your machine. It fucking works. It's not broken as like this stuff and it's yours. No seriously the stuff I was looking at at that price before was like it was a broken broken techno motion machine that need a ton of work and like monitor was missing and stuff like that.

21:02.000 --> 21:12.000
This is a machine that's actually in great. I think it's been pretty great condition just neglected it just minor shit. I mean I can deal with minor shit. That's fine.

21:13.000 --> 21:25.000
So all right. Well I still Loki I just I'm going to throw this out there. The biggest regret for me personally this goes back to the whole where's Rob's arcade was when I saw that Burger Time machine at the Roseville auction. I didn't buy it.

21:25.000 --> 21:33.000
That's that's my biggest regret in life. I try not to have many regrets but not buying that Burger Time machine is one of them. So I'm glad you fully realized your dream Loki.

21:34.000 --> 21:49.000
I mean yeah this is pretty much the end game. So like my wife's like well what the next thing it's just going to be bigger and bigger and bigger. I'm like no this is what I wanted. Like when I built it when I built the first arcade cabinet was to convert into a DVR machine when I got the candy cab is to make a DVR machine.

21:50.000 --> 22:00.000
It's like it's always been to make a DVR machine. I have a DVR machine. Don't need to make a DVR machine. There it is. There it is. It's done. There it is. Now you just have to you know make a game. Now. Yeah.

22:01.000 --> 22:09.000
All right. We're going to move on. That was a lot of DVR talk. But the good kind you know is good. It's been been a long time since we were a DVR focused show.

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
Memories. All right. Let's talk about the actual kickoff topic we were supposed to talk about tonight because we are all about all types of video games.

22:17.000 --> 22:31.000
Loki's give it give us a new story here to start us off. So about Facebook. Yeah. So Facebook's trying to get into the game streaming business. So you know they're working on creating a competitor to like twitch or like maybe YouTube gaming.

22:31.000 --> 22:39.000
They're saying that right now they're exploring different options for monetization leaving out mixer as a competitor shade button.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Just just just an observation. Go ahead.

22:44.000 --> 23:02.000
Well they're saying that you know I guess the they have a pilot program they're playing on using I guess the existing technology that Facebook has and they said they also wanted to use the Oculus as one of their streaming platforms using like for VR games or something like that.

23:02.000 --> 23:21.000
So it's interesting. However though I'm still a little concerned because you know Facebook does you know apparently has the exclusive streaming rights for the ESL and broadcasting the Dota 2 stuff and apparently wasn't all that great.

23:21.000 --> 23:39.000
And on top of that you know they've been kind of doing a smackdown on people that have been broadcasting on their own on Twitch because you know like in TV you know certain channels get the rights to exclusive rights to broadcast like the NFL or you know NBA or stuff like that.

23:39.000 --> 23:56.000
And so because this is the Internet it's still not really different in that respect. However it's kind of conflicting based off of what they've said before where oh yeah anybody can broadcast these you know Dota TV things but so some people are not happy that their channels have gotten banned.

23:56.000 --> 24:09.000
But you just can't do it to a competitor either. Yeah. Yeah. So because they really don't like it when you stream like NFL games or the worst is the pay per view events like don't don't try streaming those to Twitch. You will get banned for that and it's not good.

24:09.000 --> 24:17.000
Yeah. So apparently like they have like some screenshots of like what it looked like. It was just looks like a garbled mess.

24:17.000 --> 24:33.000
Well I thought Facebook kind of did some game streaming as it is. I know especially with Blizzard they have the Facebook stuff built in there and once in a great while I will see friends streaming maybe like Overwatch or Heroes of the Storm or something on to Facebook.

24:33.000 --> 25:00.000
But I don't think that's really maybe caught on as big as Facebook would hope. It's kind of it's like right in the middle of the feed with oh so and so's recent cat picture and so and so's moral outrage about something like Facebook like their feet is jacked up if you're not using like some sort of external thing to fix it because like I'll go and find something it's like oh hey that's pretty cool and I'll scroll down the screen or something and scroll back up and it's like oh now it reshuffled everything and now that story is gone.

25:00.000 --> 25:21.000
It's like great. So I mean they need I think if they're going to do a streaming platform that they need to separate it off like another section of you know streaming or gaming or something like that that's like completely separate that you can find all that because just finding your feet is going to be really hard to engage in people and if they want to like do it like twitch.

25:22.000 --> 25:48.000
Discover abilities a huge part of why I think which has been so successful is that you know it's it's pretty easy to you know categorize what you're doing and have the ability to be discovered especially since twitch launched the community thing and I really wish they integrate the community thing better into the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one versions of the app but it's probably just not their highest priority right now.

25:48.000 --> 26:11.000
But yeah discover abilities really big on twitch and to as much as I hit the shade button on mixer earlier you know I still think mixer as a platform from a technological standpoint has a lot of awesome stuff like I love that you get the credits for watching things and I think the discover ability in some ways and mixer is is actually almost a little better because mixer really likes to feature up and comers in a particular section of their website as well.

26:11.000 --> 26:30.000
It's just that mixer hasn't caught that wave yet you know it doesn't have everybody on a lot of big names so they're not honestly like with twitch I don't really go to twitch to watch anything like it's not like a YouTube or anything like that for me it's more of what is better than YouTube for me YouTube's at the bottom of the barrel for me but that's me personally.

26:30.000 --> 26:55.000
Well I don't really watch live streams I mean I watch pre tape live streams I guess but I don't watch a ton of live streams on YouTube but for me it's like I won't go to twitch unless I'm watching like you know awesome games done quick or something like that that I know is going to be there you know it's not like I'm going to go watch somebody on twitch I don't really have anybody I follow that broadcasts really frequently on twitch.

26:55.000 --> 27:24.000
Over in chat at live.vognetwork.com actdef says I know people that stream games on Facebook how how do they did what do they get out of it do they just like to show off to their friends or are they getting discovered by others or I mean are they happy with it I guess I guess if they're still doing it they are but I'm kind of curious about that actdef and looking at some other comments over at live.vognetwork.com fantaz in chat says people actually watch mixer I know they do I'm just being shady and it is it is integrated integrated well.

27:24.000 --> 27:43.000
Into the Xbox one obviously you would hope that it is and I do appreciate that even though Microsoft has mixer they haven't tried to be shady about like blocking twitch or YouTube or other ways to do it I do appreciate and applaud Microsoft for not being shitty about that if that makes sense.

27:43.000 --> 28:00.000
Oh and the other thing I think is really cool about mixer that I thought twitch would have stolen by now but is the whole co streaming where you do the the multiple points of view all at once I mean it can get a little chaotic with the audio but I think if you know you do it right like those could be a lot of fun to I would like to do more.

28:00.000 --> 28:09.000
They should do the audio similar to how they did it with awesome games done quick where they have like you know this one has the audio source the rest are just you know video.

28:09.000 --> 28:25.000
actdef in chat points out their fan pages it's a regional gaming group and have streams for Xbox and Nintendo stuff Tigerclaw in chat says you can stream games on Periscope I didn't I didn't realize that I mean it makes sense I kind of forgot about Periscope.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Yeah.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
But anyway.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
All right.

28:28.000 --> 28:47.000
So we'll see how Facebook does with this again I have concerns I just I think Facebook's trying to get its hands in a lot of pots and I think there's a there's an interesting I think kind of backlash coming for Facebook I mean we all we all have those couple friends of ours that have deleted their accounts by now if you're not one of them.

28:47.000 --> 28:59.000
I'm sure we have listeners who left Facebook a long time ago or don't use it because you know there is a lot of crap on there and there's a lot of you know weird social interactions that happened there that don't happen in real life.

28:59.000 --> 29:09.000
What I mean is people leave comments to other people you wouldn't say to somebody's face in real life and I think a lot of people are starting to realize that some of that on Facebook is kind of toxic in a way.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Yeah.

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
And you know what was it Tim Cook had recently said Tim Cook is what you know the CEO of Apple.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
He said he wouldn't let his nephew use social media or something like that.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
I mean that's pretty bad.

29:20.000 --> 29:31.000
And one of the guys that used to work at Facebook has kind of expressed regret for some of the stuff like some of these tech giants are starting to come out and say maybe maybe the monster we built.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
Maybe what was it called in Terminator maybe that this wasn't such a good idea after all.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Cyberdyne.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
Cyberdyne yeah maybe maybe face face a dyne wasn't the best idea after all.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
So or what was it.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
No it wasn't the site it was cyber dyne was the name of the company it was.

29:48.000 --> 29:55.000
Why can't I remember somebody and somebody in chat will remember over at live dog and network dot com dungeon bus guy next guy.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Yes guy that is.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Took me a sec.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
That's that's the beauty of having a live chat room.

30:01.000 --> 30:06.000
They're here to correct us when our old brains can't remember from a movie from there's a lot of knowledge up there.

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
So I think sometimes pushes out the it knows how to fix the DDR machine but it forgot about Skynet.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
All right.

30:14.000 --> 30:21.000
Anyway let's get into talking a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Loki I'll start with you.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
How was your gaming week.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.000
So aside from I did play a little bit DDR extreme obviously.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
So I played you know quite a few songs.

30:30.000 --> 30:39.000
It's funny like going back and playing that like there's a lot of songs I'm like I didn't remember that being on DDR extreme like I thought that they got rid of that song after Max 2 or something.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
You know there's a lot of like crossover songs that I was like oh yeah.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Was that on there.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I thought that wasn't on there.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
So that's kind of interesting just to go back and see all that stuff.

30:49.000 --> 31:05.000
But yeah I'm trying my goal is to play at least 30 minutes a day that you know for exercise because and honestly right now that's about all I can handle which is it's sad that I've gotten to this point but I mean I've got it.

31:05.000 --> 31:12.000
This is one of the reasons why I got a DDR machines because it's no I know it's something that I would be able to stick with.

31:12.000 --> 31:18.000
So that's the whole point is just exercise in any exercise better than no exercise.

31:18.000 --> 31:30.000
So that's my goal is to work on that and hopefully be able to actually play more like I used to maybe after a year or two of doing that.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
And then of course you know non DDR stuff.

31:32.000 --> 31:43.000
I did play well still kind of DDR related I played some step mania because I downloaded on my PC just to kind of mess around with and that's so fun.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Non DDR related stuff.

31:44.000 --> 31:52.000
I've been playing Stardew Valley still and it's all right.

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
I don't know. It's just a grind but at least it's it seems like it's somewhat entertaining.

31:57.000 --> 32:16.000
It's for me it seems like it's a good mix of like almost Animal Crossing with Minecraft and I guess maybe Harvest Moon but I've never played Harvest Moon so it's just I don't know it's entertaining or relaxing I guess it's not a whole lot to it.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
So I've been doing that and then.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
I don't know that's it. I haven't really been playing too many mobile games this week either.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
All right. Let's see over. I want to respond to this at live dot vog network dot com.

32:28.000 --> 32:34.000
Going back just a little bit but S.H.A. 100 Matt in chat says I stream last night but only one person came to watch.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
I kind of stream so infrequently that I understand if I don't get too many viewers.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
But to be honest I don't do it for views.

32:40.000 --> 32:45.000
I mostly want to do it to share the things that I like with my friends and like minded folks.

32:45.000 --> 32:53.000
You're in the right mindset S.H.A. 100 Matt. If you get into anything regarding content creation expecting to make 500 views out the gate.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
You're only going to be disappointed. Like let me tell you from having done this show for 15 years.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
There have been episodes where we have six listeners.

33:01.000 --> 33:08.000
There have been episodes where we had six thousand listeners and it's gone up and down and all around over the years.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
You know we've been kind of fortunate to see both sides of it all.

33:11.000 --> 33:18.000
But at the end of the day here doing OLR it's really about you know you guys the loyal folks that we have showing up every Sunday.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.000
Getting to hang out with Loki and Jamie and just like kind of putting the content out there I think kind of all comes together.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
We just do it because it's fun. It's a thing to do on Sunday. Exactly. Exactly.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
So that's and I know that's kind of where your mind is that S.H.A. 100 Matt but I'm kind of sharing this for everybody.

33:31.000 --> 33:38.000
But if you want to like grow your audience I think one of the easiest best ways to do that especially on Twitch is support other people.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
You know what I mean by that is follow other accounts.

33:42.000 --> 33:48.000
You know even if you can only host your one viewer when you're done for somebody else do it because people will recognize that stuff.

33:48.000 --> 33:55.000
And then you know you make other friends that broadcast maybe one of these days when they're done with a stream they'll send their viewers to you.

33:55.000 --> 34:03.000
You guys might remember you know I don't I don't have a huge Twitch presence because my main focus has been on podcasting and I've kept trying and trying to do the Twitch thing.

34:03.000 --> 34:09.000
But it's gone back to doing three podcasts a week which is you know that's that's a lot of my time. I'm very happy with it.

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
I feel like I'm creating a variety of content again which was something that was really missing from last year.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
So you know I'm I'm happy but I don't have a huge audience on Twitch and that's OK.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
But you guys might remember one night after the show I was doing Cuphead right.

34:21.000 --> 34:27.000
And some random guy playing Cuphead dumped 73 viewers on me like you know at one point which is a lot of viewers for my stream.

34:27.000 --> 34:35.000
So you just never know when something's going to hit. But a big part of it is just like getting out there doing it doing it regularly supporting other people.

34:35.000 --> 34:41.000
At some point you will be noticed and that one viewer may turn into five viewers which may not seem like a huge number.

34:41.000 --> 34:47.000
But it's five times what you had before. Yeah. So you know it'll it'll happen.

34:47.000 --> 34:54.000
Just keep at it. And I you know I kind of have to remind myself of this advice too because I've been very bad about doing the Twitch thing regularly.

34:54.000 --> 35:01.000
But you know I've chosen to stick more with podcasts is what I what's what I know it's what I'm I think I'm good at.

35:01.000 --> 35:11.000
So you know and I feel really good about what's going on with here with what I do for our reading is fundamental even though I'm you know not the producer of that show I feel good about what I'm contributing there.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
And then shaking and crying which you know I promoted on the show last week.

35:14.000 --> 35:20.000
I just I'm having great feelings about that show. It's really really good to be doing that show with Victoria and I've gotten some good feedback on that.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
So yeah.

35:24.000 --> 35:31.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry radio at vog network dot com use the pass phrase root.

35:31.000 --> 35:36.000
I guess I kind of got on a tangent there but that's OK. That was an important comment over at live dot vog network dot com.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
I'm also trying to catch up on other chats over at live dot vog network dot com.

35:40.000 --> 35:46.000
Act-deft in chat says the same happens for me and my podcast. We don't get more than like 20 views on YouTube.

35:47.000 --> 35:57.000
But I like talking about stuff. Well you know what 20 people would still fill a small room that's still like a well attended meeting.

35:57.000 --> 36:03.000
You know so that's that's pretty good. You know 20 is nothing to be ashamed of whatsoever.

36:03.000 --> 36:11.000
You know find find the find the joy in the small audiences and it sounds like you do. I'm just you know reiterating that for maybe people who don't.

36:11.000 --> 36:17.000
Let's see over at chat live dot vog network dot com. Act-deft points out GFM cast.

36:17.000 --> 36:23.000
It's in Spanish. Hence why I don't really promote here that much. Well hey if we have Spanish speakers out there go to GFM cast.

36:23.000 --> 36:30.000
There you go. Free plug. There you go. That's that's how knowing people will help out sometimes.

36:30.000 --> 36:37.000
Bobby Black Wolf says that's more people than attended some of vog's dragon con panels. 20 people.

36:37.000 --> 36:44.000
That's absolutely right. That's absolutely right. We've had less people that show up in person for a vog panel and it happens.

36:44.000 --> 36:51.000
We still did the best panel we could and we had a lot of fun and we may have been sober or not but we had a really good time.

36:51.000 --> 36:57.000
So I always have a great time at Dragon Con. OK. My gaming week over at live dot vog network dot com.

36:57.000 --> 37:03.000
In chat if you want to chat along with the show. Honestly see my gaming week wasn't really that spectacular.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
All the usual suspects right. Y'all know I play Ingress and Pokemon Go all the time. That's no surprise.

37:07.000 --> 37:13.000
Final Fantasy 14 I've kind of been ramping more and more because there's a big patch that comes out on Tuesday.

37:13.000 --> 37:19.000
And like I mentioned a few weeks ago I moved servers which was you know it was a it was a hard change.

37:19.000 --> 37:28.000
But you know I'm trying to take in the whole like OK new people I'm playing with I haven't got to play with before so I can kind of go do new stuff.

37:28.000 --> 37:35.000
So you know kind of been enjoying that type of thing. And yeah still Heroes of the Storm. Quite a bit of that.

37:35.000 --> 37:43.000
I just I try to do my matches every day. I just bought Hanzo today who's more fun to play in Heroes of the Storm than he is in Overwatch in my opinion.

37:43.000 --> 37:49.000
But that's just my opinion. Played a little bit of Overwatch because I wanted to do that cosmetic update that just happened.

37:49.000 --> 37:55.000
And I had to buy Pharah's new skin. Like and I actually had the currency to do it so I was really happy so I got Pharah's new skin.

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
So yay. Alright. So that's really my gaming week. That was really it.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Did you play anything at round one?

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
No. Is that weird?

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
That is weird.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
There was just so many people there that obviously all the music games were like taken over.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
And I didn't really want to play the ticket games or the crane games and I just I don't know I thought about playing theater with them.

38:13.000 --> 38:20.000
But then it's like when I would kind of look over there then it's like oh there's that person I haven't seen in like five years and so I just didn't get around to it.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
I did go to Daiso and I bought a ton of candy so you know I did something while I was at the mall.

38:26.000 --> 38:32.000
And the mall actually had the RuPaul's Drag Race pop vinyls in stock whereas it was all sold out here.

38:32.000 --> 38:38.000
So thank you to DDR Freestyle Takeover for getting me to that mall where these were actually in stock.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
So there's that. Let's see.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
SHG100Matt says I want to get Widowmaker's new skin.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
Fantaz says I'm wondering if it's finally time for me to buy Overwatch yet.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Have made some new friends that play it.

38:54.000 --> 39:02.000
I think Overwatch is a great game and it's you know they're what's really good about it is that Blizzard hasn't just shut it down after a year.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
They're still adding to it. They're still investing in it.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
So you know I think I think there's a lot there.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
Overwatch has those free weekends pretty regularly.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
Like it feels like it's almost once a month or once every other month at this point.

39:15.000 --> 39:21.000
So if you're really not sure wait for one of those free weekends and then you can play with your friends.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
And hopefully you'll have a good experience and then maybe you'll decide to buy the game.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
I feel like it's on sale a lot these days too.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
So you know the price of getting in the door is not as high as it was.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Alright.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
Also Fantaz make sure you know what platform your friends are on though.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
Because I'm sure you're already aware but PC not cross platform with PlayStation 4.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Not cross platform with Xbox One.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
So that's why I have the game on both PC and PlayStation 4.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
Because I have friends that pretty much only play on PlayStation 4.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
And I have friends that pretty much only play on PC.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
Truth be told I don't get on PlayStation 4 a lot and play with my friends.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
I kind of tend to gravitate to PC.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.000
But that's only because when it comes to shooters these days I kind of prefer keyboard and mouse.

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
It's weird when it's Halo I prefer controller but I feel like Halo was made for controller.

40:10.000 --> 40:16.000
And Overwatch was probably made for PC and then kind of like backed into controller if that makes sense.

40:16.000 --> 40:21.000
But I know some people that play Overwatch that swear by controller so you do what works for you.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
It ain't always about me.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
I only play the controller because I never got into the keyboard and mouse.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
It's like the only way I can do it.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
I know and playing controller on PC is probably really dumb.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
I have a laptop. I have no place to put a mouse.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
You're not the only one that does it.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
I know for a fact you're not the only one that's plugged controller in the PC and done it that way.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
I think you're putting yourself at a disadvantage but...

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
I don't play competitively. Well actually I don't play at all right now but you know.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
I wasn't playing competitively to begin with.

40:51.000 --> 40:57.000
But like if you know that you're going to fumble with keyboard and mouse and you're better with controller then is it really a hit or miss?

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Yeah I know because I'm not used to it at all.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
I mean I was trying to think back when I used to play Duke Nukem and stuff.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
I'm like that was all keyboard. There was no mouse.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
It was just straight up just keyboard.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
So I'm like how the fuck did I do that?

41:09.000 --> 41:14.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat at live.vognetwork.com says it's time the car is controller only confirmed.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
No I had keyboard stuff as well.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
A designer has to consider all elements.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
So anyway.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
Alright let's get to some gaming news.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
I will just mention housekeeping. I don't have a lot to say except follow us on Twitter.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Twitter.com slash o-l-r. We're also on Facebook.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
You know what I haven't plugged in a while is the Discord server.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
If you're not on the Discord server you really should check it out.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
It's all free. Many of y'all are using Discord for your other games anyway.

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
Like if you're playing Overwatch online you might just be saying screw it to Blizzard chat and using Discord.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
If you're playing anything Nintendo online you're probably using Discord because Nintendo's app.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Let's be real.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
So join the VOG Network Discord. It's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
And that'll keep you up to date on all the latest and greatest going on around the network.

42:02.000 --> 42:09.000
Including new shows as they come up online from not just us but all the great shows on our network.

42:09.000 --> 42:15.000
As well as some of the shows if they've opted in and if you're a show that wants to opt in let me know.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Have their own chat channels.

42:17.000 --> 42:23.000
We have a channel on there and we have some folks that post stories in there that we sometimes read on the show.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
I know this week we just got a new one for Anime Jam Session now has a chat room.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
And Shaking and Crying, the newest VOG Network show, also has a chat room.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
So that's just growing over at Discord.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
So check that out. Vognetwork.com slash Discord.

42:36.000 --> 42:41.000
Okay, let's get into gaming news. I think it's time. Loki, let's do it.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
So there is a social platform that's shutting down Mitomo.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
It's shutting down May 9th.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
Thankfully we didn't have a Mitomo Club.

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
Well, I do feel bad this is coming up the week the Dark Sakura isn't here.

42:55.000 --> 43:02.000
Because I feel if anybody can appropriately eulogize Mitomo it would be the one of us that's actually still playing it pretty regularly.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
So we'll have to ask her how she's doing about it next week.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
But yeah, Jamie's the big Mitomo player here.

43:07.000 --> 43:13.000
Yeah, so basically May 9th they're going to be shutting down pretty much all the services that it relies on.

43:13.000 --> 43:19.000
So if you try to launch the app after May 9th they'll basically let you know that you're not going to be able to use it.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
It says you'll no longer be able to see your answers or messages in the app.

43:23.000 --> 43:29.000
You can transfer your Mii character to your Nintendo account by linking it to Mitomo.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
And your sidekick Mii characters will be deleted.

43:32.000 --> 43:37.000
But you can keep your sidekick Mii characters by saving them with a QR code or something like that.

43:37.000 --> 43:47.000
And then they say Mitomo themed icons and clothing items used in your Nintendo account or Super Mario Run game will not display after the services ended.

43:47.000 --> 43:54.000
So, um, interesting. I'm surprised, like how long was it out? Was it a couple years or not even?

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
It's probably been about a year and a half.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Year and a half.

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
It feels like, I don't know, maybe somebody in chat knows the exact date, I don't know.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
But I feel like it hasn't been a very long time. Nintendo just recently got into mobile.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
And May 9th is such a weird day to do that on. It's like a Wednesday.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
So is there something else coming out around that time to replace it?

44:10.000 --> 44:16.000
It launched March 17th, 2016. So it'll actually be coming up on two years.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
It'll be coming up on two years by the time they pull the plug.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
Interesting. But it's weird though. I don't know.

44:22.000 --> 44:28.000
So I guess all those Mitomo coins or whatever that you earn in that, you can't redeem on your Nintendo account.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
No more platinum coins. That's dumb.

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
ActDeftInChat says, I still play Mitomo and makes a little face with that.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
It sucks that all the features from Mitomo will not work after May.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
I'm gonna miss taking me photos and dressing up my Mii.

44:42.000 --> 44:52.000
Yeah, I see a lot of people still use, like when I do see Mitomo, it's people using the little Mitomo picture generator with their phone camera to do AR type of pictures.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
I guess for lack of a better way of saying it.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
That's kind of where I see that feature used the most now.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
I wonder if they're coming out with something else to replace it then.

45:02.000 --> 45:11.000
I don't know, Loki. I think this just might be a sign that Nintendo's mobile ventures have not been doing as well as hope.

45:11.000 --> 45:17.000
I didn't play this. Did they have anything like any sort of premium content that you had to purchase in there?

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
All those costumes.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
All the costumes?

45:19.000 --> 45:25.000
Oh yeah. I mean, you could earn some in-game currency like slowly and you got your rewards for logging in.

45:25.000 --> 45:34.000
Remember Mitomo, I don't know if you know, it had like the little pachinko type thing where you could do the drop and then the drops have some of those premium items in them.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
And so you could pay currency to get more of the drops.

45:37.000 --> 45:42.000
But you could also earn, you know, kind of slowly through in-game methods as well as the way most mobile games work.

45:42.000 --> 45:50.000
It's either pay to speed it up or, you know, earn it slowly through answering questions, getting people to like your posts, those types of things.

45:50.000 --> 45:59.000
That's the other thing about Mitomo. It wasn't much of a game as it was like a social experiment. I don't know what else to label it.

45:59.000 --> 46:05.000
The closest thing it really came to was Tomodachi Life, which isn't much of a game either.

46:05.000 --> 46:11.000
In fact, in my opinion, and some will disagree and disagree strongly, but in my opinion, Tomodachi Life is a terrible game.

46:11.000 --> 46:17.000
It's made some great memes online and so forth, but I think it's just a dumb 3DS app.

46:17.000 --> 46:24.000
To me, it seemed like those games were even less involved than the free 3DS games that they have included in the 3DS.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
Like the little RPG and stuff that you get with the coins that you would earn.

46:31.000 --> 46:40.000
So it's, I mean, there's going to be people out there who are really mad that they're basically losing what they spent their premium coins on after only two years, but...

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Yeah, so that's any digital thing.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
Right? That's the tricky thing. That's really any digital thing in this day and age.

46:46.000 --> 46:50.000
Someday, Loki, there isn't going to be Ingress anymore.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
Which probably would be a better thing for my health and the health of some people I know.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
But someday, Loki, there's not going to be a Pokémon GO anymore.

46:58.000 --> 47:04.000
And that's going to be personally upsetting because I've really not spent that much money on Ingress, all things said and done.

47:04.000 --> 47:10.000
I mean, maybe on the physical stuff that ties to Ingress, like the sweatshirt I own and things like that.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
But in the game itself, I've barely spent money.

47:13.000 --> 47:19.000
But in Pokémon GO, I don't want to talk about it. We already talked about it a few weeks ago on the show and I'm not going back there.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
I've spent more than I care to admit again.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
And so inevitably, Pokémon GO will go away.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
I think Pokémon GO is going to last longer than two years.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
You know, it's still doing very well.

47:29.000 --> 47:36.000
But you just have to look at the amount of time that you spent playing the game versus the amount of money that you dropped into it and whether that was worth it or not.

47:36.000 --> 47:45.000
Which it probably was. I mean, you spent hours playing the game and I'm sure that the cost per hour is pretty small.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
And that's kind of what I have to remember. You're right.

47:48.000 --> 47:54.000
Sometimes, Loki, it's not about the Pokémon we caught, but it's about the friends we made along the way.

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
And, you know, I have met new people playing Pokémon GO.

47:58.000 --> 48:03.000
I went out and did a walk around Capitol Park for three hours on Community Day.

48:03.000 --> 48:08.000
And that's probably not something I would have done if Pokémon GO didn't exist.

48:08.000 --> 48:18.000
So, you're right. That's the only way I'm going to be able to kind of cope when these games inevitably shut down is, well, at least I did all this other shit that would have never happened if it wasn't for those games.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
Now, can I say that about Miitomo?

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
No.

48:23.000 --> 48:32.000
Most of the people I talk to on Miitomo, all of the people I talk to on Miitomo, are people that were connected through my Facebook or my Twitter account anyway.

48:32.000 --> 48:39.000
Which, if I want to post status updates and answer questions, those are probably better platforms for me to be using.

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
The only thing Miitomo gave me that those platforms didn't give me was Virtual Barbie and Ken.

48:43.000 --> 48:52.000
And Room Designer, which I know they added to Miitomo later on, and some of the other design features, you know, that don't really exist on those other platforms.

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
So, that's what Facebook needs to get into. Forget this whole game broadcasting thing.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
They need to take PlayStation home and put it on Facebook.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Well, they do have Oculus.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
There you go. VRChat coming soon to Facebook.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Oh God, I already have it.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
No, I know, I know. So, coming soon there.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
Yeah, VRChat is slowly working its way to Second Life.

49:14.000 --> 49:25.000
Speaking of games that are going under, Phantasm Chat, and I don't think this is on the show anywhere else, Phantasm Chat over at live.vognetwork.com also brings up Rest in Peace Paragon.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
Yeah, that was just announced this past week, too, that Paragon is getting shut down.

49:29.000 --> 49:36.000
And I'm just assuming because Fortnite is where the money's at right now, and everybody's, they're just reallocating their resources there.

49:36.000 --> 49:43.000
Like, this is the game that's making waves, and Paragon wasn't, so see you later, Paragon.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
It's kind of sad for the loyalists that were playing that Paragon game.

49:46.000 --> 49:54.000
I checked it out once or twice on PlayStation 4, but I didn't think it was as good as Overwatch.

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
It just wasn't. I'm sorry. I know there's fans of that game. It didn't feel as polished.

49:58.000 --> 50:04.000
The heroes didn't make sense in the same way, but maybe I'm trying to apply Overwatch logic to Paragon, it just didn't really work.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
So, but I do, I have played Fortnite, and I do like, I do like that.

50:08.000 --> 50:16.000
I tried the Battle Royale-esque thing in Fortnite, and that was, that was fun for a little bit, and then I kind of realized I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
So I just need to keep trying, I guess.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
Well, I guess now, if you want to play with Paragon, you just have to play more Diablo 3.

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
Alright. Anyway, let's move on, talking about livestreaming, as we were doing earlier.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
Let's talk about Twitch, and actually, this is a big win for Twitch.

50:31.000 --> 50:38.000
Twitch, back in 2016, took legal action against bot, or I guess, bot sellers?

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
Bot, view bot sellers.

50:41.000 --> 50:49.000
So, basically, if you were, if you were that comment we got earlier, that I'm only getting one viewer, and it's impossible for me to get discovered,

50:49.000 --> 50:56.000
well, you could pay bots to come watch your stream, and help boost you up in the rankings, which I do not endorse, you should not do.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
That's a terrible idea, because that type of shit just always has a way of catching up with you.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
And that's kind of what happened here.

51:03.000 --> 51:09.000
Twitch took some legal action, and some court documents were filed on January 22nd, that is shown.

51:09.000 --> 51:21.000
A California judge ordered bot makers, Michael and Catherine and Jomy, to permanently shut down the software, and pay Twitch 1.3 million dollars.

51:21.000 --> 51:32.000
You know where that number came from? 55,000 for damages, 1.31 million is the profits they made off the business.

51:33.000 --> 51:43.000
Think about that for a minute. So when you hear this judgment for one point, all but 55,000 of that, 55,000, we'll say that was court fees, now the actual damages, right?

51:43.000 --> 51:52.000
That bot made 1.3 million dollars. There's that many people out there, desperate to bump up their view counts.

51:53.000 --> 52:05.000
I'm not trying to make anybody feel bad or anything, but I'm just trying to put myself in their shoes. I just would never pay for that.

52:05.000 --> 52:11.000
Why would you want artificial people watching? Because they're not going to stay around.

52:11.000 --> 52:20.000
Once the time's up, it's almost like you get addicted to it, right? It's virtual drugs. That's what it is, right? Just one hit.

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
I want to see what it feels like to have 100 viewers and go viral. Just one hit. And then when you stop paying, they're all gone.

52:26.000 --> 52:35.000
And if your content wasn't engaging enough to get that stuff organically, then you're not going to keep any of those people that got fooled into subscribing to your stream.

52:35.000 --> 52:44.000
And so you're just going to have to pay again and again and again. Virtual drugs. That's what it is. 1.3 million dollars worth of virtual drugs.

52:45.000 --> 52:53.000
Dungeonbuster in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, views our social currency to some and they want more regardless of the cost.

52:53.000 --> 52:59.000
And AkumaJP in chat says, throwing back to an OLR in-joke, I'll friend your butt for a fee.

52:59.000 --> 53:04.000
That's an in-joke from OLR going back to an old YouTube video.

53:04.000 --> 53:13.000
Kaijuto in chat says, I have no problem with them using bots. I get why Twitch is mad, but it means nothing to me if they used bots or not.

53:13.000 --> 53:23.000
Well, I mean, I suppose at the end of the day, you're right. What they do doesn't really affect me. I mean, their artificial ranking might outrank my organic ranking.

53:23.000 --> 53:30.000
But at the end of the day, does it really matter? Probably not. But the judge did rule in Twitch's favor legally.

53:30.000 --> 53:40.000
Because, you know, the judge is on Twitch's side because it was trademark infringement, unfair competition, a violation of the Anti-Cyber Squatting Consumer Protection Act.

53:40.000 --> 53:51.000
Because they had names like shoptwitch.com, twitchstreams.org, and they would provide streamers with fake viewers for up to $760 a month.

53:51.000 --> 54:00.000
And so Twitch said it made it unfairly easy for streamers to earn money and clear the hurdle into the partner program. Oh, I didn't think of that.

54:00.000 --> 54:10.000
That's why some people were doing this was so that they could artificially hit those milestones to get into the partner program and then dream that they're going to make all this money back now that they're in the program.

54:10.000 --> 54:20.000
Well, it's a good thing that no other streaming platforms out there raise the requirements to get into their partner programs. So I'm sure that won't be a problem anywhere else.

54:20.000 --> 54:35.000
No, it won't. And Twitch said it resulted in a deluge of shoddy content for its viewers, saying, quote, instead of engaging in interesting social interactions on Twitch, they may encounter bots spewing lists of random words.

54:35.000 --> 54:45.000
So, interesting. I thought that was worth noting because I just did not realize how much money was going into that, you know what I mean?

54:45.000 --> 54:55.000
And the fact that Twitch kind of won that. So if you are one of these people that uses these botting services, it's going to come around eventually, so don't get too used to it.

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
And legally, now there's precedent. Anyway, let's move on. Loki.

55:00.000 --> 55:12.000
All right. Let's talk a little bit about Pokemon Go. So they had some new Pokemon make their way out over here. The big one being, I guess, from the Hoenn region.

55:12.000 --> 55:31.000
So they've got, I know I saw the picture of it. Was it Camerupt, Nosepass, Trapinch, Igrond, and they're saying that even Solrock and Lunatone.

55:31.000 --> 55:38.000
Yeah, those are the two that have these weird region rules, it seems like. So there's more regional exclusives. Hooray.

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
Yeah, so all in all, there was like 23 new Pokemon that were added.

55:42.000 --> 55:52.000
I don't know about you guys and your parts of the world, but these 23 new Pokemon are not very prolific for me. I'm not seeing them as often as I see other new stuff when they release.

55:52.000 --> 56:04.000
Like, for example, there's a Zigzagoon on the house right now. I see those all the time from Gen 3, which matches the games. They were the Rattata trashy-mons in that series of games.

56:04.000 --> 56:13.000
But I don't see these new ones very often at all. I think I've caught like an Aron, I've caught the thing that looks like a flower with tentacles or something weird.

56:13.000 --> 56:23.000
But I've hatched a lot because Pokemon also is doing that event right now where all the eggs are hatching Gen 3 Pokemon. I don't remember how long that's going, I think it was about a week.

56:24.000 --> 56:33.000
But all the eggs you collect now are going to hatch Gen 3 Pokemon. Keep in mind, if you have eggs in your inventory that you've been sitting on for a while, they can still hatch anything.

56:33.000 --> 56:39.000
They might hatch Gen 3, but they're probably going to hatch Gen 1 or Gen 2 because what is in the egg is determined when you get the egg.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
So any egg you collect now is going to have Gen 3 Pokemon in it.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Yeah, I need to hatch my eggs.

56:45.000 --> 56:54.000
It's really good because I've been waiting to get a Wonder Treecko so I can evolve that because I have like 70 Treecko candies so I was ready to evolve it to the next step.

56:54.000 --> 57:02.000
But I was waiting to get a Wonder, for those who don't know what that is, it's basically like a high appraised one that has good attack, defense, HP.

57:02.000 --> 57:08.000
So I was waiting until I got a Wonder Treecko to evolve it on down the line. It took me forever to get a Torchic that way too.

57:08.000 --> 57:16.000
But when you hatch Pokemon, I think they're guaranteed to at least be like, what is it, 70% IV? 80% IV? I think?

57:16.000 --> 57:24.000
So it's always going to be one of the top two appraisals. You're not going to get like, oh, this Pokemon is very unfortunate. So you're not going to get that.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Oh, this Pokemon, you should just put it down.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Yeah, take this Pokemon out.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
It's not even worth the meat it's made up of.

57:32.000 --> 57:47.000
Let's see, Act Def says, I do see Numels and Wishmer though. There was a Numel nest for a day here in SAC because the nest rotated the day they launched Gen 3, these new ones, and then they rotated again the very next day during their regular rotation.

57:47.000 --> 57:57.000
So Capitol Park downtown was a Numel nest for a day. Meowth. Womp, womp. Yeah, right? Been there, done that.

57:57.000 --> 58:08.000
I mean, that was a Wailmer nest just a couple weeks ago. That was the motherlode because I actually got a Wailmer nest and I got a Wailord just because that was a nest and that's where we went on community day.

58:08.000 --> 58:16.000
So it was like Pikachu, Wailmer, Pikachu, Wailmer. Pikachu, Wailmer was, you know, awesome. But yeah, now it's Meowth. So we're hoping it'll turn into something better in a couple weeks.

58:17.000 --> 58:28.000
But also pointing out Wishmer is pretty common. Yeah, I would say Wishmer is the one I've been seeing the most. But Wishmer is also one of the rare Pokemon that only takes 12 candy to evolve.

58:28.000 --> 58:35.000
So that's good that that's plentiful because it's something new for the evolving game than just Pidgey. So that's good.

58:35.000 --> 58:40.000
Can we just get rid of the Pidgeys? That would be nice.

58:41.000 --> 58:46.000
I like catching Pidgeys because I go, yay, this is more XP from evolving.

58:46.000 --> 58:54.000
Okay. And then, of course, has been the main complaint with Pokemon Go. Lots of hacking.

58:54.000 --> 59:00.000
So I guess these new Pokemon Go EX raids have been a prime target of hacking.

59:00.000 --> 59:08.000
So I guess EX raids because I haven't actually done these yet. So they're an invitation only game event.

59:08.000 --> 59:17.000
Neither have I. With as much as I play Pokemon Go, I have yet to get invited to one of these raids because they only ever put out the passes for the stupid sponsored stops.

59:17.000 --> 59:24.000
And we don't have a Sprint store in this neighborhood or a Starbucks that is a sponsored stop. Excuse me, a gym. Sorry.

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
They're sponsored stops. We don't have gyms. Like none of the Starbucks here are gyms.

59:28.000 --> 59:35.000
The closest Starbucks gym. And I'm not giving away where I live because this is far away.

59:35.000 --> 59:39.000
How about Arden is the closest Starbucks gym? That's a ways away from here.

59:39.000 --> 59:43.000
Oh, I've got one right by my house. The Safeway by my house.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
You're going to give away where you live.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
Oh, yes. By the Safeway. Which Safeway?

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Alright, alright. You do what you want.

59:50.000 --> 59:58.000
So there's a Safeway by my house that's a Starbucks gym. And then in that same shopping center they actually have a Sprint store that's also another sponsor.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I don't know if it's a gym. I think it might be a gym. I don't remember.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:09.000
I actually know exactly where that is. But anyway, I do want to quickly say before because people are already starting to correct me in chat.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I do understand that parks are supposed to be rewarding this as well. Okay, I have a park right by my house I raid infrequently.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
There's another park down the street I go to all the time I raid at frequently.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:28.000
There's plenty of parks I've been raiding at and all the EX passes still seem to be going to Starbucks and Sprint.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I have yet, I mean, I think some of the parks in like East Sacramento, downtown, kind of like 30, I think McKinley Park I heard got a raid.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
But it's rare. It's not, they need to rotate where that shit is happening better.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Like I get why they have sponsored stops, but just, you know, enough. Jesus.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000
So basically what happened was is there was an account of one person that did receive one of these invitations.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:05.000
It's basically a 20 man raid at a certain location. And so the person gets there to go, you know, catch I guess Mewtwo or something like that.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And the app said that there was 40 people standing right next to them when there was no one standing next to them.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
It's just, you know, people spoofing their location.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And that's why they need to mix it up because they need to throw these spoofers off their game.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Because spoofers are regularly raiding those stupid Sprint and Starbucks gyms so that they can get these EX passes so that the rest of us can't get them.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:39.000
So that's the number one thing that Niantic needs to change and they can do it now is cycle out where you're giving out the EX passes.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Like, okay, cool. Yes. Again, I understand those sponsored places give you money, but consider like shaking it up a little more and throw these spoofers off their game because they have you figured out.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Yeah. And basically, you know, the lobbies in those matches are completely full of spoofers.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.000
So and, you know, they're saying that, of course, another thing that you see is a lot of gyms constantly filled with fake accounts.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000
It's only, you know, honestly, in my opinion, it's only going to get worse when you can actually trade Pokémon. Can you imagine that? Because now you can have just accounts that are disposable.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I think that's why they've been dragging their fucking feet on that rollout.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Yeah.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:28.000
ActDeftInChat says at live.vognetwork.com, you kind of have to manipulate gyms and stuff. We don't have sponsored gyms in Mexico at all, and people manage to get those EX rates.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Well, I would imagine because you don't have the sponsored stuff, your parks are becoming those locations. Am I wrong? Like, they're coming up with some type of alternate location.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000
And if I'm right in that, that's actually probably better than what we have, at least where I live.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:53.000
You know, okay, yes, there are Sprint and Starbucks stuff, but it's on the other side of town. And I'm lazy. And rush hour.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:00.000
And the rates end by like 7.30, 8 o'clock. So if I don't go there during rush hour, I'm screwed.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Anyway. Let's see. FantasmChat says, I love New York City. When I was there at any Starbucks nearby, they were so busy, the Wi-Fi was so slow.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:18.000
So, I mean, was it all Pokémon players trying to get on the local gym? I don't know. Alright. Anyway.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Let's talk about a game that a lot of people are looking forward to, and that is the Avengers project that's coming.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Oh yeah, I forgot all about that.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Yeah, right? Remember they announced it at E3.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I was excited. I'm still excited, but I need to see what it is.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Well, this might make you more excited, actually. You may or may not have heard that Sean S. Gagge, I hope I said that right,

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:47.000
he was with Naughty Dog and worked on Uncharted and The Last of Us. He joined this team at the beginning of the year.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And then just this past week, Stephen Berry from EA Visceral, who worked on Dead Space,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:59.000
and some other staff who've collectively worked on Batman Arkham Origins and Star Wars Battlefront.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
And Crystal Dynamics in a statement about, you know, boasting all this new talent says,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:11.000
their AAA experience adds to an already deep roster, making us well positioned to deliver on the ambitious goals we've set for ourselves with the Avengers project.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:19.000
It's a stellar addition of many people who fit incredibly well into our wheelhouse of building game experiences we all love.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:26.000
This Marvel game is shaping up to be something pretty big, and I imagine this is going to be talk of the town at E3 this year.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
This is probably going to be one of the biggest titles at E3 this year.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I hope so. I'm a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
There is a new Avengers movie this year, right?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
There is one in May.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
So, there you go.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:44.000
The big infinity wars where it's like fucking everything. Just throw the sink kitchen in there.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:51.000
So, maybe the game won't be out by May, because I would think that they would have had to start the ball rolling on that by now.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Well, they still have stuff after this movie.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Oh, sure. Well, yeah. There's a second part to Infinity War. I'm well aware of that.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:05.000
And there's always timingness with the Blu-ray release, so, you know, it doesn't have to come out date and day with the movie.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:13.000
So, yeah. It's shaping up to be big. I'm excited to see E3. I think that's going to be the big, big game this year. We'll see.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:20.000
And, um, isn't there... Didn't we hear rumblings of a third Tomb Raider game? There were rumors and stuff.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Or did they pass it off to another studio? Or what was the deal with that?

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Maybe. I mean, I know there's a Tomb Raider movie that's coming out. Isn't that this year? That should be this year.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
I think that's this year too, yeah.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Maybe we'll see an announcement around E3?

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Meh.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
That'll be another big thing to reveal at E3. We'll see.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Alright, just another story here before we get to the classic game of the week, which sadly, Jamie's not here to do it this week.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
But I stole it in her place, as I tend to do. Loki.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Alright. So, let's talk a little bit about Xbox Game Pass, in case you forgot what that was.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:01.000
It's a service that you can pay money to each month, and you basically get access to over a hundred different games.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Kind of think of it a little bit like that PlayStation Now, where you can stream stuff, except this also has Xbox.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I mean, I guess PlayStation Now also has, like, PlayStation 4 games as well.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I don't know. I don't subscribe to it because I think it's a terrible service, but...

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Now, the Xbox will do it.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Well, but they want you to subscribe to it.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Well, you know what? I might be more open to subscribing to it if they fucking added backwards compatibility.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Whereas Microsoft is actually doing that quite often, and adding new games every month.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
So, you know what? I would give them more of the benefit of the streaming service than I would...

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
To be fair, isn't a big, big chunk of the collection PlayStation 3 games, though?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I mean, that's backwards compatible. You want it to go all the way back to PS2 and PS4?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I want it to be able to pop a disc into my system and just play it if I want to, is what I want.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Is that so much to ask?

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Apparently. Well, let's come back to this topic later in the show. Yes and no.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000
So anyways, so now they're saying that with this service, before it was, you know, pretty much Xbox 360 games and stuff like that.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Now they're saying that they're going to even add new exclusive Xbox games that are going to be coming out day and date with their releases.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:26.000
So for example, Crackdown 3, they show Sea of Thieves and State of Decay 2 as some titles that will be available on the service the same time that they're released.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.000
So that's pretty awesome. So basically, I guess it looks like, yeah, six month subscription to the service is about 60 bucks.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Ten bucks a month isn't bad, especially if you're into renting games and stuff.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So yeah, that's pretty awesome. I mean, if I had an Xbox One and I was into just playing kind of a little bit of everything, that might not be a bad option.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000
But I'm just going to get Crackdown 3 when it comes out on PC.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Microsoft's really trying to push to, especially, I mean, Sony's vulnerable right now with their PlayStation Network kind of flopping a lot this past week too.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Microsoft's going to try to seize the moment. They have to.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:13.000
If I had to go back and pick, I got a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, I probably might have gone with Xbox One.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I like PlayStation VR, so that's a thing. But honestly, they've had better mod support in their games.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:27.000
They've had, as far as the games coming out multi-platform and stuff, it seems like that they have more features or play better on the Xbox One.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I have to give Microsoft kudos. I love the way they've handled backwards compatibility. I really do.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:41.000
It's not perfect because the game rollout has been slower, but it's really, really better than what's going on at Sony right now.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Well, just like getting into it later, but if it's that easy, clearly you're trying to monetize it. You're trying to make money off of it.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
So it's like, come on. This is ridiculous.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Kaijuto in chat says, PSN isn't flopping. You live in some kind of Trump Earth too. Okay, hold on, because I am not fucking standing for that comparison, first of all.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:11.000
So I am live going right now to Google News, which hopefully is truthy enough for you.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And I'm going to Google PlayStation Network. Oh, here we go. Top result, nine hours ago. PlayStation Network is having issues again.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
It has been down recently quite a bit from what I hear.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:32.000
So let's see. What else do we have here? Some other headlines here. PlayStation Network hit with server issues for several days.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:40.000
PlayStation Network update for PlayStation 4 users playing Fortnite and Overwatch. PSN status down. So on and so on.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
So you can miss me with that comment. Thank you very much.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:53.000
All right. Anyhow, let's go back. Let's go back to when times were a little simpler. We didn't even have to worry about online stuff.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000
We didn't have to worry about online games. You know why? Because you had to go to an arcade to play them.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
And those arcade games weren't online either.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
That's right. They were never down.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Well, let's not go that far.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
That's true. Sometimes they were there.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:17.000
It's the classic game of the week where we're going to step into the gaming vault and pick out a game that we think, hey, this deserves a little bit of your respect this week.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:26.000
And for what it's worth, this is something you can play on Sony PlayStation and download it from the store. It's in the Arcade Archives.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.000
And you can check out a classic game called Bomb Jack. That's what I picked for the classic game this week.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
A little bit of the noise there for the arcade version of Bomb Jack.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Bomb Jack was released in 1984.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
It was released by a company called Tekan, not to be confused with Tekan.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
But they actually changed the name of this company a little later on to be Tecmo.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
So you probably heard of Tecmo.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:01.000
And this ended up in one of the Tecmo collections, I think, that showed up on Xbox and stuff later on.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
So anyway, what is Bomb Jack?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.000
In this game, you're kind of like, I would say like a floaty Pac-Man is the best way to describe Bomb Jack.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
It's like Pac-Man with gravity.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
But it's like you kind of float.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
You're like the princess from Super Mario Brothers 2.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
No, more like Luigi in the way that he slowly kind of jumps and can kind of hang at the top.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
That's what Bomb Jack does.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
He does high jumps. He floats in the air.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
And what you've got to do in this game, you collect the red bombs on the screen.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
And you've got to avoid the birds and the mummies.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I don't know why birds and mummies are the enemies, but there you go.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
And they can morph into things like flying saucers.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
And if you touch them, you die.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:45.000
But, if you get a power coin, as the player there did, because you heard the little wah-wah noise,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
you can actually destroy these things.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
It's very similar to when you eat a power...

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
The Pac-Man.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
So what's up with the pyramids and stuff in the background there?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
That's just the aesthetic of the background, yeah.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:03.000
If you collect the bombs in a certain order, you will fill up the meter faster and get that P a little faster.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.000
You can also get a bonus coin, an extra life coin, and a special coin, which gives you a free game.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
So as you can imagine, that one is not very common.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
It was ported everywhere to a variety of different systems.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And that's actually where I know this game from, because of course, my childhood, Commodore 64.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
There was a version of this on the Commodore 64.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Now here's the thing I want to talk about with Commodore 64 for a minute.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
So you hear the music in this game, right?

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
It's all like cutesy, right?

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
And see, this level doesn't have the ancient Egypt.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
It's got like an old castle-type aesthetic.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
So they kind of change.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Well, here's the thing.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.000
The music on the Commodore 64 was completely different, and it was awesome.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Here's the music from the Commodore 64 version of the game.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
You got it.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Oh man, that sweet sounds of the Commodore 64.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
It's just amazing.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
So yeah, I like that song a lot better.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Which, by the way, this song was an actual song from the 80s that somebody made, I guess, to be in Bomb Jack.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
It was kind of like a licensed song for the Commodore 64.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
But the song is a little bit obscure, unless you really follow electronic music.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I know this guy is really big in his industry.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
His name, and I hope I'm pronouncing it correctly.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
His name is Jean-Michel Jarre, I think is how you pronounce his name.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000
It was a song called Magnetic Fields Part 2, and here's that song.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Right? It's the same song.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
But this song is from 1984, and it fucking sounds like it, right?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
There's no lyrics or anything. It's that kind of song.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Anyway, I don't want to play too much of that song because I don't want to get sued.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:08.000
So we'll go back to the sweet Commodore 64 version of that song while I talk about some of the other ports of the game.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000
For example, in 1985 it was on the Sega SG-1000.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
86 saw a release on the Spectrum, the ZX Spectrum.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
It was also on Amstrad.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000
It was on the Atari ST, the Amiga, the Game Boy in 1992.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And then it kind of started showing up in retro collections.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
It was on the MSX. That was an unofficial homebrew.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
PlayStation 2 had Tecmo Hit Paradise.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Xbox had Tecmo Classic Arcade.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
It was on the Wii Virtual Console.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:42.000
In 2007 the NES version of the game was, and the arcade version came out when the Wii Virtual Console started doing arcades.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
It's on the 3DS Virtual Console, the NES version anyway.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And all the way up to 2014 when the PlayStation 4 port came out.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And then Wii U Virtual Console as well.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Lastly, in 2017 finally the iPhone got a version of this as well.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.000
So yeah, it's a classic game that's come back a lot in some of these retro collections.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Some people may know this from Mighty Bomb Jack.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000
That was an NES game and an arcade game that came out in 86.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.000
I do want to stress that game was similar in how the bomb guy kind of flew around and collected bombs.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Or people thought they were cherries, the NES version, because they kind of didn't look like bombs.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
But it was more of a side-scroller in Mighty Bomb Jack.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
It wasn't that way in the original Bomb Jack.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
The original Bomb Jack had the static screens.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
And the reason why I picked Bomb Jack over Mighty Bomb Jack is that

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
A. I kind of think it was a better game.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:41.000
B. The sweet, sweet music from my Commodore 64.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
There you go.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Bomb Jack, your classic game of the week.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Did you ever play that, Loki, on any of those millions of...

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I don't remember that, no.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Fantaz in chat says, this song sounds ahead of its time.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Dude, seriously, Commodore 64 stuff, like a lot of it was.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Just go to YouTube and just Google, like, best Commodore 64 soundtrack

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000
And you'll get a whole bunch of Commodore 64 game stuff that was just amazing.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
In fact, ooh, I should play something during the break tonight.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Let's see, also, Tiger Claw in chat says,

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
It's interesting how much video game music has influenced electronic dance music these days.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
That is an interesting observation, now it's come full circle.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
You know, the electronic dance music probably influenced the early video game music.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
And still does, I'm sure.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
But now it's going the other way as well, you're absolutely right.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000
It's that video game music, like you hear video games sometimes get sampled

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
In, you know, pop and electronic stuff, which is pretty cool.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Yeah, Fantaz in chat says,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
I was watching a DJ called Zed, he's a pretty well-known guy,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Drop Zelda, and everyone was cheering.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Some guy, I don't remember the guy's name,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Maybe one of you guys that follows electronic music better than I do knows,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Some guy played Look to the Sky from DDR during his set.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I remember that came up on the show about a year ago or so,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
And everybody was, woo, because, you know, like a DDR song is pretty cool.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
So, anyway.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
That's going to do it for this segment of Orange Lawns Radio,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
But we'll be back after a quick break, we've got plenty more Orange Lawns Radio to come,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Including a store where you buy video games from,

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Might not be there in a couple months, we'll talk a little bit about that.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
And we'll talk about an interesting new patent from Sony,

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And more when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lawns Radio.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lawns Radio Live Tonight,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:36.000
This is episode number 716 of our show in progress here for January the 28th of 2018.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
You missed some DDR talk at the top of the show if you're just joining us live.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Loki got a DDR machine, if you can believe it.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.000
And I went to a fun tournament yesterday, which we had talked about last week on the show,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
That felt like going to a high school reunion, but like the one I wanted to go to.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
So, anyway.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
We're going to get back into some more news that we have yet to cover,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
And we'll start off with some rapid fire news. Loki.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Yes, so unfortunately, and this is kind of not the whole shocking being that they've,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
You know, had talked about bankruptcy not too long ago,

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000
But court documents have been filed regarding Toys R Us,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000
And as part of their chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization plan,

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:22.000
They're going to be closing 182 Toys R Us locations across 40 states.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Now however, this is Toys R Us and Babies R Us as well,

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000
So they are including the Babies R Us locations as well,

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And thankfully, at least in this neck of the woods,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
It's only a Babies R Us, so whatevs.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Your babies are grown up, you don't care.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Yeah, we went there before, but whatever.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Like most of the Toys R Us nowadays, they have like a section that is Babies R Us.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Yeah, Toys R Us, like every Toys R Us I've been to, like the whole back corner is like the baby section.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000
So it's, I mean, it's disappointing to see all this stuff closing, but...

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Now somebody asked me on Twitter, just so you know,

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Because we've talked about it on the show,

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
When Shane was here, we talked about our adventure to the Toys R Us that's two hours away,

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
That still has the paper slips to get video games, remember that?

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
And somebody asked me on Twitter, is that on the list? Did that one close?

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
No, it is still going to be open,

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
And hopefully still going to make it take paper slips up to the front to get the games that you need.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Yeah, like, ironically, I go to Toys R Us quite often,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Because it's just, it's nearby and the kids like looking at stuff,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.000
So it's still very, you know, it's always busy when I go in there.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
It's never like, you know, not busy.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I mean, I'm sure that they've been impacted a bit by, you know, other retailers and stuff,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.000
But, you know, honestly, think about it, like how many big toy stores are there?

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
I mean, there's department stores, so you have like toy stores and stuff in like, you know,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Targets and Walmarts and stuff like that, but there's not really any big toy stores anymore.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
They're the only ones.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:58.000
But I do think the Target and the Walmart toy sections are what's doing them in more than like Amazon.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I really do. I think it's those.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000
And to some extent, I mean, I know this is very minor,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
But there's a lot of toys and board games and stuff you can get at like Walgreens,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
And drugstores almost always have a toy aisle, right?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I guess those are like kind of discounted close out stuff.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
I guess that's true. I think it's probably more the Targets and the Walmarts than anything.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
And it's also people buying smarter because nowadays, like if you're looking for something,

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
You know, like I do a lot of Lego stuff.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I look at there's like whole subreddits and stuff to like deals that are going on.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
So it's easy to find.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Okay, I want to get this set.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Who has it on sale, you know, right now?

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Oh, Walmart has it on sale, so I'm gonna go get it over there.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Or there's ways to check inventory and stuff.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:47.000
But Toys R Us, you know, they do have a lot of stuff that you might not necessarily find at those locations.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Like, you know, they have a larger variety of toys that are available.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Whereas those, you know, Targets and Walmarts don't carry everything.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
In chat at live.vognetwork.com, Rockat says,

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I love going to Toys R Us all the time.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Yeah, you know, the whole way that two hour away from here Toys R Us story came up is because,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
You know, Shane, as one of the hosts of Ranger Pride, which I know has been on hiatus for a little bit,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
But hopefully it's coming back soon.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
He loves to collect the Power Ranger toys.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
And so you'd have to go to like all the Toys R Us areas.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
So sometimes I would join him because I'd be like,

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Oh, well, I could play Ingress or Pokemon and, you know, go to some new places.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Or, heck, in the case of driving all the way up to Chico to go to Toys R Us,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I'm gonna go to Hula's Mongolian Barbecue, which is like the most amazing Mongolian Barbecue,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
But it's all the way up there.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
So I find a reason to tag along, right?

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
So, you know, that would be-

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Oh man, I haven't had Mongolian Barbecue in a long time.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
That sounds really good.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Yeah, so, uh, yeah, so it was kind of like, the toys are, the toy part's cool, but I'm tagging along for the food.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
And the uniques.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000
God, I remember like, it's like, I remember being a kid and just like,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Oh yeah, we're gonna go to Toys R Us.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
And it's like, such the event.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Oh yeah.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Oh shit, you know, like-

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Well, and Rock Hat again in chat is referencing,

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I remember seeing the world of Nintendo back in my early years.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Well, they used to do all that, remember like,

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Wasn't it like Nickelodeon did a sweepstakes back in the day?

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Where it was like, you would have like,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
What was it like the-

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
What do they call that shit?

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Like the shop to you drop?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I don't know, but it was something like, you had like two minutes in a Toys R Us, or maybe it was KB.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
No, it was Toys R Us.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Was it Toys R Us?

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Yeah, Toys R Us.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
And it was like, just fill that card.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
It was like you were on Supermarket Sweep, but a toy store.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Yeah, they-

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
And it was like the contest everybody wanted to win.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Yeah, they were, and there is funny that you mention that, because also Reddit,

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:37.000
There was an AMA that happened a while back, where they had an AMA for someone that was a winner of that contest,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
And like, about what happened, and how that went down.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
God bless Reddit getting the stuff that people really want to know.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
It's awesome, but like, they talked about it like, I guess like beforehand, like obviously they filmed everything,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000
But beforehand, like, they would walk them around the store, like to show them where stuff was,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Like, and they wouldn't have to necessarily get big things, like they could just kind of tag that they wanted to get that,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Because obviously they're not going to be able to load stuff in their cart.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
But like, yeah, it was great.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
They can't throw hams in the shopping cart, like they do on Supermarket Sweep.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Which, by the way, is still like in the top three of like all-time best games.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
That's like one of my guilty pleasure shows.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
That's one of the, which is, okay, okay.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I know this is rapid fire news, but the show is running shorter tonight, so guess what?

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Coming up to the straight station, choo choo, tangent train, choo choo.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Okay, here we go.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000
One of my favorite things to watch on Twitch lately.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
I am obsessed.com, I don't think I've talked about this on the show.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
I am obsessed.com with Buzzer on Twitch.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
What? What's that?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
It's B-U-Z-Z-R.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
And all they do, all day long, on Twitch, apparently they are also a digital channel.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Because you know how like when all the TV stations went from like analog to digital?

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Like, all these new networks showed up.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
But it's bullshit nobody watches.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Like, except maybe like, okay, maybe you have like a grandma that watches the digital network that shows reruns from the 50s and 60s of obscure TV shows.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Like all the time. Because this is stuff grandma remembers, right?

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Those types of things.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Well, one of these digital expansions is a network called Buzzer that shows old game shows.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
It's owned by Fermantle Media who did a lot of those old game shows.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000
So, they have a selection, it's most of those that they actually play on Twitch.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Now, the only read I'm going to give Twitch is that it's very obvious they run the same five hour block over and over for a few days and then switch it out.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.000
But it is still very nice to be able to come home from work, plop on the couch, fire up the Xbox 360,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000
and watch on Buzzer old episodes of the match game with Brett Summers and Charles Nelson Reilly.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Although lately all the episodes they've been showing have had the guy that was Radar and Mash instead of Charles Nelson Reilly because he was, you know, he was filming a movie or something.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
So, he was gone for a little while.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
But anyway, my point is, I fucking love watching old game shows right now.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And my understanding is Buzzer over the air just got Supermarket Sweep.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
And that's like got to be my top three like of all time game shows.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:03.000
It's just, it was one of those shows like, you know, where you would be homesick from school or something.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I think it was more of like from school and it's like the shit that you would watch on TV that you would never normally see because-

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Today is Price is Right day.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000
It's like Price is Right, it's just like all this like, you know, what was it?

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:21.000
The People's Court, you know, Supermarket Sweep, all the game shows.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000
You know, someday when I'm inevitably gone and away from this earth, I want people to remember this.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:32.000
One of the best highlights of my life, my entire fucking life, was the day I got to go see The Price is Right done live.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:38.000
No, sadly they didn't call me down on stage. I guess I just wasn't, you know, I was nervous or something.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
But we did get to see, we saw two episodes of The Price is Right because it was a Monday.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
And we saw one and they were like, we need to fill up our audience for the second one, who wants to stay?

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000
We do!

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:56.000
But for the first episode, which was hosted by Bob Barker, I got to sit, which all in itself, I got to see Bob Barker host a game show.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000
I mean, check that off the bucket list, right?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000
But I also got to sit right behind Rod Roddy, rest in peace, right?

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
The infamous announcer of The Price is Right for many, many, many years.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I got to sit right behind him in that jacket, because you know he dressed like Liberace.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
He never wore anything, he always wore a say something outfit.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
And that jacket was sparkling in my face, it was legit.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:25.000
So, I just want everybody to remember, like, what were like the greatest memories of Rob's life the day I got to go see The Price is Right.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Two episodes.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Anyway, I love an excuse to talk about old game shows here on Orange Launch Radio.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
It's a secret, not so secret advice of mine.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Speaking of which, when the hell is, you know, when are we getting Starrcade back again?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Wasn't that supposed to be something?

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
That was supposed to be a thing.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
What was that coming back?

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
I haven't heard. I haven't heard.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Come on, Noel Gus in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, buzzer, I hardly knew her.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
That's B-U-Z-Z-R, there's no E in it. That's the way they do the network.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:07.000
So this is a thing that I never thought I would have to read before, but apparently, someone got the idea that, hey, let's make a Duke Nukem movie.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Which, I'm for that, because Duke Nukem is trash, and it's going to be a trash movie, so I'm down with it.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
So who do they decide that they're thinking about casting?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000
You know what, if they can do Battleship, let them fucking do Duke Nukem. I don't give a fuck anymore.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:29.000
The Clue reboot, nothing's going to damage me anymore. Fuck up all the old video games, I don't give a shit.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Honestly, you can't fuck up the series any more than Duke Nukem Forever did, so they've already hit rock bottom.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
It only goes up from here.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
It only goes up from here.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Do you think she's going to jump?

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Duke Nukem Forever releases.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I'm referencing a new movie.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:51.000
So they have John Cena as Duke Nukem. I can't see it, but I don't care, because who gives a shit?

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
And who, who would be producing this?

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000
But of course, Michael Bay's production company, Platinum Dudes.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
So Michael Bay movie, starring John Cena with Duke Nukem.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I'm there, butt in seat, yes.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.000
There's Extra, and then there's Straight Bro Guy Extra.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:20.000
And this is Straight Bro Guy Extra, which in some ways is more extra than the premiere of RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars 3.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:26.000
There's no plot. It's Guy shouting out one-liners, saving strippers and killing aliens.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Who cares? It's going to be fucking awesome.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I'm sorry, I'm just laughing at the whole concept of this. This is extra for straight men. This is exactly what it is.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
John Cena in a Duke Nukem movie produced by Michael Bay.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Like, did somebody, somebody made this up? This has to be made up. This can't be real.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.000
You can't get more American than that.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:02.000
ActDeftInChat says, you do know John Cena is family-friendly, right? Well, so was Elizabeth Berkley when she was on Saved by the Bell.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Yeah, you know what, and that's cool that John Cena is family-friendly.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:17.000
I'm willing, you know, as much as I hate him, I'm willing to even have Mark Wahlberg reprising.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000
No!

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Or something like that.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Everything.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:27.000
He was all right in pain and gain. I mean, so he can buff up, you know, to like Duke Nukem.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000
In the happening, he ran away from wind.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Okay, to be fair, yes, Mark Wahlberg is terrible. Mark Wahlberg didn't write, direct that movie. He was just, he was just a participant.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:47.000
And the new M. Night Shyamalan is better than old M. Night Shyamalan nowadays, so I don't know.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I mean, granted, he has like, you know, he has the block out, blocked out face for that.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:58.000
But yeah, I would be, it would be better if they could get someone that would do more of a...

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Orel, what's his name? Was it John St. John? What's the guy's name? The guy that does actual Duke Nukem's voice?

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Oh, yeah, I think it's like John St. John or something like that, yeah.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Yeah, and get him to do it.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Sadly, they never pick the actual voice actors.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.000
It's like when they do a Mario movie inevitably, which, you know, seems like more and more is gonna happen, like an animated Mario movie.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000
They're not gonna get Charles Martinet to do the voice, which is unfortunate. He might get to do a cameo somewhere.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Like, he might play, like, Mario's dad or something, but he's not gonna be Mario's voice.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000
They're gonna get fucking Ryan Reynolds or something along those lines.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
It's gonna be fucking weird, Danny DeVito.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
I'm just saying.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.000
If we can't get him to be Detective Pikachu, then we might as well get Danny DeVito to be Mario.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Mario or something, like, I don't care.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Oh, my God, Danny DeVito is Wario. Fanfic, sign me up. Make it happen.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
You can play anybody. I don't care. Just cast him as somebody. Princess Peach, I don't care. That's fine.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000
It's just anybody. I'd just get him in.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:01.000
No, I think Danny DeVito is Wario makes a lot of sense. It really does. Oh, my God.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Anyway, uh, hey, remember when we talked about, like, actual video game news on this program?

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Let's talk about a new trailer for Soul Calibur VI that was released this week.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Speaking of a series that I hope is on the ups, coming up with this new game, Soul Calibur VI revealed some new characters.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Returning characters Nightmare, Shang-Wa, and Killik will be confirmed for Soul Calibur VI.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.000
No big surprise there because all those characters were pretty well received in the early Soul Calibur games.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:36.000
There's also a new person, Groh is the name, or Groh? G-R-O-H. How would you say that?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I'd say Groh, but that is Groh, maybe?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
It sounds like Groh.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Yeah, maybe you have to say it with an edge or something like that. But anyway, Groh looks like he wears the power glove on his arm.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Groh is basically kind of like Doomfist with a sword and more armor. So, there you go.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Also of note, we have more talent news. This one's about Square Enix.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:09.000
A pretty big name going over to Square Enix. Yuji Naka has joined Square Enix. He has mentioned that on his Twitter.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:16.000
He said, just a quick note to let you know, I joined Square Enix in January. I'm joining game development as before and strive to develop games at Square Enix.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I aim to develop an enjoyable game. Please look forward to it.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:26.000
And if the name Yuji Naka does not sound familiar, it should because he made Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:35.000
He was one of three people who made Sonic the Hedgehog. So, who knows? Maybe they're releasing a Final Fantasy spin-off where the bros drive a car and it's got to go fast.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:41.000
No, I have no idea. Or hopefully just doing something new over Square Enix. That would be exciting too, a new IP.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
So, he found the way to Square Enix?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:55.000
He did. He sure did. By the way, it should be pointed out, Yuji Naka, he's known for Sonic, but he did work as a programmer on Alex Kidd in Miracle World and Fantasy Star.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:03.000
He was a lead on Sonic the Hedgehog until his departure in 2006. So, maybe that's the reason.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
So, Karen, what do you do when you're not...

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Whoa, hello.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Talking.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Fucking autoplay.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Ghosts.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:17.000
On the article I'm referencing. Rude. Alright, let's travel around the world and check out what's in stores this week. Loki.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Oh, there's a few things. So, actually this week we've got Dissida Final Fantasy NT coming to Playstation 4.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I didn't understand the demo at all.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Bad demo? Well, I guess Bobby's not picking on that.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I don't want to say it was like Ni No Kuni bad demo, but it was just like one of those, I didn't get it. I misunderstood the assignment.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I didn't get the first Dissida, so...

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Bobby Black Wolf, did you play the Dissida demo?

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I'll play it.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:52.000
See, I don't think he did. Because if he did, I'd be hearing all about it on a show about how, what a terrible game it is. He wouldn't be talking about Ni No Kuni anymore.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Oh, he says he did play it. Wow.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:02.000
He says it wasn't as bad as Ni No Kuni, but I couldn't get the gameplay. Alright, so he's in the same camp I am on that.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.000
It's like they overcomplicated it. Just make Ergits again. Just, you know, with Final Fantasy characters.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I was just hoping it was just going to be like a beat-em-up fighter game. Like, which, another reason why I'm sad Jamie's not here tonight.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:19.000
I know Dragon Ball, I bet she skipped this show to go play Dragon Ball Fighter fighters more. That's probably what it really is.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
But, you know, why not just give me that with Final Fantasy characters? Like, seriously.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Yeah, well, I don't know.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000
There's a game called Sky Force Reloaded on the Nintendo Switch.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.000
EA Sports UFC 3 on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Gundamoniums on Playstation 4 and Vita. Does that have anything to do with Gundam? It kind of sounds like it does.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:56.000
It's a bullet hell shooter. I have no idea what it's supposed to be, but apparently you can upload your stuff to YouTube, so that's kind of cool.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:05.000
And then, let's see. Finally, We Were Here Too for PC. That's it.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Alright, would you mind pulling up the UK stuff while I do it?

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I already did.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Awesome, okay. I'm going to do Japan here real quick. Japan on the Playstation 4 on February 1st gets their release of Dragon Ball Fighters or FighterZ.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:26.000
I'm not sure which one you're supposed to say what it is, but I like FighterZ better, but that's coming out in Japan on February 1st.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Just came out here a couple days ago.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And that game Gundamoniums is also out in Japan. They're talking about that in chat right now.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I think that is the same thing you were just referencing a moment ago. It has nothing to do with Gundam. It is like an indie shooter.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I actually was curious, because I like the name Gundamonium, so I actually kind of pulled it up to see more about it.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.000
It kind of looks like a bullet hell type thing, but maybe like, it almost kind of looks like a newer cotton type of game.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Like, I'd be really curious if Jamie's into this, because the way, like with the girl flying with the gun, it kind of looks like cotton on the broom.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:01.000
So I got to show this to Jamie. Man, miss a week, miss a lot. That's like the third time I'm like, Jamie really needed to see that tonight.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Hopefully she'll listen to this week's show.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Also in the next few days, EA Sports UFC 3 gets its Japanese release. That is worth pointing out as well.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Gundamonium is also making its way to the Vita this week, and that's the lone Vita release.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:23.000
We do have in Japan on the Switch, Elder Scrolls V Skyrim gets its Japanese release on, excuse me, February 1st.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2, also its Japanese release on February 1st.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.000
And that is it for the Nintendo Switch. Just quickly, lastly checking here to see if anything is on the 3DS this week.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:45.000
No, we don't see anything for the 3DS in Japan really for quite a while. March 15th is the next big major release.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
So I think the 3DS is really slowing down.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
How about the UK, Loki?

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Okay, UK, we've got a game called Candleman coming out on PC.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age, also on PC, and SteamWorld Dig on the Switch.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:08.000
And then later on, we've got, looks like, actually it looks like that's it.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I thought there would be more. I'm sorely disappointed.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Alright, well usually the Europe, I think our Europe list only covers the big big stuff.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.000
It kind of misses a lot of the indie stuff, so usually it's a little shorter over there.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Anyway, this is the part of the show where I would usually go to the mailbag, but unfortunately, it's empty.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Womp womp. No emails this week.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
But for now, I guess we will move on with some more news, won't we, Loki?

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Yeah, so I'm kind of excited about this.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:46.000
So apparently there's a new Sony patent that shows a possible upgrade to the PlayStation Move controller.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:53.000
That they're going to be doing more of like a VR related kind of update to it.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.000
So with that, they're saying that there's going to be some finger tracking technology as well.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Also, they were saying that there looks like something that's like the Move controller,

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.000
but they've got like an analog stick and some face buttons that look a little bit different.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I don't know. It kind of looks like a trigger similar to...

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000
I don't know. It doesn't really look like a Vive controller or anything.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000
It's definitely different. So as long as it's better than the Move controller, I'm all down with that.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:31.000
One thing I don't see though on this, based on the picture of those, I don't see the glowing ball on the end.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:38.000
So how they're going to use the tracking with that, I don't see anything in this patent referencing the camera either.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000
So I'd be curious to see how it would work tracking the position of that.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
So I got to buy a whole other set up of stuff for that.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Hey, as long as it works better, I don't fucking care.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:57.000
That's really one of the worst things about the PlayStation VR is those Move controllers are fucking old and they don't work very well.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Yeah. I mean, I think everybody was really happy when it's like,

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Oh, these old accessories I got for my PlayStation 3 are going to be beneficial now on VR.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000
And now the reality of the whole, oops, it's 10 years old technology at this point.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:17.000
I'm wondering if they'll get rid of the camera and maybe do something similar to like the beacons that they have for like the Vive and stuff like that.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:24.000
So it'll track it that way. I mean, I can't imagine, I don't know how it would work then based on this picture.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Do you think Sony's plotting another version of their VR headset?

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Is it successful enough to plan a version two that would maybe bring some of this?

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:37.000
They might redesign it a little bit. I don't know if they're going to really, they can't really bump up the specs too much, I would think,

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
because it's really based on the system it's running on.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:46.000
And I do need like a PlayStation 4 Pro if I'm going to, you know, really get into it, but we'll see.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I still need to pick up PlayStation VR. I've been kind of sleeping on that too long, but...

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
They have a lot of bundles nowadays. You can go in with Skyrim VR in it.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Nice. No, check that out. I hear Skyrim VR is pretty neat.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000
It's pretty cool. I just, you know, I just had picked up Skyrim again.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000
So like, I was like, eh, I never really want to spend another $60 on Skyrim.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I'll wait, I'll wait for it to get on sale and then I'll pick it up.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:13.000
All right. Well, let's keep talking about PlayStation here and now finally address what we were kind of referencing a bunch in the first half of the show.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:19.000
And that is, yep, hackers gonna hack, homebrew's gonna homebrew. Here's the deal.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:29.000
So PlayStation 4 hackers and modders have managed to find how to get games running in the PlayStation 4 without legally owning them.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:36.000
This is done with something called PS4 HEN and other modded software that lets the console read backed up games and so forth.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Sony's been releasing new PS4 firmware updates to plug these holes.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:49.000
But the reason why I wouldn't usually bring that up because you should support games and buy games and I'm not here to tell you how to pirate them.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
And I'm only mentioning that because Sony's plugging it up anyway.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Here's why I'm bringing it up is because a new tool from all this apparently allows you to play a backed up PlayStation 2 game on your PlayStation 4.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:09.000
It's called PS2 PUBGEN and it's based on work that was done by another modder.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And it was using that same exploit that uses the PlayStation 4 games. That's why this all comes together.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:23.000
And so via Twitter it was mentioned that they were able to get PlayStation 2 games running like Shinobi and Klonoa 2 on the PlayStation 4.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Klonoa 2 is of special note because that did not work on the PlayStation 3.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
So the PlayStation 4's PS2 emulator seems to be better. Although that could just-

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Although we'll never know because-

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000
We'll never know.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:46.000
So anyway, long story short, basically hackers have just shown that yes you can load. I mean they're backups and they're definitely a legal bad area.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.000
But the reality is you can play PlayStation 2 games on PlayStation 4. This just proves it.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:59.000
I mean we kinda already knew it because of the PlayStation 2 games that they sell on PlayStation 4 in the store.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:07.000
But this shows that it can be run from a backup and essentially you can play, you know, other games that aren't necessarily for sale in the store.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:13.000
So what gives Sony? Hackers beat you to it.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
So now you can no longer say the system's not capable to do it. Well I don't know if Sony really did say that.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000
They've always just sidestepped the question.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Oh it's not something- It's a real minority of gamers who are asking for that. That's always the line that comes up.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:32.000
It's hard to say that though when your competition's doing it quite a bit and they're offering that as some part of their service.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000
So, I don't know.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.000
That being said though, like I have a lot of PlayStation 2 games that I've gotten like in Humble Bundle and stuff.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
I don't play any of them.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000
PlayStation 2?

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Yeah.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000
In Humble Bundle?

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Are you sure you don't mean 3?

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Maybe I mean 3.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
I think you mean 3 because-

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
No, no, I do mean 2 actually.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.000
How? Because Humble Bundle and PlayStation 2, there's no digital storefront there.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
There's PSN.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Not on the 2.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
PlayStation 2 is DVD.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000
For some games they have digital versions of them.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Where would you put it? There was no hard drive.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
There's no hard drive on PS2.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000
PlayStation 2 games that are on the PlayStation 4.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Oh!

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Not PlayStation 2 as in like the whole PlayStation 2.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Oh, the hamster woke up. He's running in the wheel now. I get it.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000
No, no, no. I got like, they did that for like the THQ games.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:28.000
So like, Destroy All Humans, Red Faction, that kind of stuff.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
So I've got a bunch from that.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.000
I just don't necessarily, I don't play it too much.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Well, it's the same issue with Steam.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I own 500 games and I have nothing to play.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Yeah.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
That's exactly-

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Or I'm gonna go back to working on my DDR machine or playing Final Fantasy XIV or Pokemon Go or something.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Yeah.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
I have nothing to play.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Alright, Loki, what's next for us?

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Alright, so this is kind of interesting.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:08.000
So Atari is asking people to invest in a roller tycoon game, roller coaster tycoon game for the Nintendo Switch.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
So they're calling it Roller Coaster Tycoon Switch.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And this is apparently using a crowdfunding service called Start Engine.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:24.000
And they're saying that they're looking to, you know, you have to invest a certain amount of money when you get a certain amount of profits back from it.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
So it's actually revenue sharing.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.000
The only problem with that is, you know, a few things.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:39.000
One, they don't mention Roller Coaster Tycoon Worlds, which was a huge old flop that came out from them not too long ago.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000
They do only mention their first few games and that they have a mobile game.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000
And guess what this looks like a port of?

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Yep, it's the mobile game.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
So they're porting the mobile game to the Switch.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:56.000
And apparently there's another comment saying that regardless of how well this does in the crowdfunding, they're still gonna bring it into the system.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
So why should I pay you money?

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
I don't know.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:05.000
It honestly doesn't look that interesting, especially after the last Roller Coaster Tycoon game that came out.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I don't really believe that they can make modern Roller Coaster Tycoon games.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.000
And this is the same company that hopes to launch a new console real soon, huh?

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Yeah, actually it is.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
The Atari box or whatever they were calling it, right?

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Whatever the fuck that's supposed to be.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Atari, y'all.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.000
MXC in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says this crowdfunding news annoys me a lot.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:33.000
The new Roller Coaster Tycoon is supposedly not a port, but it's by the same developers as the mobile game.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Well, I don't have a problem with that.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000
But based on their screenshots, whether they're showing as gameplay, it looked like the mobile version.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Yeah, well that's probably like their concept or whatever.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Yikes.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Alright, well let's move on to talking about, speaking of old games.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
When I think Atari, I think of old games.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Back when they were like, you know, in their prime.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:46:01.000
This is video game companies looking for an exemption to DMCA laws to preserve online video games.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:09.000
So what happened here is that a notice of proposed rulemaking was published on October 26th.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Where the Copyright Office said they're going to be recommending that the existing exemptions be re-adopted.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000
And the Copyright Office began the public comment period.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:30.000
So one of the proposals that was published said basically permitting circumvention by an eligible library, archives, or museum of TPMs protecting video games for which outside server support has been discontinued.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Specifically, the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment proposes expanding the existing exemption to further include multiplayer online games, video games with online multiplayer features, and massively multiplayer online games, whether stored physically or in downloadable formats, and to add preservationists affiliated with archival institutions as users.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:54.000
So all this news we've been talking about earlier in the show, Miitomo, Paragon, right?

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
These games are things you're not going to be able to play at the end of the year.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Because they're going away.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000
So you will never be able to experience these games again.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Unless, A, hackers do something to allow you to kind of get back in as they've done with Star Wars Galaxy has some bootleg servers and stuff, right?

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Or Final Fantasy XI.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Well technically Final Fantasy XI still exists.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Square's running it. Yeah, Square's running it still. On PC they are.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Really? I thought they shut that down a while ago.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000
No, because they did on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2, but it is still going on PC.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Really?

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Check Steam. Still there.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:41.000
But anyway, so the maid wanted to basically try to preserve these other games, which makes sense.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:51.000
So they wanted an exemption for the DMCA laws so that way they would not get in trouble for running bootleg servers to allow people to experience these old games.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:48:04.000
So maid has gone forth and talked about, you know, video games like Minecraft and Second Life will say as much about 21st century America as Dickens' Oliver's Twist does about 19th century Britain.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
That is, if these games survive into the future.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.000
So, you know, the possibility that Minecraft could go away somehow.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:22.000
So they're asking the Register of Copyrights to recommend a modest expansion of the video game exemption adopted during the last rulemaking to allow for the preservation of abandoned video games that depend on external servers to function.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Online games or online video games.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I mean, it certainly makes sense to me, and as somebody who's a gaming fan, obviously I really want to see this happen.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000
I'll be really curious to see the response from the gaming companies.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Is there going to be a gaming company out there who kind of files to object to this?

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:48.000
And I just don't see who would want to do that and why, unless maybe they want to move their thing to mobile.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Because when you talk about Final Fantasy XI, it does make me think, oh, they were going to do that mobile thing.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Atari. I don't know. I'm just mad at Atari.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Just throw their name out there.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Well, they have done that in the past.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:09.000
I want to say because they were reporting their games to mobile or something. I don't know. Fucking Atari. I don't know. Konami. Who knows.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:14.000
So I'll be very curious to see if any game company kind of petitions to stop this, but I kind of don't see it happening.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:19.000
It's really like, at that point, you made your money to the point where you shut down your servers.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000
So it's not like you're losing, I mean, as you guess, competition.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000
But honestly, how much is that really going to take away from yourself?

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Although, I mean, like Blizzard did come down against the people that are running the classic WoW stuff.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
But then again, WoW is running.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000
To turn around and do what?

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000
To run the same thing.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Warcraft Classic or whatever they're calling it.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000
That'll be out probably by the end of the year, I imagine.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.000
And it's going to suck. I'm telling everybody right now, Warcraft Classic's going to suck.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Everybody's going to play it for a month and be like, God, this is a grind.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:54.000
But there's going to be an audience because there were people that were playing it. So obviously they know.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Honestly, I can't wait for the people who complain all the time about Warcraft Classic to be gone for more than a while.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Sorry, I know that makes me sound like a bitch, but it's just the reality.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Like, a lot of those attitudes kind of need to go to Classic Island.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000
That's another reason why I fully expect WoW Classic's going to be a dumpster fire.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Like, sorry, that's just my opinion.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Well, hopefully they'll learn or make some money out of it.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:31.000
I just think Blizzard's burning money because people are going to play Warcraft Classic for like a month and then be like, God, this really was terrible.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Why did they do this? I should really go buy all their expansions that they put out.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Yeah, maybe they were onto something when they did all these quality of life improvements and so on.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
What are the graphics going to be in WoW Classic?

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Because when WoW Classic first came out, we didn't have widescreen monitors.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
They just don't have graphics.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.000
So are they going to permissibly upgrade the graphics and the purists will be okay with that?

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Or put bars on the side of the screen or what's going to happen?

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000
These are the questions I want to know the answer to.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Maybe we'll get some answers from Blizzard eventually.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:10.000
In the meantime, just a couple more stories and then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Logie?

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:19.000
So you may remember that there was the whole backlash with the loot box situation with Star Wars Battlefront II.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:27.000
And that some senators from various states were kind of getting involved with possibly making legislation to combat it.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:34.000
So one senator that's actually presenting a bill to this is actually a Washington state senator.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:55.000
And Senator Kevin Ranker is actually putting out a bill to investigate whether the items are randomized or not in these different loot boxes and stuff.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
And whether it can qualify as gambling for children and other things.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:06.000
So they basically had, you know, they're doing some investigation whether the mechanisms can be considered gambling under Washington law.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Also if the loot boxes in the games and stuff, if they are considered gambling, if miners should have access to them.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:23.000
And also if there's, you know, lack of disclosure and transparency with respect to the odds of receiving certain items and stuff like that.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:28.000
So they're conducting the research and they're supposed to present their findings by December of this year.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.000
And at which time then they'll decide how to proceed from there.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
So thank you EA for getting that ball rolling.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Here come the judge.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:46.000
They just like overstepped the line and it's going to come back to bite you now.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.000
I think this loot box scenario is going to look very different in a year's time.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
I've kind of been saying that.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
I also think though that they're going to skirt around it somehow though.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:02.000
You know, something, you kind of like how they go around the gambling laws now by the fact that you have to purchase another currency to purchase the loot boxes.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Yeah, I guess maybe. We'll see. We'll see.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000
All right, one more story for you guys here tonight.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
And this is great news.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Apparently Hello Kitty Cruisers is going to be coming to the Switch.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Yippee!

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Yay! That game wasn't very good, but it's a Hello Kitty game.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
There's something that's been out before. Was this on the Wii U?

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
This is on the Wii.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Oh, it was on the Wii U?

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Yeah.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.000
No, it was on the Wii U.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Yeah.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
So let's see. I finally got the story to pull up here.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:36.000
So Hello Kitty obviously is like a Mario Kart type of knockoff game, but it's Hello Kitty and friends.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.000
And yeah, through a partnership with Sanrio, blah, dee, blah, dee, blah.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Hello Kitty video game titles to fans and new audiences.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:48.000
I think 2018 is when they're saying this will come out on the Switch in the US, Canada, and Latin America.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:55.000
So if you have not had the chance to experience Hello Kitty Cruisers, you will get that opportunity.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:02.000
I suppose I could take this opportunity to also mention maybe a game a few more of you are probably interested in.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.000
And that's the Secret of Mana remake.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.000
So also talking about potentially the Nintendo Switch for that platform.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:16.000
So the PlayStation 4, the Vita, yes Vita, and the PC are getting the Secret of Mana remake.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
So why not the Nintendo Switch?

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Well, producer Masaru Omaeda made some comments about that to kind of give background in terms of when the project started.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.000
It was about two years ago and the Switch hadn't been announced.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Once we had announced this particular remake title, we were very surprised to see the amount of demand and feedback we received for a potential Switch version.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
So the voices are heard.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:45.000
We're aware that people are desiring a Switch version and we will make an effort to see what's feasible in the future, though nothing is confirmed or planned.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:53.000
So it probably has to do, and you know what it's going to come down to, it's going to come down to how well does it sell on PlayStation 4 and PC and the other platforms.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.000
And that may sound weird because, well, but we want it on Switch.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
But the reality is, they're going to need to pay those teams to port it over to the Switch.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Yeah, if it doesn't do well on a platform that has a larger audience then it's not worth porting it over.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:12.000
That's just the reality of it. I know it doesn't logically make sense because there's going to be a lot of you that are like, well, shit, I'm just going to wait for it to come out on the Switch, I'm not going to buy it.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:19.000
But reality is, probably not going to happen if it doesn't sell well enough on the other platforms. So get your friends to buy it on other platforms.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Anyhow, the second Atsetsu collection, by the way, you know that came out on the Switch, except we never got it here.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Oimada also commented on this saying, obviously our focus is on Secret of Mana since we're in the last part of its development, so obviously it's hard to definitely say yes, we will release it.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:47.000
But we've obviously heard a lot of demands and requests for that game to be released in the West, and that's something we will do our best to hopefully achieve, but nothing at this moment in time.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.000
So he's doing a lot of this getting our hopes up shit.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Oimada also kind of wondered, are people over here going to get it? Because Second Atsetsu 3 is linked to the Mana series because there was nothing outside.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Dude, people will get it. It's fine. If Final Fantasy can be understood over here, you're going to be fine.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Yeah.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Anyway, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, AkumaJP said, did you know inside Hello Kitty was an old man? He has been the Hello Kitty costume character for 20 years.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:28.000
It doesn't surprise me. They made a whole documentary about the guy who did Elmo.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Apparently the guy that was wearing the costume for Barney is now a tantric massage therapist.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Yeah, so the people that are putting on the puppet show don't look like the puppets. That's even true with Hello Kitty.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
They're all in the kinky sex thing, so...

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Allegedly.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Allegedly.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Alright. Anyway, Skype line's open, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe something else.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.000
I know it's a little early in the show. It ended up being a bit of a shorter show tonight, but without Jamie.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.000
And I know the Grammys are happening tonight, which I haven't watched the Grammys in like 20 years.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I mean, most of that is thanks to this show being on Sunday nights, but I'm just like, did Meghan Trainor win a Grammy tonight?

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:18.000
I think I saw a picture of her holding a Grammy. If she actually, if she won a Grammy, that tells you all you need to know about why I don't watch the Grammys.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I did hear Patti LuPone showed up, though. I would watch a YouTube of that. But it'll be on YouTube. I don't need to watch it live.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Alright. No last minute stories, huh? Sure. Oh, okay, yay.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000
So there's a...

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Wait, we got a call. Hold that thought, Loki.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Hello.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000
We're gonna get to this call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
What's up, everyone? It's Rama.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Hey, Rama. What's on your mind, buddy?

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:54.000
A lot of good stuff, but you say Grammys. I say WWE Royal Rumble, so that's where my, that's where part of my priorities were tonight.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Is that also on tonight?

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Yes.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:05.000
See, this might surprise you, but that one I kind of get. Just like, I understand next week is the Super Bowl, and we're a little silly for doing a show anyway.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:14.000
But the reality is, a big part of this audience listens on the podcast, so they're gonna listen when it's convenient for them when there's no major award shows.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:22.000
And we hope the regular Sunday night people that opt to do the Super Bowl thing instead are gonna listen to the show at their convenience through the podcast at some point throughout the week.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000
So, you know, we're still gonna be here doing our thing.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:33.000
That will be me, because I'll be going to a Fuck the Patriots party next week, so you know, that's gonna be good times all around.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:41.000
You know what, you bring up a good point. Like, why do people care about the Super Bowl this time around? Especially, and keep in mind, Rama, I'm coming from a West Coast perspective.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:50.000
You have two teams, and I don't follow the NFL very closely, but my understanding is these two teams are not very well-liked outside of their areas.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Pretty much. It's like, next Sunday, all of America, except for the New England State, because we don't count them, will be rooting for the Philadelphia Eagles.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Because, like the Red Sox...

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
They're not the Patriots.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Look, I am a flaming homosexual man who doesn't care a lot about football, and even I understand that, Rama.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.000
See, but I would have figured you'd be watching the Super Bowl for the tight end.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:23.000
No, usually I watch for the halftime concert. You know, the Beyonce concert featuring a football game.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:28.000
The Lady Gaga concert featuring a football game. I don't give a fuck about Justin Timberlake.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Okay, alright, alright. I give you that. I give you that. Please, I just don't want to hear all the way in Sacktown, you shouting, yes, queen, all the way.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:46.000
No. That is only going to happen if Janet Jackson takes her rightful place, rightful place, by his side on that stage.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:52.000
And if that doesn't happen, I don't give a fuck. I don't give one fuck, two fucks, red fucks, blue fucks.

01:59:52.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Unless Janet Jackson gets her rightful place and her fucking apology from the NFL. I'm sorry, I'm on my fucking soapbox now.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Janet Jackson deserves a fucking apology from the NFL, from CBS, from the entire fucking country, owes Janet Jackson a huge apology.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Jesus Christ, what did I do? I think I just actually summoned Rob Skinner's sass. Holy shit.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
I'm sorry, I'm on a bender tonight. What can I say?

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:32.000
It's all good, because we all love it when you get sassy like that. We love it. After you get sassy, we just hand you back your crown and be like, here, sorry, we're sorry, we'll touch it again.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Rama, it was a titty, and everybody went fucking nuts. It was a titty.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Oh, I just remember what Chris Rock said about that, but that's a story for another time.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000
It's not like y'all ain't looking up titties anyway.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:55.000
She accidentally put one out there for free, and it was still covered by that weird fucking metal thing.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:04.000
And you can't tell me that, like, who is it that, like, there's been several costumes, like, even during these award shows, where it's just, like, Boob just fucking hanging out.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:09.000
And Lil' Kim at the MTV Awards. Like, her outfit was her tit.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:19.000
The nipple wasn't showing. The nipple wasn't showing. The nipple was in the middle.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Oh, is that where they are, Loki?

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.000
No, they had the thing over it, but it was pierced through that or something. I don't know.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:32.000
She had that metal thing on. You couldn't even see it. We didn't even fucking have HD then. That's the thing.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000
I don't know.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000
It wasn't even HD.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Let's go back to what I was talking about earlier this week. So, apparently, I was going through my old computer stuff, and I have all my LiveJournal icons, and someone had made me a LiveJournal icon that was Janet Jackson's nipple thing with my name on it.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.000
And so, yes, it was there, because it's blown up to a LiveJournal icon.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.000
I don't remember her full nipple being on display, but even if it was...

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.000
It was on TV, and it was super, like, zoom in on that shit.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Go to a beach in France, for fuck's sake. God. Anyway, sorry, Rami. I know you didn't call in to talk about titties, but, you know.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Yeah, well, it's all good. I'm not gonna complain.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Wait, what's that?

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.000
It's all good. You know, I'm not gonna complain.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Alright, sounds good. Wait, was there something actually video gaming related we were supposed to be talking about?

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Yeah, I wanted to talk about a couple things now. The Duke Nukem movie. Okay.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:34.000
John St. John, the voice of Duke Nukem. Oh, he is thoroughly pissed.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:41.000
He has started a grassroots campaign to have somebody else play John Cena.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Now, some people don't remember, but about a good 15, nearly 20 years ago, there was talk of a Duke Nukem movie, right after Duke Nukem 3D.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:03:01.000
It was supposed to be with Brian Bonsworth. But, as you can see, that kinda felt flat on its face.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Right, as a lot of movies never do get off the ground.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:13.000
It is what it is. I mean, honestly, Cena has it all, except for the personality. That's basically it.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Unfortunately, I mean, this is the reality of Hollywood, and I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way it is.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:28.000
John St. John doesn't have that name recognition that John Cena does. He will be lucky if he gets a cameo in the movie after this. He should hope for a cameo.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Basically.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:36.000
And I'm not saying I agree with it, I'm just saying, that's what happens in Hollywood. If you don't like it, don't see the movie.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Basically. Now, about the whole streaming thing you all were talking about earlier. I'll tell you this, between different platforms, I find streaming to Facebook Live is like the easiest thing.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Really?

02:03:50.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Like, webcam, fire it up, that's it. It's so easy. I mean, that's what a lot of people I see at conventions are doing. Like, they got their booth set up, they just fire up Facebook Live and just run the stream. It's just that simple. You don't need any special software.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.000
That's fair. The ease of doing it is certainly a big part of it.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:21.000
But there are a couple of websites out there where if you use them as the proxy, and you program it, it'll stream to other streaming sites as well. Makes it look easy, which I think is a great idea.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:36.000
You know what's interesting though, if you're a Twitch affiliate, you can't use stuff like that. Because the content you put on Twitch, I hope I'm not screwing up the agreement, but the content you put on Twitch has to be exclusive to Twitch for 24 hours.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:43.000
So you can still put your backups on YouTube the next day or whatever, but it has to be exclusive to Twitch for 24 hours. You can't do that multi stream stuff.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:56.000
They also, they do not bar you from using other streaming services. You can use Facebook and you can use Mixer. They're not gonna, you know, that would be, I think a lot of people would have a problem with that if they were to close all your other doors.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:03.000
But you can't stream the same thing you're doing on Twitch to these other platforms. That's actually in their agreement. Just a thing you may not know about.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Now obviously not everybody is an affiliate or a partner, but it does seem like they're letting more and more people get in on that affiliate program. So just something to consider.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000
You know what, I personally don't have a problem with that.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Rami, you're cutting out a little bit. All I heard was that I don't have a problem with it.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000
My bad. I guess, let me, let me, let me turn up the porn torrents. I'm sorry.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Okay. Do you say the porn torrents?

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Yes I do.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Okay.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:42.000
I mean, personally, I don't have a problem with waiting 24 hours because I go to conventions, let's say I'm recording panels or live stream or something like that, like the Masquerade.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:50.000
I'm not gonna mess with the footage until I get back Monday or Tuesday. So by all means, enjoy it.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Yeah.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:06:00.000
And honestly with Twitch, like if you want to watch stuff like, like the DDR tournament yesterday, it's not on YouTube yet, but just go to dude's Twitch archive. It's all there.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:06.000
And people are even making clips already. And even when I was watching today, I accidentally hit that clip.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:12.000
But that's one thing I don't like about Twitch is that if you accidentally hit that clip button, then you just made like a garbage clip of some of these feed.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000
But anyway, my point is that you can watch that stuff on demand right away.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:21.000
And Bobby's pointing out another change that's happened to Twitch lately saying, I'm ready to go full on Twitch at this point.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Apparently you can upload videos and debut them at a specific time on Twitch now and then have a group viewing party.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:39.000
That is true. Twitch is trying to kind of push into YouTube space there a little bit, but they're still trying to keep it live by like your new video debuts at this time.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:45.000
But if you're not super into that concept, you can set the debut time as like 30 minutes from after you upload it.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000
I think the minimum is like on the half hour after you upload it.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
I think that's pretty cool.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:59.000
I do too. I think it's neat. It's a concept I may explore more. I gotta be careful what I promise I deliver, especially since I'm doing the three podcast thing.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:05.000
But obviously Twitch is something I do still definitely want to expand on when time permits.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:10.000
It kind of makes your Twitch stream sort of like your own independent TV station if you think about it.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:17.000
So I haven't really played around with Twitch that much, but I got a couple of projects in the works.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:22.000
But right now I may just stick with Facebook Live just to see how it works.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Sure.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Well, we'll see.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
We'll see.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Also, another thing with Twitch, if you're if you're worried about the barrier to entry, you might want to check out this was just released.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Streamlabs just released their own version of Open Broadcast Studio, OBS, which is like the very popular streaming software.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:46.000
And a lot of people kind of find that software, it's not exactly the easiest thing in the world to use.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:50.000
So some people get intimidated by that. You have to kind of watch some tutorials to get the sense of it.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:54.000
But I think Streamlabs version has a lot of built in stuff already.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Now, my disclaimer, I actually haven't used this myself yet, but I'm curious to check it out because Streamlabs, they're the ones that are doing a lot of the overlays that people are already using.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:12.000
For example, when somebody clicks the subscribe button and I get that little gif that comes up that says, you know, Rama just subscribed to your station.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
So I can go, yay, thank you, Rama.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:19.000
You know, that is all from Streamlabs is that basically you have to import Streamlabs website into your feed to get that to display.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Well, now that Streamlabs basically has its own studio software, it's all kind of integrated.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000
So it's going to make that process, I think, easier for some people.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000
So just to kind of piggyback on what you said about people are using Facebook because it's easier.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Some people are recognizing that about Twitch.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
That's a little more difficult to just jump in and do.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.000
So maybe some of those walls are going to come down.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Yeah, hopefully, because if you're using Streamlabs or something like that, you have to have a decent power desktop or laptop to use it.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Whereas with Facebook Live, I mean, I have a Surface 3 laptop and that's an Atom processor.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:57.000
I can use that and just jump right on live and just rock and roll.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Yeah, for sure.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:05.000
All right. Well, Rama, I'm going to let you go because we've been on a call a little while, but I want to make sure we free it up for some other folks.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000
But I hope everybody listens to Anime Jam Session.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
And thanks for calling, as always.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Yeah, cool. No problem. Keep it real, bro.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
All right. I always do. Take care, buddy.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000
You too. Bye.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.000
OrangeLoungeRadio all one word on Skype.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Loki, you were starting to do a last minute story and I cut you off.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Yes. So there is this Kickstarter for an application called NES Maker.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:32.000
So basically what is NES Maker? It's making NES games without coding.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.000
We did bring this up on the show last week, just so you know. Sorry.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000
That's awesome. And they've already hit their goal and they're...

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Oh, they hit their goal?

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Yeah, they're way over their goal.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:44.000
They're 139,000 of their 32,000 goal.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.000
So the newest, last time I checked this, their new goal was the music maker part of it.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:56.000
But they've hit like a bunch of stretch goals, adventure module, platformer, RPG, brawler and shooter modules have been...

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Dude, that music maker is going to be awesome.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:03.000
You know, I kind of had to force myself to learn GarageBand because Victoria and I were like,

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.000
where are we going to get an intro for our new show?

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000
And I was like, I really kind of want to get away from using existing songs.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
I'm like, how hard can GarageBand be?

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.000
I said, Slagkick from Gamebooie told me he made the intro to R.I.F. in GarageBand.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
So how hard can GarageBand be?

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:24.000
So I actually like tried to force myself to like learn how to use GarageBand and make loops.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.000
But what you may not know is that Victoria did the same thing.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.000
And the intro you're actually hearing to Shaky and Crying is the one she did.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:39.000
So it was better. I couldn't get away from it sounding like the stock footage thing.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.000
But anyway, the reason why I bring that up is that if they bring out an NES maker that's similar to like GarageBand

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:51.000
and, you know, kind of putting stuff together, that could be really cool for people that want to do more Chiptune stuff.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Yeah, I do want to check this out. It seems like a neat idea. I don't know.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.000
I'm not interested necessarily in the module that actually dump it to a cart, so I don't have an NES.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:06.000
As is my reservation with most Kickstarters in the year 2018,

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:10.000
but I really hope this team is able to deliver the product they're promising.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:17.000
You'll have to excuse me if I am extremely skeptical in the year 2018.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Yeah, I understand. At least the target date's not until August.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000
I mean, that's not that far away, but, you know, that's a good pushback.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
All right, good luck.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Any other last minute stories?

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Yeah, apparently during the whole like I think Dota event that was going on,

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:35.000
there was a Valve presentation and one of the first things that people were asking

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.000
for, Half-Life 3, they said was, yeah, we're still making games and people laughed

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
because they didn't believe them, but apparently they're still making games.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Oh, well, okay. Who knew?

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Just some day we'll hear about them.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.000
That's all I got.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000
All right, OrangeLoungeRadio, one more shout out for the Skypline.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Rama in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Carrie Fisher wins the Grammy posthumously.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.000
That's the only relevance to the Grammys. Fair enough.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:11.000
MXC says OBS is still open source, so it seems the Streamlabs thing is built on top of the OBS engine

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:14.000
and that's okay because OBS is open source. Yes, true.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:21.000
That OBS really killed, what was the other big one people had to use before it?

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:24.000
It was X something. People had XSplit, I think.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:27.000
And they wanted to charge quite a bit of money for it and they still do.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000
I think it's still out there.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.000
They're probably trying to give you some reason to keep it.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.000
But man, OBS, I mean, it's free and it's pretty easy to use, I think.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:42.000
But I also, keep in mind, when I was in college, I was actually studying like television

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:47.000
and I did things like edit a music video and edit some of those jokes from Understation Live

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.000
that were the mini movies that I was in that some of you, I'm reaching here,

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
but some of you that have been listening to the show a long time know what I'm talking about.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Some of those in-jokes from Understation Live, those things that were college projects

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:02.000
that we were editing. So my point with that is a lot of those same concepts and things

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000
were like on the software we were using then that are in OBS.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.000
So it's not that hard for me to use.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:13.000
But anyway, we do have another call coming in, so I'm going to get to it if it will load here.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
I think it's taking us time to connect.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's this?

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Hey, it's dark. Good to see you.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Hey, we haven't heard from you in a while. How are you?

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Well, I mean, you're always in chat. We don't get to Skype with you much.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000
What's on your mind?

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Oh, just a couple of quick things.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Yeah. Go for it.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Hey, quick question for Loki. Did you happen to find anything on that hard drive when you were transferring?

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Like find what? I found all my mix show stuff.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Yeah, anything like OLR related because I guess Missy had asked about it on Twitter. I don't know if you saw that.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Oh, they're looking for Orange Laundry Radio archive stuff.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Yeah, I didn't keep any of the episodes.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Yeah, no, he never had episode masters. That was really all me.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:11.000
And yeah, I assure you between Missy and DDR Angel and some of the other big collectors, you guys had it all.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Everything. In fact, when Missy was here, I dumped everything from my archives and gave it to her.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:23.000
So yeah, unfortunately, there are a handful of episodes that are just they're gone right now.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Yeah.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:33.000
But the good news is, I mean, like most honestly, it's probably only at most like 50 episodes that are gone.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Like there's still a whole time. And who knows that they might turn up someday.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:43.000
I still have old computers sitting around here. And if I find some old hard drives, I'll take a look for you. You never know.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:48.000
That's okay. Because if we miss some of the old episodes, then I'll make my presidential run easier later on.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says those were the best 50 episodes, obviously.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Excuse me, you're listening to the best episode happening right now and the 49 before it, obviously. Thank you.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:07.000
No, she had pinged me on Twitter. So I thought I'd act about that.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Appreciate it. Well, anything else on your mind, Dr. Tzuyu?

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Just one quick thing. Did you know that President Cat had made her Twitch debut late last year?

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:23.000
No, like as an actual streamer or somebody playing the game.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Yeah, someone was playing the game this late last year.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:36.000
I knew about the retro streamer guy because you sent us a tweet on it.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:43.000
And I had something else going on IRL, so I wasn't able to watch it live. But I know somebody did do it. I did see the tweets about it.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Yeah, that's Retro Pals on Twitch. I do recommend checking them out. They play a lot of older stuff.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:57.000
I have nothing against Retro Pals. I'm sure they're an awesome stream and the fact that you like them I'm sure makes them awesome and good.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:05.000
But I seem to recall, Loki, did we not broadcast President Cat when you bought it on Justin TV back in the day?

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Because we were in the studio set up.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Maybe. I don't remember.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000
I feel like we did. Because I know we played it.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.000
I'd still have it somewhere.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:21.000
I think we did, Dr. Tzuyu. I don't know if they did it first. They might be the first to do it on Twitch, though, because when we were streaming it was on Justin.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Yeah. Oh yeah.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.000
So.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Alright, well my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can see if we can get any more calls. But thanks so much for calling. It's always a pleasure to hear from you.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Yeah, sure.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Take care.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Yep, thank you.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Alright. OrangeLounge Radio, all one word on Skype if we get any last minute. You got a call right now because I'm about to close it up.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Loki, anything else to note here?

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:48.000
No.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:58.000
No? I noticed Mr. Smoosh has come out into the studio and made himself known. He wants to get some pets from Loki and probably wants to get some food too at some point.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:05.000
That's usually why he wakes up from his nap. Hopefully will not keep me awake at all hours of the night. This is the latest thing he likes to do.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:10.000
If the blinds are pulled in the bedroom, which, you know, we don't like to have the sunlight in. The blinds are usually pulled.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:16.000
He will jump up on the windowsill and start clawing at the blinds so he can see through them.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Oh yeah, I remember my cat used to do that. Trying to get it behind the blinds.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Annoying. Annoying. And then last night his snoring was so loud that Alan ended up going out to the couch.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Because he couldn't sleep through Mr. Smoosh's snoring. He snores so loud. He didn't already know Mr. Smoosh is my cat.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Alright, well that's it. No more calls are coming in so I think we're going to wrap up the show.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry Radio.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Hey, as we say every week on the show, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but if you guys aren't out there, we can't get your voices on here.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Always appreciate having some new voices here at Orange Laundry Radio.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.000
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play or wherever it is you found this show.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:17.000
That goes a very long way so we really appreciate those where you can do that.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:23.000
That really does it for the show. I guess it's time for final thoughts. Loki, any final thoughts you want to get out?

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:34.000
I'm going to hopefully keep playing DDR and see about foam modding those pads because that's only like 20 bucks to do that so I may start that this week.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Alright, and I guess my final thought is Mr. Smoosh wants me to take more pictures for his Instagram, huh? Yeah.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Mr. Smoosh likes being a celebrity, doesn't he? You spoiled kitty.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:51.000
We'll be back in seven days. Hopefully Jamie's back and we can all do this again here at Orange Laundry Radio.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Thanks so much for tuning in tonight. We'll see you next Sunday. I am aware there is a big football game on but we'll still be here nevertheless.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:04.000
So join us either on the podcast feed or be here live because I'm pretty sure the football game ends before we do.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
So come join us. We'll see you in seven days. Have a good night.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:14.000
