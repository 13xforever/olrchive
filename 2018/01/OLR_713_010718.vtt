00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Hello from the other side, it's 2018. New year, new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:18.000 --> 00:26.000
We're starting off by reviewing the past and predicting the future. This, the year's gaming new so far and so much more starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:48.000
Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 713 for this January 7th, 2018, our first show of the new year since we had just done a show on New Year's Day.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
Excuse me, New Year's Eve. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
We are live at the Voice Geeks Network as we are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
If you are listening to us live, thank you for choosing us over the Golden Globes for one because I don't, I don't understand.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Like the Golden Globes is what? Like the Hollywood Foreign Press is like 80 people. Who cares? Anyway, whatever.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
And awesome games done quick.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Oh, hey, you're back. Welcome. DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Wise from your grave.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
Yes. Now, okay, if you're skipping us for awesome games done quick, that one I get.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
But you can have it running quiet on the side while you listen to us.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
We don't have a video stream. Oh, that's the new excuse I'm going to use for why we don't do video.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
So you can watch other charity video streams. Well, who not? 2018, don't rule anything out. That's all I'm going to say.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
So anyway, hi DarkSakura. I hope you're doing well.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm doing better.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
I know you weren't able to join us on New Year's Eve, but I hope everything's all right.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
Well, I'm not taking any coding right now, so I'm lucid.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
And I'm not going to, a few people know what happened.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm just going to give a little bit of information because it's nobody's business.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
But I did have surgery. I'm in recovery for a month. I'm recovering fine. I just get really tired.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Well, if you need to take a nap, you can go crawl in with Mr. Swoosh.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
I'm currently reclined in this chair, so that might, you know.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Hey, Jamie, what's next in the news tonight?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
All right. Well, always here. Well, almost always here. I mean, he takes a week off now and then two, but he's here tonight.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Hello, I'm here.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Hey, Loki, how you doing?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
I'm fine.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Good. So we were having a little conversation as we usually do before the show.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
We are a show about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, but gaming culture, it tends to bleed into other things too, right?

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
So one of the random topics we were talking about before going live tonight while Bobby was wrapping up his show,

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
we were talking about movies that scared the hell out of us as a kid.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
Now, keep in mind, we're all late thirties, early forties here.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
So, you know, we might come from a different generation than some of you listening, but I'm sure some of you know these movies.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
So, so quickly, Loki, what was a movie that scared the hell out of you as a kid?

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
Um, I would say probably, I know some like, I think it was American.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
American Tail? Was it the first one maybe? Like, I'm getting...

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Oh yeah, I remember the American Tail. Fievel, was that the little mouse's name?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, I think it was the first American Tail.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
It was Don Bluth.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah, they made a ton of those movies.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
Which, relating to games Don Bluth did, Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, he was a very prolific animator.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
That wasn't that bad.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
And Xanadu.

03:23.000 --> 03:30.000
The one movie that I saw, I mean, that didn't really kind of creep me out, but like one that kind of stuck with me was The Gate, which was kind of...

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
That movie was great.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
I don't know that one.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
It was terrible.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
It's the one where the kids open a portal to hell in their backyard using a heavy metal album.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
What?

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
And one of the kids gets like an eyeball in his hand and has to stab it out and everything.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Yeah, that's the scene that I remember.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
I don't, I have no, oh my god, was it rated R? I wasn't allowed to watch it.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
And they had like the portal inside their house and had like the balcony around.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Yeah, they have like little like gremlin troll things that are popping out.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
See, I wasn't allowed to watch R.E. movies growing up.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I did that at a friend's house, of course, and then when their parents were home.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
My mom wouldn't let me watch gremlins. She thought it was too scary.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
I saw gremlins in the theater.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Oh my god. I hear that movie fucked up a lot of people.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Eleven. I think I was eleven. Ten or eleven. Yeah.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Gremlins was great. You know, the thing is, is that like not movies weren't very scary to me.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
There were only two movies that actually gave me nightmares after.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
And one of them was The Thing.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
But that movie, I can't even watch it as an adult.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
The John Carpenter.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Oh yeah.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah. And the other one is, believe it or not, it doesn't do it anymore.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
But when I was a kid, Poltergeist 3.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
OK, they were just saying in chat, Tiger Claw said, what about Poltergeist?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Oh, that's a good one.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
The first Poltergeist was my favorite movie when it came out.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Oh my gosh.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
My sister.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I wasn't allowed to watch it.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
My sister and I used to use the car as the TV and she would be Carol Ann because she was blonde.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
That's awesome.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
But no, I love I fucking love the first one. The second one was shit.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
But the third one, because I had a mirror phobia.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Did they have a Poltergeist game on Atari 2600?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
I don't remember.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
It would have been terrible.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
It probably was.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Well, some of the movie games like Indiana Jones was really good.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
But anyway, I went through a period of time where I actually had a minor mirror phobia.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Wow.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Yeah, it wasn't very big.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
But after I saw the movie, because, you know, the thing was going through the mirror and everything, I was obsessed with all the special effects.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
And I loved it.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
I loved it. Even knowing how they did everything.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
It was I couldn't look in a mirror for about a week.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Other than that, there's only three scenes and something that's fucked me up.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
And they all have to do with faces melting or faces doing weird things.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh, like in Indiana Jones.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
In Gremlins and Indiana Jones, you know, where Stripe melted.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Spoiler, Stripe melts.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Well, come on, that movie's how old?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Kidding.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
The face melting in Indiana Jones and Large Marge in Pee Wee.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Oh, God.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Large Marge. You didn't even say that one before the show.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
That movie.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Oh, my God.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I love that scene.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
You know, that actress just passed away.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Not even a couple weeks ago.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
No, she did not melt.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
She was also because I.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
OK, look.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Till Large Marge sent you.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
You all know that I am married to a guy, so therefore I'm homosexual.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
One of those.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
You know, I don't like to buy into all the gay stereotypes sometimes,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
but, you know, I love me some Mommy Dearest.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
And so Large Marge was also Helga in Mommy Dearest.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I'm not mad at you Helga.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I'm mad at the dirt.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
For anyone who saw that movie.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
All right.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
You know, I'm going to quote Mommy Dearest.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Although you say Helga, now I think of Clay Fighter.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
What about Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Oh, yeah.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Oh, that movie.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Yeah, the scene in that one did it.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
It's really just.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
That game too.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Shit.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
But I it's just the scenes will still kind of get me for the same reasons,

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
because I know that they're fake and terrible, but they'll still do it.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Other than that, though, I mean, like.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
I've seen a lot of movies in the theater that I was technically too young to see.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
You know, so I don't care.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
OK, so here's mine.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
So my uncle took me to see Kroll and that was awesome.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
My mom did try to protect me from a lot of the scary stuff,

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
but we went to the movie theater and nobody in chat has said this yet.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
I can't believe this.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
This is for me.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
This is the king of all like movies that will fuck you up as a kid.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
I saw in the theater taken by my mother to see Return to Oz.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Fucking love it.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
I love the first one.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Exactly right.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Because you think, oh, right.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
It's the it's the sequel to The Wizard of Oz.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Although in reality, it's more complicated than that.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Those books became public domain at some point or something.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Disney got the rights.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I don't know what happened.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
So they they made because if you didn't know The Wizard of Oz,

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
like bomb wrote like what, like twenty three books.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
And then there were, I think, some

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
pseudonym used his name as a non de plume.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
So so anyway, they took to two of the books and they kind of combined it.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
And they made Return to Oz, which if you didn't know,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Dorothy was Fruza Balk, who later was in the craft.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Right. So the whole thing starts with like her at a mental institution,

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
trying to escape, getting like electro shock therapy and like all these people

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
turning into stones.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
And then the wicked queen has all the heads in the jars.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Like that fucked me up.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
That movie, I think.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
My God, that was by far like the scariest movie, I think.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
And that movie is only rated like PG.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I don't think the movie that my son,

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
my youngest son loves Coraline.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
I love Coraline.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
I haven't seen it.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
That's a pretty twisted movie, too.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Is it?

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
It's actually super faithful to the book, too.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
And I really I love both the book and the movie.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
It's like this demon that tries to lure children into this,

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
like other dimension to basically steal their soul.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
When I when I was a kid, it is an animated movie,

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
but it was animated for adults.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
It was a movie called Rock and Rule.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Rock and Rule Racing.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
I love that game.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Rock and Rule.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Rock and Rule.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
And it was like this future post-apocalyptic where basically rodents

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
became the dominant species, the humanoid rodents.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
And I'm trying to remember the soundtrack to it never got a full release,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
but it was Iggy Pop, Deborah Harry.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
The one who was the speaking voice of the main girl in that movie was also

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Sailor Jupiter in the U.S. Sailor Moon.

09:19.000 --> 09:27.000
But the movie was really kind of like on that odd edge of kind of glam had

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
like the bad guy was like a glam rock guy who is certainly supposed to emulate

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
David Bowie.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Just evil.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
But the movie, you know, was so it was beyond what I was supposed to have

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
been watching, but I fucking love that movie.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
Never had a U.S. release on any home media except for one limited VHS

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
and a Canadian laserdisc.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
And then they released it on DVD when I was an adult.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
And guess who fucking bought it?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Of course you did.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I also bought a bootleg that was taped off of HBO.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
You know, not to shift the topic back to gaming a little bit.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
No, that's OK.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
You talk about David Bowie inspiration, like David Bowie inspired so much

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
and even still today.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Like you look at Moira in Overwatch is the thing that comes to mind for me.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
They just introduced her a couple of months ago.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
She's very David Bowie.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
I think one of her skins is like straight up Aladdin same.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Like it's just it's pretty cool.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
Like you see Bowie's influence in movies and gaming and beyond.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Well, Bowie was always very technically savvy to you.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
He had that computer game in ninety nine.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
You did it for Classic Game of the Week once.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
He was very technically savvy with all that stuff.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
But anyway, I'm digressing a bit.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I do have to give one more statement about that.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
The other people who did music in that.

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
It was Cheap Trick, Chris Stein, Deborah Harry, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and Earth Wind and Fire.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
It's just like it's like a who's who of like awesome stars from that day.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
But oh my God, it was so good.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
All right. Anyway, we do want to get into games.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
And in fact, being that it is the first show of the year,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
we thought and Dark Soccer is back with us tonight.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
We thought, what better time to revisit the time capsule?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Do you remember this from a few months ago?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah. And some of you thought, boy, you guys are really dumb.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
Putting together a time capsule in the summer that you're going to open in six months.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Like what's the suspense in that?

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Y'all gaming changes so fast.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
I mean, I don't know about you guys, but I've already talked about this before.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
How like I'll go from one game to another so fast.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Right. Like, you know, I might be playing Overwatch or something and then squirrel.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
You know, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 comes out and I go play that for a little bit.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
And then the next week, something else comes out.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
You know, there's that. And, you know, just the way technology moves and changes.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
Right. Like think about how far we've come in the year at this point last year.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
I think we had just had that Switch press conference that told us here is the Switch and this is what it is.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
And this is the launch date and all that. And before that, we knew very little.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
That was just one year ago.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
And how many rooftop parties has the Switch cost?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Zero.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Well, we don't know.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Totally let down.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
4K gaming, you know, was not something we had really a year ago.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
It's still not really something we have now.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Maybe for the highest NPCs. But come on, we do have Forza, you know, is that.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
We've got more games coming out. Xbox One X is a thing.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
So, I mean, gaming changes that fast. Technology shifts that fast.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
So it's a little bit tongue in cheek that we do this segment.

12:20.000 --> 12:27.000
But, you know, man, I don't know how many of you guys go back and listen to old Orange Lounge radios.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
But some of the shit that comes out of our mouths about predictions and things like that.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
And just, you know, if only we knew then what we knew now, it's crazy.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
All right. So anyway, let's get to it.

12:38.000 --> 12:46.000
So a few months ago, we put away in this time capsule some I think some questions or some statements about what are we going to discover in 2018.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
And tonight we will be filling it back up.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
Not only with our comments, but some of yours in our chat as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
So I think the best way to do this. So I'm going to take our Vader time capsule here and I'm going to open up his head.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
And I'm going to pull one thing out and then I'll pass it around.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Each person can pull something out. This is only fun.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Oh, my God. This thing is full.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Maybe we are going to have a three hour show tonight.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I don't remember.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
We're into this kind of quick.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
All right. So somebody wrote this down.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
This looks like Matt's handwriting.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Skyrim remastered.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
Oh, I think these are the three games you like right now.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Why do we have three games randomly written down?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Well, here's the thing.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
You put Skyrim remastered until dawn rush of blood Skyrim remastered.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
So I think these are like the games we were playing over the summer.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Top three games so far of the year.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Oh, am I supposed to do that?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Should we do that again?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
I don't.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Let's do that. But that's actually right where they are.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
There's only been like a week's worth of games.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
All right. I'm going to do two.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I mean, our top three for the last year.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Last year.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
We can do that. Sure.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
All right.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Cool.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I have one less thing I have to think of.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Label it as that.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
All right.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
I'm going to open two.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
So this other one says, oh, I wrote this.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Did any accessories go down in price yet?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And that was signed Dungeon Buster and Rob.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
So he must have said something in chat.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Did any accessories go down in price yet?

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
I think he's talking about the Switch accessories.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Because they were all expensive.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
Well, they discontinued a Microsoft accessory this week.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Sort of. Sort of.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
We'll get into that later.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Not going down in price.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
No, the Switch accessory sure as hell didn't go down in price.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
That's for sure.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
They're still releasing new colors and new schemes and all that stuff.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
So I don't know.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Scheme is the right word for that.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah, there you go.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
All right. Pick a couple out of these here, Loki, and read them for us.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
OK, let's see.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
All right.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
It's only got one piece.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
One big piece.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Somebody shoved a whole piece of paper in there.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Is that Jamie?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
This is mine.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
All right, what'd you put?

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
OK, so this is what I put as, yep, it has my name on it.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
OK.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Of course it's mine.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Oh, we did this back in March.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
I thought it was in June.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Oh, I thought it was in the summer.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
No, March 5th.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
OK, so it almost is here.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
We dated it.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
All right.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
OK.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I bet they delayed Super Mario Odyssey.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
So you were wrong on that.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I bet the system is hacked already.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
You're actually kind of right on that.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Yeah.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
But, I mean, come on.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
That was a Captain Obvious thing to say.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
I bet their online service is shit.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Well, I was wrong because it hasn't come out yet.

15:20.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah, I think that we need to do, like, our favorite three games of last year and then our predictions.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Sure.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Yeah, so let's do it that way.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
No less than two Wii U remakes announced at E3.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
Not at E3, but we got Bayonetta 2.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Technically, yes.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
So technically there's Bayonetta.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
Do we get any other remake announcements at E3?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
There's been a lot of games that have been ported to the Switch.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I don't think those are remakes necessarily, though.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Yeah, no.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
So you got one.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
You got one or two.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
And no F-Zero.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Well, that was, again, Captain Obvious thing to make.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
All right.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Let's pass them on to Jamie.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Let's make her do a few.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
It's almost like you had all this pent up rage for no reason for Nintendo.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
I know.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
All right.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Oh, Pokken.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Thank you, Act F.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Thank you, Act F.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Pokken was E3.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Oh.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Thank you, Act F.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Pokken is Pokken 2.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
This was me.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Sort of.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
I guess these were the games I've been playing.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Okay.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
So I said World of Warcraft Legion, which I've played through part of the year.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
But then you've since stopped.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
And now I'm playing it.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Danganronpa 2.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Okay.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Which I still haven't finished.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
And Breath of the Wild.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Okay.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Which you're kind of still, you have the DLC, right?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
You and Dan have been kind of Pokken your way through that, right?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Yeah.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
So I started on my Switch version.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Okay.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
So.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
And then there's a few in here.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Okay.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
This one's Rob's.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
I guess it's what you're playing.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Final Fantasy XIV.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Overwatch with Alan.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
And overcome with feelings about Andromeda PS.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Was the gay sex good?

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
Unfortunately, no, it was not until they patched in the JAWS stuff, I guess.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
That's when you finally got.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
So Rob, the answer is no, it wasn't very good.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Okay.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
There's only a few more left in here.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I think there's three more in here, so we'll each pull one.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
All right.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
This one says.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
This is a huge list.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
JD's initials are on this too.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Oh, this might've come from chat.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Okay.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
I don't even know what the hell.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Was he here during the time that we were recording?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
I think this is from chat because there's a Dungeon Buster thing on here.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Oh, okay.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
So I think this is Jamie's handwriting and she wrote six things here.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Virtual Console, Jamie.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Well, didn't happen.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
We'll put that on 2018's list.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Augmented Reality, Jamie.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
Actually, there's been a lot of talk of it from Apple.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
From the developer's conference.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
I mean, that's a really broad category.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
So, you know, did we get HoloLens?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Not beyond the developer stuff.

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
But, you know, Pokemon Go incorporated AR even further into what they're doing on the phones.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
So, you know, that's something.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
JD put Mii support.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
M-I-I support.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
Well, you sort of can use the Miis on the Switch.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Your little avatars are Mii people.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Yeah.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
All right.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Let's see.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Two months to Linux, said Jamie.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Oh, that must have been about the Switch.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Two months to Linux.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Which I don't think has happened.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
No, it has not happened.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
But they're getting close.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Stream plus video clips.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Jamie, again, I think that's about the Switch.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Also hasn't happened.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Well, no.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Video clips did.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
So stream didn't.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Video clips did.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
So half point there.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
But this is like whose line is it anyway?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
The points don't matter.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
And then Dungeon Buster said EA and Ubisoft still committed.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Oh, that's a good one.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
So are EA and Ubisoft still committed to the Switch?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Well, I think Ubisoft's a big yes.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Definitely, yes.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Definitely.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I mean, with Mario Rabbids was one of their big titles last year.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
EA hasn't really done much other than their sports games, but we don't know for 2018 yet.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
I feel like EA's kind of being bullied into it, which is fine.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Oh, something bad happening to EA.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Oh, that's just terrible.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
All right.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
I think there's only a couple left in here.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
So, Loki, you can grab one.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
We have to be more specific this time.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
We're learning as we do this here at Orange Planet Radio.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
And you can join us and chat at live.vognetwork.com.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I have no idea.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
You wrote this one.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Me?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
I think.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
It says, did 45 get impeached?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I don't know.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
No, I probably wrote that too.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Why do we put things forward about games?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
I have no idea.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
No, he did not.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
No, he did not.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Damn shame.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
But there's a book out, I mean, for what it's worth.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
I'm not surprised at all.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I have listened to half that book.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
It's pretty good.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I obtained it.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
All right.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
One more for Dark Soccer.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
One more for Dark Soccer.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Yeah, there's a couple more in there.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
I'll finish them up.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
All right.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
What I'm going to do for us is I think we do one of our game prediction, our games that

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
we're playing, and then we take a few things from the chat room.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Oh, Bobby in chat says, you must have listened to the show this week.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
Bobby says, you put that one in at the very end as a secret to everyone.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
You showed it to Jamie and she laughed, but you wouldn't read it to chat.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Oh, well, there you go.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Surprise.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Okay.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Okay.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I can't read your handwriting, Rob.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
All right.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Then I'll do this one.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
All right.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
My handwriting says, did they bundle one to switch in yet?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
No.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
They didn't have to.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
And this one's also your.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
That didn't work out so well, did it?

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Well, they didn't.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
GameStop did.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
Can we play virtual console online like they said on the website?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Nope.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
Well, it seems headed that direction, but nope.

20:52.000 --> 20:58.000
If by you mean virtual console, you mean illegally emulated games online, then yes, you can play

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
those online.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
All right.

21:01.000 --> 21:07.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, JD in chat said, yeah, and it went on sale

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
for a bunch for Black Friday, talking about one to switch.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
So that's something there.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
I literally forgot about one to switch until it was just brought up just now.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
All right.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
So chatters over at live.vognetwork.com, what should we put in?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
So time capsule's empty right now.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Okay.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
So what goes in the time capsule for this year?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
So we're supposed to put our top three games, right?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Because I didn't even put that in there yet.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Yeah.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
So why don't you guys start.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Well, okay.

21:34.000 --> 21:43.000
So my top three games for 2017 are Animal Crossing Pocket Camp, Danganronpa V3, and

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Mass Effect Andromeda.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
I really have nothing else.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
So.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
All right.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
They're going in.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Put it in there.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
All right.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
And, and Loki, did you, did you even think of three games?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I was kind of put on the spot.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Don't do like a huge sheet of paper so we can get everything to fit.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Oh, okay.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
We'll all rip these apart.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
So that's fine.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
It's fine.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
I've got more than three actually.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
So go for it.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Um, just the completely obvious safe answer.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
The AAA gaming industry will continue to fuck up games using, we're doing our top three

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
games.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
Oh, well that's still a game because it's the industry fucking thing as well.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
And my top three games of this year.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Um, Loki's like, I didn't understand the assignment.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
I wasn't listening.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
I was writing, um, top three games of this year.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
That's a tough one.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Cause I didn't play much.

22:29.000 --> 22:40.000
Um, I would probably say, uh, South Park, um, the Fractured But Whole and then, uh,

22:40.000 --> 22:51.000
still Skyrim remastered and um, gosh, I don't know.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Like I really didn't play that much.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
Um, I have no idea.

22:57.000 --> 23:05.000
I'm just going to put two and the AAA industry fucking over everything as my game number

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
three.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Well, that's a given captain obvious.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
All right.

23:08.000 --> 23:16.000
I'm going to put in my list here and I kind of had to, sorry, I kind of had to do this

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
fast and I didn't really think analytically about this.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Um, but I put number one, Super Mario Odyssey, that's a given.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
I put number two, Breath of the Wild and I went ahead and put number three, Final Fantasy

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
14, Stormblood.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
I mean, I know that's kind of obvious for me, but I really liked the story and the expansion.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
Like seriously, I know a lot of people haven't really enjoyed it, but the story and the expansion

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
is so good.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I like better than some of the mainline Final Fantasy games.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
So that's just kind of what came to mind.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
And obviously a game I played an awful lot this year.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
So I'll go ahead and put that in there.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Don't forget chatters.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
We want your suggestions over at live.vognetwork.com.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
Uh, Bobby black will suggest put time to car is number three cause you've played it and

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
we have it.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
So that is true.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
I have accepted.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
It's not really played label your thing.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Didn't you Rob?

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Yes, I did.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Okay.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
I put 2017 top three.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Okay.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Okay.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
So let's start with some of these other slips here.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Okay.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
So, um, I have to kind of rip this one up funny.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
All right.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Here's my prediction or one of my predictions.

24:15.000 --> 24:23.300
2018 will Microsoft jealous of Nintendo's sales this holiday, Jack the switch concept,

24:23.300 --> 24:27.680
but for PC as well, the Nvidia shield is already halfway there.

24:27.680 --> 24:28.680
After all.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.680
I wrote a lot on that.

24:29.680 --> 24:30.680
Sorry.

24:30.680 --> 24:35.920
So at the end of the day, I'm asking will Microsoft jealous of the switches success,

24:35.920 --> 24:42.480
Jack, the concept for themselves, the reason I think that will not to say that I couldn't

24:42.480 --> 24:45.800
do that, but they have, wouldn't be the first time they've taken a good idea, but they have

24:45.800 --> 24:48.720
a tablet device pretty much already with their surface tablets.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.720
True.

24:49.720 --> 24:54.000
So they'd probably try to push that as a gaming platform versus, you know, cause you can do

24:54.000 --> 24:58.120
X-Box anywhere type stuff, but yeah, it would be nice if another company did that.

24:58.120 --> 25:00.400
All right, Jamie, how about one for you?

25:01.160 --> 25:03.000
I didn't do them as like questions.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.640
I just did one more third party switch support like SNK, Konami, et cetera.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.040
So will we see more switch third party support?

25:10.040 --> 25:11.040
Yeah.

25:11.040 --> 25:12.040
I like that.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.520
Because it's really not super heavy right now.

25:13.520 --> 25:17.880
And we actually have some rumors tonight about Konami possibly stepping it up even more with

25:17.880 --> 25:18.880
switch.

25:18.880 --> 25:23.920
So number two, Konami learns from Capcom and listens to fans because, you know, Capcom

25:23.920 --> 25:25.640
is doing Mega Man 11.

25:25.640 --> 25:26.640
True.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.640
So true.

25:27.880 --> 25:31.880
And number three, I will continue to be very disappointed by the gaming industry as a whole.

25:34.880 --> 25:35.880
All right.

25:35.880 --> 25:36.880
Loki.

25:36.880 --> 25:44.000
Aside from the one I already mentioned, I said the X-Box One X and PlayStation 4 Plus

25:44.000 --> 25:45.840
don't sell well.

25:45.840 --> 25:46.840
Okay.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.840
That we'll see new...

25:48.840 --> 25:52.440
Don't you think it's a little late for the PS4 Plus prediction?

25:52.440 --> 25:53.840
Cause that was last year.

25:53.840 --> 25:54.840
Was it?

25:54.840 --> 25:55.840
Yeah.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.120
It's been, that's been out a while.

25:57.600 --> 25:58.600
But it'll still continue not to sell well.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.080
I don't know if it's even selling well.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.080
I assume it's not because...

26:02.080 --> 26:03.080
Why?

26:03.080 --> 26:08.880
Well, I, I kind of think the Plus is just quietly taking the place as the default console,

26:08.880 --> 26:09.880
but...

26:09.880 --> 26:10.880
All right.

26:10.880 --> 26:11.880
No, I mean, it's fine.

26:11.880 --> 26:16.720
It's not like it's still didn't like, Oh, I got to have it because it's so amazing.

26:16.720 --> 26:22.680
I said that new second gen VR headsets this year.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.120
Okay.

26:24.120 --> 26:30.480
And the bold prediction, but maybe safe prediction, no Final Fantasy 7 remake and no Kingdom Hearts

26:30.480 --> 26:31.480
3 this year.

26:31.480 --> 26:34.040
Oh, so both those games not happening in 2018.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.040
Not happening.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.040
All right.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.040
That's the prediction.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.040
Oh, sorry.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.440
One last one.

26:39.440 --> 26:42.640
Nintendo will stop production of the 3DS and 2DS.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.640
Okay.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.160
Now those are some predictions, Loki.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.160
I like those.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.160
All right.

26:47.160 --> 26:50.160
So chat room, message me one prediction.

26:50.160 --> 26:55.600
I will take the top five and I will only take them via message, not said in the chat

26:55.600 --> 26:56.600
room.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.600
All right.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.600
Why is that?

26:58.600 --> 26:59.600
Because...

26:59.600 --> 27:00.600
That would be a surprise.

27:00.600 --> 27:01.600
Because I want people to fucking listen.

27:01.600 --> 27:02.600
All right.

27:02.600 --> 27:06.960
I still have more.

27:06.960 --> 27:10.740
I had one more that I wanted to put in there.

27:10.740 --> 27:14.880
The next prediction I said is, did Anthem flop?

27:14.880 --> 27:20.200
You know that we've had a lot of things to say about how EA handled Mass Effect.

27:20.200 --> 27:24.200
EA is further under the spotlight for this whole loot box thing.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.640
You know they've planned for Anthem to have loot boxes in one way or another.

27:27.640 --> 27:28.640
This game is already in development.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.800
Why not put them all in one form so that we don't have a bunch of little papers in there?

27:31.800 --> 27:33.800
Because I didn't think of it.

27:33.800 --> 27:34.800
Yeah.

27:34.800 --> 27:41.220
We need a project manager for the time capsule.

27:41.220 --> 27:42.360
So I put, did Anthem flop?

27:42.360 --> 27:45.240
Do I have to put my top three games on a piece of paper?

27:45.240 --> 27:46.240
Or did you already do that?

27:46.240 --> 27:47.240
One single piece of paper.

27:47.240 --> 27:48.240
Yeah.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.240
You can do it on one single piece of paper.

27:49.240 --> 27:50.240
All right.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.240
Stop sending me suggestions.

27:51.240 --> 27:52.240
I have more than enough.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.240
All right.

27:53.240 --> 27:56.440
Now I do like this suggestion from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.440
This is before you started saying something, Jamie.

27:59.440 --> 28:05.760
Bobby says, based on the games that you know are coming out in 2018, what do you think

28:05.760 --> 28:11.920
your top three will be when you open the time capsule next year?

28:11.920 --> 28:17.360
There's so many games they just don't announce until E3.

28:17.360 --> 28:18.360
That's hard.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.360
I can already name a few.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.360
Okay.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.760
Do you want to write them down and put at the top, um, were these my favorite games

28:23.760 --> 28:24.760
2018?

28:24.760 --> 28:25.760
Question mark.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.400
I'm out of paper, but yeah, sure.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.400
I should hear it.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.400
It's all good.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.400
It's all good.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.400
Hey everybody.

28:31.400 --> 28:36.060
I have to throw stuff away because you're terrible.

28:36.060 --> 28:38.880
So what, what games are you going to put on there, Loki?

28:38.880 --> 28:41.600
I'm going to put on the, well, we're going to get to it later.

28:41.600 --> 28:44.640
A certain remake of a certain racing game from a certain criterion.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.240
Um, fair enough.

28:46.240 --> 28:57.920
I am going to put red dead redemption two and, and number three is gonna be tough.

28:57.920 --> 29:03.440
I don't know, cause I don't know what other games are going to be coming out.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.640
I'm going to hope for a new elder scrolls game.

29:05.640 --> 29:06.640
That's never going to happen.

29:06.640 --> 29:10.760
Um, I'm going to put Metroid prime four.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.320
I think that's a gimme for me.

29:12.320 --> 29:15.440
So Metroid prime four, did I enjoy in 2018?

29:15.440 --> 29:23.080
Number two, I'm going to put, um, I think the Bayonetta remakes too easy because we

29:23.080 --> 29:24.780
know how those games are.

29:24.780 --> 29:34.000
So I'm going to, I'm going to be bold and say earth bound or no mother three because

29:34.000 --> 29:35.160
who knows what that is going to happen.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.160
Ooh, I know.

29:36.160 --> 29:43.440
Number three, I'm going to put secret of mana remaster.

29:43.440 --> 29:46.040
Secret of mana is on steam right now.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.040
Yeah.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.240
But you know, you know how they're doing that remaster.

29:49.240 --> 29:51.640
I think it's only about a month away on PS4.

29:51.640 --> 29:52.940
I'm really looking forward to that.

29:52.940 --> 29:57.920
So I'm going to, uh, I think it's also on steam to be fair, but I know PS4 is the console

29:57.920 --> 30:03.640
platform they're going with with that, uh, tiger claw and chat says sending me suggestions.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.160
I've got plenty.

30:05.160 --> 30:07.440
Tiger claw and chat says, what about F zero?

30:07.440 --> 30:11.040
Do you think 2018 will be the year for a new F zero on the switch?

30:11.040 --> 30:12.040
No, I do not.

30:12.040 --> 30:13.040
Sadly.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.700
And it pains me to say that, but no, I do not.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.720
So that's why I'm not putting that in.

30:16.720 --> 30:18.360
All right.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.360
What else is left?

30:19.360 --> 30:21.760
Jamie, do you want to read some of these chat things we're putting in?

30:21.760 --> 30:22.760
Not yet.

30:22.760 --> 30:27.320
I know the, another game that I could be looking forward to next or this year, um, which I

30:27.320 --> 30:29.400
hopefully it's going to be making its way out this year.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.680
I know that they're working on Borderlands three.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.280
There you go.

30:34.280 --> 30:35.280
I'd be done with that.

30:35.280 --> 30:36.280
There you go.

30:36.280 --> 30:37.280
That's a good one for your list.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.280
What about you guys in our chat over at live?

30:38.280 --> 30:39.520
I think that we should leave.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.160
I'm going to leave these five here.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.160
A secret.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.160
Oh, you're not even going to read them?

30:43.160 --> 30:44.160
Nope.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.440
Where's the fun in that?

30:45.440 --> 30:47.200
Because it's the fun.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.920
That means we have to make it through another year.

30:48.920 --> 30:49.920
All right.

30:49.920 --> 30:50.920
Did you put what chatters?

30:50.920 --> 30:51.920
Yes, I did.

30:51.920 --> 30:52.920
Okay.

30:52.920 --> 30:53.920
All right.

30:53.920 --> 30:57.000
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.600
Bobby says four is a horizon.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.760
Four is most likely coming because they pretty much verified that the four is a series as

31:01.760 --> 31:06.520
a yearly series splitting between motorsport and horizon in 2018 as a horizon year.

31:06.520 --> 31:07.520
Well, that's good to know.

31:07.520 --> 31:10.840
Um, that'll be really good on, that might be the game that finally pushes me to get

31:10.840 --> 31:11.840
an Xbox one X.

31:11.840 --> 31:12.840
We'll see.

31:12.840 --> 31:13.840
Um, tiger claw.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.400
Except you can just play it on PC.

31:15.400 --> 31:16.640
Yeah, I guess that's true.

31:16.640 --> 31:20.840
Tiger claw in chat says in 2018, I want to see a new Ninja Turtles game from Rocksteady.

31:20.840 --> 31:24.760
If Ninja Turtles is coming to injustice two, isn't the indication there's that.

31:24.760 --> 31:25.760
All right.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.080
Anything else for the time capsule?

31:28.080 --> 31:30.400
Now that Jamie has put in the chat room comments.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.400
All right.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.320
Going once, going twice.

31:34.320 --> 31:38.040
Do we need something that isn't related to gaming?

31:38.040 --> 31:39.920
Oh yes, no, I do.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.800
I want to put one thing that's very important and this actually ties into something we're

31:42.800 --> 31:44.280
going to talk about next week.

31:44.280 --> 31:45.280
Okay.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.440
Like maybe we should each put our one top secret social prediction.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.240
No, I'll read this one out loud.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.240
It's fine.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.320
Well, mine's going to be top secret because it's my prerogative.

31:54.320 --> 31:55.320
Okay.

31:55.320 --> 31:57.760
I'm writing.

31:57.760 --> 32:01.520
Did Rob finally rage quit ingress?

32:01.520 --> 32:08.280
I reached quit for a while, remember as Rob takes me around to like a portal on the way

32:08.280 --> 32:09.280
here.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.280
Yeah.

32:10.280 --> 32:11.280
Right.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.280
It was pretty cool though.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.280
Jamie, when you take a detour.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.280
All right.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.280
True.

32:15.280 --> 32:16.280
All right.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.280
And I put mine on gaming one, which is still sort of gaming.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.280
Ready?

32:18.280 --> 32:19.280
Player one didn't suck.

32:19.280 --> 32:22.320
All right.

32:22.320 --> 32:23.320
Anything else?

32:23.320 --> 32:24.320
Dark soccer.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.320
You go.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.320
Oh, you're keeping it a secret.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.320
Yeah.

32:27.880 --> 32:28.880
And then we'll seal it up.

32:28.880 --> 32:29.880
Where's the lid?

32:29.880 --> 32:30.880
Where's the lid?

32:30.880 --> 32:31.880
Oh, here.

32:31.880 --> 32:32.880
Here it is.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.880
Seal it a little way.

32:34.880 --> 32:38.000
Bury it underground where Mr. Smoosh won't find it.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
And there it is.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.800
All right.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.320
Going to chat over at livetopvognetwork.com.

32:48.320 --> 32:52.200
Azett just joined chat saying, no, he just sent me on an errand actually.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.200
And that's, that's about ingress.

32:54.200 --> 32:58.260
But I haven't rage quit yet.

32:58.260 --> 33:02.160
Today was pretty good, but I've had my days where I'm like, this is, this is it.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.160
I'm done.

33:03.160 --> 33:04.160
Yeah.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.160
I pulled it up this near this afternoon.

33:05.160 --> 33:06.160
I was like, Oh, Hey.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.160
Yeah.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.560
We had a little James Bond day today.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.560
It was fun.

33:09.560 --> 33:10.560
All right.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.020
Seal it up.

33:12.020 --> 33:15.880
By the way, next week is going to be a very ingress heavy show because if you've never

33:15.880 --> 33:17.280
played the game, that's okay.

33:17.280 --> 33:23.040
Because we're going to have some very fun ladies who really do a lot with the game and

33:23.040 --> 33:26.160
the community here in Sacramento are going to be here on the show next week.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.960
So it's kind of a, it's kind of a lady gamer takeover next week.

33:28.960 --> 33:29.960
It's going to be a lot of fun.

33:29.960 --> 33:30.960
Hell yeah.

33:30.960 --> 33:32.160
So tune in for that live.

33:32.160 --> 33:33.160
And Estrafest.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.160
Oh boy.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.160
All right.

33:35.160 --> 33:36.160
All right.

33:36.160 --> 33:38.280
Oh girl, as the case may be.

33:38.280 --> 33:43.800
Anyway, uh, let's, I'm looking to chat over at live.vognetwork.com just for a couple more

33:43.800 --> 33:44.800
here.

33:44.800 --> 33:51.360
Uh, Tiger Caw in chat says in 2018, uh, solo, a star Wars story was the best star Wars movie

33:51.360 --> 33:52.360
ever.

33:52.680 --> 33:53.680
That movie is going to be shit.

33:53.680 --> 33:54.680
I don't know.

33:54.680 --> 33:55.680
Let's see.

33:55.680 --> 33:58.480
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, I hope my 4k home theater I'm building is everything I want

33:58.480 --> 34:02.320
it to be and more had the builder here two days ago taking measurements.

34:02.320 --> 34:03.320
We'll see.

34:03.320 --> 34:04.320
We'll see.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.320
All right.

34:05.320 --> 34:10.100
The time capsule is locked away and we will open that up new year's next year, which means

34:10.100 --> 34:12.820
we basically committed to another year of OLR.

34:12.820 --> 34:14.280
So there you go.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.280
All right.

34:15.280 --> 34:18.440
Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this

34:18.440 --> 34:19.440
week.

34:19.440 --> 34:20.440
No predictions here.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.440
Just facts.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.920
I actually want to bring up something else real quick before you get to your gaming weeks,

34:23.920 --> 34:24.920
right?

34:24.920 --> 34:29.280
Um, well, not to be a big downer, um, although I've been all over my social media with it,

34:29.280 --> 34:39.000
but my, um, my stepdad who I actually like better than my real dad, um, died on Christmas

34:39.000 --> 34:44.600
Eve complications to a idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

34:44.600 --> 34:47.320
It means that your lungs filled with fibrous tissue and you can't breathe.

34:47.320 --> 34:53.600
And he was in Gainesville for his double lung transplant and died after the first day of

34:53.600 --> 34:55.600
testing.

34:55.600 --> 34:59.000
And so my mother has no job.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.400
Um, she has no income right now.

35:01.400 --> 35:07.060
She can't collect anything until she turned 60, which is 11 months away.

35:07.060 --> 35:12.620
So I've started a GoFundMe to try to help raise money for my mother to help her keep

35:12.620 --> 35:13.860
her head above water.

35:13.860 --> 35:17.740
You know, I've got, we've so far raised enough to give her a month of her rent.

35:17.740 --> 35:21.340
I would like to at least cover three months of rent for her.

35:21.340 --> 35:25.140
Um, and it's not just me saying, oh, everyone else give money.

35:25.140 --> 35:31.420
I've actually taken over about two or three of my mother's bills so that she at least

35:31.420 --> 35:37.500
can have, you know, her phone and her internet and basic, you know, pay for her car.

35:37.500 --> 35:38.500
I understand.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.780
This is you looking out for a parent in any way you possibly can.

35:41.780 --> 35:44.220
Like I don't think anybody can blame me for that.

35:44.220 --> 35:48.980
And so I'm even going to go out on a limb and I'm going to do something that's a lot

35:48.980 --> 35:51.940
of pride swallowing here.

35:51.940 --> 36:02.660
If I can either get one person to donate $500 or two people to do $250 or five people to

36:02.660 --> 36:03.660
do $100.

36:03.660 --> 36:10.940
And you have to say in the comment when you donate that it's for halo.

36:10.940 --> 36:17.020
This means that if I get that goal reached, I will do halo as classic game of the week.

36:17.020 --> 36:20.380
I'm completely said that during the time capsule thing.

36:20.380 --> 36:21.380
Dang it.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.820
Oh, did, did she finally do halo?

36:22.820 --> 36:23.820
Yeah.

36:23.820 --> 36:26.060
I will do halo as classic game of the week.

36:26.060 --> 36:32.860
And on top of that, I will talk at length about halo and halo.

36:32.860 --> 36:33.860
Go for gold.

36:33.860 --> 36:35.300
Yeah, I'll play halo that night.

36:35.300 --> 36:36.300
Awesome.

36:36.300 --> 36:39.180
But I'll have to do it over here cause I have the halo.

36:39.180 --> 36:40.260
We'll have to fudge it a little bit.

36:40.260 --> 36:42.140
I have the halo collection on Xbox one.

36:42.140 --> 36:47.820
I who have never played halo will play halo on stream.

36:47.820 --> 36:51.260
All right, good.

36:51.260 --> 36:57.100
And also I am planning on doing a marathon as soon as I've healed up a little bit more

36:57.100 --> 37:00.180
and I'm not going to do it during awesome games done quick because that's unfair to

37:00.180 --> 37:02.380
me and them.

37:02.380 --> 37:06.900
But I want to do a stream where basically you donate 20 bucks, you pick the game out

37:06.900 --> 37:09.300
of my collection that I play.

37:09.820 --> 37:12.020
Which unfortunately halo is not in the collection.

37:12.020 --> 37:13.020
So it does have to be something.

37:13.020 --> 37:15.660
It's in the collection, but I'm going to do like per system.

37:15.660 --> 37:16.660
Okay.

37:16.660 --> 37:21.100
Like, you know, you, if you want me to switch systems, then you know, a little bit more

37:21.100 --> 37:22.100
of a donation.

37:22.100 --> 37:23.420
I'm just saying no cheating on the halo thing.

37:23.420 --> 37:28.140
No, no, but, um, but that means I have to get the thing hooked up to the CRT so that

37:28.140 --> 37:31.020
I don't have weird lag playing the guardian legend or something.

37:31.020 --> 37:32.020
All right.

37:32.020 --> 37:36.140
You know, and hey, if you want to donate more for a game I loathe, then fuck.

37:36.140 --> 37:37.140
All right.

37:37.140 --> 37:38.780
50 bucks for Zelda 2.

37:38.780 --> 37:41.740
You have somebody in chat saying right now I'm in for a hundred.

37:41.740 --> 37:42.740
Where's the link?

37:42.740 --> 37:43.740
All right.

37:43.740 --> 37:45.540
So the link is one down four to go.

37:45.540 --> 37:47.740
I'm going to post it in chat.

37:47.740 --> 37:48.740
Oh boy.

37:48.740 --> 37:50.020
I think she's going to have to do it.

37:50.020 --> 37:55.260
But what I'm doing right now is I'm even, let me actually get the link first cause um,

37:55.260 --> 38:00.260
but then I'm also going to put it on my Twitter, which is at dark Sakura.

38:00.260 --> 38:01.260
Okay.

38:01.260 --> 38:03.900
Um, but I will say it aloud.

38:03.900 --> 38:11.740
It's gofundme.com slash Michael dash mom is the link and I will put it in chat right

38:11.740 --> 38:12.740
now.

38:12.740 --> 38:16.500
And that's M I C H A E L cause I know there's a million different spellings of Michael out

38:16.500 --> 38:17.740
there.

38:17.740 --> 38:19.620
And oh, I definitely got it.

38:19.620 --> 38:25.500
But um, but just in the comments, you know, keep track cause you have friends and family

38:25.500 --> 38:26.500
and non OLR.

38:26.500 --> 38:31.020
But I would appreciate you leaving a word of encouragement to my mother cause she, it's

38:31.020 --> 38:37.300
two weeks today that Michael died and she's really in a lot of pain there by herself.

38:37.300 --> 38:41.120
She's had to go through all of this stuff cause he was a pack rat and she was even saying

38:41.120 --> 38:44.500
that she was putting stuff away and thinking, Michael's going to be pissed when he gets

38:44.500 --> 38:45.540
home.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.780
And then, you know, cause he's been in the hospital so much.

38:48.780 --> 38:56.300
So um, but even if you just want to give like five bucks or 10 or you know, whatever, every

38:56.300 --> 38:58.100
little bit is going to help.

38:58.100 --> 39:01.180
And if we can get my mom at least three months of rent, that should be enough time for her

39:01.180 --> 39:02.180
to find some work.

39:02.180 --> 39:03.180
All right.

39:03.180 --> 39:04.180
Well, good luck to you in that.

39:04.180 --> 39:05.180
Thank you.

39:05.180 --> 39:07.260
I know it's, I know that asking them for money is not always the most pleasant thing to do,

39:07.260 --> 39:10.740
but I think, you know, again, you are looking out for a parent and I think a lot of people

39:10.740 --> 39:12.140
in your situation would do the exact same thing.

39:12.140 --> 39:16.420
And on top of that, she's 3000 miles away, so there's not much I can do other than this.

39:16.420 --> 39:17.420
Right.

39:17.420 --> 39:18.420
Okay.

39:18.420 --> 39:24.380
So, um, but my mom, I told my mom I was going to do this and she, you know, she even said,

39:24.380 --> 39:26.860
thank y'all in advance for whatever you do.

39:26.860 --> 39:27.860
Yeah.

39:27.860 --> 39:28.860
That's my mom.

39:28.860 --> 39:31.860
I mean, we can probably call my mother and say, Hey, you know, you want to say something

39:31.860 --> 39:34.700
to everybody, but I'll ask her first.

39:34.700 --> 39:39.540
But yeah, but thank you guys for, for everything that you're doing to help my mom out.

39:39.540 --> 39:40.900
We, we argue about stuff.

39:40.900 --> 39:46.220
We don't always see eye to eye, but she's my mama and she's a nice lady most of the

39:46.220 --> 39:47.220
time.

39:47.220 --> 39:49.220
So thank you guys.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.220
All right.

39:50.220 --> 39:52.980
Well, let's shift gears a little bit and talk about your gaming week.

39:52.980 --> 39:54.260
Do you want me to have you go first?

39:54.260 --> 39:55.740
Do you want me to kick it to Loki so you can?

39:55.740 --> 39:59.660
I can go first and I'll put that, I'll let everyone know when I posted on Twitter.

39:59.660 --> 40:07.660
Um, but I'll be honest, I've been in a lot of pain, so I didn't really play a whole lot,

40:07.660 --> 40:12.700
but um, I did play some Dragon Age Inquisition just because it's kind of like, it's kind

40:12.700 --> 40:16.060
of comfort food for me is playing Dragon Age.

40:16.060 --> 40:17.060
Sure.

40:17.060 --> 40:23.980
And, um, yeah, and a little bit of Danganronpa V3, although I, I lost my progress.

40:23.980 --> 40:32.100
Um, holy shit, Raginator, if I can get to $2,500 during the Halo segment, I will say

40:32.100 --> 40:34.540
that Halo is my, I'll lie.

40:34.540 --> 40:35.540
Sure.

40:35.540 --> 40:36.540
2,500 bucks.

40:36.540 --> 40:39.420
I'll say that Halo is my favorite game and it's the greatest game ever.

40:39.420 --> 40:41.780
How much to sell her soul, $2,500.

40:41.780 --> 40:45.100
And then I'll also say it's a fucking lie, but I'm saying it for money.

40:45.100 --> 40:46.100
All right.

40:46.100 --> 40:47.700
Anyway, let's, let's get back to games.

40:47.700 --> 40:48.700
Yeah.

40:48.700 --> 40:49.700
Yeah.

40:49.700 --> 40:53.780
And also, but by the way, anyone who does donate something, I also will give you a personalized

40:53.780 --> 40:55.860
thank you on my social media.

40:55.860 --> 40:56.860
That's nice.

40:56.860 --> 41:01.620
So, um, but yeah, so, um, we started Breath of the Wild together again on Switch.

41:01.620 --> 41:03.340
Like starting, Oh, starting over with Switch.

41:03.340 --> 41:08.620
And Dan also started the, the trial of the Master Sword and then was like, fuck this.

41:08.620 --> 41:11.100
It is some bullshit, you know?

41:11.100 --> 41:18.700
Um, so we've been, we've been getting our Switch gaming on cause mostly, and I mean

41:18.700 --> 41:24.580
with the type of surgery I had, I have to lay out kinda, thank you already, by the way,

41:24.580 --> 41:25.580
first donation came in.

41:25.580 --> 41:32.260
Um, but, uh, I, I have to lay kind of flat sometimes because of my, where I was operated

41:32.260 --> 41:34.160
on hurts a lot.

41:34.160 --> 41:40.500
And so, um, Dan will play, uh, play Zelda and I'll be his navigator.

41:40.500 --> 41:44.400
And so we'll do the puzzles together and things like that and look for things that we missed

41:44.400 --> 41:48.180
and try to find, you know, stuff that he didn't find on the Wii U version.

41:48.180 --> 41:53.700
And then, um, we've been watching a lot of, um, uh, what's his name from Game Sack, The

41:53.700 --> 41:55.740
Ginger Guy.

41:55.740 --> 42:01.180
Game Sack is one of my favorite, um, uh, video shows on YouTube right now, just for gaming

42:01.180 --> 42:02.180
really.

42:02.180 --> 42:06.800
In fact, I'd probably say that one and, um, Battle of the Ports are my two favorites right

42:06.800 --> 42:07.800
now.

42:07.800 --> 42:11.660
And I like, Did You Know Gaming and, uh, Beta64.

42:11.660 --> 42:12.660
Those are my big ones right now.

42:12.660 --> 42:14.660
Um, yeah, Dave, thank you.

42:14.660 --> 42:19.700
Um, but I've been watching, um, we've been watching some of his streams on, on YouTube,

42:19.700 --> 42:23.420
just the, the recorded streams and been pretty fun.

42:23.420 --> 42:29.740
And, um, you know, kind of got me thinking about going back and playing some other older

42:29.740 --> 42:30.740
games.

42:30.740 --> 42:32.100
I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing though.

42:32.100 --> 42:33.100
I'm almost level 52.

42:33.100 --> 42:36.380
You should go dig up the GameCube and play the OG Animal Crossing.

42:36.380 --> 42:38.220
I loaded that up on an emulator.

42:38.220 --> 42:39.220
Okay.

42:39.220 --> 42:43.060
Because I was going to do my little web comic using that and it's easier to screen cap in

42:43.060 --> 42:44.360
the emulator.

42:44.360 --> 42:49.520
But I could just do the, the double finger screen cap and I'll start a new game on Dan's

42:49.520 --> 42:51.760
DS cause he's not using it.

42:51.760 --> 42:52.760
Okay.

42:52.760 --> 42:58.660
So, um, but yeah, it's, it's really, of course, Ingress today.

42:58.660 --> 42:59.660
Thank you, Rob.

42:59.660 --> 43:00.660
You're welcome.

43:00.660 --> 43:01.660
And a little bit of Miitomo.

43:01.660 --> 43:07.480
I'm kind of getting out of it now, but I like the outfits, excuse me, I've got hiccups.

43:07.480 --> 43:10.240
Um, I played something else.

43:10.240 --> 43:11.240
Oh yeah.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.560
And I'm, I'm actually buying Hollow Knight tonight.

43:13.560 --> 43:18.520
After having watched that speedrun, the game looks so fun and pretty that I think I need

43:18.520 --> 43:19.520
that game in my life.

43:19.520 --> 43:20.520
So, all right.

43:20.520 --> 43:21.520
There it is.

43:21.520 --> 43:22.520
Yeah.

43:22.520 --> 43:24.520
Derek Socrates gaming week.

43:24.520 --> 43:25.520
How about Loki?

43:25.520 --> 43:26.520
How was your gaming week?

43:26.520 --> 43:28.440
I finally got around to playing VR games.

43:28.440 --> 43:29.440
Awesome.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.440
VR game.

43:30.440 --> 43:31.440
I should say it's something.

43:31.440 --> 43:35.800
I played a super hot VR on the PlayStation VR and it's fun.

43:35.800 --> 43:36.800
I like it.

43:36.800 --> 43:41.560
The only issue I have with it, it's really just the PlayStation VR hardware, um, or I

43:41.560 --> 43:43.880
shouldn't even say it's a PlayStation VR hardware.

43:43.880 --> 43:47.960
It's more of the shitty ass PlayStation move controllers.

43:47.960 --> 43:54.560
Um, throwing things seem to be very difficult to get accurate.

43:54.560 --> 44:00.040
So like I try to throw, cause I know you can do it sometimes where you throw your gun from

44:00.040 --> 44:04.960
one scene to the next scene, because if you haven't played the game, um, once you kill

44:04.960 --> 44:09.340
all the, you know, the targets in the first part, it kind of teleports you to another

44:09.340 --> 44:13.780
section of the stage and sometimes you can throw your gun that you have from one section

44:13.780 --> 44:19.940
to the next section or like throw like a, you know, ball or ninja star or something

44:19.940 --> 44:23.460
like that down where you think a person's going to be and then you'll hit them.

44:23.460 --> 44:28.020
Um, so I tried doing that, but half the time when I went to throw something, it would just

44:28.020 --> 44:31.820
kind of, it'd be like, there's no energy behind it.

44:31.820 --> 44:35.880
I'd like, I'd throw it and it just kind of like falls down.

44:35.880 --> 44:39.300
Like there's just none of the momentum there and other times it would work fine.

44:39.300 --> 44:41.820
Or it worked fine in the completely wrong directions.

44:41.820 --> 44:45.260
I'd throw it and it bounced off of nothing and just somehow go behind me.

44:45.260 --> 44:48.060
I'm like, okay, that's not helpful at all.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.060
But I had a lot of fun with it.

44:49.060 --> 44:50.660
So I do like the game.

44:50.660 --> 44:56.060
Um, I just wish the hardware worked better, but it's fun.

44:56.060 --> 44:57.060
It's just hard.

44:57.060 --> 45:00.620
Definitely very hard to play that because you're trying to look around to see where

45:00.620 --> 45:01.620
things are.

45:01.620 --> 45:05.020
But anytime you move your head, that's when everything's moving in the timeline.

45:05.020 --> 45:06.460
It's super hot for those who haven't played it.

45:06.460 --> 45:09.160
And I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with it.

45:09.160 --> 45:10.160
Everything stands still.

45:10.160 --> 45:14.880
If you're still, as soon as you move or do any action, everything in the time starts

45:14.880 --> 45:15.880
moving.

45:15.880 --> 45:16.880
So concept.

45:16.880 --> 45:17.880
Yeah.

45:17.880 --> 45:18.880
It's a neat concept.

45:18.880 --> 45:22.920
So playing that in VR, you know, trying to get, you know, an idea of your surroundings,

45:22.920 --> 45:27.300
you're moving your head and there's like things coming up on you and you fire a gun and everything's

45:27.300 --> 45:30.300
moving, you know, for a little bit.

45:30.300 --> 45:36.160
And so it's just, it's difficult in a fun way, I guess I kept trying to make sure it

45:36.160 --> 45:37.160
wasn't hitting my TV.

45:37.160 --> 45:42.800
But yeah, so I'm going to definitely dive into more VR stuff, but I was, you know, happy

45:42.800 --> 45:45.480
to get to do that.

45:45.480 --> 45:49.280
Play another game, which I unfortunately can't really give an impression on till later on.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.980
So we'll just say it was hard.

45:51.980 --> 45:55.320
And then I played just the usual cell phone stuff.

45:55.320 --> 45:58.380
I've been playing a little bit of Ingress, a little bit of Pokemon Go, just kind of wherever

45:58.380 --> 46:03.640
I'm at, you know, if it's a restaurant or, you know, the grocery store or something like

46:03.640 --> 46:05.640
that, just hitting whatever's nearby.

46:05.640 --> 46:07.600
That's about it.

46:07.600 --> 46:08.600
Cool.

46:08.600 --> 46:14.400
My gaming week, I have been playing World of Warcraft Legion still.

46:14.400 --> 46:17.840
That's kind of my zen game right now, which is weird because I'm not very social in that

46:17.840 --> 46:18.840
game.

46:18.840 --> 46:23.280
I'm not really playing with anybody that I know, I kind of as a loner, I mean, some rando

46:23.280 --> 46:28.480
guild picked me up and whatever, I just, I don't really do anything but steal the perks.

46:28.480 --> 46:33.460
I leveled a druid on Horde side from one to 110 in the past couple of weeks.

46:34.180 --> 46:37.540
And I've just been exploring some of the newer content they put in there, like the Argus

46:37.540 --> 46:39.020
stuff and, you know, trying to catch up.

46:39.020 --> 46:40.560
So it's kind of been interesting.

46:40.560 --> 46:46.140
And then I started a shaman on Alliance side because I'd never played a shaman.

46:46.140 --> 46:48.900
And I think my shaman is already up to level 38.

46:48.900 --> 46:53.220
So you know, it's been just kind of like my zen game lately, kind of been playing that.

46:53.220 --> 46:54.620
I did some streaming this weekend.

46:54.620 --> 46:59.100
I played Super Mario World and that was a really fun stream because I got really frustrated.

46:59.620 --> 47:03.780
My muscle memory kicked in in the weirdest places and I remembered how to get to the

47:03.780 --> 47:04.940
star world.

47:04.940 --> 47:10.380
And then with a little help from chat, I think I got to the cool world, special world where

47:10.380 --> 47:13.500
all the stages are named like cool, awesome, and whatever.

47:13.500 --> 47:18.180
And one of those stages like tubular or something like fucked me up, like it took me a long

47:18.180 --> 47:19.360
time to get through it.

47:19.360 --> 47:23.980
And so it was interesting because one of the chatters was like, this is the hardest stage.

47:23.980 --> 47:27.860
And I beat it on like the second try, but then another stage just like ended me.

47:27.860 --> 47:31.020
It was so, so awful, but it was a great, it was a great stream.

47:31.020 --> 47:33.740
So I should probably finish that on stream at some point.

47:33.740 --> 47:35.460
So that was fun.

47:35.460 --> 47:38.540
And then I don't know if this is the game you were thinking of Loki, but I actually

47:38.540 --> 47:40.940
asked the author if I could talk about it a little bit.

47:40.940 --> 47:42.040
And the answer is yes.

47:42.040 --> 47:48.060
So I played a little bit of, and we've talked about it on the show before, YYR is making

47:48.060 --> 47:51.140
a new game and it's called super multitasking.

47:51.140 --> 47:53.460
Now he's beta testing this game right now.

47:53.460 --> 47:56.940
So he has invited some people to beta test it, which I'm assuming Loki's one of them.

47:56.940 --> 47:57.940
And I'm one of them as well.

47:57.940 --> 48:00.500
We just can't, we can't stream it until it's all ready to go.

48:00.500 --> 48:06.380
Um, but he said we can talk about it a little bit and I, I, I'm telling you, there's a reason

48:06.380 --> 48:11.820
why I brought him onto the phone to yell at him and tell him to put this game out because

48:11.820 --> 48:13.340
it's, it's fun.

48:13.340 --> 48:19.840
Like it's, it's incredibly hard, but it's, I did not realize like how, and for, if you

48:19.840 --> 48:24.060
don't know what super multitasking is, it's basically the easiest way I can explain it.

48:24.060 --> 48:28.460
Imagine you're playing WarioWare four places at once.

48:28.460 --> 48:33.180
It's kind of what it is, kind, I'm oversimplifying it to tell you what it is, but it is the best

48:33.180 --> 48:34.180
way I could say.

48:34.180 --> 48:36.140
So you're playing like WarioWare four places at once.

48:36.140 --> 48:41.820
So like the average game, honestly, if I get to two minutes, I've done a great job.

48:41.820 --> 48:47.020
Like honestly, I was not, I was a little surprised at how fast the games go by, but that's actually

48:47.020 --> 48:51.780
kind of a good thing because I do this whole one more, one more hit, one more sec, come

48:51.780 --> 48:53.300
on, one more.

48:53.300 --> 48:57.460
And so like I ended up playing it for a good hour the other day, just trying to keep beat

48:57.460 --> 48:58.680
my score over and over.

48:58.680 --> 49:02.340
So I, I, I think YYR is onto a good thing here.

49:02.340 --> 49:03.340
Yeah.

49:03.340 --> 49:04.580
So I'm excited for him to release the game.

49:04.580 --> 49:06.620
So he did say he's looking for more people.

49:06.620 --> 49:11.540
If you want to hit him up on Twitter, YYR, is it YYR underscore or underscore YYR?

49:11.540 --> 49:13.540
I think it's YYR underscore.

49:13.540 --> 49:17.140
And you can also visit his website at yyrgames.com.

49:17.140 --> 49:23.260
So yeah, so super multi asking, I mean, what I played is mostly finished.

49:23.260 --> 49:26.300
There are some bugs, but he kind of like already knows about them.

49:26.300 --> 49:30.340
So, um, you know, he'll squash them and I'm sure the game will be out in a couple of months.

49:30.340 --> 49:31.340
So that's going to be exciting.

49:31.340 --> 49:34.160
Y'all got to support him when he puts that out because I'm really excited for him.

49:34.160 --> 49:35.160
So thank you.

49:35.160 --> 49:41.060
JD in chat says a YYR underscore and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I'm mad he made it

49:41.060 --> 49:46.340
himself because I was going to make it myself and reap all that sweet, sweet indie game

49:46.340 --> 49:47.340
cash.

49:47.340 --> 49:49.380
So there you go.

49:49.380 --> 49:50.500
So just an update.

49:51.420 --> 49:55.820
Thank you to people who donated, although I forgot to mention, I need your Twitter handles

49:55.820 --> 49:58.260
to give you the thank you.

49:58.260 --> 50:03.660
But my mother, she says, please don't call them too emotional, but she says, please thank

50:03.660 --> 50:04.660
them for me.

50:04.660 --> 50:05.900
She's overwhelmed.

50:05.900 --> 50:06.900
That's wonderful.

50:06.900 --> 50:07.900
So thank you everybody.

50:07.900 --> 50:08.900
Thanks everybody.

50:08.900 --> 50:09.900
Who's able to help.

50:09.900 --> 50:10.900
All right.

50:10.900 --> 50:15.300
Tiger Han chat says you think we would see super multitasking in an AGD queue someday.

50:15.300 --> 50:16.600
Imagine a speed run.

50:16.600 --> 50:19.700
I think there's a speed run mode in there.

50:19.900 --> 50:24.260
I don't know if it's something that can be speed run because that's kind of the point

50:24.260 --> 50:29.260
is how long can you go, but I think it would be a great tournament game and he did build

50:29.260 --> 50:31.220
a lot of that feature into it.

50:31.220 --> 50:34.580
So I'm really excited for YYR.

50:34.580 --> 50:36.380
Like I really hope this does good for him.

50:36.380 --> 50:42.780
I think the one thing he might hear when the game gets released is that there's not enough

50:42.780 --> 50:47.800
of the mini games because people are going to come from this place of WarioWare and so

50:47.800 --> 50:51.040
forth where they're used to like 120 games and all this stuff.

50:51.040 --> 50:54.920
But like considering YYR has basically done this himself, as far as I know, like I'm really

50:54.920 --> 50:56.720
impressed with what he does.

50:56.720 --> 51:00.800
And also I think it's worth pointing out that if there were that big of a variety, this

51:00.800 --> 51:02.520
game's already fucking hard.

51:02.520 --> 51:08.400
Like if there was even greater variety, I don't know that it would be doable.

51:08.400 --> 51:09.800
So we'll see.

51:09.800 --> 51:10.800
We'll see.

51:10.800 --> 51:14.160
But I mean, I think, I don't know what he's going to end up ultimately charging for it,

51:14.160 --> 51:17.640
but knowing him, he's, he's not going to overcharge for it.

51:17.640 --> 51:19.680
And I think, I think it's going to do very well for him.

51:19.680 --> 51:23.000
I planned the minute I can stream it, we're streaming it.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.160
I was going to say, it's a great streaming game.

51:25.160 --> 51:33.320
Like seriously, like I know I'm overhyping this a bit, but like PUBG, Minecraft, Five

51:33.320 --> 51:36.440
Nights, that shit came out of nowhere and took off on streaming.

51:36.440 --> 51:37.440
People like watching frustrating games.

51:37.440 --> 51:38.440
Look at getting over it.

51:38.440 --> 51:39.760
How popular that is with streamers.

51:39.760 --> 51:43.160
I'm telling you, he has a chance.

51:43.160 --> 51:46.740
It may not happen for him, but it might with the super multitasking.

51:46.740 --> 51:47.740
So we'll see.

51:47.740 --> 51:48.740
It's just got it.

51:48.740 --> 51:51.680
The right people have to see it and the right people have to play it.

51:51.680 --> 51:54.220
And it's going to happen because I think you're right.

51:54.220 --> 51:58.580
People like to see people get frustrated and I'm not even streaming right now.

51:58.580 --> 52:01.100
And I missed the fucking pong ball or something.

52:01.100 --> 52:02.100
And I screamed at the monitor.

52:02.100 --> 52:05.220
I was so mad because like I knew it was coming and I got so mad.

52:05.220 --> 52:09.380
Well, I started like doing it like where it's two and two I can manage and also a third

52:09.380 --> 52:10.380
one pops up.

52:10.380 --> 52:12.700
I'm like, I can't do this.

52:12.700 --> 52:13.700
That's too hard.

52:13.700 --> 52:14.700
All right.

52:14.700 --> 52:18.280
Jack Wolfenchat says he needs to add Twitch API stuff where the chat can throw in which

52:18.280 --> 52:19.280
mini games show up.

52:19.280 --> 52:22.820
Ooh, that's a really good, I mean, I think at this point he's too far along where he's

52:22.820 --> 52:27.300
not going to add anything major, but he'll, he's, you know, especially if people really

52:27.300 --> 52:30.420
take to the game, I think he's the type of guy that's going to be like, all right, what

52:30.420 --> 52:37.800
can I do for super duper multitasking or super multitasking turbo tournament edition, super

52:37.800 --> 52:39.900
third strike.

52:39.900 --> 52:40.900
So anyway.

52:40.900 --> 52:41.900
All right.

52:41.900 --> 52:42.900
Good luck to YYR.

52:42.900 --> 52:44.160
Nothing but great things about your game.

52:44.160 --> 52:47.360
And I'm really excited to stream it, even though I'm going to be screaming a lot.

52:47.360 --> 52:48.360
All right.

52:48.360 --> 52:51.440
Um, for everybody else, it will be on steam eventually.

52:51.440 --> 52:52.440
So keep an eye out.

52:52.440 --> 52:54.520
I think there's a, because it was greenlit.

52:54.520 --> 52:57.940
So I think there is a page already on steam where you can kind of follow it.

52:57.940 --> 53:02.320
So you can go over there and check that out and then you can just follow YYR on Twitter

53:02.320 --> 53:03.320
and all that stuff too.

53:03.320 --> 53:05.040
And they don't have to go through the greenlight process anymore anyways.

53:05.040 --> 53:06.040
So yeah.

53:06.040 --> 53:07.760
Um, Oh yeah.

53:07.760 --> 53:12.120
Bobby Lockwolf points out multitasking one was on Xbox live indie games.

53:12.120 --> 53:13.120
That's right.

53:13.120 --> 53:15.660
And he put it out just in time for the cutoff there.

53:15.660 --> 53:18.020
And that's why this is super multitasking.

53:18.020 --> 53:21.140
And I think he bumped it up from 12 games to 17 or something like that.

53:21.140 --> 53:23.720
So he has already added new stuff into it.

53:23.720 --> 53:28.000
So, but for many people, I mean, I think so many people miss the boat on the Xbox indie

53:28.000 --> 53:31.360
games, especially as it was already being sunsetted and on the way out the door.

53:31.360 --> 53:33.640
Anyway, I think this is going to be where most people find it.

53:33.640 --> 53:36.580
So, all right, let us move on.

53:36.580 --> 53:38.600
We need to get into some gaming news as well.

53:38.600 --> 53:42.620
I don't have a lot of announcements here for housekeeping because as far as I know, we

53:42.620 --> 53:45.220
have shows pretty much coming up through the next few weeks.

53:45.220 --> 53:48.140
I'll be gone for a weekend in March, but that's over two months away.

53:48.140 --> 53:51.500
So we'll, I'm going to drag con in May.

53:51.500 --> 53:52.500
Are you going to drag con?

53:52.500 --> 53:53.500
I'm going to drag con.

53:53.500 --> 53:54.500
Nice.

53:54.500 --> 53:55.500
I'm going to drag un-con again.

53:55.500 --> 53:59.540
Actually, I should give a shout out to magfest because I know a lot of our listeners were

53:59.540 --> 54:02.340
at magfest this weekend and I was, I was bummed.

54:02.340 --> 54:07.380
I mean, there was a lot of problems with the hotels and all that stuff this year, but it

54:07.380 --> 54:12.620
sounds like once people got to magfest this past weekend, everybody seemed to have a good

54:12.620 --> 54:15.460
time and a lot of the feedback I'm seeing is very positive.

54:15.460 --> 54:18.940
And I know there was some question marks with the whole fact the arcade game room was changing

54:18.940 --> 54:21.620
as many things, but it sounds like magfest went really well.

54:21.620 --> 54:23.420
So I was, I have to admit, I was a little jealous.

54:23.420 --> 54:24.700
I didn't make it out there this year.

54:24.700 --> 54:26.100
I mean, it is what it is.

54:26.100 --> 54:28.460
Y'all know why I couldn't be there this year.

54:28.460 --> 54:34.140
But I will hope that they work out some of their flaws so that I can come to magfest

54:34.140 --> 54:35.140
2019.

54:35.140 --> 54:37.100
I think that would be fantastic if that could be a thing.

54:37.100 --> 54:41.660
So yeah, just shout out to those of you that were magfest, I'm sorry I missed it this year.

54:41.660 --> 54:43.540
I was definitely sitting at home this weekend.

54:43.540 --> 54:47.660
Like, I would see Ziba or SSG100mad or some of the people I know, they're like posting

54:47.660 --> 54:51.900
pictures or whatever, and I just kind of do one of those, like, you know, not that I'm

54:51.900 --> 54:56.900
like mad, but I'm just like, oh, I should be there now and I'm not, you know, but it

54:56.900 --> 54:57.900
is what it is.

54:57.900 --> 55:03.940
I'll be at Dragun Con and I'll be at, what other cons am I going to be at this year?

55:03.940 --> 55:06.860
I'm trying to play.

55:06.860 --> 55:08.220
Hopefully they do a Gamer X this year.

55:08.220 --> 55:10.020
I'll definitely be in for that.

55:10.020 --> 55:11.140
And who knows what else?

55:11.140 --> 55:12.140
Stay tuned.

55:12.140 --> 55:13.140
All right.

55:13.140 --> 55:14.140
Let's get into some gaming news.

55:14.140 --> 55:15.140
Loki.

55:15.140 --> 55:16.140
All right.

55:16.140 --> 55:18.980
Um, so let's talk a little bit about the Nintendo Switch.

55:18.980 --> 55:25.180
So the Switch is the fastest home or selling home console in the US.

55:25.180 --> 55:30.180
So it's sold apparently 4.8 million years over 10 months.

55:30.180 --> 55:34.340
And this has already surpassed the mark that was set by the Switch, which sold 4 million

55:34.340 --> 55:37.820
units during that same timeframe.

55:37.820 --> 55:41.660
And I guess in December they announced that they had sold, uh, the 10 million units.

55:41.660 --> 55:47.780
So, or they were, um, in Nintendo announced that they were selling 10 million units worldwide.

55:47.780 --> 55:54.380
So 4.8 in the US and 10 million worldwide.

55:54.380 --> 55:58.420
So Loki, you know, I got to needle you on this a little bit because when, uh, it comes

55:58.420 --> 56:02.300
to being critical in Nintendo, you're usually, you know, one to speak up here on the show,

56:02.300 --> 56:06.260
although you also, to be fair, you give them props or props or do as well.

56:06.260 --> 56:11.700
I think you, you agree that Breath of the Wild is a fabulous game as is Mario Odyssey.

56:11.700 --> 56:15.460
I don't think anybody, nobody's going to try to tell you it's debating that.

56:15.460 --> 56:19.580
And I think a lot of our frustration when Nintendo comes from, Oh my God, there's these

56:19.580 --> 56:23.980
things that other people are already doing and they're not like, they're, they're online

56:23.980 --> 56:24.980
is so weird.

56:24.980 --> 56:28.020
And all this stuff is like, it's like that frustration of like, this could be better,

56:28.020 --> 56:29.020
but it's not.

56:29.020 --> 56:30.300
But here we are, Loki.

56:30.300 --> 56:33.140
Now these sales figures show doesn't matter.

56:33.140 --> 56:35.140
Like it doesn't matter.

56:35.140 --> 56:36.140
Yeah.

56:36.140 --> 56:37.140
What's up with that?

56:37.140 --> 56:39.020
How do you, how does this make you feel when you hear this?

56:39.020 --> 56:40.020
It's still disappointing though.

56:40.020 --> 56:42.060
Cause it really should matter.

56:42.060 --> 56:44.440
It's not that, you know, it doesn't matter.

56:44.440 --> 56:49.820
It's just, it's doing well regardless of they're online as well, but it could be doing even

56:49.820 --> 56:50.820
better.

56:50.820 --> 56:53.780
Well, just, there's no excuses at this point.

56:53.780 --> 56:56.260
I mean like how well does it are behind her?

56:56.260 --> 57:01.620
I got a needle a little further because does it show that maybe this stuff doesn't matter

57:01.620 --> 57:02.680
to a lot of people?

57:02.680 --> 57:06.860
Maybe online gaming doesn't matter to a lot of people, but it does though.

57:06.860 --> 57:07.860
It does.

57:07.860 --> 57:08.860
It does to me.

57:08.860 --> 57:10.340
No, it does.

57:10.340 --> 57:12.300
Because like Splatoon is a big game.

57:12.300 --> 57:17.740
So let's do two or like, you know, Mario Kart eight or when it comes out, smash brothers,

57:17.740 --> 57:21.100
if they're online is broken, that's going to hurt the game.

57:21.100 --> 57:26.060
But online is working for those games you mentioned now, but yeah, but like, where's

57:26.060 --> 57:28.960
the rest of the stuff that they promised?

57:28.960 --> 57:35.500
Like I get it that like, they're not great at online, but dude, come on, make an attempt.

57:35.500 --> 57:37.140
There's nothing.

57:37.140 --> 57:38.260
There's no online right now.

57:38.260 --> 57:41.700
There's no online service that they're, I mean, they have like the store and stuff,

57:41.700 --> 57:45.180
but it's like, it's even more bare bones than the last console.

57:45.180 --> 57:49.100
But Loki, I like, again, I'm not trying to be a Dick, but this story says it doesn't

57:49.100 --> 57:50.220
matter.

57:50.220 --> 57:55.840
It's sold more than any other system done.

57:55.840 --> 57:58.660
Because people wanted Mario games and they wanted all the games.

57:58.660 --> 57:59.660
What can I say?

57:59.660 --> 58:03.380
You know, if you put those on the other call, would you, would you agree, meet me halfway

58:03.380 --> 58:08.560
here and say that for the general populace out there, it Mario and Zelda is more important

58:08.560 --> 58:10.080
than online.

58:10.080 --> 58:11.120
Yes.

58:11.120 --> 58:15.580
For some people, Mario and Zelda is more important, but they're going to need to keep having those

58:15.580 --> 58:20.520
types of games because Mario and Zelda, they're going to get old after a while and you can

58:20.520 --> 58:22.080
only play Mario Odyssey so much.

58:22.080 --> 58:26.080
I mean, there's a lot of replayability there, but it's eventually you're going to hit the

58:26.080 --> 58:29.080
end of that game and it's like, well then what else do I play?

58:29.080 --> 58:34.160
So could there be, so maybe, and you know, maybe there is some method to the madness

58:34.160 --> 58:39.120
here where some of these features are like peeling back the layers of the onion.

58:39.120 --> 58:42.960
Like maybe this year, you know, the online, the full support with virtual console and

58:42.960 --> 58:45.140
all that, that's going to be the next layer we get.

58:45.140 --> 58:48.320
Or maybe finally freaking Netflix and all that other stuff.

58:48.320 --> 58:52.060
Although they did get Hulu, so that's already kind of starting a little bit, but maybe more

58:52.060 --> 58:57.540
of that, you know, and then it will peel back into, who knows, maybe a Switch deluxe, because

58:57.540 --> 59:02.900
you know, this is Nintendo, you know, this will not be the only version of Switch that

59:02.900 --> 59:05.740
there's going to be a Switch deluxe or a Switch 3D or so.

59:05.740 --> 59:06.740
I don't know.

59:06.740 --> 59:07.740
I'm making sure.

59:07.740 --> 59:10.660
There's just a lot of frustrating things with their design and like some of it's really

59:10.660 --> 59:12.860
good and some of it's really bad.

59:12.860 --> 59:16.900
Like the really good part, like this is the design of the console is pretty nice.

59:16.900 --> 59:20.260
The bad part, the storage on the console is pathetic.

59:20.940 --> 59:23.540
Go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

59:23.540 --> 59:27.380
We have a couple of people, we have an anonymous chatter 287 saying online gaming doesn't matter

59:27.380 --> 59:28.380
to me.

59:28.380 --> 59:30.180
Bobby says online gaming doesn't matter to me either.

59:30.180 --> 59:35.400
287 also says I stopped at Diablo 3 when it needed online activation.

59:35.400 --> 59:38.300
You know, interesting that you bring that up though about Diablo 3, because it does

59:38.300 --> 59:41.860
kind of go, you know, a lot of people were really ticked off about that and Blizzard

59:41.860 --> 59:43.340
really had to scale that back.

59:43.340 --> 59:49.020
Now the PC version still needs online activation, but Blizzard did ultimately release the PlayStation

59:49.020 --> 59:55.740
3, 4, Xbox, you know, comparative versions that don't require any online.

59:55.740 --> 01:00:00.100
And that's why people have like gold cheated the shit out of those games too, because they're

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.900
not online and people can kind of do that easier.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:02.900
Who gives a shit?

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.940
Who gives a shit if they gold cheat the shit out of the offline game?

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:09.500
Yeah, if it's offline and they're in their own little island, let them do whatever the

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.500
fuck they want.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:11.500
However they have fun with it.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.980
It's when you go in with other people and fuck up their games too, when they may not

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.680
want that, they may want a pure quote unquote game.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.680
That's when it's an issue.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:19.920
But I get what you're saying.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:25.080
But the problem is though, is if we let them just keep getting away with their online being

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.080
shitty, it's always going to be shitty and at some point it is going to matter.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:33.040
And that's, that's my problem is like, get with the times.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.080
All the other consoles are doing it just fine.

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.800
Why can't you be up there with them?

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:41.240
Fifth Dream in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Pokemon will sell so many switches.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.600
Well that's, that's true.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:47.440
I mean, they've got, we know Nintendo's got that coming this year when you ask, you know,

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.200
what are the big games on the Switch this year?

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.320
Maybe Metroid Prime.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:57.600
I mean, maybe this year, but we know Pokemon is probably the tentpole fall release.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.440
And so, and that's going to be huge for Nintendo.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.400
I mean, even, and I'm not, I'm not like, you know, Shane levels of Pokemon obsessed.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:11.800
Well Pokemon Go maybe, but, but you know, with Pokemon, uh, I'm so excited to check

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.040
out the Switch one because I think being able to play it on the TV, I think it is going

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040
to make a difference.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.680
And sit on the couch and chill and, you know, hunt shinies or whatever.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:26.320
I don't, I don't like gaming on the 3DS a lot unless I am in a situation, you know,

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:31.280
if I took more mass transit or I was in that situation where I would need that more often,

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.920
I think I would, but I don't.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.680
So anyway, you got a portable console.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.240
I do because there's always, because then the games will come out for it.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.240
Like how else would I play Samus Returns?

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.240
That's my only option right now.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.120
There's still, there are still a lot of good games that come out on 3DS.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.200
You're not talking about the Switch.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.200
Oh, what do you mean?

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.440
Oh, of course I bought the Switch.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:51.240
Yeah, because it's, it's a portable console basically.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.720
Yeah, it's both.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:53.720
Yeah.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.680
I know Nintendo says most people are playing it in portable mode, but I'm playing it way

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.120
more in TV mode.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:05.480
Although certainly I've had flights out back East, you know, and stuff this past couple,

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.840
you know, months where I do take the Switch and I played, I played Mario Odyssey on the

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.400
airplane not that long ago.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.480
So I mean, it happens.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.840
So anyway, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:22.160
Actdeft in chat says Pokemon and Smash will consolidate the Switch.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.440
You know, we never know.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:28.480
Bobby Blackwil says I'll probably get Dragon Quest 11 because of the dual view going back

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.040
to the 3DS XL and you know why he likes it there.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:37.080
287 in chat says this Pokemon on the Switch might be the one that brings me back to Pokemon

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.760
games since I bought the blue version ages ago.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:44.960
You know, and with all the Pokemon Go hype, you know, that brought a lot of people back

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.340
to the series that haven't played it in a long time.

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:53.120
And then, you know, just build on that now with the biggest system in America right now,

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.760
according to these sales numbers, getting Pokemon.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.760
That's going to also be huge.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.760
Well, yeah.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:01.780
And especially if some of these, you know, console manufacturers like Microsoft and Sony

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:06.240
don't put out like a really strong lineup for the fourth quarter, like throughout the

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.240
year.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.640
I mean, granted, Sony does have a lot of things in the pipe, it's just when is that going

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.520
to hit?

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.520
And same with Microsoft though, Microsoft has a lot of stuff I know is out there, but

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.840
like, I don't know when the hell any of that's coming out.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:23.680
Well, and again, that's why I'm really curious about is Microsoft potentially going to, or

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.800
anybody, I mean, this could be Sony too, going to try to see what's going on here with Nintendo

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:32.080
and they're just going to straight up, Jack, sorry guys, setting up something for the next

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:38.960
story, is are they just going to straight up like Jack the idea?

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:42.780
I think it's too early to straight up Jack the idea right now.

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:45.320
And I don't think that they're going to do another Vito.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:51.400
I would like to see a portable console from one of them, but what would it do?

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:56.720
I mean, when it comes to Sony, I think in a way they've lost my trust a little bit with

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.900
portable consoles because they put them out and then they didn't support them.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:06.040
So I would really want to hear some type of commitment from Sony that they have a four

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.360
year plan, a five year plan with their next portable.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.720
But the weird thing is I say all that yet I'm thinking in the back of my mind, but Japan,

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.020
it's still thriving.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:16.900
So it's one of those things where it's like, if I'm going to trust Sony with another portable

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:21.120
console, I want the commitment that they're going to stick with it and not abandon ship

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:24.120
after two years.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.120
But I also understand that sales drive everything.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.840
Even Nintendo probably had to abandon.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:29.840
I want it to be awesome.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.820
And I don't want them to do stupid experimental shit.

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.500
Like let's put a touch panel on the back of the fucking thing.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.500
Why?

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:37.500
Why did you do that?

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.500
That's dumb.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.140
All right, so we're going to move on here.

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:44.300
Speaking of Nintendo, I have some Nintendo rumors.

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:49.860
Look, I know not all you guys are into the rumor chat, but the way we envision this show

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:53.980
is that we all are sitting at the dinner table after playing games at the arcade and there's

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:57.580
always going to be inevitably somebody at the dinner table that says, hey, did you hear

01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.140
about that Nintendo is doing this?

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:03.980
So girl, hold your wig because I got some news for you.

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:04.980
Right.

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:05.980
That's right.

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:06.980
So let's get into a few rumors here.

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:10.500
Uh, and you would think I would think I should play Adele's like rumor has it or something.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.060
It's like an intro to this, but I think that's a little too obvious.

01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:22.620
So I'm going to go a little more deep cut here and they remember Lindsay Lohan when

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:23.620
she had a singing career.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:24.620
There you go.

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.540
I remember when she was talented.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:27.540
That's Bobby Black Wolf right there.

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.540
I'm sick of rumors starting.

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:33.980
This is the Bobby Black Wolf Anthem sung by Lindsay Lohan.

01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:38.780
All right, let's get to some rumors that have come out this week about Nintendo.

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:39.780
Okay.

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:40.780
Here's the big one.

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:46.060
There's a YouTube that showed up out there that was showing the supposed 5.0 firmware

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:48.420
for the Nintendo switch.

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.340
And uh, the, the video has since been removed.

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:56.020
Uh, some folks, the evidence, I guess, whatever shows that this is fake, but it was floating

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.020
around Twitter.

01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:00.060
However, one Twitter user made the case for why it's fake.

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:04.020
Big red end and a tweet says the system update lead is leak is fake.

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:09.240
The console has Mario Kart eight DX downloaded digitally, which takes up 6.8 gigs of space,

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:13.780
but only two gigs of system memory has taken up less than 3.2 gigs of the SD card storage

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:19.280
has taken up and only 0.9 gigabyte cloud of cloud storage is taken up.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:24.220
So in other words, the storage numbers gave it away basically that the video was a fake.

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:30.620
I felt the video was a fan based on the merit of, I, I, it was really this for me.

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:36.940
Did you see where like Hulu, crunchy roll, YouTube or whatever was Twitch was all like

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:40.060
in one little folder or something like that?

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:45.420
I just think that design is not what Nintendo is going to go with.

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.660
I think it's as simple as that.

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:49.660
I don't think they're going to consolidate on 3DS though.

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.660
What's that?

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:51.660
Don't they have folders on 3DS?

01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:53.660
They do, but they don't look like that.

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:54.980
They don't look at all like that.

01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:59.980
And so I don't think the miniature icons thing doesn't work for me.

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:02.240
That's not what Nintendo is going to do.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.600
Even if they go to folders, they're not going to show miniaturized versions of game artwork

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:10.660
or things like that, because that would include Nintendo's own game artwork, which I think

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.300
they want to show in a different light.

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:16.100
That's really as simple as it is for me.

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.740
So there you go.

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:21.300
So everybody in here pretty much thinks that's a fake.

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:27.980
And even those in chat, I think, are like, nah, I mean, Nintendo may do something with

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:32.540
new firmware, but that's, you know, as sure as the sun is going to rise and fall every

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.540
day.

01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:38.620
Anyway, let's talk about some other rumors and maybe these are more on the scale of,

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:41.580
well, maybe this could happen, but I'll see what you guys think of this.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:46.020
Technically the sun stays stationary and the earth moves.

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:48.020
Thank you for that bit of science, Dark Soccer.

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.020
I appreciate it.

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:50.020
All right.

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.020
Fucking science.

01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:54.420
Let's talk about Bayonetta 3 and Metroid Prime 4.

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.180
Well, we know those games are coming.

01:07:56.180 --> 01:08:01.340
Nintendo's confirmed them both, but apparently Nintendo Norway's site says that these games

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:06.100
are for this year, both Metroid Prime 4 and Bayonetta 3.

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:09.420
That is a little bit more surprising, I think, in the Bayonetta 3 department, because we

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:12.140
just found out that that exists.

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:13.300
So what do you guys think?

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:15.540
Bayonetta 3, could it actually happen this year?

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:16.540
It's a placeholder.

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.540
Yeah.

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:18.540
You think it's more a placeholder?

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:19.540
I think it's all placeholder.

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.540
Apparently it's from Nintendo's site.

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:25.220
Bayonetta 3, Metroid Prime 4, and Kirby Star Alleys, as well as many other games that we

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:26.780
will reveal during the year.

01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:29.420
We're looking forward to 2018, ba-da-ba-da-ba.

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:30.420
It's all placeholder.

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:31.420
We'll see.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:32.420
I think it could happen, though.

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:35.260
I don't see why Metroid Prime 4 isn't something for this year.

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.980
We have an entire year.

01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:37.980
It could happen.

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:38.980
Yeah, that's true.

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:39.980
All right.

01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:42.140
Uh, moving on.

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:44.700
One more thing, and this, oh, darn it.

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:45.700
That was the same story.

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:46.700
Uh-oh, that's bad.

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:49.180
Did I put the same link twice in there?

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:50.180
You must have.

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:51.820
Son of a gun.

01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:54.980
All right, well, there was another one in there.

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.800
Does anybody remember what the other Nintendo rumors were?

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.100
Let's see if I can find it here real quick.

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.100
I have one.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:04.780
Um, I'm quickly trying to find it here about, uh, oh, shucks.

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:05.780
Oh, well.

01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.780
Go ahead, DarkSakura.

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:08.780
What do you have for us?

01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:15.380
Well, there, um, is a, uh, a discussion that was set up, um, trying to actually find where

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:20.060
the location was, um, that, um, there's, oh.

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:28.420
The site is, uh, Ruisatera, and there is someone named John Harker, who, um, has had some pretty

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:35.400
accurate predictions, um, came in with saying that there is a Nintendo Direct scheduled

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:43.620
for the 11th, um, and that, um, they don't know, he doesn't know if the timing has changed,

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:53.340
but, um, it also was, uh, confirmed by another poster named Emily, who said that SNK has

01:09:53.340 --> 01:10:01.340
a Switch title also in development, and there was a discussion about these 18 Nintendo Switch

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:05.340
titles that popped up on Amazon yesterday.

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.660
Here's the thing, though.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:09.020
Nintendo's going to do a Direct eventually.

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:13.300
That's how they put out their news, and we only know the news through, what, like, March

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:14.300
or April.

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:17.260
They've still got to date that Kirby game, which we know is going to be summer and stuff,

01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:20.980
so they're going to do a Direct, but don't hold them to the 11th, and even, even in this

01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:24.460
whole thing, what, the guy said the 11th, but the timing may have changed.

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.260
I mean, that's, that's a...

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:31.620
And an EA employee leaked something about there being a Direct this month, too.

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:34.580
I'm sure there'll be a Direct this month, but just don't be disappointed if it's not

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:35.580
the 11th.

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:40.900
Yeah, so the thing, though, about the Mystery games is that if you type in, in parentheses,

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:46.460
Switch title, not parentheses, but in quotes, Switch title in Amazon search, it comes up

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:52.340
with Switch title 23, Switch title 24, with no name, and with price points on them.

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:53.340
One of them listed is $99.

01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.340
It's probably a collector's...

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:55.340
That's all place holder.

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.740
It could be a collector's edition of something, too.

01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:00.460
Yeah, but that means that we're probably getting some announcements soon.

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:01.460
I'm sure.

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:02.460
Yeah.

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:05.660
Maybe the $99 for the Kirby thing, and there's, like, a cute little plushy Kirby that comes

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:09.060
with it, and you know Act Deft is already going to Amazon now to put in the pre-order.

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.060
Maybe.

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:11.620
All right.

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:15.900
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Act Deft points out they always do a Direct

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:16.900
in January.

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:22.580
Yeah, but the cycle's a little off, because the Switch, I mean, that was a Direct, but

01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:23.580
it also wasn't.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.200
It was actually a press conference in Japan.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.700
They kind of did it direct style.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:27.700
Remember that?

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.420
Because they had the people on stage doing that little snapping thing that was really

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.420
cute.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.700
So they did that in January.

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:38.640
But I mean, again, this whole fact that Nintendo is just up and done, whatever the fuck they

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:45.440
feel like doing, they put out a console in March, and a lot of people at that time thought,

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:49.240
well, that's weird that they're doing it outside the holiday period, but they did that with

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.240
the 3DS too.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.940
They seem to be doing okay.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:56.560
So anyway, I found the other rumor thing that I was going to bring up, and this is actually

01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:01.540
kind of a, I think it's a big one, it has to do with Konami, which, you know, we used

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:06.400
to love a lot, and then they've fallen out of favor, and now they're probably trying

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.000
to come back and possibly through retro stuff.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.920
We know the Bomberman game probably did better than expected, and Konami, you know, for better

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:16.360
or for worse, has been supporting that pretty well with follow-up content.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:24.640
Well, apparently, some of the WiiWare Rebirth games are looking to come back on the Switch.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.400
That was Gradius Rebirth, Castlevania the Adventure Rebirth, and Contra Rebirth.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.800
Did you ever check these out on the Wii?

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.360
I played the Castlevania one.

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:35.980
It was basically the Game Boy game, but then they kind of redid it in a Super Nintendo

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:37.280
style and put it on the Wii.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.000
It sounds familiar, but I don't think I ever played them.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.760
And I don't think a lot of people did.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.800
You know, the WiiWare games kind of got flooded a little bit, and I'm not sure if everybody

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:50.640
kind of knew this was out there, so it wouldn't surprise me if they get a second chance, and

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:58.040
this is again one of those things where it's like, Konami could do this kinda easily, but

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.080
I don't know.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:02.440
But anyway, we'll see what happens with that.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:08.160
So, I mean, again, that's just somebody on, and I don't know what criteria this guy even

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.200
has rather than saying it's Konami rumor or whatever, but it would be kind of neat if

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.200
that did happen.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.200
Yeah.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:18.000
I think we'd like to see Konami, you know, again, Konami's one of those companies where

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.040
it's like, I do, I wanna root for them, but I wanna root for the old Konami, so maybe

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.520
I wanna see Konami kinda go back to their roots and do a lot of the stuff that works

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.000
for them and make some changes in how they run their business.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Yes.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.200
So, I mean, you know, I think that's about the nicest way I can put it.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:39.400
So all right, anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, uh, Konami?

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.400
Never heard of them.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.400
I saw their name on a slot machine.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:42.400
Yes.

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.400
Yes.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.760
Well, you know, that business will still, uh, will still do very well for them.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.760
All right.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.760
Loki, what do we have next?

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:48.760
All right.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:54.320
So kind of, um, going into the whole CES thing, um, which is gonna be actually starting I

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.320
think this week.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:59.760
CES, they're gonna be showing off, or at least teasing, that there's gonna be a new

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:06.200
Vive shown off, um, that a second generation Vive with a higher resolution screen is gonna

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.760
be something that you might see there.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:13.280
In fact, they have a little tease on Twitter saying, New Years, and it's all blurry, resolution,

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.720
and then 1-8-18, and, um, yeah.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:22.560
So I guess we'll see tomorrow that there's gonna be a new Vive or something.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:29.560
Well, I mean, you know, if they do new phones every year, why not upgrade the tech in the

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.560
VR every year?

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.560
It makes sense.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.560
I'm waiting.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.880
I'm on the fence waiting for, I hope that the price is right, because I think the Vive's

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.320
pretty expensive right now, but the tech's nice.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.580
Well, usually when new tech comes out, old tech gets cheaper.

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:45.600
So would you maybe jump in on the old tech, knowing it would drop the price?

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.400
I do want to jump in on something maybe this year.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:53.360
I have to see, like, the setup with the Vive and the whole room scale stuff is pretty large.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.920
I know that's, I think, a little bit more optional, but, like, I don't know.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.760
The Vive is, I mean, the reason why you have all that setup is that the accuracy is much

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.520
better on the Vive than probably anything else.

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.520
Yeah, I'm down with that.

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:08.800
It's just, you know, yeah, it'd be kind of crazy to set that up in my living room.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.960
Yeah, you're just like, what the fuck are you doing?

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:11.960
You're kids might take you to the...

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:12.960
You're trying to watch TV.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.960
Why are you walking in front of the TV?

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:14.960
That's true.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.440
I would have a problem with that here, too, because Mr. Smoosh would probably try to climb

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.440
one of the poles.

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.160
He's like punching people in the game and he's like, what are you doing?

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.160
Can I play that?

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:25.480
I'm like, you better step back because I don't want to hit you.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.360
Bobby Blackwolf making a new offer in chat.

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:30.720
I'll sell Loki my old Vive if they have a new Vive.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.720
But I want the new Vive.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:35.160
There's a way to do it.

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.000
That happens with phones sometimes, too.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.520
I'm getting the new one, so I'm selling my old one.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.520
Yeah.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:41.520
Yeah, there you go.

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.560
All right.

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:47.360
Let me talk about some New Year's messages from some of your favorite gaming companies,

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:54.680
including Squeenix, Yosuke Matsuda talked in a message here, posted a letter this week

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:59.360
that talked about, you know, I want to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and the content

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.360
industry is going through all these different changes, including VR, AR, MR, and so forth.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:09.340
So they mentioned in here, specifically, he's calling out VR, AR, and MR, and what's interesting

01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:12.720
is that he actually brings up the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games because those games

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.040
are happening, of course, in Tokyo this year.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:21.280
So Japan is trying to ramp up 5G infrastructure, so meaning there are more mobile networks

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.740
that provide constant connectivity and support massive data traffic at a low cost.

01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:29.580
So kind of saying like, you know, what could this do for mobile gaming?

01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:34.120
These technological advancements could result in new forums for creating content and new

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:35.120
business opportunities.

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:40.800
And then he goes into talking about a richer lineup of digital content platforms, mentioning

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:44.920
again smartphone shipments are in excess of 1.5 billion units.

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:49.880
He mentions the Nintendo Switch, which he called a major global success, selling more

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:54.720
than 10 million units worldwide, but then also called out the PlayStation 4 for selling

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:59.560
70 million units, and then the Xbox One for adding the Xbox One to its lineup, and then

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:02.360
didn't say anything about sales.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.720
I can't help but notice those things.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:08.280
I'm not trying to be rude to the Microsoft fans, it's just a little funny.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.280
All right.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:12.520
Anyway, so saying, you know, but he did say got off to a good start during the holiday

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:13.520
season.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.920
So there's nothing else, you know, Square Enix still recognizes that and seems to be

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:22.000
committed to those platforms, even if not necessarily in Japan.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.600
So while the consumer console game market has been solid in the West, it's struggling

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:30.700
in Japan, but we expect the Japanese market to gain significant vitality as it joins the

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.260
overall trend.

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:36.440
So kind of interesting, you know, he's just talking about that it's been good in 2018,

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.680
we're going to leverage the global acceleration of technological evolution as well as prevailing

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:45.320
market trends in order to provide high quality, high creative contents, so that we can bring

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.880
new amazement and fun to our customers the world over again, that's Yusuke Matsuda from

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.240
Square Enix.

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:54.200
So what do you guys think here and all that I mean, Square Enix really seems like they

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.320
still they're gonna have their fingers in every pot.

01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:02.200
They're gonna do mobile, they're doing the switch, you can still expect Xbox Ones and

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.440
PS4, you know, stuff.

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.440
Same same.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.160
It sounds like Square's kind of committed to everything.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.760
Well, I'm excited about AR stuff.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.840
I mean, that's why I got the the Pixel 2 because that was one of the phones that does support

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:17.120
some of that AR stuff, not that's a non-Apple phone.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.280
But I'm still waiting for something that's other than these AR stickers, which it's all

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.280
right.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.880
It's just kind of still lame, so early.

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:29.120
Well, on to a different 2018 message.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:34.280
This one was from Natsume, of course, the makers of Harvest Moon, which is adorable

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.280
little series.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:39.720
This was a letter from Hiro Mikawa, who's the president and CEO of Natsume.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:43.000
And of course, it did focus on Harvest Moon because that's that company's kind of bread

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
and butter.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.500
He starts by sharing a little bit of, you know, his memories with Harvest Moon, but

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:51.360
also pointing out that, you know, in celebration of Harvest Moon's 20th anniversary, we've

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.820
developed a new Harvest Moon title, Harvest Moon Light of Hope.

01:18:54.820 --> 01:19:00.560
It's the first Harvest Moon to be multi-platform PC, Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation 4.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:04.820
The PC version was released in November, and the Switch and the PS4 are going to be released

01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:05.820
early this year.

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:09.480
Then you just kind of continue to say thank you for the continued support.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:13.680
We have several other exciting titles coming this year, in addition to Harvest Moon Light

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.980
of Hope for Switch and PS4, so stay tuned.

01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:21.140
And they are committed to, quote, make everyone happy.

01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:22.880
That's their corporate mission.

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.980
Don't you just want to hug them?

01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:26.820
Natsume always had some of the cutest boosts at E3.

01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:29.020
That was the big inflatable cute cows and stuff.

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:32.820
So you can't help but just pinch their little cheeks and go, you're so damn adorable.

01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:33.820
All right.

01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:36.580
Are you going to play some new Harvest Moon, Dark Sakura?

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:38.760
I'm surprised that's a series you don't play anymore.

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:39.760
I didn't like it.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:40.760
That was never my thing.

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:41.760
Really?

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.760
It was always, you know, whose thing.

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:46.220
OK, fair enough.

01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:47.220
Let's see.

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:50.220
287 in chat says, Natsume for the win.

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:52.380
Fifth Dream in chat says Harvest Valley.

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.380
All right.

01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:55.660
You going to check out Harvest Moon?

01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:56.900
I'm going to check it out on Switch.

01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:57.900
It might be cute.

01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:59.620
I want to see what it looks like.

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:03.580
I still haven't played the other farming game.

01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:04.580
So many farming games.

01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:05.580
There's a lot of farming.

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.820
It's Farmville Simulator and Farming Simulator.

01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:08.820
Yes.

01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:14.820
I need a cross between like Farming Simulator and like with the romance options of Mass

01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:17.660
Effect or any BioWare game.

01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:19.420
I think we need to do that.

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:21.300
Call it barn life.

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.300
I'm down with that.

01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:23.300
That's fine.

01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:27.220
You actually did have that in World of Warcraft in a quest.

01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:28.220
I do remember that.

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:31.820
Well, they kind of and they really expanded on that in later expansions when you have

01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:35.380
like the garrison and now they kind of you don't really have the garrison anymore.

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:40.180
The Mr. Garrison, you have the allies that you send out.

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:44.380
It's kind of a similar thing, but it always makes me laugh to go back because that's always

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:49.580
why I want to do my level there for Alliance is because I love that whole stupid quest

01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:50.580
line.

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:51.580
I understand.

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:55.260
I took a great picture of Mr. Smoosh, by the way, which wow is going to be changing pretty

01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:58.540
significantly in the coming weeks whenever that patch rolls out because the leveling

01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:00.900
is going to change completely.

01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:06.140
You will be able to level one to 60 in any zone in the old world because the level scaling

01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:09.460
that they do, you know how the level scaling in Legion, you can kind of go from a hundred

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:12.000
to 110, like kind of however you want.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.500
They're doing that with old content.

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:20.460
And then what's going to happen is 70 to 90, no, sorry, 60 to 80 is going to be, you can

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:24.620
go to Northrend or you can go to Outland, pick which one you like more and stay there.

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.940
I think that's when I'm going to re up.

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:27.940
Yeah.

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:28.940
And a lot of people are looking at that.

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:33.780
Either that or I might just go ahead and do it while I'm recovering so I can get my, because

01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:39.940
I was already, I had just finished the Gul'dan raid, so it shouldn't take me too long to

01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:40.940
catch up.

01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:42.940
Well, let's move on.

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:43.940
You have a new story for us.

01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:44.940
It has nothing to do with wow.

01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:48.900
It has everything to do with Kylo Ren's abs.

01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:54.580
So there's already a mod for Star Wars Battlefront II that lets you play as Matt, the radar technician.

01:21:55.540 --> 01:22:01.140
Which if you don't know, Saturday Night Live did this thing where it was like the Undercover

01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:07.300
Bosses show or whatever it was, where he went incognito, where Kylo Ren went as Matt, the

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:12.820
radar technician to see what the employees on the Starkiller base thought of him.

01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:17.100
And then, you know, he came out as, you know, oh, it's me.

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.500
Oh, we knew it was you the whole time.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.940
Oh, great, whatever.

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:26.460
So, but he had like these old like 80s style, you know, glasses and, you know, a bad blonde

01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:27.460
wig.

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:32.140
So he is in Star Wars Battlefront II as a mod.

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:38.020
So yeah, don't force choke employees in the break room.

01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:41.180
And also, if you haven't seen that sketch, watch it because it's fucking hilarious.

01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:42.180
Okay.

01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:43.180
It is great.

01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:46.940
It was, Saturday Night Live is getting a little bit of its groove back.

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:47.940
A little bit.

01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:53.060
It's still as good as it was in the 90s or the 70s, but it's, you know, it's getting

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:54.060
its groove back.

01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:58.740
It's not as bad as it was either because it was pretty bad there for a while.

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.380
But that whole skit is amazing.

01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:02.860
It is pretty great.

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:03.940
All right.

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:06.700
So let's move on with Logie.

01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.220
All right.

01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:14.220
So you know, that game that everybody's into nowadays, that Star Wars Battlefront II, it's

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.460
being updated quite a bit.

01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.060
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:20.540
Not the Star Wars Battlefront II that's out now.

01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:22.660
But from 2005, actually.

01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:30.500
So the 2005 version, which is probably, I wouldn't say a better version, but the better

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:33.180
version is being continually updated.

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:36.500
There's actually a lot of people playing it still, and they've been doing some different

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:42.060
patching optimizations, including improving the lobby functionality, adding Steam usernames

01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:44.620
that show up correctly now when you're playing.

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:48.060
And then they had more accurate ping calculations, stuff like that.

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:52.780
So if you're sick of Battlefront II and you want to play some better Battlefront II, you

01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:55.980
can do that because they have it available.

01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:58.260
The classic version, I think on Steam.

01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:04.100
Yeah, I think they do sell the old one on Steam.

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.100
They do.

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:11.020
So, you know, definitely worth checking out if you don't have it.

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:12.740
And even if you do have it, you should just check it out.

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:13.740
Ten dollars.

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:22.100
Ten dollars for the non loot box filled garbage Battlefront II game.

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:25.020
Can I do a quick aside real quick that's not related to gaming that's going to disgust

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:27.460
all of you?

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:33.220
So Alan and I celebrated eight years of dating this past week because we started dating January

01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:34.220
4th of 2010.

01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:37.380
I just want to point out, no, and it is related to what's going on right now because he just

01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:39.820
got back from his other Sunday night stuff he does.

01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:41.620
And he just brought me a Starbucks.

01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:43.100
Didn't even ask.

01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:46.900
And he knew that I'd already had a coffee before the show because he said, it's hot

01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:47.900
cocoa.

01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:49.540
It's not coffee.

01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:50.540
What a guy.

01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:54.820
So I just have to, I just have to do a little wah moment.

01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:56.820
He just yelled from the living room, barf.

01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:00.980
Listen, this isn't River City Ransom.

01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:01.980
But it should be.

01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:04.060
River City Ransom is awesome.

01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:05.060
Oh my God.

01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:07.500
I'm just looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:12.340
I think the Ingress takeover is beginning because I see a Zet and Rockat are both in

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:14.380
our chat right now chatting.

01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:15.380
That's awesome.

01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:16.380
Sup guys.

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:21.380
Well, I think the only person I've spoken with is Rockat other than just seeing people

01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:24.740
in our group discussion.

01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:29.180
For those who don't know on Ingress, I go as Kurotsubasa, which is always the nickname

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:32.060
I use when dark Sakura is not available.

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.060
Fair enough.

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.060
Yeah.

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:35.060
Hot cocoa is good.

01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:36.060
All right.

01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:39.380
So we're going to move on to one more story before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:43.020
But this kind of has to do with classic games a little bit.

01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:46.820
This has to do with a new game and it's a shooter game.

01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:51.980
Dark Sakura, you might be into this, a top-down shooter and it's a Sega Sega, but it's going

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:54.820
to be on the mega drive, the Genesis and the Dreamcast.

01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:57.100
It is called Xeno crisis.

01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:03.180
They're trying to recreate the look and feel of classic Sega games to do this new.

01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:06.620
It's going to be new Sega Genesis cartridge and CD based releases.

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:10.600
So Xena crisis, it's going to be a procedurally generated labyrinth.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:11.900
That means a roguelike.

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:12.900
That's okay.

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:13.900
Uh, of alien.

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:15.540
It looks like, it looks like alien syndrome.

01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:16.540
Holy shit.

01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:18.740
Like, doesn't it just look like alien syndrome?

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:19.940
Alien syndrome.

01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:23.780
It does to me a bit, except it doesn't have the big blobby things everywhere.

01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:30.140
Cause that was always what defined alien syndrome to me, but dude, this fuck me, I need this.

01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:33.980
Well, you can go to Kickstarter because that's where it is right now.

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:38.660
They are looking at putting out the ROMs and cartridges in October, 2018 to try to be right

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:42.420
alongside the 30th anniversary of the mega drives launch in Japan.

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:44.660
You can check that out by searching Xeno crisis.

01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:48.260
That's Xena crisis, uh, over on yield Kickstarter.

01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.260
Good luck to those guys.

01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:53.260
10, 10 pounds for a 15 pounds for a downloadable ROM file.

01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:55.380
Yeah, not bad, right?

01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:56.380
Not bad at all.

01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:59.900
It's interesting that they're embracing that route too, where it's like Dreamcast

01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:00.900
file.

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:02.780
Oh, so you can burn your own disc.

01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:03.780
Why not?

01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:04.780
Yeah.

01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:05.780
Yeah.

01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:13.460
25 pounds gets you, um, the mega drive ROM, the Dreamcast file and the OST might have

01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:14.460
to get in on that.

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:18.460
But one of them says this is a switch download as well.

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:19.460
All right.

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:20.460
Anyway.

01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:21.460
Sorry to distract you, Jamie.

01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:26.100
We got to get to the classic game of the week, not halo talk about that earlier.

01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:28.580
That'll be later if you got, if y'all make it.

01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:31.860
But this week, dark soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that

01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:39.540
she thinks, Hey, you brats put down your new fangled breath of the wilds, your Mario odysseys

01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:45.980
and your, your pub G's or pug bees, whatever that thing is and play this game instead.

01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:46.980
Yeah.

01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:47.980
Classic game of the week.

01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:48.980
Dark soccer.

01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:50.740
What is the classic game of the week this week?

01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:58.220
Ray storm, which is a scrolling shooter, uh, that was developed by Taito.

01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:04.620
Um, it only came out in Japan and arcades in 1996 and later on there was a PlayStation

01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:11.260
port in 97 and the Sega Saturn version that came out as layer section two.

01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:17.940
Um, there were other releases of it that came, um, including versions and combinations, but

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:24.460
I'll get to that in a moment because Ray storm is probably one of my favorite, I would

01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:25.460
say shooters.

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:30.660
And on top of that, it was one of the babies that working designs released.

01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:31.660
There's no menu music.

01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:32.660
I need to fast forward here.

01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:35.620
Well, I think I put a timestamp in my original link.

01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:37.020
Sue me.

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.580
There we go.

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:40.580
Okay.

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:49.740
So, um, and it is in the whole series that was, um, uh, Ray force, Ray crisis, you know,

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:53.500
all of those, um, all of those Ray games.

01:28:53.500 --> 01:29:02.020
Um, and, um, so it actually is the big thing that sets this apart from the other ones is

01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:09.860
that the big thing of this is it started off, um, using, uh, polygon ships instead of sprites.

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:16.460
And, um, you basically have, um, different modes that you can play through.

01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:22.420
It actually has, uh, a few things with the PlayStation versions that made it similar

01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:24.300
to Xevious 3D.

01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:30.500
Um, but it all is pretty much that, that shooting, but it has another element to it.

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:36.340
Um, with the element as well, you have, um, a, you have your laser weapon as your primary

01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:39.300
offense and a missile that locks onto targets.

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:44.740
So you move around the screen, locking it onto a target, and then you shoot missiles.

01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:49.420
And then you have your special attack, where if you fill your bar to maximum, then you

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:50.420
get multiple lock-ons.

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:55.900
Um, you also have another one that's a hyper laser result that's basically like a, a charging

01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:56.900
blast.

01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:59.140
Um, you can play as two ships.

01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:06.220
One's the Argray, one that has a single laser that spreads out, um, and you have your lock-on

01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:08.420
and multiple missiles.

01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:13.140
And then the Argray 2, which is twin lasers, um, with higher attack power, but it has less

01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:14.140
range.

01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:17.420
Um, and your lock-on is 16 targets.

01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:19.740
Um, it has all kinds of different modes.

01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:23.980
You have the arcade mode, you have your extra mode that has enhanced graphics and extra

01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:27.940
enemies, different bosses, tougher difficulty, and a different ending.

01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:34.300
Um, and in extra mode, you get a continue that lets you continue to add up your score.

01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:41.020
There's another one that's called 13 players, which, um, if you, um, you have to complete

01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:46.820
the game using a total of 13 ships from five groups, three Argray 1 ships using manual,

01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:52.460
um, three using, uh, a different man- uh, three Argray 2 ships with manual control,

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:56.860
and then you have, um, the auto methods, basically you have to use every type of method, and

01:30:56.980 --> 01:31:02.620
then the Argray Zero prototype ship that you, um, basically have to obtain for the game.

01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:08.900
And you'll also get a fourth ship called the Argear that you will be able to play.

01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:16.620
So, um, this game basically, I would probably say is one of, I'd say the best games that

01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:19.060
came out in the PlayStation era.

01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:27.220
So, um, it really was, number one, a challenging game, but also a pretty game with great music

01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:28.220
as well.

01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:31.820
It's a shooter game I remember, and that says something, but it's that style, it's that

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:38.060
the way the polygons are kind of like 3D-ish tilted down, like a kind of Zelda adventure

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:42.740
of Link style, but more with polygons than sprites, because, you know, it's got a great

01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:43.740
look to it.

01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:49.620
Well, at any rate, um, they had talked about there being, this actually went through kind

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:53.940
of an interesting development cycle for, um, actually it should be more with the North

01:31:53.940 --> 01:32:00.460
American release of it, is that several companies were trying to get it released, but no one

01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:01.820
came forward.

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:09.180
Working Designs was working with Taito to try to license Rayforce, but Acclaim stepped

01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:10.820
in and did that.

01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:15.700
So when Raystorm came out, they jumped right in on it, licensed it immediately, and met

01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:21.580
with Taito to talk about the conversion for an American release.

01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:25.780
It was their first release for the PlayStation by Working Designs, and it was released under

01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:30.060
their Spaz label for shooter games.

01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:39.540
It was also, um, the, uh, you know, listed as, you know, a full, you know, Ray game.

01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:42.540
I use that quote fingers that no one could see.

01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:47.340
And then a playable demo came out, one of those little interactive CD samplers.

01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:55.580
So after Squeamix acquired Taito, it came on as a PlayStation Network game in Japan

01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:57.420
in 2008.

01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:04.580
And then, um, basically all the other ones came out eventually on PlayStation 3 and PSP.

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:09.060
And then there was the Raystorm HD that came out as a downloadable for PlayStation 3 and

01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:11.860
Xbox 360 in 2010.

01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:18.620
And we got it in the U.S. and Europe as well, I'm sorry North America and Europe, and, um,

01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:23.180
the original game though played on a Sony ZN1 JAMA board.

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:29.260
So, um, there are hacked versions of it that will play on the Taito G-Net system, so there's

01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:30.260
that too.

01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:36.640
So as far as compilations that came out, there's Taito Memories Volume 2, which in Japan was

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:40.140
Taito Memories Gekkan that had a bunch of other Taito games.

01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:46.540
There's Taito Legends 2 for PlayStation 2, G-Darius plus Raystorm pack, and, um, Simple

01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:52.100
1500 Series Volume 7, the double shooting for PlayStation, which also included Ray Crisis.

01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:54.060
I love the Simple series.

01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:56.060
You do?

01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:57.060
Yeah.

01:33:57.060 --> 01:34:03.060
Because the Simple 2000 series is what brought us the Defense Force and the Chambara.

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:04.060
Okay.

01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:13.780
Um, the other thing, um, is that working designs, as they've been known to do, um, revised the

01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:16.700
difficulty in it.

01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:23.020
They basically, um, made it a little bit tougher, I think, so if you can, if you set

01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:28.500
the difficulty below 4, then it runs a training mode, but after 4, it's like the full version,

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:35.340
so basically, it's trying to encourage people to play it on higher difficulties, um, and

01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:41.060
that they fixed an issue with the Japanese version where compatibility, um, with certain

01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:44.620
game controllers, uh, there was some issues with compatibility.

01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:50.540
Um, there's another version of Raystorm, uh, by Cyberfront that came out, um, for, uh,

01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:56.380
DOS, um, that was, uh, based off of the PlayStation release, um, but it didn't have, like, all

01:34:56.380 --> 01:35:02.580
of the arranged items, and then, um, the PlayStation 2 version of Taito Memories and Taito Legends

01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:06.940
2 only has the arcade mode list, uh, in the series.

01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:16.020
Um, so yeah, basically, um, the game itself, it was considered a little short, but it was,

01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:24.020
you know, amazing to play, lots of fun, and of course, those, uh, difficulty, um, levels

01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:28.460
would, you know, definitely encourage, you know, replay and an ongoing challenge, especially

01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:32.860
when you're trying to unlock things and get extra, the extra ships and trying to get the

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.180
true ending.

01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:41.380
Um, now, it did have quite the legacy, um, so Raycrisis did come out two years later,

01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:47.260
and it had, um, the home versions actually had the Argue 1 and 2 as hidden ships from

01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:53.880
this game, and then Taito, um, released, uh, Huda Huda Park that was a collection of minigames

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:59.740
that was inspired by their arcade games for the, uh, that was put out for the Wii, and

01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:08.140
it had, um, uh, Raystorm minigames that were basically, uh, kind of bullet hell minigames,

01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:10.140
so there you go.

01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:15.140
Alright, classic game of the week, real classic shooter, Raystorm.

01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:17.740
Raystorm, what a great game.

01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:22.500
And don't worry, guys, I will eventually do some of the Thunder Force games, a couple

01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:24.140
of people have asked me privately.

01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:29.020
You know, you've done now, you're coming up on 500 classic games of the week, I mean,

01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:32.020
I've helped, Loki's helped, some of our guests have helped in the weeks you haven't been

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:35.220
here, but you're coming up on almost 500 classic games in the archive, can you believe that?

01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:39.020
But remember, y'all, if you want Halo, 300 more dollars.

01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:43.820
Alright, um, well, we're gonna take a break, and when we come back, we have plenty more

01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:47.220
show to come, including rapid fire news, we're gonna do some release dates, and take your

01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:51.620
calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, that is all coming up after we take a quick break,

01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:55.020
so don't go anywhere, we're gonna be right back with the conclusion of tonight's Orange

01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:55.920
Lounge Radio.

01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:07.820
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 713

01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:15.420
in progress for this January the 7th of 2018, our first show of our 16th year of broadcasting,

01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:17.620
if you can believe it, since 2002.

01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:18.620
We're getting old.

01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:24.020
Alright, you missed some of our 2018 predictions early on, as well as kind of looking back

01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:27.020
at the messy notes we left ourself.

01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:31.420
Somebody should've told us to clean up those notes earlier, oh well, we learned for next

01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:32.420
time.

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:35.320
Let's get back into some gaming news, and we'll get to your calls a little later at

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:39.720
Orange Lounge Radio, I don't think we have emails tonight, I'm gonna have to have Dark

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:43.620
Soccer let me know in the mailbag, but we may get to calls a little sooner than that

01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:44.620
because of that.

01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:46.220
So, but let's do rapid fire news first, Loki.

01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:50.220
Yeah, so let's talk about some games that have been translated into English.

01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:56.020
And so one of these games, well, it's the latest Tingle game, that's right.

01:37:56.020 --> 01:38:03.620
So Ripened Tingle's Balloon Trip of Love, which was released in 2009, has now had an

01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:06.120
English patch created for its ROM.

01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:11.820
So if you feel like playing that, you can now download the patch to play it in English.

01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:12.820
Hooray.

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:15.620
I'm so happy that you are reporting this news to us.

01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:16.620
Yes.

01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:21.300
Another game that's also been translated in English now is Super Famicom Wars, is now

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:24.120
playable in English as well.

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:29.680
It came out, I guess, on the Game Boy Advance in Japan.

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:33.560
But yeah, that's pretty cool as well.

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:40.520
And of course, if you're not into translations, maybe you're into fan mods, in which case

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:46.420
you can play the newer Super Mario Brothers DS.

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:52.080
So they did a newer Super Mario Brothers game out on the Wii, but this is actually a mod

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.280
of the DS game.

01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:59.600
It's a fan-made game, and you can actually only play it on the PC, because it doesn't

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.780
run in an actual ROM.

01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:09.780
But yeah, it was made using the new Super Mario Brothers editor, apparently.

01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:15.880
So there you have 80 levels, eight world maps, and they even had some changes to the graphics

01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.880
and a new soundtrack.

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:22.420
So you can check that out as well online.

01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:25.340
That's cool that they even went in and did the soundtrack.

01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:27.540
Yeah, the music was different.

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:33.620
I didn't really play the new Super Mario Brothers on DS, or at least not enough to see half

01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:34.620
this stuff.

01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:38.620
So I'm not positive how much of this is all really new, but I see Mario in a minecart.

01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:40.180
I don't remember if that was in the game.

01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.740
Yeah, that's pretty neat.

01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:46.380
All right, well, a little change in Pokemon Go, for those of you that are still playing

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:47.880
Pokemon Go.

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:51.500
It's a lot more of you than people tend to think, because I was at...

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:56.060
I didn't talk about this on the show, but I went to a nest here locally.

01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:58.100
You know how Pokemons nest in certain areas?

01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:02.180
So over in a not so great part of town is where the Wailmers are nesting.

01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:08.340
And Wailmer is a Gen 3 whale Pokemon, and like Magikarp, it takes 400 candies to evolve

01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:09.340
one.

01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:10.940
So you have to catch a lot of Wailmers, right?

01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:15.180
So I was actually at a farm, and there was a lot of people walking around that park and

01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:17.740
all staring at their phones, playing Pokemon Go.

01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:19.500
So it's still a thing.

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:24.140
So I know there's some people that were a little sad to hear that, yes, there are more

01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:27.380
Pokemon that are being region exclusived.

01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:30.420
But this time, something unique happened this past week.

01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:31.780
They flipped.

01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:36.300
So Zangoose and Seviper were region exclusives.

01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:40.340
And that's probably because in the original anime and in the games, they had a little

01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:41.340
bit of a feud.

01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:45.100
Because I don't know if you guys know, but Mongooses and Mongoose snakes are kind of

01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:46.100
like a rivalry.

01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:47.660
Yes, I saw Ricky Tiki Tavi as well.

01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:48.660
Yeah, there you go.

01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:50.660
They have rivalry in the games as well.

01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:52.560
So they stay far away from each other.

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:59.100
But unlike Kangaskhan and Taros and Mr. Mime, what happened is that Zangoose and Seviper

01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:00.340
flipped.

01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.500
So they flipped.

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:04.580
So now we can't catch Zangoose anymore.

01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:08.540
Hopefully you got one while they were here, but you can get Seviper, which I still have

01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:11.460
yet to see one, but I'm hoping I get to see either of those.

01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:14.980
Well, the good news, there was a Zangoose on the house here not that long ago.

01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:18.620
I'm lucky in that for some reason, like there's always like three Pokemon on top of the house.

01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:20.580
Yeah.

01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:21.580
Yeah.

01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:25.060
So, uh, but something to keep in mind is that if they flip this, maybe they'll flip back.

01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:29.660
But what I'm really hoping is that Plusle and Minosyn, I hope I said their names right,

01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:30.860
but it's plus and minus.

01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:33.420
Little Pikachu ripoffs, the battery Pikachus.

01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:35.940
The battery Pikachus are also region exclusive.

01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:41.340
So we have Plus and Asia and you know, everything on the other side of the ocean has a minus.

01:41:41.340 --> 01:41:43.660
Remember when I run one plus use of those at E3?

01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:44.660
Oh, I do.

01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:45.660
They're so cute.

01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:46.660
I need to get them back from Julie.

01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:47.660
They are really cute.

01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:49.660
Maybe those guys will flip too.

01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:50.660
That would be very nice.

01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:55.500
So, uh, JD in our chat says, I got two, it's been very cloudy.

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:59.220
So poison boost and act F correcting me on the names there.

01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:07.740
Plusle and minion are the names there, um, over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:13.960
All right, let's move on to one other quick news, which has to do with the Miiverse archive.

01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:19.120
The Miiverse archive or archive verse has, uh, been made live.

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:20.120
It's up.

01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:25.600
Uh, you can dig through old Miiverse posts from the Wii U and the 3DS, apparently over

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:33.240
8 million user profiles, 133 million posts, 75 million screenshots, 72 million drawings,

01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:37.360
almost 17 terabytes of data.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.720
And what's really cool about this is one of the big guys behind this, it's doing this

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:46.640
drastic actions, uh, has listened to, uh, some of our podcasts in the past, at least

01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:47.640
more Bobby Black Wolf.

01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:48.640
I know.

01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.440
And in fact, Bobby Black Wolf had him on a show.

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.840
Uh, I think it was the week I was in Seattle.

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:53.840
So it was in early November.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.540
So if you want to hear more about the project, you can check out that episode of Bobby Black

01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:02.640
Wolf show, but it is noteworthy that the project did go live this past week.

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:04.480
So a lot of people are checking it out.

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:09.960
So if you want to check out the, uh, archive, you can do that at Archie verse, A R C H I

01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:14.680
V E R S E dot guide G U I D E.

01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:20.360
There you go to register participation for this week's episode of orange laundry 80 with

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:21.880
vog network.com.

01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:27.400
Use the passphrase B let's move on and our soccer.

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:34.160
You have a couple for us, a couple, um, it would help if they didn't like go off my screen.

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:35.160
There we go.

01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:39.880
Um, so the IGN editor in chief was fired.

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:44.000
Um, basically it was over alleged misconduct.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:51.940
Um, so basically, um, IGN, uh, put out the investigation regarding Steve Butts and as

01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:55.760
a result, they have decided to part ways with him.

01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:02.560
Um, this was a statement by Mitch Galbraith, who is the executive vice president.

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:09.400
Um, and the, uh, co-founder and chief content officer, Pierre Schneider will be taking over

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:11.560
as editor in chief on the interim.

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:17.640
Um, the update, um, basically says that Pierre Schneider will be taking over as long as it

01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:20.160
takes to get everything right.

01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:26.080
Um, so yeah, pretty, uh, crazy stuff.

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:31.240
Also noteworthy as, you know, IGN was in the news not that long ago for purchasing humble

01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:32.240
bundle.

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.340
So this, you know, transition, which, you know, if the allegations are true by sounds

01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:40.320
like 2017 is continuing to take out the garbage.

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.520
Um, but, uh, definitely garbage.

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:48.920
So anyway, but looking, looking to new year, new me, new society, um, hopefully, uh, the

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:52.640
humble bundle, you know, and all that stuff is going to be overseen by this new guy here.

01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:56.840
Well, the other thing too, is that this basically stemmed from, I'm going to mispronounce her

01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:02.120
last name, but it's Kelly plague, plague, P L A G G E.

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:03.680
Who is an editor at GameStop.

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:06.520
She went public, um, uh, for game spot.

01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:12.240
Sorry, went public about her experiences working at IGN, that a senior staff targeted her and

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:17.260
another female editor with quote manipulative and abusive comments.

01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:21.080
And it was also terribly mishandled by HR.

01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:24.880
And that's why she left because she didn't feel safe at her job.

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:29.440
So I know a lot of talk in the golden globes going on tonight has to do with everything

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:32.840
that we heard about with the, the garbage dumping in the film industry this past year.

01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:38.100
So just a unfortunate reminder that it wasn't just the movie industry that was affected

01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:45.720
by this, but you know, to try to turn, you know, something that's horrible into something

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:49.240
better, you know, at least this shift in our society.

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:53.400
Hopefully a lot of us are kind of reflecting going, you know, I'm going to make it my resolution

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:57.600
or whatever you want to call it to not be shitty to people.

01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:06.480
You know what, and it's, it's a little bit of a quote, but if, and this especially goes,

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:13.680
if you are teaching your daughters to be careful around men, then teach your sons what consent

01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:16.220
is.

01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:19.160
You know, it's fucking stupid.

01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:23.000
Don't pass on this whole toxic masculinity thing.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.200
Teach your, teach your kids to not be shit hole garbage.

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:27.200
Yeah.

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:28.800
Let's end it.

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:32.240
You know, if the, if the millennials really want to stick it to the boomers for all the

01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:38.200
bullshit avocado toast articles, be the generation that ends this shit.

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:39.200
Do it.

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:40.200
Do it.

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:43.560
You can, you can start right now by teaching your kids to stand up for what they believe

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:45.940
no matter how bullied or picked on they are.

01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:49.440
As borderline shillenials or whatever they call that.

01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:50.440
It's zenial.

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:51.440
Zenial.

01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:55.480
And I think I am just at the edge of Gen X.

01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:56.480
Yeah.

01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:57.760
You know, whatever.

01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:58.760
Well anyway.

01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:00.600
We were the, we were the awesome ones cause we had grunge.

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.600
And Radiohead.

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:13.960
Anyway, so another good, this is some good news, is that basically the, the developer

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:21.480
at Capcom who is behind Rival Schools and Capcom versus SNK and Devil May Cry, Itsu

01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:29.000
no Hideaki, basically has come out and said that they are working on a new game under

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Climax.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.040
In fact, I'll just read the quote, happy new, and it's in English by the way, um, happy

01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:35.040
new year.

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:38.720
I am sorry that I cannot present a new project last year.

01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:42.320
The development of the project is now under Climax.

01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:44.080
I am making a great game.

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:45.880
So please expect it.

01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:50.080
It does kind of sound like you ran it through Google translate.

01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:51.080
A little bit.

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:55.760
Well, honestly enough, usually if I can't figure out how to say something right in Japanese,

01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:58.680
it comes out sounding like it came through Google translate as well.

01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:05.600
So, um, but, uh, we're hoping that it's a fighting game.

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.600
I would really, really like another Rival Schools.

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:12.360
Um, cause I mean, that's serious, your expectations.

01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:16.320
So you're not mad if it isn't, but well, the gaming industry, I already predicted I would

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:18.320
be disappointed the entire year.

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:20.120
So that's true.

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.920
We'll see how that stays out.

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:26.560
Um, but if God, if we have another Rival Schools, that'd make me happy.

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:27.560
Of course.

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:28.560
I'm also, you're not alone in that.

01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:30.960
You know, I didn't put it in the time capsule.

01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:34.960
I should have put the one game I'm looking forward to, which is a Dragon Ball Fighter

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:35.960
Z.

01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:38.320
Oh, there that's not that long that you have to wait for that.

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:39.320
No, not at all.

01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:44.840
That's going to be mine, especially since I'm, God, I hate this current art.

01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:48.560
You didn't, you didn't put that on your games that you were anticipating to be good.

01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:51.000
I didn't, I didn't make a list of games I anticipated to be good.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Oh, I thought you did.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.520
No, I could just go write it down real quick and put it in there.

01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.160
Do it when I'm not looking.

01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.160
It's sealed.

01:48:58.160 --> 01:48:59.160
Okay.

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:00.160
All right.

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:03.400
But, um, but, uh, I'm kind of disappointed with the current story arc in Dragon Ball

01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:11.040
Super cause I, it's more of the endless stream of bullshit filler, but I do like a lot of

01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:13.920
the characters that are in it and finding out that some of these characters are going

01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:14.920
to be in the game.

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:17.400
It makes me really happy.

01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:20.460
You know, what's weird since you brought up anime, you know, I've been talking a lot about

01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:24.320
magfest all the way out in Washington DC, the other coast, right?

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:28.340
Yet here locally this weekend, we had a con that's actually getting bigger and bigger.

01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:32.240
Like Rama was making posts about things that were happening out here at SAC anime.

01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:36.840
I don't know if you guys, but, but yet none of us went for some reason.

01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:41.240
I heard actually, uh, our buddy Shane went and I know was trying to meet one of the voice

01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:44.960
actors from Danganronpa and there was a ton of Overwatch voice actors there, I guess,

01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:47.880
but I just didn't make it out to SAC anime.

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:53.360
I went to one of the earlier ones that was like the now destroyed red lion in a panel.

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:57.780
We did a panel at SAC anime when it was still, maybe we should look into doing a panel for

01:49:57.780 --> 01:50:02.400
like the summer version, which I think the good, the game bang guys do.

01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:03.400
So why not?

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.840
Maybe we should do something with them about podcasting.

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:06.840
Yeah.

01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:14.500
Offered a Voltron it up like, like we do for, did for gamer X number one game podcasts.

01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.980
So, you know, I don't know if we can touch that.

01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:23.860
I'm going to assume that was an old banner before they, uh, I know we're going to give

01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:27.620
them a little shit, but you know, nothing but love for the other indie podcasts.

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:34.480
That's number one against what really us, well, no, I mean, I think there's a couple

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:35.480
others based.

01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:36.480
This is Sacramento.

01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:41.020
Ladies that have a board game podcast, I think video games and that's not video games.

01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:43.960
So I guess it's just us.

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:46.160
And you know what, there's gotta be others.

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:47.160
There's so many gaming podcasts.

01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:48.160
I just don't know about them all.

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:52.400
Oh, um, uh, the, the, the, uh, princess Irene had a show.

01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:53.400
That's right.

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:54.400
Is she doing it anymore?

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.840
I don't know if they put out new episodes lately.

01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:02.320
I don't know if they have, so yeah, anyway, all right, moving on.

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:06.400
Uh, this would be the part of the show where we would get to the mail bag.

01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:07.400
I should just say it now.

01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:10.840
I'm doing things out of order, uh, but there are no mails tonight.

01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:16.680
So if you want to send us an email to read next week, participate at orange lounge, radio.com

01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:20.200
would be the address to send that to a reminder.

01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:21.200
Next week.

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:26.560
Uh, we're going to have, uh, I believe last I counted for ladies who play Ingress, which

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:27.800
is a game we've talked about on the show.

01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:31.280
I know, I know not all of you are into it, but I thought it would still be fun to talk

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:32.280
about.

01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:34.000
We're not going to nerd out completely about the inner inner workings of it.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Cause I don't want to be those.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000
You guys don't play it.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000
I don't want you to be bored.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.200
Um, but we are just going to talk about like, you know, kind of more like the why, you know,

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:41.920
why do you play a, why is exciting?

01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:45.000
Cause, um, I think some of these gals do play a lot of other games.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.760
I think some of them don't, they only play this.

01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:47.760
So it'll be kind of a fun show.

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:51.480
So if you want to send emails to ask questions about that, uh, you can do that.

01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:53.920
Participate at orange launch, radio.com, or really you can bring up anything.

01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:57.240
You want to bring up a topic we talked about tonight or something new participate at orange

01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:58.240
launch radio.

01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:01.280
I'm sure that show will never go on tangents.

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:02.280
We don't go.

01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:03.280
I'm a little, yeah.

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:07.200
Next week show is probably going to be, and to top it all off, I just want to point out

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:12.040
next week is a three day weekend because smart Luther King day is the next Monday.

01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:17.420
So if I wanted to have a, I have a cocktail during the show.

01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:22.160
So on top of that, on top of the women taking over the show next week, which is fine.

01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:23.520
I'm all for all for that.

01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:28.200
Uh, I might, I may be intoxicated on top of that, so it'd be fun for the makings of a

01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:29.200
great show.

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:30.200
Yeah.

01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:31.200
It's all, it's all adding up.

01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:32.200
This will be it.

01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:33.200
All right.

01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:36.280
Let's move on to some release dates, although I think it's a little slow this week, right?

01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:37.360
Yeah.

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:39.760
It's still a bit early before the releases come out.

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.160
They still haven't quite gotten off of their holiday, but we do have a game coming out

01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:49.000
on the switch of escapists to, we'll be coming on the switch this week and that's literally

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000
it.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Yeah.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.520
The switch has still been pretty good about the digital releases.

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.520
Yeah.

01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:55.520
Yeah.

01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:56.520
And that's true.

01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:57.520
All right.

01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:59.700
Well coming out this week in Japan, Dissidia final fantasy NT.

01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:00.700
That's right.

01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:02.560
The Dissidia games getting its release in Japan this week.

01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:05.400
Us still has to wait a couple of weeks past 30th.

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:06.400
Yeah.

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:08.240
So I am curious though to see some gameplay though of it.

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:09.240
Yeah.

01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:10.240
Some of you.

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:11.240
Yeah.

01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:12.240
I'm very curious about the gameplay and some of you may not be able to wait and may just

01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:13.240
import it.

01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:14.240
So that'd be cool.

01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:15.240
Uh, she, I'll say a shoe.

01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:18.960
No kind of Indian sign that comes out as well from D three on a PS four this week.

01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:24.000
And then danganronpa three, uh, gets a price reduction as it moves into the best price.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.960
So I think that means there will probably be more danganronpa games.

01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:30.300
I don't think this will be the end of it, by the way, on the PlayStation Vita where

01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:33.680
danganronpa V3 also exists in Japan.

01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:36.060
It is also getting a price reduction over there.

01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:39.800
So check that out on the 11th, uh, nothing on the Nintendo switch.

01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:44.600
However, I think Dissidia is kind of the lone Wolf released this week, uh, over in Japan.

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:48.940
So I did want to mention as a random, cause I was kind of gleaming through the list for

01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:51.060
that's coming out for the next few months here.

01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:55.520
I did notice a title, um, called, what was it?

01:53:55.520 --> 01:54:03.520
The, um, a certain magical virtual on what a certain magical virtual.

01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:06.160
On from Sega.

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:09.660
It's coming out and PlayStation four and the Vita.

01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:10.660
Is it from Sega?

01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:12.760
Uh, it is from Sega.

01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:13.760
Oh boy.

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:14.760
Oh boy.

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:15.760
Dars.

01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:16.760
Oh shit.

01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:18.080
What is, I think we did.

01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:23.720
I think I remember, um, something about this where it's, it's sort of like a total magic

01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:30.680
sooner virtual on, you know, interesting.

01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:31.680
All right.

01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:36.640
And, uh, adaption and sequel to the crossover light novel.

01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:43.920
That was a crossover between, um, the Tawaru series and Denno Senki virtual on.

01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:44.920
So yeah.

01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:49.040
Well, Jamie, do we have anything in the UK this week or is it pretty quiet over there?

01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:56.080
A few things on the 10th, Furi or is it Furi anyway?

01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:57.560
It's Furi Furi both.

01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:59.920
And on the 12th, the nightfall for PC.

01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:01.520
All right.

01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:03.080
Let's get back into some other news.

01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:07.640
And pretty soon your calls at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype, Loki, you're

01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:08.640
excited about this, right?

01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:09.840
Super hyped about this.

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:13.740
So out of all the remasters that they could do, at least they picked a great one.

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:20.800
And so coming out this spring, EA will be releasing a remaster of burnout paradise.

01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:21.800
Woo.

01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:22.800
Hell yeah.

01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:24.240
Stan's pretty happy about that.

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:25.240
Yeah.

01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:26.240
This is, this is good news all around.

01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:27.240
Yeah.

01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:28.680
So it's going to be a remaster.

01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:30.680
Um, it's scheduled to launch.

01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:32.320
But are they still going to have the music licenses?

01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:38.640
So when I turn it on, take me down to the paradise city, like, is it still gonna, I

01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:39.640
don't know.

01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:40.640
Let's hope.

01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:45.640
Um, but yeah, this was, uh, they, there was an announcement on Twitter, um, talking about

01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:48.200
the remasters coming out in Japan, March 16.

01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:52.920
So I'd assume that the U S version probably around the same time, um, no word on music

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:56.800
licenses yet and no official confirmation yet either.

01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:02.560
But hopefully that's soon, uh, act deaf to chat says, I want a new burnout.

01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:07.400
So I mean, w will you accept this remaster in lieu of a new burnout at least I will accept

01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:08.400
it for now.

01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:09.400
It's something, it's a holdover.

01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:10.720
It's an, it's a nice bandit.

01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:12.720
It's a nice severance.

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:17.600
It's a nice offering from EA who let's be real EA is pissed off a lot of people.

01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:21.960
So this is a nice little like throw this slab of meat at the pack of wolves.

01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:26.760
Remember they were developing their like own, like criteria was developing their own like

01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:29.180
extreme sports game that kind of went under.

01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:30.180
So dope.

01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:35.240
Um, I don't remember what they're working on now, but can it be a new burnout game?

01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:36.240
I mean, come on.

01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:37.240
Cause it needs for speed.

01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:38.560
Games have been kind of lame.

01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:44.120
So I'd be fine with the burnout remake early part of the year and a new burnout game at

01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:48.180
the end of the year, uh, act Efton chat says, do you still want Avril Lavigne's girlfriend

01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:49.180
in the game?

01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:50.180
I forgot that was going to have to have it.

01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:53.200
You kind of have to, it's, it's a sign of the times at this point.

01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:56.440
But what I really want to do is I want to replace the music cause you could do this

01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:57.440
on Xbox 360.

01:56:57.440 --> 01:56:59.080
You play your custom soundtracks.

01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:02.440
So why not have my awesome nineties soundtrack?

01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:06.400
And so I can, you know, when my pink car cause you know, I drive a pink car comes out.

01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:07.400
I want that.

01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:08.400
Oh, don't don't.

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:09.400
Oh baby.

01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:10.400
Baby.

01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.360
How was, I suppose.

01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:14.560
Cause you know, that's how I play burnout.

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:17.840
I'm going to have to replace it all with super Euro beat.

01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:18.840
Super Euro beat.

01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:19.840
You're driving fast.

01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:20.840
You kind of have to.

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:21.840
It's fair.

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:22.840
It's fair.

01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:24.160
Or just take the sound soundtrack to Wangan midnight maximum.

01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:25.160
There you go.

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:26.160
Yeah.

01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:27.880
There's more driving there.

01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:28.880
Yeah, of course.

01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:29.880
Of course.

01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:31.480
JD says, replace the music with gay beats.

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:32.480
Why not?

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:33.480
PlayStation four taps into Spotify.

01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:35.200
I got my playlist ready to go.

01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:38.200
Let's do it anyway.

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:39.200
I'm down.

01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:40.200
This is a day one for me.

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:41.200
I know.

01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:44.520
I'm so I'm like, I actually am more excited about burnout paradise right now on my PC.

01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:48.400
It's like backwards compatible on Xbox one even, isn't it?

01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:49.400
Uh, yes.

01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:50.400
Yeah.

01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:51.400
It is.

01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:52.400
Um, so yeah.

01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:53.400
So let's do it.

01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:54.400
All right.

01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:59.320
Xbox one, uh, rest in peace connect, uh, the connect pretty much.

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:00.360
I mean, I don't know.

01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:03.480
This is circulating all the blogs this week and I'm kind of like, this is kind of one

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:07.920
of those foregone conclusion type of things because when was the last time a connect game

01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:08.920
came out?

01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:09.920
It's been a couple of years now.

01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:10.920
Right?

01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:17.680
I, yeah, I guess just dance still supports connect, but even just dances technically

01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:23.960
to the mobile, technically the remakes or remasters of the Disney connect the games

01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:28.240
supported connect, but they weren't, but then they also made it, but they weren't connected

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:29.240
game anymore.

01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:30.240
Yeah.

01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:31.240
Yeah.

01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:32.240
So anyway, here's the deal.

01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:33.680
The adapters are no longer being made.

01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:35.920
So Microsoft deceased production of these.

01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:39.360
You have to have one of these adapters to make the connect work on the Xbox one S and

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:40.360
the Xbox one X.

01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:44.640
Uh, and then in a statement Microsoft said, after careful consideration, we decided to

01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:49.120
stop manufacturing the Xbox connect adapter to focus attention on launching new higher

01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:53.720
fan requested gaming accessories across as box Xbox one and windows 10.

01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:58.560
So of course we don't know what that is, but that could be anything from hollow lens coming

01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:03.860
out events early, who knows to whatever else Microsoft may be working on random PR speak

01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:09.760
that just, you know, and again, I was, I kind of already had said my goodbye to the connect.

01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:14.700
You know, I think ever since they uncoupled the connect from the Xbox one, we all kind

01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:15.880
of saw this coming.

01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:21.360
Um, you know, but I think as much as people want to look back and go, Oh God, the connect

01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:22.640
was kind of garbage.

01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:23.640
Was it though?

01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:28.040
Like people were really into it when it first came for games again, cause I realized there's

01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:30.400
a whole nother side to this for games.

01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:33.760
People were really into dance central and I fucking love dance center.

01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:34.760
It was awesome.

01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:35.760
Pretty awesome.

01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:36.760
It was pretty deep.

01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:39.000
When the games were good, they were really good when they were bad.

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:40.040
It was obvious.

01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:43.640
It was a problem where like a lot of companies didn't know how to utilize it and they came

01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:49.960
up with like a bunch and even Microsoft, you know, the, they, they did a lot of this, you

01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:54.200
know, where it's like you can shout grenade and you throw a grenade.

01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:59.200
It's like, really is that much more convenient than pushing a button to throw a grenade is,

01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:04.680
is that really, you know, they have like, Oh, you could do all this voice searching

02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:05.680
and stuff like that.

02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:14.320
And, um, you know, the Xbox and honestly like I've got voice search on my, um, my media

02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:17.400
box, my Android TV or whatever.

02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:18.400
Never use it.

02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:22.560
So I thought you had to have a connect to do live streaming on Twitch through Xbox one,

02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:24.760
but is it true now that it supports any USB camera?

02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:27.920
Cause I thought I heard Bobby say that on his show and I was like, Whoa, that's news

02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:28.920
to me.

02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:30.360
I could have been streaming on Xbox one this whole time.

02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:31.360
Didn't even realize it.

02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:32.360
Yeah.

02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:37.260
Cause I have an old camera cause I upgraded the camera in the studio or in my office that

02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:39.780
I use with the green screen for, for Twitch and everything.

02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:43.000
But I saw my old camera, which isn't bad and I could use that on my Xbox one.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.340
So even with just the streaming stuff where like the camera followed you around, if you're

02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:51.700
walking around, that was kind of cool, but like one, since you're kind of bridging it

02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:54.720
to it, it did a lot for, you know, non game stuff.

02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:59.140
Like we've all heard the story about how connect was great in hospitals because it allowed

02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:02.860
people to, you know, keep the environment sterile because when you're using motion and

02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:06.620
not using the actual tools or anything, you're just using, you know, air, you're not getting

02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:09.180
anything dirty so you can keep the environment sterile.

02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:14.900
So, you know, connect has done a lot of great things for, you know, other types of stuff

02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:19.820
that isn't just games, but it brought Para to the Xbox three six.

02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:20.820
Why not?

02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:21.820
Why not?

02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:22.820
Because they had dance paradise.

02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:23.820
That's true.

02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:24.820
They had dance paradise.

02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:26.420
It was a terrible game, but it could have been better.

02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:28.780
It was just, it was hard to, it was hard to understand.

02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:32.860
Next to dance central, dance central kind of, yeah, dance central is much better.

02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:39.540
Although, although if we're going to be fair, dead central, while it was an excellent game,

02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:45.660
if it weren't for Dan central, we wouldn't have the stupid dancing game that was in star

02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:46.660
Wars connect.

02:01:46.660 --> 02:01:49.900
I was about to say star Wars connect was kind of the beginning of the end.

02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:50.900
Yes.

02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:51.900
Star Wars connect.

02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:52.900
No.

02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:53.900
Yeah.

02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:54.900
That was kind of the beginning of the end.

02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:58.600
Bad, bad Microsoft and a Bobby confirming in our chat at live.vognetwork.com it does

02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:00.200
support USB cameras as of October.

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:01.360
See, that's news to me.

02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:02.360
So that's awesome.

02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:03.360
Cool.

02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:06.600
So, well, you know, who knows the connect maybe back in some other form or technology.

02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:07.600
I hope not.

02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:09.240
Well, I don't, here's the thing.

02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:14.480
I think the whole like dual cameras to kind of sense like space and stuff like that kind

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:20.560
of like you see that type of technology in mobile phones at this point, like how does

02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:22.560
Apple's portrait mode work?

02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:23.560
It's kind of similar.

02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:28.880
I mean, it's, it's different, but it's, or the face scanning technology is just, it's

02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:31.000
not that dissimilar from connect.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.600
It's just a lot more advanced because it's many more fricking laser beams going at your

02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:35.600
face.

02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:41.760
So I think the legacy of this technology is going to be in devices from here on out.

02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:45.320
But as far as connects time and gaming, we're done.

02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:46.760
I just don't want them to release it.

02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:49.840
They better not release another connect with the next system or something like that.

02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:51.160
I hope they don't do something like that.

02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:55.400
Because I've already been burned so many times, so I, I don't trust them anymore.

02:02:55.400 --> 02:03:00.480
All right, let's move on with some more stories and I think you have something for us, right

02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:01.480
Jamie?

02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:02.480
I do.

02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:03.480
Don't I?

02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:04.480
You sure do.

02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:05.480
I think it's a world traveling story.

02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:06.480
Yep.

02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:09.080
It's about Spain.

02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:18.400
Basically a lot of independent developers in Spain are pretty much going to be really

02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:19.400
unhappy.

02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:28.280
They have had a, there's been a decision passed on in the government to block 2 million euros,

02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:37.760
which is about 2.4 million dollars in European Union funding for local gaming, for game development.

02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:45.860
The minister of energy, tourism and digital agenda, Alvaro Nadal, canceled the grant,

02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:49.580
which was going to go to 20 different developers.

02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:55.340
Each developer would have received between 50,000 and 150,000 euros.

02:03:55.340 --> 02:04:00.060
And some of them were for teams of five people or fewer who were working on their first game.

02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:08.740
So it's really been a major, a major hurdle, I really, some of the most recent games and

02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:14.620
forthcoming games that were coming out of Spain was Crossing Souls from 4 Attic, Metroid,

02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:21.540
Samus Returns from Mercury, Steam, and Rime and the Sexy Brutale from Tequila Works.

02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:28.820
So and then basically now, there's been an update to this since I first read it, is that

02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:34.740
they are working on restructuring the grant rather than cutting it completely so that

02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:39.420
they, I guess, can make sure that the money will be used wisely and used efficiently.

02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:46.800
So I guess they are doing it, but then again, just that first announcement just seemed like

02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:48.720
quite the blow.

02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:55.340
So just a reminder that games come from all sorts of places, not just the US and Canada.

02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:56.340
Totally.

02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:57.340
So just a reminder.

02:04:57.340 --> 02:04:58.340
All right.

02:04:58.340 --> 02:05:02.940
And Japan, of course, I can't leave them out, but you know, games come from Europe as well.

02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:03.940
All right.

02:05:03.940 --> 02:05:04.940
Loki.

02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:09.700
All right, so there's a brand new expansion, or no, it was a mod that's being worked on

02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:14.540
that expands Skyrim because, you know, there's a ton of those, but this one's been in the

02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:22.020
works since 2015, and it's an expansion mod called Lordbound, and basically they've added

02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:28.460
about 15 to 30 hours of extra content, tons of new dungeons and whatnot.

02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:33.700
It's supposed to be taking place in a location called Drudatch Valley, which they say is

02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:39.940
a new location, not in Skyrim, but it sits between High Rock and Skyrim.

02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:48.500
So since I don't know shit about the Elder Scrolls geography, cool, I guess.

02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:53.540
But it does look really neat, and so I guess if you want to check it out, they have more

02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:58.620
progress that you can follow up on, on a ModDB.

02:05:58.620 --> 02:06:01.140
But yeah, it's coming soon.

02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:04.260
2018 is what they're shooting for, for a release for it.

02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:05.260
It looks really cool.

02:06:05.260 --> 02:06:08.820
When do you think we're going to get an Elder Scrolls VI to fuck around with?

02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:12.140
Like you know, Skyrim's been out a while now, like I know it's like, it's all new again

02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:15.140
because of the Switch, but in reality, that game is aging.

02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:16.620
Hopefully soon.

02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:20.540
They've kind of, I don't know if there's supposed to be another Fallout game, like if they've

02:06:20.540 --> 02:06:24.220
got another team doing almost like a Fallout Vegas, or a New Vegas, or if we're going to

02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:29.300
get any more remasters, maybe like a remaster of like a Fallout New Vegas or something,

02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:30.860
which I'd play that.

02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:33.740
I need to go and finish four.

02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:38.540
The problem with four is I already know how it ends, and I don't want to go back into

02:06:38.540 --> 02:06:39.540
it.

02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:42.380
But I bought all the season pass stuff, which is probably a mistake if I haven't played

02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:43.380
through any of that.

02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:44.380
Oh, just check it out.

02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:46.700
Kaijuto in chat says, this mod sounds awful.

02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:52.500
It could be, but 38 hours extra content, I mean, being that I've already dropped several

02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:56.460
thousands of hours into Skyrim, why not more?

02:06:56.460 --> 02:07:01.540
I do want at some point to stream stuff, and Skyrim would definitely be one of my first

02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:02.540
choices.

02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:03.540
Do it.

02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:04.540
Do it.

02:07:04.540 --> 02:07:05.540
All right.

02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:08.460
Well, last but not least tonight, and y'all were wondering when I was going to officially

02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:10.780
bring it up, I saved the best for last, y'all.

02:07:10.780 --> 02:07:14.300
I wanted to mention, and I think it's already kind of been mentioned tonight, because I'm

02:07:14.300 --> 02:07:18.740
sure a lot of you have noticed, you may be watching it in another tab, but awesome Games

02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:21.860
Done Quick is underway.

02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:23.380
You can check it out, of course, on Twitch.

02:07:23.380 --> 02:07:26.660
You can also look at their website, gamesdonequick.com.

02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:30.860
They have a full schedule posted over at Games Done Quick, and I think right now, what are

02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:31.860
they on?

02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:34.300
Were there any, because I know they, oh, excuse me.

02:07:34.300 --> 02:07:38.180
They started Blaster Master Zero while we were mid-show, so I think they're about to,

02:07:38.180 --> 02:07:41.380
they're still on probably Batman Arkham Asylum, it sounds like, and they're about to get into

02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:45.660
Little Big Planet 2, where they're going to do a co-op speed run on New Game Plus.

02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:46.660
So that'll be interesting.

02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:47.740
Remember Little Big Planet?

02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:48.740
I know.

02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:49.740
I mentioned it today.

02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:52.100
I was like, man, I should play a little bit, because I saw it when I was looking at the

02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:53.100
roster.

02:07:53.820 --> 02:07:57.980
I'm like, I have Little Big Planet 3 sitting in my library, and I have yet to play it.

02:07:57.980 --> 02:08:00.460
I think I played Little Big Planet 2.

02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:02.340
I think I did.

02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:10.140
But what's interesting is that there is not, I don't believe it was noted, Super Metroid

02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:11.140
is not there.

02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:12.140
Super Metroid, that's kind of the point.

02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:15.140
But the last day, check out this lineup for the last day.

02:08:15.140 --> 02:08:16.140
You ready for this?

02:08:16.140 --> 02:08:19.700
Dark Soccer is going to wake up at 6 a.m. on the last day, Saturday.

02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:20.700
Why?

02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:21.700
Because that's the Mass Effect speed run.

02:08:22.220 --> 02:08:26.540
No, I'm not going to watch a speed run of a game that I enjoy for the story.

02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:27.540
What a spoilsport.

02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:33.380
I do want to see, and I watched it last year in the archives or whatever, the random...

02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:34.820
Yeah, you can always watch it on YouTube.

02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:40.940
The random item, Link to the Past run, where they shuffle all the items in the game.

02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:42.060
But check out this closing day.

02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:49.020
Mass Effect, Warcraft 3 through the Human Campaign, Diablo playing a sorcerer, Baldur's

02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:55.660
Gate 2, Bloodborne, Final Fantasy IV, Zelda Link to the Past, Mario World, and then lastly

02:08:55.660 --> 02:09:00.940
the big finale tonight, or the last night, Zelda Breath of the Wild.

02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:02.580
So there you go.

02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:04.340
And then who knows whatever little surprises may...

02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:07.460
The Breath of the Wild one's going to be 13 minutes.

02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:08.980
No, I think they...

02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:09.980
I think...

02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:12.540
Unless they're saying that you have to do a certain amount of stuff, but the...

02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:14.060
Yeah, I think it's a certain amount of stuff.

02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:18.980
But the, I think the world record right now for Breath of the Wild is like 10 minutes.

02:09:18.980 --> 02:09:21.380
They're anticipating three hours for that run, so...

02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:27.420
So they must be doing like all the shrines or something.

02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:28.420
Yeah.

02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:32.660
And I noticed in chat over at live.vognetware.com, Rock Hat says, I hate speedruns, but I do

02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:34.220
laugh at speedrun fails.

02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:36.620
Well, they've had a few fails through this whole thing.

02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:39.580
And even if you hate speedruns, I mean, it is for a good cause.

02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:43.900
So it's, you know, it's for the Prevent Cancer Foundation is where all the money is going

02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:45.420
this time around, so...

02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:50.140
The things I don't mind about speedruns though, is I love, well, you know, I have a minor

02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:53.580
obsession with, with glitches, you know?

02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:57.580
So I like watching the glitches and learning like where people have found the games are

02:09:57.580 --> 02:09:59.060
broken or going out of bounds.

02:09:59.060 --> 02:10:05.200
Well, I mean, that's what I was doing in WoW, remember when I got my, my Demon Hunter?

02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:09.940
I was going in all the old dungeons and exploring and posting screenshots and stuff.

02:10:09.940 --> 02:10:10.980
I love doing that.

02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:16.500
I like people that really work hard at these obscure fucking games.

02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:20.500
Like people that'll be like, I can speedrun such and such on the 3DO or something where

02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:22.340
it's like, you're probably the only person in the world.

02:10:22.340 --> 02:10:23.940
I'm the expert at running Pepsi man.

02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:24.940
Yeah, exactly.

02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:25.940
But there's people like that.

02:10:25.940 --> 02:10:28.740
Like I've, I've watched some of these people that are really into these like obscure ass

02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:29.740
games.

02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:30.740
And I think that like, I like that.

02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:33.300
I like watching them talking about the history of the game and stuff like that.

02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:35.180
And they talk about like why they like the game so much.

02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:37.040
There's usually some kind of history behind it.

02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:38.580
That's the stuff I really like.

02:10:38.620 --> 02:10:41.500
I actually am not as, but you'd be surprised.

02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:46.060
The Super Metroid running thing is kind of, I, I don't get quite the same thrill out of

02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:47.260
that as maybe the first time I saw it.

02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:50.380
I want to see a speedrun of Magic Pen Jell.

02:10:50.380 --> 02:10:52.380
Hah!

02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:55.940
Maybe, maybe you need to be the one to learn Magic Pen Jell.

02:10:55.940 --> 02:10:56.940
Oh my god.

02:10:56.940 --> 02:10:57.940
All phallic mode.

02:10:57.940 --> 02:10:58.940
All phallic.

02:10:58.940 --> 02:10:59.940
Yes.

02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:03.940
For those who don't remember, which I would think that game is eligible to be Classic

02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:04.940
Game of the Week now.

02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:05.940
But anyway, just saying.

02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:13.100
Magic Pen Jell was like a Pokemon-ish game on Sony, but you drew all the characters in

02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:14.100
like 3D.

02:11:14.100 --> 02:11:18.460
Yeah, you drew your characters sort of in 3D and it was basically, depending on what

02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:19.460
colors you used.

02:11:19.460 --> 02:11:21.100
Dicks, dicks, dicks, and more dicks.

02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:22.140
That's all anybody ever drew.

02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:25.000
Whatever colors you used, you gave you different abilities and stuff.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.740
And so you could just draw like a big ugly blotch of something and it'd be like the most

02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:30.740
powerful thing ever.

02:11:30.740 --> 02:11:31.740
Exactly.

02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:35.860
But yes, usually it was just drawing dongs, lots of dongs, dongs everywhere.

02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:42.500
I think we had like a 2DX controller that was a character one time, but mainly dongs.

02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:43.500
Oh yeah.

02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:46.860
Yeah, I think somebody made like a 2DX controller or something as a Pokemon.

02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:48.660
Just all these silly things.

02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:51.460
So anyway, Magic Pen Jell.

02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:54.180
That's a game that needs to be, that's the game I want to see a remaster for.

02:11:54.180 --> 02:11:55.980
Who made Magic Pen Jell?

02:11:55.980 --> 02:11:56.980
I don't remember.

02:11:56.980 --> 02:11:57.980
They did a sequel.

02:11:57.980 --> 02:11:58.980
It was called Graffiti Kingdom.

02:11:58.980 --> 02:12:01.340
That was like a brawler stuff.

02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:02.900
Brawler type game.

02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:06.220
But I don't remember the company that made it.

02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:08.300
Hold on, I'm looking it up.

02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:09.300
I know, I'm looking right now.

02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:10.300
It was...

02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:11.300
Taito.

02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:12.300
Taito, yeah.

02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:14.020
Taito published it in Japan.

02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:15.020
And H2...

02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:16.020
Garakuta Studio.

02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:17.020
Yeah.

02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:18.020
505 Games.

02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:21.900
The original name was called Doodle Kingdom.

02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:24.580
Well, Rakugaya Okoku.

02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:25.580
I made a doodle.

02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:27.540
Hey, uh, phone lines are open by the way.

02:12:27.540 --> 02:12:28.540
You can give us a call.

02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:31.580
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you'd like to give us a call.

02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:34.660
If you want to do it the old school way, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:12:34.660 --> 02:12:36.300
But Orange Lounge Radio on Skype should be the preferred one.

02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:38.260
Look at that, third picture in Graffiti Kingdom.

02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:41.420
Already found a dick wearing a top hat.

02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:46.140
Ah, internet, you don't let me down.

02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:48.780
That would be Sir John Thomas to you.

02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:53.540
It's actually Chody is his name.

02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:55.540
Lord.

02:12:55.540 --> 02:12:56.540
Write that down.

02:12:56.540 --> 02:12:57.540
Someone call.

02:12:57.540 --> 02:13:00.420
Whenever we get into that Orange Lounge Radio charity stream we've been talking about for

02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:01.420
years.

02:13:01.420 --> 02:13:02.860
Magic Pen Gel needs to be the kick off game.

02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:03.860
For sure.

02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:04.860
For sure.

02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:08.660
Uh, again, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the old school way to do it.

02:13:08.660 --> 02:13:12.940
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you'd like to give us a call.

02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:17.340
And apparently, somebody's trying to call us and it says we're unavailable.

02:13:17.340 --> 02:13:18.340
That's not good.

02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:20.980
Let me see if I can do it on my phone just to make sure everything's working.

02:13:20.980 --> 02:13:23.880
Because Bobby called us earlier and that worked.

02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:25.900
So I think the connection's working.

02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:29.820
But then again, Skype can kind of be a pain in the butt sometimes.

02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:32.380
So I just don't know.

02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:36.300
So if maybe somebody wants to help me fill a little time here while I do a test call.

02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:40.340
So as I was talking about the remaster of Burnout Paradise coming out on PlayStation

02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:45.660
4, not only is it rumored to come out on PlayStation 4, but the Xbox One and the Switch.

02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:48.440
So you can be playing Burnout Paradise on the Switch.

02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:49.440
That's pretty awesome.

02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:54.300
Yeah, I just did a test call and it worked.

02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:58.620
So yeah.

02:13:58.620 --> 02:13:59.620
Well those of you that...

02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:00.620
I think SSG100...

02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:01.620
So I gotta ask...

02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:05.820
Well, Bobby's not calling obviously, but the big thing I've been seeing that a lot of the

02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:11.300
streamers have been playing since it's a really retarded looking Second Life thing is VR chat.

02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:12.300
Oh yes.

02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:13.300
I've seen this too.

02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:14.300
I've seen some of the YouTubes.

02:14:14.300 --> 02:14:15.300
It looks hilarious.

02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:16.300
It looks stupid.

02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:17.300
It's some of the worst.

02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:18.300
It's dumb.

02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:24.500
Yeah, a lot of the stuff I've seen is the worst parts of gaming all in one little...

02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:26.380
Let them all live on VR chat island.

02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:27.380
That's fine.

02:14:27.380 --> 02:14:28.380
But I find...

02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:31.300
Any new technology that comes out.

02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:33.940
It's like we were just talking about Magic Pen Gel.

02:14:33.940 --> 02:14:37.300
Here's a pen so you can draw whatever you want.

02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:39.460
Chodymon is the first thing I'm going to draw.

02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:44.940
Like that's the thing is that you introduce society to a new technology and inevitably

02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:46.740
the first place you're going to take it is the gutter.

02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:49.420
But those people are always going to draw dicks no matter what it is.

02:14:49.420 --> 02:14:52.340
They're always going to draw dicks, their name's always going to be Chody.

02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:53.460
It doesn't matter.

02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:54.980
That's that person's thing.

02:14:54.980 --> 02:14:57.860
But then there are people that are like, I'm always going to create a Gundam.

02:14:57.860 --> 02:15:00.100
I'm always going to create Hatsune Miku.

02:15:00.100 --> 02:15:07.020
I'm going to do whatever and I'm fine with that.

02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:08.780
It was just, it was really dumb.

02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:10.020
But I watched it the other day.

02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:11.620
It's just, it was so dumb.

02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:12.620
It was hilarious.

02:15:12.620 --> 02:15:14.580
So it's like memes all over the place.

02:15:14.580 --> 02:15:16.780
Azzette in chat said rule 34 Rob.

02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:17.780
Yeah, that's true.

02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:18.780
That's true.

02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:24.380
Bobby Blackwell says it's not easy to create things for VR chat.

02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:26.100
It looks hilarious though.

02:15:26.100 --> 02:15:27.340
Okay.

02:15:27.340 --> 02:15:28.340
We do have a call coming in.

02:15:28.340 --> 02:15:30.260
I think this guy got his Skype issues resolved.

02:15:30.260 --> 02:15:32.540
So I think we can talk to him higher on orange on radio.

02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:33.540
Who's this?

02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:34.540
Hey guys, it's us.

02:15:34.540 --> 02:15:35.540
You're on your mat.

02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:36.540
Hey buddy.

02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:37.540
I was hoping you'd call in.

02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:39.740
Cause you are fresh back from magfest.

02:15:39.740 --> 02:15:40.740
Aren't you?

02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:41.740
Yeah.

02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:45.740
I just got back about two hours ago and that was a long drive from what I remember.

02:15:45.740 --> 02:15:50.300
Magfest is different from most cons I go to because the last day is like super cut short.

02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:52.140
Like they, they pull the plugs at noon or something.

02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:53.140
Right?

02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:54.140
Like it's, it's over.

02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:55.140
Yeah.

02:15:55.180 --> 02:16:00.620
I was in my car and driving at one o'clock didn't get home until, yeah, not that long

02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:01.620
ago.

02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:02.620
So, well, how was it?

02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:07.420
I know magfest had a lot of, it had a lot of issues with the hotel and all that stuff.

02:16:07.420 --> 02:16:09.700
People worried they wouldn't find a place to park.

02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:12.620
How did it all work out when she got there?

02:16:12.620 --> 02:16:19.040
Once it was there, you know, it kind of just felt like any other magfest.

02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:21.020
Things were a little bit different.

02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:25.980
Hotels, it seemed like for the most part for me, like I managed to get a room at the

02:16:25.980 --> 02:16:26.980
Gaylord.

02:16:26.980 --> 02:16:27.980
Lucky enough.

02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:32.260
If you feel a little guilty about it, but cause so many people didn't, but.

02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:33.460
No, you shouldn't.

02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:35.180
You've been, you've been promoting me.

02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:37.020
You're one of the people that got me to go to magfest.

02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:39.980
You, you're, you're, you're just as worthy as some other guy of getting the, uh.

02:16:39.980 --> 02:16:40.980
That's true.

02:16:40.980 --> 02:16:46.580
But you know, like I have several friends who like had to drive like 45 minutes to and

02:16:46.580 --> 02:16:49.020
from and like some people like had to take an Uber.

02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:50.300
That's, that's such a pain.

02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:54.660
And I get it like the Gaylord in, and if you don't know this venue, cause it's over out

02:16:54.660 --> 02:16:58.700
in the Washington DC area, it's technically National Harbor, Maryland, but um, you know,

02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:00.620
they, they do big political events there.

02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:05.620
Like I seem to remember like a week after the last magfest that I went to.

02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:07.980
It's like CPAC is, is in the grand ballroom.

02:17:07.980 --> 02:17:08.980
Yeah.

02:17:08.980 --> 02:17:14.340
Like, uh, 45 was there doing a speech or something and it was all over CNN and I was like, oh,

02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:15.340
that's weird.

02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:16.340
Cause I was just there at that same hotel.

02:17:16.340 --> 02:17:17.540
But anyway, it's a gorgeous hotel.

02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:19.860
So it's like, once you get to the venue, it's great.

02:17:19.860 --> 02:17:22.700
But the problem with National Harbor is it's like super isolated cause it kind of like

02:17:22.700 --> 02:17:26.700
sticks out into the, you know, there's only like a couple of roads in and out of there.

02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:27.700
Yep, exactly.

02:17:27.700 --> 02:17:31.980
And yeah, no, it's just like it's, it was so cold this year.

02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:32.980
Oh yeah.

02:17:32.980 --> 02:17:38.780
Cause we just managed to manage to avoid that big snow bomb, whatever it's called.

02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:39.780
Oh yeah.

02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:41.260
It was still like negative.

02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:43.420
The bomb cyclone or whatever they're calling it.

02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:44.420
Yeah.

02:17:44.420 --> 02:17:46.380
So then it was still like minus five outside.

02:17:46.380 --> 02:17:48.300
Oh, I'm kind of.

02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:51.060
In that regard, I'm kind of glad I skipped this year.

02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:54.960
You do remember though, because I remember you gave me mad props because I was out there

02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:57.940
doing Ingress missions in 20 degree weather last year.

02:17:57.940 --> 02:17:58.940
Yeah.

02:17:58.940 --> 02:17:59.940
You don't know.

02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:04.420
But you know, I didn't, I didn't, I miss, I messed up my streak so bad in Pokemon Go

02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:07.300
this weekend cause I did not want to go outside.

02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:10.900
I'm surprised there weren't a million pokey things going on in the hotel.

02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:13.580
I thought I remember there were a lot of, um, at least Ingress things.

02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:15.700
Oh, pokey things happened in the hotel.

02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:20.500
Actually, I think my Gyarados is from National Harbor.

02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:21.500
No, no.

02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:22.780
I was just like, you know what?

02:18:22.780 --> 02:18:27.380
It's just one of those things that I neglected to flip on cause I was so busy doing other

02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:28.380
things.

02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:29.380
That's fair.

02:18:29.380 --> 02:18:30.380
Well, let's talk about those other things a little bit.

02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:34.660
So I know there was some controversy about Tokyo Attack no longer doing the video game

02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:35.660
room.

02:18:35.660 --> 02:18:38.660
I don't know if they worked that out or what, but the arcade room kind of looks like it

02:18:38.660 --> 02:18:40.660
was, it was all right after all, right?

02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:41.660
Yeah, no.

02:18:41.660 --> 02:18:45.220
Um, well they did not work out their dispute with Tokyo Attack.

02:18:45.740 --> 02:18:51.420
They managed to, I don't know who it was, but they managed to meet up with another Tokyo

02:18:51.420 --> 02:18:57.860
Attack-like group and so they had just, you know, the big concern was with Tokyo Attack

02:18:57.860 --> 02:19:06.420
who handles a lot of the Japanese, um, music games and, and a lot of like other Japan games

02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:09.060
that have been at like a lot of other magfests.

02:19:09.060 --> 02:19:12.180
So they were, a lot of people were concerned like there's not going to be any DDR, there's

02:19:12.180 --> 02:19:13.820
not going to be Poppin.

02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:19.260
They managed to find someone else, I don't know who, who it is, and they managed to bring

02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:21.500
in a lot of those machines.

02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:23.180
So like it wasn't really missed.

02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:27.340
There was a ton of DDR machines, they still had UB, they still had some of the newer stuff.

02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:31.180
They didn't have all the new stuff, but they still had a pretty darn good share of it.

02:19:31.180 --> 02:19:35.220
So, you know, they did, you know, so they found a new partner and a lot of chatters

02:19:35.220 --> 02:19:38.540
pointing out that Tokyo Attack is actually at Awesome Games Done Quick right now.

02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:42.300
So, and I think, I feel like they were doing that before anyway, even when they were doing

02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:46.900
Magfest, they kind of packed all that shit up and, because what is, is Awesome Games

02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:49.420
Done Quick still just on the other side of town right now?

02:19:49.420 --> 02:19:50.420
It is.

02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:54.660
And it's actually, it's in the same hotel where the original Magfest was, I believe.

02:19:54.660 --> 02:19:55.660
Oh shit.

02:19:55.660 --> 02:19:56.660
Okay.

02:19:56.660 --> 02:20:01.140
So, you know, it's like, so like you have like a lot of, there were like, um, there

02:20:01.140 --> 02:20:04.740
were like a lot of like speed runners who are at Magfest as well.

02:20:04.740 --> 02:20:09.660
So like there were a couple like Mega Man speed runners who were doing the Mega Manathon,

02:20:09.660 --> 02:20:15.260
which is a big speed run marathon that they do at Magfest where they go through all the

02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:17.100
Mega Man games and speed run them.

02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:23.220
And then there was a popular Kingdom Hearts speed runner who did his own thing.

02:20:23.220 --> 02:20:26.580
I'm not surprised some people make a really long week of it, although that's a long time

02:20:26.580 --> 02:20:30.300
to be away, but for students and stuff, it might be a little easier to swing that sort

02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:31.300
of time away.

02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:34.180
I heard they made some changes to the concert hall this year.

02:20:34.180 --> 02:20:36.260
Did you like the new layout?

02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:37.260
They did.

02:20:37.260 --> 02:20:38.260
The layout was a bit different.

02:20:38.260 --> 02:20:42.700
I mean, so to kind of give everybody some context, the original layout for the main

02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:47.580
concert room was they had two stages on opposite ends of this big hall.

02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:54.460
So that way, in their mind, was to kind of set up one concert while the other one was

02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:56.540
still going on.

02:20:56.540 --> 02:21:03.460
The problems you kind of run into is that the bands were able to set up, but the, I

02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:08.460
guess, the sound crew, they weren't able to do sound checks properly.

02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:11.340
So they managed to just consolidate into one big stage.

02:21:11.340 --> 02:21:15.260
Oh, I remember the sound issues being a problem last year, too.

02:21:15.260 --> 02:21:16.660
So this was their solution.

02:21:16.660 --> 02:21:18.320
Okay, that makes sense then.

02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:26.320
So things kind of ran a lot more efficiently and also just, you know, the quality was better.

02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:33.240
So there were maybe slightly fewer concerts this year, but on the upside, every single

02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:37.280
concert started on time, every single concert pretty much ended on time.

02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:38.800
That is good.

02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:41.520
So everything just kind of worked out a bit smoother there.

02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:45.240
So they didn't switch, did they switch the orientation of the room where like the one

02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:48.960
stage was in the center of where it was before, or did they just use one side and that was

02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:49.960
it?

02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:52.320
They used the more centered part of it.

02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:53.320
Okay, interesting.

02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:54.760
So it kind of looks like they rotated the room.

02:21:54.760 --> 02:21:56.760
That would be kind of interesting.

02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:57.760
Yeah.

02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:05.280
The BF enough, for the most part, MagFest was pretty much about the same.

02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:07.600
Well, that's good.

02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:08.600
What was the...

02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:09.600
We're still...

02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:10.600
Go ahead.

02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:11.600
You first.

02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:12.600
Oh.

02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:18.360
So like, well, some of the negatives were like it was noticeably crowded.

02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:26.900
It was extremely crowded, especially Friday evenings and all of Saturday.

02:22:26.900 --> 02:22:31.840
So they might have hit their capacity, did they claim a sellout or no?

02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:38.040
They did not, but I'm curious because I think like a lot of people, like in the weeks leading

02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:43.140
up to MagFest, the months, a lot of people were selling their badges because they couldn't

02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:45.840
make it, because they couldn't get a room.

02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:51.160
So I don't know, like it may have been like a lot of local people, a lot of...

02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:57.240
But it was like a lot of people, like the past couple of days, the last day or two was...

02:22:57.240 --> 02:23:03.220
There was their first MagFest, because they heard it was kind of like a big party, so...

02:23:03.220 --> 02:23:04.720
Place to go drink.

02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:09.760
So what was the coolest thing you saw at MagFest?

02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:14.640
Coolest thing I saw was I was able to only catch a little bit of it, because timing and

02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:15.640
panels and everything.

02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:17.920
So the old show Nick Arcade...

02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:18.920
Oh yeah, I heard about this.

02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:19.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:20.920
Yeah.

02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:30.640
They managed to get Phil Moore, the original host of Nick Arcade.

02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:36.360
So they kind of did their own version of Nick Arcade with a couple of the indie games as

02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:38.320
kind of like the game challenges.

02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:39.320
Smart.

02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:41.080
So that was kind of cool.

02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:47.800
So they did that last year, but it didn't really like work out too well.

02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:52.760
But they had Phil Moore this year do it, and they did two showings.

02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:59.120
They did one with contestants from the crowd, and second night was special guests.

02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:03.160
They had Freddie Wong on there doing it as well.

02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:04.380
So it was...

02:24:04.380 --> 02:24:06.480
He kind of just didn't skip a beat.

02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:11.720
Was it like seeing the same guy from the 90s television, just right there in person?

02:24:11.720 --> 02:24:12.720
That's awesome.

02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:21.960
It was down to him making songs or spitting rhymes during the musical segments, if you

02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:23.640
can kind of remember, during the show.

02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:24.640
Yeah, I do.

02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:25.640
I do.

02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:26.640
I love it.

02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:32.440
So one more question I have for you, and then we'll let you go see if we get any other calls.

02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:38.000
As has been pointed out a couple of times, it was noted that the gentleman who invented

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:43.160
the Colossus roar, the infamous roar that happens at MAGFest, which kind of sounds like

02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:48.480
roar, roar, like a lot of people, and it gets louder and louder as more people join in.

02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:53.360
And truth be told, I kind of get annoyed with it by the last day of MAGFest.

02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:58.960
However, seeing that there's a little more sentimentalness to it this year, I probably

02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:04.220
would have made it the whole MAGFest and just silently nodded, what have you.

02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:06.280
But the guy passed away.

02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:14.840
So was the Colossus Roars in full force this year because of that?

02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:21.360
So on the machine that was his, they had a dedication and everything of him, and apparently

02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:23.400
Stan Lee had signed the cabinet as well.

02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:24.400
What?

02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:25.400
What?

02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:26.400
Oh, that's cool.

02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:27.400
Yeah.

02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:32.680
But no, I think there were a bunch, just kind of like the usual amount.

02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:33.680
All right.

02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:34.680
So the usual amount, which is lots.

02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:40.320
And I think people were able to kind of find out what the actual full story of it was now,

02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:43.240
because where it came from, why people do it.

02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:44.240
Exactly.

02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:47.400
And that was kind of my point, where it's like, well, now that I know the story, it's

02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:49.800
harder to be annoyed with it.

02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:50.800
You know what I mean?

02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:56.080
And to kind of quickly tell it for context to everybody who's listening, the story behind

02:25:56.080 --> 02:26:01.360
it is when they first started doing MAGFest, they had a couple of arcade machines, and

02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:07.540
one of the big things that they got was the 6-man X-Men arcade machine.

02:26:07.540 --> 02:26:13.480
And the machine's volume was turned up all the way, so during the whole show, anybody

02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:20.480
who's doing Colossus' super, you get the roar, constantly going.

02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:25.040
So that became kind of like the battle cry of MAGFest.

02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:28.000
Well, there's the story.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Yeah?

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Yeah.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.000
All right.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.040
We're gonna let you go see if we get any other calls in here, but thanks so much for the call. I appreciate it

02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:39.120
Yep, you're welcome. All right. Go on. Take care of my friend. Yep. Bye. Bye

02:26:40.060 --> 02:26:46.600
Yeah, Bobby black wolf and chat points out everybody everybody at magfest heard it all 1,000 attendees. That's why it's so iconic

02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:48.600
Yeah, well, it's hard to get away from that

02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:52.200
Colossus for let's get into some other calls here at chat

02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:58.880
Including this call. Hi, you're on orange on radio. Who's this? What's going on people? It's Ron man. Happy new year

02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:01.660
Hey, Rama, happy new year. It's great to hear from you. What's on your mind?

02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:13.560
From a con freezing my butt off these cold winds, but since we're talking magfest

02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:18.580
Yeah, let me tell you what really happened with Tokyo attack. Oh

02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:26.200
Okay. Sure cuz I found this out through some staffers. Um, cuz right here in New York

02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:33.960
We have like the underground staffing network, which is a combination of con staffers between several conventions in this area

02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:40.360
I am out at a party having a good time reconnecting with some people and a few people are asking me about

02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:48.420
Magfest I'm like, I'm not going because of the BS with the tickets and I'll tell I'm like I'll deal with it the following year

02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:55.720
And during the conversation I found out what really happened with Tokyo attack per se

02:27:56.920 --> 02:27:58.920
Whatever they were arguing about

02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:07.200
That's what it was. It seems that a bunch of arcade collectors stepped up and said

02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:10.320
Y'all don't need Tokyo attack. We got this

02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:15.340
Interesting so somebody kind of basically made in and made a counteroffer

02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:20.400
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I don't remember full details that but I do know

02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:28.740
From this point on when you go to mag fest now, you see all these arcade machines. These are from people's personal collections

02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:34.720
Well to be fair, you know and we are hearing from SSU 100 Matt who said, you know

02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:36.580
The arcade room was still fine, you know

02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:39.880
And somebody it was either him or Ziba sent me a picture of an f-zero

02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:42.840
Ax machine which there wasn't even that many of those in the u.s

02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:46.000
To begin with so the fact that they have one of those at mag fest was pretty impressive

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:49.040
So, you know mag fest arcade they did fine for themselves

02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:54.840
And we know the Tokyo attack had plenty of time to set up and do a good show over awesome games done quick

02:28:54.840 --> 02:28:58.880
So is this just maybe a everybody wins scenario? I

02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:01.320
Tend to think so

02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:06.400
But given some of the stuff that I've been talking with a lot of staffers and non staffers

02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:10.960
I mean if you're going to tell the story at least kind of tell it right

02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:12.240
Okay

02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:16.440
Well, you know but some some of it's a little bit drama and it's like, you know what?

02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:19.840
That's why I'm trying to focus on is everybody happy. Yes. Okay, great

02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:28.360
Yeah, well that's good well what so you say do you said you went to a convention this weekend yes

02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:36.320
Understand I have a soft spot for little local college conventions and I love them sure

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:38.400
Little conventions to

02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:41.760
Yeah

02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:47.880
We went me and Marco are we went to this Conco Katori car at a local college campus

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:56.960
They have like a little Friday get-together. Then the actual cars in three buildings on the campus and normally it's

02:29:57.560 --> 02:29:59.280
in January

02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:05.680
So you don't expect to walk around in the cold weather switching between buildings

02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:08.320
I

02:30:08.440 --> 02:30:10.440
Are yeah

02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:15.440
And you were posting about stuff that was going on at sac anime all the way out here

02:30:15.440 --> 02:30:20.920
That's kind of what made me laugh as I was like, wow, Sammy's getting big enough to where this it's not

02:30:21.880 --> 02:30:23.880
It's more like what?

02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:26.720
I guess it is a lot of

02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:34.100
Obviously a lot of fucking bullshit going on in the communities and there's a lot of people who look at me as some type of

02:30:34.900 --> 02:30:40.620
Mystical sage who can handle business the most that I can do is pay it forward

02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:45.780
You know sac anime thing was there was some creeper taking upskirt shots. Oh gross

02:30:46.820 --> 02:30:52.460
Might be the best I can do is tag friends who are in the area and pay it forward

02:30:52.460 --> 02:30:56.460
So are you you're being convention daddy looking out for everybody?

02:30:56.460 --> 02:30:58.460
I

02:30:59.540 --> 02:31:05.920
Honestly Rob, I've been conned daddy for about the last ten years more or less I have gone to many

02:31:06.860 --> 02:31:10.000
Con raves and met up with my female friends

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:14.720
Which is her who asked me to walk them back to their rooms because they're guys at the rave

02:31:14.860 --> 02:31:17.180
Who don't know how to take a hint, you know

02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:21.180
The unfortunate thing about that a-hole that's doing the upskirt pics and all that stuff

02:31:21.180 --> 02:31:25.260
Is that that guy probably don't even watch anime and isn't even a nerd in the slightest sort

02:31:25.260 --> 02:31:27.500
I mean it might be but unfortunately

02:31:27.500 --> 02:31:32.060
I think there's just there's just gross people that make their way into because they see opportunity

02:31:32.420 --> 02:31:37.780
And it's it's gross and I'm glad that we're coming together as a society to you know

02:31:37.780 --> 02:31:41.480
Put a stop to that shit and you know, we're looking out for each other and you know

02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:46.260
Hopefully if a girl catches him doing that they're gonna fucking speak the fuck up and get that guy

02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:50.820
Booted the fuck out in his phone thrown on the ground and stomped on or whatever. He's using to take the pictures

02:31:50.820 --> 02:31:53.840
And you're absolutely right you read if you go back

02:31:54.900 --> 02:31:58.660
The me to move movement remember sure. Well, how can you forget?

02:31:58.900 --> 02:31:59.780
Yeah

02:31:59.780 --> 02:32:07.020
It really exploded in the cosplay community because there are a lot of fucking creepers out there who don't know how to say

02:32:07.020 --> 02:32:11.540
No, they do this and they do that and I think I've known people

02:32:11.540 --> 02:32:17.100
I've been connected to people that I have disconnected myself from for their antics. We don't play that shit no more

02:32:17.740 --> 02:32:24.020
Yeah, you know and if you if you see a cute girl at an anime convention dressed up in an outfit

02:32:24.020 --> 02:32:29.260
Why don't you just ask polite or cute guy? Whatever it is. Why don't you just ask politely? Hi

02:32:29.260 --> 02:32:30.900
Can I take your picture, you know?

02:32:30.900 --> 02:32:36.340
Cuz a lot of cosplayers dress up so that they can get their picture taken, but just ask

02:32:37.940 --> 02:32:39.940
But sometimes

02:32:40.420 --> 02:32:42.420
We tend to read the body language

02:32:43.100 --> 02:32:45.240
Assume this or that and fuck it up

02:32:45.240 --> 02:32:45.580
Yeah

02:32:45.580 --> 02:32:51.940
Don't never assume anything and and if somebody doesn't want to have their picture taken don't take it as they're a fucking bitch or whatever

02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:55.800
It's just you know, I think we've all had this and I've experienced this

02:32:56.020 --> 02:32:57.880
sometimes your days are so

02:32:57.880 --> 02:33:03.860
Fucking long that when you've had it and some people use the analogy of I only have so many spoons for with the mental health

02:33:03.860 --> 02:33:05.860
I can handle so you've probably heard this this story before

02:33:06.580 --> 02:33:12.400
And sometimes people are out and they need a chance to drink their fucking Diet Coke and recharge and then they'll take the picture

02:33:12.420 --> 02:33:14.420
maybe later so

02:33:15.220 --> 02:33:21.860
It's like this sometimes I've been told not right now later and I'm like, oh, here's my card find me later

02:33:21.860 --> 02:33:25.660
They usually find me later or the next day and we take pictures here at times

02:33:25.660 --> 02:33:30.060
I take pictures of cosplayers while they're chilling and sitting down. I'm like don't get up. This is fine

02:33:31.300 --> 02:33:37.420
Yeah, so just ask and I'm sure you can get lots of pictures with cute girls and guys and people dressed up but

02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:42.020
Appropriately and per their boundaries not yours and also

02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:47.060
Every single every con has this they have a how to talk to

02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:54.780
Con guys and girls panel one-on-one how to talk to them how not to be a creeper almost every con has this panel

02:33:54.780 --> 02:33:57.640
It's an hour out of your out of your con weekend

02:33:58.220 --> 02:34:03.240
Go I was there. I went to that panel today and shared some of my old stories

02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:08.900
I'm hoping our listeners. We have a pretty good crowd that doesn't need to hear it. But just in case just in case

02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:15.320
You know that that's out there and there's no shame in attending these panels because Rama went to this panel today to help out

02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:21.340
So I'm gonna go you can go my friends was running the pound my guys swing by heard some of the stories

02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:26.200
Tell some of my own experiences from both sides. Are we good?

02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:31.860
As Joe and under Matt wanted to follow up since it doesn't relate to your call to a group named snow

02:34:31.880 --> 02:34:34.320
Phoenix was the group that picked up the music game slack

02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:38.460
Where'd the void from Tokyo attack was left at magfest. So there you go

02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:45.360
Okay, Rama, I'm gonna let you go cuz the coughing fit means time. Yes, and we will see you at magfest next year, right?

02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:51.160
Assuming I'm gonna use the disclaimer. I'm not putting up with hotel drama and I'm not doing this

02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:58.040
I will handle the hotel. It'll be bog winter confest 2019. We're gonna do it up. All right, I

02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:05.700
Under those conditions if I can stay in the National Harbor area and I'm even fine walking from one of the other hotels

02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:12.720
We're gonna book a room across the street and one of the Swedes mako chan is coming

02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:16.720
She is going to cook like mama Luigi. We're gonna throw down. All right

02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:23.160
As then let me follow up with this work you got that right, honey

02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:27.700
Yes, con daddy come through

02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:34.320
All right, I'm hanging up take care buddy, bye-bye

02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:38.640
All right

02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:45.160
Anyway, uh, let's see Bobby and chat says remember I snore that's okay. I wear mr. Smoosh snores

02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:49.320
So I wear and yes, it's loud because mr. Smoosh likes to sleep right next to my ear

02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:54.040
I wear earplugs, so that stuff actually doesn't bother me as much as you think

02:35:55.160 --> 02:35:59.520
All right. Anyway, but Bobby you don't come cuz this is January anyway, but maybe I don't know

02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:03.300
Maybe he maybe he's giving it some thought I don't know but I do want to I do want to make magfest next year happen

02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:06.240
It is a fun convention. So I just I'm like

02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:09.560
I'm I am NOT usually despite what?

02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:17.080
Captain Matt on starboard power coupling says I'm not usually the one to break out with ego. However in this circumstance

02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:20.640
I'm gonna be like the whole

02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:22.840
Because next year I'll be 40 years old

02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:29.440
So I'm gonna play the whole I am 40 years old and I don't have time to come I flew all the way out here

02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:34.360
From the West Coast. I have a podcast. I'm not taking a 45 minute uber ride

02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:40.480
So if I'm going to magfest next year, I'm gonna have a little bit of convenience that's the only way I'm gonna do it

02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:43.840
All right

02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:48.240
Anyway, huh? I think it's about time for us to wrap it up here at orange launch radio

02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:50.240

02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:16.840
