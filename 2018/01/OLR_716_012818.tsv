14000	20000	This week Nintendo has announced that Miitomo is joining everybody votes in the digital information ether. Be sure to save your decorations for posterity.
20000	27000	Tonight we're going back to the past but in a new new way. Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	38000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio.
38000	48000	Live tonight episode number 716 for this January the 28th of 2018. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter as Skye.
48000	54000	Joining me, not tonight, unfortunately DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She has the night off. She wasn't feeling too well.
54000	62000	As you all know she had some things a few weeks ago and I think she had a very busy day yesterday. I know she went to San Francisco.
62000	71000	I think something involved with her sister's thing that she's involved with. So she probably needed today to relax so we'll support that.
71000	77000	But coming back to the show this week. I guess they're flip flopping this month. Coming back to the show tonight, Tech Master Loki.
77000	81000	Hello. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing alright. Good. How was the kids birthday?
81000	90000	It was good. We just went and had some food over at Olive Garden. I wish somebody would do that for my birthday.
90000	99000	Well yeah, I mean he just wanted presents so he got his presents. He got Power Rangers. He's been getting in the Power Rangers. Shane would be proud.
100000	111000	So his favorite thing now is Power Rangers Ninja of Steel and Samurai. It's not the latest. I think it's one of them.
111000	120000	Because I think Megaforce is the latest one because it has all of them. It's sad that I know now about Power Rangers. I mean this is not sad but I'm starting to learn.
120000	122000	Something you never thought would happen.
123000	133000	But yeah, he's really into it now so he got a couple of the Ranger toys for his birthday. Then my dad came over and he's like what is he like.
133000	139000	I'm like well he likes Power Rangers, Ninja Steel stuff. So he ended up getting the Megazord thing which is exactly what he wanted.
139000	144000	Oh cool. Oh cool that worked out because we were looking for the other thing but this is what they had.
144000	151000	Nice. Yeah he's been playing with that. So yeah it went alright. It was just very low key. We didn't really do anything.
151000	158000	Good. Well we held down the fort best we could. I don't know if you heard the playback at all but we had an interview with an old friend.
158000	164000	The show Mel B was here via Skype last week and he was promoting the DDR freestyle tournament which happened on Saturday.
164000	170000	So his freestyle takeover happened and come to find out at the last minute they needed another judge because things happened.
170000	175000	Somebody wasn't able to make it so they actually reached out to me to see if I would judge it.
175000	183000	And I was really honored but admittedly I was a little scared about judging because I'm kind of like well I wasn't really a big freestyler.
183000	190000	Everybody else on the panel was a big freestyler. But then I also thought well does Simon Cowell sing? I don't think he does.
190000	197000	No. And I am really good at judging people. I do it a lot in my personal life. So yeah I did it and I had a lot of fun.
198000	206000	I was wondering like would my list match up with everybody else's but the good news is I picked the same winner that actually won.
206000	213000	So I guess I was on the same page after all. So it was good. But the tournament was good. I just want to give a shout out to everybody involved.
213000	221000	There was only about 9 people that entered which isn't quite maybe where Arcade Infinity was back in the day.
222000	227000	But I kind of see it as like a really good start to hopefully revitalize it. Like you got to start somewhere right?
227000	233000	Well to be fair it's kind of like a renaissance now to come back because it's not what it was back then.
233000	237000	No. Not yet but it could get back there based on what we saw at the tournament.
237000	243000	So I know they've been talking about doing it again soon and I hope they do.
243000	247000	And I think one thing that probably really encourages them is the big turnout on Twitch.
247000	252000	They had a pretty decent turnout on Twitch just from everybody around being able to check it out.
252000	258000	And even if there wasn't a ton of in competition routines to see. 9 isn't bad though.
258000	264000	There was a lot of exhibition stuff. Like a lot of the people who used to do it back in the day kind of got back up on the machine.
264000	271000	No I didn't do it. I just wasn't really prepared to do that. So I didn't.
271000	277000	But a lot of the people that are better at dancing than I did got up there and did it and it was fun to watch.
277000	284000	So I really do hope they kind of keep pushing the freestyle thing and do it again when they're talking about doing it again.
284000	291000	I would really encourage if it's possible to maybe do stuff at conventions. That's what I'm going to kind of give them as feedback.
291000	299000	Go to conventions. If MagWest comes back see if you can't do some type of freestyle exhibition thing in the arcade at MagWest.
299000	308000	Or California Extreme or some of these other conventions. Kind of let people see film. Get the new movies out there and it'll just build up from there.
308000	315000	I did see some of you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com where we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network.
315000	321000	vognetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. I did see some of the chatters in the Twitch room.
321000	329000	So I know y'all are getting around so that's good. I'm reading chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
329000	334000	Dar Tetsuya said Rob's American Idol reference makes me think of the only other DDR tournament I ever entered.
334000	342000	Mel B did a really good Randy Jackson. Yes. Well back when freestyle was first starting American Idol had just started.
342000	352000	So a lot of those jokes weren't really tired yet. Bobby Black Wolf asks where was the Rob exhibition? About 30 pounds ago.
352000	360000	Let's see. S.G.O. 100 Matt says I watched it after the fact. Well yep that's the great thing about archives you can watch whenever you want.
360000	367000	And S.G.O. 100 Matt continues it's funny that so many of my West Coast friends were at that tournament. Yeah honestly that was the best part.
367000	377000	It really was with seeing all these people I hadn't seen in years. Like oh hey you got married and have kids now and oh hey I haven't seen you in like actually like 10 years.
377000	386000	Even though we follow each other on Twitter we only maybe live two hours apart. I actually joked to somebody I said this is like the high school reunion that I want to go to.
386000	393000	That's what yesterday really felt like was like this is the high school reunion I want to go to but then it's like you're mixed in with the current class.
394000	406000	But it was good it was good getting to see the future and the past and I guess the present as well of DDR freestyle and it's it's really neat seeing this whole DDR thing kind of getting a bit of a renaissance.
406000	414000	Like you know I have to be honest I have nothing but respect for the people that are doing Perfect Attack and doing those tournaments and I know there's great talent over there.
414000	423000	But the reality is it's really hard for me to follow because it's like I I'm not at a stamina or physical level where I can do that anymore. You know.
423000	437000	Yeah I completely understand. I know we'll get to that in a minute. But the freestyle stuff I mean not that I don't know if I could get in that but there's there's a showmanship and there's a showing us the freestyle stuff that's very very you know attracting.
437000	444000	There was people that the nice thing about round one it has like all these like glass fronts around the building. So there were people in the DDR machines right in the front.
444000	453000	So like there were these people that were randomly shopping in the mall and they'd be kind of looking through the glass and suddenly they're peering through the glass like it's those old Mervyn's commercials open open open right.
453000	465000	Yes the whole thing. And then like apparently as I understand it when there would be cheering and clapping because somebody did an awesome like leg drop or something like the people downstairs shopping at Macy's or some shit would be like turning around like what the hell's going on up there type of thing.
465000	485000	So it was cool that it got that attention from you know normals. So now looking for more comments over at chat live dot vog network dot com dark to see and chat says yeah that's what I said I lost count of the times I heard I count the times I said wow I haven't heard that name in years.
485000	500000	Let's see. Bobby says if I wasn't watching on my PS4 I would have chatted more. I think all I did was press F to pay respects once. Was that what was the joke. Was that when the maple syrup fell over. I don't know if you guys saw that. I don't think that made the stream.
500000	513000	But why was there maple syrup involved in this tournament. So Captain Canada. Do you remember that name from back in the day. I vaguely remember that. Well he was one of the guys that organized this tournament. He did one of the exhibitions and he went all out and he did.
513000	528000	He did maple syrup shots before getting up on there and then he had his big instead of like the Avengers Captain America shield there's like a Canadian version with a maple leaf. Yes. And then I don't know why but I don't remember his handle from back in the day Ryan.
528000	537000	I don't know what his handle was was sitting in there in the audience with a make America great again hat and was like booing and screaming and then like at the end of the routine Captain Canada kicked his ass.
538000	549000	And it was it was funny like it was it's one of those like you had to be there was really far you had to be on Twitch. It was funny I got a kick out of it and it was yeah it was fun to watch but that's why there was maple syrup at this tournament.
549000	560000	Okay. Why not Loki. Why not. Because maple syrup and dance pads. It's just like no. Yeah. Yeah. And when it spilled away somebody better clean that up quick. Oh my gosh.
560000	576000	Orange right asks is it archived. Yeah it's archived the Twitch name is which is funny I think it's Captain Canada's Twitch but his Twitch name is Gabby J like the super punch out. I think it's Gabby underscore J and all the archives are there I was watching some of it like briefly very briefly earlier.
577000	594000	S 200 Matt in chat also says so your first impressions around one Rob I've actually been before that was not my first time around when I've actually been several times the one in San Jose I've been to four or five times the one in Concord just as many so yeah I actually I sadly didn't play a lot.
594000	607000	Should we get one over here. Oh here in SAC. There's rumors that they are looking at it. So we'll see. I mean rumors are rumors but they're out there that it may go in South Sacramento of all places.
607000	617000	So and I'm thinking it's probably the new Delta shores still has some space to try to fill up so that might be where they're looking to put in it which would be very interesting. So we'll see. I mean I would I would love it.
617000	629000	But yeah they're growing they are opening more of them so I hope they do make their way to Sacramento. That'd be rad. But in the meantime a trip to a trip to almost said Chico a trip to Concord isn't that bad to go to round one.
629000	639000	So it's only about an hour. So OK. So there are some DDR that happened yesterday and I do just want to make sure I give snaps to all the organizers and all the people that participated getting up there and do their thing.
639000	651000	So yeah it was great. Thanks. Thank you for creating the high school reunion. I was happy to go to as opposed to the one I literally took a nap instead of going to Loki.
651000	662000	Yes. So you've also had a busy week when it comes to dance dance revolution. Yeah. We're throwing it back to episode one. Hell yeah a little bit. Yeah. So OK. So what happened in your world this week. So why didn't you make the tournament.
662000	676000	Well it's actually well even as far as last week. So last week I went and looked at a dance dance revolution machine that a private seller was selling and I made the decision to purchase said machine.
676000	689000	So yesterday I got a U-Haul truck went up there with a couple of friends and we went and brought the machine back to my garage. So now I am the owner of a dance dance revolution extreme machine.
689000	702000	Living the dream 16 years later owning a DDR. I know it's just it's ridiculous. So apparently from what I get from what the seller said he said that it originally came from the Santa Cruz beach boardwalk.
702000	712000	I thought it was from their arcade but I don't think it was. It may have been actually on the boardwalk somewhere. Oh interesting. It is a little sun faded on the like marquee and stuff.
712000	723000	Yeah. It was a third Korean machine I think that got bootleg upgraded to downgrade that shit. You know I think it got upgraded to an extreme because the market you go backwards.
723000	738000	Well it is fucking rad if it's bootleg. It's maybe if it's bootleg you can usually they have. Now you can get a DVD drive and hook it up to it and they have what's called a super disk that has 12 mixes on it.
739000	750000	I'm assuming third cream is one of them. So you could do some of that stuff. But yeah or fourth mix with the Korean stuff. I would accept that as well.
750000	760000	I've got all I've got a lot of DDR mix CDs and cassettes so like I have I used to collect those back when I was trying to rip songs and stuff from.
760000	768000	So I have like fourth mix fifth mix. I'm sure I've got Mac. Do you know why you need a third Korean. Do you know why you need a third Korean.
775000	787000	The song is so good. So good. Actually a lot of the Korean songs. There's a lot of my favorite. Originally. So I think that's what it was supposed to be. So it was he said it was a Korean cab.
788000	804000	But I don't know. So whatever it was there it ended up in a cellar or an owner in Antioch for a while. And then the guy bought it who he has this huge arcade collection like three rooms full of like 19 cabinets and stuff.
804000	818000	And he's got like a police 9 1 1 machine and like gauntlet dark legacy and area 51 and a bunch of Star Wars pinball machines and stuff. And so he wants to get more machines but there's this thing takes a way too much room.
818000	825000	So he's getting rid of that and a bunch of other machines to make room for that. You know he can talk to about changing the mix on your machine.
825000	837000	Our guest from last week because he's he he has he has the fully realized garage arcade dream. Now is it. But you've said this is not a start to like. No. My wife is not happy.
837000	847000	How is how is the wife dealing with this because that was my first thing was like how did Loki convince the wife. This is I asked. She said yes reluctantly but I'll take it.
848000	866000	It was still yes. So yes. So no it's so like I said you know I it's in the garage. It's not really taking up space in the house. I know she wanted to park her car in the garage. It's the garage is not ready to park a car in yet. And honestly the way I set it up you can park a car in the garage still.
866000	882000	It's so we just small car. Well one car. I mean we just need to I'm I put it facing my garage door instead of facing sideways like you would think against the wall for a couple of reasons one so that I can get into the back if I want to to do work on it or whatever.
882000	894000	And two it's narrower with wise than it is length. So I just went ahead and put it that way so that if when I do clean up the garage you can park a car in there and have a deep air machine.
894000	908000	The other thing is the guy that had it before the last guy he put it in an LCD screen. So it has an LCD screen instead of an actual CRT which made it a lot lighter to move because that thing fucking is heavy.
908000	919000	Yeah those are heavy cabinets. I'm sure but but also the sun fading probably impacted the old monitor that was in there and the LCD probably doesn't get affected by that or it's it got out of the sun.
920000	936000	Yeah it's yeah it's kind of rigged up. It's all right. It cuts off the bottom of the screen but it looks like I can probably adjust it. But the big thing that that's what that's important is because if down the road I want to turn it into a step mania machine.
936000	946000	It's gonna be fucking easy to do it because I'm not going to need really the hardware to convert the signal over because it's just straight VGA gotcha. So that'll be awesome.
946000	958000	How much of your machine have you actually got to play. I played for 30 minutes yesterday. Good. And like it here and there the kids have been hogging it. They've been playing as much as they can. I guess there's worse things the kids could be doing.
958000	973000	Yeah. So we put in the unlock codes because the guy that had it before me he didn't first I didn't know anything about it like he's like didn't know that there was more songs than what was initially on him like dude you know you can like change the sort and there's like a whole bunch of like hundred extra songs that you haven't seen before.
973000	983000	And I'm like and you don't even have the unlock code in here. So there's like 30 more songs that are on that. So what. I had no idea you could do that. And like when I tested it I played doubles. He's like I didn't know you could do that.
983000	1000000	Like how long have you had this machine. So he wasn't loving it. No he didn't love that machine Loki. You love that machine. Yeah. I mean it's all right. This is Loki's leg lamp.
1000000	1017000	No it's good. I mean I I couldn't. The price was great. I mean I didn't spend a lot of money on it. So it was a stroke of luck that I got it because there was other people interested in that one guy that was ahead of me because of what I said OK yeah I want to get it.
1017000	1026000	Or can I look at it. He's like OK well there's someone else that's interested. If they wanted them they're going to take it but they're going to see if it fits in their cabin in Lake Tahoe.
1026000	1037000	And so they came back and they're like no it doesn't fit in their cabin. So I was like whoa is this going to work out. You know and then so I went looked at it I'm like OK is this really busted.
1037000	1046000	And he's all well the only thing that's wrong with it is this lights burnt out on there. There's one of the marquee lights. No it was burnt out. Funny enough I get it home.
1046000	1064000	You know it tried changing the light bulb. No no no. It wasn't burnt out. The cord wasn't plugged in all the way. So he didn't love that machine Loki. It was neglected. It was fine. I mean there's other things that need to be fixed on it like some but like one of the push buttons needs to be the thing needs to be replaced.
1065000	1079000	I can do that super easy. And then the pads on the left hand side are not sensitive anymore. So like I fail songs on the left side but when I play on the right side I don't fail those songs. So it's there are sensors that need to be replaced or tweaks.
1079000	1089000	I'm going to do the foam pad modification to it to make it more sensitive to see if that'll fix it. If not just replace the sensors in it. And then the marquee.
1089000	1104000	It looks like it's it. It was printed out and I think it's got water damage to it because it looks all weird. I mean it's fine but do you want a DDR second mix Mark. No I don't know. I'm good. We have one hanging in the studio for those that we have a DDR second mix marquee.
1104000	1123000	I don't need a second. But no there's like small things. I mean it's it's it's absolutely minor for like what I'm playing. I can't. I'm not trying to triple a song right now. There's no fucking way that's going to happen. I'm like I got to go back to playing single pad you know single pad stuff for the six.
1123000	1133000	You know that's because I am just out of shape. So it's a really good thing. I mean this is the one plus about me not owning a home like I know that's supposed to be the American dream and all and Loki owns a home.
1133000	1145000	Our soccer owns a home. I don't own a home but I do worry if I did own the home I'd be filling it up with all this shit like even worse than both of you. And she has like nine pinball machines.
1145000	1163000	And now you have a DDR machine. I'm the only one. You know what I have two little classic arcade machines that I bought at what are the Jamie bought me at Wal-Mart because I wanted them and that I have since put the official in this last week the pop vinyl RuPaul's drag race collection on top of.
1163000	1171000	So when you walk into my house in the garage you now see drag queens and video games and it's like it me someday someday.
1171000	1184000	Yeah I know something like a 2D X or something. Yeah. Oh don't tease me. Be fun. Yeah. All right. So when's the big party. When are we all coming over to play. I guess come over whenever you want. Nice.
1184000	1197000	I'll be there tomorrow. No just kidding. We'll figure something out. I'll be fun. Yeah. Well we should do like a live stream from your garage. Some point they'll be fine. Thankfully like all the shots that we have in the garage right now have been the clean side because everything's pushed to the other side.
1198000	1210000	Have you seen my office where I do my twitch broadcast from it's like there's the one little clean bubble and then there's just stuff everywhere. It's it's fine to tell that television is an illusion Loki.
1211000	1228000	So it's I honestly it's not that cluttered. It's just it's video game stuff that's in there. I've got my like rock band stuff. I've got boxes of equipment I had from one I had. We had a game room set up at my old work so I've got like all the cables and stuff for that and just like parts and things.
1228000	1244000	So if it's something I can get cleaned up out of there it's just right now I haven't gotten a chance to but I we're doing like Loki I am not one to judge over a messy home. I'm really really not. So I know your garage can have as much crap this way like all the minor things aside.
1244000	1262000	I don't fucking care because this is your machine. It fucking works. It's not broken as like this stuff and it's yours. No seriously the stuff I was looking at at that price before was like it was a broken broken techno motion machine that need a ton of work and like monitor was missing and stuff like that.
1262000	1272000	This is a machine that's actually in great. I think it's been pretty great condition just neglected it just minor shit. I mean I can deal with minor shit. That's fine.
1273000	1285000	So all right. Well I still Loki I just I'm going to throw this out there. The biggest regret for me personally this goes back to the whole where's Rob's arcade was when I saw that Burger Time machine at the Roseville auction. I didn't buy it.
1285000	1293000	That's that's my biggest regret in life. I try not to have many regrets but not buying that Burger Time machine is one of them. So I'm glad you fully realized your dream Loki.
1294000	1309000	I mean yeah this is pretty much the end game. So like my wife's like well what the next thing it's just going to be bigger and bigger and bigger. I'm like no this is what I wanted. Like when I built it when I built the first arcade cabinet was to convert into a DVR machine when I got the candy cab is to make a DVR machine.
1310000	1320000	It's like it's always been to make a DVR machine. I have a DVR machine. Don't need to make a DVR machine. There it is. There it is. It's done. There it is. Now you just have to you know make a game. Now. Yeah.
1321000	1329000	All right. We're going to move on. That was a lot of DVR talk. But the good kind you know is good. It's been been a long time since we were a DVR focused show.
1330000	1336000	Memories. All right. Let's talk about the actual kickoff topic we were supposed to talk about tonight because we are all about all types of video games.
1337000	1351000	Loki's give it give us a new story here to start us off. So about Facebook. Yeah. So Facebook's trying to get into the game streaming business. So you know they're working on creating a competitor to like twitch or like maybe YouTube gaming.
1351000	1359000	They're saying that right now they're exploring different options for monetization leaving out mixer as a competitor shade button.
1361000	1363000	Just just just an observation. Go ahead.
1364000	1382000	Well they're saying that you know I guess the they have a pilot program they're playing on using I guess the existing technology that Facebook has and they said they also wanted to use the Oculus as one of their streaming platforms using like for VR games or something like that.
1382000	1401000	So it's interesting. However though I'm still a little concerned because you know Facebook does you know apparently has the exclusive streaming rights for the ESL and broadcasting the Dota 2 stuff and apparently wasn't all that great.
1401000	1419000	And on top of that you know they've been kind of doing a smackdown on people that have been broadcasting on their own on Twitch because you know like in TV you know certain channels get the rights to exclusive rights to broadcast like the NFL or you know NBA or stuff like that.
1419000	1436000	And so because this is the Internet it's still not really different in that respect. However it's kind of conflicting based off of what they've said before where oh yeah anybody can broadcast these you know Dota TV things but so some people are not happy that their channels have gotten banned.
1436000	1449000	But you just can't do it to a competitor either. Yeah. Yeah. So because they really don't like it when you stream like NFL games or the worst is the pay per view events like don't don't try streaming those to Twitch. You will get banned for that and it's not good.
1449000	1457000	Yeah. So apparently like they have like some screenshots of like what it looked like. It was just looks like a garbled mess.
1457000	1473000	Well I thought Facebook kind of did some game streaming as it is. I know especially with Blizzard they have the Facebook stuff built in there and once in a great while I will see friends streaming maybe like Overwatch or Heroes of the Storm or something on to Facebook.
1473000	1500000	But I don't think that's really maybe caught on as big as Facebook would hope. It's kind of it's like right in the middle of the feed with oh so and so's recent cat picture and so and so's moral outrage about something like Facebook like their feet is jacked up if you're not using like some sort of external thing to fix it because like I'll go and find something it's like oh hey that's pretty cool and I'll scroll down the screen or something and scroll back up and it's like oh now it reshuffled everything and now that story is gone.
1500000	1521000	It's like great. So I mean they need I think if they're going to do a streaming platform that they need to separate it off like another section of you know streaming or gaming or something like that that's like completely separate that you can find all that because just finding your feet is going to be really hard to engage in people and if they want to like do it like twitch.
1522000	1548000	Discover abilities a huge part of why I think which has been so successful is that you know it's it's pretty easy to you know categorize what you're doing and have the ability to be discovered especially since twitch launched the community thing and I really wish they integrate the community thing better into the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one versions of the app but it's probably just not their highest priority right now.
1548000	1571000	But yeah discover abilities really big on twitch and to as much as I hit the shade button on mixer earlier you know I still think mixer as a platform from a technological standpoint has a lot of awesome stuff like I love that you get the credits for watching things and I think the discover ability in some ways and mixer is is actually almost a little better because mixer really likes to feature up and comers in a particular section of their website as well.
1571000	1590000	It's just that mixer hasn't caught that wave yet you know it doesn't have everybody on a lot of big names so they're not honestly like with twitch I don't really go to twitch to watch anything like it's not like a YouTube or anything like that for me it's more of what is better than YouTube for me YouTube's at the bottom of the barrel for me but that's me personally.
1590000	1615000	Well I don't really watch live streams I mean I watch pre tape live streams I guess but I don't watch a ton of live streams on YouTube but for me it's like I won't go to twitch unless I'm watching like you know awesome games done quick or something like that that I know is going to be there you know it's not like I'm going to go watch somebody on twitch I don't really have anybody I follow that broadcasts really frequently on twitch.
1615000	1644000	Over in chat at live.vognetwork.com actdef says I know people that stream games on Facebook how how do they did what do they get out of it do they just like to show off to their friends or are they getting discovered by others or I mean are they happy with it I guess I guess if they're still doing it they are but I'm kind of curious about that actdef and looking at some other comments over at live.vognetwork.com fantaz in chat says people actually watch mixer I know they do I'm just being shady and it is it is integrated integrated well.
1644000	1663000	Into the Xbox one obviously you would hope that it is and I do appreciate that even though Microsoft has mixer they haven't tried to be shady about like blocking twitch or YouTube or other ways to do it I do appreciate and applaud Microsoft for not being shitty about that if that makes sense.
1663000	1680000	Oh and the other thing I think is really cool about mixer that I thought twitch would have stolen by now but is the whole co streaming where you do the the multiple points of view all at once I mean it can get a little chaotic with the audio but I think if you know you do it right like those could be a lot of fun to I would like to do more.
1680000	1689000	They should do the audio similar to how they did it with awesome games done quick where they have like you know this one has the audio source the rest are just you know video.
1689000	1705000	actdef in chat points out their fan pages it's a regional gaming group and have streams for Xbox and Nintendo stuff Tigerclaw in chat says you can stream games on Periscope I didn't I didn't realize that I mean it makes sense I kind of forgot about Periscope.
1705000	1706000	Yeah.
1706000	1707000	But anyway.
1707000	1708000	All right.
1708000	1727000	So we'll see how Facebook does with this again I have concerns I just I think Facebook's trying to get its hands in a lot of pots and I think there's a there's an interesting I think kind of backlash coming for Facebook I mean we all we all have those couple friends of ours that have deleted their accounts by now if you're not one of them.
1727000	1739000	I'm sure we have listeners who left Facebook a long time ago or don't use it because you know there is a lot of crap on there and there's a lot of you know weird social interactions that happened there that don't happen in real life.
1739000	1749000	What I mean is people leave comments to other people you wouldn't say to somebody's face in real life and I think a lot of people are starting to realize that some of that on Facebook is kind of toxic in a way.
1749000	1750000	Yeah.
1750000	1756000	And you know what was it Tim Cook had recently said Tim Cook is what you know the CEO of Apple.
1756000	1759000	He said he wouldn't let his nephew use social media or something like that.
1759000	1760000	I mean that's pretty bad.
1760000	1771000	And one of the guys that used to work at Facebook has kind of expressed regret for some of the stuff like some of these tech giants are starting to come out and say maybe maybe the monster we built.
1771000	1776000	Maybe what was it called in Terminator maybe that this wasn't such a good idea after all.
1776000	1777000	Cyberdyne.
1777000	1781000	Cyberdyne yeah maybe maybe face face a dyne wasn't the best idea after all.
1781000	1784000	So or what was it.
1784000	1788000	No it wasn't the site it was cyber dyne was the name of the company it was.
1788000	1795000	Why can't I remember somebody and somebody in chat will remember over at live dog and network dot com dungeon bus guy next guy.
1796000	1797000	Yes guy that is.
1797000	1799000	Took me a sec.
1799000	1801000	That's that's the beauty of having a live chat room.
1801000	1806000	They're here to correct us when our old brains can't remember from a movie from there's a lot of knowledge up there.
1806000	1812000	So I think sometimes pushes out the it knows how to fix the DDR machine but it forgot about Skynet.
1812000	1814000	All right.
1814000	1821000	Anyway let's get into talking a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.
1821000	1822000	Loki I'll start with you.
1822000	1823000	How was your gaming week.
1823000	1828000	So aside from I did play a little bit DDR extreme obviously.
1828000	1830000	So I played you know quite a few songs.
1830000	1839000	It's funny like going back and playing that like there's a lot of songs I'm like I didn't remember that being on DDR extreme like I thought that they got rid of that song after Max 2 or something.
1839000	1842000	You know there's a lot of like crossover songs that I was like oh yeah.
1842000	1843000	Was that on there.
1843000	1845000	I thought that wasn't on there.
1845000	1849000	So that's kind of interesting just to go back and see all that stuff.
1849000	1865000	But yeah I'm trying my goal is to play at least 30 minutes a day that you know for exercise because and honestly right now that's about all I can handle which is it's sad that I've gotten to this point but I mean I've got it.
1865000	1872000	This is one of the reasons why I got a DDR machines because it's no I know it's something that I would be able to stick with.
1872000	1878000	So that's the whole point is just exercise in any exercise better than no exercise.
1878000	1890000	So that's my goal is to work on that and hopefully be able to actually play more like I used to maybe after a year or two of doing that.
1890000	1892000	And then of course you know non DDR stuff.
1892000	1903000	I did play well still kind of DDR related I played some step mania because I downloaded on my PC just to kind of mess around with and that's so fun.
1903000	1904000	Non DDR related stuff.
1904000	1912000	I've been playing Stardew Valley still and it's all right.
1912000	1917000	I don't know. It's just a grind but at least it's it seems like it's somewhat entertaining.
1917000	1936000	It's for me it seems like it's a good mix of like almost Animal Crossing with Minecraft and I guess maybe Harvest Moon but I've never played Harvest Moon so it's just I don't know it's entertaining or relaxing I guess it's not a whole lot to it.
1936000	1939000	So I've been doing that and then.
1939000	1944000	I don't know that's it. I haven't really been playing too many mobile games this week either.
1944000	1948000	All right. Let's see over. I want to respond to this at live dot vog network dot com.
1948000	1954000	Going back just a little bit but S.H.A. 100 Matt in chat says I stream last night but only one person came to watch.
1954000	1958000	I kind of stream so infrequently that I understand if I don't get too many viewers.
1958000	1960000	But to be honest I don't do it for views.
1960000	1965000	I mostly want to do it to share the things that I like with my friends and like minded folks.
1965000	1973000	You're in the right mindset S.H.A. 100 Matt. If you get into anything regarding content creation expecting to make 500 views out the gate.
1973000	1978000	You're only going to be disappointed. Like let me tell you from having done this show for 15 years.
1978000	1981000	There have been episodes where we have six listeners.
1981000	1988000	There have been episodes where we had six thousand listeners and it's gone up and down and all around over the years.
1988000	1991000	You know we've been kind of fortunate to see both sides of it all.
1991000	1998000	But at the end of the day here doing OLR it's really about you know you guys the loyal folks that we have showing up every Sunday.
1998000	2003000	Getting to hang out with Loki and Jamie and just like kind of putting the content out there I think kind of all comes together.
2003000	2007000	We just do it because it's fun. It's a thing to do on Sunday. Exactly. Exactly.
2007000	2011000	So that's and I know that's kind of where your mind is that S.H.A. 100 Matt but I'm kind of sharing this for everybody.
2011000	2018000	But if you want to like grow your audience I think one of the easiest best ways to do that especially on Twitch is support other people.
2018000	2022000	You know what I mean by that is follow other accounts.
2022000	2028000	You know even if you can only host your one viewer when you're done for somebody else do it because people will recognize that stuff.
2028000	2035000	And then you know you make other friends that broadcast maybe one of these days when they're done with a stream they'll send their viewers to you.
2035000	2043000	You guys might remember you know I don't I don't have a huge Twitch presence because my main focus has been on podcasting and I've kept trying and trying to do the Twitch thing.
2043000	2049000	But it's gone back to doing three podcasts a week which is you know that's that's a lot of my time. I'm very happy with it.
2049000	2054000	I feel like I'm creating a variety of content again which was something that was really missing from last year.
2054000	2058000	So you know I'm I'm happy but I don't have a huge audience on Twitch and that's OK.
2058000	2061000	But you guys might remember one night after the show I was doing Cuphead right.
2061000	2067000	And some random guy playing Cuphead dumped 73 viewers on me like you know at one point which is a lot of viewers for my stream.
2067000	2075000	So you just never know when something's going to hit. But a big part of it is just like getting out there doing it doing it regularly supporting other people.
2075000	2081000	At some point you will be noticed and that one viewer may turn into five viewers which may not seem like a huge number.
2081000	2087000	But it's five times what you had before. Yeah. So you know it'll it'll happen.
2087000	2094000	Just keep at it. And I you know I kind of have to remind myself of this advice too because I've been very bad about doing the Twitch thing regularly.
2094000	2101000	But you know I've chosen to stick more with podcasts is what I what's what I know it's what I'm I think I'm good at.
2101000	2111000	So you know and I feel really good about what's going on with here with what I do for our reading is fundamental even though I'm you know not the producer of that show I feel good about what I'm contributing there.
2111000	2114000	And then shaking and crying which you know I promoted on the show last week.
2114000	2120000	I just I'm having great feelings about that show. It's really really good to be doing that show with Victoria and I've gotten some good feedback on that.
2120000	2124000	So yeah.
2124000	2131000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry radio at vog network dot com use the pass phrase root.
2131000	2136000	I guess I kind of got on a tangent there but that's OK. That was an important comment over at live dot vog network dot com.
2136000	2140000	I'm also trying to catch up on other chats over at live dot vog network dot com.
2140000	2146000	Act-deft in chat says the same happens for me and my podcast. We don't get more than like 20 views on YouTube.
2147000	2157000	But I like talking about stuff. Well you know what 20 people would still fill a small room that's still like a well attended meeting.
2157000	2163000	You know so that's that's pretty good. You know 20 is nothing to be ashamed of whatsoever.
2163000	2171000	You know find find the find the joy in the small audiences and it sounds like you do. I'm just you know reiterating that for maybe people who don't.
2171000	2177000	Let's see over at chat live dot vog network dot com. Act-deft points out GFM cast.
2177000	2183000	It's in Spanish. Hence why I don't really promote here that much. Well hey if we have Spanish speakers out there go to GFM cast.
2183000	2190000	There you go. Free plug. There you go. That's that's how knowing people will help out sometimes.
2190000	2197000	Bobby Black Wolf says that's more people than attended some of vog's dragon con panels. 20 people.
2197000	2204000	That's absolutely right. That's absolutely right. We've had less people that show up in person for a vog panel and it happens.
2204000	2211000	We still did the best panel we could and we had a lot of fun and we may have been sober or not but we had a really good time.
2211000	2217000	So I always have a great time at Dragon Con. OK. My gaming week over at live dot vog network dot com.
2217000	2223000	In chat if you want to chat along with the show. Honestly see my gaming week wasn't really that spectacular.
2223000	2227000	All the usual suspects right. Y'all know I play Ingress and Pokemon Go all the time. That's no surprise.
2227000	2233000	Final Fantasy 14 I've kind of been ramping more and more because there's a big patch that comes out on Tuesday.
2233000	2239000	And like I mentioned a few weeks ago I moved servers which was you know it was a it was a hard change.
2239000	2248000	But you know I'm trying to take in the whole like OK new people I'm playing with I haven't got to play with before so I can kind of go do new stuff.
2248000	2255000	So you know kind of been enjoying that type of thing. And yeah still Heroes of the Storm. Quite a bit of that.
2255000	2263000	I just I try to do my matches every day. I just bought Hanzo today who's more fun to play in Heroes of the Storm than he is in Overwatch in my opinion.
2263000	2269000	But that's just my opinion. Played a little bit of Overwatch because I wanted to do that cosmetic update that just happened.
2269000	2275000	And I had to buy Pharah's new skin. Like and I actually had the currency to do it so I was really happy so I got Pharah's new skin.
2275000	2279000	So yay. Alright. So that's really my gaming week. That was really it.
2279000	2281000	Did you play anything at round one?
2281000	2283000	No. Is that weird?
2283000	2284000	That is weird.
2284000	2288000	There was just so many people there that obviously all the music games were like taken over.
2288000	2293000	And I didn't really want to play the ticket games or the crane games and I just I don't know I thought about playing theater with them.
2293000	2300000	But then it's like when I would kind of look over there then it's like oh there's that person I haven't seen in like five years and so I just didn't get around to it.
2301000	2306000	I did go to Daiso and I bought a ton of candy so you know I did something while I was at the mall.
2306000	2312000	And the mall actually had the RuPaul's Drag Race pop vinyls in stock whereas it was all sold out here.
2312000	2318000	So thank you to DDR Freestyle Takeover for getting me to that mall where these were actually in stock.
2319000	2322000	So there's that. Let's see.
2322000	2325000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2325000	2328000	SHG100Matt says I want to get Widowmaker's new skin.
2328000	2332000	Fantaz says I'm wondering if it's finally time for me to buy Overwatch yet.
2332000	2334000	Have made some new friends that play it.
2334000	2342000	I think Overwatch is a great game and it's you know they're what's really good about it is that Blizzard hasn't just shut it down after a year.
2342000	2345000	They're still adding to it. They're still investing in it.
2345000	2348000	So you know I think I think there's a lot there.
2348000	2352000	Overwatch has those free weekends pretty regularly.
2352000	2355000	Like it feels like it's almost once a month or once every other month at this point.
2355000	2361000	So if you're really not sure wait for one of those free weekends and then you can play with your friends.
2361000	2365000	And hopefully you'll have a good experience and then maybe you'll decide to buy the game.
2365000	2368000	I feel like it's on sale a lot these days too.
2368000	2372000	So you know the price of getting in the door is not as high as it was.
2373000	2375000	Alright.
2375000	2379000	Also Fantaz make sure you know what platform your friends are on though.
2379000	2383000	Because I'm sure you're already aware but PC not cross platform with PlayStation 4.
2383000	2385000	Not cross platform with Xbox One.
2385000	2389000	So that's why I have the game on both PC and PlayStation 4.
2389000	2392000	Because I have friends that pretty much only play on PlayStation 4.
2392000	2394000	And I have friends that pretty much only play on PC.
2394000	2398000	Truth be told I don't get on PlayStation 4 a lot and play with my friends.
2398000	2400000	I kind of tend to gravitate to PC.
2400000	2405000	But that's only because when it comes to shooters these days I kind of prefer keyboard and mouse.
2405000	2410000	It's weird when it's Halo I prefer controller but I feel like Halo was made for controller.
2410000	2416000	And Overwatch was probably made for PC and then kind of like backed into controller if that makes sense.
2416000	2421000	But I know some people that play Overwatch that swear by controller so you do what works for you.
2421000	2423000	It ain't always about me.
2423000	2427000	I only play the controller because I never got into the keyboard and mouse.
2427000	2429000	It's like the only way I can do it.
2429000	2433000	I know and playing controller on PC is probably really dumb.
2434000	2437000	I have a laptop. I have no place to put a mouse.
2437000	2439000	You're not the only one that does it.
2439000	2442000	I know for a fact you're not the only one that's plugged controller in the PC and done it that way.
2442000	2445000	I think you're putting yourself at a disadvantage but...
2445000	2448000	I don't play competitively. Well actually I don't play at all right now but you know.
2448000	2451000	I wasn't playing competitively to begin with.
2451000	2457000	But like if you know that you're going to fumble with keyboard and mouse and you're better with controller then is it really a hit or miss?
2457000	2459000	Yeah I know because I'm not used to it at all.
2459000	2462000	I mean I was trying to think back when I used to play Duke Nukem and stuff.
2462000	2465000	I'm like that was all keyboard. There was no mouse.
2465000	2467000	It was just straight up just keyboard.
2467000	2469000	So I'm like how the fuck did I do that?
2469000	2474000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat at live.vognetwork.com says it's time the car is controller only confirmed.
2474000	2477000	No I had keyboard stuff as well.
2477000	2480000	A designer has to consider all elements.
2480000	2482000	So anyway.
2482000	2485000	Alright let's get to some gaming news.
2486000	2489000	I will just mention housekeeping. I don't have a lot to say except follow us on Twitter.
2489000	2491000	Twitter.com slash o-l-r. We're also on Facebook.
2491000	2493000	Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2493000	2496000	You know what I haven't plugged in a while is the Discord server.
2496000	2499000	If you're not on the Discord server you really should check it out.
2499000	2503000	It's all free. Many of y'all are using Discord for your other games anyway.
2503000	2508000	Like if you're playing Overwatch online you might just be saying screw it to Blizzard chat and using Discord.
2508000	2512000	If you're playing anything Nintendo online you're probably using Discord because Nintendo's app.
2512000	2514000	Let's be real.
2514000	2518000	So join the VOG Network Discord. It's vognetwork.com slash Discord.
2518000	2522000	And that'll keep you up to date on all the latest and greatest going on around the network.
2522000	2529000	Including new shows as they come up online from not just us but all the great shows on our network.
2529000	2535000	As well as some of the shows if they've opted in and if you're a show that wants to opt in let me know.
2535000	2537000	Have their own chat channels.
2537000	2543000	We have a channel on there and we have some folks that post stories in there that we sometimes read on the show.
2543000	2547000	I know this week we just got a new one for Anime Jam Session now has a chat room.
2547000	2550000	And Shaking and Crying, the newest VOG Network show, also has a chat room.
2550000	2552000	So that's just growing over at Discord.
2552000	2556000	So check that out. Vognetwork.com slash Discord.
2556000	2561000	Okay, let's get into gaming news. I think it's time. Loki, let's do it.
2561000	2564000	So there is a social platform that's shutting down Mitomo.
2564000	2567000	It's shutting down May 9th.
2567000	2570000	Thankfully we didn't have a Mitomo Club.
2570000	2575000	Well, I do feel bad this is coming up the week the Dark Sakura isn't here.
2575000	2582000	Because I feel if anybody can appropriately eulogize Mitomo it would be the one of us that's actually still playing it pretty regularly.
2582000	2585000	So we'll have to ask her how she's doing about it next week.
2585000	2587000	But yeah, Jamie's the big Mitomo player here.
2587000	2593000	Yeah, so basically May 9th they're going to be shutting down pretty much all the services that it relies on.
2593000	2599000	So if you try to launch the app after May 9th they'll basically let you know that you're not going to be able to use it.
2599000	2603000	It says you'll no longer be able to see your answers or messages in the app.
2603000	2609000	You can transfer your Mii character to your Nintendo account by linking it to Mitomo.
2609000	2612000	And your sidekick Mii characters will be deleted.
2612000	2617000	But you can keep your sidekick Mii characters by saving them with a QR code or something like that.
2617000	2627000	And then they say Mitomo themed icons and clothing items used in your Nintendo account or Super Mario Run game will not display after the services ended.
2627000	2634000	So, um, interesting. I'm surprised, like how long was it out? Was it a couple years or not even?
2634000	2635000	It's probably been about a year and a half.
2635000	2636000	Year and a half.
2636000	2641000	It feels like, I don't know, maybe somebody in chat knows the exact date, I don't know.
2641000	2644000	But I feel like it hasn't been a very long time. Nintendo just recently got into mobile.
2644000	2647000	And May 9th is such a weird day to do that on. It's like a Wednesday.
2647000	2650000	So is there something else coming out around that time to replace it?
2650000	2656000	It launched March 17th, 2016. So it'll actually be coming up on two years.
2656000	2658000	It'll be coming up on two years by the time they pull the plug.
2658000	2662000	Interesting. But it's weird though. I don't know.
2662000	2668000	So I guess all those Mitomo coins or whatever that you earn in that, you can't redeem on your Nintendo account.
2668000	2671000	No more platinum coins. That's dumb.
2671000	2675000	ActDeftInChat says, I still play Mitomo and makes a little face with that.
2675000	2679000	It sucks that all the features from Mitomo will not work after May.
2679000	2682000	I'm gonna miss taking me photos and dressing up my Mii.
2682000	2692000	Yeah, I see a lot of people still use, like when I do see Mitomo, it's people using the little Mitomo picture generator with their phone camera to do AR type of pictures.
2692000	2695000	I guess for lack of a better way of saying it.
2695000	2698000	That's kind of where I see that feature used the most now.
2698000	2702000	I wonder if they're coming out with something else to replace it then.
2702000	2711000	I don't know, Loki. I think this just might be a sign that Nintendo's mobile ventures have not been doing as well as hope.
2711000	2717000	I didn't play this. Did they have anything like any sort of premium content that you had to purchase in there?
2717000	2718000	All those costumes.
2718000	2719000	All the costumes?
2719000	2725000	Oh yeah. I mean, you could earn some in-game currency like slowly and you got your rewards for logging in.
2725000	2734000	Remember Mitomo, I don't know if you know, it had like the little pachinko type thing where you could do the drop and then the drops have some of those premium items in them.
2734000	2737000	And so you could pay currency to get more of the drops.
2737000	2742000	But you could also earn, you know, kind of slowly through in-game methods as well as the way most mobile games work.
2742000	2750000	It's either pay to speed it up or, you know, earn it slowly through answering questions, getting people to like your posts, those types of things.
2750000	2759000	That's the other thing about Mitomo. It wasn't much of a game as it was like a social experiment. I don't know what else to label it.
2759000	2765000	The closest thing it really came to was Tomodachi Life, which isn't much of a game either.
2765000	2771000	In fact, in my opinion, and some will disagree and disagree strongly, but in my opinion, Tomodachi Life is a terrible game.
2771000	2777000	It's made some great memes online and so forth, but I think it's just a dumb 3DS app.
2777000	2784000	To me, it seemed like those games were even less involved than the free 3DS games that they have included in the 3DS.
2784000	2789000	Like the little RPG and stuff that you get with the coins that you would earn.
2791000	2800000	So it's, I mean, there's going to be people out there who are really mad that they're basically losing what they spent their premium coins on after only two years, but...
2800000	2802000	Yeah, so that's any digital thing.
2802000	2806000	Right? That's the tricky thing. That's really any digital thing in this day and age.
2806000	2810000	Someday, Loki, there isn't going to be Ingress anymore.
2810000	2814000	Which probably would be a better thing for my health and the health of some people I know.
2814000	2818000	But someday, Loki, there's not going to be a Pokémon GO anymore.
2818000	2824000	And that's going to be personally upsetting because I've really not spent that much money on Ingress, all things said and done.
2824000	2830000	I mean, maybe on the physical stuff that ties to Ingress, like the sweatshirt I own and things like that.
2830000	2833000	But in the game itself, I've barely spent money.
2833000	2839000	But in Pokémon GO, I don't want to talk about it. We already talked about it a few weeks ago on the show and I'm not going back there.
2839000	2841000	I've spent more than I care to admit again.
2841000	2844000	And so inevitably, Pokémon GO will go away.
2844000	2847000	I think Pokémon GO is going to last longer than two years.
2847000	2849000	You know, it's still doing very well.
2849000	2856000	But you just have to look at the amount of time that you spent playing the game versus the amount of money that you dropped into it and whether that was worth it or not.
2856000	2865000	Which it probably was. I mean, you spent hours playing the game and I'm sure that the cost per hour is pretty small.
2865000	2868000	And that's kind of what I have to remember. You're right.
2868000	2874000	Sometimes, Loki, it's not about the Pokémon we caught, but it's about the friends we made along the way.
2874000	2878000	And, you know, I have met new people playing Pokémon GO.
2878000	2883000	I went out and did a walk around Capitol Park for three hours on Community Day.
2883000	2888000	And that's probably not something I would have done if Pokémon GO didn't exist.
2888000	2898000	So, you're right. That's the only way I'm going to be able to kind of cope when these games inevitably shut down is, well, at least I did all this other shit that would have never happened if it wasn't for those games.
2898000	2901000	Now, can I say that about Miitomo?
2901000	2903000	No.
2903000	2912000	Most of the people I talk to on Miitomo, all of the people I talk to on Miitomo, are people that were connected through my Facebook or my Twitter account anyway.
2912000	2919000	Which, if I want to post status updates and answer questions, those are probably better platforms for me to be using.
2919000	2923000	The only thing Miitomo gave me that those platforms didn't give me was Virtual Barbie and Ken.
2923000	2932000	And Room Designer, which I know they added to Miitomo later on, and some of the other design features, you know, that don't really exist on those other platforms.
2932000	2936000	So, that's what Facebook needs to get into. Forget this whole game broadcasting thing.
2937000	2941000	They need to take PlayStation home and put it on Facebook.
2941000	2943000	Well, they do have Oculus.
2943000	2946000	There you go. VRChat coming soon to Facebook.
2946000	2948000	Oh God, I already have it.
2948000	2951000	No, I know, I know. So, coming soon there.
2951000	2954000	Yeah, VRChat is slowly working its way to Second Life.
2954000	2965000	Speaking of games that are going under, Phantasm Chat, and I don't think this is on the show anywhere else, Phantasm Chat over at live.vognetwork.com also brings up Rest in Peace Paragon.
2965000	2969000	Yeah, that was just announced this past week, too, that Paragon is getting shut down.
2969000	2976000	And I'm just assuming because Fortnite is where the money's at right now, and everybody's, they're just reallocating their resources there.
2976000	2983000	Like, this is the game that's making waves, and Paragon wasn't, so see you later, Paragon.
2983000	2986000	It's kind of sad for the loyalists that were playing that Paragon game.
2986000	2994000	I checked it out once or twice on PlayStation 4, but I didn't think it was as good as Overwatch.
2994000	2998000	It just wasn't. I'm sorry. I know there's fans of that game. It didn't feel as polished.
2998000	3004000	The heroes didn't make sense in the same way, but maybe I'm trying to apply Overwatch logic to Paragon, it just didn't really work.
3004000	3008000	So, but I do, I have played Fortnite, and I do like, I do like that.
3008000	3016000	I tried the Battle Royale-esque thing in Fortnite, and that was, that was fun for a little bit, and then I kind of realized I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.
3016000	3018000	So I just need to keep trying, I guess.
3018000	3022000	Well, I guess now, if you want to play with Paragon, you just have to play more Diablo 3.
3023000	3028000	Alright. Anyway, let's move on, talking about livestreaming, as we were doing earlier.
3028000	3031000	Let's talk about Twitch, and actually, this is a big win for Twitch.
3031000	3038000	Twitch, back in 2016, took legal action against bot, or I guess, bot sellers?
3038000	3041000	Bot, view bot sellers.
3041000	3049000	So, basically, if you were, if you were that comment we got earlier, that I'm only getting one viewer, and it's impossible for me to get discovered,
3049000	3056000	well, you could pay bots to come watch your stream, and help boost you up in the rankings, which I do not endorse, you should not do.
3056000	3060000	That's a terrible idea, because that type of shit just always has a way of catching up with you.
3060000	3063000	And that's kind of what happened here.
3063000	3069000	Twitch took some legal action, and some court documents were filed on January 22nd, that is shown.
3069000	3081000	A California judge ordered bot makers, Michael and Catherine and Jomy, to permanently shut down the software, and pay Twitch 1.3 million dollars.
3081000	3092000	You know where that number came from? 55,000 for damages, 1.31 million is the profits they made off the business.
3093000	3103000	Think about that for a minute. So when you hear this judgment for one point, all but 55,000 of that, 55,000, we'll say that was court fees, now the actual damages, right?
3103000	3112000	That bot made 1.3 million dollars. There's that many people out there, desperate to bump up their view counts.
3113000	3125000	I'm not trying to make anybody feel bad or anything, but I'm just trying to put myself in their shoes. I just would never pay for that.
3125000	3131000	Why would you want artificial people watching? Because they're not going to stay around.
3131000	3140000	Once the time's up, it's almost like you get addicted to it, right? It's virtual drugs. That's what it is, right? Just one hit.
3140000	3146000	I want to see what it feels like to have 100 viewers and go viral. Just one hit. And then when you stop paying, they're all gone.
3146000	3155000	And if your content wasn't engaging enough to get that stuff organically, then you're not going to keep any of those people that got fooled into subscribing to your stream.
3155000	3164000	And so you're just going to have to pay again and again and again. Virtual drugs. That's what it is. 1.3 million dollars worth of virtual drugs.
3165000	3173000	Dungeonbuster in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, views our social currency to some and they want more regardless of the cost.
3173000	3179000	And AkumaJP in chat says, throwing back to an OLR in-joke, I'll friend your butt for a fee.
3179000	3184000	That's an in-joke from OLR going back to an old YouTube video.
3184000	3193000	Kaijuto in chat says, I have no problem with them using bots. I get why Twitch is mad, but it means nothing to me if they used bots or not.
3193000	3203000	Well, I mean, I suppose at the end of the day, you're right. What they do doesn't really affect me. I mean, their artificial ranking might outrank my organic ranking.
3203000	3210000	But at the end of the day, does it really matter? Probably not. But the judge did rule in Twitch's favor legally.
3210000	3220000	Because, you know, the judge is on Twitch's side because it was trademark infringement, unfair competition, a violation of the Anti-Cyber Squatting Consumer Protection Act.
3220000	3231000	Because they had names like shoptwitch.com, twitchstreams.org, and they would provide streamers with fake viewers for up to $760 a month.
3231000	3240000	And so Twitch said it made it unfairly easy for streamers to earn money and clear the hurdle into the partner program. Oh, I didn't think of that.
3240000	3250000	That's why some people were doing this was so that they could artificially hit those milestones to get into the partner program and then dream that they're going to make all this money back now that they're in the program.
3250000	3260000	Well, it's a good thing that no other streaming platforms out there raise the requirements to get into their partner programs. So I'm sure that won't be a problem anywhere else.
3260000	3275000	No, it won't. And Twitch said it resulted in a deluge of shoddy content for its viewers, saying, quote, instead of engaging in interesting social interactions on Twitch, they may encounter bots spewing lists of random words.
3275000	3285000	So, interesting. I thought that was worth noting because I just did not realize how much money was going into that, you know what I mean?
3285000	3295000	And the fact that Twitch kind of won that. So if you are one of these people that uses these botting services, it's going to come around eventually, so don't get too used to it.
3295000	3300000	And legally, now there's precedent. Anyway, let's move on. Loki.
3300000	3312000	All right. Let's talk a little bit about Pokemon Go. So they had some new Pokemon make their way out over here. The big one being, I guess, from the Hoenn region.
3312000	3331000	So they've got, I know I saw the picture of it. Was it Camerupt, Nosepass, Trapinch, Igrond, and they're saying that even Solrock and Lunatone.
3331000	3338000	Yeah, those are the two that have these weird region rules, it seems like. So there's more regional exclusives. Hooray.
3338000	3342000	Yeah, so all in all, there was like 23 new Pokemon that were added.
3342000	3352000	I don't know about you guys and your parts of the world, but these 23 new Pokemon are not very prolific for me. I'm not seeing them as often as I see other new stuff when they release.
3352000	3364000	Like, for example, there's a Zigzagoon on the house right now. I see those all the time from Gen 3, which matches the games. They were the Rattata trashy-mons in that series of games.
3364000	3373000	But I don't see these new ones very often at all. I think I've caught like an Aron, I've caught the thing that looks like a flower with tentacles or something weird.
3373000	3383000	But I've hatched a lot because Pokemon also is doing that event right now where all the eggs are hatching Gen 3 Pokemon. I don't remember how long that's going, I think it was about a week.
3384000	3393000	But all the eggs you collect now are going to hatch Gen 3 Pokemon. Keep in mind, if you have eggs in your inventory that you've been sitting on for a while, they can still hatch anything.
3393000	3399000	They might hatch Gen 3, but they're probably going to hatch Gen 1 or Gen 2 because what is in the egg is determined when you get the egg.
3399000	3402000	So any egg you collect now is going to have Gen 3 Pokemon in it.
3402000	3404000	Yeah, I need to hatch my eggs.
3405000	3414000	It's really good because I've been waiting to get a Wonder Treecko so I can evolve that because I have like 70 Treecko candies so I was ready to evolve it to the next step.
3414000	3422000	But I was waiting to get a Wonder, for those who don't know what that is, it's basically like a high appraised one that has good attack, defense, HP.
3422000	3428000	So I was waiting until I got a Wonder Treecko to evolve it on down the line. It took me forever to get a Torchic that way too.
3428000	3436000	But when you hatch Pokemon, I think they're guaranteed to at least be like, what is it, 70% IV? 80% IV? I think?
3436000	3444000	So it's always going to be one of the top two appraisals. You're not going to get like, oh, this Pokemon is very unfortunate. So you're not going to get that.
3444000	3446000	Oh, this Pokemon, you should just put it down.
3446000	3448000	Yeah, take this Pokemon out.
3448000	3451000	It's not even worth the meat it's made up of.
3452000	3467000	Let's see, Act Def says, I do see Numels and Wishmer though. There was a Numel nest for a day here in SAC because the nest rotated the day they launched Gen 3, these new ones, and then they rotated again the very next day during their regular rotation.
3467000	3477000	So Capitol Park downtown was a Numel nest for a day. Meowth. Womp, womp. Yeah, right? Been there, done that.
3477000	3488000	I mean, that was a Wailmer nest just a couple weeks ago. That was the motherlode because I actually got a Wailmer nest and I got a Wailord just because that was a nest and that's where we went on community day.
3488000	3496000	So it was like Pikachu, Wailmer, Pikachu, Wailmer. Pikachu, Wailmer was, you know, awesome. But yeah, now it's Meowth. So we're hoping it'll turn into something better in a couple weeks.
3497000	3508000	But also pointing out Wishmer is pretty common. Yeah, I would say Wishmer is the one I've been seeing the most. But Wishmer is also one of the rare Pokemon that only takes 12 candy to evolve.
3508000	3515000	So that's good that that's plentiful because it's something new for the evolving game than just Pidgey. So that's good.
3515000	3520000	Can we just get rid of the Pidgeys? That would be nice.
3521000	3526000	I like catching Pidgeys because I go, yay, this is more XP from evolving.
3526000	3534000	Okay. And then, of course, has been the main complaint with Pokemon Go. Lots of hacking.
3534000	3540000	So I guess these new Pokemon Go EX raids have been a prime target of hacking.
3540000	3548000	So I guess EX raids because I haven't actually done these yet. So they're an invitation only game event.
3548000	3557000	Neither have I. With as much as I play Pokemon Go, I have yet to get invited to one of these raids because they only ever put out the passes for the stupid sponsored stops.
3557000	3564000	And we don't have a Sprint store in this neighborhood or a Starbucks that is a sponsored stop. Excuse me, a gym. Sorry.
3564000	3568000	They're sponsored stops. We don't have gyms. Like none of the Starbucks here are gyms.
3568000	3575000	The closest Starbucks gym. And I'm not giving away where I live because this is far away.
3575000	3579000	How about Arden is the closest Starbucks gym? That's a ways away from here.
3579000	3583000	Oh, I've got one right by my house. The Safeway by my house.
3583000	3585000	You're going to give away where you live.
3585000	3588000	Oh, yes. By the Safeway. Which Safeway?
3588000	3590000	Alright, alright. You do what you want.
3590000	3598000	So there's a Safeway by my house that's a Starbucks gym. And then in that same shopping center they actually have a Sprint store that's also another sponsor.
3598000	3602000	I don't know if it's a gym. I think it might be a gym. I don't remember.
3602000	3609000	I actually know exactly where that is. But anyway, I do want to quickly say before because people are already starting to correct me in chat.
3609000	3617000	I do understand that parks are supposed to be rewarding this as well. Okay, I have a park right by my house I raid infrequently.
3617000	3620000	There's another park down the street I go to all the time I raid at frequently.
3620000	3628000	There's plenty of parks I've been raiding at and all the EX passes still seem to be going to Starbucks and Sprint.
3628000	3638000	I have yet, I mean, I think some of the parks in like East Sacramento, downtown, kind of like 30, I think McKinley Park I heard got a raid.
3638000	3643000	But it's rare. It's not, they need to rotate where that shit is happening better.
3643000	3649000	Like I get why they have sponsored stops, but just, you know, enough. Jesus.
3649000	3655000	So basically what happened was is there was an account of one person that did receive one of these invitations.
3655000	3665000	It's basically a 20 man raid at a certain location. And so the person gets there to go, you know, catch I guess Mewtwo or something like that.
3665000	3672000	And the app said that there was 40 people standing right next to them when there was no one standing next to them.
3672000	3676000	It's just, you know, people spoofing their location.
3676000	3680000	And that's why they need to mix it up because they need to throw these spoofers off their game.
3680000	3689000	Because spoofers are regularly raiding those stupid Sprint and Starbucks gyms so that they can get these EX passes so that the rest of us can't get them.
3689000	3699000	So that's the number one thing that Niantic needs to change and they can do it now is cycle out where you're giving out the EX passes.
3699000	3711000	Like, okay, cool. Yes. Again, I understand those sponsored places give you money, but consider like shaking it up a little more and throw these spoofers off their game because they have you figured out.
3711000	3717000	Yeah. And basically, you know, the lobbies in those matches are completely full of spoofers.
3717000	3724000	So and, you know, they're saying that, of course, another thing that you see is a lot of gyms constantly filled with fake accounts.
3725000	3732000	It's only, you know, honestly, in my opinion, it's only going to get worse when you can actually trade Pokémon. Can you imagine that? Because now you can have just accounts that are disposable.
3732000	3736000	I think that's why they've been dragging their fucking feet on that rollout.
3736000	3737000	Yeah.
3737000	3748000	ActDeftInChat says at live.vognetwork.com, you kind of have to manipulate gyms and stuff. We don't have sponsored gyms in Mexico at all, and people manage to get those EX rates.
3748000	3758000	Well, I would imagine because you don't have the sponsored stuff, your parks are becoming those locations. Am I wrong? Like, they're coming up with some type of alternate location.
3758000	3764000	And if I'm right in that, that's actually probably better than what we have, at least where I live.
3764000	3773000	You know, okay, yes, there are Sprint and Starbucks stuff, but it's on the other side of town. And I'm lazy. And rush hour.
3773000	3780000	And the rates end by like 7.30, 8 o'clock. So if I don't go there during rush hour, I'm screwed.
3781000	3791000	Anyway. Let's see. FantasmChat says, I love New York City. When I was there at any Starbucks nearby, they were so busy, the Wi-Fi was so slow.
3791000	3798000	So, I mean, was it all Pokémon players trying to get on the local gym? I don't know. Alright. Anyway.
3798000	3804000	Let's talk about a game that a lot of people are looking forward to, and that is the Avengers project that's coming.
3804000	3806000	Oh yeah, I forgot all about that.
3806000	3808000	Yeah, right? Remember they announced it at E3.
3808000	3811000	I was excited. I'm still excited, but I need to see what it is.
3811000	3820000	Well, this might make you more excited, actually. You may or may not have heard that Sean S. Gagge, I hope I said that right,
3820000	3827000	he was with Naughty Dog and worked on Uncharted and The Last of Us. He joined this team at the beginning of the year.
3827000	3832000	And then just this past week, Stephen Berry from EA Visceral, who worked on Dead Space,
3832000	3839000	and some other staff who've collectively worked on Batman Arkham Origins and Star Wars Battlefront.
3839000	3843000	And Crystal Dynamics in a statement about, you know, boasting all this new talent says,
3843000	3851000	their AAA experience adds to an already deep roster, making us well positioned to deliver on the ambitious goals we've set for ourselves with the Avengers project.
3851000	3859000	It's a stellar addition of many people who fit incredibly well into our wheelhouse of building game experiences we all love.
3859000	3866000	This Marvel game is shaping up to be something pretty big, and I imagine this is going to be talk of the town at E3 this year.
3866000	3869000	This is probably going to be one of the biggest titles at E3 this year.
3869000	3873000	I hope so. I'm a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
3873000	3875000	There is a new Avengers movie this year, right?
3875000	3876000	There is one in May.
3876000	3877000	So, there you go.
3877000	3884000	The big infinity wars where it's like fucking everything. Just throw the sink kitchen in there.
3885000	3891000	So, maybe the game won't be out by May, because I would think that they would have had to start the ball rolling on that by now.
3891000	3893000	Well, they still have stuff after this movie.
3893000	3898000	Oh, sure. Well, yeah. There's a second part to Infinity War. I'm well aware of that.
3898000	3905000	And there's always timingness with the Blu-ray release, so, you know, it doesn't have to come out date and day with the movie.
3905000	3913000	So, yeah. It's shaping up to be big. I'm excited to see E3. I think that's going to be the big, big game this year. We'll see.
3913000	3920000	And, um, isn't there... Didn't we hear rumblings of a third Tomb Raider game? There were rumors and stuff.
3920000	3924000	Or did they pass it off to another studio? Or what was the deal with that?
3924000	3929000	Maybe. I mean, I know there's a Tomb Raider movie that's coming out. Isn't that this year? That should be this year.
3929000	3930000	I think that's this year too, yeah.
3930000	3933000	Maybe we'll see an announcement around E3?
3933000	3934000	Meh.
3935000	3938000	That'll be another big thing to reveal at E3. We'll see.
3938000	3944000	Alright, just another story here before we get to the classic game of the week, which sadly, Jamie's not here to do it this week.
3944000	3947000	But I stole it in her place, as I tend to do. Loki.
3947000	3953000	Alright. So, let's talk a little bit about Xbox Game Pass, in case you forgot what that was.
3953000	3961000	It's a service that you can pay money to each month, and you basically get access to over a hundred different games.
3962000	3968000	Kind of think of it a little bit like that PlayStation Now, where you can stream stuff, except this also has Xbox.
3968000	3972000	I mean, I guess PlayStation Now also has, like, PlayStation 4 games as well.
3972000	3975000	I don't know. I don't subscribe to it because I think it's a terrible service, but...
3975000	3977000	Now, the Xbox will do it.
3977000	3979000	Well, but they want you to subscribe to it.
3979000	3984000	Well, you know what? I might be more open to subscribing to it if they fucking added backwards compatibility.
3985000	3991000	Whereas Microsoft is actually doing that quite often, and adding new games every month.
3991000	3995000	So, you know what? I would give them more of the benefit of the streaming service than I would...
3995000	4000000	To be fair, isn't a big, big chunk of the collection PlayStation 3 games, though?
4000000	4003000	I mean, that's backwards compatible. You want it to go all the way back to PS2 and PS4?
4003000	4010000	I want it to be able to pop a disc into my system and just play it if I want to, is what I want.
4010000	4012000	Is that so much to ask?
4012000	4018000	Apparently. Well, let's come back to this topic later in the show. Yes and no.
4018000	4025000	So anyways, so now they're saying that with this service, before it was, you know, pretty much Xbox 360 games and stuff like that.
4025000	4034000	Now they're saying that they're going to even add new exclusive Xbox games that are going to be coming out day and date with their releases.
4034000	4046000	So for example, Crackdown 3, they show Sea of Thieves and State of Decay 2 as some titles that will be available on the service the same time that they're released.
4046000	4052000	So that's pretty awesome. So basically, I guess it looks like, yeah, six month subscription to the service is about 60 bucks.
4052000	4057000	Ten bucks a month isn't bad, especially if you're into renting games and stuff.
4058000	4068000	So yeah, that's pretty awesome. I mean, if I had an Xbox One and I was into just playing kind of a little bit of everything, that might not be a bad option.
4068000	4073000	But I'm just going to get Crackdown 3 when it comes out on PC.
4073000	4082000	Microsoft's really trying to push to, especially, I mean, Sony's vulnerable right now with their PlayStation Network kind of flopping a lot this past week too.
4082000	4085000	Microsoft's going to try to seize the moment. They have to.
4085000	4093000	If I had to go back and pick, I got a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, I probably might have gone with Xbox One.
4093000	4100000	I like PlayStation VR, so that's a thing. But honestly, they've had better mod support in their games.
4100000	4107000	They've had, as far as the games coming out multi-platform and stuff, it seems like that they have more features or play better on the Xbox One.
4108000	4113000	I have to give Microsoft kudos. I love the way they've handled backwards compatibility. I really do.
4113000	4121000	It's not perfect because the game rollout has been slower, but it's really, really better than what's going on at Sony right now.
4121000	4131000	Well, just like getting into it later, but if it's that easy, clearly you're trying to monetize it. You're trying to make money off of it.
4131000	4134000	So it's like, come on. This is ridiculous.
4134000	4143000	Kaijuto in chat says, PSN isn't flopping. You live in some kind of Trump Earth too. Okay, hold on, because I am not fucking standing for that comparison, first of all.
4143000	4151000	So I am live going right now to Google News, which hopefully is truthy enough for you.
4151000	4160000	And I'm going to Google PlayStation Network. Oh, here we go. Top result, nine hours ago. PlayStation Network is having issues again.
4160000	4163000	It has been down recently quite a bit from what I hear.
4163000	4172000	So let's see. What else do we have here? Some other headlines here. PlayStation Network hit with server issues for several days.
4172000	4180000	PlayStation Network update for PlayStation 4 users playing Fortnite and Overwatch. PSN status down. So on and so on.
4180000	4183000	So you can miss me with that comment. Thank you very much.
4184000	4193000	All right. Anyhow, let's go back. Let's go back to when times were a little simpler. We didn't even have to worry about online stuff.
4193000	4198000	We didn't have to worry about online games. You know why? Because you had to go to an arcade to play them.
4198000	4201000	And those arcade games weren't online either.
4201000	4204000	That's right. They were never down.
4204000	4207000	Well, let's not go that far.
4208000	4210000	That's true. Sometimes they were there.
4210000	4217000	It's the classic game of the week where we're going to step into the gaming vault and pick out a game that we think, hey, this deserves a little bit of your respect this week.
4217000	4226000	And for what it's worth, this is something you can play on Sony PlayStation and download it from the store. It's in the Arcade Archives.
4226000	4232000	And you can check out a classic game called Bomb Jack. That's what I picked for the classic game this week.
4237000	4240000	A little bit of the noise there for the arcade version of Bomb Jack.
4240000	4243000	Bomb Jack was released in 1984.
4243000	4248000	It was released by a company called Tekan, not to be confused with Tekan.
4248000	4252000	But they actually changed the name of this company a little later on to be Tecmo.
4252000	4254000	So you probably heard of Tecmo.
4254000	4261000	And this ended up in one of the Tecmo collections, I think, that showed up on Xbox and stuff later on.
4261000	4263000	So anyway, what is Bomb Jack?
4264000	4269000	In this game, you're kind of like, I would say like a floaty Pac-Man is the best way to describe Bomb Jack.
4269000	4271000	It's like Pac-Man with gravity.
4271000	4273000	But it's like you kind of float.
4273000	4277000	You're like the princess from Super Mario Brothers 2.
4277000	4282000	No, more like Luigi in the way that he slowly kind of jumps and can kind of hang at the top.
4282000	4284000	That's what Bomb Jack does.
4284000	4286000	He does high jumps. He floats in the air.
4286000	4288000	And what you've got to do in this game, you collect the red bombs on the screen.
4288000	4291000	And you've got to avoid the birds and the mummies.
4291000	4294000	I don't know why birds and mummies are the enemies, but there you go.
4294000	4297000	And they can morph into things like flying saucers.
4297000	4299000	And if you touch them, you die.
4299000	4305000	But, if you get a power coin, as the player there did, because you heard the little wah-wah noise,
4305000	4307000	you can actually destroy these things.
4307000	4309000	It's very similar to when you eat a power...
4309000	4310000	The Pac-Man.
4310000	4313000	So what's up with the pyramids and stuff in the background there?
4313000	4316000	That's just the aesthetic of the background, yeah.
4316000	4323000	If you collect the bombs in a certain order, you will fill up the meter faster and get that P a little faster.
4323000	4329000	You can also get a bonus coin, an extra life coin, and a special coin, which gives you a free game.
4329000	4331000	So as you can imagine, that one is not very common.
4331000	4335000	It was ported everywhere to a variety of different systems.
4335000	4341000	And that's actually where I know this game from, because of course, my childhood, Commodore 64.
4341000	4343000	There was a version of this on the Commodore 64.
4344000	4346000	Now here's the thing I want to talk about with Commodore 64 for a minute.
4346000	4349000	So you hear the music in this game, right?
4349000	4352000	It's all like cutesy, right?
4352000	4354000	And see, this level doesn't have the ancient Egypt.
4354000	4357000	It's got like an old castle-type aesthetic.
4357000	4358000	So they kind of change.
4358000	4360000	Well, here's the thing.
4360000	4365000	The music on the Commodore 64 was completely different, and it was awesome.
4365000	4368000	Here's the music from the Commodore 64 version of the game.
4373000	4377000	You got it.
4377000	4381000	Oh man, that sweet sounds of the Commodore 64.
4381000	4382000	It's just amazing.
4382000	4384000	So yeah, I like that song a lot better.
4384000	4394000	Which, by the way, this song was an actual song from the 80s that somebody made, I guess, to be in Bomb Jack.
4394000	4397000	It was kind of like a licensed song for the Commodore 64.
4397000	4402000	But the song is a little bit obscure, unless you really follow electronic music.
4402000	4405000	I know this guy is really big in his industry.
4405000	4407000	His name, and I hope I'm pronouncing it correctly.
4407000	4411000	His name is Jean-Michel Jarre, I think is how you pronounce his name.
4411000	4416000	It was a song called Magnetic Fields Part 2, and here's that song.
4423000	4426000	Right? It's the same song.
4426000	4430000	But this song is from 1984, and it fucking sounds like it, right?
4432000	4435000	There's no lyrics or anything. It's that kind of song.
4438000	4441000	Anyway, I don't want to play too much of that song because I don't want to get sued.
4441000	4448000	So we'll go back to the sweet Commodore 64 version of that song while I talk about some of the other ports of the game.
4448000	4453000	For example, in 1985 it was on the Sega SG-1000.
4453000	4457000	86 saw a release on the Spectrum, the ZX Spectrum.
4457000	4459000	It was also on Amstrad.
4459000	4463000	It was on the Atari ST, the Amiga, the Game Boy in 1992.
4463000	4465000	And then it kind of started showing up in retro collections.
4465000	4468000	It was on the MSX. That was an unofficial homebrew.
4468000	4471000	PlayStation 2 had Tecmo Hit Paradise.
4471000	4473000	Xbox had Tecmo Classic Arcade.
4473000	4475000	It was on the Wii Virtual Console.
4475000	4482000	In 2007 the NES version of the game was, and the arcade version came out when the Wii Virtual Console started doing arcades.
4482000	4485000	It's on the 3DS Virtual Console, the NES version anyway.
4485000	4489000	And all the way up to 2014 when the PlayStation 4 port came out.
4489000	4491000	And then Wii U Virtual Console as well.
4491000	4497000	Lastly, in 2017 finally the iPhone got a version of this as well.
4497000	4502000	So yeah, it's a classic game that's come back a lot in some of these retro collections.
4502000	4507000	Some people may know this from Mighty Bomb Jack.
4507000	4512000	That was an NES game and an arcade game that came out in 86.
4512000	4518000	I do want to stress that game was similar in how the bomb guy kind of flew around and collected bombs.
4518000	4522000	Or people thought they were cherries, the NES version, because they kind of didn't look like bombs.
4522000	4526000	But it was more of a side-scroller in Mighty Bomb Jack.
4526000	4528000	It wasn't that way in the original Bomb Jack.
4528000	4530000	The original Bomb Jack had the static screens.
4530000	4533000	And the reason why I picked Bomb Jack over Mighty Bomb Jack is that
4533000	4535000	A. I kind of think it was a better game.
4535000	4541000	B. The sweet, sweet music from my Commodore 64.
4542000	4544000	There you go.
4544000	4546000	Bomb Jack, your classic game of the week.
4546000	4549000	Did you ever play that, Loki, on any of those millions of...
4549000	4551000	I don't remember that, no.
4551000	4554000	Fantaz in chat says, this song sounds ahead of its time.
4554000	4557000	Dude, seriously, Commodore 64 stuff, like a lot of it was.
4557000	4561000	Just go to YouTube and just Google, like, best Commodore 64 soundtrack
4561000	4565000	And you'll get a whole bunch of Commodore 64 game stuff that was just amazing.
4565000	4568000	In fact, ooh, I should play something during the break tonight.
4568000	4571000	Let's see, also, Tiger Claw in chat says,
4571000	4576000	It's interesting how much video game music has influenced electronic dance music these days.
4576000	4579000	That is an interesting observation, now it's come full circle.
4579000	4583000	You know, the electronic dance music probably influenced the early video game music.
4583000	4585000	And still does, I'm sure.
4585000	4587000	But now it's going the other way as well, you're absolutely right.
4587000	4591000	It's that video game music, like you hear video games sometimes get sampled
4591000	4594000	In, you know, pop and electronic stuff, which is pretty cool.
4594000	4597000	Yeah, Fantaz in chat says,
4597000	4600000	I was watching a DJ called Zed, he's a pretty well-known guy,
4600000	4603000	Drop Zelda, and everyone was cheering.
4603000	4606000	Some guy, I don't remember the guy's name,
4606000	4609000	Maybe one of you guys that follows electronic music better than I do knows,
4609000	4612000	Some guy played Look to the Sky from DDR during his set.
4612000	4614000	I remember that came up on the show about a year ago or so,
4614000	4618000	And everybody was, woo, because, you know, like a DDR song is pretty cool.
4618000	4620000	So, anyway.
4620000	4623000	That's going to do it for this segment of Orange Lawns Radio,
4623000	4626000	But we'll be back after a quick break, we've got plenty more Orange Lawns Radio to come,
4626000	4629000	Including a store where you buy video games from,
4629000	4632000	Might not be there in a couple months, we'll talk a little bit about that.
4632000	4635000	And we'll talk about an interesting new patent from Sony,
4635000	4639000	And more when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lawns Radio.
4645000	4649000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lawns Radio Live Tonight,
4649000	4656000	This is episode number 716 of our show in progress here for January the 28th of 2018.
4656000	4659000	You missed some DDR talk at the top of the show if you're just joining us live.
4659000	4662000	Loki got a DDR machine, if you can believe it.
4662000	4666000	And I went to a fun tournament yesterday, which we had talked about last week on the show,
4666000	4669000	That felt like going to a high school reunion, but like the one I wanted to go to.
4669000	4671000	So, anyway.
4671000	4674000	We're going to get back into some more news that we have yet to cover,
4674000	4677000	And we'll start off with some rapid fire news. Loki.
4677000	4682000	Yes, so unfortunately, and this is kind of not the whole shocking being that they've,
4682000	4685000	You know, had talked about bankruptcy not too long ago,
4685000	4690000	But court documents have been filed regarding Toys R Us,
4690000	4695000	And as part of their chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization plan,
4695000	4702000	They're going to be closing 182 Toys R Us locations across 40 states.
4702000	4705000	Now however, this is Toys R Us and Babies R Us as well,
4705000	4709000	So they are including the Babies R Us locations as well,
4709000	4713000	And thankfully, at least in this neck of the woods,
4713000	4716000	It's only a Babies R Us, so whatevs.
4716000	4718000	Your babies are grown up, you don't care.
4718000	4720000	Yeah, we went there before, but whatever.
4720000	4723000	Like most of the Toys R Us nowadays, they have like a section that is Babies R Us.
4723000	4728000	Yeah, Toys R Us, like every Toys R Us I've been to, like the whole back corner is like the baby section.
4728000	4734000	So it's, I mean, it's disappointing to see all this stuff closing, but...
4734000	4736000	Now somebody asked me on Twitter, just so you know,
4736000	4738000	Because we've talked about it on the show,
4738000	4742000	When Shane was here, we talked about our adventure to the Toys R Us that's two hours away,
4742000	4746000	That still has the paper slips to get video games, remember that?
4746000	4749000	And somebody asked me on Twitter, is that on the list? Did that one close?
4749000	4752000	No, it is still going to be open,
4752000	4757000	And hopefully still going to make it take paper slips up to the front to get the games that you need.
4757000	4760000	Yeah, like, ironically, I go to Toys R Us quite often,
4760000	4764000	Because it's just, it's nearby and the kids like looking at stuff,
4764000	4769000	So it's still very, you know, it's always busy when I go in there.
4769000	4771000	It's never like, you know, not busy.
4771000	4776000	I mean, I'm sure that they've been impacted a bit by, you know, other retailers and stuff,
4776000	4781000	But, you know, honestly, think about it, like how many big toy stores are there?
4781000	4785000	I mean, there's department stores, so you have like toy stores and stuff in like, you know,
4785000	4789000	Targets and Walmarts and stuff like that, but there's not really any big toy stores anymore.
4789000	4791000	They're the only ones.
4791000	4798000	But I do think the Target and the Walmart toy sections are what's doing them in more than like Amazon.
4798000	4801000	I really do. I think it's those.
4801000	4804000	And to some extent, I mean, I know this is very minor,
4804000	4808000	But there's a lot of toys and board games and stuff you can get at like Walgreens,
4808000	4811000	And drugstores almost always have a toy aisle, right?
4811000	4814000	I guess those are like kind of discounted close out stuff.
4814000	4818000	I guess that's true. I think it's probably more the Targets and the Walmarts than anything.
4818000	4822000	And it's also people buying smarter because nowadays, like if you're looking for something,
4822000	4824000	You know, like I do a lot of Lego stuff.
4824000	4829000	I look at there's like whole subreddits and stuff to like deals that are going on.
4829000	4831000	So it's easy to find.
4831000	4833000	Okay, I want to get this set.
4833000	4836000	Who has it on sale, you know, right now?
4836000	4838000	Oh, Walmart has it on sale, so I'm gonna go get it over there.
4838000	4840000	Or there's ways to check inventory and stuff.
4840000	4847000	But Toys R Us, you know, they do have a lot of stuff that you might not necessarily find at those locations.
4847000	4851000	Like, you know, they have a larger variety of toys that are available.
4851000	4855000	Whereas those, you know, Targets and Walmarts don't carry everything.
4855000	4858000	In chat at live.vognetwork.com, Rockat says,
4858000	4860000	I love going to Toys R Us all the time.
4860000	4866000	Yeah, you know, the whole way that two hour away from here Toys R Us story came up is because,
4866000	4870000	You know, Shane, as one of the hosts of Ranger Pride, which I know has been on hiatus for a little bit,
4870000	4872000	But hopefully it's coming back soon.
4872000	4874000	He loves to collect the Power Ranger toys.
4874000	4876000	And so you'd have to go to like all the Toys R Us areas.
4876000	4878000	So sometimes I would join him because I'd be like,
4878000	4882000	Oh, well, I could play Ingress or Pokemon and, you know, go to some new places.
4882000	4886000	Or, heck, in the case of driving all the way up to Chico to go to Toys R Us,
4886000	4889000	I'm gonna go to Hula's Mongolian Barbecue, which is like the most amazing Mongolian Barbecue,
4889000	4890000	But it's all the way up there.
4890000	4892000	So I find a reason to tag along, right?
4892000	4894000	So, you know, that would be-
4894000	4896000	Oh man, I haven't had Mongolian Barbecue in a long time.
4896000	4898000	That sounds really good.
4898000	4904000	Yeah, so, uh, yeah, so it was kind of like, the toys are, the toy part's cool, but I'm tagging along for the food.
4905000	4907000	And the uniques.
4907000	4911000	God, I remember like, it's like, I remember being a kid and just like,
4911000	4912000	Oh yeah, we're gonna go to Toys R Us.
4912000	4914000	And it's like, such the event.
4914000	4915000	Oh yeah.
4915000	4916000	Oh shit, you know, like-
4916000	4918000	Well, and Rock Hat again in chat is referencing,
4918000	4921000	I remember seeing the world of Nintendo back in my early years.
4921000	4923000	Well, they used to do all that, remember like,
4923000	4926000	Wasn't it like Nickelodeon did a sweepstakes back in the day?
4926000	4928000	Where it was like, you would have like,
4928000	4929000	What was it like the-
4929000	4930000	What do they call that shit?
4930000	4932000	Like the shop to you drop?
4932000	4937000	I don't know, but it was something like, you had like two minutes in a Toys R Us, or maybe it was KB.
4937000	4938000	No, it was Toys R Us.
4938000	4939000	Was it Toys R Us?
4939000	4940000	Yeah, Toys R Us.
4940000	4941000	And it was like, just fill that card.
4941000	4943000	It was like you were on Supermarket Sweep, but a toy store.
4943000	4944000	Yeah, they-
4944000	4946000	And it was like the contest everybody wanted to win.
4946000	4950000	Yeah, they were, and there is funny that you mention that, because also Reddit,
4950000	4957000	There was an AMA that happened a while back, where they had an AMA for someone that was a winner of that contest,
4957000	4960000	And like, about what happened, and how that went down.
4960000	4964000	God bless Reddit getting the stuff that people really want to know.
4964000	4968000	It's awesome, but like, they talked about it like, I guess like beforehand, like obviously they filmed everything,
4968000	4974000	But beforehand, like, they would walk them around the store, like to show them where stuff was,
4974000	4980000	Like, and they wouldn't have to necessarily get big things, like they could just kind of tag that they wanted to get that,
4980000	4982000	Because obviously they're not going to be able to load stuff in their cart.
4982000	4984000	But like, yeah, it was great.
4984000	4987000	They can't throw hams in the shopping cart, like they do on Supermarket Sweep.
4987000	4991000	Which, by the way, is still like in the top three of like all-time best games.
4991000	4993000	That's like one of my guilty pleasure shows.
4993000	4995000	That's one of the, which is, okay, okay.
4995000	4999000	I know this is rapid fire news, but the show is running shorter tonight, so guess what?
4999000	5003000	Coming up to the straight station, choo choo, tangent train, choo choo.
5003000	5004000	Okay, here we go.
5004000	5007000	One of my favorite things to watch on Twitch lately.
5007000	5010000	I am obsessed.com, I don't think I've talked about this on the show.
5010000	5014000	I am obsessed.com with Buzzer on Twitch.
5014000	5015000	What? What's that?
5015000	5017000	It's B-U-Z-Z-R.
5017000	5022000	And all they do, all day long, on Twitch, apparently they are also a digital channel.
5022000	5026000	Because you know how like when all the TV stations went from like analog to digital?
5026000	5030000	Like, all these new networks showed up.
5030000	5032000	But it's bullshit nobody watches.
5032000	5041000	Like, except maybe like, okay, maybe you have like a grandma that watches the digital network that shows reruns from the 50s and 60s of obscure TV shows.
5041000	5044000	Like all the time. Because this is stuff grandma remembers, right?
5044000	5045000	Those types of things.
5045000	5049000	Well, one of these digital expansions is a network called Buzzer that shows old game shows.
5049000	5052000	It's owned by Fermantle Media who did a lot of those old game shows.
5052000	5057000	So, they have a selection, it's most of those that they actually play on Twitch.
5057000	5065000	Now, the only read I'm going to give Twitch is that it's very obvious they run the same five hour block over and over for a few days and then switch it out.
5065000	5070000	But it is still very nice to be able to come home from work, plop on the couch, fire up the Xbox 360,
5070000	5075000	and watch on Buzzer old episodes of the match game with Brett Summers and Charles Nelson Reilly.
5075000	5083000	Although lately all the episodes they've been showing have had the guy that was Radar and Mash instead of Charles Nelson Reilly because he was, you know, he was filming a movie or something.
5083000	5084000	So, he was gone for a little while.
5084000	5088000	But anyway, my point is, I fucking love watching old game shows right now.
5088000	5092000	And my understanding is Buzzer over the air just got Supermarket Sweep.
5092000	5095000	And that's like got to be my top three like of all time game shows.
5095000	5103000	It's just, it was one of those shows like, you know, where you would be homesick from school or something.
5103000	5109000	I think it was more of like from school and it's like the shit that you would watch on TV that you would never normally see because-
5109000	5110000	Today is Price is Right day.
5110000	5115000	It's like Price is Right, it's just like all this like, you know, what was it?
5115000	5121000	The People's Court, you know, Supermarket Sweep, all the game shows.
5121000	5126000	You know, someday when I'm inevitably gone and away from this earth, I want people to remember this.
5126000	5132000	One of the best highlights of my life, my entire fucking life, was the day I got to go see The Price is Right done live.
5132000	5138000	No, sadly they didn't call me down on stage. I guess I just wasn't, you know, I was nervous or something.
5138000	5142000	But we did get to see, we saw two episodes of The Price is Right because it was a Monday.
5142000	5146000	And we saw one and they were like, we need to fill up our audience for the second one, who wants to stay?
5146000	5147000	We do!
5147000	5156000	But for the first episode, which was hosted by Bob Barker, I got to sit, which all in itself, I got to see Bob Barker host a game show.
5156000	5160000	I mean, check that off the bucket list, right?
5160000	5165000	But I also got to sit right behind Rod Roddy, rest in peace, right?
5165000	5168000	The infamous announcer of The Price is Right for many, many, many years.
5168000	5172000	I got to sit right behind him in that jacket, because you know he dressed like Liberace.
5172000	5175000	He never wore anything, he always wore a say something outfit.
5175000	5178000	And that jacket was sparkling in my face, it was legit.
5178000	5185000	So, I just want everybody to remember, like, what were like the greatest memories of Rob's life the day I got to go see The Price is Right.
5185000	5187000	Two episodes.
5187000	5193000	Anyway, I love an excuse to talk about old game shows here on Orange Launch Radio.
5193000	5195000	It's a secret, not so secret advice of mine.
5195000	5201000	Speaking of which, when the hell is, you know, when are we getting Starrcade back again?
5201000	5202000	Wasn't that supposed to be something?
5202000	5204000	That was supposed to be a thing.
5204000	5205000	What was that coming back?
5205000	5207000	I haven't heard. I haven't heard.
5207000	5213000	Come on, Noel Gus in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, buzzer, I hardly knew her.
5213000	5217000	That's B-U-Z-Z-R, there's no E in it. That's the way they do the network.
5217000	5227000	So this is a thing that I never thought I would have to read before, but apparently, someone got the idea that, hey, let's make a Duke Nukem movie.
5227000	5233000	Which, I'm for that, because Duke Nukem is trash, and it's going to be a trash movie, so I'm down with it.
5233000	5236000	So who do they decide that they're thinking about casting?
5236000	5241000	You know what, if they can do Battleship, let them fucking do Duke Nukem. I don't give a fuck anymore.
5241000	5249000	The Clue reboot, nothing's going to damage me anymore. Fuck up all the old video games, I don't give a shit.
5249000	5256000	Honestly, you can't fuck up the series any more than Duke Nukem Forever did, so they've already hit rock bottom.
5256000	5258000	It only goes up from here.
5258000	5259000	It only goes up from here.
5259000	5261000	Do you think she's going to jump?
5261000	5262000	Duke Nukem Forever releases.
5263000	5264000	I'm referencing a new movie.
5264000	5271000	So they have John Cena as Duke Nukem. I can't see it, but I don't care, because who gives a shit?
5271000	5275000	And who, who would be producing this?
5275000	5279000	But of course, Michael Bay's production company, Platinum Dudes.
5279000	5282000	So Michael Bay movie, starring John Cena with Duke Nukem.
5282000	5285000	I'm there, butt in seat, yes.
5285000	5290000	There's Extra, and then there's Straight Bro Guy Extra.
5290000	5300000	And this is Straight Bro Guy Extra, which in some ways is more extra than the premiere of RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars 3.
5300000	5306000	There's no plot. It's Guy shouting out one-liners, saving strippers and killing aliens.
5308000	5310000	Who cares? It's going to be fucking awesome.
5310000	5319000	I'm sorry, I'm just laughing at the whole concept of this. This is extra for straight men. This is exactly what it is.
5319000	5323000	John Cena in a Duke Nukem movie produced by Michael Bay.
5323000	5327000	Like, did somebody, somebody made this up? This has to be made up. This can't be real.
5327000	5331000	You can't get more American than that.
5332000	5342000	ActDeftInChat says, you do know John Cena is family-friendly, right? Well, so was Elizabeth Berkley when she was on Saved by the Bell.
5342000	5346000	Yeah, you know what, and that's cool that John Cena is family-friendly.
5346000	5357000	I'm willing, you know, as much as I hate him, I'm willing to even have Mark Wahlberg reprising.
5357000	5358000	No!
5358000	5360000	Or something like that.
5360000	5361000	Everything.
5361000	5367000	He was all right in pain and gain. I mean, so he can buff up, you know, to like Duke Nukem.
5367000	5371000	In the happening, he ran away from wind.
5371000	5381000	Okay, to be fair, yes, Mark Wahlberg is terrible. Mark Wahlberg didn't write, direct that movie. He was just, he was just a participant.
5381000	5387000	And the new M. Night Shyamalan is better than old M. Night Shyamalan nowadays, so I don't know.
5387000	5391000	I mean, granted, he has like, you know, he has the block out, blocked out face for that.
5391000	5398000	But yeah, I would be, it would be better if they could get someone that would do more of a...
5398000	5404000	Orel, what's his name? Was it John St. John? What's the guy's name? The guy that does actual Duke Nukem's voice?
5404000	5407000	Oh, yeah, I think it's like John St. John or something like that, yeah.
5407000	5409000	Yeah, and get him to do it.
5409000	5412000	Sadly, they never pick the actual voice actors.
5412000	5417000	It's like when they do a Mario movie inevitably, which, you know, seems like more and more is gonna happen, like an animated Mario movie.
5417000	5423000	They're not gonna get Charles Martinet to do the voice, which is unfortunate. He might get to do a cameo somewhere.
5423000	5428000	Like, he might play, like, Mario's dad or something, but he's not gonna be Mario's voice.
5428000	5432000	They're gonna get fucking Ryan Reynolds or something along those lines.
5432000	5434000	It's gonna be fucking weird, Danny DeVito.
5434000	5435000	I'm just saying.
5435000	5440000	If we can't get him to be Detective Pikachu, then we might as well get Danny DeVito to be Mario.
5440000	5442000	Mario or something, like, I don't care.
5442000	5448000	Oh, my God, Danny DeVito is Wario. Fanfic, sign me up. Make it happen.
5448000	5452000	You can play anybody. I don't care. Just cast him as somebody. Princess Peach, I don't care. That's fine.
5452000	5456000	It's just anybody. I'd just get him in.
5456000	5461000	No, I think Danny DeVito is Wario makes a lot of sense. It really does. Oh, my God.
5461000	5468000	Anyway, uh, hey, remember when we talked about, like, actual video game news on this program?
5468000	5472000	Let's talk about a new trailer for Soul Calibur VI that was released this week.
5472000	5479000	Speaking of a series that I hope is on the ups, coming up with this new game, Soul Calibur VI revealed some new characters.
5479000	5486000	Returning characters Nightmare, Shang-Wa, and Killik will be confirmed for Soul Calibur VI.
5486000	5491000	No big surprise there because all those characters were pretty well received in the early Soul Calibur games.
5491000	5496000	There's also a new person, Groh is the name, or Groh? G-R-O-H. How would you say that?
5496000	5499000	I'd say Groh, but that is Groh, maybe?
5499000	5501000	It sounds like Groh.
5501000	5508000	Yeah, maybe you have to say it with an edge or something like that. But anyway, Groh looks like he wears the power glove on his arm.
5508000	5514000	Groh is basically kind of like Doomfist with a sword and more armor. So, there you go.
5514000	5522000	Also of note, we have more talent news. This one's about Square Enix.
5522000	5529000	A pretty big name going over to Square Enix. Yuji Naka has joined Square Enix. He has mentioned that on his Twitter.
5529000	5536000	He said, just a quick note to let you know, I joined Square Enix in January. I'm joining game development as before and strive to develop games at Square Enix.
5536000	5539000	I aim to develop an enjoyable game. Please look forward to it.
5539000	5546000	And if the name Yuji Naka does not sound familiar, it should because he made Sonic the Hedgehog.
5546000	5555000	He was one of three people who made Sonic the Hedgehog. So, who knows? Maybe they're releasing a Final Fantasy spin-off where the bros drive a car and it's got to go fast.
5555000	5561000	No, I have no idea. Or hopefully just doing something new over Square Enix. That would be exciting too, a new IP.
5561000	5564000	So, he found the way to Square Enix?
5564000	5575000	He did. He sure did. By the way, it should be pointed out, Yuji Naka, he's known for Sonic, but he did work as a programmer on Alex Kidd in Miracle World and Fantasy Star.
5575000	5583000	He was a lead on Sonic the Hedgehog until his departure in 2006. So, maybe that's the reason.
5583000	5585000	So, Karen, what do you do when you're not...
5585000	5586000	Whoa, hello.
5586000	5587000	Talking.
5587000	5588000	Fucking autoplay.
5588000	5589000	Ghosts.
5589000	5597000	On the article I'm referencing. Rude. Alright, let's travel around the world and check out what's in stores this week. Loki.
5597000	5604000	Oh, there's a few things. So, actually this week we've got Dissida Final Fantasy NT coming to Playstation 4.
5604000	5606000	I didn't understand the demo at all.
5606000	5610000	Bad demo? Well, I guess Bobby's not picking on that.
5610000	5616000	I don't want to say it was like Ni No Kuni bad demo, but it was just like one of those, I didn't get it. I misunderstood the assignment.
5616000	5620000	I didn't get the first Dissida, so...
5620000	5623000	Bobby Black Wolf, did you play the Dissida demo?
5623000	5624000	I'll play it.
5624000	5632000	See, I don't think he did. Because if he did, I'd be hearing all about it on a show about how, what a terrible game it is. He wouldn't be talking about Ni No Kuni anymore.
5632000	5636000	Oh, he says he did play it. Wow.
5636000	5642000	He says it wasn't as bad as Ni No Kuni, but I couldn't get the gameplay. Alright, so he's in the same camp I am on that.
5642000	5647000	It's like they overcomplicated it. Just make Ergits again. Just, you know, with Final Fantasy characters.
5647000	5654000	I was just hoping it was just going to be like a beat-em-up fighter game. Like, which, another reason why I'm sad Jamie's not here tonight.
5654000	5659000	I know Dragon Ball, I bet she skipped this show to go play Dragon Ball Fighter fighters more. That's probably what it really is.
5659000	5663000	But, you know, why not just give me that with Final Fantasy characters? Like, seriously.
5663000	5665000	Yeah, well, I don't know.
5665000	5669000	There's a game called Sky Force Reloaded on the Nintendo Switch.
5669000	5675000	EA Sports UFC 3 on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.
5676000	5684000	Gundamoniums on Playstation 4 and Vita. Does that have anything to do with Gundam? It kind of sounds like it does.
5684000	5696000	It's a bullet hell shooter. I have no idea what it's supposed to be, but apparently you can upload your stuff to YouTube, so that's kind of cool.
5697000	5705000	And then, let's see. Finally, We Were Here Too for PC. That's it.
5705000	5707000	Alright, would you mind pulling up the UK stuff while I do it?
5707000	5708000	I already did.
5708000	5718000	Awesome, okay. I'm going to do Japan here real quick. Japan on the Playstation 4 on February 1st gets their release of Dragon Ball Fighters or FighterZ.
5718000	5726000	I'm not sure which one you're supposed to say what it is, but I like FighterZ better, but that's coming out in Japan on February 1st.
5726000	5728000	Just came out here a couple days ago.
5728000	5735000	And that game Gundamoniums is also out in Japan. They're talking about that in chat right now.
5735000	5740000	I think that is the same thing you were just referencing a moment ago. It has nothing to do with Gundam. It is like an indie shooter.
5740000	5744000	I actually was curious, because I like the name Gundamonium, so I actually kind of pulled it up to see more about it.
5744000	5749000	It kind of looks like a bullet hell type thing, but maybe like, it almost kind of looks like a newer cotton type of game.
5749000	5755000	Like, I'd be really curious if Jamie's into this, because the way, like with the girl flying with the gun, it kind of looks like cotton on the broom.
5755000	5761000	So I got to show this to Jamie. Man, miss a week, miss a lot. That's like the third time I'm like, Jamie really needed to see that tonight.
5761000	5763000	Hopefully she'll listen to this week's show.
5763000	5770000	Also in the next few days, EA Sports UFC 3 gets its Japanese release. That is worth pointing out as well.
5770000	5775000	Gundamonium is also making its way to the Vita this week, and that's the lone Vita release.
5775000	5783000	We do have in Japan on the Switch, Elder Scrolls V Skyrim gets its Japanese release on, excuse me, February 1st.
5783000	5788000	Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2, also its Japanese release on February 1st.
5788000	5795000	And that is it for the Nintendo Switch. Just quickly, lastly checking here to see if anything is on the 3DS this week.
5796000	5805000	No, we don't see anything for the 3DS in Japan really for quite a while. March 15th is the next big major release.
5805000	5807000	So I think the 3DS is really slowing down.
5807000	5809000	How about the UK, Loki?
5809000	5813000	Okay, UK, we've got a game called Candleman coming out on PC.
5813000	5820000	Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age, also on PC, and SteamWorld Dig on the Switch.
5820000	5828000	And then later on, we've got, looks like, actually it looks like that's it.
5828000	5833000	I thought there would be more. I'm sorely disappointed.
5833000	5837000	Alright, well usually the Europe, I think our Europe list only covers the big big stuff.
5837000	5840000	It kind of misses a lot of the indie stuff, so usually it's a little shorter over there.
5840000	5846000	Anyway, this is the part of the show where I would usually go to the mailbag, but unfortunately, it's empty.
5846000	5849000	Womp womp. No emails this week.
5849000	5854000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
5854000	5858000	But for now, I guess we will move on with some more news, won't we, Loki?
5858000	5860000	Yeah, so I'm kind of excited about this.
5860000	5866000	So apparently there's a new Sony patent that shows a possible upgrade to the PlayStation Move controller.
5866000	5873000	That they're going to be doing more of like a VR related kind of update to it.
5873000	5878000	So with that, they're saying that there's going to be some finger tracking technology as well.
5878000	5884000	Also, they were saying that there looks like something that's like the Move controller,
5884000	5889000	but they've got like an analog stick and some face buttons that look a little bit different.
5889000	5896000	I don't know. It kind of looks like a trigger similar to...
5896000	5900000	I don't know. It doesn't really look like a Vive controller or anything.
5900000	5904000	It's definitely different. So as long as it's better than the Move controller, I'm all down with that.
5904000	5911000	One thing I don't see though on this, based on the picture of those, I don't see the glowing ball on the end.
5911000	5918000	So how they're going to use the tracking with that, I don't see anything in this patent referencing the camera either.
5918000	5923000	So I'd be curious to see how it would work tracking the position of that.
5923000	5926000	So I got to buy a whole other set up of stuff for that.
5926000	5929000	Hey, as long as it works better, I don't fucking care.
5929000	5937000	That's really one of the worst things about the PlayStation VR is those Move controllers are fucking old and they don't work very well.
5937000	5941000	Yeah. I mean, I think everybody was really happy when it's like,
5941000	5945000	Oh, these old accessories I got for my PlayStation 3 are going to be beneficial now on VR.
5945000	5949000	And now the reality of the whole, oops, it's 10 years old technology at this point.
5949000	5957000	I'm wondering if they'll get rid of the camera and maybe do something similar to like the beacons that they have for like the Vive and stuff like that.
5957000	5964000	So it'll track it that way. I mean, I can't imagine, I don't know how it would work then based on this picture.
5964000	5967000	Do you think Sony's plotting another version of their VR headset?
5967000	5971000	Is it successful enough to plan a version two that would maybe bring some of this?
5971000	5977000	They might redesign it a little bit. I don't know if they're going to really, they can't really bump up the specs too much, I would think,
5977000	5979000	because it's really based on the system it's running on.
5979000	5986000	And I do need like a PlayStation 4 Pro if I'm going to, you know, really get into it, but we'll see.
5986000	5990000	I still need to pick up PlayStation VR. I've been kind of sleeping on that too long, but...
5990000	5993000	They have a lot of bundles nowadays. You can go in with Skyrim VR in it.
5993000	5996000	Nice. No, check that out. I hear Skyrim VR is pretty neat.
5996000	6000000	It's pretty cool. I just, you know, I just had picked up Skyrim again.
6000000	6004000	So like, I was like, eh, I never really want to spend another $60 on Skyrim.
6004000	6007000	I'll wait, I'll wait for it to get on sale and then I'll pick it up.
6007000	6013000	All right. Well, let's keep talking about PlayStation here and now finally address what we were kind of referencing a bunch in the first half of the show.
6013000	6019000	And that is, yep, hackers gonna hack, homebrew's gonna homebrew. Here's the deal.
6019000	6029000	So PlayStation 4 hackers and modders have managed to find how to get games running in the PlayStation 4 without legally owning them.
6029000	6036000	This is done with something called PS4 HEN and other modded software that lets the console read backed up games and so forth.
6036000	6041000	Sony's been releasing new PS4 firmware updates to plug these holes.
6041000	6049000	But the reason why I wouldn't usually bring that up because you should support games and buy games and I'm not here to tell you how to pirate them.
6049000	6052000	And I'm only mentioning that because Sony's plugging it up anyway.
6052000	6062000	Here's why I'm bringing it up is because a new tool from all this apparently allows you to play a backed up PlayStation 2 game on your PlayStation 4.
6063000	6069000	It's called PS2 PUBGEN and it's based on work that was done by another modder.
6069000	6074000	And it was using that same exploit that uses the PlayStation 4 games. That's why this all comes together.
6074000	6083000	And so via Twitter it was mentioned that they were able to get PlayStation 2 games running like Shinobi and Klonoa 2 on the PlayStation 4.
6083000	6088000	Klonoa 2 is of special note because that did not work on the PlayStation 3.
6088000	6093000	So the PlayStation 4's PS2 emulator seems to be better. Although that could just-
6093000	6094000	Although we'll never know because-
6094000	6095000	We'll never know.
6095000	6106000	So anyway, long story short, basically hackers have just shown that yes you can load. I mean they're backups and they're definitely a legal bad area.
6106000	6111000	But the reality is you can play PlayStation 2 games on PlayStation 4. This just proves it.
6111000	6119000	I mean we kinda already knew it because of the PlayStation 2 games that they sell on PlayStation 4 in the store.
6119000	6127000	But this shows that it can be run from a backup and essentially you can play, you know, other games that aren't necessarily for sale in the store.
6127000	6133000	So what gives Sony? Hackers beat you to it.
6133000	6137000	So now you can no longer say the system's not capable to do it. Well I don't know if Sony really did say that.
6137000	6140000	They've always just sidestepped the question.
6140000	6145000	Oh it's not something- It's a real minority of gamers who are asking for that. That's always the line that comes up.
6145000	6152000	It's hard to say that though when your competition's doing it quite a bit and they're offering that as some part of their service.
6152000	6155000	So, I don't know.
6155000	6160000	That being said though, like I have a lot of PlayStation 2 games that I've gotten like in Humble Bundle and stuff.
6160000	6162000	I don't play any of them.
6162000	6163000	PlayStation 2?
6163000	6164000	Yeah.
6164000	6165000	In Humble Bundle?
6165000	6167000	Are you sure you don't mean 3?
6167000	6168000	Maybe I mean 3.
6168000	6169000	I think you mean 3 because-
6169000	6171000	No, no, I do mean 2 actually.
6171000	6175000	How? Because Humble Bundle and PlayStation 2, there's no digital storefront there.
6175000	6176000	There's PSN.
6176000	6178000	Not on the 2.
6178000	6180000	PlayStation 2 is DVD.
6180000	6183000	For some games they have digital versions of them.
6183000	6185000	Where would you put it? There was no hard drive.
6185000	6187000	There's no hard drive on PS2.
6187000	6190000	PlayStation 2 games that are on the PlayStation 4.
6190000	6191000	Oh!
6191000	6195000	Not PlayStation 2 as in like the whole PlayStation 2.
6195000	6198000	Oh, the hamster woke up. He's running in the wheel now. I get it.
6198000	6202000	No, no, no. I got like, they did that for like the THQ games.
6202000	6208000	So like, Destroy All Humans, Red Faction, that kind of stuff.
6208000	6210000	So I've got a bunch from that.
6210000	6215000	I just don't necessarily, I don't play it too much.
6215000	6217000	Well, it's the same issue with Steam.
6217000	6220000	I own 500 games and I have nothing to play.
6220000	6221000	Yeah.
6221000	6222000	That's exactly-
6222000	6229000	Or I'm gonna go back to working on my DDR machine or playing Final Fantasy XIV or Pokemon Go or something.
6229000	6230000	Yeah.
6230000	6231000	I have nothing to play.
6234000	6236000	Alright, Loki, what's next for us?
6236000	6239000	Alright, so this is kind of interesting.
6239000	6248000	So Atari is asking people to invest in a roller tycoon game, roller coaster tycoon game for the Nintendo Switch.
6248000	6250000	So they're calling it Roller Coaster Tycoon Switch.
6250000	6257000	And this is apparently using a crowdfunding service called Start Engine.
6257000	6264000	And they're saying that they're looking to, you know, you have to invest a certain amount of money when you get a certain amount of profits back from it.
6264000	6266000	So it's actually revenue sharing.
6266000	6270000	The only problem with that is, you know, a few things.
6270000	6279000	One, they don't mention Roller Coaster Tycoon Worlds, which was a huge old flop that came out from them not too long ago.
6279000	6282000	They do only mention their first few games and that they have a mobile game.
6282000	6285000	And guess what this looks like a port of?
6285000	6287000	Yep, it's the mobile game.
6287000	6289000	So they're porting the mobile game to the Switch.
6289000	6296000	And apparently there's another comment saying that regardless of how well this does in the crowdfunding, they're still gonna bring it into the system.
6296000	6298000	So why should I pay you money?
6298000	6300000	I don't know.
6300000	6305000	It honestly doesn't look that interesting, especially after the last Roller Coaster Tycoon game that came out.
6305000	6309000	I don't really believe that they can make modern Roller Coaster Tycoon games.
6309000	6314000	And this is the same company that hopes to launch a new console real soon, huh?
6314000	6317000	Yeah, actually it is.
6317000	6319000	The Atari box or whatever they were calling it, right?
6319000	6321000	Whatever the fuck that's supposed to be.
6321000	6323000	Atari, y'all.
6323000	6327000	MXC in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says this crowdfunding news annoys me a lot.
6327000	6333000	The new Roller Coaster Tycoon is supposedly not a port, but it's by the same developers as the mobile game.
6333000	6335000	Well, I don't have a problem with that.
6335000	6339000	But based on their screenshots, whether they're showing as gameplay, it looked like the mobile version.
6339000	6342000	Yeah, well that's probably like their concept or whatever.
6342000	6344000	Yikes.
6344000	6347000	Alright, well let's move on to talking about, speaking of old games.
6347000	6349000	When I think Atari, I think of old games.
6349000	6351000	Back when they were like, you know, in their prime.
6351000	6361000	This is video game companies looking for an exemption to DMCA laws to preserve online video games.
6361000	6369000	So what happened here is that a notice of proposed rulemaking was published on October 26th.
6369000	6374000	Where the Copyright Office said they're going to be recommending that the existing exemptions be re-adopted.
6374000	6377000	And the Copyright Office began the public comment period.
6377000	6390000	So one of the proposals that was published said basically permitting circumvention by an eligible library, archives, or museum of TPMs protecting video games for which outside server support has been discontinued.
6390000	6409000	Specifically, the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment proposes expanding the existing exemption to further include multiplayer online games, video games with online multiplayer features, and massively multiplayer online games, whether stored physically or in downloadable formats, and to add preservationists affiliated with archival institutions as users.
6409000	6414000	So all this news we've been talking about earlier in the show, Miitomo, Paragon, right?
6414000	6417000	These games are things you're not going to be able to play at the end of the year.
6417000	6419000	Because they're going away.
6419000	6422000	So you will never be able to experience these games again.
6422000	6432000	Unless, A, hackers do something to allow you to kind of get back in as they've done with Star Wars Galaxy has some bootleg servers and stuff, right?
6432000	6434000	Or Final Fantasy XI.
6434000	6436000	Well technically Final Fantasy XI still exists.
6436000	6440000	Square's running it. Yeah, Square's running it still. On PC they are.
6440000	6442000	Really? I thought they shut that down a while ago.
6442000	6447000	No, because they did on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2, but it is still going on PC.
6447000	6448000	Really?
6449000	6451000	Check Steam. Still there.
6453000	6461000	But anyway, so the maid wanted to basically try to preserve these other games, which makes sense.
6461000	6471000	So they wanted an exemption for the DMCA laws so that way they would not get in trouble for running bootleg servers to allow people to experience these old games.
6472000	6484000	So maid has gone forth and talked about, you know, video games like Minecraft and Second Life will say as much about 21st century America as Dickens' Oliver's Twist does about 19th century Britain.
6484000	6487000	That is, if these games survive into the future.
6487000	6491000	So, you know, the possibility that Minecraft could go away somehow.
6491000	6502000	So they're asking the Register of Copyrights to recommend a modest expansion of the video game exemption adopted during the last rulemaking to allow for the preservation of abandoned video games that depend on external servers to function.
6502000	6505000	Online games or online video games.
6505000	6513000	I mean, it certainly makes sense to me, and as somebody who's a gaming fan, obviously I really want to see this happen.
6513000	6517000	I'll be really curious to see the response from the gaming companies.
6517000	6522000	Is there going to be a gaming company out there who kind of files to object to this?
6522000	6528000	And I just don't see who would want to do that and why, unless maybe they want to move their thing to mobile.
6528000	6532000	Because when you talk about Final Fantasy XI, it does make me think, oh, they were going to do that mobile thing.
6532000	6535000	Atari. I don't know. I'm just mad at Atari.
6535000	6537000	Just throw their name out there.
6537000	6539000	Well, they have done that in the past.
6540000	6549000	I want to say because they were reporting their games to mobile or something. I don't know. Fucking Atari. I don't know. Konami. Who knows.
6549000	6554000	So I'll be very curious to see if any game company kind of petitions to stop this, but I kind of don't see it happening.
6554000	6559000	It's really like, at that point, you made your money to the point where you shut down your servers.
6559000	6563000	So it's not like you're losing, I mean, as you guess, competition.
6563000	6567000	But honestly, how much is that really going to take away from yourself?
6567000	6571000	Although, I mean, like Blizzard did come down against the people that are running the classic WoW stuff.
6571000	6573000	But then again, WoW is running.
6573000	6574000	To turn around and do what?
6574000	6575000	To run the same thing.
6575000	6578000	Warcraft Classic or whatever they're calling it.
6578000	6581000	That'll be out probably by the end of the year, I imagine.
6581000	6586000	And it's going to suck. I'm telling everybody right now, Warcraft Classic's going to suck.
6586000	6589000	Everybody's going to play it for a month and be like, God, this is a grind.
6589000	6594000	But there's going to be an audience because there were people that were playing it. So obviously they know.
6594000	6601000	Honestly, I can't wait for the people who complain all the time about Warcraft Classic to be gone for more than a while.
6601000	6605000	Sorry, I know that makes me sound like a bitch, but it's just the reality.
6605000	6609000	Like, a lot of those attitudes kind of need to go to Classic Island.
6609000	6613000	That's another reason why I fully expect WoW Classic's going to be a dumpster fire.
6613000	6617000	Like, sorry, that's just my opinion.
6618000	6623000	Well, hopefully they'll learn or make some money out of it.
6623000	6631000	I just think Blizzard's burning money because people are going to play Warcraft Classic for like a month and then be like, God, this really was terrible.
6631000	6634000	Why did they do this? I should really go buy all their expansions that they put out.
6634000	6640000	Yeah, maybe they were onto something when they did all these quality of life improvements and so on.
6640000	6642000	What are the graphics going to be in WoW Classic?
6642000	6646000	Because when WoW Classic first came out, we didn't have widescreen monitors.
6646000	6648000	They just don't have graphics.
6648000	6654000	So are they going to permissibly upgrade the graphics and the purists will be okay with that?
6654000	6658000	Or put bars on the side of the screen or what's going to happen?
6658000	6661000	These are the questions I want to know the answer to.
6661000	6664000	Maybe we'll get some answers from Blizzard eventually.
6664000	6670000	In the meantime, just a couple more stories and then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
6670000	6671000	Logie?
6671000	6679000	So you may remember that there was the whole backlash with the loot box situation with Star Wars Battlefront II.
6679000	6687000	And that some senators from various states were kind of getting involved with possibly making legislation to combat it.
6687000	6694000	So one senator that's actually presenting a bill to this is actually a Washington state senator.
6694000	6715000	And Senator Kevin Ranker is actually putting out a bill to investigate whether the items are randomized or not in these different loot boxes and stuff.
6715000	6718000	And whether it can qualify as gambling for children and other things.
6718000	6726000	So they basically had, you know, they're doing some investigation whether the mechanisms can be considered gambling under Washington law.
6726000	6734000	Also if the loot boxes in the games and stuff, if they are considered gambling, if miners should have access to them.
6734000	6743000	And also if there's, you know, lack of disclosure and transparency with respect to the odds of receiving certain items and stuff like that.
6743000	6748000	So they're conducting the research and they're supposed to present their findings by December of this year.
6748000	6752000	And at which time then they'll decide how to proceed from there.
6752000	6756000	So thank you EA for getting that ball rolling.
6756000	6759000	Here come the judge.
6759000	6766000	They just like overstepped the line and it's going to come back to bite you now.
6766000	6769000	I think this loot box scenario is going to look very different in a year's time.
6769000	6771000	I've kind of been saying that.
6771000	6775000	I also think though that they're going to skirt around it somehow though.
6775000	6782000	You know, something, you kind of like how they go around the gambling laws now by the fact that you have to purchase another currency to purchase the loot boxes.
6782000	6785000	Yeah, I guess maybe. We'll see. We'll see.
6785000	6788000	All right, one more story for you guys here tonight.
6788000	6790000	And this is great news.
6790000	6795000	Apparently Hello Kitty Cruisers is going to be coming to the Switch.
6795000	6796000	Yippee!
6796000	6800000	Yay! That game wasn't very good, but it's a Hello Kitty game.
6800000	6802000	There's something that's been out before. Was this on the Wii U?
6802000	6804000	This is on the Wii.
6804000	6806000	Oh, it was on the Wii U?
6806000	6807000	Yeah.
6807000	6808000	No, it was on the Wii U.
6808000	6809000	Yeah.
6809000	6811000	So let's see. I finally got the story to pull up here.
6811000	6816000	So Hello Kitty obviously is like a Mario Kart type of knockoff game, but it's Hello Kitty and friends.
6816000	6819000	And yeah, through a partnership with Sanrio, blah, dee, blah, dee, blah.
6819000	6823000	Hello Kitty video game titles to fans and new audiences.
6823000	6828000	I think 2018 is when they're saying this will come out on the Switch in the US, Canada, and Latin America.
6828000	6835000	So if you have not had the chance to experience Hello Kitty Cruisers, you will get that opportunity.
6835000	6842000	I suppose I could take this opportunity to also mention maybe a game a few more of you are probably interested in.
6842000	6845000	And that's the Secret of Mana remake.
6845000	6850000	So also talking about potentially the Nintendo Switch for that platform.
6850000	6856000	So the PlayStation 4, the Vita, yes Vita, and the PC are getting the Secret of Mana remake.
6856000	6858000	So why not the Nintendo Switch?
6858000	6864000	Well, producer Masaru Omaeda made some comments about that to kind of give background in terms of when the project started.
6864000	6867000	It was about two years ago and the Switch hadn't been announced.
6867000	6875000	Once we had announced this particular remake title, we were very surprised to see the amount of demand and feedback we received for a potential Switch version.
6875000	6877000	So the voices are heard.
6877000	6885000	We're aware that people are desiring a Switch version and we will make an effort to see what's feasible in the future, though nothing is confirmed or planned.
6885000	6893000	So it probably has to do, and you know what it's going to come down to, it's going to come down to how well does it sell on PlayStation 4 and PC and the other platforms.
6893000	6897000	And that may sound weird because, well, but we want it on Switch.
6897000	6901000	But the reality is, they're going to need to pay those teams to port it over to the Switch.
6901000	6906000	Yeah, if it doesn't do well on a platform that has a larger audience then it's not worth porting it over.
6906000	6912000	That's just the reality of it. I know it doesn't logically make sense because there's going to be a lot of you that are like, well, shit, I'm just going to wait for it to come out on the Switch, I'm not going to buy it.
6912000	6919000	But reality is, probably not going to happen if it doesn't sell well enough on the other platforms. So get your friends to buy it on other platforms.
6919000	6927000	Anyhow, the second Atsetsu collection, by the way, you know that came out on the Switch, except we never got it here.
6928000	6937000	Oimada also commented on this saying, obviously our focus is on Secret of Mana since we're in the last part of its development, so obviously it's hard to definitely say yes, we will release it.
6937000	6947000	But we've obviously heard a lot of demands and requests for that game to be released in the West, and that's something we will do our best to hopefully achieve, but nothing at this moment in time.
6947000	6951000	So he's doing a lot of this getting our hopes up shit.
6953000	6961000	Oimada also kind of wondered, are people over here going to get it? Because Second Atsetsu 3 is linked to the Mana series because there was nothing outside.
6961000	6967000	Dude, people will get it. It's fine. If Final Fantasy can be understood over here, you're going to be fine.
6968000	6969000	Yeah.
6969000	6982000	Anyway, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, AkumaJP said, did you know inside Hello Kitty was an old man? He has been the Hello Kitty costume character for 20 years.
6982000	6988000	It doesn't surprise me. They made a whole documentary about the guy who did Elmo.
6988000	6994000	Apparently the guy that was wearing the costume for Barney is now a tantric massage therapist.
6994000	7001000	Yeah, so the people that are putting on the puppet show don't look like the puppets. That's even true with Hello Kitty.
7001000	7003000	They're all in the kinky sex thing, so...
7005000	7006000	Allegedly.
7006000	7007000	Allegedly.
7007000	7015000	Alright. Anyway, Skype line's open, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe something else.
7015000	7019000	I know it's a little early in the show. It ended up being a bit of a shorter show tonight, but without Jamie.
7019000	7024000	And I know the Grammys are happening tonight, which I haven't watched the Grammys in like 20 years.
7024000	7031000	I mean, most of that is thanks to this show being on Sunday nights, but I'm just like, did Meghan Trainor win a Grammy tonight?
7031000	7038000	I think I saw a picture of her holding a Grammy. If she actually, if she won a Grammy, that tells you all you need to know about why I don't watch the Grammys.
7039000	7041000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7041000	7049000	I did hear Patti LuPone showed up, though. I would watch a YouTube of that. But it'll be on YouTube. I don't need to watch it live.
7051000	7055000	Alright. No last minute stories, huh? Sure. Oh, okay, yay.
7055000	7056000	So there's a...
7056000	7059000	Wait, we got a call. Hold that thought, Loki.
7059000	7060000	Hello.
7060000	7063000	We're gonna get to this call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7063000	7064000	What's up, everyone? It's Rama.
7064000	7066000	Hey, Rama. What's on your mind, buddy?
7066000	7074000	A lot of good stuff, but you say Grammys. I say WWE Royal Rumble, so that's where my, that's where part of my priorities were tonight.
7074000	7075000	Is that also on tonight?
7075000	7076000	Yes.
7076000	7085000	See, this might surprise you, but that one I kind of get. Just like, I understand next week is the Super Bowl, and we're a little silly for doing a show anyway.
7085000	7094000	But the reality is, a big part of this audience listens on the podcast, so they're gonna listen when it's convenient for them when there's no major award shows.
7094000	7102000	And we hope the regular Sunday night people that opt to do the Super Bowl thing instead are gonna listen to the show at their convenience through the podcast at some point throughout the week.
7102000	7105000	So, you know, we're still gonna be here doing our thing.
7105000	7113000	That will be me, because I'll be going to a Fuck the Patriots party next week, so you know, that's gonna be good times all around.
7113000	7121000	You know what, you bring up a good point. Like, why do people care about the Super Bowl this time around? Especially, and keep in mind, Rama, I'm coming from a West Coast perspective.
7122000	7130000	You have two teams, and I don't follow the NFL very closely, but my understanding is these two teams are not very well-liked outside of their areas.
7130000	7139000	Pretty much. It's like, next Sunday, all of America, except for the New England State, because we don't count them, will be rooting for the Philadelphia Eagles.
7139000	7141000	Because, like the Red Sox...
7141000	7143000	They're not the Patriots.
7144000	7152000	Look, I am a flaming homosexual man who doesn't care a lot about football, and even I understand that, Rama.
7152000	7156000	See, but I would have figured you'd be watching the Super Bowl for the tight end.
7156000	7163000	No, usually I watch for the halftime concert. You know, the Beyonce concert featuring a football game.
7163000	7168000	The Lady Gaga concert featuring a football game. I don't give a fuck about Justin Timberlake.
7168000	7178000	Okay, alright, alright. I give you that. I give you that. Please, I just don't want to hear all the way in Sacktown, you shouting, yes, queen, all the way.
7178000	7186000	No. That is only going to happen if Janet Jackson takes her rightful place, rightful place, by his side on that stage.
7186000	7192000	And if that doesn't happen, I don't give a fuck. I don't give one fuck, two fucks, red fucks, blue fucks.
7192000	7200000	Unless Janet Jackson gets her rightful place and her fucking apology from the NFL. I'm sorry, I'm on my fucking soapbox now.
7200000	7211000	Janet Jackson deserves a fucking apology from the NFL, from CBS, from the entire fucking country, owes Janet Jackson a huge apology.
7211000	7219000	Jesus Christ, what did I do? I think I just actually summoned Rob Skinner's sass. Holy shit.
7219000	7221000	I'm sorry, I'm on a bender tonight. What can I say?
7221000	7232000	It's all good, because we all love it when you get sassy like that. We love it. After you get sassy, we just hand you back your crown and be like, here, sorry, we're sorry, we'll touch it again.
7232000	7238000	Rama, it was a titty, and everybody went fucking nuts. It was a titty.
7238000	7244000	Oh, I just remember what Chris Rock said about that, but that's a story for another time.
7244000	7248000	It's not like y'all ain't looking up titties anyway.
7249000	7255000	She accidentally put one out there for free, and it was still covered by that weird fucking metal thing.
7255000	7264000	And you can't tell me that, like, who is it that, like, there's been several costumes, like, even during these award shows, where it's just, like, Boob just fucking hanging out.
7264000	7269000	And Lil' Kim at the MTV Awards. Like, her outfit was her tit.
7270000	7279000	The nipple wasn't showing. The nipple wasn't showing. The nipple was in the middle.
7279000	7282000	Oh, is that where they are, Loki?
7282000	7286000	No, they had the thing over it, but it was pierced through that or something. I don't know.
7286000	7292000	She had that metal thing on. You couldn't even see it. We didn't even fucking have HD then. That's the thing.
7292000	7293000	I don't know.
7293000	7294000	It wasn't even HD.
7294000	7307000	Let's go back to what I was talking about earlier this week. So, apparently, I was going through my old computer stuff, and I have all my LiveJournal icons, and someone had made me a LiveJournal icon that was Janet Jackson's nipple thing with my name on it.
7307000	7312000	And so, yes, it was there, because it's blown up to a LiveJournal icon.
7312000	7316000	I don't remember her full nipple being on display, but even if it was...
7316000	7320000	It was on TV, and it was super, like, zoom in on that shit.
7320000	7329000	Go to a beach in France, for fuck's sake. God. Anyway, sorry, Rami. I know you didn't call in to talk about titties, but, you know.
7329000	7333000	Yeah, well, it's all good. I'm not gonna complain.
7333000	7334000	Wait, what's that?
7334000	7337000	It's all good. You know, I'm not gonna complain.
7337000	7342000	Alright, sounds good. Wait, was there something actually video gaming related we were supposed to be talking about?
7343000	7348000	Yeah, I wanted to talk about a couple things now. The Duke Nukem movie. Okay.
7348000	7354000	John St. John, the voice of Duke Nukem. Oh, he is thoroughly pissed.
7354000	7361000	He has started a grassroots campaign to have somebody else play John Cena.
7361000	7373000	Now, some people don't remember, but about a good 15, nearly 20 years ago, there was talk of a Duke Nukem movie, right after Duke Nukem 3D.
7373000	7381000	It was supposed to be with Brian Bonsworth. But, as you can see, that kinda felt flat on its face.
7381000	7384000	Right, as a lot of movies never do get off the ground.
7385000	7393000	It is what it is. I mean, honestly, Cena has it all, except for the personality. That's basically it.
7393000	7399000	Unfortunately, I mean, this is the reality of Hollywood, and I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way it is.
7399000	7408000	John St. John doesn't have that name recognition that John Cena does. He will be lucky if he gets a cameo in the movie after this. He should hope for a cameo.
7408000	7409000	Basically.
7409000	7416000	And I'm not saying I agree with it, I'm just saying, that's what happens in Hollywood. If you don't like it, don't see the movie.
7418000	7429000	Basically. Now, about the whole streaming thing you all were talking about earlier. I'll tell you this, between different platforms, I find streaming to Facebook Live is like the easiest thing.
7429000	7430000	Really?
7430000	7445000	Like, webcam, fire it up, that's it. It's so easy. I mean, that's what a lot of people I see at conventions are doing. Like, they got their booth set up, they just fire up Facebook Live and just run the stream. It's just that simple. You don't need any special software.
7445000	7449000	That's fair. The ease of doing it is certainly a big part of it.
7450000	7461000	But there are a couple of websites out there where if you use them as the proxy, and you program it, it'll stream to other streaming sites as well. Makes it look easy, which I think is a great idea.
7461000	7476000	You know what's interesting though, if you're a Twitch affiliate, you can't use stuff like that. Because the content you put on Twitch, I hope I'm not screwing up the agreement, but the content you put on Twitch has to be exclusive to Twitch for 24 hours.
7476000	7483000	So you can still put your backups on YouTube the next day or whatever, but it has to be exclusive to Twitch for 24 hours. You can't do that multi stream stuff.
7483000	7496000	They also, they do not bar you from using other streaming services. You can use Facebook and you can use Mixer. They're not gonna, you know, that would be, I think a lot of people would have a problem with that if they were to close all your other doors.
7496000	7503000	But you can't stream the same thing you're doing on Twitch to these other platforms. That's actually in their agreement. Just a thing you may not know about.
7503000	7511000	Now obviously not everybody is an affiliate or a partner, but it does seem like they're letting more and more people get in on that affiliate program. So just something to consider.
7511000	7515000	You know what, I personally don't have a problem with that.
7515000	7521000	Rami, you're cutting out a little bit. All I heard was that I don't have a problem with it.
7521000	7525000	My bad. I guess, let me, let me, let me turn up the porn torrents. I'm sorry.
7525000	7528000	Okay. Do you say the porn torrents?
7528000	7529000	Yes I do.
7529000	7530000	Okay.
7530000	7542000	I mean, personally, I don't have a problem with waiting 24 hours because I go to conventions, let's say I'm recording panels or live stream or something like that, like the Masquerade.
7542000	7550000	I'm not gonna mess with the footage until I get back Monday or Tuesday. So by all means, enjoy it.
7550000	7551000	Yeah.
7552000	7560000	And honestly with Twitch, like if you want to watch stuff like, like the DDR tournament yesterday, it's not on YouTube yet, but just go to dude's Twitch archive. It's all there.
7560000	7566000	And people are even making clips already. And even when I was watching today, I accidentally hit that clip.
7566000	7572000	But that's one thing I don't like about Twitch is that if you accidentally hit that clip button, then you just made like a garbage clip of some of these feed.
7572000	7576000	But anyway, my point is that you can watch that stuff on demand right away.
7576000	7581000	And Bobby's pointing out another change that's happened to Twitch lately saying, I'm ready to go full on Twitch at this point.
7581000	7588000	Apparently you can upload videos and debut them at a specific time on Twitch now and then have a group viewing party.
7588000	7599000	That is true. Twitch is trying to kind of push into YouTube space there a little bit, but they're still trying to keep it live by like your new video debuts at this time.
7599000	7605000	But if you're not super into that concept, you can set the debut time as like 30 minutes from after you upload it.
7605000	7608000	I think the minimum is like on the half hour after you upload it.
7608000	7610000	I think that's pretty cool.
7610000	7619000	I do too. I think it's neat. It's a concept I may explore more. I gotta be careful what I promise I deliver, especially since I'm doing the three podcast thing.
7619000	7625000	But obviously Twitch is something I do still definitely want to expand on when time permits.
7625000	7630000	It kind of makes your Twitch stream sort of like your own independent TV station if you think about it.
7630000	7631000	Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
7632000	7637000	So I haven't really played around with Twitch that much, but I got a couple of projects in the works.
7637000	7642000	But right now I may just stick with Facebook Live just to see how it works.
7642000	7643000	Sure.
7643000	7644000	Well, we'll see.
7644000	7645000	We'll see.
7645000	7651000	Also, another thing with Twitch, if you're if you're worried about the barrier to entry, you might want to check out this was just released.
7652000	7661000	Streamlabs just released their own version of Open Broadcast Studio, OBS, which is like the very popular streaming software.
7661000	7666000	And a lot of people kind of find that software, it's not exactly the easiest thing in the world to use.
7666000	7670000	So some people get intimidated by that. You have to kind of watch some tutorials to get the sense of it.
7670000	7674000	But I think Streamlabs version has a lot of built in stuff already.
7675000	7685000	Now, my disclaimer, I actually haven't used this myself yet, but I'm curious to check it out because Streamlabs, they're the ones that are doing a lot of the overlays that people are already using.
7685000	7692000	For example, when somebody clicks the subscribe button and I get that little gif that comes up that says, you know, Rama just subscribed to your station.
7692000	7694000	So I can go, yay, thank you, Rama.
7694000	7699000	You know, that is all from Streamlabs is that basically you have to import Streamlabs website into your feed to get that to display.
7699000	7704000	Well, now that Streamlabs basically has its own studio software, it's all kind of integrated.
7704000	7707000	So it's going to make that process, I think, easier for some people.
7707000	7711000	So just to kind of piggyback on what you said about people are using Facebook because it's easier.
7711000	7714000	Some people are recognizing that about Twitch.
7714000	7716000	That's a little more difficult to just jump in and do.
7716000	7719000	So maybe some of those walls are going to come down.
7719000	7727000	Yeah, hopefully, because if you're using Streamlabs or something like that, you have to have a decent power desktop or laptop to use it.
7727000	7734000	Whereas with Facebook Live, I mean, I have a Surface 3 laptop and that's an Atom processor.
7734000	7737000	I can use that and just jump right on live and just rock and roll.
7737000	7739000	Yeah, for sure.
7739000	7745000	All right. Well, Rama, I'm going to let you go because we've been on a call a little while, but I want to make sure we free it up for some other folks.
7745000	7748000	But I hope everybody listens to Anime Jam Session.
7748000	7750000	And thanks for calling, as always.
7750000	7752000	Yeah, cool. No problem. Keep it real, bro.
7752000	7754000	All right. I always do. Take care, buddy.
7754000	7755000	You too. Bye.
7755000	7758000	OrangeLoungeRadio all one word on Skype.
7758000	7761000	Loki, you were starting to do a last minute story and I cut you off.
7761000	7767000	Yes. So there is this Kickstarter for an application called NES Maker.
7767000	7772000	So basically what is NES Maker? It's making NES games without coding.
7772000	7775000	We did bring this up on the show last week, just so you know. Sorry.
7775000	7778000	That's awesome. And they've already hit their goal and they're...
7778000	7779000	Oh, they hit their goal?
7779000	7781000	Yeah, they're way over their goal.
7781000	7784000	They're 139,000 of their 32,000 goal.
7784000	7789000	So the newest, last time I checked this, their new goal was the music maker part of it.
7789000	7796000	But they've hit like a bunch of stretch goals, adventure module, platformer, RPG, brawler and shooter modules have been...
7796000	7798000	Dude, that music maker is going to be awesome.
7798000	7803000	You know, I kind of had to force myself to learn GarageBand because Victoria and I were like,
7803000	7806000	where are we going to get an intro for our new show?
7806000	7810000	And I was like, I really kind of want to get away from using existing songs.
7810000	7812000	I'm like, how hard can GarageBand be?
7812000	7817000	I said, Slagkick from Gamebooie told me he made the intro to R.I.F. in GarageBand.
7817000	7819000	So how hard can GarageBand be?
7819000	7824000	So I actually like tried to force myself to like learn how to use GarageBand and make loops.
7824000	7828000	But what you may not know is that Victoria did the same thing.
7828000	7832000	And the intro you're actually hearing to Shaky and Crying is the one she did.
7832000	7839000	So it was better. I couldn't get away from it sounding like the stock footage thing.
7840000	7846000	But anyway, the reason why I bring that up is that if they bring out an NES maker that's similar to like GarageBand
7846000	7851000	and, you know, kind of putting stuff together, that could be really cool for people that want to do more Chiptune stuff.
7851000	7855000	Yeah, I do want to check this out. It seems like a neat idea. I don't know.
7856000	7861000	I'm not interested necessarily in the module that actually dump it to a cart, so I don't have an NES.
7861000	7866000	As is my reservation with most Kickstarters in the year 2018,
7866000	7870000	but I really hope this team is able to deliver the product they're promising.
7870000	7877000	You'll have to excuse me if I am extremely skeptical in the year 2018.
7877000	7881000	Yeah, I understand. At least the target date's not until August.
7881000	7884000	I mean, that's not that far away, but, you know, that's a good pushback.
7884000	7886000	All right, good luck.
7886000	7887000	Any other last minute stories?
7887000	7891000	Yeah, apparently during the whole like I think Dota event that was going on,
7891000	7895000	there was a Valve presentation and one of the first things that people were asking
7895000	7899000	for, Half-Life 3, they said was, yeah, we're still making games and people laughed
7899000	7901000	because they didn't believe them, but apparently they're still making games.
7901000	7903000	Oh, well, okay. Who knew?
7903000	7905000	Just some day we'll hear about them.
7907000	7908000	That's all I got.
7908000	7911000	All right, OrangeLoungeRadio, one more shout out for the Skypline.
7911000	7914000	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
7914000	7917000	Rama in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
7917000	7920000	Carrie Fisher wins the Grammy posthumously.
7920000	7923000	That's the only relevance to the Grammys. Fair enough.
7924000	7931000	MXC says OBS is still open source, so it seems the Streamlabs thing is built on top of the OBS engine
7931000	7934000	and that's okay because OBS is open source. Yes, true.
7935000	7941000	That OBS really killed, what was the other big one people had to use before it?
7941000	7944000	It was X something. People had XSplit, I think.
7944000	7947000	And they wanted to charge quite a bit of money for it and they still do.
7947000	7948000	I think it's still out there.
7948000	7952000	They're probably trying to give you some reason to keep it.
7952000	7956000	But man, OBS, I mean, it's free and it's pretty easy to use, I think.
7956000	7962000	But I also, keep in mind, when I was in college, I was actually studying like television
7962000	7967000	and I did things like edit a music video and edit some of those jokes from Understation Live
7967000	7971000	that were the mini movies that I was in that some of you, I'm reaching here,
7971000	7973000	but some of you that have been listening to the show a long time know what I'm talking about.
7973000	7977000	Some of those in-jokes from Understation Live, those things that were college projects
7977000	7982000	that we were editing. So my point with that is a lot of those same concepts and things
7982000	7985000	were like on the software we were using then that are in OBS.
7985000	7988000	So it's not that hard for me to use.
7988000	7993000	But anyway, we do have another call coming in, so I'm going to get to it if it will load here.
7993000	7995000	I think it's taking us time to connect.
7995000	7997000	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's this?
7998000	7999000	Hey, it's dark. Good to see you.
7999000	8001000	Hey, we haven't heard from you in a while. How are you?
8001000	8004000	Well, I mean, you're always in chat. We don't get to Skype with you much.
8004000	8005000	What's on your mind?
8006000	8008000	Oh, just a couple of quick things.
8008000	8010000	Yeah. Go for it.
8010000	8017000	Hey, quick question for Loki. Did you happen to find anything on that hard drive when you were transferring?
8019000	8022000	Like find what? I found all my mix show stuff.
8023000	8032000	Yeah, anything like OLR related because I guess Missy had asked about it on Twitter. I don't know if you saw that.
8032000	8036000	Oh, they're looking for Orange Laundry Radio archive stuff.
8036000	8038000	Yeah, I didn't keep any of the episodes.
8038000	8042000	Yeah, no, he never had episode masters. That was really all me.
8042000	8051000	And yeah, I assure you between Missy and DDR Angel and some of the other big collectors, you guys had it all.
8051000	8057000	Everything. In fact, when Missy was here, I dumped everything from my archives and gave it to her.
8057000	8063000	So yeah, unfortunately, there are a handful of episodes that are just they're gone right now.
8064000	8065000	Yeah.
8067000	8073000	But the good news is, I mean, like most honestly, it's probably only at most like 50 episodes that are gone.
8073000	8077000	Like there's still a whole time. And who knows that they might turn up someday.
8077000	8083000	I still have old computers sitting around here. And if I find some old hard drives, I'll take a look for you. You never know.
8083000	8088000	That's okay. Because if we miss some of the old episodes, then I'll make my presidential run easier later on.
8090000	8094000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says those were the best 50 episodes, obviously.
8094000	8102000	Excuse me, you're listening to the best episode happening right now and the 49 before it, obviously. Thank you.
8104000	8107000	No, she had pinged me on Twitter. So I thought I'd act about that.
8107000	8110000	Appreciate it. Well, anything else on your mind, Dr. Tzuyu?
8111000	8117000	Just one quick thing. Did you know that President Cat had made her Twitch debut late last year?
8118000	8123000	No, like as an actual streamer or somebody playing the game.
8124000	8128000	Yeah, someone was playing the game this late last year.
8129000	8136000	I knew about the retro streamer guy because you sent us a tweet on it.
8136000	8143000	And I had something else going on IRL, so I wasn't able to watch it live. But I know somebody did do it. I did see the tweets about it.
8144000	8150000	Yeah, that's Retro Pals on Twitch. I do recommend checking them out. They play a lot of older stuff.
8151000	8157000	I have nothing against Retro Pals. I'm sure they're an awesome stream and the fact that you like them I'm sure makes them awesome and good.
8158000	8165000	But I seem to recall, Loki, did we not broadcast President Cat when you bought it on Justin TV back in the day?
8166000	8167000	Because we were in the studio set up.
8168000	8169000	Maybe. I don't remember.
8170000	8171000	I feel like we did. Because I know we played it.
8172000	8173000	I'd still have it somewhere.
8174000	8181000	I think we did, Dr. Tzuyu. I don't know if they did it first. They might be the first to do it on Twitch, though, because when we were streaming it was on Justin.
8181000	8182000	Yeah. Oh yeah.
8183000	8184000	So.
8185000	8191000	Alright, well my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can see if we can get any more calls. But thanks so much for calling. It's always a pleasure to hear from you.
8192000	8193000	Yeah, sure.
8194000	8195000	Take care.
8196000	8197000	Yep, thank you.
8198000	8202000	Alright. OrangeLounge Radio, all one word on Skype if we get any last minute. You got a call right now because I'm about to close it up.
8203000	8206000	Loki, anything else to note here?
8207000	8208000	No.
8208000	8218000	No? I noticed Mr. Smoosh has come out into the studio and made himself known. He wants to get some pets from Loki and probably wants to get some food too at some point.
8219000	8225000	That's usually why he wakes up from his nap. Hopefully will not keep me awake at all hours of the night. This is the latest thing he likes to do.
8226000	8230000	If the blinds are pulled in the bedroom, which, you know, we don't like to have the sunlight in. The blinds are usually pulled.
8231000	8236000	He will jump up on the windowsill and start clawing at the blinds so he can see through them.
8236000	8240000	Oh yeah, I remember my cat used to do that. Trying to get it behind the blinds.
8241000	8250000	Annoying. Annoying. And then last night his snoring was so loud that Alan ended up going out to the couch.
8251000	8260000	Because he couldn't sleep through Mr. Smoosh's snoring. He snores so loud. He didn't already know Mr. Smoosh is my cat.
8260000	8265000	Alright, well that's it. No more calls are coming in so I think we're going to wrap up the show.
8266000	8268000	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry Radio.
8269000	8274000	Hey, as we say every week on the show, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.
8275000	8281000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but if you guys aren't out there, we can't get your voices on here.
8282000	8286000	Always appreciate having some new voices here at Orange Laundry Radio.
8286000	8291000	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play or wherever it is you found this show.
8292000	8297000	That goes a very long way so we really appreciate those where you can do that.
8298000	8303000	That really does it for the show. I guess it's time for final thoughts. Loki, any final thoughts you want to get out?
8304000	8314000	I'm going to hopefully keep playing DDR and see about foam modding those pads because that's only like 20 bucks to do that so I may start that this week.
8314000	8321000	Alright, and I guess my final thought is Mr. Smoosh wants me to take more pictures for his Instagram, huh? Yeah.
8322000	8325000	Mr. Smoosh likes being a celebrity, doesn't he? You spoiled kitty.
8326000	8331000	We'll be back in seven days. Hopefully Jamie's back and we can all do this again here at Orange Laundry Radio.
8332000	8338000	Thanks so much for tuning in tonight. We'll see you next Sunday. I am aware there is a big football game on but we'll still be here nevertheless.
8338000	8344000	So join us either on the podcast feed or be here live because I'm pretty sure the football game ends before we do.
8345000	8347000	So come join us. We'll see you in seven days. Have a good night.
