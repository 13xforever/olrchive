7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	This week, childhood game store Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy proceedings, and in its wake, our next retail savior will be KB Toys?
20000	27000	Apparently, retail toy stores are still viable, so stay tuned for this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, March 18th, 2017 with episode number 723 of our show.
45000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my pals, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54000	55000	Sup?
55000	56000	Hi, welcome back.
56000	56500	Hi.
56500	65500	And thank you, by the way. DarkSakura actually did the very brave task of setting foot in a Walmart to help me expand my collection I have growing over here.
65500	73500	I say over here like it's a video show, but I have a growing collection over here of classic video games and drag queens.
73500	81500	And I say that because I have stacked side by side some arcade minis. I guess there's this, I think that's what they're actually called, arcade minis.
82500	83500	Arcade classics.
83500	90500	Yeah, arcade classics. And they're like, I have Joust, Rampage, Centipede, Frogger. So you actually found these at a Walmart and texted me.
90500	92500	Apparently you're missing quite a few because they are numbered.
92500	98500	They are numbered, but some of them are not as good. Here's the thing, 1 and 2 were like a different screen and they're terrible.
98500	105500	Number 5 is a redo of Pac-Man, which was number 1, I think, that uses the nicer screen. So I think that's the one I'm actually missing.
105500	109500	I don't know that the Pac-Man has the nicer screen though. I think it's still not the LCD.
109500	110500	Yeah.
110500	111500	Because these are all LCD screens.
111500	116500	Yeah. And then Asteroids is also missing, but Asteroids also has a crappy screen.
116500	117500	It does.
117500	119500	So these are just the good machines.
119500	125500	And we started off that Dan had gone to a bunch of different Walmarts to look for them and I stopped by the one that just happens to be on the way home.
125500	129500	And they had everything. So I got them before the show.
129500	130500	Yeah.
130500	133500	I came here, you wanted them, so I went back and got some.
133500	134500	Thank you.
134500	135500	You're welcome.
135500	143500	But this time, we talked about that on the last show that I was here, and I was like, I wonder if that same one that no one goes to has it.
143500	151500	So I said, hey, if I find them, do you want them? And you're like, yes. And we already had one of the ones, so I only bought the two that we were missing.
151500	155500	And then I bought you the three that you didn't have. So.
155500	162500	Yeah. So I may, if I can find them online or something for a reasonable price. I ain't paying scalpel prices.
162500	166500	I may get the Pac-Man and the Asteroids just to be a completionist.
166500	170500	If you just go to the Folsom one, they have them all sitting there. No one buys them there.
170500	175500	The first two are crap. I actually know somebody who has the Pac-Man, the original number one.
175500	177500	It looks like a Game & Watch game.
177500	178500	Yeah.
178500	183500	The screen's completely different. So they're not very good. But ever since they switched these color LCDs, they look really nice.
183500	194500	Oh, and by the way, you might wonder why I said classic games and drag queens, because on top of the boxes for the classic games, I have the Funko for RuPaul, Alaska, Thunderfun, and Trixie Mattel.
194500	200500	Which are so far the only drag queen Funkos that I know of until they inevitably release a Bianca Del Rio one, I'm sure.
200500	204500	An Itakatia and a Bendelacrum.
204500	206500	And I hope a Peppermint, because I just love Peppermint.
206500	208500	And a Shangela. I love Shangela.
208500	212500	Oh, no, wait till we get to the FUs of the week later this year.
212500	213500	Yeah.
213500	216500	All right, anyway, so welcome back to our soccer. We missed you last week.
216500	217500	Thank you.
217500	220500	And of course, you've already been hearing Techmaster Loki joining us, as he always does.
220500	221500	Hello.
221500	222500	Hi, how are you?
222500	223500	I'm fine.
223500	224500	Yeah, how's that?
224500	225500	I wish I hadn't eaten that pizza, though.
225500	227500	Oh, well, yeah, you brought like a $5 pizza to the show, right?
227500	228500	Yeah, you can taste the $5.
228500	230500	Yeah, I was like, you get what you pay for.
230500	231500	You get what you pay for.
231500	232500	You get what you pay for.
232500	238500	I needed something to eat, because if I got like, you know, one of my low calorie things, I haven't eaten much today at all.
238500	244500	So I was like behind by like 1,500 calories. Yeah, I went through that 1,500 calories really fast.
244500	252500	Anyway, I want to say hi to our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network.
252500	255500	vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
255500	259500	And I do want to acknowledge, because there's a lot of people in chat complaining about the constant drops.
259500	265500	Unfortunately, this was happening during the Bobby Blackwell show as well, so this is not something we can control on our end.
265500	268500	This is something that's happening with our hosting end.
268500	271500	And I don't know about you guys, I'm getting a little sick of this, and I know Bobby is too.
271500	276500	And all I can say for right now is we do have a plan that we are going to be changing this up.
276500	280500	We're not going to be sticking with this provider long term, because this has been going on.
280500	283500	We've just been having these weird problems way too long.
283500	288500	So I can't say anything else about that right now, but I just will say I'm acknowledging that frustration.
289500	295500	We have to continue to push forward for the sake of the recording, because we have a lot of people that listen to this on the podcast feed.
295500	298500	So it would sound really terrible if I kept stopping every five seconds.
298500	300500	Oh, it's stream dropped. Oh, it's stream dropped.
300500	301500	So we are going to push through.
301500	306500	But I do genuinely feel bad, because I know you guys take time out of your schedule to be here on Sunday night.
306500	311500	Although some of you multitask, you game, and you listen to the show, so I do really appreciate that.
311500	316500	But yeah, we're not going to be here live for the next two weeks.
316500	322500	So it really sucks that like our last week before we're on a two week break, this bullshit's going on.
322500	324500	So it's really frustrating. Sorry guys.
324500	329500	But yeah, as I've mentioned for a little while now, I will not be here next week.
329500	333500	There's not going to be a live show or a podcast next week, because I'm going to be gone for too many days.
333500	337500	I'm going to a wedding, so I will be gone for a little while.
337500	339500	And I think you all know who it is at this point.
339500	341500	So that is what's happening next week.
342500	349500	And then in two weeks, because April 1st happens to be the same day as Easter, there's not going to be a live show that day,
349500	354500	because my co-hosts both have family commitments that day, and that is no fun.
354500	355500	Family?
355500	356500	Oh well.
356500	357500	I'm doing drag queen stuff.
357500	358500	Family.
358500	362500	I'm going to see my sisters.
362500	367500	To quote RuPaul, we as gay people, and that's the whole quilt bag, get to choose our families.
367500	368500	You find your tribe.
368500	369500	That's right.
369500	378500	But no, for anyone who's in the area, I will be going to the Sisters in the Park for the Easter and the Hunky Jesus,
378500	381500	and what's the other one, the Magnificent Mary or something.
381500	385500	But yeah, it's not at Dolores Park this year though, but I'll be there.
385500	387500	So come find me. I'll be the short one.
387500	388500	Okay, cool.
388500	389500	Because I'm short.
389500	390500	So yeah, and that is no joke.
390500	391500	With real boobs.
391500	392500	But we are going to try.
392500	398500	So the good news is, since that's just a day long thing, we are going to try to pre-record something in advance for that.
398500	403500	So that way, at least the podcast won't go two weeks with no show, because I hate going that long without a show.
403500	404500	You all know that.
404500	408500	So anyway, I guess some people that are listening live are actually able to reconnect again.
408500	412500	So because of the drops, they missed the whole apology of me going out of my way to say,
412500	414500	I'm sorry, the live stream keeps dropping.
414500	416500	It's nothing we can do.
416500	420500	It's our service provider, and we will be leaving that service provider this year.
420500	426500	I can't say anything more at this point, but things and stuff.
427500	429500	Alright, let's move on though.
429500	431500	We're going to talk about our kickoff topic tonight.
431500	433500	I'm going to throw it over to you, Loki.
433500	435500	What's going on in our kickoff topic tonight?
435500	439500	Okay, well we can talk about cross-play.
439500	445500	And we're talking about not necessarily dressing up like the opposite gendered character.
445500	446500	Although that's fun too.
446500	447500	That's also fun.
447500	455500	No, but we're talking about the whole drama with Sony and Microsoft playing nice so that you can be able to play games across platforms.
455500	458500	Much like you can do with Nintendo and stuff like that and PC.
458500	466500	So Microsoft, they're interested, of course, in getting Fortnite to play well with the PlayStation 4 as well.
466500	471500	And of course, Epic Games, the company that makes it as well, is also interested in that.
471500	478500	So basically, one of the fans of Fortnite tweeted, saying,
478500	484500	I wanted to ask, can Xbox One and PlayStation 4 players play together in Fortnite?
484500	488500	We really want cross-play system between Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
488500	493500	And Phil Spencer of Microsoft replied saying, yeah, me too.
493500	497500	And the Fortnite account said, yeah, we three.
497500	499500	And Sony said nothing.
499500	503500	Because they've been reluctant to do cross-play.
503500	505500	As long as they've been in the lead, they don't have to.
505500	508500	Or they feel they don't have to.
508500	509500	Right.
509500	513500	So basically, kind of stating what's already known,
513500	519500	we've worked closely before with Nintendo to allow cross-play network on the Xbox One and the Switch.
519500	524500	And offered to do the same for PlayStation 4 players, still holds.
524500	527500	But right now, it's kind of in Sony's court.
527500	530500	And let's be clear, cross-play is not a technical issue.
530500	536500	Cross-play has existed between Sony and Microsoft and PC ever since Final Fantasy XI.
536500	537500	It's literally flipping a Switch.
537500	541500	In fact, it was enabled accidentally for it, wasn't it?
544500	548500	You're right, it was enabled accidentally for something that was Switch.
548500	549500	Was it Fortnite?
549500	550500	It was Rocket League, wasn't it?
550500	551500	Rocket League, okay.
551500	553500	I think it was Rocket League had it accidentally for a little bit.
553500	554500	So I think, don't quote me on that.
554500	558500	But yeah, this is not a technical issue whatsoever.
558500	564500	Because again, Final Fantasy XI, Microsoft was desperate to get Square Enix on their platform
564500	566500	when they were releasing the Xbox 360.
566500	570500	So they took on Final Fantasy XI because Square wanted more subscribers, right?
570500	574500	So Sony already had Final Fantasy XI up and running on the PlayStation 2,
574500	578500	which had already been cross-played with the PC people, which was a big deal.
578500	581500	In fact, probably more people were playing Final Fantasy XI on PC in the US,
581500	586500	although Japan had a huge install base on the PS2 in Japan.
586500	588500	And then the Xbox 360 came out.
588500	590500	I don't think Final Fantasy XI ever really caught fire there,
590500	591500	but there were certainly people that were playing it there.
591500	594500	Just like, there were people playing it on PS2 in the US,
594500	596500	but most people were kind of here or there.
596500	602500	Obviously, that is no longer because they decided to close the PS2 and the 360 versions.
602500	605500	Final Fantasy XI only exists on PC now.
605500	611500	But anyway, so long story short, again, these games are able to be cross-played
611500	615500	if they want to do it with minimal difficulty.
615500	619500	I mean, I'm sure the programming has to be changed around to be able to talk to PlayStation.
619500	621500	From what I hear, it's just, it's basically flipping a switch.
621500	623500	Yeah, it's not hard. It's not hard.
623500	629500	So, let me ask this. How important is it for people to be able to play together?
629500	637500	Like, is there a good reason why maybe there shouldn't be cross-play in a game?
637500	641500	I think it would just help with keeping the game's numbers up and everything,
641500	644500	so you don't have the fragmentation between platforms.
644500	647500	Especially with something like, say, you're playing Overwatch.
647500	650500	It's like, okay, well, which system do I get it for?
650500	652500	Because I have friends that are playing on Xbox.
652500	654500	I have friends that are playing on PlayStation.
654500	656500	I have friends that are playing on PC.
656500	661500	I guess I buy it three times, but then your progression isn't really carried between them.
661500	665500	So, it would just be nice to be able to have that simpler.
665500	668500	But companies aren't necessarily interested.
668500	671500	That's something I'm going through personally, too, with Overwatch,
671500	673500	because I do play a lot of Overwatch, and it does suck,
673500	677500	because I have to have a PlayStation 4 version and a PC version
677500	680500	so I can play with my friend groups on both systems.
680500	684500	Now, there's still other people I know that play on Xbox One,
684500	688500	and it's like I just really don't get to play with them until the free weekend.
688500	692500	Usually when Overwatch does a free weekend, then I'll go to Xbox One for that weekend.
692500	695500	I understand. They're thinking, well, if we give them ground on this,
695500	697500	then people don't need to buy a PlayStation 4,
697500	701500	because they can just buy an Xbox or whatever and play there.
701500	705500	But my thing is, well, then, that same can be said for the Xbox One.
705500	708500	Oh, I don't need to buy an Xbox One, because I can have a PlayStation 4 and do that.
708500	712500	So it really comes down to what else is driving people to your platform.
712500	718500	And if you feel like your platform isn't worthy enough to garner those sales,
718500	721500	even though you're allowing this for certain games.
721500	724500	I mean, it's not going to be a ton of games. It's just a few games.
724500	728500	That seems a little petty, that you're just like, oh, well,
728500	731500	we're not very confident in our platform, so we're going to hold this.
731500	736500	Or the most transparent excuses I've heard are the ones about
736500	740500	they can't control the users on the other people's platform type of thing.
740500	741500	You remember that excuse?
741500	743500	You can't control the users on your own platform. What are you talking about?
743500	745500	Yeah, that is the most transparent excuse.
745500	749500	I think control and users are two words that don't go great together.
749500	752500	Yeah, like none of the platforms, none of them,
752500	755500	have been able to successfully control their user base.
755500	758500	There are toxic people on all of those platforms.
758500	761500	That excuse is bullshit, and we all see right through it, so drop it.
761500	764500	What we need to do is we need to have Steven Spielberg come in
764500	768500	and tell them to play nice, because that's how they got so many of the pop culture stuff.
768500	773500	They got fucking Star Wars shit in there, playing with fucking Warner Brothers
773500	776500	and Universal and all this shit together.
776500	779500	Because everybody wants a piece of Steven Spielberg.
779500	785500	Exactly. So Steven Spielberg has to say, hey, guys need to do some cross play here.
785500	787500	And they'd be like, okay, fine.
787500	793500	Maybe Steven Spielberg needs to offer to direct an Overwatch movie, but on one condition.
793500	795500	Well, here's the thing with Overwatch. Here's the other thing.
795500	801500	This is probably in the whole cross play disabling and the whole type of argument.
801500	806500	This is one of the few like, okay, that might be a good reason to disable cross play.
806500	811500	Is that with Overwatch, one of the reasons why Blizzard has said they do not have cross play
811500	817500	between PC and PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is because PC has keyboard and mouse,
817500	820500	and the consoles have the controllers.
820500	825500	Now, there's a part of me that thinks they ought to just allow keyboard and mouse support on the consoles.
825500	827500	They could. It's just USB.
827500	829500	They could, but they would not.
829500	834500	But, well, Blizzard, I mean, I understand the keyboard and mouse are optional,
834500	836500	and so they're going to cost more money and so forth.
836500	840500	Blizzard really seems to think that keyboard and mouse is going to have a huge advantage
840500	843500	over people playing on console.
843500	847500	I bet some console people would beg to differ, but that is the line they're sticking to.
847500	852500	Well, that's fine, and it's split up between controller and keyboard and mouse.
852500	856500	Did you know some things are balanced differently because Blizzard believes so strongly in this?
856500	862500	Like the turrets that Symmetra and Torbjorn use, they are actually weaker on a,
862500	870500	I think on the PC they're weaker versus the consoles because the thought is you can aim better on the PCs
870500	873500	because it's mouse and keyboard than you can on the consoles.
873500	875500	So the auto aim assists too much.
875500	879500	Maybe it's the other way around. I don't remember what it is, but I know they're balanced differently
879500	882500	because they feel that the aiming is stronger on PC,
882500	888500	and so they don't want the turrets and all that doing all the work for you, basically.
888500	891500	Because, especially when the game first came out,
891500	895500	Torbjorn felt really overpowered because his turret would murder everybody
895500	898500	if you didn't know how to kill it, basically.
898500	900500	So.
900500	902500	Anyway.
903500	911500	So, any other reasons you guys can think of why maybe a console or a game maker should
911500	915500	consider keeping crossplay separate between the two platforms?
915500	917500	No.
917500	919500	Not really, not logically.
919500	923500	I just think that they're just going to hold off on it until their system isn't doing as well.
923500	925500	And that's unfortunate.
925500	929500	And honestly though, after seeing how this generation has kind of played out with
929500	932500	some of the backwards compatibility and mod support and stuff like that,
932500	935500	yeah, if I had to do it again, I'd probably just pick up an Xbox One.
935500	940500	Because it is disappointing to see that, oh, we're not willing to play ball with a ton of things.
940500	945500	And I think what it is, is they were worried so much about that hack back then
945500	948500	that they were just like, oh, we can't open ourselves up to anything.
948500	952500	Whether it be potential for hacks through mods,
952500	956500	or the potential for some sort of drama with
956500	960500	people being unregulated on chat or something like that.
960500	964500	I don't know what the case is, but they're making a lot of excuses and not doing anything.
964500	967500	And also backwards compatibility. Come on, where the fuck is that shit?
967500	969500	You know what's really fascinating to me?
969500	974500	You know where I never hear of cross-platform multiplayer being an issue?
974500	976500	Is in the cell phone universe.
976500	982500	Can you imagine if iPhone and Android went to that type of battle
982500	986500	where the separate platforms had to be on separate services or whatever?
986500	993500	Can you imagine iPhone Ingress and Android Ingress being completely separate games and separate universes?
993500	995500	That would be really interesting, actually.
995500	997500	But can you imagine them being separate universes?
997500	1001500	Or Pokemon Go, to use a much bigger game that so many people have been playing.
1001500	1003500	Can you imagine if those games were not...
1003500	1007500	If you wanted to do a raid, you could only raid with other iPhone people.
1007500	1009500	Or if you're Android, you could only raid with other...
1009500	1010500	Can you imagine?
1010500	1013500	That's just one of those things. It's just not even an issue in the cell phone universe.
1013500	1017500	That's how we'll split the teams. iPhone versus Android.
1017500	1022500	But is that also because in the cell phone universe, usually those companies are the ones running the server.
1022500	1028500	Whereas in the console world, you have PlayStation Network, you have Nintendo's network, you have Xbox Live.
1028500	1033500	There is a type of infrastructure that the console manufacturers are running.
1033500	1038500	Isn't it amazing that those servers are able to run those and not charge a thing for them?
1038500	1044500	It's so weird. It's like a global server that millions of people use and it doesn't cost them...
1044500	1047500	It doesn't cost the users money.
1047500	1054500	It's so weird that that only exists on consoles and not the PC or mobile space.
1054500	1060500	I'm telling you, the big move, the big put-it-out-on-the-table move is gonna be...
1060500	1064500	And I've been saying this for years. I think Microsoft, one of these days, is gonna bend.
1064500	1067500	They're gonna drop the fee for Xbox Live for multiplayer.
1067500	1070500	And I think that's gonna be their big power move over Sony.
1070500	1075500	In fact, you know what? I'm gonna be real bold. That's my E3 prediction this year.
1075500	1079500	No, they're not. Because these companies are getting greedier every possible way.
1079500	1081500	They're not gonna drop off money.
1081500	1083500	Microsoft can afford to make a power play.
1083500	1084500	They're gonna add another service.
1084500	1087500	You know why? Because of a story that's coming up later in the show.
1087500	1088500	That's gonna be the new Xbox Live.
1088500	1092500	They're gonna add another service that they're gonna charge more money for on top of that.
1092500	1094500	I'm sorry. It's not gonna happen.
1094500	1096500	I don't think I agree. I don't think I agree.
1096500	1098500	I'm sticking with that. I think Microsoft...
1098500	1102500	If they really want to make people's heads turn and start something in this war,
1102500	1104500	Microsoft's gonna drop the fee for multiplayer.
1104500	1108500	They can still keep Xbox Live for their discounts and their free games
1108500	1111500	and all that other stuff that they do with Xbox Gold.
1111500	1113500	But I think, as far as multiplayer goes,
1113500	1116500	Microsoft would be doing something really stinking bold
1116500	1117500	if they said,
1117500	1122500	A, cross-play between Windows and Microsoft will never be an issue,
1122500	1123500	and B, it's free.
1123500	1125500	Can you imagine the fan reaction?
1125500	1128500	Multiplayer is the way it should be. Free.
1129500	1130500	It would be very positive.
1130500	1134500	It would just be another feather in their cap, I guess.
1134500	1136500	And more power to them.
1136500	1140500	Because honestly, they seem to be listening to the fans more than Sony has.
1140500	1144500	But Sony, I mean, Sony has that power position of
1144500	1148500	they've got the exclusives, they've got the library, they've got...
1148500	1152500	Yeah, but you know what? The more and more I look at some of their exclusives,
1152500	1156500	I was all gung-ho about fucking some of their games that are coming out,
1156500	1157500	and it's just like,
1157500	1160500	Ehh, they weren't that great when they came out.
1160500	1162500	Even Shadow of the Colossus and stuff,
1162500	1164500	I don't really necessarily need something like that.
1164500	1167500	I don't play the Uncharted series, I can't give a shit about that.
1167500	1171500	I think Sony just has to be cautious with that.
1171500	1174500	I mean, right now we're seeing them be a little bold.
1174500	1178500	And if they want to do some dick moves with things like Fortnite and stuff
1178500	1179500	where they're kind of in control,
1179500	1183500	that's business, sometimes it sucks for us, that's just the way it goes.
1183500	1186500	You can't go to Burger King and order a McWhopper,
1186500	1187500	or a Mc...
1187500	1188500	Here's the thing.
1188500	1190500	A Mc... whatever, Big Double.
1190500	1191500	Can you tell how often I eat fast food?
1191500	1194500	Console games and console rules are,
1194500	1196500	most games really anyway,
1196500	1200500	are kind of unregulated for business practice.
1200500	1203500	So when you have an unregulated company,
1203500	1207500	they will do whatever they can do to make that bottom line.
1207500	1208500	To make the dollar.
1208500	1211500	Or the yen or whatever, the Krugerrand.
1211500	1219500	But at the end, I mean, it is an unregulated ecosystem.
1219500	1222500	They can charge whatever they want to.
1222500	1225500	For what they charge, they've got certain regulations on it.
1225500	1228500	But they can do whatever they want to within that ecosystem.
1228500	1231500	If they want to make it cross-platform, they can do that.
1231500	1235500	If they want to charge you X amount of dollars to use their service
1236500	1239500	so that you can then play what would otherwise be a free multiplayer,
1239500	1241500	right now, there's nothing to stop them.
1241500	1245500	And consumers will keep paying them because they want to do this.
1245500	1249500	Well, but that also, if Sony gets over-confident,
1249500	1250500	that's going to do them in.
1250500	1251500	And I'm just going to point to,
1251500	1256500	if you want to see the biggest example of an industry being over...
1256500	1259500	or a company being over-confident, not listening to their fans,
1259500	1262500	and it ultimately backfired on them,
1262500	1265500	go back to Microsoft's original unveiling of the Xbox One,
1265500	1267500	where Microsoft basically said,
1267500	1271500	we're going to change the way that you play video games at home.
1271500	1275500	And the response of the user base was, the fuck you are.
1276500	1278500	And that was that. Remember, guys?
1278500	1282500	Remember how the disks were going to be only on your console?
1282500	1284500	And actually, it's funny, now all these years later
1284500	1287500	that we're hearing more about how that was really going to work,
1287500	1290500	I think you hear more people interested in that.
1290500	1293500	And as more and more people are going towards a completely digital library,
1293500	1298500	I almost feel like maybe Microsoft was just two years too early
1298500	1299500	in a lot of their ideas.
1299500	1301500	I don't know, it's really difficult to say.
1301500	1304500	But at that time, Microsoft wanted to take the wheel
1304500	1306500	and flip it in another direction,
1306500	1309500	and the consumers ultimately spoke up and said,
1309500	1310500	fuck a whole lot of you.
1310500	1313500	What do you offer?
1313500	1317500	And then Sony was able to come out at E3 and basically say,
1317500	1319500	so, we've heard what you said.
1319500	1321500	You don't want this, you don't want this.
1321500	1322500	So guess what?
1322500	1325500	Here's how you share a game with a friend.
1325500	1326500	Hand the disk over.
1326500	1329500	What? $499 is too much because you don't want to connect?
1329500	1330500	Okay, $399.
1330500	1334500	And the entire internet has a collective orgasm over Sony
1334500	1336500	that Sony can even slip in.
1336500	1338500	By the way, we're going to start charging for multiplayer.
1338500	1339500	We didn't do that before.
1339500	1342500	And nobody fucking batted an eye.
1342500	1344500	Now here's the one catch.
1345500	1349500	Had this been something for the NES or the GameCube even,
1349500	1352500	you know, I'd say in the game consoles
1352500	1355500	that were pre the advent of social media,
1355500	1359500	and it was that they were always locked that way.
1359500	1361500	No one would have had a problem with it
1361500	1363500	because that's the way it's always been done.
1363500	1365500	And people get, though, caught up.
1365500	1367500	They don't see where, you know,
1367500	1369500	yeah, maybe it was something that would have been better
1369500	1371500	for, you know, those companies,
1371500	1374500	but any time any type of change is introduced, though,
1374500	1377500	that is an obvious change like that
1377500	1379500	to the status quo that people are going to resist.
1379500	1381500	You know, we have those people at work, right?
1381500	1384500	And you've shown them how to do something a new, better way.
1384500	1386500	But the old way works.
1386500	1389500	The old way is inefficient.
1389500	1393500	Remember what I do for a living, and yes, I know this very well.
1393500	1394500	I know.
1394500	1396500	But, like, you know,
1396500	1398500	oh, we've already done it this way. It works.
1398500	1401500	Yeah, and the old way will take you ten times as long
1401500	1404500	and cut your efficiency, you know,
1404500	1406500	but people want to do it the old way.
1406500	1408500	The same thing goes a lot with gamers.
1408500	1411500	We have created an automation tool that will do the work for you,
1411500	1413500	but this works.
1413500	1416500	I don't want to use Excel. It's scary.
1416500	1418500	That's what happens.
1418500	1420500	Anyway, I want to go to a comment from chat
1420500	1422500	over at live.vognetwork.com.
1422500	1425500	Kaijuto says, Sony won't get overconfident.
1425500	1427500	They've been in the game business, the PlayStation 1.
1427500	1429500	They know what they're doing.
1429500	1432500	Kaijuto, my friend, you're forgetting something.
1432500	1434500	It's been a long time since the PS1.
1434500	1436500	I got three words for you.
1436500	1438500	Giant enemy crabs.
1438500	1440500	Sony's been there, too.
1440500	1441500	How soon they forget.
1441500	1443500	How soon we all forget.
1443500	1445500	I think we've pointed this out before, too,
1445500	1449500	is that there's been this interesting kind of ping-pong that's gone
1449500	1452500	where, you know, the last generation with the 360 and the PS3,
1452500	1455500	Microsoft really dominated that conversation
1455500	1457500	because the PlayStation 3 was simply too expensive
1457500	1459500	and it really kind of stumbled out the gate.
1459500	1461500	You know, Sony, I think, eventually caught up
1461500	1463500	when they started putting out more stuff like LittleBigPlanet
1463500	1465500	and they, you know, they made some moves to really get
1465500	1467500	where they needed to be with the PlayStation 3,
1467500	1469500	which helped them with launching the PlayStation 4.
1469500	1473500	So, I mean, to the comment's credit and to Sony's credit,
1473500	1478500	they knew they were flopping and they corrected course really fast.
1478500	1481500	And Microsoft, to be fair to them,
1481500	1483500	they've really, really worked hard to correct course
1483500	1485500	ever since that original Xbox One unveil.
1485500	1488500	You know, they flipped out the guy in charge.
1488500	1489500	That was a big move right there.
1489500	1491500	That was something Sony never really did.
1491500	1494500	But anyway, let's see.
1494500	1498500	Going to our chat over at live.vognet.com,
1498500	1501500	Azet says, oh, fuck, I'm surrounded by those people
1501500	1503500	talking about our conversation at work there.
1503500	1506500	And Kaijuto says, what, Krabs?
1506500	1508500	I have no idea what that is. Like, for real.
1508500	1510500	You may have, you may have, I don't know, maybe you,
1510500	1514500	I sometimes forget that like 2006 was like over 10 years ago.
1514500	1516500	So, and some of our listeners are in their lower 20s.
1516500	1518500	So they may actually forget this stuff.
1518500	1521500	But yeah, when Microsoft or when Sony originally-
1521500	1525500	Just go watch the 2006 E3 press conference.
1525500	1528500	Nutshell. Game about feudal Japan with giant enemy Krabs.
1528500	1532500	Yeah. And they went in this whole spiel about the historical accuracy
1532500	1534500	and all of a sudden they're fighting a giant enemy Krab.
1534500	1537500	It was just, and it wasn't, it wasn't just that,
1537500	1543500	but like it, that kind of just put a whole thing on like how out of touch the message was.
1543500	1546500	And you know what? Nintendo has had floppy threes too.
1546500	1551500	So no company is immune from, you know, trying to-
1551500	1555500	How about the Wii Vitality sensor? Anybody? Anybody?
1555500	1557500	Vapor. Anybody? Yeah.
1557500	1559500	Vapor. What about Wii Music?
1559500	1561500	Yeah. Anybody? So, I mean-
1561500	1563500	Oh, Wii Music I would have been happy for though.
1563500	1565500	Well, Wii Music happened.
1565500	1567500	No, but I meant like-
1567500	1569500	I was going to say the fact that you may have not been aware.
1569500	1571500	No. It actually did come out.
1571500	1575500	No, I mean like the way that we thought it was gonna, you know?
1575500	1577500	Yeah. No, I got you. I got you.
1577500	1579500	Cause Bobby does back you up in chat there.
1579500	1581500	Wii Music came out and it sucked.
1581500	1583500	Yeah. So there it is. Anyway.
1583500	1586500	All right. I want to talk about one other thing before we get into our gaming weeks.
1586500	1589500	It's not officially on the show roll, but I know people are talking about this.
1589500	1593500	I saw a chat comment earlier talking about the new Tomb Raider movie.
1593500	1595500	And I know the reviews are kind of-
1595500	1597500	Well, I didn't see it. Loki didn't see it.
1597500	1599500	But- I saw it last night.
1599500	1603500	You saw it. So tell it. Give us in a nutshell your hot take on Tomb Raider the new movie.
1603500	1606500	I think that the beginning had a little bit too much exposition.
1606500	1609500	You know, with Lara's reasoning or whatever.
1609500	1612500	The actress that played Lara was really good. I liked her a lot.
1612500	1615500	She's an Oscar winning actress if I remember right.
1615500	1617500	I guess.
1617500	1619500	I think she is. She won for-
1619500	1621500	The Danish Girl? Was it called?
1621500	1623500	I don't remember. But anyway, it was a couple years ago.
1623500	1625500	You know, she-
1625500	1631500	She totally caught the essence of Lara Croft and the horrible, terrible, no good, very bad day.
1631500	1635500	You know, that was the Tomb Raider game that this was based off of.
1635500	1637500	Um, there were certain-
1637500	1639500	The action was pretty fun.
1639500	1643500	There were certain scenes in it that I thought were, yeah, this belongs in a game and not in a movie.
1643500	1645500	You know, like puzzle solving shit.
1645500	1647500	I'm almost positive they probably-
1647500	1649500	I haven't seen it, but in seeing some of the stills,
1649500	1653500	it looks like they ripped a waterfall sequence like right out of the game.
1653500	1655500	If I'm not mistaken.
1655500	1657500	With the giant plane?
1657500	1659500	Yes, there was a plane. Yep, in the game there was like a plane.
1659500	1661500	Yeah, so they probably ripped that.
1661500	1663500	It was pretty- I don't think it was exactly the same, but-
1663500	1665500	Well, sure.
1665500	1667500	Yeah.
1667500	1669500	But at least they tried to make that, I guess, as plausible as possible.
1669500	1671500	But yeah, there was the boat scene.
1671500	1673500	I mean, they pulled a bunch out of it.
1673500	1679500	And the other thing that for me, given just that I've tried to study as much, you know-
1679500	1681500	I love studying cultural mythology.
1681500	1683500	And the fact that they took a-
1683500	1693500	Someone who was supposedly a real empress in ancient Japan and made some bullshit story about her.
1693500	1695500	That actually there was no myth at all.
1695500	1697500	They just made it up.
1697500	1699500	Like that.
1699500	1701500	And that was the part that I couldn't suspend my disbelief over.
1701500	1705500	So you were more like, they should have just made up a fake empress or something?
1705500	1707500	The intellectual has no place in this movie.
1707500	1709500	They could have just used the childlike empress.
1709500	1711500	How do you feel about Pocahontas by Disney?
1711500	1713500	You know, I've never seen Pocahontas.
1713500	1715500	Really?
1715500	1717500	And I don't want to see it because, again-
1717500	1719500	Because of this reason.
1719500	1721500	She never married fucking John Smith.
1721500	1725500	She married some other white guy who took her to Europe and she died of pneumonia.
1725500	1727500	Hold up, hold up.
1727500	1729500	Disney's gonna make Pocahontas live action too?
1729500	1730500	Yes.
1730500	1732500	Is nothing sacred anymore?
1732500	1734500	Is Disney doing every single fucking 90s movie?
1734500	1736500	They've run out of ideas.
1736500	1738500	Jesus Christ.
1738500	1740500	Little Mermaid, are they doing that too?
1740500	1742500	No, but they have The Lion King and then they have Pocahontas.
1742500	1744500	I know they're doing The Lion King, but here's the thing.
1744500	1746500	Lion King has Beyonce.
1746500	1750500	So like, how can it be bad?
1750500	1752500	How can it be bad? Beyonce.
1752500	1754500	Is she playing Nala?
1754500	1756500	Oh yeah.
1756500	1758500	Cool, I'm down with that.
1758500	1772500	In the end, it's not a movie for people who fucking know history or have any kind of experience in anthropology or know how on-site digs work either.
1772500	1776500	There's just way too much that I really could not suspend my disbelief over.
1776500	1782500	There was a really cool shot right at the end. There's nothing after the credits. That's not a spoiler.
1782500	1786500	That's not a spoiler to say. Don't bother staying through the credits.
1786500	1794500	You have a credit start, then it shows you the scene, and then Nick Frost is in it though.
1794500	1796500	Oh, okay.
1796500	1804500	You know who Nick Frost is. For those who don't, in Shaun of the Dead, he was the lazy friend.
1804500	1806500	Yeah, the friend.
1806500	1808500	The gorilla. The monkey.
1808500	1814500	But anyway, the treat for me for that movie was seeing Nick Frost.
1814500	1816500	I mean, seriously, because he's funny and I adore him.
1816500	1822500	So at the end of the day, how many big boobies out of five since it is Tomb Raider after all?
1822500	1824500	Well, they weren't pointy.
1824500	1832500	Did you know, by the way, that some people are critical? This is just the internet. I don't know. Maybe I misread that it was the article from The Onion.
1832500	1840500	So take this from A Great Assault. But there are some people critical that the actress did not have big enough breasts to play Lara Croft.
1840500	1854500	And Dungeon Busters said it was a neat twist to the myth that they were pursuing, but while I like that angle to it, I still hated that they created a bullshit story to base the movie off of.
1854500	1856500	The whole story was bullshit.
1856500	1858500	So how many unrealistically big boobies out of five?
1858500	1860500	I'd give it a two.
1860500	1862500	Two boobies? Oh, perfect!
1862500	1866500	A nice, perfectly formed pair of adequate boobs.
1866500	1868500	Okay.
1868500	1870500	Thank you, Dart. Thank you for playing along on my silly joke.
1870500	1872500	You're welcome.
1872500	1876500	That's okay, because Lara Croft is also in Ready Player One.
1876500	1880500	You are not shutting up about that movie. Actually, when does that come out? That's like two weeks?
1880500	1882500	Next week.
1882500	1884500	It's a week from Thursday.
1884500	1890500	Okay, so by the next OLR, we'll get to have your take on Ready Player One. Hopefully we've all seen it.
1890500	1894500	Yes, I will have definitely seen it at least once.
1894500	1898500	At least once, hopefully. And I hear that one's getting good reviews.
1898500	1900500	Yes.
1900500	1902500	That's rare.
1902500	1904500	What if you see it and it's terra-bad?
1904500	1906500	It's not. There's no way that it can be terra-bad.
1906500	1908500	We'll see. Famous last words.
1908500	1910500	To quote the Princess Bride, life is pain, Highness.
1910500	1914500	They can just play that trailer, all the trailers, for just the whole two and a half hours.
1914500	1918500	Anyone who tells you differently is selling something.
1918500	1924500	Alright. Yeah, Tigerclaw points out it's got an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes.
1924500	1928500	There's a lot of movies that get good ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and they're hot garbage.
1928500	1930500	It's Spielberg.
1930500	1936500	There's some Spielberg movies I don't like. It's a decent litmus test though, I will say that.
1936500	1942500	For example, Lady Bird got like 99% and I love Lady Bird. You all know I love that movie.
1942500	1945500	So there's a lot of movies on there that get really good reviews that I do like.
1945500	1951500	But sometimes there's a bad movie that it's like, okay, but I like that movie because it was kind of bad.
1951500	1953500	I like the books. Well, I like Xanadu.
1953500	1956500	Like Adam Sandler movies from the early 90s, not the new stuff.
1956500	1960500	But like, you know, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, critics hated those fucking movies.
1960500	1963500	But like, they were funny. Exactly.
1963500	1965500	I didn't think they were funny. I don't know.
1965500	1967500	When I was a 12 year old boy, they were funny.
1967500	1969500	But then again, I mean, like I said, I like Xanadu.
1969500	1974500	Okay, yeah. And that movie is generally reviewed as terrible.
1974500	1977500	But it now has a Broadway show. So who's the winner now?
1977500	1980500	You know who else has a Broadway show? SpongeBob SquarePants.
1980500	1984500	I keep seeing ads on Facebook.
1984500	1987500	All right. Anyway.
1987500	1991500	So let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks.
1991500	1994500	So what types of video games have you been playing this week?
1994500	1995500	Dark Sakura.
1995500	2000500	We've been going back to Breath of the Wild because we're playing it again on Switch.
2000500	2002500	I actually didn't play any WoW this week.
2002500	2004500	But we're just Pokemon Go a little bit.
2004500	2006500	Actually, no, I wasn't even playing Pokemon Go.
2006500	2009500	Because I like to start my week on Sunday and I missed a day.
2009500	2012500	So I started my week over today.
2012500	2015500	I'm still playing Ragnarok, the idol pouring.
2015500	2017500	And I'm still playing Animal Crossing.
2017500	2020500	Which they've now brought in more animals.
2020500	2023500	And they had a fishing tourney going on.
2023500	2025500	So that's pretty fun.
2025500	2028500	Other than that, I've just been, because I've been so sick this week.
2028500	2032500	And we also finished watching Jessica Jones, which was amazing.
2032500	2034500	Oh, that's right. Season 2 just came out, right?
2034500	2038500	Yeah. And finally finished it after people spoiled it for me.
2038500	2042500	The same day that Drag Race was spoiled for me, too.
2042500	2046500	So I had two in the same day. Ugh, people. Killing me.
2046500	2048500	Right? I'm dead.
2048500	2050500	All right. Loki, how was your gaming week?
2050500	2053500	I didn't play a whole ton this week, but I did play some new stuff.
2053500	2056500	So I did end up getting Burnout Paradise Remastered.
2056500	2058500	So I played that for a bit.
2058500	2062500	It was kind of fun because I hadn't actually played a lot of the DLC stuff.
2062500	2067500	So I tried out some of the cars in there, and I went to the Paradise Island thing.
2067500	2070500	Just quickly, I also picked that up. I haven't played it yet.
2070500	2074500	I am going to play it for the first time as tonight's OLR post-show.
2074500	2076500	It was pretty good.
2076500	2079500	Or I should say the second time, because I did play it on 360, you know, years ago.
2079500	2081500	I don't remember. I played it a while ago.
2081500	2083500	And I'm still, like, the only thing I don't like about the game,
2083500	2086500	is actually just a minor gripe, is the controls.
2086500	2089500	Like, I don't remember how to do the...
2089500	2091500	Where you crash and you go into that whole Crash Breaker mode,
2091500	2094500	where you're, like, just causing a bunch of destruction.
2094500	2097500	And I couldn't remember what the commands were for that.
2097500	2099500	And there's no manual for the game.
2099500	2103500	And there's no customize your button layout for the game.
2103500	2105500	I'm like, what the fuck are the...
2105500	2108500	Am I going to have to go on the internet to figure out what the hell do I have to push for this shit?
2108500	2111500	And, like, as I push all the buttons, I'm like, oh, well, this thing's been working.
2111500	2113500	I'm like, it's been so long since I played this.
2113500	2115500	But, so, I've...
2115500	2117500	That's the only thing, my minor gripe for that.
2117500	2119500	But, and then, like...
2119500	2121500	Even this was a problem with the original game.
2121500	2123500	Like, the contrast in the colors.
2123500	2125500	It's all, like, kind of washed out looking.
2125500	2129500	And it's also really hard to see stuff, because it's so washed out.
2129500	2133500	And I just wish it was more vibrantly colored.
2133500	2135500	But I get that. I mean, I get that.
2135500	2137500	That was the style of the game. That's the way it looked. Whatever.
2137500	2139500	It's fine. But yeah, it's a great game.
2139500	2141500	I love it. So, probably definitely play more of it.
2141500	2143500	I'm excited to check it out.
2143500	2145500	Yeah. It's great having all the cars and stuff.
2145500	2147500	I was like, well, I'm not going to stick with this shitty starter car.
2147500	2149500	I'm going to pick one of these better cars.
2149500	2151500	And they're like, wait, this is way too fast.
2151500	2153500	I can't drive this car. It's too fast.
2155500	2157500	I guess play with the ones that have, like, alternate boost styles.
2157500	2159500	Like, there's one...
2159500	2161500	You push the boost down, it doesn't turn off.
2161500	2163500	Ever.
2163500	2165500	It just keeps going.
2165500	2167500	And so I was trying that.
2167500	2169500	And then I just immediately explode.
2169500	2171500	Aside from that, you know, the usual stuff.
2171500	2173500	Cell phone games.
2173500	2175500	Pokemon. Ingress.
2175500	2177500	Occasionally when I'm going to play starters.
2177500	2179500	Stuff to play that.
2179500	2181500	And...
2181500	2183500	You know, that's pretty much it.
2183500	2185500	Cool.
2185500	2187500	Just a quick update for our live listeners.
2187500	2189500	If you happen to be listening live, but not in the chat,
2189500	2191500	where you can see that Bobby Blackwell
2191500	2193500	has been consulting with our service provider
2193500	2195500	as the dropouts have been occurring.
2195500	2197500	And Bobby does have an update that apparently
2197500	2199500	there is planned maintenance at the data center
2199500	2201500	that runs the Shoutcast stream.
2201500	2203500	And there is intermittent downtime for the next hour
2203500	2205500	because of that. Funny, planned maintenance.
2205500	2207500	I don't recall getting an email on that, Bobby.
2207500	2209500	Did you get an email on that, Bobby?
2209500	2211500	Because I don't recall getting an email on that.
2211500	2213500	Anyway, that is what's going on.
2213500	2215500	So, unfortunately, apparently they thought
2215500	2217500	Sunday night, which... Isn't Sunday night
2217500	2219500	like prime time television?
2219500	2221500	Aren't all the big award shows on, like, Sunday night?
2221500	2223500	So Sunday night is like prime time.
2223500	2225500	Am I correct?
2225500	2227500	So there was planned maintenance planned on Sunday night.
2227500	2229500	Like at midnight or something.
2229500	2231500	This is like...
2231500	2233500	It's not that late.
2233500	2235500	So, anyway, as I said earlier, stay tuned
2235500	2237500	because VOG Network is going to be moving later this year.
2237500	2239500	Anyway.
2239500	2241500	My gaming week.
2241500	2243500	So some of the video games I've been playing this week.
2243500	2245500	So I've also been doing cell phone gaming.
2245500	2247500	Ingress and Pokemon Go I played a lot yesterday
2247500	2249500	because Ingress has been having this event called
2249500	2251500	Dark XM, where in a nutshell
2251500	2253500	you were really encouraged to go
2253500	2255500	flip portals that maybe really weren't
2255500	2257500	normally your team's portals.
2257500	2259500	So my buddy, Isette, who's listening out there
2259500	2261500	and I, we went out to
2261500	2263500	some areas that just, like, the portals never
2263500	2265500	like, they're so remote. We went to, like, remote areas.
2265500	2267500	Roseville.
2267500	2269500	No, not that. Because they fight for it there.
2269500	2271500	We went out to, like, Ione and Sutter Creek
2271500	2273500	and these areas where people don't really play.
2273500	2275500	And so we, uh, yeah, we
2275500	2277500	did some portal catching
2277500	2279500	in those areas. And then the whole time
2279500	2281500	I was running my Pokemon Go thing as well
2281500	2283500	and I caught a lot of Pokemon.
2283500	2285500	So, actually, one of the places we ended up at
2285500	2287500	we went to Jackson Rancheria because
2287500	2289500	you know, we met for coffee early on in the day
2289500	2291500	and then, you know, I gotta use the
2291500	2293500	restroom, so we thought, oh, the casino's a good place to do it
2293500	2295500	because we're right there. So we went to the casino
2295500	2297500	and, uh, you know, I went to go do my
2297500	2299500	business and Isette pretty quickly
2299500	2301500	lost $20 on the slot machine and I was
2301500	2303500	like, eh, you know, I'll put $20
2303500	2305500	in the slot machine. Why not? I'm gonna gamble a little bit.
2305500	2307500	I actually found a Pac-Man slot machine.
2307500	2309500	I did not know that there was a new,
2309500	2311500	and I know it's new because it uses a lot of the sound effects
2311500	2313500	from Championship Edition and all that, so
2313500	2315500	I actually found a Pac-Man slot machine
2315500	2317500	and I played that. And, like, for the longest time
2317500	2319500	it's one of those penny slots
2319500	2321500	but they're not really penny slots because
2321500	2323500	the minimum bet is, like, 60 cents.
2323500	2325500	Well, I kept playing and playing and it's like
2325500	2327500	you lose 60 cents, you lose 60
2327500	2329500	cents, you gained $1.20 and it's like
2329500	2331500	I wasn't moving, like, whatsoever.
2331500	2333500	And I was like, alright, whatever. And then I'm like
2333500	2335500	okay, it's gotta be bored and
2335500	2337500	you know, we want to get back on the road, we want to stay here all day.
2337500	2339500	So I was just like, you know what, fuck it, I'm gonna do
2339500	2341500	max bet. So I went boop and I bet
2341500	2343500	like three bucks max bet, spin the wheel,
2343500	2345500	ding ding ding, you win eight times
2345500	2347500	your bet. So I was like, sweet,
2347500	2349500	I'm up $14. Cash out,
2349500	2351500	we're done, let's go.
2351500	2353500	So for once in my life
2353500	2355500	I knew when to quit, so I quit.
2355500	2357500	Thank you Pac-Man for the $14, I appreciate
2357500	2359500	that. So
2359500	2361500	that was Saturday.
2361500	2363500	I will talk about a newer game I've been playing
2363500	2365500	because I'm still playing the old favorites.
2365500	2367500	Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm, POM SE 14.
2367500	2369500	Let's talk about a new game I've actually been playing
2369500	2371500	quite a bit of this week.
2371500	2373500	It's a game that just came out on PlayStation 4
2373500	2375500	here in the US, although I did
2375500	2377500	kind of play this once before because the
2377500	2379500	game had came out, I think in like Thailand
2379500	2381500	a few months ago, and Shane made me
2381500	2383500	play it a few months ago, but now I've really spent
2383500	2385500	some time with DJ Max Respect.
2385500	2387500	So I've been playing that on PlayStation 4.
2387500	2389500	It is right now
2389500	2391500	download only, I think it's gonna set you back
2391500	2393500	$49.99 as well.
2393500	2395500	It's a music game, it's very very
2395500	2397500	very very similar to Beatmania.
2397500	2399500	In fact it's one of those things where
2399500	2401500	I always sometimes wonder how
2401500	2403500	Konami doesn't sue them because it's the whole
2403500	2405500	falling notes on the line and I
2405500	2407500	thought Konami had the patent for that, but whatever.
2407500	2409500	I'm not gonna complain because if Konami
2409500	2411500	isn't gonna do shit with Beatmania, which they
2411500	2413500	they are in the arcades,
2413500	2415500	but when was the last time they put out a
2415500	2417500	console Beatmania game?
2417500	2419500	PlayStation 2 is how long
2419500	2421500	ago, anyway, you do the math.
2421500	2423500	So, I'm really happy to
2423500	2425500	have a game like that that I can play on
2425500	2427500	the PlayStation 4, and
2427500	2429500	unfortunately there's no special controller, you just have to
2429500	2431500	use the, well, I hear there's a third
2431500	2433500	party special controller, but I'm
2433500	2435500	not getting into any of that. So
2435500	2437500	you use your regular controller and you can
2437500	2439500	play in four button mode,
2439500	2441500	five button, six button, or eight button.
2441500	2443500	So in four button mode you're using
2443500	2445500	left and up, and
2445500	2447500	triangle and circle are the four buttons.
2447500	2449500	So you can play like that. If you add
2449500	2451500	five buttons then it's square
2451500	2453500	or right, six buttons is
2453500	2455500	square and right, and then
2455500	2457500	eight button adds L1 and R1 and it's
2457500	2459500	really hard. I did a little
2459500	2461500	bit of a stream with this where I had a lot of technical
2461500	2463500	difficulties, so thank you guys who stuck with me, so
2463500	2465500	I finally figured out how to broadcast
2465500	2467500	with no audio lag on the PlayStation 4,
2467500	2469500	that took me a little bit. But anyway,
2469500	2471500	I've
2471500	2473500	actually been playing more since that stream,
2473500	2475500	and those of you guys that were probably watching the stream
2475500	2477500	saw me flop hard on the first
2477500	2479500	song I played, I was really overwhelmed.
2479500	2481500	I've actually, I've noticed
2481500	2483500	myself making some improvements in the game,
2483500	2485500	and I've just been kind of playing all over the map, like I play
2485500	2487500	some four button, I play some six
2487500	2489500	buttons, some five button. The game really
2489500	2491500	rewards
2491500	2493500	a variety of different types of play styles
2493500	2495500	with the various unlocks. It's like
2495500	2497500	you have to play so many four button songs to
2497500	2499500	unlock this list, and you have to do so much of
2499500	2501500	this to unlock this list. So yeah,
2501500	2503500	I kind of like how the game has that all set up.
2503500	2505500	I would say the one
2505500	2507500	drawback, and some people are really gonna
2507500	2509500	disagree with me here, but this is my
2509500	2511500	opinion!
2511500	2513500	I don't think the music in DJ Max
2513500	2515500	is as strong as it is in Beatmania 2DX.
2515500	2517500	I just, but that's because
2517500	2519500	I prefer like the trance
2519500	2521500	type of stuff that
2521500	2523500	you know, the Japanese techno and all that
2523500	2525500	stuff that Beatmania is really heavy on.
2525500	2527500	I don't really see that same type
2527500	2529500	of stuff present in
2529500	2531500	DJ Max. There's some
2531500	2533500	of it though. I mean there are, to be fair,
2533500	2535500	there are a wide variety of songs
2535500	2537500	but there are a lot of songs in there
2537500	2539500	that I kind of find to be forgettable.
2539500	2541500	But there are some songs that are
2541500	2543500	really really good, and one thing I do like
2543500	2545500	about it is that, you know, it's
2545500	2547500	the respect is kind of
2547500	2549500	a weird setup because like when you look at the
2549500	2551500	title screen of the game, it's like
2551500	2553500	you see all these tombstones with like
2553500	2555500	portable one, portable two, and like
2555500	2557500	all the old DJ Max games that have
2557500	2559500	come out, and then it's like push X to
2559500	2561500	pay respect. And that's why it's
2561500	2563500	called DJ Max Respect. So it's all
2563500	2565500	the songs from the old games
2565500	2567500	are in this newer game. And there's
2567500	2569500	gonna be DLC coming out, like they're gonna do
2569500	2571500	Classic Y as DLC because that's already
2571500	2573500	out overseas, and I guess they're saying
2573500	2575500	it's supposed to be here within a month, and
2575500	2577500	that's gonna be awesome because I really do like the Classic Y
2577500	2579500	songs. Like if you've never heard Flee, that's
2579500	2581500	like the best song in all of DJ Max.
2581500	2583500	So I'm really excited to have that playable
2583500	2585500	and so, yeah, there are, you know, I know
2585500	2587500	some of the DLC songs will be strong and so
2587500	2589500	forth, but, you know,
2589500	2591500	there's not a lot of like commercial
2591500	2593500	or licensed stuff. All of it
2593500	2595500	is like in-house developed. But you may
2595500	2597500	see some familiar names, like
2597500	2599500	Sampling Masters, who I think had
2599500	2601500	a couple songs, 2DX, they have a couple songs in
2601500	2603500	DJ Max. So, you know,
2603500	2605500	it's not a completely unfamiliar list.
2605500	2607500	So, anyway.
2607500	2609500	Um,
2609500	2611500	I think that's all
2611500	2613500	I have to say on DJ Max. Oh no, is there anything else I should
2613500	2615500	say about the game? There is an online mode
2615500	2617500	that I've barely played it because when I go into online
2617500	2619500	mode, I only see like one
2619500	2621500	room ever open with an extremely high
2621500	2623500	level player and I'm like, I know how that's gonna
2623500	2625500	go. So I don't know if the online
2625500	2627500	does matching very well, so
2627500	2629500	I would get put with somebody that's at my own level.
2629500	2631500	Um, but, it does have
2631500	2633500	online, so like if you want to play with your friends and
2633500	2635500	stuff, you could compete
2635500	2637500	on certain songs or things of that sort.
2637500	2639500	So. Oh, one thing I did
2639500	2641500	want to mention, um, but just
2641500	2643500	very briefly, because it is very brief,
2643500	2645500	I have started working on a game again.
2645500	2647500	On making
2647500	2649500	something. And it is something new.
2649500	2651500	Anything else you want to
2651500	2653500	say about it? Nope, that's it.
2653500	2655500	What engine are you using? Unity? Yeah.
2655500	2657500	I have an upgrade too.
2657500	2659500	I think
2659500	2661500	they have like Unity 2007. Alright.
2661500	2663500	Why give Bobby Blackwell full
2663500	2665500	permission and nag you every week until
2665500	2667500	it's done? It's fine. Alright.
2667500	2669500	Good. You hear that Bobby? Alright.
2669500	2671500	Anyway, I think that's it for
2671500	2673500	my gaming week. So, uh, housekeeping.
2673500	2675500	As I said earlier, sadly, we're not going to be here
2675500	2677500	live for the next two weeks, which I know really sucks
2677500	2679500	because we're having these live service provider
2679500	2681500	issues, but that is the
2681500	2683500	joy and risk of live radio
2683500	2685500	is that sometimes things don't always go according to plan.
2685500	2687500	But, um, yeah. So we won't be here
2687500	2689500	live for two weeks. We will be back on April 8th.
2689500	2691500	As far as the podcast feed goes,
2691500	2693500	you will get tonight's show uninterrupted
2693500	2695500	on the podcast feed because we're still
2695500	2697500	we're still doing this show as if it's
2697500	2699500	gonna go to the feed. Uh, so that'll be
2699500	2701500	there. And then the April 8th, uh, show
2701500	2703500	will be on the podcast feed, of course. And then we're
2703500	2705500	gonna do a bonus show somewhere during the time
2705500	2707500	off. A little closer to April 1st.
2707500	2709500	We'll do a bonus show since we won't be
2709500	2711500	here that weekend. So, um,
2711500	2713500	that is the upcoming schedule.
2713500	2715500	Otherwise, follow us on Twitter at
2715500	2717500	OLR. We're also on Facebook, Orange
2717500	2719500	Lounge Radio, all one word. Let's
2719500	2721500	get into some gaming news.
2721500	2723500	Loki. Alright. Sounds good.
2723500	2725500	So, um, let's
2725500	2727500	talk a little bit about, once again,
2727500	2729500	um,
2729500	2731500	free games.
2731500	2733500	Because free games are awesome. And so
2733500	2735500	this is kinda cool. So, you remember
2735500	2737500	with the whole, uh, Twitch Prime
2737500	2739500	stuff, you kinda get, you know, your free
2739500	2741500	subscription that you can do each month
2741500	2743500	and stuff like that. Well, now, starting
2743500	2745500	soon, they're actually gonna allow
2745500	2747500	you to get free games as
2747500	2749500	well. So, starting March 15th
2749500	2751500	through the 31st, you're gonna get access
2751500	2753500	to the following titles. So,
2753500	2755500	Oxenfree, Mr. Shifty,
2755500	2757500	Superhot, Shadow Tactics,
2757500	2759500	and Candlekeep, the Tomb of Annihilation.
2759500	2761500	And then, April,
2761500	2763500	you're gonna have access to Tales of
2763500	2765500	the Borderlands, or Tales from the Borderlands,
2765500	2767500	Steamworld Dig 2, Kingsway,
2767500	2769500	Tokyo 42, and Dubwars.
2769500	2771500	So, it's kinda
2771500	2773500	cool that they're gonna be offering, you know,
2773500	2775500	games for free through the service
2775500	2777500	as well. So, I guess
2777500	2779500	another incentive for you to get Prime.
2779500	2781500	That's, you know, what Amazon wants, I guess.
2781500	2783500	So, neat.
2784500	2786500	I don't know, these, like, Steam
2786500	2788500	titles, are they just, like,
2788500	2790500	DRM-free stuff?
2790500	2792500	I don't really know how that works.
2792500	2794500	I haven't downloaded any of them yet, but if
2794500	2796500	the previous rewards are any indication,
2796500	2798500	they often tend to go multiplatform.
2798500	2800500	So, in other words, like,
2800500	2802500	they did a Fortnite reward recently,
2802500	2804500	and you could pick. Do you want it on PC or
2804500	2806500	PlayStation 4? When they did the
2806500	2808500	Overwatch rewards,
2808500	2810500	you actually got it on everything.
2810500	2812500	Because it was, like, loot boxes. You got 10 loot boxes.
2812500	2814500	Or maybe it was 5 and 5, I don't remember.
2814500	2816500	But it's, like, when I bring it up on PC,
2816500	2818500	all my loot boxes are there, and then when I go on to the
2818500	2820500	PlayStation, I have different loot boxes,
2820500	2822500	but I also get the same amount of bonus
2822500	2824500	loot boxes there. So, that's kinda how Twitch
2824500	2826500	has handled it previously. So, I think
2826500	2828500	these releases are all PC,
2828500	2830500	but I wouldn't say that Twitch is necessarily,
2830500	2832500	or Amazon is really who it is.
2832500	2834500	They're not gonna necessarily limit themselves to that.
2834500	2836500	Hmm. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah.
2836500	2838500	For sure. And I think that's interesting
2838500	2840500	that that is Twitch kinda competing
2840500	2842500	in some ways with Xbox Live,
2842500	2844500	I guess. Yeah. Because,
2844500	2846500	or at PlayStation Plus
2846500	2848500	and the free games there. It's very interesting that
2848500	2850500	Amazon now also has this,
2850500	2852500	you know, if you're paying your yearly fee
2852500	2854500	for this, we're gonna give you some free games. Or even, like,
2854500	2856500	a Humble Monthly or something like that.
2856500	2858500	I guess. Yeah.
2858500	2860500	It's neat. There's, like,
2860500	2862500	at least, because
2862500	2864500	Prime is kind of expensive for
2864500	2866500	a year's subscription. It's starting to climb up, too.
2866500	2868500	Yeah, but at least they're giving you
2868500	2870500	a little bit more for that. So, that's
2870500	2872500	kinda nice to get more for the money that you're
2872500	2874500	paying. Yeah, for sure. Of course, they're gonna raise the
2874500	2876500	price again, I'm sure, now that they're adding all
2876500	2878500	this stuff to it. They
2878500	2880500	probably will. But, you know, if you
2880500	2882500	I don't know. I still kinda find the Twitch Prime
2882500	2884500	thing to be a really good, or the Amazon
2884500	2886500	Prime thing to be a good value with the, with
2886500	2888500	everything that I buy online with the shipping
2888500	2890500	and, you know, just the Twitch
2890500	2892500	Prime included is a pretty big deal.
2892500	2894500	And, you know, as somebody who streams on
2894500	2896500	Twitch and does make
2896500	2898500	some pocket change on Twitch, nothing that's gonna
2898500	2900500	change my finances drastically, but makes
2900500	2902500	pocket change on Twitch, please don't forget
2902500	2904500	to use your free sub on somebody.
2904500	2906500	I mean, of course, I'd love it if you used it on me, but
2906500	2908500	tons of people here at the VoiceGeeks
2908500	2910500	Network and our extended, you know, family
2910500	2912500	and friends are streaming now, so
2912500	2914500	please don't forget to use your free sub somewhere
2914500	2916500	because that's, you know, that's
2916500	2918500	a couple bucks that you can give out of your
2918500	2920500	and then that adds up. So, it's almost like you
2920500	2922500	can, that money you can kinda give to
2922500	2924500	somebody else. Yeah. So, kinda nice.
2924500	2926500	So, cool.
2926500	2928500	Well, we'll see what Twitch Prime
2928500	2930500	kinda adds to sweeten the pot later on.
2930500	2932500	Yeah, I'll be very curious to see if maybe they start
2932500	2934500	to get into console stuff as well.
2934500	2936500	Maybe Nintendo stuff someday.
2936500	2938500	I don't know. I guess nothing
2938500	2940500	is unreasonable, but
2940500	2942500	talking about Nintendo, Nintendo did recently
2942500	2944500	update the Switch firmware.
2944500	2946500	The Switch is now running on version
2946500	2948500	5.0 firmware.
2948500	2950500	So, some of the functionality that is now available
2950500	2952500	on the Switch is that you can find your
2952500	2954500	Facebook and Twitter friends on
2954500	2956500	the Switch. This is something that I would have thought
2956500	2958500	would have been their day one, but
2958500	2960500	no, you can only historically find through
2960500	2962500	your 3DS friends. But they've just now figured out that
2962500	2964500	Facebook and Twitter are things.
2964500	2966500	So, it's okay. No, because you can
2966500	2968500	post your screenshots to Facebook and Twitter the whole time.
2968500	2970500	But anyway, your friends will now
2970500	2972500	come in, so that's something a little bit new.
2972500	2974500	There's also some new icons
2974500	2976500	if you're a fan of ARMS or Kirby
2976500	2978500	Act F. You can now get some
2978500	2980500	icons for your account from
2980500	2982500	those games, ARMS and Kirby.
2982500	2984500	Stop trying to make ARMS a thing.
2984500	2986500	Also, you can filter
2986500	2988500	news. And then they did a lot with
2988500	2990500	parental controls, where like your captured
2990500	2992500	videos will only show
2992500	2994500	if the person logged in meets the parental controls.
2994500	2996500	And there's a lot with the app
2996500	2998500	as well. I don't think many people that
2998500	3000500	listen to this show use the parental controls.
3000500	3002500	However, if that is something of interest to you, I would
3002500	3004500	encourage you to check that out
3004500	3006500	on Nintendo's website about what they've changed
3006500	3008500	with parental controls, because they've added a lot more.
3008500	3010500	And we do encourage all of our
3010500	3012500	moms and dads and everybody
3012500	3014500	else out there who do raise kids
3014500	3016500	to be diligent with using these.
3016500	3018500	And watch what your kids play.
3018500	3020500	What you believe is best for your family.
3020500	3022500	Also, which I think is kind of interesting,
3022500	3024500	Nintendo Switch Pro Controller
3024500	3026500	grip colors will now display
3026500	3028500	in the controller's menu. So does that mean
3028500	3030500	you now see the actual colors of the
3030500	3032500	controller you're using?
3032500	3034500	That's kind of neat. Of the grip colors for
3034500	3036500	the Pro Controller? Well yeah, because the Pro Controller
3036500	3038500	I have a Splatoon Pro Controller
3038500	3040500	so it's pink and green.
3040500	3042500	I guess. That's kind of cool that it does that
3042500	3044500	just so they know which
3044500	3046500	controllers are which. It's just an additional
3046500	3048500	little enhancement that's kind of cool.
3048500	3050500	I like that. You know what would be a nice additional
3050500	3052500	little enhancement that they can add?
3052500	3054500	It would be pretty cool is Virtual Console.
3056500	3058500	Hopefully at E3 or else I have
3058500	3060500	no idea what they're going to do.
3060500	3062500	Anyway, also
3062500	3064500	something else that apparently is happening is that
3064500	3066500	third party docs seem to be bricking
3066500	3068500	with this new update.
3068500	3070500	So if you are using a third party doc
3070500	3072500	you're going to want to be very careful
3072500	3074500	because apparently some consoles are being
3074500	3076500	strongly impacted by this.
3076500	3078500	I know one of the makers... For absolutely
3078500	3080500	no reason whatsoever. I really hope
3080500	3082500	Nintendo didn't do it to be a dick. Oh, of course
3082500	3084500	they did. I just put, but like to
3084500	3086500	brick a console
3086500	3088500	if you want to brick anything
3088500	3090500	brick the dock. But brick the console
3090500	3092500	that's pretty fucked up.
3092500	3094500	I don't know. I mean
3094500	3096500	I guess you do take a
3096500	3098500	risk when you use third party stuff, but
3098500	3100500	most of your Best Buys
3100500	3102500	and your Game Stops sell
3102500	3104500	this stuff side by side with the Switch
3104500	3106500	and the average consumer doesn't sit there
3106500	3108500	to think, oh, this is a third party
3108500	3110500	product so I might want to be careful when using this.
3110500	3112500	Come on. Dark Soccer
3112500	3114500	has been covering peripherals of the month
3114500	3116500	over this year and they've all been
3116500	3118500	third party stuff so far.
3118500	3120500	Sometimes third parties
3120500	3122500	develop different things. So
3122500	3124500	it would be kind of a dick
3124500	3126500	move if they were doing that on purpose.
3126500	3128500	That's all.
3128500	3130500	Anyway, also apparently
3130500	3132500	with this firmware
3132500	3134500	that actually launched on the Switch
3134500	3136500	some folks data mined the firmware
3136500	3138500	and found that there is a new check
3138500	3140500	for a SOC
3140500	3142500	system on a chip.
3142500	3144500	Some thoughts out there are theorizing
3144500	3146500	this is probably due to a hardware
3146500	3148500	vulnerability and that makes hacking
3148500	3150500	possible in different firmware versions.
3150500	3152500	So future Nintendo Switch units are
3152500	3154500	probably going to have a different SOC.
3154500	3156500	This could also, I would think,
3156500	3158500	be related to maybe what's breaking the docks,
3158500	3160500	but I don't know, we'll see.
3160500	3162500	Going to chat over...
3162500	3164500	And they're checking for the chip that's
3164500	3166500	in the docks, I guess?
3166500	3168500	Perhaps. Going to our chat over
3168500	3170500	at live.vognetwork.com
3170500	3172500	Ranma in chat says it's hard to tell it's third
3172500	3174500	party when the box looks just
3174500	3176500	like first party products. Ain't that the
3176500	3178500	truth? And they do that on purpose.
3178500	3180500	You know they do. And this is Joe and Hunter Matt says
3180500	3182500	yeah, this isn't like an R4 card.
3182500	3184500	It's a dock. Exactly. This isn't like
3184500	3186500	something that you use to pirate software.
3186500	3188500	Right? These third party docks
3188500	3190500	don't give you any additional... Well it's also because
3190500	3192500	their dock costs like $70
3192500	3194500	or something. Is it like $70 or $100
3194500	3196500	for this stupid thing? For what? Pass
3196500	3198500	through for a video? I mean
3198500	3200500	come on. I thought the docks also had
3200500	3202500	like a chip or two in them to give them a little extra
3202500	3204500	oomph, which is why some games can run
3204500	3206500	at 1080 when they're docked.
3206500	3208500	No. No, I don't think so.
3208500	3210500	I thought they did. I don't think so.
3210500	3212500	Are you sure? Alright, maybe.
3212500	3214500	I thought the docks had a little extra
3214500	3216500	because they always talk about
3216500	3218500	it runs like this docked and it runs like this
3218500	3220500	undocked.
3220500	3222500	I don't think that was the case. Interesting.
3222500	3224500	One more comment from chat at live.vognetwork.com
3224500	3226500	Bob C says I'm guessing
3226500	3228500	the third party docks handle the handshake
3228500	3230500	signal different from Nintendo's
3230500	3232500	OEM dock. Yeah, it's definitely got to be something
3232500	3234500	related to that. So a big warning
3234500	3236500	if you're using third party docks
3236500	3238500	stop using them especially
3238500	3240500	if your Switch updated
3240500	3242500	the firmware because a lot of the Switches don't even
3242500	3244500	ask. They don't ask to download the update
3244500	3246500	they just do it. Ah, the Microsoft policy.
3246500	3248500	Yeah, pretty much. Well, I think it's just on
3248500	3250500	by default. I'm pretty sure you can turn it off
3250500	3252500	but I mean
3252500	3254500	for the most part you usually
3254500	3256500	want the new firmware because
3256500	3258500	it patches security leaks
3258500	3260500	and things like that. I know that's the big deal with
3260500	3262500	phones. You know, any time a new phone
3262500	3264500	vulnerability is found the phone
3264500	3266500	companies whether it's Apple, whether it's Android
3266500	3268500	they patch that shit pretty quick and you want to
3268500	3270500	download that. Yeah. So, you know
3270500	3272500	anyway, let's move on to a different story
3272500	3274500	Dark Sakura.
3274500	3276500	Well, in other news
3276500	3278500	Microsoft has some plans
3278500	3280500	that is a little bit different than what
3280500	3282500	they have already been doing.
3282500	3284500	They are wanting
3284500	3286500	to create a service for video games
3286500	3288500	that works like Netflix.
3288500	3290500	They had an interview with The Verge where
3290500	3292500	one of their team members said that they are
3292500	3294500	working on a service that would function the way that
3294500	3296500	Netflix does for games and
3296500	3298500	that would offer access to games
3298500	3300500	from a variety of developers including
3300500	3302500	Microsoft and stream those titles
3302500	3304500	to the player's device of choice
3304500	3306500	so that they could play
3306500	3308500	whatever game they want on whatever
3308500	3310500	device. So
3310500	3312500	they said that their goal is to reach the
3312500	3314500	two billion gamers in the world.
3314500	3316500	So
3316500	3318500	it would extend things
3318500	3320500	out of that whole
3320500	3322500	proprietary
3322500	3324500	market, you know, instead of
3324500	3326500	this is exclusive to this, this is exclusive
3326500	3328500	to this. If you subscribe to the service
3328500	3330500	it streams to whichever device
3330500	3332500	you're on. Yeah, because if you're talking about
3332500	3334500	truly Netflix, I mean the thing that
3334500	3336500	Netflix does is that Netflix
3336500	3338500	is on your TV, Netflix is
3338500	3340500	on your computer, Netflix is on your
3340500	3342500	Nintendo Switch. No, no it's not.
3342500	3344500	It's on your Wii U though.
3344500	3346500	But Netflix is on all these places, it's on
3346500	3348500	your phone. If Microsoft is truly
3348500	3350500	going to look at doing a Netflix for the games
3350500	3352500	this is not like the Game Pass
3352500	3354500	that exists today, right, where you pay
3354500	3356500	which is the same thing as PlayStation Now essentially
3356500	3358500	where you pay a monthly fee to have access to a big
3358500	3360500	library, but it's on your Xbox
3360500	3362500	One. We're talking about you're going to be
3362500	3364500	paying a fee for something
3364500	3366500	that could be anywhere, on a TV
3366500	3368500	or on a phone most notably.
3368500	3370500	Right, so that's very
3370500	3372500	interesting. But
3372500	3374500	of course the one thing
3374500	3376500	that's going to be the problem
3376500	3378500	for this is getting these
3380500	3382500	consoles, the companies
3382500	3384500	that manage these consoles to play
3384500	3386500	nice with the service.
3386500	3388500	Nintendo
3388500	3390500	may not want to because
3390500	3392500	you know how tight and proprietary
3392500	3394500	they are on everything. Sony
3394500	3396500	may play nice. I don't see
3396500	3398500	No they won't. I said may,
3398500	3400500	they'd be more likely than Nintendo to do it.
3400500	3402500	No. I don't see either one of them doing it.
3402500	3404500	They're going to see it as competition.
3404500	3406500	But I get where you're coming from.
3406500	3408500	Hypothetically. But the incentive
3408500	3410500	from offering the service is enough
3410500	3412500	to bring them the money?
3412500	3414500	I would say this, if Microsoft
3414500	3416500	announces they're exiting
3416500	3418500	the console market completely
3418500	3420500	then yes, they would both be open
3420500	3422500	to it. But Microsoft's going to have to say
3422500	3424500	we're no longer selling the Xbox
3424500	3426500	One. How is Xbox One selling
3426500	3428500	right now? I believe
3428500	3430500	it's doing better than it was and
3430500	3432500	I don't think the Xbox One X flopped
3432500	3434500	but I think Microsoft is still kind of
3434500	3436500	losing this console battle
3436500	3438500	and I think it all comes down to exclusives.
3438500	3440500	You know Sea of Thieves is just
3440500	3442500	not God of War. Well and they've also lost
3442500	3444500	one whole complete market
3444500	3446500	because they no longer sell in Japan.
3446500	3448500	That's true.
3448500	3450500	But you know Microsoft is
3450500	3452500	kind of a different, it's a different bar to measure
3452500	3454500	because, but then you have to look at
3454500	3456500	Windows gaming and Microsoft
3456500	3458500	you know, gets a lot of PC
3458500	3460500	games and so when you kind of
3460500	3462500	consider Microsoft's gaming platform
3462500	3464500	as both Windows
3464500	3466500	and Xbox One
3466500	3468500	are they losing? I don't
3468500	3470500	know. I don't think it's really the same.
3470500	3472500	So anyway,
3472500	3474500	food for thought.
3474500	3476500	I still wonder how much
3476500	3478500	of the video game market really
3478500	3480500	is, you know
3480500	3482500	if a person had, you know,
3482500	3484500	now keep in mind the only of those consoles I don't
3484500	3486500	have is an Xbox One.
3486500	3488500	So
3488500	3490500	if some game came
3490500	3492500	out on PC versus a
3492500	3494500	console, I don't know which
3494500	3496500	one gets the larger market share.
3496500	3498500	You know, would it be something on
3498500	3500500	PlayStation 4? Would it be something on PC?
3500500	3502500	Now me, the only reason that I
3502500	3504500	play things on PC is
3504500	3506500	because of the three search fees I've had on my hand.
3506500	3508500	It's more comfortable to play
3508500	3510500	with a keyboard and mouse.
3510500	3512500	But will,
3512500	3514500	but what really does have the highest number
3514500	3516500	of sales? Is it going to be a console
3516500	3518500	or is it going to be
3518500	3520500	a computer? I think it really just
3520500	3522500	depends on what the game is and
3522500	3524500	more importantly, kind of like how it was released.
3524500	3526500	For example, I think something
3526500	3528500	like Overwatch, I think they've said there's way more
3528500	3530500	people playing Overwatch on PC
3530500	3532500	than anything else. But you also
3532500	3534500	have to consider Blizzard's World of Warcraft
3534500	3536500	base, you know, Blizzard's
3536500	3538500	Heroes of the Storm base and all their hardest
3538500	3540500	core fans have always been PC gamers.
3540500	3542500	So of course Overwatch was going to do well
3542500	3544500	on PC. That's not to say it's doing crap on
3544500	3546500	consoles, because it's not, but
3546500	3548500	it's just Blizzard's biggest base was always
3548500	3550500	PC. However, take something
3550500	3552500	like Final Fantasy 15,
3552500	3554500	well it's probably doing better
3554500	3556500	on consoles than it is on PC,
3556500	3558500	but it also had a year out on
3558500	3560500	consoles before it even released on PC.
3560500	3562500	So I think some of that comes into play
3562500	3564500	as well.
3564500	3566500	But Halo,
3566500	3568500	Halo 2,
3568500	3570500	I know you don't like to talk about Halo, but
3570500	3572500	Halo 2 was on PC and
3572500	3574500	Xbox and I think it did better on consoles.
3574500	3576500	So I think it just kind of depends on
3576500	3578500	what the game is and
3578500	3580500	what quote-unquote feels right
3580500	3582500	for the game. Yeah, but
3582500	3584500	that's really what's getting back to my point is the
3584500	3586500	financial impact that one would have versus the other.
3586500	3588500	So, I don't
3588500	3590500	know if
3590500	3592500	sorry, I need to take my
3592500	3594500	medicine, but
3594500	3596500	I don't know if the impact would be
3596500	3598500	greater for one versus the other.
3598500	3600500	Okay. You know, that's my
3600500	3602500	concern. Alright. Well, let's
3602500	3604500	move on to our next story. Loki. Alright,
3604500	3606500	so things are
3606500	3608500	coming back, and by those things they mean
3608500	3610500	microtransactions in Star Wars Battlefront 2.
3610500	3612500	So they are getting rid of
3612500	3614500	the whole loot box system that they
3614500	3616500	tried to pull out, you know,
3616500	3618500	for
3618500	3620500	choice, I don't know.
3620500	3622500	They basically tried to shove that in there
3622500	3624500	and run the game with it. So now,
3624500	3626500	you know, kind of admitting
3626500	3628500	defeat, they're bringing back
3628500	3630500	microtransactions into the game, but it's only
3630500	3632500	going to be for
3632500	3634500	basically cosmetic items. So
3634500	3636500	basically, they're going to be getting rid of the whole loot box
3636500	3638500	and Starbucks. Pink Vader.
3638500	3640500	No Pink Vader yet, because no one wants that.
3640500	3642500	God dammit. So they're going to have
3642500	3644500	progressions going to be linear now,
3644500	3646500	and basically, they're only going to have
3646500	3648500	these cosmetic
3648500	3650500	items that are
3650500	3652500	available in the game as microtransactions.
3652500	3654500	So you can either use
3654500	3656500	in-game credits or crystals, so you can
3656500	3658500	buy premium currency
3658500	3660500	with that. So that's what they're
3660500	3662500	doing, and that's going to start,
3662500	3664500	looks like actually in a few days on March 21st.
3664500	3666500	But
3666500	3668500	if I'm not mistaken, the internet is kind of already
3668500	3670500	over Battlefront, right? Yeah,
3670500	3672500	I think so. I mean, it's taken this long
3672500	3674500	to kind of do the right thing,
3674500	3676500	but it's not even really the right thing, I think,
3676500	3678500	because it's like this...
3678500	3680500	I don't know. The way, like,
3680500	3682500	I've heard it described as like,
3682500	3684500	nobody likes microtransactions
3684500	3686500	in games, so then they pull out this thing
3686500	3688500	that's even worse than microtransactions
3688500	3690500	and then bring that back, and people are like,
3690500	3692500	oh, thank god it's not that thing. I'll take
3692500	3694500	microtransactions.
3694500	3696500	You know, and then
3696500	3698500	in a very morbid...
3698500	3700500	So it's one of those, let me show you just
3700500	3702500	how bad it can be. Okay, okay, it's not that bad.
3702500	3704500	It would be a morbid comparison, but like, if I'm killing,
3704500	3706500	if I'm stabbing puppies, and then,
3706500	3708500	and I, and people are like,
3708500	3710500	don't stab puppies, and so I stab babies
3710500	3712500	instead, and then I stop stabbing
3712500	3714500	babies, and go back to stabbing puppies,
3714500	3716500	they're all like, well, at least he's not stabbing babies anymore,
3716500	3718500	we'll take the stabbing puppies. That's basically
3718500	3720500	what it is, it's that you're getting used
3720500	3722500	to something that you hated, just because it's not the
3722500	3724500	other thing that's even worse. That is the fucking
3724500	3726500	stupidest comparison I've heard in the 15
3726500	3728500	years of this program.
3728500	3730500	I aim to please.
3730500	3732500	What the fuck is wrong with you?
3734500	3736500	And that's basically it, it's just that...
3736500	3738500	This is the same person who came up with Iraqi suicide babies.
3738500	3740500	No, that's a year,
3740500	3742500	years old joke. Uh, just by the way,
3742500	3744500	That was culturally insensitive, I
3744500	3746500	will admit.
3746500	3748500	Some live reaction from our chatroom.
3748500	3750500	Dark Tetsuya says, wow, Loki.
3750500	3752500	Dungeon Buster says, Loki logic
3752500	3754500	can be scary. Psh.
3754500	3756500	Sia Tabiri says, at least he's not putting them in the
3756500	3758500	blender. Alright, Sia Tabiri, you,
3758500	3760500	Loki, you're in timeout. In the
3760500	3762500	corner.
3762500	3764500	And don't look away from the corner
3764500	3766500	until I tell you to.
3766500	3768500	Yeah,
3768500	3770500	I'm over Star Wars Battlefront 2
3770500	3772500	as well, so let's see how they fuck up Star Wars
3772500	3774500	Battlefront 3.
3774500	3776500	I'm sure that'll be a thing. Be careful what you wish
3776500	3778500	for. Alright, well,
3778500	3780500	I know that we're getting
3780500	3782500	into Street Fighter
3782500	3784500	all over again on the Nintendo Switch, and
3784500	3786500	the game that probably should have come
3786500	3788500	out, instead of that Street Fighter
3788500	3790500	2 game that came out originally. It's the
3790500	3792500	Street Fighter 30th anniversary collection.
3792500	3794500	That's right, you can play all
3794500	3796500	of the Street Fighter, including
3796500	3798500	Turbo, Championship, Original,
3798500	3800500	Super, and hey, Dark
3800500	3802500	Sakura would love to play Alpha,
3802500	3804500	Alpha 2, Alpha 3, I bet she's not the only one.
3804500	3806500	And you can even play Street Fighter 3.
3806500	3808500	Cause, how many of you
3808500	3810500	actually remember playing Street Fighter 3?
3810500	3812500	Of course you do,
3812500	3814500	of course you do. I worked in an arcade
3814500	3816500	when Street Fighter 3 came out. Yeah, but like,
3816500	3818500	you know, I think a lot of people kind of forgot
3818500	3820500	that one. But anyway. Oh, come on,
3820500	3822500	it was all about playing Ibuki.
3822500	3824500	This whole collection is going to be coming out, and
3824500	3826500	I know people are jazzed about it. But what's also
3826500	3828500	interesting about it is that there's going to be a
3828500	3830500	kind of a special tournament mode in this.
3830500	3832500	It's an exclusive mode to the Switch,
3832500	3834500	where you use Super
3834500	3836500	Street Fighter 2's tournament mode,
3836500	3838500	and you do this with multiple Switch
3838500	3840500	units, you put them in tabletop mode,
3840500	3842500	and you play musical chairs.
3842500	3844500	So like, basically, all
3844500	3846500	the four Switches are talking to each other,
3846500	3848500	but you're doing your tournament and you're all playing
3848500	3850500	matches at the same time, so it's like you're going to run
3850500	3852500	an eight-player tournament, or maybe more,
3852500	3854500	really, really fast. But
3854500	3856500	some early reports are saying that
3856500	3858500	it does end up kind of being a confusing mess,
3858500	3860500	like which system and controller you need
3860500	3862500	to have for your next match. So you might
3862500	3864500	want to consider maybe having different color controllers
3864500	3866500	or something to label that. But it sounds
3866500	3868500	like it's pretty neat, and it's using the whole, like,
3868500	3870500	you know, Switches talking together in the same room.
3870500	3872500	At least they tried something. Yeah, at least
3872500	3874500	it's something kind of new. I like that. It's almost
3874500	3876500	like the Switch is like now the new
3876500	3878500	version of LAN.
3878500	3880500	That's what this sounds like. It really does. At least they
3880500	3882500	get one type of networking.
3882500	3884500	Right? We'll take
3884500	3886500	offline, I guess. Anyway, so yeah,
3886500	3888500	I think I'm going to check this out, you know.
3888500	3890500	Of course I like the Street Fighter. I mean, I feel like
3890500	3892500	I've bought Street Fighter II so many times,
3892500	3894500	but the fact that they are including, like,
3894500	3896500	the three different versions of Street Fighter III
3896500	3898500	and the alpha games, and, you know,
3898500	3900500	it does kind of sweeten the pot in some of this other stuff.
3900500	3902500	Nothing will ever be the
3902500	3904500	Saturn version of Street Fighter Alpha 2.
3904500	3906500	Nothing? Nothing.
3906500	3908500	Nothing? Unless you have a full arcade release.
3908500	3910500	But, this is just going to probably be an
3910500	3912500	emulated arcade machine. Right?
3912500	3914500	The Saturn version to this day is still
3914500	3916500	the best home version. Well, BobC
3916500	3918500	brings up a good point in our chat saying, question,
3918500	3920500	will be how close to arcade
3920500	3922500	perfect will the ports be, and if it's emulation,
3922500	3924500	how bad will the input lag
3924500	3926500	be? No online alpha 2
3926500	3928500	makes me sad. Alpha 2 is best alpha.
3928500	3930500	So, seems like
3930500	3932500	they are leaving out some modes
3932500	3934500	on some other games.
3934500	3936500	By the way, I want to throw this out
3936500	3938500	to the chat room speaking of Saturn games real quick.
3938500	3940500	If they can hear us with all the
3940500	3942500	frequent drops, sorry, but try your best.
3942500	3944500	If someone can find me a copy of
3944500	3946500	Salamander Deluxe Pack for Sega Saturn
3946500	3948500	for under 50 bucks, please tell me.
3948500	3950500	I'm serious.
3950500	3952500	It's like something you're targeting for the
3952500	3954500	vault next. It's something I'm targeting
3954500	3956500	for the husband.
3956500	3958500	And since he doesn't really listen,
3958500	3960500	I have no problem with saying this
3960500	3962500	in an announcement on live radio.
3962500	3964500	Fair enough. Don't tell them.
3964500	3966500	Alright, but
3966500	3968500	do tell us your next story, DarcSakra.
3968500	3970500	My next story has to do with
3970500	3972500	shenanigans and how
3972500	3974500	people are reacting to it.
3974500	3976500	So,
3976500	3978500	there is a huge
3978500	3980500	labor strike
3980500	3982500	going on
3982500	3984500	with a particular
3984500	3986500	developer, with developers
3986500	3988500	at a French gaming studio.
3988500	3990500	And I know it's one studio.
3990500	3992500	They're the ones who put behind a
3992500	3994500	steel division Normandy 44.
3994500	3996500	The
3996500	3998500	company is called UGen Systems.
3998500	4000500	And
4000500	4002500	the reason why I'm bringing this up,
4002500	4004500	they're on their 30th
4004500	4006500	day on strike, actually more than
4006500	4008500	30 by the time you're listening to
4008500	4010500	this podcast.
4010500	4012500	But
4012500	4014500	they are on strike because
4014500	4016500	of unpaid wages
4016500	4018500	and breached contract.
4018500	4020500	They
4020500	4022500	have refused to pay
4022500	4024500	as required by law.
4024500	4026500	They are
4026500	4028500	underpaying for the value of their work.
4028500	4030500	And so,
4030500	4032500	the quote here is, in order to make ourselves
4032500	4034500	heard, we have no option but to go on strike.
4034500	4036500	And this is started on February
4036500	4038500	15th. And then
4038500	4040500	the distribution was made by a
4040500	4042500	labor advocacy group
4042500	4044500	called, and please bear with me,
4044500	4046500	I have not spoken any French in quite a while.
4046500	4048500	But,
4052500	4054500	the syndicate of video game workers.
4054500	4056500	I hope that sounds right.
4056500	4058500	I actually remember that jeu video is how you say video games
4058500	4060500	in French, yeah.
4060500	4062500	It's game video, yeah.
4062500	4064500	But they are
4064500	4066500	claiming that UGen management
4066500	4068500	did not budge after a 15
4068500	4070500	month negotiation on the topic.
4070500	4072500	And that they put out a counter
4072500	4074500	statement claiming sloppy payroll
4074500	4076500	paperwork. And so,
4076500	4078500	the workers
4078500	4080500	have gone on strike.
4080500	4082500	And I know it's
4082500	4084500	a small company.
4084500	4086500	But I hope it's a
4086500	4088500	precedence. That maybe
4088500	4090500	if more, you know,
4090500	4092500	employees of video game companies
4092500	4094500	unionize and
4094500	4096500	stand up. Do you hear the people
4096500	4098500	sing, sing.
4098500	4100500	That was the French Revolution,
4100500	4102500	Bob.
4102500	4104500	I couldn't help myself.
4104500	4106500	It's obvious, obviously it's the first
4106500	4108500	thing that came to mind. Obviously.
4108500	4110500	I don't mean to make light of it, I'm sorry.
4110500	4112500	We crack stupid jokes on this show.
4112500	4114500	But at any rate, you know,
4114500	4116500	and this is, I'm not trying to be
4116500	4118500	political on this one, but if you think about it,
4118500	4120500	labor unions
4120500	4122500	at least here in the US
4122500	4124500	are why we have
4124500	4126500	an average 5 day work week.
4126500	4128500	It's why we have a 40 hour work week.
4128500	4130500	You know, we have child labor laws.
4130500	4132500	You know, the best way,
4132500	4134500	you know, and we hear about some
4134500	4136500	of the terrible conditions developers
4136500	4138500	work in. If you are
4138500	4140500	a developer and you are in these
4140500	4142500	circumstances,
4142500	4144500	hit them where it hurts.
4144500	4146500	Delay their games.
4146500	4148500	Take a stand.
4148500	4150500	You know, I know Bill's got to get
4150500	4152500	paid, but unionize,
4152500	4154500	you know. And believe me, when the workers
4154500	4156500	are happy, you're going to get a better final product
4156500	4158500	anyway. You don't want to play a shitty
4158500	4160500	game that was rushed and you know.
4160500	4162500	It's like the dinner that, imagine
4162500	4164500	dinner. And imagine
4164500	4166500	I will imagine dinner, thank you.
4166500	4168500	But imagine someone's making it in
4168500	4170500	a huge rush and it just doesn't have any
4170500	4172500	effort put into it. Oh, that's me every week night.
4172500	4174500	Or you have someone who takes
4174500	4176500	time and prepares the ingredients with love in their
4176500	4178500	heart. Oh, Alan cooking.
4178500	4180500	But you know the difference between a
4180500	4182500	dinner created with
4182500	4184500	care versus something that's just like
4184500	4186500	oh, here's food to put in your mouth. I know very well
4186500	4188500	the difference between what Alan cooks and what I cook, yes.
4188500	4190500	Anyway.
4190500	4192500	Am I wrong?
4192500	4194500	I haven't had your cooking, Rob.
4194500	4196500	Let's just say I know how to use a
4196500	4198500	Foreman grill.
4198500	4200500	And that's the end of the sentence.
4200500	4202500	Alright. Well,
4202500	4204500	I'm going to teach you a thing or
4204500	4206500	three one day. I'm going to teach you how to cook
4206500	4208500	Cajun. I don't want to
4208500	4210500	cook Cajun. Well,
4210500	4212500	Cajun is tasty.
4212500	4214500	All right.
4214500	4216500	I have tried. You know what? I tried.
4216500	4218500	I was like, I'm going to go on to like Ina
4218500	4220500	Garten's website and download recipes
4220500	4222500	and I'm going to cook something and like every
4222500	4224500	time I do it,
4224500	4226500	it's like that Netflix show
4226500	4228500	nailed it. Except like my shit
4228500	4230500	is just straight up inedible.
4230500	4232500	I'm like, why did I follow the
4232500	4234500	directions and the chicken is uncooked?
4234500	4236500	I'll tell you this. Honestly enough,
4236500	4238500	and again, not meaning to sell something,
4238500	4240500	but watch the Gordon
4240500	4242500	Z Kitchen Basics and Binging with Babish
4242500	4244500	Kitchen Basics.
4244500	4246500	The two of those will give you
4246500	4248500	practical demonstrations
4248500	4250500	and it makes it easy.
4250500	4252500	What about Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg?
4252500	4254500	Martha Stewart. No, I mean,
4254500	4256500	OK, she's talented. She was a
4256500	4258500	she was a model. She was like Linda Evangelista
4258500	4260500	in the 60s.
4260500	4262500	But but those two
4262500	4264500	actually
4264500	4266500	I was watching the both of those while I
4266500	4268500	was sick for my first month
4268500	4270500	and I used the techniques
4270500	4272500	that they showed there to teach myself how to cook things that I could eat.
4272500	4274500	So just saying.
4274500	4276500	I'm usually not a big advocate
4276500	4278500	for those things, but it's also
4278500	4280500	fun when you learn from someone cooking
4280500	4282500	while you're watching it and they have a passion
4282500	4284500	for it. Same with gaming, right?
4284500	4286500	Someone plays a game they're getting into.
4286500	4288500	You don't care how badly they're playing it.
4288500	4290500	They're having fun. You're having fun with them.
4290500	4292500	There's Twitch in a nutshell.
4292500	4294500	Just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic
4294500	4296500	game of the week. Loki.
4296500	4298500	I'm so confused by
4298500	4300500	I was watching the trailer
4300500	4302500	for this game that I'm about to talk about
4302500	4304500	and I don't understand it, but I get
4304500	4306500	why it's being banned.
4306500	4308500	So, Britain is
4308500	4310500	apparently banning a game called
4310500	4312500	Omega Labyrinth
4312500	4314500	Z, which is also
4314500	4316500	going to be coming out over here pretty soon on PlayStation 4
4316500	4318500	and the Vita.
4318500	4320500	And it's been banned, I guess,
4320500	4322500	in
4322500	4324500	other countries as well. Australia, Germany
4324500	4326500	New Zealand
4326500	4328500	and Ireland.
4328500	4330500	But apparently
4330500	4332500	this is because of
4332500	4334500	the adult-like nature of the game.
4334500	4336500	Basically it has lots of fan service in it.
4336500	4338500	Lots of fan service.
4338500	4340500	The game is kind of like a
4340500	4342500	traditional RPG
4342500	4344500	dungeon crawler type thing, but you collect
4344500	4346500	bras and panties
4346500	4348500	in the game.
4348500	4350500	You also have to rescue women from the
4350500	4352500	monsters that have been trapped there
4352500	4354500	by rubbing
4354500	4356500	basically the women.
4356500	4358500	And then there's something,
4358500	4360500	and I couldn't quite get it because the translation's not
4360500	4362500	right on this page, something that had to do
4362500	4364500	with inspecting breasts.
4364500	4366500	So I'm not really sure
4366500	4368500	what that was, and
4368500	4370500	unfortunately the trailer
4370500	4372500	doesn't really... I could just see
4372500	4374500	myself livestreaming this game, although I'm sure
4374500	4376500	it's banned. Breast inspector
4376500	4378500	checking in. I don't know what it was like.
4378500	4380500	And yet they have what they're
4380500	4382500	putting something
4382500	4384500	like a crystal,
4384500	4386500	if you will, between their breasts
4386500	4388500	to inspect it, but then the crystal's getting
4388500	4390500	bigger. It's clearly a phallic
4390500	4392500	item. It's just like
4392500	4394500	what the fuck is this nonsense?
4394500	4396500	Only the crystal of fallacy can save
4396500	4398500	me.
4398500	4400500	It's just interesting, I guess.
4400500	4402500	That just makes me think of Evangelion
4402500	4404500	Redeath again.
4404500	4406500	Yeah, they have
4406500	4408500	this sequence where
4408500	4410500	you're touching parts of
4410500	4412500	this person that has
4412500	4414500	hearts there, and it's
4414500	4416500	groping... I don't know.
4416500	4418500	I can see why that they may
4418500	4420500	have... I've seen
4420500	4422500	much worse in games, but I understand
4422500	4424500	why this is something that
4424500	4426500	they would be banning from the country.
4426500	4428500	Okay, that's a bit ridiculous,
4428500	4430500	okay? It's just fucking...
4430500	4432500	that's just American beauty shit right there.
4432500	4434500	The fucking flower petals.
4434500	4436500	Oh, yeah.
4436500	4438500	It's ridiculous. They're Japanese
4438500	4440500	companies, man. Making these
4440500	4442500	such lewd games.
4442500	4444500	Where do I pre-order?
4444500	4446500	Where are these?
4446500	4448500	Where do we pre-order these games?
4448500	4450500	No, really, tell me where to find them.
4450500	4452500	I don't know.
4452500	4454500	Alright, well something that won't
4454500	4456500	be banned, because I think a lot of people
4456500	4458500	will be checking this out at their local Dave and Busters
4458500	4460500	or a similar arcade, is
4460500	4462500	Rampage is coming back to arcades.
4462500	4464500	That's right, you know, the classic 90s
4464500	4466500	game, Rampage, which is one of the
4466500	4468500	little mini-games that I got
4468500	4470500	a copy of thanks to DarkSakura.
4470500	4472500	But actually, there is a brand new
4472500	4474500	if you weren't aware, there's a Rampage
4474500	4476500	movie coming out starring The Rock
4476500	4478500	and I don't know. Guys,
4478500	4480500	I have to admit, I don't give a shit
4480500	4482500	about the Rampage movie. Like, I really don't.
4482500	4484500	It has nothing to do with the game. And the trailer
4484500	4486500	looks shitty to me, but some of you guys are into it.
4486500	4488500	Rampage in name only. I'm not gonna
4488500	4490500	really try to
4490500	4492500	crap on your faves, but sometimes it's hard.
4492500	4494500	Anyway, just in time
4494500	4496500	for the film coming out, which by the way is April
4496500	4498500	13th. I don't know if you knew. It's gonna take
4498500	4500500	on Ready Player One. Did you know that?
4500500	4502500	Just a few weeks out. Yeah, because I remember
4502500	4504500	they had to bump it up because
4504500	4506500	the Avengers got bumped
4506500	4508500	up as well. They're like, ah, fuck.
4508500	4510500	Yeah. So, Rampage
4510500	4512500	is coming out April 13th and
4512500	4514500	Dave and Busters, as well as Adrenaline Amusance,
4514500	4516500	they are teaming up to create
4516500	4518500	a new video game based on the film.
4518500	4520500	And guess what? It's a redemption machine.
4520500	4522500	Of course, you get some tickets
4522500	4524500	from it. So anyhow,
4524500	4526500	by the way, this is the sixth new
4526500	4528500	title from Adrenaline in the past six months.
4528500	4530500	So you can see the little picture out there of it.
4530500	4532500	It definitely looks fancy. It looks
4532500	4534500	big. It's got a big TV.
4534500	4536500	And it's got the three players and three
4536500	4538500	sides. I don't think this is gonna
4538500	4540500	look like the classic 90s game at
4540500	4542500	all. But that's kinda cool. It's a single
4542500	4544500	joystick and a button. And the main focus?
4544500	4546500	To play for tickets.
4546500	4548500	Hopefully this means you get to tear down some
4548500	4550500	buildings, though, in a rampage.
4550500	4552500	By the way, speaking
4552500	4554500	of arcade news, I thought this was a good place
4554500	4556500	for me to stick in some news about
4556500	4558500	Step Mania X. You know, this
4558500	4560500	is the new game that Kyle Ward's
4560500	4562500	been working on. Is it Step Mania X or Step Mania X?
4562500	4564500	I think it is Step Mania X,
4564500	4566500	but I can't help but call it Step Mania X.
4566500	4568500	No, it's Ten. Step Mania
4568500	4570500	Ten. I like that. Step Mania Ten.
4570500	4572500	Okay, Step Mania Ten
4572500	4574500	is coming out. I don't think
4574500	4576500	it's really that. But anyway, Step
4576500	4578500	Revolution is the new name of the company.
4578500	4580500	So, these cabinets,
4580500	4582500	they've already kinda been coming out, but
4582500	4584500	they've been targeting, like,
4584500	4586500	exergaming types
4586500	4588500	of places. They haven't really been targeting
4588500	4590500	the arcades. Well, apparently
4590500	4592500	now the arcades are going to be
4592500	4594500	targeted. That is the next
4594500	4596500	direction for the game. How long until Konami
4596500	4598500	sues? Who knows, but new,
4598500	4600500	I don't think they can because I think the layout
4600500	4602500	of this game is different or something. Or actually,
4602500	4604500	I think there's something different
4604500	4606500	where that's been worked out. There is. There's a center button.
4606500	4608500	It's set out like DDR, but there's a center button
4608500	4610500	on there as well. And we know he's
4610500	4612500	worked with Andamiro before.
4612500	4614500	So, there's probably something going on there. But anyway,
4614500	4616500	the and, the thing I liked about it
4616500	4618500	when I saw this at MAGFest a couple years ago,
4618500	4620500	the monitor, the giant monitor is a touchscreen.
4620500	4622500	And that's how you control it. So, the
4622500	4624500	giant monitor is also a touchscreen. That's how you pick your
4624500	4626500	songs. That's how you kinda move things around. I thought that was
4626500	4628500	kinda cool. So, anyway, the machine
4628500	4630500	will set you back $8,000 to $9,000
4630500	4632500	if you want one. But that's
4632500	4634500	actually kinda what the going rate is for
4634500	4636500	Dance Game Machines. They have conversion kits for
4636500	4638500	DDR cabinets, too. Oh, do they? Oh,
4638500	4640500	that I was not aware. So, they would not have touchscreens
4640500	4642500	if that was the case. Yeah.
4642500	4644500	Alright, so anyhow, there you go.
4644500	4646500	You can check that out.
4646500	4648500	They've already secured distribution for Asian
4648500	4650500	territories, but we have no further information
4650500	4652500	on that at this time.
4652500	4654500	But you know what we do have further information on?
4654500	4656500	A trip into the gaming vault.
4656500	4658500	For the Classic Game of the Week.
4658500	4660500	Oh, honey.
4660500	4662500	Forget these arcade machines
4662500	4664500	with fancy, dancy
4664500	4666500	touchscreen machines.
4666500	4668500	Back in the day, your arcade machines
4668500	4670500	ran vector graphics. You liked it.
4670500	4672500	Oh,
4672500	4674500	honey. The Classic Game
4674500	4676500	of the Week. Dark Soccer's gonna jump into the
4676500	4678500	gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
4678500	4680500	hey, even though this game is only
4680500	4682500	in two colors, you should be checking
4682500	4684500	this game out. Yep.
4684500	4686500	Am I right? This wasn't on the color device.
4686500	4688500	No, it was not. Alright.
4688500	4690500	I'm giving you a little hint. Here it is.
4690500	4692500	The Classic Game of the Week.
4692500	4694500	Classic Game of the Week is
4694500	4696500	Wario Land Super Mario Land 3.
4696500	4698500	Which, honestly, shouldn't have been
4698500	4700500	a Mario Land game, but what the fuck ever.
4700500	4702500	It is a platformer developed
4702500	4704500	by Nintendo for the Game Boy
4704500	4706500	in 1994.
4706500	4708500	Yay.
4708500	4710500	It is the first game to feature Wario
4710500	4712500	as a playable character and as the
4712500	4714500	main character and the first
4714500	4716500	appearance of Captain Syrup.
4716500	4718500	Yep. Captain Syrup.
4718500	4720500	Wario Land
4720500	4722500	is, it is a
4722500	4724500	platformer, but it is
4724500	4726500	um,
4726500	4728500	like these different courses, you
4728500	4730500	know, that you go through ending in a boss
4730500	4732500	fight and Wario has the
4732500	4734500	power to bump into enemies or jump
4734500	4736500	on them to knock them over. They are stunned
4736500	4738500	and they can be picked up and thrown at other
4738500	4740500	enemies very, you know, um,
4740500	4742500	Super Mario Brothers 2
4742500	4744500	esque or Doki Doki Panic
4744500	4746500	esque. And then when he's in
4746500	4748500	his grown up form, he can do a shoulder
4748500	4750500	charge that is used to attack
4750500	4752500	enemies or break blocks and open
4752500	4754500	treasure chests.
4754500	4756500	I'm sorry, I've been distracted by the
4756500	4758500	Smoosh. He's adorable.
4758500	4760500	Yes, Mr. Smoosh has made his way into studio
4760500	4762500	which, by the way, I have to
4762500	4764500	add, did you see the Instagram? Did you see the picture
4764500	4766500	of him in his new tie? Yes. Isn't that
4766500	4768500	the most adorable fucking thing you've ever seen?
4768500	4770500	But he didn't, he will wear the
4770500	4772500	tie, but after a little while, he
4772500	4774500	starts to think that it's string
4774500	4776500	that he likes to chase
4776500	4778500	so he starts to, like, scratch that, so
4778500	4780500	I had to take it off him because he was driving himself bonkers.
4780500	4782500	Yeah, but, um,
4782500	4784500	if you follow me on Instagram, look at
4784500	4786500	Dark Sakura, and I have
4786500	4788500	a cute little picture of Smooshy when I trapped him in the
4788500	4790500	bathroom. Well, then you ought to be following
4790500	4792500	Mr. Smoosh, spelled out M-I-S-T-E-R
4792500	4794500	Smoosh, on Instagram.
4794500	4796500	So back to Wario. Oh, yes.
4796500	4798500	Mr. Wario. He can get three unique
4798500	4800500	helmets. Um,
4800500	4802500	each of these helmets have their own ability.
4802500	4804500	There's the bull helmet that gives
4804500	4806500	Wario extra strength and doubles
4806500	4808500	the length of his shoulder charge attack.
4808500	4810500	Sorry, I just have to probably, once again,
4810500	4812500	the two seconds I have Google up
4812500	4814500	never fails. Allen sends me a message on
4814500	4816500	Gchat, which is our preferred way of talking to each other.
4816500	4818500	I pull it up for two seconds to get the YouTube
4818500	4820500	link for tonight. There's the message.
4820500	4822500	Anyway, with that being said,
4822500	4824500	Allen is asking if anyone wants Starbucks,
4824500	4826500	so get your orders in.
4826500	4828500	Can't. Alright.
4828500	4830500	Thank you. Low-key, anything?
4830500	4832500	Very important business, everybody.
4834500	4836500	The stream's probably dropping right now.
4836500	4838500	Anyways, you can't hear this part. Alright.
4838500	4840500	Oh, yes, Wario. Wario box.
4840500	4842500	So, um,
4842500	4844500	the other thing with the
4844500	4846500	bull helmet is that it lets
4846500	4848500	him smash through blocks more
4848500	4850500	easily, and he, um,
4850500	4852500	can stick onto ceilings and
4852500	4854500	perform a butt stomp into the ground, where he
4854500	4856500	can stun all the enemies around him
4856500	4858500	and break through the blocks underneath.
4858500	4860500	He also gets a jet helmet that gives
4860500	4862500	him, uh, increases his running
4862500	4864500	speed and lets him fly
4864500	4866500	horizontally in the air,
4866500	4868500	um, as well to do an underwater
4868500	4870500	shoulder charge.
4870500	4872500	And then the dragon helmet lets
4872500	4874500	Wario shoot, um,
4874500	4876500	like, these bursts of flame,
4876500	4878500	like, as a flamethrower, on land
4878500	4880500	and underwater, which destroys enemies and
4880500	4882500	blocks on contact, and it replaces
4882500	4884500	his shoulder charge while he's wearing the
4884500	4886500	dragon helmet, which the dragon helmet is,
4886500	4888500	honestly, probably one of my favorites.
4888500	4890500	You can also get a star man to get temporary
4890500	4892500	invincibility. Um, if Wario takes
4892500	4894500	damage, he shrinks, losing his shoulder charge
4894500	4896500	move, and he will stay small until
4896500	4898500	he collects a clove of garlic, a
4898500	4900500	helmet, or gets to the end of the level
4900500	4902500	because, you know, Wario's supposed to have a
4902500	4904500	problem with body odor. If he's hit while
4904500	4906500	he's small, or is hit by an
4906500	4908500	instant kill obstacle, like lava,
4908500	4910500	he will lose a life.
4910500	4912500	So, now the coins
4912500	4914500	don't work the way they do
4914500	4916500	in the traditional Mario game. The coins are
4916500	4918500	actually currency. So they can
4918500	4920500	be earned by collecting, fighting them in blocks,
4920500	4922500	shoulder charging enemies. If
4922500	4924500	he acquires ten or more coins in the level,
4924500	4926500	he can pull, um,
4926500	4928500	get a ten coin piece that he can
4928500	4930500	throw at an enemy, and pick back
4930500	4932500	up, so he can throw, he can kill people
4932500	4934500	with money in this game.
4934500	4936500	He can also, um, spend it to open
4936500	4938500	level exits, or activate
4938500	4940500	checkpoints, and extra lives
4940500	4942500	that are, uh,
4942500	4944500	achieved by collecting heart points,
4944500	4946500	which are earned by defeating bosses and
4946500	4948500	collecting hearts. And you get,
4948500	4950500	um, an extra heart, an extra
4950500	4952500	life every 100 points.
4952500	4954500	At the end of each level, you can choose whether to
4954500	4956500	gamble the coins that you have collected in a game
4956500	4958500	of chance, or spend them to try
4958500	4960500	and earn heart points.
4960500	4962500	Um, certain levels have
4962500	4964500	a locked treasure room that, uh,
4964500	4966500	each of them contains a unique treasure.
4966500	4968500	So to use the treasure, you have to find the
4968500	4970500	key within the level, carry it to the treasure room,
4970500	4972500	and you cannot use your abilities
4972500	4974500	while you're carrying the key, kind of like in
4974500	4976500	Dracula X, you know? You pick
4976500	4978500	up the key as your item,
4978500	4980500	and you have to get it to the door before
4980500	4982500	you can use it. Like, it's funny, like, in
4982500	4984500	Dracula X, if you try to use the key, he just gets
4984500	4986500	a question mark, and goes, huh? But
4986500	4988500	I would imagine, yeah, it's very similar
4988500	4990500	that you can't use any of
4990500	4992500	your, uh,
4992500	4994500	your, uh, abilities while you're carrying
4994500	4996500	the key. Um,
4996500	4998500	so,
4998500	5000500	yeah, you can't really do any of these other things
5000500	5002500	until you use the key.
5002500	5004500	And so the game's ending also,
5004500	5006500	uh, depends on
5006500	5008500	how much, how many coins
5008500	5010500	you end with, and how much of the treasure that you've
5010500	5012500	gotten. So,
5012500	5014500	basically, um, the game
5014500	5016500	itself was a big success.
5016500	5018500	It sold, um, 5.19
5018500	5020500	million copies worldwide.
5020500	5022500	And it was listed as one of the most,
5022500	5024500	one of the 13 top Game Boy
5024500	5026500	games, uh, in Game Informer.
5026500	5028500	And it was, to this date,
5028500	5030500	called one of the most successful, uh, spinoff
5030500	5032500	series, I think that's until the Yoshi's
5032500	5034500	series got big. And most importantly,
5034500	5036500	lots of positive reaction from
5036500	5038500	chat to this game. Yeah.
5038500	5040500	Um, it also, uh,
5040500	5042500	it actually was a sequel to Super Mario
5042500	5044500	Land 2, 6 Golden Coins.
5044500	5046500	Um, but it also spawned its own
5046500	5048500	sequels, Virtual Boy Wario Land,
5048500	5050500	Wario Land 2, Wario Land 3,
5050500	5052500	4, and Wario Land Shake It.
5052500	5054500	I was gonna say, they made like 5 Wario, like, they made
5054500	5056500	a ton of these fun games. Wario Land Shake It was such a great
5056500	5058500	game, and it's so sad that it didn't do
5058500	5060500	well. And then other titles,
5060500	5062500	of course, that came out after the success of Wario
5062500	5064500	Land included Wario World, Wario
5064500	5066500	Master of Disguises, and the WarioWare
5066500	5068500	Ink series. Um,
5068500	5070500	also, there were other spinoff
5070500	5072500	titles, um, that referred to
5072500	5074500	Wario Land.
5074500	5076500	There's P-Cross 2, and Wario has
5076500	5078500	Safari Helmet
5078500	5080500	that came in, uh, one of those
5080500	5082500	titles, and Wario's
5082500	5084500	Amiibo board map in Mario Party 10
5084500	5086500	features his Safari Helmet as
5086500	5088500	a background element. In Mario Kart 7,
5088500	5090500	Wario's build
5090500	5092500	transformation is on a billboard in
5092500	5094500	the Wario, uh, Shipyard racetrack,
5094500	5096500	and his music is the main theme of Wario Land.
5096500	5098500	And there you go, that's the game.
5098500	5100500	Alright, awesome, your classic game of the week.
5100500	5102500	All the way back on the Game Boy, and not
5102500	5104500	the Color Game Boy, just the Game Boy.
5104500	5106500	It is, uh, Wario Land.
5106500	5108500	You know what, I don't know if I've mentioned this before,
5108500	5110500	but not necessarily for
5110500	5112500	Wario, because I think Wario's name is a
5112500	5114500	pun on Warui,
5114500	5116500	but I always thought that Waluigi's name was a
5116500	5118500	better pun, because it would be Waruigi.
5118500	5120500	Warui is bad.
5120500	5122500	I didn't think of that.
5122500	5124500	And that, and I think, Waluigi
5124500	5126500	would actually kind of translate to
5126500	5128500	sick man. You know, it's a good
5128500	5130500	thing they didn't put out, uh, pictures of
5130500	5132500	Waluigi in Mario Tennis in high
5132500	5134500	definition, because you know there were people
5134500	5136500	out there this, uh, week trying to figure out just how
5136500	5138500	big Luigi's schlong is,
5138500	5140500	from some of the pictures
5140500	5142500	that are out there where I guess Luigi has a
5142500	5144500	defined, um, bulge.
5144500	5146500	Yeah, he does not have the
5146500	5148500	Barbie doll thing going on. He has things
5148500	5150500	in common with the Goblin
5150500	5152500	King. Yeah.
5152500	5154500	By the way, proven
5154500	5156500	it was a codpiece.
5156500	5158500	Just saying.
5158500	5160500	David Bowie's little friends.
5160500	5162500	Someone did the research. Alright, we're gonna take a break
5162500	5164500	and do some research of our own, but we'll be back with
5164500	5166500	plenty more Orange Lounge Radio, including
5166500	5168500	rapid fire news, release dates, the mail
5168500	5170500	bag, uh, we'll get to some more stories too,
5170500	5172500	including, yep, we gotta talk about
5172500	5174500	Toys R Us. I know we talked about it a little bit last
5174500	5176500	week, but it's coming
5176500	5178500	this week. So we're gonna talk about Toys R Us and
5178500	5180500	KB Toys. Yeah.
5180500	5182500	Yeah, we're gonna talk about all that when we come back, uh,
5182500	5184500	with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after
5184500	5186500	this.
5186500	5188500	Welcome
5188500	5190500	back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio
5190500	5192500	live on this Sunday evening.
5192500	5194500	Episode number 723 of our show
5194500	5196500	for March the 18th of
5196500	5198500	2018. Uh, it's, uh,
5198500	5200500	kind of a rough night here live,
5200500	5202500	um, but, uh, yeah, I wanna thank
5202500	5204500	you guys that are sticking with it, uh,
5204500	5206500	despite all the, uh, intermittent drops and so forth.
5206500	5208500	On the podcast feed, everything sounds normal,
5208500	5210500	I'm sure, cause, uh, that's, that's kinda
5210500	5212500	why we, again, try to keep things going
5212500	5214500	even though there is downtime as soon as
5214500	5216500	by the time y'all download this on the podcast feed,
5216500	5218500	everything sounds normal and just fine the way it
5218500	5220500	is supposed to be. But I appreciate
5220500	5222500	you guys sticking with us live. I also appreciate
5222500	5224500	Bobby Black Wolf is, uh, he's been the one
5224500	5226500	that's been kinda chatting with our, uh,
5226500	5228500	people that we pay money for to host this show
5228500	5230500	and, uh, trying to get everything worked out.
5230500	5232500	I understand maintenance has to be done.
5232500	5234500	It has to be done, like, throughout the week.
5234500	5236500	How many, how many live hours does
5236500	5238500	Voget Network have on it? There's, like, four tonight
5238500	5240500	and two or three on Tuesday.
5240500	5242500	I think that's, like, all the live shows we've
5242500	5244500	had right now. So out of those, like, less than
5244500	5246500	ten hours that we're live a week, this has to be
5246500	5248500	the hour they want to do stuff anyway.
5248500	5250500	Anyway, uh,
5250500	5252500	live here as you're listening to the show,
5252500	5254500	um, hopefully you heard the music there from
5254500	5256500	Soul Calibur. I can't, I can't play that stuff
5256500	5258500	on the podcast feed, cause that would be, you know,
5258500	5260500	they want you to buy the soundtracks and stuff,
5260500	5262500	but, uh, you heard some Soul Calibur music here
5262500	5264500	live, and, uh, it just
5264500	5266500	made me think. It, it missed our show roll tonight
5266500	5268500	cause we, we talked about it a couple weeks ago
5268500	5270500	when it was really, uh,
5270500	5272500	we talked about it a couple weeks ago when it was
5272500	5274500	rumored, and the rumors had a lot of steam with it,
5274500	5276500	but, uh, Geralt, uh, from The Witcher
5276500	5278500	confirmed, so Namco actually put
5278500	5280500	out the trailer that shows him in the game,
5280500	5282500	so everything out there, uh, is confirmed, and,
5282500	5284500	uh, what do you think of that addition, Dark Soccer?
5284500	5286500	I know you've, you're a Soul Calibur fan.
5286500	5288500	I was a Soul Calibur fan. Oh, you're not a Soul Calibur?
5288500	5290500	I haven't played a Soul Calibur game since the
5290500	5292500	GameCube one. Oh, okay.
5292500	5294500	Yeah, so, I really...
5294500	5296500	You didn't even try four? Not really.
5296500	5298500	With, uh, Star Wars? No. Like, Starkiller or something?
5298500	5300500	It just seemed, like,
5300500	5302500	excessive. Yeah.
5302500	5304500	I kinda didn't care anymore.
5304500	5306500	I still love Soul Calibur, except the only Soul Calibur
5306500	5308500	I didn't like was the free one. The free one
5308500	5310500	that was on PlayStation 3 was awful.
5310500	5312500	I don't think I even looked at that one. Oh, don't.
5312500	5314500	It'll ruin the whole series for you.
5314500	5316500	Well, we can't have that, but, I mean, back in the day,
5316500	5318500	though, I mean, Dan and I used to play
5318500	5320500	a bunch of, uh, Soul Edge.
5320500	5322500	Yeah. You know,
5322500	5324500	especially cause it had that, um,
5324500	5326500	amazing soundtrack to it.
5326500	5328500	It was one of the must-have games on the Dreamcast, too.
5328500	5330500	It really was. No, I'm talking about
5330500	5332500	Soul Edge, not the first Soul Calibur. Oh, sorry.
5332500	5334500	Yes. Right. Or Soul Bla-
5334500	5336500	It was Soul Blade, sorry, was the...
5336500	5338500	And it had, oh, god,
5338500	5340500	what was the name of the group that did the
5340500	5342500	intro to it? But it had that amazing
5342500	5344500	intro to it. And we had, um,
5344500	5346500	the soundtrack for it that had, like, the long version
5346500	5348500	of it. It was really awesome. Yeah.
5348500	5350500	So. You know, it was really
5350500	5352500	Soul Calibur 2 was probably the pinnacle of the
5352500	5354500	series for me. I kind of, I remember,
5354500	5356500	you know, just from the music gaming
5356500	5358500	roots of the show, I remember we used to go
5358500	5360500	to Roseville-Gothland and we played DDR.
5360500	5362500	But because there were so many of us playing DDR, you know,
5362500	5364500	we often had to wait, like, 20 minutes in between
5364500	5366500	turns. So there was a lot of us that
5366500	5368500	while somebody else was playing, we'd go play Soul Calibur 2.
5368500	5370500	Yeah. And the arcade machine had that
5370500	5372500	really cool, like, you would log
5372500	5374500	in the machine, right, with, like, your initials
5374500	5376500	and your birthday or something. Yeah. And then you, like,
5376500	5378500	could claim your team, and then you would,
5378500	5380500	like, fight other people. Like, it was a really
5380500	5382500	cool mode that I think
5382500	5384500	was ahead of its time in many ways. And then we'd go find, like,
5384500	5386500	whoever, if we knew who it was, and be like,
5386500	5388500	hey, we just kicked your ass. Yeah.
5388500	5390500	Because the computer would try to emulate that person,
5390500	5392500	but we all know, we all know it was nothing
5392500	5394500	like playing against a real human. Like playing the real thing.
5394500	5396500	There were a few out there that would be kind of
5396500	5398500	tough, that would give them a tough AI. Sure.
5398500	5400500	But, like, you have to really
5400500	5402500	play, like, that character, like, a bunch of times
5402500	5404500	to get the AI to change on it. Yeah.
5404500	5406500	You know. Yeah. So I'm really,
5406500	5408500	I'm going to check out Soul Calibur 6. I'm excited.
5408500	5410500	I kind of, I skipped five.
5410500	5412500	Wasn't five, like, exclusive to PlayStation 3?
5412500	5414500	Or something? I don't remember.
5414500	5416500	I think it was. And I think at that point I was
5416500	5418500	really burned out from the free one and so forth.
5418500	5420500	So I kind of skipped Soul Calibur 5.
5420500	5422500	But I will check out Soul Calibur 6.
5422500	5424500	I'm excited. And I think Geralt is a,
5424500	5426500	it makes sense. It's a logical,
5426500	5428500	like, what video game universe character.
5428500	5430500	Like, they're not going to have Waluigi.
5430500	5432500	Sorry, guys. Waluigi's not going to be Soul Calibur.
5432500	5434500	Wah.
5436500	5438500	I don't know why it's so funny.
5438500	5440500	Just, those big,
5440500	5442500	grandiose intros
5442500	5444500	that they do, you know, like, we shall
5444500	5446500	test the blade of eternity through the soul
5446500	5448500	of time. And then, wah.
5450500	5452500	And then there's, like, a fart.
5454500	5456500	He wears fart caliber.
5456500	5458500	Okay, let's do
5458500	5460500	some rapid fire news. I'm going to get into
5460500	5462500	a laughing fit like I did on this week, Shaking
5462500	5464500	and Crying, which, if you didn't listen to Shaking
5464500	5466500	and Crying this week, cheap plug, but
5466500	5468500	I got into a laughing fit for like, two minutes
5468500	5470500	straight. And it had to do with Thelma and Louise, so I'm gonna
5470500	5472500	leave it at that. Okay.
5472500	5474500	And then they drove off the edge.
5474500	5476500	It's Victoria and I re-enacting it. Anyway,
5476500	5478500	moving on. And remember, don't fuck the guy who
5478500	5480500	wants to steal your money.
5480500	5482500	Moving on, I have to say
5482500	5484500	biiitch.
5484500	5486500	Ahahaha!
5486500	5488500	Alright.
5488500	5490500	Low key. Let's get into some rapid fire news.
5490500	5492500	To register
5492500	5494500	participation for this week's episode of
5494500	5499420	OrangeLaundry80 with VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, boot.
5499420	5502240	Let's talk about Sonic.
5502240	5506960	So Sonic Mania is getting a re-release as Sonic Mania Plus.
5506960	5511260	They're gonna be doing a physical release along with some additional features added
5511260	5512260	to it.
5512260	5517340	So they're gonna have two new playable characters, Mighty and Ray, and a new Encore mode, a four-player
5517340	5518340	competitive mode.
5518340	5519340	Oh no.
5519340	5521740	Wait, is this Mighty number 10?
5521740	5522740	It might be.
5522740	5523740	Oh no.
5523980	5525980	More like Mighty number 2.
5525980	5531940	And a deluxe packaging with a holographic slipcover, reversible Genesis Mega Drive sleeve,
5531940	5533900	and 32-page artbook.
5533900	5536660	And SSG100, Matt, I'm kidding with the Mighty number 9 jokes.
5536660	5538660	It's all in good fun.
5538660	5540620	I did get the game free on PlayStation Plus.
5540620	5541620	Anyway.
5541620	5542620	Yes.
5542620	5543620	Oh yeah, Sonic Mania Plus, yes.
5543620	5544620	As did I.
5544620	5549660	So they'll be coming out this summer on Switch, Xbox One, PlayStation 4.
5549660	5550920	So check those out.
5550920	5554160	That's cool, except for the fact, you know, I already bought this game one time, so I
5554160	5558360	don't know if I'm excited to buy it again, but it was a really solid Sonic game, so.
5558360	5565560	What, are you excited to watch a Sonic Mania Adventures cartoon, perhaps?
5565560	5570640	That's because they're gonna be making five animated shorts starring Sonic Tails and Knuckles
5570640	5577980	as part of the Sonic Mania Adventures, and it's gonna be, they say, a dialogue-free thing
5577980	5583900	that's gonna be relying just on music and visuals to tell the story.
5583900	5586420	Neat, I guess.
5586420	5587420	It's a cartoon.
5587420	5590020	It looks better than the other cartoon that they put out, so.
5590020	5595820	I think it would be okay, because it's not that, whatever that really shitty Sonic thing
5595820	5598820	was, you know, it had no- It's best not to try to remember what it was.
5598820	5603820	Will they be giving Sonic new friends?
5603820	5606100	I think Sonic just needs to find some new friends.
5606100	5608180	Maybe Sonic needs to move to a new city.
5608180	5611420	Maybe it's time for Emerald Hill Zone to no longer be the first act.
5611420	5614260	Maybe- Are you suggesting that he needs, like, new
5614260	5616260	sunk city or something?
5616260	5618340	Yeah, actually, yes I am.
5618340	5626100	He needs to move to New Donk City and be friends with Waluigi!
5626100	5627940	Quick move on before we get back to that.
5627940	5638420	Well, in yet another game tease, there was a post on Twitter teasing a new Sonic Racing
5638420	5639420	game.
5639420	5644620	They have the Sonic R from the Sega Saturn in there as well, but yeah, it says Sonic
5644620	5645620	Racing.
5645620	5652700	I did, however, laugh at the response from CEO Kaz Harai, who said, I'll be excited if
5652700	5656580	it says Sonic Retires.
5656580	5662460	Hey, I like Sonic R. So yeah, new Sonic Racing game.
5662460	5665660	So maybe there'll be a follow-up with a Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing transfer game.
5665660	5666660	That would be cool.
5666660	5668300	It was a great racing game.
5668300	5669300	So yeah.
5669300	5670300	Danica Patrick!
5670300	5671300	Come on!
5671300	5672300	Danica Patrick!
5672300	5673820	Come back to me!
5673820	5675860	What other weird characters could they put in there?
5675860	5681140	They should just, like, just go full all out like, you know, they were doing before.
5681140	5684620	He's not a Sega character!
5684620	5685620	Why would not?
5685660	5687380	Like, Sonic is in Smash Bros.
5687380	5688820	Isn't he in Mario Kart?
5688820	5690740	No, Waluigi is not in Mario Kart.
5690740	5692540	Man, what is all the hate for him?
5692540	5694620	Because Nintendo fucking hates him.
5694620	5696540	At least that's my story and I'm sticking to it.
5696540	5697620	You gave him life.
5697620	5699540	You can't hate him.
5699540	5700540	Yeah?
5700540	5701540	Ehh.
5701540	5702540	Alright.
5702540	5704540	He'll start his own.
5704540	5706780	It'll be just Waluigi Racing.
5706780	5708020	He has his own courses, though.
5708020	5709540	Yeah, I'm all for that.
5709540	5714620	Anyway, you can relive other Sega Genesis classics in an all-new Sega Genesis collection
5714620	5717740	that's coming out for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5717740	5722300	It was leaked through some art that was posted early to Sega's press site and, of course,
5722300	5723660	the press said, well, you posted it.
5723660	5724660	We're running with it.
5724660	5726740	So, Sega did have to confirm it.
5726740	5733620	They are releasing on May 29th for the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, but not the Switch.
5733620	5738900	The Sega Genesis Classics collection, which will contain over, er, more than 50 titles,
5738900	5744420	so yeah, over 50 titles, meaning online multiplayer, achievements, mirror modes, to make the game
5744420	5747100	a little harder, rewind, and save states.
5747100	5752140	You can check out the official page, MegadriveClassics.com, I mean, that's the Europe version, but whatever.
5752140	5753720	You can check that out.
5753720	5758540	Over 50 games in the collection, including, let's see, Sonic the Hedgehog, Altered Beast,
5758540	5763020	Streets of Rage, Space Harrier, Gunstar Heroes, Revenge of Sanobi, Toejam and Earl.
5763020	5766860	I know I saw the Alex Kidd Genesis game in there, too, so that's cool, because that wasn't
5766860	5769380	in the last collection, so yeah, very cool.
5769380	5774740	But yeah, no Nintendo Switch version, although, Loki, wanna guess?
5774740	5776620	Why aren't they gonna put this on Nintendo Switch?
5776620	5780020	Virtual Console, that doesn't exist, but, you know.
5780020	5783380	But will eventually, and they can charge you $5 a pop.
5783380	5786300	Because they're greedy fuckers, and they, you know.
5786300	5787300	You'll pay it.
5787300	5789300	Well, maybe not you specifically, but somebody will.
5789300	5790300	No, I'm not gonna pay it.
5790300	5795060	I'll just get one of their fucking, I don't know, I'll get something.
5795060	5796460	I'll use my PC!
5796460	5799020	Well, maybe you'll pay for this.
5799020	5803720	Super Bomberman R, which was a pretty successful Switch game, considering, you know, it was
5803720	5806100	a launch Bomberman title, it did pretty well.
5806100	5810220	It's actually gonna come out on other platforms, but this is interesting, each platform is
5810220	5812500	getting an exclusive character.
5812500	5817180	So Super Bomberman R is gonna be released for the Xbox One, with the little chibi Master
5817180	5820100	Chief will be added to the bombing arena.
5820100	5824900	And for the PlayStation 4, you get Ratchet, from Ratchet and Clank, we'll be joining that.
5824900	5829700	And again, this is pretty cool, on the PC, you will get Peabody, from Portal 2.
5829700	5832000	He was one of the co-op robots.
5832000	5836460	So Peabody from Portal will be an additional character in that game.
5836460	5837860	That's pretty neat.
5837860	5842460	So you can check that out with all the DLC and updates, of course, will be included in
5842460	5843460	that.
5843460	5844460	That's another thing they did very well with that.
5844460	5848620	June 12th is when they all come out, except the PC version is a day late.
5848620	5853940	But essentially that same week is when all those versions of Super Bomberman R come out.
5853980	5854980	Dark Sakura.
5856500	5859380	More stuff coming out.
5859380	5866080	Hamster is bringing stuff out to the Japanese eShop for Nintendo.
5866080	5872540	We have the ACA Neo Geo World Heroes 2 Jet and Moon Patrol will both be coming out on
5872540	5874780	March 22nd.
5874780	5877700	World Heroes is actually a really fun series.
5877700	5881660	It wasn't amazing, but it was really fun.
5881660	5888800	And then Bad Dudes vs. Dragon Ninja will be out for the Switch on March 21st, I guess
5888800	5890300	as the prelude.
5890300	5894140	But are you a bad enough dude to beat the Dragon Ninja?
5894140	5899660	Well, I know the line is usually, are you a bad enough dude to save the president?
5899660	5900660	And I'm just kind of going-
5900660	5901660	Why would you want to?
5901660	5904740	Do I want to?
5904740	5909780	Are you a bad enough dude to totally not give a shit about saving the president?
5909780	5912620	Why yes, we are.
5912620	5920380	And then Microsoft's E3 2018 press conference has a date that will be June 10th for those
5920380	5921380	who care.
5921380	5926620	I probably care more about that than I do about saving the president.
5926620	5931580	I probably care more about a stinky dog shit than the president.
5931580	5933580	Just saying.
5933580	5936540	Well I'm excited for Microsoft's press conference.
5936540	5941140	You know, again, I want to see what big stunts they pull this year, you know, what big exclusives
5941140	5942140	they're going to announce.
5942140	5944180	They got to put out a date for Crackdown 3.
5944180	5946260	That one keeps getting pushed back and back.
5946260	5947620	That's got to be this holiday.
5947620	5948620	They don't have any time left.
5948620	5949620	I've stopped caring.
5949620	5950620	Really?
5950620	5951620	Yeah.
5951620	5952620	It's taking too long.
5952620	5953620	All right.
5953620	5954620	I've got PC that can run it, so who gives a shit?
5954620	5955620	Yeah.
5955620	5956620	Well, yeah, there you go.
5956620	5957620	When it comes out, you'll get it on PC.
5957620	5958620	Of course you will.
5958620	5959620	Yeah.
5959620	5960620	That's still a win for Microsoft.
5960620	5961620	So.
5961620	5962620	All right.
5962620	5963620	Anyway-
5963620	5964620	Is it though?
5964620	5965780	Because I would have bought their system if they hadn't put it on PC.
5965780	5968220	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5968220	5969220	Loki.
5969220	5970220	All right.
5970220	5975500	So, coming out this week, we've got Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered on PlayStation 4 and
5975500	5983060	Xbox One, Assault Gunners HD Edition on PC and PlayStation 4, Attack on Titan 2 on PC
5983060	5986740	Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5986740	5994020	We have Sea of Thieves coming out this week on Windows 10 and Xbox One, Valkyria Chronicles
5994020	6003460	4 on PlayStation 4, Way Out on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Detective Pikachu on the
6003460	6010220	3DS, and Bobby's new favorite game, Ni No Kuni 2, Revenant Kingdom is coming out this
6010220	6011220	week.
6011220	6012700	Mark your calendar, Bobby.
6012700	6014740	That is out on PC and PlayStation 4.
6014740	6016740	They do have a demo available.
6016740	6017740	Oh, do they?
6017740	6018740	I think so.
6018740	6019740	Oh, great.
6019740	6021000	Couldn't give it a whole other try there.
6021000	6022940	What a great wedding present for Bobby.
6022940	6023940	There you go.
6023940	6026780	And that's it for this week.
6026780	6027780	All right.
6027780	6029780	Moving on to Japan.
6029780	6033260	Let's get in a plane and travel to Japan and check out some of the releases they get this
6033260	6035580	week, including on the PlayStation 4.
6035580	6040420	Senju no Valkyria 4 comes out on the PlayStation 4.
6040420	6044660	And yeah, that is, I believe that is their version of Valkyria Chronicles.
6044660	6048300	Is that just like a reimagining of the old game or is this like a new one?
6048300	6049820	I didn't know there was a new one coming out.
6049820	6051620	I think it is a new one.
6051620	6053620	And yeah, it's Valkyria Chronicles 4, basically.
6053620	6054620	That's pretty cool.
6054620	6057340	So that's coming out on the PlayStation 4 this week.
6057340	6060180	Also, I guess that's it.
6060180	6063100	There's a whole new PlayStation 4 to support that coming out.
6063100	6064280	And that is the only release.
6064280	6065860	That's a pretty big deal, though.
6065860	6066940	Is that also on the Vita?
6066940	6069180	I'm asking myself, no, it is not.
6069180	6072460	But you can check out Ikemen Sengoku.
6072460	6079780	Toko o Kakeru Koi comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita, as is a game called Dance
6079780	6082540	with Devils, My Carol.
6082540	6083540	I don't know.
6083540	6084540	Is it like Carol Channing?
6084540	6085540	Like who?
6085540	6087500	Dance with Devils or is that like Carol is a song?
6087500	6088500	I don't know.
6088500	6089500	But anyway.
6089500	6090500	I don't know.
6090500	6093340	But Carol Channing is still kicking and I'm afraid for the world while she's still alive.
6093340	6100000	Every single screenshot is like some hetero anime couple dancing in a meadow.
6100000	6101060	And that's like all this is.
6101060	6105620	Oh, and then you got this guy in a cape because there's always some guy in a cape in these
6105620	6106620	anime games.
6107460	6111900	But he's in a cape, so you know he's cool and he's badass.
6111900	6117520	On the Nintendo Switch this week, let's see, Zelda Musou Hyrule All Stars comes out this
6117520	6118520	week.
6118520	6119520	That is probably a big release.
6119520	6122180	That, of course, is the Hyrule Warriors release on the Switch.
6122180	6128240	And then Pri Para All Idol Perfect Stage also out in Japan this week, because if you don't
6128240	6133940	have enough idol games to play, then you can check out this very pink and purple and OMG,
6133940	6140940	we're all very super quite happy to be here game where, oh, I thought she was playing
6140940	6144960	maracas in that screenshot first, but it turns out it just the background makes it look like
6144960	6150420	she's playing a heart, like she's shaking a valentine and that's how she plays the instrument.
6150420	6151420	I don't know.
6151420	6152420	The other one claps her hands.
6152420	6153420	That's a lot easier to follow.
6153420	6154420	I clap my hands.
6154420	6155420	I'm contributing too.
6155420	6157540	What's your role in the band?
6157540	6158540	I'm the clapper.
6158540	6161220	I clap my hands together.
6161220	6163060	How about the UK, Dark Sakura?
6163060	6164540	A few things.
6164540	6174020	We have on the 20th Sea of Thieves for looks like Xbox One and as well as the the big bundle
6174020	6180680	for it, Titan Quest Anniversary Edition for Xbox and PlayStation.
6180680	6186240	Also on the 20th, we have Assassin's Creed Rogue for Xbox and PlayStation.
6186240	6193960	We have AoT2 by Koei Tecmo on, that's Attack on Titan by the way, on PlayStation, Xbox
6193960	6195560	and Switch.
6195560	6205240	We have Detective Pikachu on the 23rd, which is going to be adorable.
6205240	6210120	We also have WWE 2K18 WrestleMania edition.
6210120	6212080	We have A Way Out.
6212080	6213840	I'd like a way out.
6213840	6221000	Ni No Kuni 2 Revenant Kingdom and that's it for this week.
6221000	6225520	All right, well then I think with those releases, it's time to jump into the mailbag.
6225520	6226520	No.
6226520	6227520	Yes.
6227520	6228520	No.
6228520	6235280	Every week, you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com and no server issues
6235280	6236280	there.
6236280	6240520	Dark Sakura's going to dive into the mailbag and pick out her favorite emails, which really
6240520	6243400	is usually all the emails, unless you're a spammer.
6243400	6245120	She filters out the spam.
6245120	6247820	She sends the spam- I banish it to the sticky room.
6247820	6249240	Back to whence it came.
6249240	6250760	So here it is.
6250760	6254520	The emails, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6254520	6263320	Hello L.R. as they say, that's not how, that's not how YYR does it, Robert M. He does H-E-L-L
6263320	6266960	capital O-L-R instead of doing it as two words.
6266960	6269520	So just telling you if you're going to do it, do it right.
6269520	6271560	But clever of you to try.
6271560	6277720	One of the first YouTube videos I remember seeing was piano player Tom Briar, who I have
6277720	6282880	done for Fortune Cookie a few times, who was sadly incapacitated in the severe auto accident
6282880	6287960	sight reading an arrangement of KK Slider's KK Ragtime from Animal Crossing, which he
6287960	6290140	declared, that's cute.
6290140	6294840	Other Ragtime video game music he's included the themed Capcom's Ghosts and Goblins, the
6294840	6300680	athletic theme from Yoshi's Island, the piano version of the chirpy, barely dog song from
6300680	6304680	Undertale, which works shockingly well as a Ragtime composition.
6304680	6307460	What's your favorite other Ragtime video game themes?
6307460	6309760	Does anything from Cuphead fall into Ragtime?
6309760	6313600	The closest I can think of is a Dixieland themed winner take all music, and I'm not
6313600	6315640	sure that's Ragtime per se.
6315640	6320360	I'm sure Rob has several Commodore 64 games which explicitly use Joplin's music.
6320360	6327040	Speaking of the C64, I did see Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb playing a fan made port of Bruce
6327040	6328880	Lee for the Sega Master System.
6328880	6331920	Okay, so Ragtime, Ragtime is just a style.
6331920	6337680	A song doesn't need to specifically be Ragtime to be able to be played in the Ragtime style.
6337680	6343520	And my favorite one to this day is another one of Tom Breyer's videos, where he does
6343520	6350840	the Super Mario World ending, and then just starts free, just completely using that theme
6350840	6353680	and doing his own variations on it, it was really good.
6353680	6362280	He also did, um, it's one of the other Super Mario World musics where, um, usually it's
6362280	6366640	on the ones where you have the little platforms that move across and you have to ride the
6366640	6369000	platforms on switch boxes and stuff.
6369000	6374640	I can't help but think of the old theme song to Hoard House, which is my favorite Ragtime
6374640	6375640	music.
6375640	6379040	And I don't, did people ever get the joke there?
6379040	6383960	Let me just, let me, you guys know the full name of the show was the best little Hoard
6383960	6389100	House in Azeroth, which, you know, the best little whorehouse in Texas.
6389100	6394000	So it was supposed to be like a Ragtime song to make you think of an old saloon where whores
6394000	6395000	are.
6395000	6396000	That was the joke.
6396000	6397000	I don't know.
6397000	6398000	So the Maple Leaf Rag was the theme to that show.
6398000	6399560	The Maple Leaf Rag is actually a classic.
6399560	6405960	I'm also a fan of Gershwin's Rialto Ripples from 1917, which I believe you can also hear
6405960	6409040	on the player piano at Disneyland.
6409040	6412500	You are absolutely right though, that a ton of Commodore 64 stuff would use like Ragtime
6412500	6414440	style music in their games.
6414440	6418120	Um, didn't Tapper use it in that game?
6418120	6419120	That's what I'm thinking of.
6419120	6422040	I could never really hear it the last few times I've played it cause it's at Calix stream.
6422040	6425040	I feel like it was, that's the game that comes to mind.
6425040	6427760	Of course, in the moment when I'm trying to think of something, I can't think of anything.
6427760	6430680	I know it was the background music in several games.
6430680	6435000	Like I remember there was this weird Commodore 64 game that we had that was like, you were
6435040	6440320	decorating a house and that's what it was, it was like a house decorating game.
6440320	6443840	And I think it was supposed to be something for like people that wanted to pretend that
6443840	6447240	they had a big old house to decorate cause you could decorate mansions and stuff.
6447240	6450380	And it would just play like Ragtime music in the background while you were working.
6450380	6454360	So I have no idea what that music had to do with house decorating, but that's what's coming
6454360	6455360	to my mind right now.
6455360	6457500	Loki, do you have any interest in Ragtime?
6457500	6459120	I have no idea what we're talking about.
6459120	6461160	I have no idea what Ragtime music is.
6461160	6465680	It's a style of music that's like, think of like old saloons, old westerns music.
6465680	6470560	It's more or less the style that was out between, I'd say 1910 and 1925.
6470560	6472120	My favorite genre of music?
6472120	6473120	No.
6473120	6474120	I have no idea.
6474120	6475120	I don't know.
6475120	6476120	Well, we've got to follow up to that email.
6476120	6477120	Okay.
6477120	6480400	And to start it off, I really need to stop having to do these follow up emails.
6480400	6484440	After another listen to the Cuphead soundtrack, the music to the forced follies level, one
6484440	6487120	of the first run and gun segments is clearly Ragtime.
6487120	6489520	That also is Robert M.
6489520	6494160	So next email comes from Chris.
6494160	6496840	Hello, OLR crew.
6496840	6500320	First thing I want to say is the call from Ronmo was a great perspective to hear on the
6500320	6501960	gaming slash gun control issue.
6501960	6504360	It was heartfelt, emotional and real.
6504360	6506640	Thanks Rob for letting the call go over.
6506640	6507640	You're welcome.
6507640	6509120	I think that was a really power.
6509120	6511000	I'm sorry you weren't here, Jamie, to hear it.
6511000	6512000	I think you would have really had a-
6512000	6514880	I was already sorry I wasn't here, but I'm extra sorry now.
6514880	6519040	I think you would have really had a lot to say on that piece, but we had a lot.
6519040	6522680	We had a lot of callers share some very, very powerful stuff.
6522680	6525680	It was a bonding by the campfire night for sure.
6525680	6528000	So I had no problem letting that go on.
6528000	6534560	Well, next I wanted to say thank you for giving us podcasts all these years.
6534560	6538640	I've been listening for a long time and I've enjoyed your real takes on subjects that other
6538640	6540400	gaming podcasts don't.
6540400	6542160	Last week was a great episode.
6542160	6546600	My question, however, is something that all gaming podcasts go over, but I still find
6546600	6548240	interesting to hear every time.
6548280	6552080	I wanted to ask you, what do you think we will see from E3 this year and what do you
6552080	6553400	hope gets announced?
6553400	6554400	Oops.
6554400	6556800	Sorry, I went early.
6556800	6560440	I'm excited to finally see the Kingdom Hearts 3 release date.
6560440	6565580	I also want to hear more about the Spyro trilogy, Smash Brothers, and maybe that Avengers game
6565580	6567440	from Crystal Dynamics.
6567440	6572520	I'm expecting to see a 2019 release date for The Last of Us Part II and a wild prediction
6572520	6576680	I'll throw out there for Microsoft as the new Banjo Kazooie so that they can win back
6576680	6577680	fans.
6577960	6581240	Once again, thanks for producing these shows and helping me get through my early morning
6581240	6582240	commutes.
6582240	6586280	Also, I sincerely hope the next console generation won't fuck us over.
6586280	6587280	That's Chris.
6587280	6588280	Thanks for the email, Chris.
6588280	6591920	What I'd like to see is something meaningful for VR.
6591920	6599360	I think necessarily, even on PC, or any VR platform actually, there hasn't really been
6599360	6607080	like that game that you can kind of define this is why I need VR type of thing.
6607080	6612840	There's a lot of fun games to play, but Sony I don't think has any big first party games
6612840	6618640	that are like, wow, that's like, this sold me the VR platform type thing.
6618640	6620800	I would like to see something like that.
6620800	6624960	Although I do enjoy playing everything that's on there, it's just, you know, more is better.
6624960	6629960	Well, I told you my big thing earlier about what I would dare Microsoft to do.
6629960	6633920	I would say outside of that, something I was thinking about today, so I was randomly watching
6633920	6636960	footage of Final Fantasy XV from PC.
6636960	6641960	I was rewatching the ending actually of Final Fantasy XV and I, you know, with all the problems
6641960	6647960	that game had, and there were problems, the ending to that game was really fucking good.
6647960	6650520	And that's something Final Fantasy games don't always get right.
6650520	6653280	And again, I'm not going to spoil, but you can probably figure out what happens.
6653280	6654280	It's a Final Fantasy game.
6654280	6656200	Of course, you know, it ends.
6656200	6657200	Everyone dies.
6657200	6658200	No one lives.
6658200	6660480	Well, I can't really tell you.
6660480	6664520	But anyway, it's such a fucking good ending in Final Fantasy XV.
6664520	6669360	It had me thinking, why are we hearing about Final Fantasy XVI yet?
6669360	6670880	Where's the news on Final Fantasy XVI?
6670880	6675480	I know, yes, I know about the VII remake and where is that and all that good stuff.
6675480	6679560	But I mean, if you logically think about it, okay, Kingdom Hearts III is going to be the
6679560	6683380	Christmas game this year because they've already said 2018.
6683380	6684840	So that's that.
6684840	6688400	So I would imagine maybe Final Fantasy VII remake is going to be like the winner release
6688400	6692000	next year, hopefully, hopefully, or at least episode one or whatever.
6692000	6697400	I think it's I think it's time to tease us a little bit with that number 16.
6697400	6698400	Let's see.
6698400	6699520	Let's see at least what direction they're going in.
6699520	6700520	And I'm...
6700520	6701520	If they're out of ideas.
6701520	6703960	Please, prayer circle with me, everybody.
6703960	6704960	Everybody out there.
6704960	6705960	Everybody out there in podcast land.
6705960	6709720	I'd like you to join hands and prayer circle with me here.
6709720	6714980	Final Fantasy XVI, please take it back to the Final Fantasy roots.
6714980	6718120	I want my black mages to look like black mages.
6718120	6721240	My white mages look like white mages, red mages.
6721240	6724400	I want the feather in their cap.
6724400	6725880	Final Fantasy IX.
6725880	6726880	Like that.
6726880	6727880	Like, remember that?
6727880	6729920	That's that's like what I want in Final Fantasy XVI.
6729920	6731640	What about Final Fantasy...
6731640	6732640	That style.
6732640	6734200	But, you know, new story.
6734200	6737000	What about like Final Fantasy VI?
6737000	6738540	I'm totally OK with that.
6738540	6740480	I'm totally OK with that.
6740480	6743680	I wish VI was what they were remaking instead of VII.
6743680	6749340	More like steampunk magic stuff, you know, than like this is the future and future.
6749340	6753180	I am totally OK with that.
6753180	6754180	Totally fine with that.
6754180	6755180	All right.
6755180	6756180	There's there's my my prediction or whatever.
6756180	6760380	I'll just take a remake of Final Fantasy VI in the Final Fantasy XV engine.
6760380	6761380	Yes.
6761380	6762380	Yes.
6762380	6763380	Would be fucking amazing.
6763380	6765380	Just make a new game in XV's engine to save you time.
6765380	6766740	I want a Metroid game that doesn't suck.
6766740	6767740	You want what?
6767740	6768740	I want a Metroid game.
6768740	6769740	A new Metroid game that doesn't suck.
6769740	6771060	Well, there is Metroid Prime 4.
6771060	6772060	I know.
6772060	6773060	Or do you want a 2D game?
6773060	6774060	I say...
6774060	6775060	I want a 2D game.
6775060	6776060	Go for a 2D game.
6776060	6780580	Go for a WarioWare Shake It or no, Wario Land Shake It, because that was a gorgeous
6780580	6782580	like hand drawn 2D game.
6782580	6788660	And have them do like a, you know, a nice Metroid game or even hell, was it the company
6788660	6794900	has been doing all the like, was it the one that did DK and what else do they do?
6794900	6799180	Like I can't remember the name of the company now.
6799180	6800180	Think Retro is in the title.
6800180	6801180	Yeah.
6801180	6802180	RetroWare or something like that.
6802180	6803180	Yeah.
6803180	6804180	Have them do one.
6804180	6805180	Oh, I want.
6805380	6807020	And Jamie, you're going to agree with me on this.
6807020	6809020	The guys that did Blaster Master Zero.
6809020	6810020	Yes.
6810020	6811020	I want it.
6811020	6812020	Is it Arc?
6812020	6814100	Is that who's what was the name of the company that did Blaster Master Zero?
6814100	6817140	I want that company doing a Guardian Legend game.
6817140	6818140	Yes.
6820140	6822140	But what is Compile done lately?
6822140	6825340	I think they do like anime games in Japan.
6825340	6827340	They don't do anything that's released here really.
6827340	6829340	And they're Compile Heart.
6829340	6837460	Compile owns, has the Puyo Puyo still, the Puyo Puyo license, at least they're the company
6837460	6839460	that put out Puyo Puyo.
6839460	6841220	Oh, so is that their thing now?
6841220	6842220	Oh, Inti Creates.
6842220	6845100	They, I had to look it up who the company was that made the game.
6845100	6848860	And now I'm looking, they've been around a while Inti Creates actually made like Mega
6848860	6855180	Man Zero on the Game Boy Advance, Galgun and Galgun 2 are their more recent releases there.
6855180	6857860	Mighty Gunvolt is something else they did.
6857900	6861140	Mighty No. 9 is something we forgive them for.
6861140	6862940	Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures.
6862940	6867260	But anyway, so yeah, I want them doing a Guardian Legend game please, thank you.
6867260	6868260	So last email.
6868260	6869260	Yes.
6869260	6870260	Hello, LR.
6870260	6872460	That, by the way, is how it works.
6872460	6873460	Oh, is it YYR?
6873460	6874460	It's YYR.
6874460	6875460	Of course it is.
6875460	6878240	I've been busy, so I fell a week behind on OLR.
6878240	6881580	Now that I've listened to the last two shows over the past few weeks, I've got a lot to
6881580	6882580	say.
6882580	6885660	So this long-winded guy will try for some rapid fire responses.
6886460	6891540	First off, thanks Jamie, oh you're welcome, for highlighting the Negecon, remember we
6891540	6895940	had to learn how to say it, Negecon, one of my all-time favorite controllers.
6895940	6900860	One great thing about it that wasn't mentioned were the two analog face buttons.
6900860	6905180	They came up far beyond the surface of the controller and had a long travel distance,
6905180	6910380	making it easy to step on the gas or brake exactly as far as you wanted.
6910380	6914820	One more thing to note, at the time the Negecon released, it was the only available option
6914860	6919500	for handheld analog control, as the dual shock and the dual analog controller that preceded
6919500	6921900	it were still two years away.
6921900	6930100	Rob, you mentioned a new first-person shooter made with the old build engine, releasing
6930100	6933540	on Steam at $17.99, and you questioned the price tag.
6933540	6938340	I will only respond with a simple question, have you ever paid more than $18 for a 2D
6938340	6939340	pixel art game?
6939340	6944620	If your answer is yes, perhaps you'll agree with me when I say old engine 3D game could
6944620	6948660	be the next 2D pixel art game if the audience turns out to be there.
6948660	6952540	I'm gonna say yes, but they weren't first-person shooters.
6952540	6954340	That's the difference.
6954340	6957980	Next up, I'm sorry that I can't remember who said it, but a comment from chat said something
6957980	6960100	like SNES Classic is impossible to get.
6960100	6962820	I just wanted to say that it's actually not.
6962820	6967540	A few weeks ago at my local Best Buy in Hartsdale, New York, one was simply sitting there in
6967540	6970700	the Nintendo section, so don't give up, check your stores.
6970700	6975340	I've actually been watching it online because I check maybe at least once a week just to
6975340	6979580	see what the secondary markets look like, like eBay and stuff, and I've actually seen
6979580	6984940	some NES classics that are, someone's like, okay, it's barely used, $70, just get it out
6984940	6985940	here.
6985940	6989900	I mean, so they're starting to come down.
6989900	6993140	I also wanted to congratulate both Rob and Loki for the weight loss progress that they
6993140	6994140	mentioned last week.
6994140	6995740	Awesome job, keep it going.
6995740	6996740	Thanks.
6996780	7002740	I will go ahead and say now, I'm not going to go too much into detail, but since October
7002740	7010540	last year, I have dropped 67 pounds, so we're all losers in this room.
7010540	7013260	As I sit here and sip on this Frappuccino.
7013260	7017340	Yeah, that was all excess.
7017340	7018780	With non-fat milk.
7018780	7020580	Mr. Smooch isn't a loser.
7020580	7021580	No, I love Mr. Smooch.
7021580	7022580	He's got a little belly on him.
7022580	7024460	He's gotten fatter since we adopted him.
7024460	7025460	Yeah.
7025460	7026460	I don't know if you know, he's got fat.
7027180	7028180	He got some tummy.
7028180	7029180	That's all right.
7029180	7030180	That's okay.
7030180	7031180	Kitty Pudge is cute.
7031180	7035380	And, but yeah, 67, I kind of almost fainted.
7035380	7036380	Congrats.
7036380	7037380	Thank you.
7037380	7039380	So what was your, what was your success?
7039380	7044700	Oh, you had, I've lost 10 pounds since a few weeks ago.
7044700	7045700	Cool.
7045700	7046700	Loki.
7046700	7047700	It's been actually two months.
7047700	7048700	Congrats.
7048700	7049700	I am proud of you guys.
7049700	7050700	Thank you.
7050700	7055220	And now I want to speculate as to why WART has not come back.
7055220	7057780	Well, we've lost count of how many times Bowser has shown up.
7057780	7059260	I want to hear this.
7059260	7060780	It's not because they killed him.
7060780	7063660	It was because he never actually existed to begin with.
7063660	7064660	Remember it was all a dream.
7064660	7068660	Well, if you tell me, well, that was, what about Shy Guy?
7068660	7071260	Just recall that real life things appear in dreams all the time.
7071260	7072260	See?
7072260	7075780	You just gave the answer I was going to give.
7075780	7077220	Dreams are based in reality.
7077220	7084600	However, the original incarnation of WART was not in an actual real dream.
7084600	7087480	It was supposed to be that they were kidnapped into the.
7087480	7088480	That's true.
7088480	7091040	Cause they stole all that from doki doki panic.
7091040	7092040	Precisely.
7092040	7093040	Hmm.
7093040	7094040	Good call.
7094040	7097120	So WART is the dead emperor of his own dimension.
7097120	7100120	I just think that Bowser has never been killed.
7100120	7102400	Where WART, that was a dead frog.
7102400	7103400	Sorry.
7103400	7104720	That, that was dead fog.
7104720	7106000	Well, crunchy frog.
7106000	7108020	Nothing is ever really dead in a Mario game.
7108020	7109020	Come on.
7109020	7110020	But WART is.
7110020	7111020	Wah.
7111020	7112020	Wah.
7112020	7113020	Wah.
7113060	7117500	I think they get the frog suit from wearing his skin.
7117500	7121980	On the question of why Luigi's Mansion remake is coming to 3DS and not to the Switch.
7121980	7125560	I remember hearing that one of the things the developers wanted for the original game
7125560	7126740	was 3D.
7126740	7128780	This is now possible, but not on Switch.
7128780	7130220	So maybe that's why.
7130220	7131220	Okay.
7131220	7132220	But like you could have done it.
7132220	7133220	They don't ever use 3D in the 3DS anymore.
7133220	7134700	You could have done it five years ago.
7134700	7135700	Come on.
7135700	7138540	I think it's because they have the engine for the last game and they can just port it
7138540	7139540	over to that engine.
7139540	7141380	But you know what?
7141380	7142380	Wah.
7142740	7143740	Yeah.
7143740	7146860	That's how you, that's how you, that's how you get me to buy it.
7146860	7147860	Wah Luigi's Mansion.
7147860	7148860	Wah Luigi's Mansion.
7148860	7151460	I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have said a god damn thing if it was Wah Luigi's Mansion.
7151460	7154940	I would have been like, oh cool, we're getting 3DS for another year so we can get Wah Luigi's
7154940	7155940	Mansion.
7155940	7156940	Fuck yeah, I'm in.
7156940	7161580	Just Wah Luigi running around shitting himself.
7161580	7162580	Ghost comes out.
7162580	7163580	Wah.
7163580	7165460	He is the ghost.
7165460	7166460	He's haunting people.
7166460	7167460	That's the plot twist.
7167460	7170820	Is it like, Wah Luigi's exploring the mansion trying to figure out.
7170820	7171820	Wah.
7172260	7173260	Who shit the bed.
7173260	7175740	And he's exploring the mansion trying to figure out who shit the bed.
7175740	7177140	And then at the end he realizes.
7177140	7178140	It was him.
7178140	7179620	It was, in fact it was him.
7179620	7184660	So you're suggesting like an It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia plot with Wah Luigi and Wario
7184660	7186780	and.
7186780	7188580	Why wouldn't I suggest that?
7188580	7189580	That's perfect.
7189580	7190580	Calm down.
7190580	7192940	Okay, so there's a little bit more to this email.
7192940	7193940	Alright.
7193940	7199320	On the big violence slash political discussion that ended last week's episode, I will only
7199320	7200320	add one thing.
7200320	7203800	I totally agree with the point that Congress is overwhelmingly made up of crotchety old
7203800	7206520	people who don't understand gaming at all.
7206520	7208400	Only two words can fix this.
7208400	7210080	Term and limit.
7210080	7213720	I wish there was some way this could happen because it's desperately needed.
7213720	7214720	Sigh.
7214720	7217840	And for the record, I'd greatly agree with you.
7217840	7218880	Here's how you do it.
7218880	7220800	You vote for somebody else.
7220800	7222680	Yeah, vote.
7222680	7226440	And you know what I think is amazing, that's pointed out, is that all of these kids that
7226440	7232180	have walked out marching will either, you know, especially the upperclassmen, will be
7232180	7235440	able to vote this year.
7235440	7237520	Or will be able to register to vote this year.
7237520	7240680	And again, I'm going to watch very carefully not to get too political.
7240680	7246360	So please, Jamie, I will say here in this very state, we are watching what's happening
7246360	7248500	with Dianne Feinstein.
7248500	7250080	And she's been in there forever.
7250080	7254000	And there are people, and I have not decided where I'm voting in that yet.
7254000	7256100	I want to hear more about the different positions.
7256100	7260000	But she is facing a real challenge right now from somebody else.
7260000	7264700	And so in some ways, that is almost the term limits thing kind of playing it out.
7264700	7266180	This challenger is another Democrat.
7266180	7270020	It's Kevin de Leon, is his name, he was a former speaker here, is challenging Dianne
7270020	7271020	Feinstein.
7271020	7275060	And when they did the poll at the Democratic convention or whatever, he actually got more
7275060	7276060	votes.
7276060	7277060	It wasn't enough to give him an endorsement.
7277060	7280660	But you're definitely watching this whole, like, some people...
7280660	7282060	The old guard needs to be removed.
7282060	7283060	Yeah.
7283060	7287020	People feel that Dianne Feinstein, you know, thank you for your service, but it's time
7287020	7288020	for somebody else.
7288020	7290620	Again, I don't know where I'm at yet myself.
7290620	7293220	I'm just noticing this is in the news.
7293220	7294740	Yeah.
7294740	7299280	And last but not least, Rob, I noticed that you asked for super multitasking on Switch
7299280	7300280	twice.
7300280	7301280	I sure did.
7301280	7303620	On both last week's episode and the one before it.
7303620	7305740	I'm honored that you would love to have such a thing.
7305740	7311740	But until there is a demonstrated demand for versions that are currently available, I'm
7311740	7313580	sorry to say it's not possible.
7313580	7317060	So if you're listening and you want this thing, please support the game on Steam by playing
7317060	7319160	and especially reviewing it.
7319160	7321580	Thank all of you for your continued support.
7321580	7323500	Okay, back to work on an update.
7323500	7325140	I hope you all have a great week.
7325140	7326140	Have fun.
7326140	7327140	Aaron Yyr.
7327140	7332260	I totally respect Aaron, because I know this thing is a labor of love and all that stuff.
7332260	7334140	And he has stuff going on in his personal life, too.
7334140	7335820	So let me just say, as much as I'm...
7335820	7338940	I'm going to continue to beg and plead for it, and that's just the way it's going to
7338940	7339940	be.
7339940	7341180	I totally respect your reasoning.
7341180	7342180	You're right.
7342180	7350340	Like, if it's not selling like crazy on Steam, as it deserves to be, then why would you take
7350340	7351780	the effort to make a Switch version?
7351780	7354820	So again, y'all should check out Super Multitask.
7354820	7356380	I'm telling you, if you're a streamer, it's fun.
7356380	7358180	Everyone play it at least once, all at the same time.
7358180	7360500	Yeah, and it's a great streaming game.
7360500	7364700	I don't know why this has not caught wildfire on streams.
7364700	7368820	Picking what does and doesn't go viral is so weird to me.
7368820	7371700	I almost wonder if this is one of those games that just isn't going to get discovered for
7371700	7373220	like six months or something.
7373220	7374220	I don't know.
7374220	7375220	We'll see.
7375220	7380580	Um, I was going to say, I wonder, you know, with all the E3 stuff around the corner, I
7380580	7385900	wonder how much money we'd have to give Danny DeVito to cosplay as Detective Pikachu during
7385900	7390380	the Nintendo Direct event that time.
7390380	7391820	Can they give him that kind of money, please?
7391820	7394100	Because I would love to see that.
7394580	7398140	All right, well, never say never, I suppose.
7398140	7399140	All right.
7399140	7400580	Is that it for emails?
7400580	7401580	That's it.
7401580	7402580	Stephanie.
7402580	7403580	All right.
7403580	7407980	Participate at orangelauntrader.com if you want to get in on the emails next week.
7407980	7410420	But for now, we're back to the news with Loki.
7410420	7412260	Ah, yes.
7412260	7416020	So unfortunately, you know, we did talk a little bit about how Toys R Us was going to
7416020	7420100	be closing some of its stores, um, soon.
7420100	7426340	Well, now it's become all of its stores because they're unable to secure a buyer for it.
7426340	7432380	And so unfortunately, they will be closing all of its 735 stores in the US.
7432380	7436060	I believe, though, in Canada, those stores are getting purchased by another company and
7436060	7437420	will stay on as Toys R Us.
7437420	7442220	So Toys R Us still lives on in the great nation of Canada, but just not over here in the United
7442220	7443220	States.
7443220	7450780	So yeah, that's so depressing, because that's like a huge piece of gaming history, a huge
7450780	7455740	piece of my childhood right there just kind of gone away.
7455740	7461180	And I know that a lot of the reason that they haven't done well is because of just other
7461180	7464780	companies, you know, being like, you know, Target or Walmart and stuff like that, having
7464780	7469620	their own toy departments, but I don't know, even those don't have like the breadth of
7469620	7472740	selection that, you know, Toys R Us has.
7473380	7480100	It's not the same. And I guess there's online stuff, but yeah, it's not going to be as fun
7480100	7484660	as going into a store and actually being able to check everything out.
7484660	7489700	I don't think it's online so much as it's Walmart and Target have really put a dent
7489700	7490700	in it.
7490700	7494820	And I think Toys R Us has just been like extremely mismanaged, like they're not paying their
7494820	7499400	employees competitively, so they're not attracting the, you know, level of talent you need.
7499400	7504960	They're not like they're just they're just they're Toys R Us is stuck in the 90s in more
7504960	7509280	ways than when I talk about these fascinating, wow, I went to a Toys R Us today and it's
7509280	7511600	still stuck in like the 1990s.
7511600	7517040	That's not necessarily a compliment like and that's the same thing that I felt about Kmart.
7517040	7520080	And now those are like all at least in this area, they're like completely gone in this
7520080	7521080	area.
7521080	7523120	And there's one like in Auburn, maybe.
7523120	7525560	Yeah, it's probably another time machine up there.
7526080	7532120	Well, the thing that really just grinds me over this one is that the the CEO and upper
7532120	7537800	management are making it out with all of this bonus money that they've been approved to
7537800	7543200	receive yet long term full time employees are getting zero severance and no extension
7543200	7544560	of benefits.
7544560	7546880	Bobby Blackwell also points this out about Toys R Us.
7546880	7550340	I know he talked about that a little bit on his show about this, but Bain Capital and
7550340	7554860	two other partners bought Toys R Us for six point six billion, but borrowed five point
7554860	7558820	three billion of it and stuck it on Toys R Us debt they had to pay down and they can
7558820	7559820	never pay it down.
7559820	7562640	Toys R Us was in the black when they got bought.
7562640	7566980	So basically these investors purchased it up, stuck the debt on the company and never
7566980	7568380	recovered.
7568380	7569940	So shitty.
7569940	7573660	So why are these people getting the huge dollar payouts?
7573660	7576020	Because the government's letting him do it.
7576020	7578420	Who's in charge of the government right now?
7578980	7579980	Corporations?
7579980	7580980	Pretty much.
7580980	7581980	We are.
7581980	7582980	Look out.
7582980	7583980	We'll take it back.
7583980	7585220	They're supposed to work for us.
7585220	7590560	So speaking of blasts from the past, since we're talking about Toys R Us, guess what's
7590560	7594300	planning to return maybe since Toys R Us is going away?
7594300	7595300	KB Toys.
7595300	7596300	Really?
7596300	7597300	OK.
7597300	7598300	Awesome.
7598300	7603340	So KB Toys, which used to be like the toy store that was in every single mall.
7603340	7604340	Sure.
7604340	7605660	Might be coming back.
7605660	7607300	So that's kind of interesting.
7608180	7613140	Basically there's a company, Strategic Brands LLC, they said that they were going to save
7613140	7619220	the toy industry and basically their plans to resurrect KB Toys.
7619220	7620220	So well, that's good.
7620220	7621980	The malls could use something because they could.
7621980	7625740	I'm worried the malls are going to be the next thing to go in many places.
7625740	7626740	Some of these malls around here.
7626740	7627740	Yeah.
7627740	7628740	Yeah.
7628740	7630100	Like I don't how is Sunrise still in business?
7630100	7631100	Jesus.
7631100	7632100	I don't know.
7632100	7633220	But then what are they going to do?
7633220	7634720	That's a huge chunk of land.
7634720	7635720	Like what do you do with it?
7636140	7637440	Turn to a shopping center.
7637440	7638440	Oh yeah.
7638440	7640440	Build a sports arena.
7640440	7641440	Yeah.
7641440	7644160	But it's a local joke.
7644160	7645160	Sacramento joke.
7645160	7646160	No.
7646160	7647720	They could build like a shopping center or something.
7647720	7652100	That's what they did with like the Birdcage member and Birdcage is a pretty awesome shopping
7652100	7653100	center.
7653100	7658280	They got rid of it for like, you know, Best Buy.
7658280	7659720	Kids of Sacramento, pull up a chair.
7659720	7661080	I'm going to get local here for a minute.
7661080	7664400	The rest of y'all just hear me out here because you probably had a place like this in your
7664400	7665400	town.
7666080	7669220	They have this awesome little outdoor shopping mall here called the Birdcage.
7669220	7673240	It does still exist, but they basically bulldoze the old one completely and built a new one
7673240	7674300	from the ground up.
7674300	7678480	So the old one was awesome because it had a dollar theater that showed Rocky Horror
7678480	7680460	Picture Show at midnight for years and years.
7680460	7682320	That's where I first started to go to it.
7682320	7684800	It had a bowling alley, which was rad.
7684800	7687360	It also had an arcade for the longest time.
7687360	7689080	And it was like the game room, the game room.
7689080	7692200	And it was like the fucking arcade.
7692200	7694920	Like that is where the competitive street fighter, Dan took me.
7694920	7695920	That was everything.
7695920	7697800	And that's when they added like the game room spin.
7697800	7700800	They had a spin off of it in Folsom, too, that we did a tournament out.
7700800	7701800	We did.
7701800	7702800	Yeah.
7702800	7703800	That was actually, I think, where they moved the Birdcage one to.
7703800	7704800	They did.
7704800	7705800	Yeah.
7705800	7706800	That was.
7706800	7707800	It wasn't necessarily a spin off.
7707800	7708800	So it was like cheaper rent in Folsom.
7708800	7709800	I thought they were both open at the same time because I swear.
7709800	7711480	For a very brief period of time.
7711480	7712480	Yeah.
7712480	7713480	So anyway.
7713480	7716440	But long story short, they bulldozed the theaters.
7716440	7719080	The parking lot became a Best Buy.
7719080	7722160	The fucking old bowling alley is like a shoe store now.
7722160	7723160	It's all gone.
7723160	7724280	All the good stuff's gone.
7724280	7725660	This is sad.
7725660	7727080	You know what else the Birdcage had?
7727080	7728080	Montgomery Ward.
7728080	7729080	Did it?
7729080	7730080	Yeah.
7730080	7731840	That's where the target is now.
7731840	7736480	I was Montgomery Ward's back in the day when the the Walmart on Arden was a Montgomery
7736480	7737480	Ward as well.
7737480	7738480	Yeah.
7738480	7741220	And he still has the escalator in it with the buggy escalator.
7741220	7742760	Actually the Walmart on Arden.
7742760	7744080	I don't know.
7744080	7745480	You mean Watt and El Camino.
7745480	7746480	Yeah.
7746480	7747480	It's gone.
7747480	7748600	They close that Walmart's gone.
7748600	7749600	Is it?
7749600	7751940	It is closed because the Sam's went under.
7751940	7754300	And that is one of the very few Walmarts there that close.
7754300	7757060	But that Walmart was trash.
7757060	7758060	That Walmart was trash.
7758060	7761300	It was a diseased asshole of a wall rash.
7761300	7764860	Like the only reason you would go to that Walmart is that cool elevator with the shopping
7764860	7765860	cart.
7765860	7766860	So you can put in the elevator.
7766860	7767860	Which was there in the Montgomery Ward.
7767860	7768860	Yes.
7768860	7769860	So later, you mean?
7769860	7770860	Yeah.
7770860	7771860	That's not sorry.
7771860	7772860	The escalator.
7772860	7773860	Otherwise that that was like rash.
7773860	7774860	But now they have a scary.
7774860	7776940	But the new Winco across the street is pretty cool.
7776940	7779440	And they are building a new movie theater.
7779440	7781440	It's one of the it's the studio movie girl.
7781440	7782440	People are opening it.
7782440	7783440	That's awesome.
7783440	7789960	It's going in where the Macy's used to be across the street.
7789960	7795240	Anyway, there's your local news from Sacramento's number two gaming podcast.
7795240	7796240	No.
7796240	7802240	We are second to none.
7802240	7805100	But yeah, they've speaking of the KB Toys thing.
7805100	7811540	So getting back to that, they've already started kind of putting the groundwork in
7811540	7812540	there.
7812540	7817360	They have open invitations, I guess, to people to join up.
7817360	7822900	And they've even registered the main KB Toys stores or toys store.
7822900	7824900	So interesting.
7824900	7828120	It'll be neat to see something happen.
7828120	7829940	We do need something to fill the void, I think.
7829940	7834100	I is sad that someone's not going to come in and just buy them up.
7834100	7835100	I don't know if it's possible.
7835100	7839580	They could just let the whole company go down and then bring back a new company under the
7839580	7840580	name Toys R Us.
7840580	7841580	So they own the debt or something.
7841580	7842580	But they probably can't do that.
7842580	7844340	I'm trying to think of that's happened before, though.
7844340	7849100	I feel like that's happened that like another company did that, like liquidate everything
7849100	7852500	and just start from I circuit cities coming back.
7852500	7853500	I heard that, too.
7853500	7854500	Yeah.
7854500	7856540	And that would be an example of something like that, too.
7856540	7860700	You know, but anyway, we'll see what happens.
7860700	7861860	I would think, though, with toys.
7861860	7863940	I mean, yes, I know online is a big component.
7863940	7865980	But like, you know, toys are meant to be played with.
7865980	7870580	And I think there's something about getting to play with toys to see what it is that you
7870580	7871580	get.
7871580	7874580	The reason online, I think, is so popular, too, is you go into these places like Wal-Mart
7874580	7875580	and Target.
7875580	7876580	They don't have everything there.
7876580	7877580	Yeah.
7877580	7880180	Like you go like looking for something like, for example, I look for Legos a lot of times
7880180	7883100	and I can't find what I'm looking for in the store.
7883100	7886760	I have to go to like Toys R Us or something like Toys R Us is a lot of times they charge
7886760	7888180	over retail for things.
7888180	7892780	So that's another problem that they had.
7892780	7897340	It's just it is going to be online for a lot of because people get pushed to online
7897340	7902220	because it's just easier, because the pricing is more competitive and it's just more available.
7902220	7908240	All right, well, let's move on to talking about Xbox avatars.
7908240	7909240	That's right.
7909240	7912900	You may remember this was actually announced at last E3, but Microsoft is finally getting
7912900	7914580	around to some new Xbox avatars.
7914580	7917740	They're going to be coming out in April for everybody.
7917740	7921120	But you get a little bit early if you're an Xbox insider.
7921120	7923920	And then in May, there's going to be a brand new avatar filled stores.
7923920	7926280	So lots new props and clothing.
7926280	7929760	I guess you're going to be able to like ride a unicorn and shit, which actually is really
7929760	7930760	cool.
7930760	7933000	So that's all stuff that's going to be coming out of the new avatars.
7933000	7936140	But I think it's also important to point out that like the new avatars that are coming
7936140	7942000	out, there's going to be really, really detailed customization and there's going to be more
7942000	7947280	like diversity, meaning you can have a avatar in a wheelchair.
7947280	7949720	You can have an avatar of the prosthetic limb.
7949720	7953080	You can have a pregnant woman avatar if you want.
7953080	7958220	So they are definitely thinking about what can we do besides just like generic dude and
7958220	7959440	generic girl?
7959440	7962200	Like what are some other body types?
7962200	7967760	Yeah, I wish Nintendo would do that with the Miis because the Miis, they were neat at first,
7967760	7969560	but it's kind of just, it's worn.
7969560	7970560	It's welcome.
7970560	7971560	Yeah.
7971560	7972560	They're very dated at this point.
7972560	7973560	So like do something like this.
7973560	7974560	It'd be pretty awesome.
7974560	7975560	Yeah.
7975560	7976560	Well, kudos to Microsoft.
7976560	7977560	I'm excited to check it out.
7977560	7981080	It's really cool that they are definitely including more people by, you know, just thinking
7981080	7987240	about different body types than just, you know, again, generic dude and generic girl.
7987240	7993560	So and if I remember right, is Microsoft the one where all the clothes went genderless?
7993560	7999240	So if you want to be a male body type, but wear female clothes, whatever, like it wasn't
7999240	8000240	micro.
8000240	8001240	Didn't Microsoft do that?
8001240	8002240	Am I crazy?
8002240	8004120	I thought I remember hearing something about that where they removed the gender restriction
8004120	8008760	on all the clothes, which you know what, y'all?
8008760	8011040	It's that this is the world we live in now.
8011040	8015680	So all right, let's move on to our soccer.
8015680	8017680	You got something else for us?
8017680	8020160	Yeah, I do.
8020160	8021360	I know.
8021360	8025000	And from what I understand, there was that big, massive discussion last week, but I'm
8025000	8030040	going to bring it up because yet another study has come out saying that video games do not
8030040	8031040	make kids violent.
8031040	8041480	And this one, I actually stopped and read the study, but it was there was basically
8041480	8042600	a series of them.
8042600	8049040	There's one from molecular psychology that spoke of German researchers that had three
8049040	8053920	groups of typically non-gaming healthy volunteers, 77 in total, for the study.
8053920	8058320	Each group was given questionnaires and personality assessments right at the start.
8058320	8063680	And then for the next two months, one group was told to play 30 minutes of GTA 5 and another
8063680	8065520	one played Sims 3.
8065520	8070280	The third group, as a control, got told to come back two months later for a second round
8070280	8072740	of identical tests.
8072740	8075000	And the other two groups did the same thing.
8075000	8077760	So basically your third group is your control group.
8077760	8082960	So after the study, they said that they did not find any relevant negative effects in
8082960	8085440	response to violent video games.
8085440	8092060	In fact, the only three tests of the 208 statistical tests performed showed significant interaction
8092060	8097320	pattern that would be in line with this hypothesis, since at least 10 significant effects would
8097320	8099780	be expected purely by chance.
8099780	8104760	We concluded there were no detrimental effects of video game, of video game play.
8104760	8106600	And that's the quote.
8106600	8112800	So again, people got a tree trunk up their ass and are looking for a scapegoat.
8112800	8113800	Stop!
8113800	8114800	It's so cute.
8114800	8117480	You think politicians are going to listen to facts and science?
8117480	8118480	No one.
8118480	8119480	They don't.
8119480	8122280	They make up their own facts and science.
8122280	8125120	Just stop.
8125120	8126120	It's fine.
8126120	8127120	Vote them out.
8127120	8131800	It won't get any traction because people, they let them have their comments and stuff,
8131800	8132800	but it's just...
8132800	8134720	Here's another thing that I think is very beneficial.
8134720	8139000	Here's the situation we're in now that we weren't in in the 90s.
8139000	8141080	Here's the situation we're in now.
8141080	8145720	Most people, like pretty much anybody mid 40s or younger, and then some, and certainly
8145720	8150060	if you are older than your mid 40s, this might apply to you as well, but just about everybody
8150060	8152800	under 40 grew up with video games.
8152800	8153800	You know what I mean?
8153800	8157280	Video games have been a part of our culture because we all fucking grew up on Super Mario
8157280	8158280	Brothers.
8158280	8163240	And all the more reason why we need younger people in these political offices because
8163240	8166320	I think a lot of people don't get it.
8166320	8170400	It's things that they're voting on and stuff that they really don't get, like net neutrality.
8170400	8175240	They don't fucking understand what that is or video games and violence is that they don't
8175240	8182320	understand or care because they're getting paid not to care about these issues and that's
8182320	8183320	a problem.
8183320	8186200	We need more intelligent people in these positions.
8186200	8187640	I'll fucking say it.
8187640	8189300	I'm a fucking say it.
8189300	8192360	Baby boomers need to stop running the country.
8192360	8196960	They just all need to stop period.
8197000	8198000	You know what?
8198000	8201800	Although I will say a better solution would be for all of us to work together, but it
8201800	8206440	needs to not just be one generation and need to actually do something.
8206440	8210560	Don't just go, Oh, I'm not going to vote cause it doesn't do anything.
8210560	8211560	Me.
8211560	8213560	Well then you don't have the ability to complain about it.
8213560	8219240	We'll just form the new political party of the Waluigi, the Waluigi party where our stance,
8219240	8223000	the color purple is available, where you have the, we're, you know, we're purple States
8223000	8227840	and you know, and, and then that way we'll just, you know, if someone's saying something
8227840	8232360	stupid, you just respond back to him.
8232360	8234360	Exactly.
8234360	8237840	Perfect.
8237840	8245800	Video games cause violence and you just a few more stories for you guys.
8245800	8248840	Then we're going to get to the Skype line, which, you know, hopefully somebody still
8248840	8249840	out there.
8249840	8251280	Uh, Loki.
8251280	8258160	So the team behind, uh, the capital wasteland project, which is basically a mod to import
8258160	8264640	fallout three inside the fallout four engine has been canceled because of some conversations
8264640	8269200	that they had with Bethesda regarding some of the legality of the project.
8269200	8275680	So what the main concern was is they were looking to use some of the, um, audio, well,
8275680	8279640	the audio from the game because they didn't want to recreate it because they felt it would
8279640	8284880	lose some of the impact because, you know, they had really big names in the original
8284880	8285880	game.
8285880	8288580	Um, you know, Liam Neeson, Malcolm McDonald, that type of stuff.
8288580	8292640	So they decided that because they weren't able to do that and it was kind of what they
8292640	8297280	were doing is sketchy as hell to basically just continue working on this project to import
8297280	8298600	the game into the engine.
8298600	8303960	So it's unfortunate they said they wouldn't, you know, have you decided to rerecord the
8303960	8304960	audio?
8304960	8306360	I mean, that would have been 90,000 lines of dialogue.
8306360	8315960	So that's a lot, um, that's too bad, but maybe they'll give Bethesda an excuse to rerelease
8315960	8319680	the game in the fallout four engine or something like that.
8319680	8323000	So it would have been cool to see that.
8323000	8327440	I guess it makes sense though, that the voice acting kind of gets into a, you know, they
8327440	8330960	deserve to get paid their residuals and all that, especially when you have fine with it
8330960	8332220	up to that point.
8332220	8335200	But then, you know, once you start getting into that, it's like, that might be licensed
8335200	8339520	differently and it's like, eh, can't really do that.
8339520	8340520	All right.
8340520	8345400	Well, and lastly tonight, a story about Tomb Raider to bring it full circle, but this isn't
8345400	8346640	about the movie.
8346640	8350040	It's about the original games, the original games.
8350040	8351040	That's right.
8351040	8354720	The Tomb Raider trilogy remasters are on their way to PC.
8354720	8358120	Here's the thing though, is that the Tomb Raider games, they are on steam, but I guess
8358120	8360120	it's just through like emulation and stuff.
8360120	8363260	They're not the greatest, uh, translations in the world.
8363260	8366340	So there are remasters coming for the three games.
8366340	8370200	And if you did buy the old games on steam, you'll be able to get these for free.
8370200	8371200	So that's pretty cool.
8371200	8373820	Uh, a company named Realtek VR put these together.
8373820	8379580	It will run at 10 ADP and 60 frames a second, but, and of course there's a catch here.
8379580	8381580	This is Square Enix, right?
8381580	8385580	These remasters, they're based on the mobile versions of the game.
8385580	8387580	Oh fuck them.
8387580	8388580	Seriously.
8388580	8389580	Oh fuck them.
8389580	8392220	Right to hell.
8392220	8393220	And we'll just leave it at that.
8393220	8395640	Let's just not, let's just put new effort into it.
8395640	8396640	Fuck this.
8396640	8398060	We'll make some more money.
8398060	8401860	No, fuck them in their fucking mobile ports.
8401860	8403500	Fuck them in their mobile port.
8403500	8405700	All right.
8405700	8406700	You know what?
8406700	8408020	We do have to have a fuse though, Rob.
8408020	8409020	Oh, that's right.
8409020	8410020	Cause you need to get, well, you know what?
8410020	8411880	And I don't even know if we're going to be able to get calls tonight.
8411880	8415900	I am going to say Skype line is open orange launch radio, all one word on Skype.
8415900	8419320	If you want to get through, it may be a way for you to actually hear the show is by being
8419320	8420320	on it.
8420320	8422080	But meantime, dark soccer says, you know what?
8422080	8423680	I got something I need to get off my chair.
8423680	8425600	I got something to say.
8425600	8430480	So we have to get to some FUs of the week tonight, which, uh, I, Oh my God, I don't
8430480	8431480	have the music.
8431480	8432480	We haven't done it in so long.
8432480	8433480	That's okay.
8433480	8434480	I'll just say it.
8434480	8435480	Here, here, you know what?
8435480	8439400	You can have, since this character's come up a lot tonight, we'll do, uh, we'll do this
8439400	8440520	for the FUs of the week.
8440520	8441520	If it will.
8441520	8442520	Oh God.
8442520	8443520	Don't do this to me.
8443520	8450000	There you go.
8450000	8455600	Fuck those shady bitches for not putting Shangela against Trixie.
8455600	8459000	No, no, I would know you are not allowed to do that.
8459000	8460720	That is the producer's fault.
8460720	8462160	Those Queens are not at fault.
8462160	8464120	The producers, the ones that take the heat for that.
8464120	8465120	I disagree.
8465120	8466120	I disagree.
8466120	8467120	Importantly.
8467120	8471680	You are not, you should not be putting blame on the, because I think that it wasn't them.
8471680	8472680	I don't think it was the producers.
8472840	8476240	The producers made them do it.
8476240	8477240	Where has it said that?
8477240	8479720	They should not have had that jury vote in the first place.
8479720	8480720	That's my point.
8480720	8482320	But ultimately it was their decision.
8482320	8484720	The producers put them to it, but they made the decisions.
8484720	8488160	I anybody who attacks one of those Queens, I will fight you.
8488160	8489680	I'm not attacking them.
8489680	8493400	I'm just saying that it was really shady.
8493400	8494400	I will say this.
8494400	8496240	I will say this in a, in a nice, calm manner.
8496240	8502600	Aja has come out and said since then that she regrets like now that she's seen what
8502600	8503600	we've all seen.
8503600	8509080	She says in the moment it was a lot different than it is on TV.
8509080	8513120	But I still think that it should have been Shangela and Trixie.
8513120	8515920	And as I said on my Facebook, I'm not angry at the winner.
8515920	8519240	I'm angry at the process that, that put her there.
8519240	8520240	Make sense?
8520240	8521240	Yes.
8521240	8524040	And, but Shangela was the big front runner.
8524040	8527840	I think even RuPaul looked absolutely floored by it.
8527840	8532800	I mean, did it, was it just me or was it like this long, longing look as Shangela walked
8532800	8535400	to the back, Rob?
8535400	8537120	Yes.
8537120	8543680	But I will say in Shangela's favor, she took it like the class act she is.
8543680	8545680	Stood there and cheered her sisters on.
8545680	8547080	She's going to have a huge career.
8547080	8548080	They all will.
8548080	8549600	Kennedy's here on Thursday, by the way.
8549600	8552760	I'm considering going to that.
8552760	8560640	But I just want to say that, you know, that is the way that you, you take the step back
8560640	8561980	with grace.
8561980	8564100	And so, well done.
8564100	8566800	And congratulations to Trixie on a win.
8566800	8568040	Trixie is a great queen.
8568040	8569160	Trixie deserved it.
8569160	8571840	You know, if Shangela hadn't been there.
8571840	8572840	All right.
8572840	8576600	I, it's only fair to check in with Logie at FUs of the Week.
8576600	8577600	No.
8577600	8578600	No.
8578600	8580720	I don't have anything so far.
8580720	8586840	And my FU of the Week goes to, um, just the fact that tomorrow's Monday and I have a short
8586840	8590680	week, which is a good thing, but I got to get through the week to get there.
8590680	8592160	All right.
8592160	8593720	We're going to turn our attention to the Skyline.
8593720	8594720	I'm sorry.
8594720	8597680	I've seen some calls coming in and I missed them because I wanted to, I wanted Jamie to
8597680	8601320	get her appropriate rant out of her system.
8601320	8604800	We wouldn't want that to bottle up over three weeks, but I do believe I see a call coming
8604800	8605800	in.
8605800	8606800	So let's get to it.
8606800	8607800	Hi.
8607800	8608800	You are on Orange Knowledge Radio.
8608800	8609800	Who's this?
8609880	8610880	Hey, everybody.
8610880	8611880	It's Ronma.
8611880	8612880	Hey, Ronma.
8612880	8613880	What's up, buddy?
8613880	8614880	Not much, Rob.
8614880	8615880	Sit down.
8615880	8616880	Let's get some coffee.
8616880	8617880	We need to talk.
8617880	8618880	You're in luck.
8618880	8619880	I'm sitting.
8619880	8620880	Do it, coffee.
8620880	8621880	Will you give us a topic?
8621880	8622880	Yes.
8622880	8623880	Rhode Island.
8623880	8624880	It's neither a road or an island.
8624880	8625880	Discuss.
8625880	8627800	But it's a very nice time of the year to visit.
8627800	8628800	It is.
8628800	8629800	No.
8629800	8638320	Um, the whole talk of Toys R Us going away, the return of KB Toys.
8638320	8646160	This is not a follow up to my discussion from last week, but it's more like the stores
8646160	8648080	that we used to go to as a kid.
8648080	8650720	I mean, you mentioned Montgomery Wards.
8650720	8655960	I mean, I don't remember one in my neck of the woods, but we had consumers and that's
8655960	8658640	where I bought all of my frickin' video games from.
8658640	8660520	I bought Killer Instinct at Montgomery Ward.
8660520	8661520	You know what?
8661520	8663840	You know what this boils down to, Ronma?
8663840	8664840	Getting old sucks.
8664840	8667640	Who are you trying to kid?
8667640	8672280	Getting old sucks because you know what, someday there's going to be, you know, some
8672280	8677440	of the kids today, there's going to be some 18 year old listening to this show who when,
8677440	8682700	you know, he or she gets to be 40 years old, the conversation is going to be like, remember
8682700	8686040	when people used to go to gas stations?
8686040	8689040	Remember when gas station, remember when cars ran on gas?
8689040	8691040	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
8691040	8694160	Back to the future too.
8694160	8697400	Remember when we had to lace our shoes?
8697400	8700800	Remember when we used to use hands to play video games?
8700800	8705800	Remember when cars didn't fly?
8705800	8709600	So I mean, that's, that's the thing, Ronma, it's just, it's just getting old sucks.
8709600	8713260	Like the stuff that used to be, and I'm sure, I'm sure there's stuff our parents would talk
8713260	8716360	about that, you know, we never heard of.
8716360	8717760	I'm trying to think of like stores that were-
8717760	8718760	A party line.
8718760	8719760	A lot, oh.
8719760	8722760	I know, we had party lines and the extra long phone cable, remember?
8722760	8724760	We did have party lines, but they were-
8725760	8729760	You'd get the extra long phone cable and hide in the bathroom so no one could hear you trust your friends.
8729760	8732760	I do, remember, remember cordless phones?
8732760	8733760	Who remembers when the-
8733760	8737760	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, they still sell them.
8737760	8739760	Remember when the police were like outside my door?
8739760	8741760	What is, are we getting swatted?
8741760	8742760	Rotary phones.
8742760	8743760	Jesus Christ, hold on.
8743760	8744760	I want to see what's happening outside.
8744760	8745760	Can you guys have a call?
8745760	8746760	Okay.
8746760	8749760	Well, what other things do we remember from when we were kids?
8749760	8754760	I remember the Fairchild Channel F and how much the controller blew.
8754760	8757760	Jamie, when did Rob become such a nosy little bitch?
8757760	8761760	Well, it is quite literally like right outside the door, it's really loud.
8761760	8763760	Fair enough, fair enough, fair enough.
8763760	8766760	Yeah, and Rob is a concerned neighbor.
8766760	8771760	It is not, they went by, I actually think, you know how there's like the big street,
8771760	8774760	like two streets, I think they were pulled over there.
8774760	8775760	Gotcha.
8775760	8776760	So it's nothing.
8776760	8777760	But it was at least a couple of cars.
8777760	8778760	Yeah, you could, dang, you could hear that though.
8778760	8780760	Sorry, just live radio.
8780760	8783760	If it's not the stream cutting out, it's the police showing up.
8783760	8787760	What can you do?
8787760	8788760	Here's one.
8788760	8790760	Remember Radio Shack?
8790760	8795760	Sorry, I'm loving some of these comments in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.
8795760	8800760	Kossin in chat says, we'll mention stuff and kids will be like, what the hell is Hollywood video?
8800760	8802760	Tigerclaw says, remember beepers?
8802760	8807760	Bobby Blackwell says, remember when you had to pull your phone out of your pocket to look something up?
8807760	8813760	You know what, no, I remember, it was on one of those like Buzzfeed things too,
8813760	8818760	but like someone had said like, my kid just asked me why we say hang up the phone.
8818760	8824760	Bobby Blackwell says, remember when you could listen to a radio stream and not have it cut out every 20 seconds?
8824760	8825760	No.
8825760	8827760	Canceled, this show is canceled.
8827760	8830760	Fuck that comment, good night.
8830760	8833760	Remember when people could just pass all the demos that they played?
8833760	8836760	Remember when the snozzberries tasted like snozzberries?
8836760	8839760	I remember, you remember? I remember.
8839760	8841760	Ted Bridge Farm remembers.
8841760	8846760	Anyway, sorry Rama, was there something else you were trying to get across?
8846760	8849760	It's all good tonight, it's all good tonight, you know?
8849760	8850760	It is all good.
8850760	8855760	We're talking about stuff from our childhood that we're probably not going to see again.
8855760	8858760	I would love to see Toys R Us make a comeback.
8858760	8863760	I mean, there is, we got KB that's coming back, I saw the press release for that.
8864760	8867760	Circuit City is making a comeback, you know?
8869760	8875760	It's like I said, it's gotten to the point where the big box stores aren't cutting it anymore.
8875760	8879760	These little specialty stores is where the money is at now.
8879760	8889760	I'd like to see Toys R Us come back as a small, not a boutique, but like a basic store, two or three floors, basic selection of stuff.
8890760	8896760	Yeah, you know, there was a tiny Toys R Us, you know what the full smell is? They have like a small Toys R Us.
8896760	8900760	It was a clear out store, but it's not there anymore.
8900760	8904760	Actually, it was there two weeks ago when Dan and I went.
8904760	8905760	Really?
8905760	8908760	And they had apparently just really expensive stuff in there.
8908760	8910760	Guess what, y'all, it wasn't there last time.
8910760	8912760	It ain't going to be there much longer.
8912760	8914760	Actually, or it might because they're clearing out everything.
8914760	8917760	Yeah, maybe. But anyway, I just think of that store because it's actually really small.
8917760	8921760	I believe, ironically, it was a KB Toys when those outlets first opened.
8921760	8922760	Yes, it was.
8923760	8931760	The main thing I remember about KB Toys is because it was like one of the places I could buy Master System games brand new for like ten bucks.
8931760	8935760	I always remember KB Toys being fucking thrashed every time I went in there.
8935760	8936760	Oh, I remember.
8936760	8937760	It was just destroyed.
8937760	8940760	I remember the bin full of Atari 2600 games.
8940760	8943760	I remember getting all this stuff there.
8943760	8946760	We went to a KB once, like right before they closed down.
8946760	8952760	And we went through every stack of their PlayStations until we found the one that still had the IO port on it.
8952760	8957760	Because our PlayStation, we had to put it tilted sideways to get it to play right.
8957760	8961760	So we got the last of the IO ports that that one carried.
8961760	8962760	Nice.
8962760	8966760	Out of like 50 that we checked the serial number on, we got one.
8966760	8972760	Azet in chat says, this might be a local thing, but who remembers wishing well?
8972760	8973760	I'm not wishing well.
8973760	8974760	There's still one around.
8974760	8976760	There's what? There's still a wishing well?
8976760	8977760	I think so.
8977760	8980760	Not the one over by Madison.
8980760	8981760	No, that's gone.
8981760	8984760	By strings and by the bowling alley.
8984760	8986760	Yeah, that one's still there?
8986760	8989760	I don't know. I haven't been there since I haven't been to the gym there.
8989760	8992760	No, I'm pretty sure that wishing well is long gone.
8992760	8995760	Wishing well is basically Party City, but it was cooler.
8995760	8998760	Because they had the giant bins of like party favors.
8998760	9000760	That was the coolest part of wishing well.
9000760	9002760	I think that was a local chain, though.
9002760	9004760	I don't think wishing well existed really outside NorCal.
9004760	9007760	That sounds kind of familiar, but I'm not too sure.
9007760	9014760	Because I mentioned in the chat earlier, I remember as a kid seeing commercials for a chain called Lionel Kitty City,
9014760	9016760	and the mascot was a kangaroo.
9016760	9020760	And I'm probably the only person that remembers that.
9020760	9024760	And I think that might have also been a local chain or something, you know?
9024760	9027760	It's interesting to me how everything that's successful now is a national chain.
9028760	9030760	That's what's disappearing is local shit.
9030760	9032760	It's disappearing big time.
9032760	9034760	With few exceptions.
9034760	9039760	Sorry, East Coast. In-N-Out Burger just doesn't want to be a thing, I guess.
9039760	9043760	Wait, hold on. In-N-Out Burger is now available in the Midwest.
9043760	9047760	Texas, right? Has it gone further than that?
9047760	9049760	Colorado.
9049760	9051760	Oh, it's still pretty west.
9052760	9054760	It's still Midwest. It still means it's closer to me.
9054760	9059760	And I have friends in Colorado who have been trying to get me to come out there and visit again.
9059760	9062760	Fair enough. We don't have Waffle House, so it happens.
9062760	9065760	Well, people should be bringing me some grits.
9065760	9070760	But we are getting a Cracker Barrel, but that place is overrated as fuck.
9072760	9074760	I do like the fried catfish.
9075760	9087760	But anyway, there are, though, in Berkeley, there were a few mom and pop toy stores that had educational toys and old style wooden toys and things like that.
9087760	9089760	And I thought that was really cool.
9089760	9096760	They still have those. There's a big one by us in the Nimbus Winery, which is not really a winery. It's just an indoor mall thing.
9096760	9097760	Shopping center, yeah.
9097760	9101760	They've got one that's got a bunch of toys and all the educational stuff.
9101760	9102760	Oh, yeah.
9103760	9106760	They still have the Learning Company over by Mongolia Barbecue in Roseville.
9106760	9107760	Yeah, okay.
9107760	9109760	Yeah. Anyway.
9109760	9112760	All right, well, Rama, anything else besides memory lane you want to talk about tonight?
9113760	9118760	No, not really. I just wanted to talk about that cool stuff.
9118760	9121760	So, the moral of the story is you're old, but so are we.
9121760	9125760	Yeah, and sometimes going old is not really a bad thing.
9125760	9128760	And if you call me an exennial, I will beat your face in.
9129760	9138760	I absolutely hate that term. You are not exennial. You are Generation X. You earned that title and you take that title to your grave.
9138760	9143760	Rama, I don't believe in labels, actually. I don't think you can label me because I'm a special snowflake.
9143760	9146760	And so, I reject your labels.
9146760	9149760	So, I mean, I have to take off the fabulous label as well?
9149760	9151760	Oh, no, that one I'll take.
9151760	9157760	Wait, you said you don't do labels. So, you can't have the fabulous one too.
9157760	9163760	You are not. That's it, sir. That's it, sir. If you are going to bring logic and analysis and facts into this, I'm hanging up on you.
9164760	9166760	I love you, Rama. I fucking love you.
9166760	9168760	Hugs and kisses. Bye.
9168760	9169760	Bye.
9169760	9173760	All right. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.
9175760	9179760	I should cut that out. And that should be the clip of Orange Lounge Radio.
9179760	9183760	Sir, if you're going to bring facts and analysis on this program, you need to leave.
9184760	9187760	That should be every video game podcast.
9191760	9194760	Except Bobby. Bobby's show really is facts.
9194760	9198760	All right. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype if you want to get through.
9198760	9201760	I'm assuming the stream is operational right now. I have no idea.
9201760	9204760	Any last minute stories from anyone here in the studio?
9204760	9205760	No.
9205760	9207760	No? All right.
9207760	9208760	I ain't got shit.
9208760	9213760	Well, quickly, since we are going to be on a break for the live folks anyway, we'll be on a break for three weeks.
9213760	9216760	Any games you're looking forward to playing in the next two weeks?
9219760	9220760	No.
9220760	9223760	Loki, how is there no Ready Player One game?
9224760	9226760	They have like some VR experiences and stuff.
9226760	9236760	The reason that I don't think there's a Ready Player One game per se is that, you know, with much like the licensing that they had to do for the movie,
9236760	9240760	they'd have to do that type of licensing for a game and good luck with that.
9240760	9243760	So we're talking about things that are long gone.
9243760	9246760	SGA 100 Matt mentioned something about Orange County.
9246760	9249760	But when I first read that, I thought it said Orange Julius.
9249760	9252760	I don't know if that was just like my mall brain taking over.
9252760	9254760	Is Orange Julius still a thing?
9254760	9255760	Yes.
9255760	9256760	Are they really?
9256760	9257760	It's DQ and Orange Julius are together.
9257760	9258760	Oh.
9258760	9260760	So if I go to Dairy Queen, I can get Orange Julius.
9260760	9263760	I don't know about that, but I know that they have one.
9263760	9265760	I know the Galleria has one because I always get Orange Julius there.
9265760	9266760	Really?
9266760	9268760	They still have one at Sunrise Mall.
9268760	9270760	Oh, well I never go there.
9270760	9272760	So, but yeah, they're around.
9272760	9273760	Unless I go to Red Robin.
9273760	9277760	So they've got, yeah, I always get Orange Julius. I fucking love that shit.
9278760	9282760	If I find out that they have Orange Julius at the Dairy Queen near me, I'm fucking going there too.
9282760	9284760	So I love that shit.
9285760	9286760	I love it.
9286760	9291760	I know, that's what I'm going to, what are you going to miss the most if malls go under? Orange Julius.
9292760	9293760	Mrs. Fields.
9294760	9297760	Yes. Oh my God. Mrs. Fields and TCBY.
9298760	9303760	You know what though? Keep in mind when I grew up with TCBY, they were always standalone. They weren't inside of a mall.
9303760	9304760	Oh.
9305760	9309760	And I worked at a cookie shop. It was one of my first jobs.
9309760	9314760	Really? See, okay. I know I have to have told this story on OLR before, but I'm going to tell it again.
9314760	9319760	So when I was in college, myself and my roommate who I lived with at the time, who was also a gay guy,
9319760	9324760	we used to have the biggest crush on the guy that worked at Mrs. Fields, who was the cookie boy.
9324760	9326760	So we all called him the cookie boy. He was the cookie boy.
9327760	9333760	And then the cookie boy, but sometimes we would go and we would like, you know, go to get cookies and stuff and we'd go, I'm the cookie boy.
9334760	9340760	And, uh, but then sometimes like we'd look over and he's talking to one of the yogurt gals that worked at the TCBY.
9340760	9343760	I was connected to it. So it was the cookie boy and the yogurt wenches.
9344760	9345760	So sometimes we walk away.
9345760	9347760	Were you creating your own fan fiction in your head?
9347760	9349760	Yes. Yes. We were creating TCBY fan fiction.
9349760	9351760	We were shipping malls.
9351760	9352760	Early shipping.
9352760	9353760	We were shipping.
9356760	9357760	True story.
9357760	9360760	But where will kids go if they can't be dropped off at the mall?
9360760	9367760	A true story. My first job in that mall that I had three different jobs in was working at the cookie place.
9367760	9374760	And then I started working at the arcade next door. It was actually on the other side of the movie theater because we, we sandwiched the movie theater.
9374760	9381760	And I worked there for a long time, moved to cyber station, came back to Aladdin's castle and then got hired at an herb kiosk in the middle of the mall.
9381760	9383760	I worked in that mall for like four years.
9383760	9385760	I missed all those retail adventures.
9385760	9386760	Or three years, something like that.
9386760	9391760	I mean, there's a hot topic in the, the, um, outlet mall that we have, but.
9391760	9392760	And they usually have the sales there too.
9392760	9394760	Where's, where would hot topic go?
9395760	9402760	My, my one and only, my one and only retail job I ever had was I worked for a local video chain called Plaster TV Video.
9402760	9408760	They don't exist anymore, but they were obviously VA chess rental and they didn't get on the DVD bandwagon until way too late.
9408760	9412760	That's what did them in. Um, and also, uh, they rented Nintendo games.
9412760	9416760	They never bothered to upgrade to Super Nintendo or Genesis.
9416760	9419760	They still just would rent the same fucking Nintendo games.
9419760	9424760	And the thing that really kept them in business, all the movies on the top shelf, porn.
9424760	9427760	So we rented, we rented porn.
9427760	9434760	Well, my first retail job here and my only retail job here was GNC until I got held up at gunpoint.
9434760	9436760	Oh yeah. You told me about that. Oh my God.
9436760	9437760	And the funny thing about that night.
9437760	9439760	That was right after I, that was right before I met you.
9439760	9442760	Yeah, but it was also, it was around Christmas.
9442760	9443760	Yeah.
9443760	9444760	And this guy was hitting GNCs.
9444760	9453760	The thing is you don't hold up an artist who has a mostly visual memory because I ended up drawing the guy and drawing his gun.
9453760	9454760	Wow.
9454760	9456760	And they caught him from my drawing.
9456760	9458760	They didn't have video at least?
9458760	9459760	Not in that, they're cheap.
9459760	9462760	It was, it was the one over on trucks next to the Walmart.
9462760	9465760	Well, that must be why they were hitting GNCs because they knew their security.
9465760	9467760	They also hit sunrise mall too.
9467760	9469760	Okay. Even our crappy little video store had video.
9469760	9470760	Oh, I mean.
9470760	9480760	But now thing number two, thing number two, that same night I was of course shaken after the fact Dan took me to Toys R Us at Arden Fair Mall.
9480760	9487760	I found a $20 bill in the dry, in the parking lot and I bought myself my Togepi plushie, my big Togepi pillow.
9487760	9491760	So it's gaming related and related to our stories tonight.
9491760	9496760	So just because a show I will ever associate being held up at gunpoint at GNC with Toys R Us.
9496760	9497760	And Pokemon.
9497760	9500760	And, and Togepi in particular.
9500760	9505760	All right. Well, uh, the skyline isn't lighting up, but I know it's been rough with the live crowd tonight.
9505760	9510760	So again, I really appreciate you guys that stuck with us tonight through the ups and downs of the show.
9510760	9514760	It's a little bit embarrassing, but I also know it's just completely out of our control.
9514760	9520760	But for those of you listening on the podcast or catching up on the podcast as the case may be, thank you for being here.
9520760	9522760	We will be off next week.
9522760	9524760	Believe it or not, it's our first week off all year long.
9524760	9526760	So yeah, I think we earned a week off.
9526760	9528760	So we won't be here.
9528760	9529760	Happy gaming next week.
9529760	9532760	We will be back live in three weeks.
9532760	9536760	We'll be back on the podcast feed in two weeks with a brand new Orange Launch Radio.
9536760	9540760	Stay tuned to our Twitter for all the latest or if you have a quick question you want to ask us.
9540760	9543760	I know I don't always read the tweets on the show, but I watch the Twitter.
9543760	9547760	And if you have a question, I'll answer it as long as it's not, why are you such an asshole?
9547760	9549760	I'm not going to, I don't have an answer for that.
9549760	9552760	So, uh, but if you have questions about schedule or whatever, I can answer those.
9552760	9560760	So as I always say here at Orange Launch Radio, if you enjoyed the show, skips and all, uh, please consider telling a friend or five about the show.
9560760	9565760	Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but, uh, only if the voices are here to like air out there.
9565760	9574760	So, uh, uh, yeah, uh, please help us spread the word and a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play or wherever it is you found this show.
9574760	9576760	Those five star reviews, let me tell you, they go a long way.
9576760	9579760	And I don't even, have we even had a five star review this year on iTunes?
9579760	9582760	I think you should go be the first. Go do it right now at iTunes.
9582760	9584760	Leave a five star review. I'd appreciate it.
9585760	9592760	Uh, that about does it, but not until we get the final, final thoughts leading into this, uh, three week live break. Uh, Loki, your final thought?
9592760	9597760	My final thought is I'm glad to be working on a new game finally and working on a game.
9597760	9602760	So that's, yeah, that's been about it.
9602760	9611760	My final thought is I'm just, I, I am, I continue to be grateful for those of you that stick out these dumb live issues and listen to the show.
9611760	9619760	And just, even if you have no idea that's going on, cause you're a podcast only person, those, you know, we, we heard from an emailer tonight who thanked us for putting out podcasts for so long.
9619760	9625760	Thank you for being here to listen to it. Like, seriously, like I, I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
9625760	9628760	And it's, it's just the motivation for us to keep going week after week.
9628760	9632760	So, I mean, if we're going to be gone for three weeks, that's the note I want to leave on.
9632760	9635760	Uh, Dark Soccer, last but not, ladies last.
9635760	9637760	My cat is better than most humans.
9638760	9639760	Co-signed.
9639760	9640760	Yes.
9640760	9646760	Uh, well, go love your pets, your, uh, kitties and your puppies or your ferrets or whatever kind of pet you have.
9646760	9653760	And, uh, play some video games and we will be back here in 7, 14, 21 days to do it all over again.
9653760	9656760	Have a great night, everybody. Goodbye.
