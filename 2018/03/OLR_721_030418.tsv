27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back, it's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 721 for this, March 4th, 2018. I cannot believe it's March, this year is just flying by.
46000	59000	Anyway, thanks for being with us tonight, whether it be live or on our podcast feed to talk about video games. Myself, Rob Roberts, here in studio, and Seven, based in lovely Sacramento, California, with my co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
59000	61000	They better appreciate what we've given up for them.
61000	62000	What did we give up today?
62000	63000	Trixie
63000	66000	Yeah, a very famous drag queen in town tonight. I was gonna say not that
66000	68000	You better love us for this.
68000	73000	I was gonna say, not that silly award show on TV that I haven't seen for 15 years.
73000	75000	You better love us.
75000	82000	Although the sentimental part of me, because of where we are based, is rooting for Lady Bird a little bit, but all the movies I saw were good.
82000	83000	I want Get Out to win.
83000	85000	All the movies I saw, I didn't see Get Out.
85000	87000	Actually, I want, if either
87000	88000	I've not heard a bad thing about it.
88000	96000	I want, actually, I wouldn't be mad if Lady Bird, Get Out, or The Shape of Water wins. I'm really tied between
96000	98000	It's just a dumb award.
98000	101000	I'm really tied between The Shape of Water and Get Out, though.
101000	107000	And I'd really more push for Get Out because of how important it would be if Get Out wins.
107000	112000	It's just, it's just an award. You know what I mean? Like, I don't know. There's a part of me that's like
112000	126000	There is something for an African-American directed movie about something that black people in general deal with every day to win.
126000	133000	And that would be tremendous. I think the social message to me, even though I love The Shape of Water more as a movie,
133000	138000	I think the social message would be brilliant. And that's my point on it.
138000	143000	Yeah, I do get that, but there's that part of me that's just kind of like, I mean, it's like video game award shows.
143000	148000	It's like, it's just an award. It's what a bunch of stuffy people who aren't me think about movies.
148000	152000	And who cares about their opinion? It's what I think. So, I don't know. That's, you know.
152000	158000	But I get what you're saying. I don't want to invalidate, you know, your point. It is important to get more diversity in Hollywood.
158000	161000	We've known that for a long time. And so, you know, I understand that.
161000	165000	Anyway, I do want to move on, though, and introduce Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki. How are you?
165000	166000	I'm doing okay.
166000	173000	What's new with you? I saw your adventures in DDR machine cleaning yesterday on Twitter. That was interesting.
173000	181000	Well, yeah. I was looking to mod the DDR pads because the right or left side was kind of not that sensitive.
181000	186000	It didn't seem to be working that well. And so, then I figured out that, oh, some of these screws are stripped.
186000	192000	So, I had to fix those. But then I was like, well, wait a second. You know, these are stripped and these are so in there tight.
192000	198000	I'm guessing this is not cleaned at all. And sure enough, you know, I open it up and it's pretty dirty in there.
198000	205000	So, I did my best with a shop vac and scraping dirt out of crevices using a screwdriver.
205000	215000	And it's getting there. It's just, you know, it's taking a long time. Like, I finished one of the sections or one of the arrows.
215000	220000	And like, it took me like an hour or something to do it because it was just so bad.
220000	230000	And then also the little rubber stuff that the actual arrows sit on is like kind of degrading. So, it's all gross looking.
230000	236000	But yeah, it should be much better now that once it's clean, you know, I'm going to mod it and it'll be much more sensitive.
236000	240000	Oh, so you haven't really got to play it since you cleaned it to see if it's better.
240000	249000	Oh, yeah. I've only done one arrow. So, I haven't actually, I haven't, I'm not, you know, I meant to do one side because I've been playing mostly on the right side.
249000	254000	Because the left side, like when I was doing doubles and stuff, the top arrow would miss all the time.
254000	261000	And so, that's what kind of like, well, Jesus, do I have a bad sensor in there? But then like reading up on it, those sensors don't really go bad that easily.
261000	269000	It's more of that either the bracket comes too loose or, you know, something's off on it.
269000	276000	And so, yeah, probably with all the dirt crammed in there, it might be a little hard for that to go, you know, move around in there.
276000	282000	So, once it's all cleaned out, it'll be much better. And then, in the meantime, I can still play on the right side.
282000	291000	Although, I may take tomorrow, like take off from just exercising for a day to try to finish that side and get it done.
291000	298000	But yeah, that's what I've been doing. And then, once, and now, you'll probably, once I finish that, eventually I'm going to countersink everything and get a whole new set of screws.
298000	301000	But right now, it's just kind of fixing what I have.
301000	305000	Missed opportunity for videoing this whole process. There's a market on YouTube for that.
305000	309000	Oh, there's still tons of stuff that clean up. I haven't even done the other side yet, but I don't know.
309000	314000	That's actually, you know, funny enough, that's where I kind of saw the information.
314000	323000	There's a guy on YouTube that, he did like a three-part series on cleaning and modding your DDR pads.
323000	328000	So, like, except his, you know, were already clean. And like, his are like immaculate.
328000	332000	It's just, I wish mine looked like that. I don't think I'm ever going to get it that clean.
332000	343000	But, you know, it was really dirty. Like, I've, even like wiping down the bottoms of the arrows and stuff, it's just like black.
343000	348000	I do want to go to our chat room because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.
348000	353000	Right after the Bobby Black will show at the voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
353000	357000	And some folks talking about movies because of other things going on in the world tonight.
357000	361000	But, I do, we do have a related comment to what you're talking about, Logie.
361000	367000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, there's a market on YouTube. No, there's not. They demonetized us. Frown face.
367000	372000	That's right. Thank you for the reminder. Fuck YouTube. You could live stream it, stream it on Twitch.
372000	374000	And, you know, videos on demand all through Twitch.
374000	383000	Well, that's the big problem with my garage, though, too, is that the light, I don't, I have these like giant, I think they're like eight foot fluorescent lights.
384000	387000	And I can't replace the bulbs in those because I can't, I can't.
387000	392000	If you need to borrow a light because my green screen had a whole lighting set up, I don't even use it.
392000	396000	So, if you just want to borrow it for a little while, it's like that whole like umbrella thing with like an LED light.
396000	397000	So, it's a really bright light.
397000	402000	Yeah, it's fine. I just need to replace the, I need to replace fluorescent tubes in there.
402000	405000	And they're like, they won't fit in my car. They're too big.
405000	412000	And how do you even get those out of there and dispose of them without, I guess I got to break them in half, which that'll be fun.
413000	415000	Breaking stuff is always fun.
415000	418000	Well, breaking something with toxic gas inside of it is always fun.
418000	420000	Yeah, and glass, you know.
420000	428000	So, I'll just have to, I mean, I'm going to replace it because I would like to have like something LED would be nice just so that I can see in there.
428000	429000	Because right now it's really dark.
429000	438000	I had to take an old lamp that we had in the house and it's like this like kind of Asian looking lamp thing and like punch out the, there's like some paper kind of diffusing inside to punch that all out.
438000	442000	And it sort of works. It's really dark.
442000	449000	All right, all right. Well, we'll continue to watch your progress over on your Twitter account with the cleaning of the machine.
449000	451000	AkumaJP thinks you should just put lots of lube on it.
451000	453000	Lots of lube on it?
453000	456000	Lube solves everything. I mean, there's nothing WD-40 can't fix.
456000	458000	I thought that was duct tape that solves everything.
458000	464000	I did, I did lubricate the, well, you have to be careful though the WD-40 because I did spray some in.
464000	469000	I was lubricating the screws that hold in the brackets in there.
469000	471000	It's kind of weird the setup that they have in there.
471000	475000	They have like these screws with spacers and then washers and it all sits in there very loose.
475000	479000	So like I like, oh, maybe I need to crank these down because this thing's wiggling around.
479000	481000	No, that's how it's supposed to be. It's supposed to be loose in there.
481000	489000	So I did spray those down WD-40 just to get all of like, there's like rust, like grime and stuff on there.
489000	493000	So I was trying to clean, clean those off because I'm like, I don't know how the hell to clean these.
493000	496000	So that's how I did that. But yeah, there is some WD-40.
496000	501000	But it did get on, I did notice it did get on some of the metal on the one side that I was spraying around.
501000	503000	I'm like, I agree. That's...
503000	506000	William Rutterface says, Reeb Goldberg that shit.
506000	508000	Yeah.
508000	512000	Quickly, before we get into the kickoff topic tonight, I did have to mention you because it's come up on OLR before,
512000	517000	even though this is probably a better topic for my other show, Shaking and Crying, cheap plug.
517000	519000	But I did have to mention you because we were talking about the show a couple weeks ago.
519000	525000	I did finally watch, I don't remember if you've seen it or not yet, Jamie, but I did finally watch the first two episodes of Queer Eye, the reboot on Netflix.
525000	527000	I haven't watched any yet.
527000	531000	Well, I was a little nervous about it because, you know, they changed all the guys and reboot.
531000	534000	You know, I get a little nervous about reboots, but it's really good.
534000	536000	I was, I was, it is really good.
537000	540000	The two over the top, like some of them, it felt like it was almost too forced.
540000	544000	Like they're trying to be, it was just like too much.
544000	548000	Okay. But like, like Jonathan, who is really extra, the heroin.
548000	550000	Yeah. He's the one long hair. He's like super extra.
550000	554000	But he actually reminds me of like some really good friends of mine.
554000	560000	Like, and the reason why I love them is because they're so extra, you know, like, and that's the way I kind of like about it.
560000	566000	I like it because like, they're not compromising anything about themselves for anything.
566000	568000	And, you know, they, they're just, they're who they are.
568000	577000	And, you know, um, one interaction I particularly liked in the first episode, not to get too spoilery, but I mean, it's a reality makeover show.
577000	580000	You can't really spoil those. I don't think you can, you can guess how each episode is going to go, right?
580000	583000	There's going to be lots of crying and people are going to get made over.
583000	591000	So, um, in the first episode though, they're driving the, you know, kind of, you know, middle fifties guy from the South because all these people are in Georgia.
591000	593000	Right. Cause the whole thing was based around Atlanta. Right.
593000	604000	So, um, they were out and more like the sticks part of Georgia and they're making over this guy and, uh, they're driving in the car and he goes, you know, Oh, so you and your partner or your husband have been married for 13 years.
604000	606000	He said, well married for five because that's, what's been legal.
606000	611000	And the, the straight guy that they're making over goes, so, uh, who's the husband and who's the wife.
611000	623000	You know, which is like, it's a common faux pas, but you kind of have to look at it and go, see if he had said that online, people would have replied to him and gone, you disgusting fucking trash bag piece of shit, blah, blah, blah.
623000	634000	And like in watching the interaction, you kind of go, he's not coming from a place of malice. You know, he said that because he doesn't know better.
634000	643000	And so I really liked the way that the, the, the team that was with it, cause it was only, some of them were with him, only Jonathan and the, the home, home design guy was Bobby.
643000	644000	Is his name Bobby?
644000	645000	I don't remember the name.
645000	654000	So they were with him and Bobby says, okay. Um, you know, that's a little bit like, uh, not a thing you want to ask, so let's break that down a little bit.
654000	663000	And, but I liked that they, they treated it with respect, like, you know, Hey, I'm going to educate you on why you shouldn't say that.
663000	665000	Like you just came from ignorance and not from malice.
665000	672000	Exactly. That was, that's a great way to put it. It was a statement of ignorance, not malice. And sometimes a lot of that gets lost on like social media and stuff like that.
672000	686000	So I liked that they kind of like took the opportunity to break it down. And I liked, you know, as extra as Jonathan can be, I really liked the fact that he said, Oh, well, you know, there's the, there's the sun energy and the moon energy and the sun energy is, is, was it the sun is masculine, the moon is feminine.
686000	700000	I don't know, but he had this way of describing it. It was very like horoscopy, but in a way that, you know, made a lot of sense was that, you know, it doesn't have to be defined necessarily by gender as our reigning queen, Sasha Velour says gender is a construct, tear it apart.
701000	729000	So anyway, not to, not to digress too far from video games, but you know, as the resident gay dude doing a podcast here at Orange Launch Radio, I can't help, but sometimes comment on some of these issues that even come up for me sometimes in the video game world, because certainly I've been asked from people who mean well, you know, who's the, who wears the pants and the relationship between me and Alan, which I think is the polite way of asking like, who's the top and who's the bottom.
730000	734000	When that question is kind of like, not really y'all's biz. You know what I mean? Like,
735000	739000	I think that saying who's the top and who's the bottom is a lot better than saying who's the wife.
740000	747000	Do I come to you? Well, that also implies that women are always on bottom and just saying, not the women I know.
747000	761000	I just like the one time someone asked, you know, because I'm really outspoken, duh, is, you know, so like, who wears the pants or something? And I'm like, well, both of us do because skirts are uncomfortable.
762000	773000	That's a good way of putting it. All right. Anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to get all like preachy or whatever, but I couldn't help but mention that because you mentioned you've been watching the show and I, I do hope they bring it back for a second season.
773000	788000	You know what show though? That's all NASA's around this tangent of TV shows real quick. We're at one sense. I just want to remind people though, that like, not all gay dudes are like the fab five because like when I watch that show, I look at it and I go, God, my life is a mess that needs repair.
789000	794000	Like it's kind of like, I kind of relate a lot to the guys they're making over sometimes. So I don't know. Anyway.
795000	801000	The Joel McHale show with Joel McHale, not so great. He's just not as funny as he used to be on the soup.
802000	819000	And my wife brought up a point though, you know, with it is that I don't think they have access to all the clips that they used to be able to access like all the TV shows because it seems like they're only showing one show on there and then international stuff.
819000	829000	So like they're showing like, um, hip hop wives of something or other. And that's like the only TV show that they referenced. And then it's like, Oh, and now let's talk about international shows.
830000	843000	And it's like, gee, you just not have access to talk about like these other shows. I mean, that's what it kind of seems like. It's like if you took the soup and then took out all the clips, it's like, that's, it's not that funny.
844000	846000	That's too bad. I watched something interesting today.
847000	854000	No, it's about games. Okay. Well, there's a series I like to watch that's on NHK TV that's called Begin Japanology.
855000	866000	And one of the ones that I caught today was about arcades in Japan. And so I was just like completely giggling. It's actually hosted by a man named Peter Berican.
866000	873000	His brother is a guitarist who actually performed with Heart when they did the...
874000	875000	Heart is amazing.
876000	879000	Crap. The tribute to Led Zeppelin when they did Stairway to Heaven.
880000	882000	Wasn't that like their early days? Heart started as like a Zeppelin tribute band, weren't they?
883000	886000	No, Heart was a folk rock band and then they went metal.
887000	890000	But this was like a few years ago when they did the Led Zeppelin tribute.
890000	891000	Okay.
892000	900000	But Peter Berican is also a DJ, a radio host in Japan. But they went inside game centers to show what they're like.
901000	906000	And like they were like doing, you know, they had Tekken 7 and Sound Vultex and Groove Coaster.
907000	908000	Good times.
909000	911000	And they were talking to people playing the music games and I was like, oh my God, it's us.
912000	918000	But it was pretty cool. There was some pachinko they went over, but not like, like legit pachinko halls.
918000	921000	Like there were a couple of pachislot games, you know, around, but they'd also had like the...
922000	925000	Did they show like what Konami is doing these days? Like here's Metal Gear pachinko, here's Silent Hill pachinko.
926000	932000	There was, it was really, and mostly they were in one of the, was it called Taito World, the Taito arcade.
933000	938000	And so they had the creator of Space Invader there and talking about, you know, how he put it together,
939000	945000	how they had to build their own, you know, microcomputers and all of this and, you know, comparing how big Space Invaders was.
945000	949000	But, and then they showed like the huge ass Space Invaders, which is the new one, you know?
950000	951000	Oh yeah, yeah.
952000	955000	And it was, it was neat with like, there's the floor of crane games and the techniques behind them.
956000	960000	And it was, it was, and then they showed like, like retro arcades.
961000	966000	Like, you know, bowling alleys were like, cause that was kind of, from what I could tell on that,
967000	969000	like the start of the arcade scene in Japan was in bowling alleys.
969000	976000	You brought up crane games in Japan. I, one of these days we'll get to our kickoff topic, but no, this is, this is important.
977000	981000	You brought up crane games in Japan. So what is that? Surely you've heard of this.
982000	986000	There's some new website out there that people play crane games like over the internet.
987000	993000	Like in, oh God, I shouldn't tell you about this because here's the thing, my husband is like addicted to it.
994000	995000	And have you seen those little like-
996000	997000	Do they ship you the things you win?
997000	1000000	Yes. Have you seen those little Japanese kitties in the living room?
1001000	1003000	He won all that shit on that website.
1004000	1005000	Oh my God.
1006000	1007000	How much are you spending on that website?
1008000	1010000	He says, we get a free ticket every day and he showed me the video.
1011000	1014000	He goes, and you like, he could like, you see video, it's like a webcam pointed at the crane thing.
1015000	1018000	And he showed like a video of him winning some big fat fucking kitty.
1019000	1021000	He's winning so much on that website. He's, he's like telling Shane,
1021000	1026000	Hey Shane, do you want a big like master Pokeball pillow thing I'm trying to give away that I won on a crane game?
1027000	1028000	I'm like, I want a master Pokeball.
1029000	1030000	What the fuck is happening?
1031000	1032000	What I want is a giant Anpanman pillow.
1033000	1039000	If someone wins me a giant Anpanman pillow, then, you know, I will be your, your friend forever.
1040000	1046000	Of course, you know, I'm still trying to, you know, find a copy of, um, Robert Mondieu.
1046000	1057000	So, but I have, okay, like I've never watched any of the animated episodes except the one with the French baguette man, but I love Anpanman cause he's just adorable.
1058000	1062000	I have an Anpanman plushie in my cubicle. I have an Anpanman key chain.
1063000	1066000	I have an Anpanman, you know, like all kinds of shit in my house.
1067000	1078000	This now I'm going to warn you, Jamie, before I tell you the name of this website, I want you to promise me you're going to use discretion girl on this website because I know you and craniums.
1079000	1083000	Okay. I found the box and they should be paying us for this shout out. I just want to say, you better send me more kitty dolls.
1084000	1090000	Okay. Toreba.net, T O R E B A dot net, T O R E B A dot net.
1091000	1093000	Sounds like, let them know.
1093000	1095000	This is like Toreba consult.
1096000	1098000	Toreba.net. That's what it says right there.
1099000	1100000	T O R E B A.
1101000	1103000	Oh, Toreba is what it says.
1104000	1112000	Okay. Whatever. T O R E B A dot net. And, um, if you do get on that website, tell them to send O L R more plushies because we just gave them a free ad.
1113000	1119000	But that is the website since you brought up crane games that Alan has been playing a lot. I'm going to still be in trouble if he's listening to this.
1120000	1122000	You can play it with your phone.
1123000	1125000	Well, here, here's the box.
1126000	1129000	Here. You can look at the packing slip with all the details.
1130000	1132000	Okay. It is Toreba.
1133000	1135000	Okay. T O R E B A.
1136000	1138000	That's what it said. No, it's not what you said.
1139000	1143000	As if it wasn't hard stuff from crane games. This is like ridiculous.
1144000	1147000	That was the thing. It was like, how do you do it if there's like a delay?
1148000	1149000	There's an app.
1149000	1154000	Oh God. So I apologize for ruining everybody's life. All right.
1155000	1157000	But I went, well, really it's Jamie's fault.
1158000	1162000	Try to find a way to shift the blame. You brought up crane games.
1163000	1164000	Crane games are great.
1165000	1168000	All right. Anyway, uh, act deaf.
1169000	1171000	And if you install the app, you get five free tries.
1172000	1173000	I can play this on my phone.
1173000	1177000	Act deaf and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, don't let me near this app.
1178000	1179000	Yeah. What the hell have you unleashed?
1180000	1182000	Right. I swear to God.
1183000	1184000	I can't run it on my Mac.
1185000	1186000	This website is going to be getting all these referrals.
1187000	1188000	I'm going to do this on my phone.
1189000	1190000	I should have charged him money. All right.
1191000	1194000	Anyway, in all seriousness, let's get into some actual video game discussion.
1195000	1200000	I want to talk about Nintendo Switch because Nintendo Switch just had a birthday this past week.
1200000	1202000	Uh, actual weekend. It was, it was yesterday, right?
1203000	1205000	Yesterday was the release March 3rd, right? Was the big release date.
1206000	1208000	I don't remember. Yeah. I think it was.
1209000	1211000	Yesterday is officially the one year birthday of the Nintendo Switch,
1212000	1216000	which also means it's the first birthday of Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild and so forth.
1217000	1219000	So I just kind of wanted to look back on a year of the Switch and kind of be like,
1220000	1222000	how do y'all feel about the Switch right now?
1223000	1225000	Because, um, you know, the Switch has been selling very well.
1225000	1229000	So I mean, despite whatever feelings we might have about the Switch, positive or negative,
1230000	1232000	the reality is the Switch is selling very well right now.
1233000	1234000	So it does seem to be a success story for Nintendo.
1235000	1237000	I think it's going to be around for certainly a few more years.
1238000	1241000	Um, do you think, because I think this is kind of inevitable from Nintendo,
1242000	1245000	there'll be some type of Switch, but with different hardware,
1246000	1248000	meaning like either a bigger screen, a smaller screen,
1249000	1252000	a different chip in there or something like a Switch Plus or something.
1252000	1255000	I think that's inevitable from Nintendo at some point,
1256000	1258000	because it's worked for them on the DS side of things.
1259000	1261000	And even when it came to things like the Nintendo Wii,
1262000	1264000	they came out in different colors and then wasn't there the Wii,
1265000	1267000	well, Wii Motion Plus, but that was a little bit of a different thing.
1268000	1270000	That was more of like, we just forgot to put some hardware in there.
1271000	1274000	Yeah, but it kind of did change a, a, a fundamental, uh, uh, part of it.
1275000	1279000	Um, so what do you guys think a year in here on the Switch?
1279000	1282000	Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1283000	1285000	Akuma JP says, I am still playing Zelda.
1286000	1287000	I could, I could imagine.
1288000	1289000	That's what we've been doing.
1290000	1293000	Yeah, right? Like that game is so vast that I can imagine people are still spending a lot of time with that.
1294000	1298000	In fact, uh, as part of the year, you know, anniversary to kind of commemorate that,
1299000	1303000	Nintendo actually released some special artwork, uh, which you can check out, uh,
1304000	1305000	on the official Legend of Zelda Twitter.
1305000	1308000	Uh, you can actually, uh, download this nice little piece of artwork.
1309000	1312000	It's a great like desktop background, something they did to celebrate one year of
1313000	1316000	the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, which is obviously the same day as the Nintendo Switch.
1317000	1321000	Something else that was in the news this week, um, now I, we addressed this on the show last week
1322000	1324000	is that there were rumors about Diablo coming to Switch,
1325000	1330000	but those just kind of intensified this week because Blizzard posted some type of, uh, tweet
1330000	1335000	where they had a Diablo Lite Switch that was turning on and off.
1336000	1339000	Now, it turns out this little light was something that they gave away at BlizzCon a few years ago,
1340000	1344000	so it wasn't something that they just came up with, but the timing of it seemed really kind of funky
1345000	1346000	and people were like, oh, Blizzard's fucking with us now.
1347000	1349000	There's something true to this whole Diablo on the Switch.
1350000	1351000	Well, Blizzard did put out an official statement saying,
1352000	1357000	we cannot confirm this rumor. As of now, we don't have any current plans to announce Diablo for Switch.
1357000	1363000	This tweet was meant to be a fun engagement piece. We do not have any plans to announce Diablo for Switch.
1364000	1369000	That's pretty more clear cut than the usual, we don't comment on rumors or speculation type of thing,
1370000	1375000	but at the same time, you could also read into that as, you know, well, they don't plan to announce it today,
1376000	1384000	but wait for E3 or BlizzCon or, you know, whatever opportunity Blizzard would want to use to do something like that.
1384000	1387000	So would it be like Diablo 3, you think?
1388000	1397000	Well, I would hope. In my gut, it's some type of Diablo 3 expansion that they are also going to put on Nintendo Switch.
1398000	1404000	Kind of like when they first released Guardian of Souls. I don't even remember the name of the expansion now.
1405000	1409000	Diablo 3 Revenge of Souls, Return of Souls, whatever the hell the expansion was called for Diablo 3.
1409000	1421000	That was also the point. So they put out the expansion on PC and then they also put that combined game on PlayStation 3 and regular Xbox at the time, I think.
1422000	1427000	Or was that when they first rolled it out on PlayStation 4? I think it was when they first rolled it out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
1428000	1435000	I think they did put the base game on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and then the expansion was kind of like the all-in-one for the newer systems.
1435000	1439000	So it would be cool if they released another expansion and then put that as well on Nintendo Switch.
1440000	1445000	Thank you to Artisia, Reaper of Souls. I knew it was something Souls. So that was the name of the expansion.
1446000	1455000	So, anyway, we talked about this already a little bit last week. I think Diablo 3 on Switch would be like that LAN experience that people are looking for.
1455000	1466000	But, you know, also I'm torn because Diablo 3 is kind of old at this point. So it would be very nice if there was a new expansion or something to get us a little more excited about Diablo 3 again.
1467000	1477000	Or hell, just go for it and do Diablo 4. But, you know, I know Blizzard's timetable is a slow one. So I'll do Diablo 4 sometime in like 2025. We'll see.
1478000	1487000	Loki, what are your thoughts on the Switch one year in? I know you've been both critical, but also, you know, you've said some positive things too. So what are your thoughts on Switch a year in?
1488000	1501000	I'm glad it's doing well. I just wish that there's more that they were doing with it. I mean, I think in this day and age it's kind of hard to excuse a company that doesn't have the features that they're kind of showing off.
1502000	1513000	You know, a year into the console. I mean, I don't know. So I'm still waiting to see what they do for their online stuff. I'm glad that they had some really good successes with their games that they've released.
1514000	1524000	So we'll just have to see. Hopefully that keeps going on. They've been really fortunate though with all of the indie games because that seems to be really helping with what they've got on the platform.
1524000	1534000	But yeah, that would be interesting to see what happens. Jamie, not to distract you from the crane games, but what are your thoughts on Switch a year in here?
1535000	1549000	I love my Switch. I'm glad I didn't pay for it. Yeah, because I seem to remember if we go back a year ago, you weren't originally planning on buying one. You ended up with one anyway. Lucky, lucky. But now that you have it, you're happy with it?
1549000	1560000	Yeah, I super love it. Yeah, we've been playing a lot of Breath of the Wild on it, you know, on our second playthrough of it. Just, you know, we've had people overplaying arms and, oh, he's snoring.
1561000	1563000	Mr. Smoosh is snoring. That's why we're all kind of like looking over there.
1564000	1570000	Because we had two joy cons, we could actually do four player arms and it was pretty fun. So it was, yeah, we really enjoy it.
1570000	1580000	What do you guys hope the Nintendo Switch does in the next year? I think the obvious answer and the one I'm going to go with obviously would be, I want to know more about this online service.
1581000	1591000	And are you going to really be able to play virtual console games across the internet? And if so, are they going to be adding anything to it? Like, will I be able to see video of my friends as they play?
1591000	1602000	Because, you know, most of those virtual console games are in the old 4x3 resolution, so it's only going to use part of the TV. So it's kind of like when I'm streaming retro games on Twitch.
1603000	1611000	There's going to be a good chunk of the screen that can be dedicated to webcam and who knows whatever else. So can I actually see my friends while I play virtual console games online or something?
1612000	1613000	No.
1614000	1615000	Too much to ask.
1616000	1618000	There's not enough oomph in the hardware for that. I'm sorry.
1618000	1622000	Well, what do you want to see Nintendo do in the next year with the Switch?
1623000	1632000	Um, release some more games that are originals and not remakes. Basically, here's Mario Kart 8 with the tracks and one additional character.
1633000	1638000	Well, what do you consider something like Metroid Prime 4? Is that a good game?
1639000	1640000	Yeah, that'd be a good game.
1641000	1643000	What about your thoughts, Jamie? What do you want to see Nintendo Switch do?
1644000	1645000	Animal Crossing.
1645000	1647000	Not from the mobile phone game, so something legit.
1648000	1649000	No, a real Animal Crossing.
1650000	1651000	A real Animal Crossing.
1652000	1653000	And then Dan would never see the Switch again.
1654000	1655000	Are you still playing Animal Crossing on mobile?
1656000	1657000	Heck yeah.
1658000	1663000	They're doing more of the flower special things right now, but they put out more characters, which has been pretty cool.
1664000	1670000	Dartitsia points out, well I don't think the Switch has a webcam anyway, at least not yet. I guess that's true, I'm forgetting. That was the Wii U that had the camera.
1671000	1672000	You can build one out of cardboard.
1672000	1675000	Who knows? Or you can use your phone app to do it. Who knows?
1676000	1677000	Oh yeah.
1678000	1687000	Akuma JP in chat says, I want smaller, more slick, and portable friendly looking Switch. So kind of going for the hardware model redevelopment, which I think is a distinct possibility.
1688000	1692000	I don't know if we would see that this soon, but I think maybe in the next two years we'll see something like that.
1693000	1696000	And Dungeon Buster says, I want the Pro Controller price to drop for the Switch.
1697000	1698000	Well, if they're still selling at the current price.
1699000	1701000	All of their accessories need to drop in price, honestly.
1702000	1710000	Sia Tabiri in chat says, I'd like to see them bring a bunch of eShop Switch versions of investigation games from the DS on.
1711000	1719000	So maybe, I don't know if you would call that virtual console, but maybe some ports of great, you know, continuing to do ports of the games that people may have missed.
1720000	1722000	So, maybe a little different than what you were suggesting, Loki.
1723000	1728000	And lastly, I will say here, Akuma JP in chat says, most of all, I want Bluetooth.
1728000	1735000	I thought the controllers were already Bluetooth, in the way they worked. I thought that's how that worked.
1736000	1737000	It might be Wi-Fi Direct, I don't know.
1738000	1749000	Maybe. Anyway, so some thoughts on the Nintendo Switch one year in here, and yeah, congrats to Nintendo, it's been a very successful year, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what their holiday lineup looks like this year.
1750000	1754000	I'm really excited about Metroid Prime 4. I would like to see F-Zero, even though it's never going to happen.
1754000	1764000	But I feel like they're going to have to have some other kind of like big AAA-ish game, and I kind of feel like this might be the year for Smash Brothers.
1765000	1772000	But if it is, if Smash Brothers is this year, it's just going to be a port of the existing Smash for Wii and 3DS.
1773000	1774000	I think, if anything, I would...
1775000	1778000	With some new characters, new stages, but essentially the same game.
1779000	1782000	I could see them doing a re-release of Mario Maker, maybe.
1782000	1790000	But they would need the infrastructure, because right now with Miiverse gone, I don't know how that's going to...
1791000	1796000	Well, I mean, they patched it out on Wii U, and it still works. The game's still functional, so they can figure that out.
1797000	1805000	Yeah, with Super Mario Brothers 2 style, and maybe Game Boy or something like that.
1805000	1810000	I mean, I do want them to get away from ports as well, but at the same time, I feel like if they don't...
1811000	1815000	Like, Smash Brothers games are usually in development for years and years and years before we see them.
1816000	1819000	So if it's not some type of re-do of the last one, I feel like it's just going to take forever.
1820000	1826000	More like a legit WarioWare game, and not the 1-2 Switch bullshit. That was garbage.
1827000	1828000	A new WarioWare, I could go for that.
1829000	1830000	A WarioWare game would be awesome.
1830000	1835000	Super Multitasking by YYR on the Nintendo Switch. That's what I want to see.
1836000	1837000	Alright.
1838000	1839000	Excite Truck.
1840000	1842000	Heck yeah, there's a series to bring back. I thought you said no ports.
1843000	1845000	No, I said new one. This isn't porting.
1846000	1847000	New Exciter, alright.
1848000	1850000	And not Excite Bots, because that was an abortion.
1851000	1856000	Alright, let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks, and the type of games that we have been playing this week.
1856000	1861000	And I will start with Loki, because Jamie got up to get a coffee. So I'll start with Loki on How Was Your Gaming Week.
1862000	1865000	Well, I played more Dance Dance Revolution.
1866000	1870000	And like I said, I started taking apart the pads on Saturday.
1871000	1878000	So, just trying to get it so that I can actually play doubles again, and so that I'm not just missing steps, even though I am stepping on the pads.
1879000	1885000	So, let's see. Then aside from that, mobile stuff. I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon Go.
1886000	1889000	Playing a little bit of Ingress as well.
1890000	1895000	And a little bit of the Office Space Clicker game. They're not even really a clicker game. It's like a...
1896000	1898000	I guess it's sort of a clicker game, but it's not.
1899000	1902000	So I've been playing the Office Space mobile game, but I really hardly go back to that.
1903000	1905000	Just every few days, so I can keep gaming my free characters.
1905000	1910000	But it's just, they turn it into such a grind. It's ridiculous.
1911000	1920000	Yeah, nothing really mobile or anything, because I've been doing a lot of programming for work, so I haven't really been playing games, sadly.
1921000	1924000	And I need to actually work on my game. I keep thinking about that.
1925000	1926000	Yes, you do.
1927000	1931000	Alright, I'll talk about My Gaming Week. My Gaming Week, I also continue to do mobile adventures.
1931000	1939000	I played, you know, Ingress, and I played Pokemon Go, and I downloaded a new location-based game.
1940000	1944000	It's called like Magus, I think it is, or Magus. M-A-G-U-S-S is what it's called.
1945000	1946000	The 23rd Magus?
1947000	1954000	No, sadly, no. Although that would be a great name. He's referencing a guest character we had here on OLR plenty of times. Missed that guy.
1954000	1965000	Anyway, but in this game, it's kind of like a little bit more of the traditional role-playing game where you battle monsters, but you actually see the monsters out and about in the real world.
1966000	1969000	Not like AR, but you just see little icons that reference them on the map.
1970000	1979000	But the thing about Magus that shows there, like I'm showing Loki, here's what the house looks like, and there's some monsters in range, so I want to battle when I tap on it.
1979000	1987000	And then instead of hitting, like, attack, run, or item, you draw, like, little symbols to actually do the different attacks.
1988000	1994000	Yeah, it's neat, but the problem with it is, I'm finding there's not a lot of reason for the location.
1995000	2004000	Like, the thing about things like Ingress, Pokemon Go, heck, even the knockoff games like, you know, Draconis Go, or the things that came before it, like Munzee, which was basically geocaching.
2004000	2015000	There's no real point to locations on the map. There's no, like, places to go. You're not going to a location to claim it for your team, or you're not going to battle for something.
2016000	2019000	So it just seems like the real-world element of it is kind of secondary.
2020000	2024000	So is there, like, not really a whole bunch of location-based apps out there? Because I would have thought that, like, there'd be a ton.
2025000	2030000	You would think now, especially after Pokemon Go or a year out. I mean, we're seeing more coming down the turnpike.
2030000	2036000	Obviously Niantic's got their own Harry Potter thing. We know it's going to happen. Activision announced the Ghostbusters thing, which we got into last week.
2037000	2045000	So we know more are coming. It's just at this moment, we don't have a lot else that aren't, like, really badly, like, Garfield Go, which is garbage.
2046000	2056000	You know, like, and Draconis Go is kind of, like, for me, it's mostly, like, a really kind of copy of a copy that does bring some new elements to the table, but it kind of got old for me real fast.
2056000	2061000	You know what I mean? So there's not really that same community in a game like Draconis Go.
2062000	2064000	So anyway, that's been my mobile gaming this week.
2065000	2072000	As far as console and PC gaming, I've been continuing to play Heroes of the Storm, which I still play, Final Fantasy XIV, of course.
2073000	2077000	But I also spent some time with Final Fantasy XV again for the first time in a long time.
2078000	2082000	You know, I did play when the game first came out on PlayStation 4. I played through the whole game, beat it.
2082000	2092000	And I was mostly happy with it, except then I started to get more discouraged when I heard that, oh, they're going to go back and change chapter 13.
2093000	2101000	And, oh, they're going to go back and put all this other stuff. And, you know, and obviously we heard continuing on in this past week, oh, we have plans to keep Final Fantasy XV going through 2019.
2102000	2109000	And so I'm kind of like, what the fuck? Like, then what did I play? Like, the half-assed done game or something? I don't know. So that was a little frustrating.
2109000	2113000	But I did want to revisit it because they put out the PC demo this week.
2114000	2121000	So the Final Fantasy XV demo is out on PC, and you can download it on Steam, and I think it's on Origin as well. So I downloaded it to check it out.
2122000	2130000	And it's fairly robust because it's the actual game through Chapter 1, which doesn't sound like a lot, but there was only 13 chapters in the game.
2130000	2139000	So Chapter 1 takes you a good chunk of, you know, the first area onto the Sea Town, Golden Key or whatever it was called, to, like, the first quest after that.
2140000	2146000	You have your first run-in with, you know, some CD characters and so forth. So it's a pretty good chunk of the game.
2147000	2157000	It runs, like, it looks really nice on PC because, you know, you can run it, if your graphics card can handle it, you can run it 4K, 120 frames a second, if your graphics card can handle it.
2157000	2164000	Mine can't handle that, but it could do the 2K at a pretty decent 60 frames a second, and it looked really good.
2165000	2169000	And it almost made me go, like, gosh, I might want to drop the 40 bucks to play this again.
2170000	2177000	But then I stopped myself, and it was all because of that whole thing that came out last week where they said, oh, we're going to keep working on this game into 2019.
2177000	2186000	I said, you know what, nope, Rob, don't fall for it. When they finally say it's done, then you can go back and play it because at that point it'll probably be cheaper anyway.
2187000	2192000	Or they'll have some jumbo, ultra, all the DLC and the entire FnWorld pack that you can check out.
2193000	2199000	But if you've never played Final Fantasy XV, I mean, it is a free demo, go check, draw your own conclusion if it's something you'd want to play or not.
2199000	2212000	The battle system is kind of fun. There are things I like about Final Fantasy XV, but in the greater scheme of all the Final Fantasy games, it kind of falls somewhere in the middle for me.
2213000	2217000	It's not the best, but it's not the worst. Anyway, that was Final Fantasy XV on PC for me.
2217000	2221000	Otherwise, continuing to play a little bit of super multitasking, so shout out to our pal Aaron.
2222000	2227000	And again, if you haven't checked this game out on Steam, I really urge you to. I want to see it do well for Aaron, especially you streamers.
2228000	2231000	Stream some of yourself playing super multitasking. It's a lot of fun.
2232000	2238000	And I think that's really it. Oh, Pac-Man Championship Edition 2. I'm still continuing to play that.
2238000	2244000	And I played through all the co-op levels, and I've been trying to work on some of my single player scores.
2245000	2249000	And I did some streaming of that the other night where I was trying to beat my score, and spoiler alert, I never did.
2250000	2254000	But I did get some pretty decent scores, but I've just been still working on that, trying to better myself.
2255000	2262000	And what is essentially, I feel like trying to get the perfect run in Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 is very similar to speedrunning in a lot of ways.
2262000	2268000	It is really about memorizing which boards do I do which tricks on, and what dots do I eat, and which pattern.
2269000	2274000	There's a lot of similar stuff there, so yeah, I will probably keep at that at least for a little while.
2275000	2282000	Going to our chat over at live.voggenetwork.com. Let's see, Ragenator in chat says, Rob Roberts, go ahead and buy it.
2283000	2289000	Just pretend that it's called Mass Effect 3. Ah, but the Mass Effect costumes were in Final Fantasy XIII-2.
2289000	2299000	We'll talk about costumes for Final Fantasy XV a little later in the show, because there was some interesting, to say the least, stuff announced in that this week.
2300000	2310000	Let's see, also over at live.voggenetwork.com, let's see, Dungeon Buster says, the combat was fun in Final Fantasy XV for me.
2311000	2313000	Once I got the hang of synchronized attacks, it could get crazy.
2314000	2321000	AkumaJP in chat says, well, you still played it at that time, but will you still play it at that time, I mean?
2322000	2332000	Oh, in 2019, when I finally get around to playing it? Again? I mean, I've already beaten it, so you can't really read me for never beating games on that one.
2333000	2341000	Because I did beat the original release of Final Fantasy XV, but I just would prefer not to do it again until the complete release of Final Fantasy XV is available.
2341000	2349000	Does that make sense? Anyway, I guess that's it for my gaming week, so we'll go to DarkSakura, who's back with coffee.
2350000	2351000	Coffee is delicious.
2352000	2353000	How was your gaming week?
2354000	2355000	I'm glad that you still have that ripple.
2356000	2357000	The what?
2358000	2359000	The ripple vegetable protein half and half.
2360000	2361000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2361000	2369000	Yesterday, I hit a personal milestone, so Dan and I celebrated by staying in our pajamas all day and playing Breath of the Wild.
2370000	2374000	He is trying to perfect his shield reflect, and I am trying to perfect the recipes.
2375000	2379000	I told you he got me that book Banquet of the Wild, right? That's got all the recipes in it.
2380000	2387000	Yes, yes. That makes me think, funny enough, with Final Fantasy XV, I think there's a similar cookbook for Ignis' cooking recipes.
2387000	2395000	But I like those things. We should reach back out to Game Tim and have him on, because he does the cooking with Cooking Mama.
2396000	2401000	But I should send him those recipes and figure it out.
2402000	2414000	But anyway, I'm playing World of Warcraft. I'm really enjoying, you know, I never played Horde up from low level, you know, that lasted for very long.
2415000	2418000	I think I had one, but it was during Cataclysm.
2419000	2425000	So I'm going back and doing a lot of the quests that I had never done, and it's like a new game for me.
2425000	2431000	It's really fun, and I'm really enjoying my Nightborne character, although sometimes I'm like, this conflict in the game is stupid.
2432000	2433000	You know, but anyway.
2434000	2441000	So I've had a fun time doing that. I'm playing Animal Crossing still on my phone, because it's the only fix I can get.
2442000	2447000	What else do I have? Oh yeah, Pokemon Go, I'm playing some Ingress.
2448000	2454000	It's just that while I don't have a whole lot of energy, I can't really walk around a bunch of places and do stuff.
2455000	2459000	I will open both when I'm downtown and just try to take whatever.
2460000	2464000	So now I'm playing this crane game. Thanks!
2465000	2470000	I tried three times to win an Anpanman blanket. I didn't win it. I'm very sad.
2471000	2473000	These machines are picked clean. They are.
2473000	2476000	I think a ton of people are playing this site, so I'm not surprised.
2477000	2482000	But I played it on my phone, so it was kind of fun. I'm also playing the Bust-A-Move on iPhone.
2483000	2488000	And it's fun, but again, I hate to get these power-ups. I'm like, bitch, I ain't using your power-ups.
2489000	2494000	I haven't used a single fucking power-up in that game, and I'm like on level 44 or something.
2495000	2497000	It's fun, because you know I love my Puzzle Bobble.
2498000	2504000	And, um, what else was I playing? Because it was another one that they changed it to be like that, and I thought it was stupid.
2505000	2507000	Oh yeah, Peggle. Because I also love Peggle.
2508000	2514000	And it's another one of those, like, Peggle Blast. Bleh. Like, just make it Peggle.
2515000	2522000	I don't need it to blast. I just need Peggle. Give me the balls. The little balls that hit the other balls and make them disappear.
2524000	2525000	Balls.
2526000	2531000	We also, um, I also did play some pinball. We might be getting the Getaway 2.
2532000	2533000	Oh, nice.
2534000	2539000	If it works out, it's a local dude who supplies the machines at Coin-Op.
2540000	2545000	If it works out, it'll be nice to have, but we're also getting Dan's Mustang back, so we don't really have.
2546000	2548000	So do you want to hold on to some pinballs for us?
2549000	2552000	You're gonna bring a pinball machine over here and store it at our house?
2552000	2554000	If Dan doesn't mind. We need to make room.
2557000	2560000	Okay, I'll talk to Alan about it. I might be into that, actually.
2562000	2567000	Yeah, if you guys really should. No, we wouldn't put it in here. We would put it, if it's not for the garage, because there's plenty of room in the garage.
2568000	2573000	Especially if we moved the big stack of boxes that are out there and just need to get cleaned up, there'd be plenty of room out there.
2574000	2582000	So if not in a garage, then maybe that guest room that we have is basically Mr. Smoosh's room.
2583000	2589000	Yeah. The thing is, just be very careful with Smooshy around it, because I told you Midna clawed our Black Knight.
2590000	2592000	Then maybe the garage would be best, because Smoosh didn't go out there.
2593000	2595000	Yeah, but I'll bring it up to Dan.
2596000	2598000	No, please, no pressure either way.
2598000	2605000	But no, we were talking about needing a home for some of the tables while we moved things around.
2606000	2617000	And we've, I don't know if we'd, like, we'd probably want to lend out, like, Judge Dredd, and he just got Creature, so I don't know if he'd want to let Creature out.
2618000	2623000	Creature from the Black Lagoon. But maybe, like, Black Knight. I mean, I think he actually wants to move Black Knight inside, so it might be Twilight Zone.
2624000	2626000	Okay. Something like that. Or Star Trek.
2626000	2630000	Or Star Trek. We have the tournament edition of Star Trek, the movie, the new movie one.
2631000	2632000	You know what they say, beggars can't be choosers.
2633000	2634000	Yeah. They have medieval madness.
2635000	2636000	Oh, good.
2637000	2638000	It's a fun one.
2639000	2640000	Alright, anything else for your gaming week? I'm assuming that's no.
2641000	2647000	No. And by the way, since Brad brought up that a Mustang would be the only Ford he'd own, it's a 69 Mustang coupe.
2648000	2649000	Oh yeah, it's a sweet car.
2650000	2654000	Dan's car is, he needs to put air conditioning in that fucker though, because it gets hot here.
2654000	2659000	Alright, let's see, I'm going to get to some housekeeping and then we're going to get into the rest of the gaming news for this week.
2660000	2666000	So housekeeping, of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r. We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2667000	2671000	Some upcoming weekends where there will not be a show either live or on podcast.
2672000	2676000	March 25th, I'm not going to be here. I'm going to be out of town, and that's just three weeks away.
2677000	2683000	So there'll be no show the week of March 25th, and I do have another day, and my co-hosts don't even know about this, another day to add to the calendar.
2684000	2687000	So everyone's going to kind of, it's going to kind of suck, but we'll work with it.
2688000	2696000	June 24th, I'm not going to be here, and the reason why that kind of sucks is that that's the day after our 16th birthday, so we'll just celebrate it a week early.
2697000	2698000	I'm not going to be here Easter.
2699000	2700000	Oh, you're not going to be here Easter?
2701000	2705000	Because it's sisters, the sisters in the park with hunky Jesus.
2706000	2709000	Uh oh, so that's April, ooh, that might be, is that two weeks back, that's two weeks?
2709000	2717000	And that ain't a joke. I'm going to be in Dolores Park with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, so if you're in San Francisco, come party.
2718000	2725000	Yeah, so we may tape a show. I'm going to talk to you guys about trying to tape a show that week, so at least there's something, because I hate going two weeks with no show.
2726000	2731000	I know we did it a couple times last year, but that was due to really extreme circumstances, so we'll see what we can do about that.
2732000	2737000	So it sounds like there might not be a live show April 1st. That's too bad, because that's April Fool's Day. Who put Easter on April Fool's Day?
2737000	2752000	Thanks. Well, you know that Easter is still a holiday based off of the Jewish calendar, because since it has to do with...
2753000	2754000	It moves.
2755000	2760000	It moves, which is like how a lot of our, okay, and so I have to answer this for IkumaJP, who says, hunky Jesus what?
2761000	2763000	It's a San Francisco thing. There's your answer.
2763000	2767000	They have a bunch of dudes dressed up as Jesus.
2768000	2769000	I've heard of this, yeah.
2770000	2772000	And it's a beauty contest for Jesus. Kind of.
2773000	2781000	Why not? Alright, anyway, so anyway, I'm actually going back to Chicago in June, and it's official. We have the plane tickets and everything, so we're definitely going back.
2781000	2788000	And so that's going to happen in June, and so we'll do our 16th anniversary show the week before.
2789000	2793000	So that'll be like the 18th, I think, is the week that'll be.
2794000	2799000	Alright, awesome. So let's move on and get into some gaming news. Loki.
2800000	2802000	Alright, I think we'll just, let's see here.
2803000	2805000	So Mario Odyssey. Let's talk a little bit about that.
2806000	2816000	We talked a little bit about how there was some frustration with this brand new, like, balloon hunting mode that they have in the game.
2817000	2824000	So, kind of to combat some of that, Nintendo has put out a patch to patch out some of the different glitches in the game.
2825000	2828000	Unfortunately, this is also causing problems for people. It's speedrun the game.
2828000	2841000	So, with this, they've patched out two of the different glitches of these for some of the Any% runs, which has normally, I think that saves about like 15 seconds of time.
2842000	2851000	So they have the syncs clip and the turnip clip, and with that now, that's kind of bringing the problem of how do we, how do we first off run this now?
2851000	2860000	And two, how do we differentiate these world record times with, you know, version 1 versus 1.2, that type of stuff.
2861000	2865000	So, there's, you know, the thought that they're going to just split them up.
2866000	2877000	Also, they're basically saying that, you know, hey, we're kind of at the mercy of Nintendo of what they patch out in this game because, you know, I mean, I guess that would be with any modern game.
2877000	2882000	Like, you know, you don't know what's going to be patched out if you're running one version of the game versus another. I mean, that could be a problem.
2883000	2887000	Version numbering makes a lot of sense, though, for how to track it. You track it by version number.
2888000	2891000	I think so, too. Yeah. So, we'll see how that goes.
2892000	2898000	But something also that came out with some of these patches as well, as with a lot of things, people like to data mine stuff.
2898000	2909000	And with the patch 1.2, people data mined, they found that there's a group of 20 thumbnail images that appear, I guess, from different levels.
2910000	2918000	And these images show the location on the, it looks like that indicates where certain stars might be, or moons might be hidden.
2919000	2921000	And these would be stuff that's not currently in the game.
2921000	2929000	So, could it be that we're going to be getting more power moons we add to the game? Possibly.
2930000	2935000	And then new hats are kind of being shown off as well, so they have more hidden artwork.
2936000	2941000	Well, any way you slice it, Mario Odyssey is still not done. That's clear. It's still something that they are also adding to.
2942000	2949000	Except, I don't know, it feels, here's the thing. Mario Odyssey, that type of stuff bugs me way less than it does in a game like Final Fantasy XV.
2949000	2955000	Because Final Fantasy XV is very story-driven, right? Whereas a game like Mario Odyssey is not really story-driven.
2956000	2963000	I mean, Mario's rescuing the princess or whatever, you know, it's not that, you know, it's not that big a story in the game.
2964000	2969000	You know, when you add things like new levels or new locations, it doesn't really feel the same thing as it does in Final Fantasy XV.
2970000	2976000	We're like, oh, we didn't like the way Chapter XIII was done, so we're going to go back and redo it with some extra narrative in it.
2976000	2978000	It's like, it's completely different, right?
2979000	2980000	I don't know, I haven't got past Chapter 1 yet.
2981000	2990000	Well, no, I guess I'm just saying, like, I realize I'm saying, I see on one hand here, I like the patching and the fact that it never ends over here, but I don't like it over here.
2991000	2993000	And I'm trying to, like, put my finger on what the difference is.
2994000	2996000	Yeah, I mean, I get your point.
2999000	3002000	And there's also, I mean, I guess they do have lots of costumes in the game, but there's no cup noodles.
3002000	3012000	And there's no, what the hell was that, like, apparently if you buy the game on Origin or something, you get some really fucked up, like, Llama superhero costumes.
3013000	3015000	Well, hold on, because I think we have more coming later on that, so.
3016000	3024000	So it's just, like, weird shit. So you don't have that weird shit. Although, they did have the Mercedes thing with Mario Kart 8, so, I mean, there could be potential down the road.
3025000	3036000	DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, at the AGDQ events, the runners sometimes let everyone know which version of the game they're running because their run relies on specific things a build does.
3037000	3046000	I did watch a lot of AGDQ stuff as well. That's one of the things I've been doing instead of playing games. So I did get to watch Blaster Master Zero, which that game looks fantastic.
3047000	3056000	I just like, they ran it as Shantae, which is kind of cool, so I like how they have all the other DLC characters you can play as, but, um, really cool game.
3057000	3058000	Anyway.
3059000	3075000	Alright, so we're gonna move on with some more stories, and talking about something that was released this week that got a lot of people excited until they installed it and played it, and that would be the Chrono Trigger re-release for PC via Steam.
3075000	3092000	That's right, for the first time, the classic RPG Chrono Trigger is now available on Steam for $14.99, which includes some extra dungeons that were not originally in the game, but they were in the DS and mobile releases that include the Dimensional Vortex dungeon and the Lost Sanctum dungeon.
3092000	3106000	If you buy the game before April 2nd, you get, I guess, a digital song file that has a medley of different songs, you get some digital liner notes for the soundtrack, and some different wallpapers. Ooh, ah, so nothing that really affects the game, but some extras.
3107000	3108000	I'll wait for a sale.
3109000	3113000	And then they say updated graphics and sound, updated controls, optimized PC experience.
3114000	3115000	And say better, they said updated.
3115000	3123000	Optimized PC experience that supports both controller and mouse keyboard configuration, and then an autosave feature. So here's the punchline. It's the mobile game.
3124000	3133000	They ported the mobile game to PC, just like they'd already done with Final Fantasy IV, V, VI, and now this.
3134000	3141000	So, you know, it shouldn't be that big of a shock that what we got was the mobile port, because Square Enix has done it already with several Final Fantasy games.
3141000	3149000	But still, some people got really excited, saw Chrono Trigger on Steam, and they bought it right away, and then they were like, oh, it's the tablet version.
3150000	3152000	Well, that's why they have those Steam refunds.
3153000	3162000	Yeah, I mean, if you wanted to do that, there's a Steam refund. Maybe you won't care. Maybe you've never played Chrono Trigger before, and, you know, I mean, at least the mobile port, like, kind of keeps the graphics of the original.
3163000	3167000	They don't do what they did in Final Fantasy VI and, like, update the sprites to these kind of, like, cheaper-looking things.
3167000	3180000	So, I mean, there is that. You know, I'm not going to come out and say, oh, it's just straight-up bad, but I just feel like the best way to play Chrono Trigger is on a fucking Super Nintendo, or I would say the DS version, not bad.
3181000	3188000	The DS version was a pretty good way to do it. Actually, the PlayStation port, even though it had the whole, like, loading thing, it wasn't that bad.
3188000	3200000	And that was in the compilation with Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger? Or was it Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger that came out together? Was it IV and V and then VI and Chrono Trigger? I don't know, but anyway.
3201000	3203000	The graphics don't look that updated.
3204000	3208000	For Chrono Trigger, they weren't. For Final Fantasy VI, they were.
3209000	3211000	But, I mean, they don't look that much cleaner.
3212000	3214000	Well, because they weren't changed.
3215000	3217000	Oh, I thought you said that they were, like, updated.
3218000	3227000	Final Fantasy, oh, I see. Oh, yeah, it says updated graphics and sound. It says optimized visuals designed for modern PCs. Yeah, it doesn't really look like they've changed a lot with it, honestly.
3228000	3232000	Yeah, they haven't. And I've got it on SNES. Like, I have a cartridge, so, screw this.
3233000	3241000	Nah, yeah, I'm going to pass on it as well. And Square Enix, I don't want to support this whole, like, Square Enix doing these cheap mobile ports for PC. You know, show the PC a little love.
3242000	3245000	You know, the Final Fantasy XV port seems to do well on PC.
3246000	3247000	That can download all the animation.
3248000	3254000	So, anyway, Chrono Trigger on Steam, I'm going to pass, even though Chrono Trigger, you know, it is a good game.
3255000	3261000	Despite the long-running in-joke here at VOG about Chrono Trigger vs. Super Metroid on which is the best of all time.
3262000	3263000	Chrono Trigger.
3264000	3266000	Super Metroid, but I can still say Chrono Trigger is a great game.
3267000	3270000	So, anyway, let's move on. Dark Sakura, what do you have?
3270000	3285000	Well, finally, it's happening on our home releases. There's going to be a label put out for video games that warn if it has content that would need to be bought with real world currency.
3286000	3294000	Like, we already have it on mobile games that, you know, it says warning contains in-app purchases or something like that.
3294000	3303000	Both Apple and Google have done it. But now the ESRB is trying to address the problem with in-game purchases for physical video games.
3304000	3310000	So they are going to require that any video game sold has the in-game purchases labeled on it.
3311000	3317000	Especially if it's going to cost real world money. So, you know, if it's like virtual currency, no.
3317000	3324000	But it will be anything with in-game purchases that require real money, then yes, there's going to be a warning on it.
3325000	3338000	So that if parents who might actually read a label now and again when they buy their kids a game see on it that there's a potential for their kids to spend money in it, then they might, you know, again, if they pay the fuck attention to the label and what it means, not buy the game.
3339000	3340000	So.
3341000	3343000	Again, if they pay the fuck attention.
3343000	3352000	If. In my opinion, this is not going to be good enough to satisfy the government and we're going to see video games get regulated with this. I think that's where we're headed.
3353000	3361000	It's not going to be like the 90s when the ESRB kind of fixed what the government was looking for and then so the government didn't have to regulate it. That's not going to happen this time.
3362000	3368000	I don't know what the hell's going on with the ESA recently, but this is not good enough. It's not going to fix the problem.
3368000	3377000	Exactly. And it's not a problem that we don't know that these are in games. I mean, granted that they like to sneak that shit in like, oh, hey, we'll show you this event or something.
3378000	3386000	Hey, we'll invite the press out for this like preview event or review event or something like that. And then, oh, ha ha, we suck them in at launch, you know, that type of thing.
3386000	3398000	So there's a little bit of that, but it's not so much that we don't know that they're in the game. It's that they build the games around these loot box systems that it just severely hinders the gameplay experience.
3399000	3407000	It turns what would be a normal game into a purposeful grind because they're trying to get you to buy these loot boxes and it's unnecessary stuff that they had in there.
3407000	3416000	I mean, like the whole, um, it was the Lord of the Rings game that just came out, you know, that didn't need to have all this loot boxes.
3417000	3423000	It was just clearly shoehorned in there. And because of that, they balanced it with that in mind and it ruins the game.
3423000	3435000	Well, the problem I have with this solution is that to just label something with in app purchases or extra stuff for sale or whatever it is, that's like every game has that type of DLC at this point.
3436000	3452000	Just about everything. I can think of very few games that don't have it. So that would mean that the Witcher 3 would have this label as would Star Wars Battlefront 2 when these games handle their expansion stuff very, very differently.
3453000	3459000	So the ESA does not want to use the word gambling. They are afraid of that word gambling and they're trying to dance around that word.
3460000	3465000	But any way you slice it, they're going to have to face that issue head on that loot boxes are gambling.
3466000	3474000	And if they're not willing to do that, the government will. So the ESA needs to go back to the fucking drawing board and, um, pony it up.
3474000	3490000	Like you need to figure out a special type of warning for loot boxes. And I would even so go so far as to say it needs to say, you know, something like cosmetic or non-gameplay affecting loot and gameplay affecting loot.
3491000	3492000	I think it should go so far as to label that.
3493000	3503000	Just not put them in there. Just leave that to the mobile markets. Like I'm paying $60 for your stupid game. You don't need, I don't need to pay you more money on top of that.
3504000	3510000	And you know what? Here's the problem. It's like you talk to these AAA companies or whatever that are putting out these games and it's so ridiculous.
3511000	3515000	If it's going to get to the point where they're just not going to listen, guess who's going to fill the void?
3515000	3527000	All these indie titles that come out that are just, they're fucking sick of it and they're putting out quality games. Pay, you know, spend your money on that shit and not this, oh, it's Star Wars Battlefront.
3528000	3535000	Let's put, let's be honest. When EA took the rights for Star Wars Battlefront, we knew it wasn't going to be like the LucasArts Star Wars Battlefront.
3536000	3543000	It wasn't going to be like that. And after the first one, that should have been just a big signal to people saying, hey, there's no way we're going to get that game back.
3543000	3550000	And this is two times now. What's, when the third one comes out, are people really going to give them the benefit of the doubt? I hope not.
3551000	3559000	William Murderface in chat says, the ESA is an industry lobbying group. That's the problem. It's not a consumer protection agency. True point.
3560000	3567000	SG100Matt in chat says, if the government has to regulate it, then it's all on their hands. They flew too close to the sun and now they're going to ruin it for everyone.
3568000	3578000	DungeonBuster in chat says, as one opposing point, Assassin's Creed Origins model is incredibly benign. Yes, there are microtransactions, but it goes out of its way for them not to be the focus.
3579000	3589000	And they've already given away a lot of free content like the exploration mode. Yeah, I mean, you know, and I think that's up to, you know, reviews, the internet, Twitter, social media,
3589000	3603000	the buzz on a game to kind of help explain like how detrimental are these, you know, MTX, as you abbreviated, the microtransactions that are in the game? How much impact do they really have on the final product?
3604000	3616000	I'm going to tell you this much, like nowadays, you know, with everything that's come out, like I was excited, like back when they first announced Battlefront 2, I was excited about it because I'm like, oh, this single player campaign looks pretty awesome, you know, maybe I'll have to get in on that.
3616000	3627000	And good thing I was just lazy and waited on it. And it was a fucking mess. Like, I'm glad I didn't spend money on that because the single player campaign was just shoddily put together as buggy as fuck.
3628000	3644000	And then they have this microtransaction, you know, loot box bullshit that I don't know, like loot boxes were fun when it was like, hey, this is a reward for like in Overwatch, you know, they do like, oh, hey, it's a reward for leveling up.
3644000	3650000	You get, you know, you get some skins or something like that. And yeah, there's people that pay money because they want certain skins out of there.
3651000	3667000	But I think that seems to me more optional. It's not like it's really shoved in your face, I feel, but, you know, games like this, though, where it's like, oh, hey, we have, you know, stat bonuses for different things that'll help you play better. That's a problem.
3668000	3672000	Well, let's because your next story kind of piggybacks on this a little bit, right, Loki?
3672000	3689000	Yes. So, you know, with this whole loot box talk and everything, you may remember that EA, of course, being kind of the big focus of this with their whole Battlefront 2 game and that kind of brought light to a lot of this.
3690000	3697000	Well, now, you know, of course, they have games on the horizon, you know, with Anthem and then there's the new Battlefield game that's going to be coming out in the fourth quarter.
3697000	3707000	So it's kind of like, what are they going to do to address this issue? So one of their comments, apparently, there is this piece that they're doing talking about the new Battlefield game.
3708000	3718000	And one of the comments is that, you know, no one's going to do any pay-to-win stuff anymore. We didn't take any of that loot box controversy lightly.
3718000	3727000	So they, you know, basically are well aware that they're going to be in the spotlight when it comes out with their next game, which apparently is supposed to be a World War 2 game.
3728000	3736000	So kind of going back again, not a modern Battlefield game, but so maybe it's going to be cosmetic only. We don't really know yet.
3737000	3746000	And I don't think they necessarily know yet. They said, you know, no doubt that they're going to have plans for what they're doing right now, but that's going to change possibly again and may change even one more time by the time they get there.
3746000	3757000	So with this and like, you know, I would just say, caution yourself that EA is, this is what they've been doing with all their games.
3758000	3763000	Don't think that they're going to all of a sudden change and become the good guy. Just let's wait and see what happens.
3764000	3774000	Well, I guess in part of the, like, you know, self-regulation at least, even though the ESA may not be stepping up, the consumers have obviously responded in a very large way.
3774000	3785000	And I think game companies are absolutely recognizing that. So if there is going to be any self-regulation that comes from this, it's going to be consumers that continue to, you know, call companies out on a lot of this.
3786000	3787000	The people demand it.
3788000	3789000	I mean, they may be voting with your wallet.
3790000	3794000	They may dial it back a bit for like Battlefield and stuff, but I don't doubt that they're going to, you know,
3794000	3796000	They're not going to eliminate it completely. No way.
3797000	3805000	All they're going to do is the optics. They're going to try to make it so that the people aren't pissed off about because they make too much money from this type of stuff, which is unfortunate. And that's why they do it.
3806000	3810000	I'd like to give everyone a history lesson. Remember when this country started and we let industries-
3811000	3812000	No, I wasn't here.
3812000	3823000	Sorry. But, you know, in the early days of industry here in America, companies would self-regulate and people would be overworked to the bone.
3824000	3832000	I've brought this one up before the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire where they locked the women inside to work and they burned to death.
3833000	3837000	You know, it's why we now have government involvement.
3838000	3839000	A 40-day work week.
3839000	3846000	Thank you, labor unions. Hello. But it's why we have government regulation on all of this.
3847000	3855000	And I think now with our current government, I don't trust them to be able to tie their own fucking shoes, but that's a different story.
3856000	3866000	I think, though, eventually when we have another responsible leader in this country with responsible people working for said leader, or technically they should work for us,
3866000	3871000	then we're going to see that type of legislation happen.
3872000	3878000	I was just going to say, too, the nice thing about the way the government is set up is that there are the three branches of government and it has the checks and balances.
3879000	3883000	And two of them are completely dysfunctional right now. So thank God for the judicial branch right now.
3884000	3893000	Although, unfortunately, the judicial branch is starting to get stacked up with some of the crazies from the other branches. So, you know, we'll see what happens.
3893000	3906000	But at any rate, you know, it's just, it's people not paying attention to history, too. You know, we know what happens if you leave groups unregulated or, you know, to regulate themselves.
3907000	3915000	They're going to do it in their, our government is doing it in their best interest right now. So, I mean, you need some kind of oversight, I think.
3916000	3931000	All right. Well, moving on to a story about PlayStation Plus. And if you're a PlayStation Plus user, you may be interested to know that PlayStation Plus is going to be basically going away for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.
3932000	3940000	When I say going away, I mean the instant game collection, the downloadable games that you get for free every month. It's going to be going away next March.
3941000	3943000	So you still have a whole year, you know, of games that are going to be coming.
3943000	3946000	So they're just going to stop offering them or they just stop allowing you to access that?
3947000	3956000	No, they just stop offering. So there's not going to be any new games that come out in the program. To be fair, I haven't signed on to the PS3 to grab those games in I don't know how long.
3957000	3958000	Oh, I get those every month.
3959000	3960000	Do you really?
3961000	3962000	Every month I download all of them.
3963000	3964000	Well, how much could possibly be left because how many PlayStation 3 games are they making anymore?
3965000	3969000	They're not making any anymore, but I mean, there's still a ton of back catalog, but that's...
3970000	3971000	True.
3971000	3981000	I grab everything, PlayStation 3 and Vita, because whereas I don't really play those systems, if I wanted to, it's nice to have that option and it's free, so I might as well.
3982000	3987000	Yeah. So anyway, your game saves and the other benefits of PlayStation Plus will stay the same.
3988000	3996000	The only change is that no new PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita games will be added to the PlayStation Plus monthly lineup, games lineup beyond March 8th, 2019.
3997000	3998000	So that was what they said on their blog.
3998000	4003000	The only thing I am kind of disappointed about with that is that they said that they're going to drop it down to just two games a month.
4004000	4012000	And whereas, like, you know, I like a lot of them are cross by, so you may not just get two games a month, you may get like four games a month or something like that with the other cross by stuff.
4013000	4023000	And so that's the only disappointing thing I see, especially when you have, you know, a competing platform with Microsoft that's offering four games a month and all of the games work on their brand new system.
4023000	4027000	So, you know, just saying, Sony, you're disappointing me yet again.
4028000	4038000	Yep. It's interesting. We just got into this conversation a little bit at the end of Bobby's show, but it's interesting how the tables are turning where the consumers are getting a little more frustrated by some of these things that Sony's doing.
4039000	4051000	And especially when it comes to things like backwards compatibility and, you know, what's playable on, you know, what systems versus, you know, Microsoft, who, you know, I think a lot of people are kind of coming around going a lot of the stuff they're doing over there, you know, is pretty, pretty cool.
4051000	4063000	So I still, here's the thing that still bugs me about Microsoft, honestly, the interface and the Xbox one, I still can't stand it. Like, I think the Xbox one is still just like, it's just a noisy interface, in my opinion.
4064000	4073000	And that's like, I know it's such a weird thing to complain about, but like compared to PlayStation, which is pretty slick in comparison, like I really just don't like Xbox.
4074000	4082000	Whatever happens to like those universal apps that they were supposed to be, that was supposed to be the big shit, you know, the, Oh, Hey, you buy an app on your, you know, piece.
4083000	4087000	I mean, they have like some games that support them. I don't like talking about like, you know, non, you know, apps.
4088000	4097000	I think because there haven't been a lot of first party Microsoft titles that have been released after the holiday, we just haven't heard of it, but it'll probably come back when, you know, we see some more stuff at the end of the year coming from Microsoft.
4098000	4101000	I don't know. So like crackdown will probably be one of those titles.
4101000	4111000	Well, not necessarily cracked. I'm talking about like non game apps, like, you know, they're, they had Skype and stuff like they're supposed to be like, Oh yeah, you can develop an app for one platform and you can use it on everything.
4112000	4118000	Got it. That's probably still coming. Cause I know they're still working on the, you know, dashboard updates.
4118000	4125000	I don't know what like, let me put it this way. They're like, they give you context. I remember talking with a Microsoft rep back when I worked at my old job.
4126000	4135000	That was a while ago. And that was like, that was at least 2000. I think it was 2013 is when we were talking to them about that. And they were talking about how that's a big thing.
4136000	4138000	So at this point, I'm assuming that's not coming.
4141000	4142000	Just please look forward to it.
4143000	4150000	Thank you. Who knew after all these understand we're going to finally get name changes on PlayStation. So, I mean, anything's possible eventually, I guess.
4151000	4156000	All right. Anyhow, let's shift gears a little bit. Jamie's got kind of a, kind of the outside the box story tonight, right?
4157000	4168000	I do. Um, it is interesting. You know, when we go to Ikea, we don't think of it as a frightening place except with all the humanity that's there.
4169000	4170000	Well, the lines are pretty frightening sometimes.
4170000	4176000	The lines are. But man, it's all about the cinnamon rolls and everything waiting for you at the end of it.
4177000	4191000	Anyway, there is a horror game that is based off of being trapped in an Ikea. And it is called SCP-3008.
4192000	4206000	And basically, it's based off of a story that was posted on a wiki for SCP Foundation. It's a site that just changes out creepy, super, paranormal, supernatural. Oh, you're trying to get.
4212000	4218000	Can you guys hear that? I was trying to get Mr. Smoosh snoring on the mic. Listen carefully.
4219000	4224000	Oh, I just woke up. I got the mic too close to his face. I hope that came through. It was so cute.
4225000	4226000	He's like, Daddy, what are you doing?
4227000	4229000	Sorry guys. Important stuff.
4230000	4242000	Anyway, this game is like, you're trapped in the Ikea and you have to battle the staff. So you have to barricade yourself against the staff that's trying to kill you.
4242000	4249000	And you get food, which is meatballs, and you have to consume the meatballs to keep your stamina up.
4250000	4260000	So, yeah. So, you're stuck in Ikea fighting.
4261000	4267000	I thought this was like the fantasy most people had as kids was getting locked in the mall and having to fend for yourself in the mall overnight.
4267000	4271000	Wasn't there some movie in the 80s about that too? The guys getting locked in a toy store or something?
4272000	4273000	Anyway.
4274000	4275000	Dawn of the Dead?
4276000	4280000	No, no, no, no. It wasn't that. It was like a rom-com thing in the 80s. Anyway.
4281000	4288000	Let's see. William Murderface in chat says, trapped in the Ikea. The new track by Usher. Wasn't that R. Kelly trapped in the closet?
4289000	4292000	Yeah, but then there was weird owls trapped in the drive-thru.
4293000	4294000	Fair enough.
4295000	4296000	Which was better.
4297000	4301000	It was the only time he's ever been allowed to use a Led Zeppelin lick in any of his music.
4302000	4304000	There's also Chopping Mall, which is another one.
4305000	4306000	Yes, Chopping Mall.
4307000	4312000	Let's see. Siya Tabiri brings up there was an episode of Rugrats where they were trapped in a toy store.
4313000	4319000	I think that's a typical plot from any 80s, 90s, like there's one episode where they get locked in X type of place.
4320000	4326000	So, William Murderface does point out though that trapped in the Ikea would be a great title for a weird owl song.
4327000	4332000	It would. So, you like scary games, Jamie? Are you going to play the Ikea prison game?
4333000	4335000	I probably will. Right now, you can actually download it right now. There's a single player.
4336000	4337000	What's the name of it?
4338000	4342000	It's called SCP-3008.
4343000	4345000	That's a weird name. Is that like a model number or something you would read on a box?
4346000	4349000	Well, it comes from that SCP wiki for the fictional company.
4350000	4357000	There's also another one that's called Home Improvisation that basically just recreates people having to put together Ikea furniture.
4358000	4362000	So, but I'll find the link to it and put it in the chat room for everybody.
4363000	4369000	It's interesting. And you can download it, but they're trying to get on Steam right now.
4370000	4371000	Alright, cool.
4372000	4374000	So, I will copy pasta that thing over.
4375000	4377000	Well, let's head over to Loki with some more news.
4377000	4384000	Yes. So, Red Bull is announcing that they're going to have their own fighting game circuit.
4385000	4388000	So, that's interesting. The Red Bull Conquest.
4389000	4395000	And it's going to be a tour that will travel through, I guess, 15 different cities with qualifying heats.
4396000	4403000	And games featured in the series will be Street Fighter V, Tekken 7, and Guilty Gear Xrd Revision 2.
4403000	4414000	And they said that each city will boast one wearer who will then come back in November to the National Finals which will be held in Washington, D.C.
4415000	4416000	Interesting.
4417000	4419000	What's the prize? What do I get for winning?
4420000	4421000	Red Bull.
4422000	4423000	You get wings.
4424000	4427000	I don't like Red Bull. So, I mean, it's just not my thing.
4428000	4432000	Here's my thing. I used to be, like, in my 20s, I was that guy that would drink, like, Red Bull and vodka.
4433000	4435000	And, like, now I'm like, God, that's a horrible idea.
4436000	4444000	Like, no offense to those of you guys that are using it as your choice of drink, but I'm like, you're taking something that speeds you up while you're taking something that slows you down. That can't be good for you.
4445000	4446000	Then you're medium.
4447000	4449000	That's not, no, no, no. That's not good. That's not good.
4449000	4456000	And I just, you know, remember, I was really sick 10 years ago. Those of you who have been listening to O.L.R. for a long time remember when I was really sick 10 years ago.
4457000	4460000	And so, like, energy drinks a lot of times have stuff in them I'm really not supposed to have.
4461000	4464000	So, coffee, nature's energy drink. That's what I stick with.
4465000	4466000	No offense to Red Bull.
4467000	4468000	So, I was trying to see what you win.
4469000	4475000	I don't really, they haven't really brought that out as far as, okay, here we go, prizes.
4476000	4477000	So, oh, that's kinda lame.
4477000	4478000	Oh, that's kinda lame.
4479000	4480000	Oh, great.
4481000	4491000	No, basically, they said, okay, so one champion prizes each champion on their respective team subject to verification and eligibility will win the following prize package.
4492000	4501000	Five hundred dollars and a trip to the national finals in Washington, D.C., which is in accommodations for four nights, which is about sixteen hundred dollars.
4501000	4510000	Oh, so you get five hundred dollars for winning in your city and you get to go to this grand championship in D.C. where we don't know what the big prize is.
4511000	4515000	Yeah, they don't really say what it is.
4517000	4518000	Okay.
4519000	4520000	You get a thumbs up. Good job.
4521000	4522000	Pat on the ass. Good job. Well done. Alright.
4523000	4526000	Well, I mean, okay, cool. I mean, there's a part of-
4527000	4528000	Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go.
4529000	4530000	Okay, yeah, tournament final prizes.
4531000	4537000	A forty five hundred dollar monetary prize split three ways among the winning teams and then-
4538000	4539000	Okay, so fifteen hundred bucks each.
4540000	4552000	Yeah, they said round trip economy cabin air transportation tickets for their nearest major airport and entry into the Evolution Championship Series Japan 2019.
4553000	4554000	Oh, okay.
4555000	4556000	Oh, so yeah, the airfares to the Japan tournament.
4557000	4558000	Oh, okay.
4558000	4564000	So the approximate retail value of the championship teams prize is twelve thousand dollars.
4565000	4566000	Okay, okay, so alright.
4567000	4571000	Second prize is fifteen hundred dollars, third through six places.
4572000	4574000	Alright, I don't care anymore because I'm not going to be entering anyway.
4575000	4581000	My question is, is it going to be streamed somewhere? Am I going to get to watch this? Is this going to be something that, you know, that's a good way to get the word out these days?
4581000	4587000	You know, we expect things like Overwatch League, like Evo and all these things are streamed online.
4588000	4589000	So should I be able to watch this somewhere? I hope so.
4590000	4591000	I would assume so, yeah.
4592000	4593000	Good way to run some commercials.
4594000	4597000	So they do have the cities that this is going to be taking place in.
4598000	4608000	They said Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Nashville, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Francisco and Seattle.
4609000	4610000	Alright.
4611000	4618000	Well, one more story for you guys before we get to our classic thingy of the week, and that has to do with Final Fantasy XV.
4619000	4624000	I mentioned this was coming up and Loki almost gave it away, but I'm sure some of you have been seeing this on blogs anyway.
4625000	4640000	Sure enough, if you get Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition on Origin, for those of you Origin fans out there, you will, if you order Final Fantasy XV between March 6th and May 1st, you get a Sims themed outfit.
4641000	4644000	Of course, on Steam, they're getting the Half-Life outfit. Remember, that was last week.
4645000	4654000	Well, on EA, you get, you know, Origin, you get EA's outfit, so you get a Sims 4 llama suit and Pumbob. I have no idea what the fuck those are.
4655000	4657000	Pumbob is the green thing over their head.
4658000	4660000	You look like a fucking theme park mascot, is what you look like.
4661000	4663000	Is that like a superhero that's in the Sims game?
4664000	4667000	I don't know, because I just make, I build houses.
4668000	4669000	Did you even really play Sims 4?
4669000	4671000	I did. I built a bunch of houses.
4672000	4673000	I thought you kissed the series off by then.
4674000	4678000	And then I played my people for a little bit, and then I built more houses, because building the houses is the best part.
4679000	4683000	Now, something worth pointing out, because this is a little different from, you know, the Half-Life tie-in.
4684000	4696000	On the reverse, if you already own the Sims 4, you get a special Crown Prince Noctis Lucius Callum outfit for your avatar to celebrate the launch of Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition,
4696000	4701000	so you can dress your character in the Sims up like they are in Final Fantasy XV.
4702000	4707000	Also, you get a decal selection, which just has more stickers for your car, whoopee whoopee doo.
4708000	4710000	So, yeah, check that out if you care.
4711000	4715000	But honestly, there's a ton of costumes in the game. You don't need the stupid llama suit.
4716000	4718000	You don't need the Half-Life suit either, to be fair.
4719000	4721000	I'm gonna razz on both of them. They're both ridiculous and dumb.
4722000	4725000	Speaking of Half-Life, don't buy that new Half-Life mod game that they just released?
4726000	4728000	Is it bad? Oh, it's terrible. No, it's too bad.
4729000	4733000	Well, let's get to a time when there were no outfits that came with games.
4735000	4740000	You know what you got? Palette swaps. It's the classic game of the week.
4741000	4746000	Actually, once a month here at Orange Lounge Radio in 2018, Dark Soccer steps into the game vault and says,
4747000	4750000	Hey, here's a peripheral that you should check out.
4750000	4755000	Now I should point out that over on our Discord at vognetwork.com slash Discord, there was some feedback that, you know,
4756000	4761000	the first two peripherals were kind of a little negative, so we're going a different direction tonight, right, Dark Soccer?
4762000	4766000	Yeah. Well, I planned on doing this one anyway before anyone commented on anything.
4767000	4768000	I actually have a whole fucking list made up.
4769000	4770000	So she was gonna mix it up the whole time.
4771000	4775000	Because you can't have, without the darkness, the light means nothing.
4775000	4781000	There you go. So, and I will say this was pretty cool, but tell us what it is, Dark Soccer. What is the classic?
4782000	4787000	Well, actually, wait, in this YouTube, I could tell you what system it's for pretty easily just from the beginnings of this YouTube, right?
4788000	4791000	Yeah, but I picked this game for a reason for it.
4792000	4793000	Okay, but I have to play this noise.
4800000	4803000	So satisfying. Oh, but wait, did it recognize us?
4804000	4805000	It's PlayStation.
4806000	4809000	I have that actually as a ringtone for my phone.
4810000	4811000	Do you really? I do.
4812000	4813000	That's great. I'm gonna fast forward to the actual music here that you had selected.
4814000	4821000	So we have called it the NEGCON for a while, but it's actually the NEGICON.
4822000	4826000	Because it comes from the word NEGIRU, which means to twist.
4827000	4828000	So it's the NEGICON.
4829000	4832000	Suck it, people who've been calling it the NEGCON, including myself.
4833000	4835000	Did you just tell yourself to suck it?
4836000	4838000	Lollipops, Rob. Lollipops.
4839000	4848000	Anyway, the NEGICON is a PlayStation controller that has a twist mechanism in the middle.
4849000	4855000	So it's got a left half and a right half. The left half has the start button and your D-pad and one of the triggers.
4856000	4858000	And the right half has your four buttons and the other trigger.
4858000	4866000	And the buttons for it were kind of unusual.
4867000	4872000	It removed the L2 and R2 buttons and the select button.
4873000	4882000	And so it has a digital A and B button that replaced some of the other shoulder buttons.
4883000	4886000	So it remapped some of the buttons in a very elaborate way.
4886000	4896000	But the really cool thing about the NEGICON is that you would twist it to steer.
4897000	4905000	And so basically in the center it had these gears that would turn potentiometers.
4906000	4909000	I'm going to double check the definition of a potentiometer.
4909000	4917000	Basically it is a three terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact.
4918000	4922000	So it does adjustable voltage based on how much you're twisting it.
4923000	4934000	Anyway, the pivot, the whole point of having the pivot in there is that it would then act like how you would steer a vehicle.
4934000	4946000	In fact, it was actually made by Namco to replicate the dual lever controls for CyberSled for Playstation.
4947000	4950000	Of course, the game I probably played it predominantly with was Wipeout.
4951000	4953000	It was really fucking good for Wipeout. I mean, let's face it.
4953000	4965000	And it seems really unwieldy, but when you've got it on a racing game, especially something as smooth and fast as that, you get really, really tight control with the NEGICON.
4966000	4970000	The games that could use it were Ridge Racer.
4971000	4979000	Now, Ridge Racer Type 4 also used the Jogcon, which was also something made by Namco, but honestly that was a lot more unwieldy to use.
4979000	4984000	Ah yes, that was what I was thinking when you were saying the NEGICON. I was thinking the Jogcon.
4985000	4989000	The Jogcon is the one with the little steering wheel in the middle of it. It had the thumb pad in the center that you could move it.
4990000	4996000	Which I actually did work and was paid with a copy of R4 with a Jogcon. True story.
4997000	5011000	Anyway, it also worked with Gran Turismo, Motortune, Grand Prix 2, Destruction Derby, Call of McRae Rally, Tokka Touring Cars, Rally Cross, V-Rally, and Pole Position games on the Namco Museum, as well as Ridge Racer 5 for PS2.
5012000	5016000	All the Wipeout series up to Wipeout Fusion supported it.
5017000	5024000	There were also some non-racing games that supported it, including Ace Combat, Tempest X3.
5024000	5034000	Also used the NEGICON, which makes sense because Tempest would use either the dial controller or a trackball.
5035000	5039000	So that kind of makes sense with that, since it's a rotary style game.
5040000	5050000	You could also use it as a standard PS1 controller, but again it had fewer buttons. It was just meant specifically to be used for the racing.
5050000	5058000	It also worked with the ROM memory card librarian and the CD player.
5059000	5071000	It wasn't really, I would say, a good replacement for a standard controller, but it was great for those PS1 games and the few PS2 games that would use it.
5072000	5077000	Gran Turismo 3 and Gran Turismo 4 for PS2 do not support the NEGICON.
5078000	5087000	The reason being because it would actually have a conflict with some of the steering wheels to be able to put the compatibility in there.
5087000	5102000	There are clones, of course. There are a few other ones out there that are okay, but they're of course not great.
5103000	5107000	The two things about them is that they were actually built in three variants.
5107000	5118000	There is the first generation, which is the white NEGICON. The second generation model is very similar, but it has more rectangular shaped shoulder buttons.
5119000	5124000	It was manufactured in China, with the first generation being manufactured in Korea.
5125000	5127000	It also has different components inside.
5128000	5136000	There is a black one that is the third generation model. It was cheaper, but it was never sold outside of Japan.
5137000	5141000	I have a white one and I have a black one. I have a first gen and I have a third gen.
5142000	5147000	I have to say the first gen one really is a lot sturdier and a lot easier to use.
5147000	5166000	It is really just one of my favorite controllers out there. It was actually even said so at the time that it was such a unique design and such a really immersive way to play a game.
5167000	5173000	It is very instinct just to twist it. Once you get the twisting motion.
5173000	5182000	When you watch kids play Mario Kart or even some adults, they lean. That is kind of why you have the actual wheel peripheral.
5183000	5185000	It is not even really a peripheral. It is a piece of plastic that you put the Wiimote in.
5186000	5189000	It really sold like crazy because people loved that tactile response.
5190000	5194000	You twist the right side away from you and you are turning right. You twist the left side away and you are turning left.
5195000	5198000	I remember seeing this controller, but I never really got to it.
5198000	5202000	I almost was going to bring it, but it is in one of our bins.
5203000	5207000	I have a PlayStation with Wipeout hooked up ready to go.
5208000	5210000	It is just something you have to feel to use.
5211000	5215000	I am not going to do one on the Jogcon, but I figured I would mention the Jogcon with it.
5215000	5226000	While the concepts are meant to be very similar things, the Jogcon is almost unwieldy in the size of it.
5227000	5235000	You have the dial in the middle, but it is more like a traditional PlayStation controller that the wheel was tacked onto.
5236000	5238000	While this feels like something completely different.
5238000	5245000	I have to say, I don't enjoy playing Wipeout without a Nejicon.
5246000	5248000	Sorry Neji, Nejido. Twist.
5251000	5252000	Nejicon. Is that it?
5253000	5255000	The controller is the Nejicon.
5256000	5258000	It is pretty cool. I like that pick.
5259000	5260000	So suck it haters.
5261000	5262000	You don't have haters.
5263000	5264000	I don't have haters. I have critics.
5264000	5270000	Hey, every gamer has a voice and we get feedback. There is nothing wrong with feedback.
5271000	5272000	I am the library and you all are reading.
5273000	5276000	Alright, so anyway, we are going to take a break guys.
5277000	5280000	When we come back with more of Orange Knobs Radio, we have more stories for you guys.
5281000	5284000	Including some talk about mods taking over games. Interesting.
5285000	5286000	Mods are awesome.
5287000	5292000	And a brand new handheld retro device that is going to take you all the way back to grade school if you are our age.
5292000	5293000	Maybe earlier if you are not.
5294000	5298000	Anyway, we are going to take a quick break. We will be back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5305000	5307000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight.
5308000	5313000	Episode 721 of our show already in progress for this March the 4th of 2018.
5314000	5316000	For those of you guys listening live just because I see people talking about it in our chat room.
5317000	5319000	We are having some random dropouts here in studio.
5319000	5324000	So, it actually is on our end. It is not on your guys' end. I don't know what is going on.
5325000	5328000	I don't know if that is just a whole Comcast issue or what is happening there.
5329000	5333000	Unfortunately, we are not doing anything out of the ordinary. No extra traffic leaving the house.
5334000	5336000	It might just be a lot of people are on the internet in the neighborhood.
5337000	5338000	Crane games.
5339000	5340000	No, I wasn't playing.
5341000	5343000	Because of that particular movie event that is going on right now, I don't know.
5344000	5345000	So, we will see.
5345000	5350000	So, I just wanted to verify for you guys. It is not just you guys. It is something in studio.
5351000	5353000	Well, when it pings out, it doesn't ping out for very long.
5354000	5357000	Because it still says that we have sent over 72 megabytes so far tonight.
5358000	5359000	Which is customary for when the show is going.
5360000	5362000	But it says that we have only been connected for the last 1 minute and 44 seconds.
5363000	5365000	Which means during the music break it would cut out one more time.
5366000	5370000	That is frustrating. Sorry guys. That is the part of being live. What can you do?
5370000	5376000	So, alright. But anyhow, we are going to push through and keep it going for you faithful folks.
5377000	5381000	One thing I wanted to talk about before we get into gaming news again is speaking of movies.
5382000	5384000	Because that is what a lot of people have on the brain tonight.
5385000	5388000	There was a trailer that came out this week for Wreck-It Ralph 2.
5389000	5390000	Ralph breaks the internet.
5391000	5393000	I think we all loved the first movie.
5394000	5395000	I just got done with the first movie.
5396000	5397000	The first movie is great.
5397000	5400000	Yeah, because we hadn't watched it and then my kids watched like half of it.
5401000	5404000	Actually, I didn't see the end of it because I fell asleep.
5405000	5407000	But they watched it and they liked it.
5408000	5409000	And then my son explained to me what the end was.
5410000	5411000	And I was like, okay, cool.
5412000	5413000	But I liked it. I thought it was good.
5414000	5415000	I liked the trailer too.
5416000	5417000	Did you see the trailer for part 2?
5418000	5419000	It was funny. I laughed.
5420000	5421000	The little bunny with the pancakes, of course.
5422000	5423000	No, no, the kitten gets the milkshake.
5424000	5426000	The bunny gets the pancake.
5427000	5430000	But I love all the memes that are already coming out from that.
5431000	5432000	One of them says, like, my Twitter.
5433000	5434000	And then on the pancakes it says, that gay shit.
5435000	5439000	Somebody pushing the pancakes into the bunny. It's great.
5440000	5441000	I love it.
5442000	5443000	Although I'm a little sad.
5444000	5446000	It looks like they're not really going to be getting into games as much.
5447000	5449000	Because it's internet culture. But yeah, whatever.
5450000	5452000	I want the writers to do the story that's going to be good.
5452000	5459000	Well, the story is supposed to be about them finding a part for a game or something that's broken.
5460000	5464000	And so they're trying to find this part on the internet and all the fun that goes along with that.
5465000	5467000	Actually, more along the lines of gaming and stuff.
5468000	5474000	I did see, and I need to go actually seek these out because I saw it was an advertisement for another YouTube video.
5475000	5478000	But I did see some TV spots for Ready Player One that showed some new stuff that was pretty awesome.
5479000	5481000	You're only like a month away from that, right?
5482000	5483000	Less than a month away. Less than a month.
5484000	5490000	Oh boy. All the movies. And then what? They just bumped up Avengers. What is it? Avengers Infinity War? I don't even.
5491000	5493000	I haven't seen a Marvel movie in so many years.
5494000	5498000	Jamie's going to have to drag me out to see Black Panther. That's the only way I'm ever going to see it.
5499000	5500000	Dan and I were going to go see it, so.
5501000	5507000	Either Jamie has to drag me out to the movie, or on the rare occasion Shane finds a movie that he sees like four times in the theater, he'll drag me out.
5508000	5509000	So that he can see it for like a fifth time.
5509000	5510000	He'll take you to see it, then he'll take me to see it.
5511000	5515000	Yeah. Oh, that's right. He'll take his roommate to see it, then he'll take you to see it, then he'll take me to see it.
5516000	5517000	Call Me By Your Name won Best Screenplay.
5518000	5519000	Oh, did it? I thought Get Out just did.
5520000	5522000	No. It was like Best Adapted Screenplay, I think.
5523000	5524000	Oh, right, because Call Me By Your Name was a book. Get Out was original.
5525000	5526000	And I'm reading the book right now. The book's pretty good.
5527000	5528000	You're right. But it's just an award.
5529000	5532000	See, you can see all the movies. They're all good.
5533000	5536000	Besides, now we can have Oscar-nominated Boss Baby.
5536000	5541000	Exactly. Exactly. That sentence right there is exactly why award shows only mean so much.
5542000	5543000	Have you seen Boss Baby, though?
5544000	5545000	No, I haven't. But I have no interest.
5546000	5547000	I've watched Boss Baby way too many times.
5548000	5549000	And I actually saw it in the theaters.
5550000	5551000	Is it good?
5552000	5553000	It's actually pretty good. It's a silly movie. It's a good movie.
5554000	5558000	It would be a good movie to take to your kids.
5559000	5560000	I bet it was inspired by that meme.
5561000	5562000	What meme?
5563000	5565000	The baby in the tuxedo with the finger in the air.
5566000	5569000	Um, no, not necessarily. It's more about like...
5570000	5573000	I thought maybe the dancing baby, taking it back to Ally McBeal. Like, hello, 1999.
5574000	5581000	It's more like the feelings that an older sibling would go through when they have a younger sibling coming on the way.
5582000	5586000	And how, oh, I feel like, you know, you're giving all the love to the baby and stuff.
5587000	5589000	And it's his imagination and how he interprets everything.
5590000	5592000	Because the baby is bossing them around. That's why he's the boss baby.
5592000	5597000	But then it just spins out in this wildly crazy thing because his imagination is just really wild.
5598000	5599000	Go ahead.
5600000	5601000	It's a cute movie. It's not like...
5602000	5603000	Loki recommends Boss Baby.
5604000	5607000	It's way better than, say, the Emoji Movie or something like that.
5608000	5609000	It's actually not bad.
5610000	5612000	Loki hates Nintendo, loves Boss Baby.
5617000	5619000	That about sums up my opinions, I guess.
5620000	5622000	It looks like Lady Bird didn't win anything.
5623000	5625000	Well, they haven't gotten to Supporting Actress or Director.
5626000	5628000	Yeah, Supporting Actress was, what's her name, in Itanya.
5629000	5632000	Oh, I love her, though. Even though I haven't seen Itanya yet, I love Allison Janney.
5633000	5634000	So it's hard to be mad.
5635000	5636000	But again, it's just an award.
5637000	5638000	Best Animated went to Coco.
5639000	5641000	Okay, fuck these award shows. I want to go back to video games.
5642000	5645000	Loki, what's on your mind with video games? Rapid fire news.
5645000	5653000	So Final Fantasy XV just came out on PC, or I should say it's coming out, and it's already been cracked.
5654000	5659000	Denovo that was in it was cracked four days prior to its release.
5660000	5666000	Why? Because they used the demo, which also had Denovo in it, and they were able to crack it.
5667000	5674000	I heard it was stupid simple, like you just take the demo .exe and you put it on the preload .exe, or the preload files, and that's it.
5675000	5676000	Done. Yeah.
5677000	5685000	Now, if you have the preload files, then you would have bought the game on Origin, unless you went to the dark web, which I would never recommend doing. I don't advocate piracy.
5686000	5690000	Yeah, so basically, all they did was they updated the store page, they confirmed it used Denovo.
5691000	5698000	They asked 3DM, replace DRM-free .exe from demo using the unencrypted Origin preload.
5699000	5703000	Upload it towards sites four days later, or four days before the game comes out.
5705000	5709000	It's kind of, this is why Denovo, it's just not worth it.
5710000	5713000	Why spend the money to have this in your game when it just gets cracked?
5714000	5718000	But this is also why games come out on PC now, months after they do it on console.
5719000	5722000	Because the companies know this is going to happen, hackers are going to hack, this is always going to happen.
5723000	5726000	I don't think it's that big a deal anyways, because it's a port of a game that's been out for a while now.
5727000	5729000	But that's why, that's why PC didn't get it in the first place.
5729000	5737000	Because they knew this was going to happen, but it was also, it's kind of a silly exploit that Square really should have.
5738000	5743000	I mean like, how basic is this? This is a hack even I understand. That ought to tell you something.
5744000	5745000	Yeah.
5746000	5753000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, Monday.
5754000	5765000	So, that's that. And then of course, you know, even though they're going to be getting rid of some of those Vita and Playstation 3 games in 2019, they're not doing it yet.
5766000	5772000	So you can actually look forward to quite a few good games actually coming out in March for Playstation Plus.
5773000	5779000	So with that, on Playstation 4 you get Bloodborne and Ratchet and Clank, which aren't bad at all.
5779000	5786000	Playstation 3 gets Legend of K and Mighty No. 9, which is crossed by the Playstation 4, so we're also getting Mighty No. 9.
5787000	5792000	And the Vita games, which are also crossed by the Playstation 4, Claire the Extended Cut and Bombing Busters.
5793000	5802000	So those are your games. Those are going to be available on March 8th. Or no, no, not March 8th. I think later this week.
5803000	5804000	I'm not sure of the exact date.
5805000	5814000	Alright, well let's talk about TwitchCon because the TwitchCon announcement was made this past week and TwitchCon does not like to use the same city.
5815000	5823000	So they are in yet another new city. This is good news for us though. TwitchCon is going to be in San Jose this year, so that's really not that far. I've done that a little weekend drive there.
5824000	5825000	It's been in San Francisco though?
5825000	5832000	It was in San Francisco the first year, so they went San Francisco, did they go Anaheim? Long Beach? San Jose? Long Beach was last year.
5833000	5835000	So, I want to say Anaheim was one of those years, I might be wrong.
5836000	5839000	Why don't we ever get stuff up here? No one likes Sacramento. This is not metropolitan.
5840000	5844000	Well, it's not, sadly it's just not a big enough city. I mean we are, you know, I have a pal that does...
5845000	5846000	At least we're not literally named Cowtown.
5847000	5854000	I have a pal that does the Sinister Creature Con, which is like the horror movie FX. They're getting Linda Blair in June. That's a pretty big land.
5855000	5861000	They have the guy that played Lurch in the Addams Family and did the Fireman in Twin Peaks is going to be there, so that's pretty cool.
5862000	5866000	And so, yeah, so that convention's here. They were doing Wizard World, but that stopped.
5867000	5875000	SacAnime is kind of a big deal though. I heard Rama talking about SacAnime on his blog, so it happens here and there.
5876000	5877000	I haven't been in years.
5878000	5879000	I haven't either. It's just they have it at a really bad time of year.
5879000	5885000	I was actually kind of thinking that maybe we should reach out again and see about doing a panel.
5886000	5891000	Can't. They do it Labor Day weekend. I'm at Dragon Con. You guys can do one. I fully support it. You guys can do one.
5892000	5894000	I mean, they do two SacAnimes though.
5895000	5901000	Then the other one is usually during MagFest, but I mean, MagFest is kind of iffy for me, so I could do the winner one.
5902000	5907000	But you guys could always do one. Team up. Team up with somebody else. Go talk to the number one gaming podcast in town.
5908000	5914000	See if they want to team up. Do something. I don't know. Go. You never know.
5915000	5919000	It doesn't have to be an OLR panel. Do something on podcasting with some of the other folks.
5919000	5924000	See if SacGamer Game Dev Collective could hook you up with somebody, I'm sure.
5925000	5932000	Yeah, there you go. Think. Think. There you go. Which, by the way, congratulations. Thank God I brought that up because I wanted to give big congratulations to Bree.
5933000	5934000	She made a small human.
5935000	5939000	She had a baby and she did not announce that pregnancy for quite some time.
5940000	5944000	So it was kind of like, you know, and people have their reasons. I'm not going to say that. That's cool.
5944000	5952000	But she only, I think it came up on her Facebook like two months ago, maybe. So I was like, by the way, here comes the baby.
5953000	5954000	Congratulations on making a tiny human.
5955000	5958000	That's right. That's right. Congratulations. Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes.
5959000	5961000	You took that genetic material and you made it something.
5962000	5973000	I turned TwitchCon into baby talk. So back to TwitchCon, October 26th through the 28th at San Jose, California at the San Jose Convention Center, which I guess was recently renovated.
5974000	5983000	We don't know the ticket prices or who is exhibiting or any of that stuff, but hotel rooms already available for TwitchCon. Screw that. I'm going to stay with the Mels.
5984000	5990000	They have an arcade in their garage and they live in San Jose. I'm gonna stay with the Mels. They don't know it yet.
5991000	5999000	Well, here's the thing. Actually, in all seriousness, I don't know if I can go to TwitchCon because that's Halloween weekend. That is a really bad weekend.
6000000	6001000	That's the Halloween weekend.
6001000	6010000	That is the Halloween weekend. And so I know I'm going to have a hosting gig that weekend. So if the show is Friday, I could go on Saturday or Sunday for at least the morning on Sunday.
6011000	6023000	If the show is Saturday, I'm kind of screwed. And also, I think, speaking of big life events, I don't want to blab people's personal business, so I won't say who it is, but I'm pretty sure somebody I know has a very big event, life event that Saturday.
6023000	6028000	So it's like I would have to go to that. If I don't have a show, I would have to go to that before I go to TwitchCon.
6029000	6034000	So this is just a really bad weekend for them to do the Con personally, but I would love to get there maybe at least for a day.
6035000	6041000	I would seriously think about not doing OLR so I could go Sunday if there's compelling content on the Sunday. We'll have to see.
6042000	6048000	So anyway, we'll see. We'll see. That is TwitchCon 2018. A little closer to us than San Jose.
6048000	6058000	I should say though, I keep saying it's move city to city. Some people on the East Coast getting very frustrated that even though it is moving city to city, it's always California, right?
6059000	6068000	This will be the fourth year and they've done four California cities. So the East Coast Twitch contingent is getting a little, come on guys, when do we get one on the East Coast?
6068000	6079000	Now Twitch is based on the West Coast. So it's kind of like the same thing with the Sony experience. You know, the furthest East they've gone is Vegas, which is, you know, not that far.
6080000	6091000	Not really that far. It's just one state over and barely. So we'll see. Anyway, moving on to Bobby saying I have to think about TwitchCon because I'm an affiliate now and I can take your money.
6091000	6096000	That's right. I subscribed to Bobby Lockwolf over on Twitch, threw him my prime subscription.
6097000	6098000	Subscription?
6099000	6106000	I need to start broadcasting. Problem is like, I don't have any gear to do it and I just don't really have any place to do it either because the house is too small.
6107000	6109000	Well, if you can figure all that out, get on it. I support you. You know that.
6110000	6114000	I was supposed to start a couple of weeks ago, but then I had that thing that landed me in endoscopy.
6115000	6118000	Do people do that like without like a camera or something like that?
6118000	6126000	Or just like straight up gameplay? I mean, I do. I personally don't find that as engaging, but that's my taste.
6127000	6131000	Whereas other people prefer it when it's just like gameplay without the antics.
6132000	6137000	So it all depends on what your viewers are looking for and what you're looking to provide your viewers.
6138000	6140000	I don't want to be on camera because half the time I'm in my pajamas.
6141000	6143000	No, it's a it's a valid reason.
6144000	6146000	And you know, with my hair and curlers. Not really.
6146000	6150000	So anyway, TwitchCon coming up in October. All right.
6151000	6158000	The fan game in the Mega Man series, not official from Capcom, but a fan game called Mega Man Arena,
6159000	6163000	which lets you fight as Mega Man and the Robot Masters. Wasn't this an arcade game years ago?
6164000	6167000	Yeah, they had a Mega Man fighting game.
6168000	6170000	Well, anyway, they totally kind of like redid this.
6170000	6178000	So what happened is that they did Mega Man Arena, where you take Mega Man and classic Robot Masters from Mega Man 2,
6179000	6184000	and it's a Smash Brothers style game. So it has 8-bit style graphics and you try to drain opponent's life bar.
6185000	6187000	You're not trying to blast him off the stage or anything like that.
6188000	6191000	There's also a boss mode where you, you know, just kind of go against everything at once.
6192000	6195000	Anyway, it's available for free over on the official website, MegaManArena.com.
6195000	6204000	But the clock is ticking till the NDA. However, it should be pointed out, Capcom kind of seems to not be as bad with this
6205000	6209000	as Nintendo does or Square Enix when it comes to the instant takedown of this stuff.
6210000	6215000	One fan featured game was actually featured on the Capcom Unity blog. Was that the Mega Man Street Fighter thing?
6216000	6217000	It was.
6218000	6219000	Yeah, I didn't even click on the link. Yeah, it was the Mega Man Street Fighter thing.
6220000	6222000	But that was two Capcom products coming together. It was kind of cool.
6222000	6231000	So anyway, it's very likely the Capcom won't take it down, but at the same time, once it's on the internet, it is always on the internet.
6232000	6234000	So go check that out if you're into Mega Man fighting games.
6235000	6237000	DarkSakura, how about your rapid fire news?
6238000	6244000	Eh, I got some stuff. So, on one of these, hold on, why did it not link my story?
6245000	6247000	I don't know. Why?
6247000	6248000	Geez, Rab.
6251000	6258000	Okay, so anyway, Detroit becomes human. Remember, we had begun talking about that for a while.
6259000	6266000	Well, it is getting a release date on May 25th, and we'll see how it turns out.
6267000	6273000	I definitely want to check this out. It's the first PlayStation game I've been really, really excited for that's unique to PlayStation in a while.
6273000	6279000	It's the heavy rain and those guys that are doing this, and it looked really cool from some of the E3 stuff.
6280000	6282000	Please don't suck. Please don't suck.
6283000	6292000	Also, Oshimanato, who created Sonic, said he was originally going to have Sonic be a human boy.
6293000	6299000	And then they decided to make him a hedgehog. Although one of these drawings also looks like a bunny cartoon from the 1930s.
6299000	6307000	So, yeah, the first design was a human boy. And then he became a hedgehog.
6308000	6310000	Can you imagine if Sonic was a real boy?
6311000	6312000	No.
6313000	6318000	It would be weird. Sonic's forever a hedgehog. If Sonic was a boy, Sonic would have turned out like one of his shitty friends.
6319000	6322000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
6323000	6324000	At least he's not a racist meme.
6325000	6326000	Correct, he is not.
6327000	6328000	Like the Knuckles one.
6329000	6330000	You're showing the way.
6331000	6334000	Please no. Alright, moving on to release dates.
6335000	6338000	This week we have Bravo Team coming out on PlayStation 4.
6339000	6343000	Fear Effect Sedna on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6344000	6348000	Final Fantasy XV, the newly cracked edition on PC.
6349000	6351000	Frantics on PlayStation 4.
6352000	6355000	Scribblenauts Showdown on Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6355000	6362000	Warhammer Vermitide 2. Yeah, Vermitide 2. That's on PC.
6363000	6370000	Your four night princess's training story on the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Vita.
6371000	6372000	And that's it.
6373000	6377000	Alright, let's, if we could, could we go to the UK? Because my dates are taking forever to come up here.
6378000	6382000	I'm trying to unsubscribe from this one thing that we get a bunch of spam from, so, sorry.
6382000	6395000	Uh, sure. So, oh god, let me delete it. Alright, so, um, oh look, um, more spam that I thought was real.
6396000	6397000	I got it.
6398000	6399000	Are you gonna do the UK releases?
6400000	6405000	No, I had it in my head that I was doing the email and not the UK releases, so sorry.
6405000	6419000	Um, anyway, um, on March 6th, Super Seducer for Mac, PS4, PC, yeah, and then Domiverse on PC.
6420000	6422000	Just sounds like a very hot weekend, or hot day.
6423000	6426000	On the 7th, we have Stare in Den Binary Stars.
6427000	6432000	And on 8th, we have Scribblenauts Showdown for Xbox One. That's it.
6432000	6434000	Alright, now I can go to Japan.
6435000	6436000	Yeah, I'm sorry about all the junk mail.
6437000	6444000	That's alright, here we go. Um, on the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week, the Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition also begins way in Japan, so it's...
6445000	6446000	Royal Edition.
6447000	6449000	A Royale with Cheese Edition? Alright, coming out in Japan this week.
6450000	6452000	Uh, and then, uh, let's see, what else is in Japan this week?
6452000	6459000	On the 8th, uh, Hokuto Ga Gotoku in, uh, Premium Edition comes out in Japan this week.
6460000	6466000	As well as a game called, uh, Anata no Shikihime Kaiyukikutan comes out.
6467000	6470000	And that is also, uh, that's from Nippon Ichi on the PlayStation 4.
6471000	6473000	It's got little anime girls, one of them's dressed like a witch.
6474000	6475000	I'm sure that'll be a ton of fun.
6476000	6478000	Is Mr. Smoosh getting into trouble over there?
6479000	6480000	He just turned on your Xbox.
6480000	6481000	No, he just stepped on the remote.
6482000	6484000	If you stepped on the remote, nothing's plugged in over there, it'll be fine.
6485000	6487000	I'm surprised the batteries in that remote still work.
6488000	6493000	Alright, anyway, also, uh, coming out in Japan, let's see, I'm gonna travel over and see if there's anything on the Nintendo Switch this week.
6494000	6499000	Yeah, um, Anata no Shikihime Kaiyukikutan is also on the Switch this week.
6500000	6507000	Uh, as well as some type of new stand, if you are into peripherals, you can, uh, check out a new stand for your Nintendo Switch.
6507000	6513000	And that is it for releases, so let's go to the mailbag!
6514000	6516000	Every week you guys send us emails, and the spammers do too.
6517000	6520000	Participate at orangelaungereno.com if you want to send us emails.
6521000	6526000	And, uh, Dark Soccer likes to jump into the mailbag and find her favorite emails to read for you right now.
6527000	6528000	All one of them.
6529000	6530000	One email, here we go.
6531000	6532000	Alright, this comes from Robert M.
6532000	6539000	For now, instead of getting the Shovel Knight Treasure Trove, which I will pick up soon, I picked up a game that takes the opposite approach to retro gaming.
6540000	6542000	The remake of the Master System title, Wonder Boy 3 The Dragon's Trap.
6543000	6546000	I presume Jamie is familiar with the original, yes I am.
6547000	6551000	Unless I'm misreading the wiki, only the original Wonder Boy in Monsterland was featured as a classic game of the week.
6552000	6557000	Um, certainly a fun and interesting Metroidvania type game that I can strongly recommend.
6558000	6560000	For the record, Dan has played a shitload of it.
6560000	6564000	I am now familiar with every piece of music in the remix and the original.
6565000	6572000	And we're super happy because, um, this is the only way that on, in the US, you can play the FM soundtrack.
6573000	6583000	Which even if you have, um, because we have an FM power base converter, this should play the tracks, but it will not play, um, uh, the FM tracks, um, for this game.
6584000	6585000	So, just saying.
6585000	6592000	Um, alright, moving forward. Um, I'm almost as late to the whole inappropriate sad ballad trailers things as to Wonder Boy.
6593000	6594000	Not even remotely, actually.
6595000	6602000	But during that discussion, the first thing that comes to mind was sung to some pastiche of, uh, Gary Jules' Mad World, of course.
6603000	6609000	If you see a faded sign by the side of the road that says 15 miles to... funny.
6610000	6611000	Love, sure.
6612000	6614000	Yeah, but imagine that to Mad World.
6615000	6616000	I can't help it.
6617000	6618000	I know.
6618000	6619000	When I hear those lyrics, you just have to.
6620000	6628000	By the way, did you see that there's a trailer for a sequel to The Karate Kid with, um, uh, the Cobra Kai guy, Johnny?
6629000	6630000	Yeah, I saw something about that.
6631000	6634000	Uh, it's people says it looks kind of funny, so.
6635000	6636000	I might have to watch it.
6637000	6642000	Anyway, uh, did you check out the Wonder Boy Dragon's Trap remake yourself, Dar Sakura?
6643000	6644000	It's pretty good.
6645000	6646000	Do you want to take a look from it?
6647000	6648000	It's on Switch and, uh...
6649000	6650000	We would just play in Wonder Girl mode.
6651000	6652000	It's really, like, the fact that you can...
6653000	6654000	Well, we had it on PS4.
6655000	6657000	You can flip between retro and classic so easily is really cool.
6658000	6659000	Like, I wish more remasters kind of did that.
6660000	6661000	It's really cool.
6662000	6663000	We would just, like, flip it.
6664000	6671000	It really gave me a good chance to hear the FM sound, because, you know, again, the only way I could listen to it before was on YouTube.
6672000	6673000	Alright.
6673000	6674000	Well, that's it for emails tonight, then.
6675000	6678000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
6679000	6680000	In the meantime, we have more news to get to.
6681000	6682000	Loki.
6683000	6684000	Alright.
6685000	6686000	So, um, this is...
6687000	6698000	You kind of hear, like, how these games get released, and they're kind of broken and buggy and stuff, and then it's up to modders to save the day and fix the problems that, you know, the publisher won't fix.
6698000	6708000	Well, that was kind of the scenario with a game called Isle 2, Cermavic Clipsover Dover, that was released back in 2011.
6709000	6717000	So it had a lot of problems that modders went ahead and fixed and completely, you know, redid a lot of the game.
6718000	6723000	And so with that, Team Fusion, I guess, was the modding group that kind of worked on that.
6723000	6736000	So this game actually is getting re-released now on Steam officially by the developers 1C, which actually ended up giving the source code over to Team Fusion so that they can finish their work.
6737000	6750000	And now it's this Cliffs of Dover blitz that's going to be free to play if you have the original game, or you can, when you buy it now, it's going to be this updated version.
6750000	6757000	And it fixed a lot of the serious issues of the game and overall improved the performance, which is kind of cool.
6758000	6762000	So now it's just a commercial product and not even a mod anymore. So, interesting.
6763000	6767000	It's kind of neat, especially for such an older game, all things considered, that probably most people have never heard of.
6768000	6769000	I remember selling it!
6770000	6771000	Yeah, right?
6772000	6773000	I remember selling it, yeah. It looked alright at the time.
6774000	6775000	Well, somebody loved it.
6775000	6781000	A lot of people do. I mean, there's not a lot of World War II flight sim games, so it's kind of filling that niche, I guess.
6782000	6785000	That's where you get a lot of your most passionate audiences for the niche games.
6786000	6790000	Look where this show came from, right? Music gaming was kind of a niche thing, and you know, here's the show.
6791000	6792000	So, you know.
6793000	6795000	And out comes Step Mania, filling the void of not having enough songs to play.
6796000	6797000	Yeah, right?
6798000	6799000	And then The Groove, they tried to make money off that.
6800000	6805000	Alright. Let's move on to a new handheld that you can purchase at Target.
6806000	6808000	And yes, this has to do with gaming because it is...
6809000	6810000	Sorry, before I...
6811000	6812000	God damn you. Interrupting me.
6813000	6817000	No, no, no. This is pertinent though. I was at Walmart yesterday, and they had more of the arcade game machines there.
6818000	6819000	Why are you giving Walmart money?
6820000	6821000	Oh! What games now?
6822000	6825000	They had Joust, Rampage...
6826000	6827000	Oh my god.
6827000	6829000	Yeah, they're in color. Joust, Rampage...
6830000	6832000	I didn't even know there was a new series coming out.
6833000	6838000	I think Asteroids might have been one. I don't remember. It was...
6839000	6842000	Well, Jamie, maybe after the show we need to go to the Walmart.
6843000	6844000	That's the fulsome one.
6845000	6846000	Not that I would volunteer to go to Walmart.
6847000	6848000	But they had a ton of them.
6849000	6851000	Under most circumstances. But maybe, Jamie, we need to take a road trip to the Walmart in the middle of nowhere.
6852000	6853000	Okay.
6854000	6855000	And go find these games.
6855000	6858000	I might... Well, I know Dan would want them, so I might go anyway.
6859000	6863000	They had like the Pac-Man stuff, but I know my kids were playing with Joust, which actually was kind of cool.
6864000	6865000	And I checked out Rampage. But yeah.
6866000	6871000	Nice. Alright, well, if you want to go to Target, which is a store, I wish they would sell those out because I prefer Target.
6872000	6876000	But Target does have something cool. It is a handheld Oregon Trail device.
6877000	6878000	Oh my god.
6879000	6880000	Yes, you can play the Oregon Trail on the go.
6881000	6883000	Is that like a .me or one of those old LCD games?
6883000	6888000	Yeah, it looks like an old LCD screen that you can actually use enter to boot it up.
6889000	6891000	I think it is a color screen, though. It actually looks like the old Apple version.
6892000	6897000	And what... I'm sorry, I'm laughing my ass off because on Reddit, somebody posted the first comment on Reddit on this.
6898000	6899000	You ready?
6900000	6902000	This is perfect for when I'm on the toilet with dysentery.
6906000	6908000	Shut the internet down. Somebody won.
6908000	6913000	Alright, well, anyhow, so yeah, it is a color, like it looks like the old PC version or what have you.
6914000	6916000	Somebody actually has video that's online and so forth.
6917000	6924000	Somebody seems to think that it actually might be an NES ROM, like a customized NES on a chip type of ROM that is there.
6925000	6931000	That's what people that are breaking down this device are finding is that it's an NES on a chip that's running this device.
6932000	6933000	Ooh, that could be useful for lots of things.
6933000	6941000	Right? Because they're already trying to figure out how the fuck can I hack this thing to play Mario Brothers on the go or whatever other Nintendo games.
6942000	6944000	So pretty soon, we're gonna get Super Mario Brothers 3 running on the orchestra.
6945000	6953000	Fuck your stupid NES Classic Edition. I'll show you how to ford the river. I'm gonna put on my frog suit in Mario Brothers.
6954000	6957000	Alright. Anyhow, let's move on. DarkSaga.
6957000	6969000	Well, the true name that I do not ever want to mention, so I'll just say Dump, well, had said something about there being a video game summit.
6970000	6973000	Well, no one in the industry knows shit about it, so apparently it's not happening.
6974000	6985000	Yeah, dumb bitch press secretary announced that the asshole wanted to meet with leaders from the video game industry this week to see what they could do on that front.
6985000	6998000	And yeah, no one knows shit about it. The quote is, ESA and our member companies have not received an invitation to meet with, quote, the Dump.
6999000	7004000	Yeah, no one heard shit about it, so apparently more bullshit lies.
7005000	7008000	The White House apparently said the invitations are forthcoming. Whatever.
7009000	7010000	More bullshit lies.
7010000	7017000	The thing that bugs me is that there was, I mean, there's a lot that bugs me about the guy on Twitter that's in office.
7018000	7025000	But that he said, oh, I see my kid playing these games and they're very disturbing. They're very gross and all this stuff.
7026000	7037000	And I'm kind of thinking, well, a parent would have, and you as this boy's dad, bought him that game or allowed him to buy that game without doing any research on it.
7037000	7040000	And so maybe you should take some fucking responsibility.
7041000	7044000	And number one, do you think that creature knows the first thing about fucking responsibility?
7045000	7047000	Nope, but I just, I just wanted to point out that interesting observation.
7048000	7049000	The other game I think is Frogger.
7050000	7052000	Um, I don't remember if it's Frogger, but yeah.
7053000	7062000	Um, so I was going to say that, um, he also made the comment like, yeah, those like movies are violent too.
7063000	7065000	They should have like a rating system for movies.
7066000	7067000	What a fucking dumb piece of shit.
7068000	7069000	This is, this is the person said.
7070000	7075000	And number two, I don't believe for a second that he's spending any time with his son while he's playing video games.
7076000	7078000	Pulleys. He's not on the golf course.
7079000	7081000	He's not there. I mean, he's not spending time with him.
7082000	7085000	I don't believe this verse for a second, unless he's talking about Eric.
7086000	7089000	Which by the way, this shit hole has hit a hundred days at the golf course, just saying.
7090000	7091000	That's a third of the fucking year.
7092000	7102000	So anyway, it's just, you know, video games getting blamed again for something that, you know, people need to take some personal accountability for.
7103000	7104000	Because we're afraid of the NRA, so you know.
7107000	7109000	Anyway, let's move on. Loki.
7110000	7111000	All right.
7111000	7113000	Let's talk about a violent video game. That'll be fun.
7114000	7116000	Let's talk about it. So this is actually kind of cool.
7117000	7120000	So there's a brand new game being done by 3D Realms.
7121000	7128000	And not only is it a brand new game from 3D Realms, it's a brand new game built in, looks like the build engine.
7129000	7134000	So that was the engine that they used to build such wonderful games like Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior.
7135000	7136000	And it's a game called Ion Maiden.
7137000	7142000	And it looks awesome. It looks just like, you know, a game from the 90s.
7143000	7149000	It does look really cool, but one thing I kind of have to read this for, like, it's $17.99.
7150000	7153000	It seems like a little bit of a steep price to pay for the nostalgia look.
7154000	7161000	I mean, but I don't know, I'm a little torn because I understand, you know, you have some talented developers on this, so they deserve to get compensated fairly and so forth.
7161000	7166000	But it just seems like this is kind of a pet project of sorts and $17.99 is a little expensive.
7167000	7170000	But imagine it's one of those things that it's going to come down on price on Steam pretty quickly.
7171000	7173000	I don't know. I think it's worth it for that price. I mean, fair enough.
7174000	7176000	It looks alright. If I didn't have so many games to play.
7177000	7186000	Alright. And last but not least tonight, before we get to the Skype line, I want to talk about the first official building going up at Super Nintendo World.
7187000	7189000	That's right. Pictures have been spotted.
7189000	7190000	Oh my god, it's a giant penis.
7191000	7198000	That's right. No, it's not a giant penis. It just looks like kind of a plain old building, honestly, but it's likely a ride or show building, basically.
7199000	7202000	Like, the Simpsons ride at Universal is in one of these types of buildings.
7203000	7209000	You know, that's just, you know, they don't look that glamorous from the outside, especially the Universal type of rides.
7210000	7211000	They hide it with a facade.
7212000	7213000	The Haunted Mansion? It's not in the Haunted Mansion.
7214000	7217000	That's right. That's right. The Haunted Mansion is not in that actual Haunted Mansion.
7217000	7226000	It is in a building. And you can see the building, but it's, you know, it's a little bit obscured and they have, like, ivy and things on it, but it's a very plain building that's actually behind the Haunted Mansion facade.
7227000	7232000	I mean, think about how gigantic that ride is. It's way too big for that Haunted Mansion that you see on the street.
7233000	7239000	But that's why, think about it. Like, when you're going down the elevator and then you walk down a tunnel, what are you doing?
7240000	7241000	You're walking to the show building.
7242000	7243000	Same thing with Pirates of the Caribbean is a very similar type of thing.
7244000	7245000	Yeah.
7245000	7251000	So, it's probably some type of show building that's going up over at Super Nintendo World. Again, this is Universal Studios in Japan.
7252000	7256000	So, this is becoming a reality. I'm assuming they're still trying to open this.
7257000	7264000	I don't know if it would be by holiday this year, but I know by the Olympics in 2020, but the holidays this year would be a great time to kind of launch something like that. We'll see.
7265000	7273000	I'm very excited. You know, my friend's been trying to get me to go to Japan. This might be the thing that finally breaks me. I gotta go do it. We'll see.
7273000	7275000	I love the good Japan.
7276000	7277000	Yeah, same.
7278000	7287000	So, we are going to open up the Skype line. It is open now. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call, talk about anything we've talked about tonight or perhaps you have another topic you want to bring up.
7288000	7296000	Again, that is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. While we wait for some calls, checking in on any last minute stories tonight. It was kind of a slower Newsweek. I don't know if there's a lot.
7297000	7298000	Yeah, I didn't really have anything.
7298000	7306000	Well, good thing we got a call then. Here we go. We're going to take this call right now as soon as it picks up. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7307000	7308000	Everyone, have a drink. It's Ranma.
7309000	7310000	Hey, Ranma. How you doing?
7311000	7315000	Pretty good, pretty good. I've been spending the last three, four hours editing cosplay photos.
7316000	7319000	Good times. Yeah, I saw you were at a convention. Where did you go?
7320000	7326000	I didn't go to a convention this past weekend, but we're planning to do some moonbounding this weekend, though.
7326000	7327000	Oh, okay.
7328000	7334000	And I'll talk about that on Anime Jam Session next week, because the whole staff's looking forward to that.
7335000	7337000	Very sly plug, I love it. So what's on your mind tonight?
7338000	7339000	What can I say? I learned from you.
7340000	7341000	Haha.
7342000	7348000	Let's talk about this Cheeto. Let's talk about this video game violence thing.
7349000	7350000	Yeah, sure.
7350000	7359000	Let's hop in the car. Let's hop in the DeLorean. Go 88 miles. Go back to 1996.
7360000	7369000	Right about the time when we started getting the ESRB, the Sega ratings, people complaining about violence in video games.
7370000	7379000	I was at the forefront of this, more or less. I wasn't the one buying the games. I was in the game stores.
7380000	7384000	Actually, in a local video store, working there, renting games.
7385000	7390000	Now, we let the kids rent whatever, more or less.
7391000	7401000	But when we saw that things were getting just a wee bit out of hand with some of the games that were coming out for the Super Nintendo, the Genesis, Tomography 16, and so on and so forth.
7401000	7411000	We started instituting policies to make sure that, you know, little Timmy doesn't run around with a copy, doesn't walk out with a copy of Doom.
7412000	7416000	So pretty much, the parents would allow the kids to have their own membership card.
7417000	7426000	And we were looking up in the system what games they were allowed to play based on the recommendation of us, the parent, or the rating system.
7426000	7433000	And there have been times kids have come in wanting to rent, let's say, Mortal Kombat 2.
7434000	7439000	And we pull it up on the account and it says they're not allowed to rent Mortal Kombat 2.
7440000	7448000	And we look at them like, are you sure? And sometimes the child would say, yes, my mom said it was okay. Here is a note. This S actually happened.
7449000	7453000	It shows up with a note saying, I give my son permission to rent Mortal Kombat 2.
7453000	7455000	I love the note.
7456000	7464000	As do I. So, since this was on my shift and I, you know, I didn't want to lose, I didn't want to get in trouble.
7465000	7473000	So, I went, you know, wait right here. Pick up the phone. And I called the parent just to make sure.
7473000	7483000	Now, I'm standing right there on the phone, calling the parent, and the kids on the other side, you probably thought I was going to call his bluff or something.
7484000	7488000	So, I asked the parent, oh, your child is here wanting to rent Mortal Kombat 2.
7489000	7496000	It says on the account, the child is not allowed to, but there is a letter here that says you give him permission with your signature.
7497000	7500000	Why don't you take a wild guess what happened next?
7500000	7504000	Um, I don't know. Tell me.
7505000	7507000	It was a forgery.
7508000	7509000	Of course it was.
7510000	7519000	Yes. So, the parent said, you know, hold on. 15 minutes later, it was a show for everybody in the video store that day.
7520000	7527000	Because the parent came in, pissed off, angry, yelled at the child, said child caught the belt, and that was it, and that was that.
7527000	7539000	Yeah, I mean, no matter what they do to try to, like, regulate ratings and things like that, there's always going to be ways that people work around it.
7540000	7549000	Like, you know, you remember probably when the whole, like, Supreme Court turned down the thing in California where they were going to forbid the sale of violent video games.
7549000	7559000	And the problem with it was that, you know, we already have a regulating body, and it was too nebulous about what is a violent video game, and it just, you know, it was prime for exploitation.
7560000	7564000	But let's imagine in some sick sad world that actually did become law, people would have found ways around that.
7565000	7573000	And that's why it's so important for people like the president to actually be taking an active role and participate in what their kids are consuming.
7573000	7579000	And that's what needs to happen, because all these laws, all these other things, people are going to find ways around it.
7580000	7587000	And, you know, the story you're talking about in this story may have, you know, caught the kid and laughed, but the reality is, there's other stores that don't give a shit.
7588000	7592000	So if a kid really wants, and word's going to get out, which stores don't give a shit, so if a kid really wants a game, they're going to get it.
7592000	7608000	Exactly. I mean, I give the Cheeto points for saying something, but he loses those points because it's like, yeah, we kind of did this like 20 years ago. You might want to put on a new Rolex, sir.
7613000	7616000	You might just want to jump off a bridge.
7617000	7618000	Alright.
7618000	7623000	We don't want to violate the sanctity of that bridge. Good people go to work on that bridge.
7624000	7627000	Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners today?
7628000	7635000	No, that's it, except for the fact that I finally got rid of my coffee table. I've been complaining about it for like the last three months.
7636000	7637000	Rest in peace, coffee table.
7638000	7639000	Yes, indeed.
7640000	7641000	Alright, take care, my friend.
7642000	7643000	You too.
7644000	7646000	Dungeonbuster in chat over at live.vognetware.com says,
7647000	7652000	We carted kids, but it didn't matter when they brought back their parent who bought the game themselves just to get back to what they were doing.
7653000	7662000	Well, those are the parents who aren't really taking an active role, and then when those parents are the ones that are shocked and awed all of a sudden at what their kids are playing, they kind of need to take some responsibility.
7663000	7664000	William Murderface in chat says,
7665000	7674000	They will, yes, but I would be less concerned about that than I would companies manipulating vulnerable groups purposely than I would consumers skirting age restrictions.
7675000	7676000	Alright.
7677000	7678000	Oh, I was going to grab that call that hung up.
7679000	7683000	So, OrangeHondredo, all one word on Skype if you want to get in. I think I see it now, so let's get to it.
7684000	7686000	Hi, you're on OrangeHondredo. Who's this?
7687000	7688000	Hey, this is Ragingator.
7689000	7690000	Hey, Ragingator. What's up, buddy?
7690000	7699000	Now, hold on. I just want to take an issue with something you had said just prior to taking Rama's call.
7700000	7706000	You were covering the story about that you built it in the game Iron Maiden.
7707000	7708000	Yeah.
7709000	7714000	You were saying that $17.99 was too expensive for that game.
7715000	7729000	It seems a little high, but alright. I understand that talent needs to be compensated, but I just kind of go, I love my classic shooters. Do I love them that much? I don't know, but what's your take?
7729000	7751000	Well, here's the thing. Now, not to sound like we're all old geezers or anything, but if you excuse my language, motherfucker, do you remember buying the N64 or the Super Nintendo and getting games like Killer Instinct or any of the Final Fantasy games or anything like that?
7752000	7756000	We were paying like $60, $70, $80 bucks for a game. By comparison...
7756000	7768000	Yes, but that was also the newest and greatest technology that was on a cartridge and not something that was downloadable in a store, which I just paid $9.99 for Duke Nukem 3D not that long ago.
7769000	7785000	Well, my take is considering that we were paying all that money for games like that, $20 or $18 or just shy thereof seems like a freaking steal.
7785000	7801000	Granted, you can't buy Iron Maiden and GameStopper or anything like that, but in theory, if you could, I'll take my $18, slam it down on the counter and say take my fucking money.
7802000	7819000	Here's the thing. Here's the other thing. I get your point. It's cool. And you know, I do understand that, you know, okay, I did buy a game on the Switch just this last week for maybe $14.99 that I'd already owned on PC that I got in a bundle, but I like this game so much, I wanted to get it on Switch as well.
7819000	7835000	So I think maybe what it comes down to is that the genre, the type of game it is, a lot of that comes into play too. So would there be games I'd pay $17.99 for? Absolutely. Is a throwback shooter from the 90s one of them? I don't know.
7835000	7843000	I don't know. Maybe I need to know a little more about the game, see what the multiplayer community looks like. You know, that might be something that sells me because multiplayer in Duke Nukem was a lot of fun.
7844000	7853000	So maybe there's some more factors I need to know about. Is it something that jumps out as, oh, I want to buy this for $17? No. When it goes on sale for $10? Maybe.
7854000	7872000	Now, here's another thing. You know, this game uses a relatively old engine. It has old school graphics. In the same vein as Duke Nukem 3D and whatnot.
7872000	7888000	Now, it may not necessarily be high def and have the latest, greatest graphics and all that, but the way I look at it is, it's not so much how the game looks as it is what's more important.
7889000	7904000	How does it play? Is the game fun? If the answer is yes, I'll buy it. I may not necessarily have the money right here and now to buy the game, but sure enough, as soon as I get the money, I will buy the game.
7904000	7918000	Now, if the game is total crap, it doesn't matter what the graphics look like. No, I won't touch it, you know. Sorry, getting a little tongue-tied here.
7919000	7928000	But so long as it's fun, it doesn't matter what the graphics are. It could be Zork and have no graphics whatsoever. If it's fun, I'll buy it, you know.
7928000	7942000	Alright, fair enough. I mean, at the end of the day, you know, it's about what you're into and if, you know, the price isn't a problem for you, go for it, but don't steal it. I think we at least agree on that. Don't steal it.
7942000	7958000	Exactly. You know, all this comes from someone that is always hyping deals and sales and all that and even I would be willing to pay 17, 18 bucks for this game.
7958000	7960000	Alright.
7989000	8009000	So, you know, not now, obviously, you're doing a show and you want people to be listening and I don't know if you're going to be streaming immediately after ORNs, but if not, you know, people want to check out the video by all means do.
8009000	8017000	You know, the only thing you'll be able to see the game in action and, you know, make a solemn judgment based on that, so.
8019000	8024000	Alright. Well, Rachel, I'm going to let you go so we can take more calls, but thank you for the call.
8025000	8026000	Sure. Have a nice night.
8026000	8027000	Alright, you too. Take care.
8028000	8042000	Uh, Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call. What games are you going to pay a lot of money for? I see some talk in chat about the Secret of Mana remake and that Eric RPG in chat says the Secret of Mana remake isn't worth $40 at least.
8042000	8055000	And William Murderface says, I've also heard that $40 for a remake is generally too much anyway. Yeah, the Secret of Mana remake. I mean, there's things I like about it, but some things about, you know, there are some bugs and it doesn't exactly play like the old one.
8055000	8072000	So it does have some issues of its own and it's, it's too bad because there was a lot to look forward to about that. But I think, I think whoever was developing a lot of squares mobile ports, I think kind of did that Secret of Mana remake and it kind of shows that it's, they took some mobile steps with that. So, um, kind of a bummer.
8072000	8098000	There's still some things I like about it though, but yeah, 40 bucks was probably a little much to drop on that. So, uh, William Murderface though does point out in chat though, I'd probably pay 40 for a PC version of Kingdom Hearts 1.5 and 2.5, but that has so many remakes. So, uh, and Rama in chat says, I'm still getting the Secret of Mana remake. That game got me through a very, very bad time in my teenage years. Also getting a Super Nintendo classic is futile now.
8098000	8113000	Well, yeah, if Secret of Mana was the game that you were really looking forward to on there, then I suppose, you know, if the remake is going to do it for you, but there's still something to be said about the original and the other games on the Super Nintendo classic. But I understand those things are also just kind of a pain in the ass to get. So there is that.
8113000	8116000	Um, any other stories that anybody in here wants to bring up?
8116000	8118000	No, I didn't have anything. I looked.
8119000	8134000	All right. All right. Well, I think we're at that point where we're about to wrap things up, but, um, I really want to thank you guys for listening tonight, especially those of you that were here live. I have a great appreciation for you podcast folks too, but I know with the Oscars going on tonight, uh, there was a lot to distract people.
8134000	8142000	So I really want to thank those of you that took the time out to be here live. I really, really appreciate it. So, um, Jamie about say something?
8142000	8147000	Well, it's an Oscar thing. Rita Moreno. Pretty cool. She won, wore the same dress.
8147000	8148000	I heard about that. Yeah.
8148000	8151000	Yeah. That she wore in 1962 and she won an Oscar for West Side Story.
8151000	8160000	Yeah. That's cool. You can kind of come back and do that. All right. Anyway, uh, as I say at the end of every show, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
8160000	8167000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but, uh, if the voices aren't here to air them, then, uh, what do we do?
8167000	8180000	So, uh, we need you guys to help us spread the word. And, uh, if, uh, you, um, wouldn't mind leaving a five star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play or whatever it is you found this podcast, that would be awesome.
8180000	8184000	Otherwise, let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought tonight.
8184000	8192000	Uh, my final thought is I need to get my DVR machine cleaned as quick as possible so I can actually be able to play on the full thing.
8192000	8203000	Um, my final thought tonight is, um, food. Yay. Alan just walked in the door. Exciting. And Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.
8203000	8209000	Today, I saw a drag queen turn from a Greek goddess into Wonder Woman.
8209000	8220000	And on that note, we will see you back here in seven days. Thank you so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and participating with us tonight. We'll see you next time. Bye.
