00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
This week, the gaming industry once relied on console and feature exclusivity, but more and more staples are opening their doors to competitors in order to reach a wider audience.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
With obvious pros, this change can also bring cons. We'll tell you about this and more, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
Tonight, episode number 722 for this, March the 11th of 2018.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you in studio to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
And typically, I would be joined by the one and only Jamie Summers, or DarkSakura.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
However, she is not here tonight. She got pretty sick after a day trip yesterday, so I hope she is feeling better.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
I understand she was kind of up all night and not feeling so great, so I did check in with her about an hour ago over texting.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
And she's already feeling a lot better, but because she didn't sleep at all last night, she thought she would sit the night out.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
So it's just myself here and Techmaster Loki.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Who needs sleep?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Who needs sleep? You mentioned before you haven't been getting much sleep either.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
No.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
But she's had some medical stuff a couple months ago, so I think it's a little different for her than it is for you or me.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Me, I'm just dealing with the whole Daylight Savings Time thing, which to our live folks, depending on where you live,

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
if you're in Arizona, Hawaii, or maybe another country, we might have shifted our time, our lifetime a little bit,

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
because we had Daylight Savings just happen here, which means it was spring forward.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
It was the anti-share, because usually you get to share that meme that says,

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
If I could turn back time, or don't forget to turn back time, or whatever that thing is, right?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
That meme that's out there.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
But this is the one where it's actually, you can't, it's not turning back time, it's springing forward time.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
So the share meme doesn't work so well.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
But that also means everybody loses an hour of sleep.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
But I'm actually okay with it, even though I'm a little bit like, oh, I'm disoriented.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
I'm like, wow, it's daylight, we're just starting OLR.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
I'm a little disoriented with all of that. It's still, I really love that it stays lighter longer at night.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
I also love that the sun's not in my eyes on the way to work.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah, that's also a nice benefit as well, right?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
And, you know, it's really good, especially because you all know, we do a lot of location-based gaming.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
You know, we've talked about, you know, Pokemon Go, and Ingress, and some of those other location-based games.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
We'll probably play Harry Potter, and all the new ones too.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
Hell, I'll even try that Ghostbusters thing we talked about a couple weeks ago.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
But it's nicer when it's lighter longer, so that there's more time to actually go outside and play some of those games, you know?

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
You're not, like, creeping around in a park when it's already dark.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
So, yeah, I'm all for daylight savings.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I wish they would just keep it this way all the time.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
But I know they don't want to do that for whatever reason.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Farmers.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
That's right. Darn those farmers.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
And think of the children farmers.

02:59.000 --> 03:11.000
All right. Well, anyhow, we want to go to our chatters because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show over at The Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
And, by the way, speaking of vognetwork.com, our lovely home of the past, oh, gosh, been at least five years.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
We've been here at vognetwork.com.

03:19.000 --> 03:27.000
Did you know, Loki, that this very broadcast we're doing right now is the 1000th live broadcast at vognetwork.com?

03:27.000 --> 03:40.000
If you take every live, every live Bobby show, every live anime jam session, understation live, and any, like, special thing that showed up in there, like, when we did indie arcade and stuff, this would be the 1000th broadcast at vognetwork.com that's live.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
So, cool.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Yeah.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
Yay. I don't know how we commemorate that, but if I had a drink in front of my hand, I would take a sip right now.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
There you go. Here's to you, vognetwork.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
And here's to you our chatters at live.vognetwork.com, where SSG100Matt says, Farmers don't even use it anymore.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
It just annoys everybody. It's just something we haven't taken out. We just haven't, I don't know, gotten rid of it.

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
Bobby Black Wolf says, Florida just passed a law petitioning US Congress to make it Daylight Savings Time all the time in Florida.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah, I heard that that, you know, in order to get rid of Daylight Savings, I guess this is what they'd have to do.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
But this is the right, it's the first time in a very long time I'm saying, Florida's doing it the right way.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Because we want it to be Daylight Savings all the time.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
Just someone tell Trump that Obama loves Daylight Savings and then he'll get rid of it.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
Or that he made that a thing. He'll get rid of it. It's reverse psychology.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
It's something that was passed under Obama.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah, Obama did that. I mean, he doesn't know anything. I mean, he's like, oh crap, we gotta get rid of that.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
No, I got it. I got it. Bobby says, no, no, no, we want to get rid of Standard Time. We like Daylight Savings.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Oh, okay.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
We'll work that out.

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
Well, let's say the Standard Time is like the metric system. And of course, we'll just try to stay away from that because, you know, the metric system made sense and we have to do things our way.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
We'll figure out a way to get the message across.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Let's see, also going to our chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
RageNator wants to know, what bacon-fied food did Loki bring to the studio tonight?

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
I'm dieting, believe it or not. I've been dieting for like a few weeks now, so I didn't bring bacon-fied food.

05:18.000 --> 05:28.000
I've been very good. I have like, say, because I have my fitness guru or whatever the hell that stupid app is that you track your calories in.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
So, I've been doing that for at least three or four weeks now.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Good for you.

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
And down like 10 pounds. So, no, I have a Subway sandwich just because I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat and I know what the calories are of that.

05:40.000 --> 05:49.000
Yeah, as far as fast food goes, like, Subway is really one of your best choices if you cut out, you know, mayonnaise and the beef that has a lot.

05:49.000 --> 05:57.000
I do mayonnaise, but I do the light mayo there because it does save 100 calories. And then I don't really get a ton of stuff on it. It's high in sodium, so that's the only bad thing.

05:57.000 --> 06:05.000
But I was just like, I don't know what I want. Like, I was sitting there like even two hours before I left. I'm like, what the hell am I going to have for dinner?

06:05.000 --> 06:15.000
And it's like, okay, well, I can have tacos or I can have Subway. Those are my options. I was like, well, I don't really want tacos today.

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
It's interesting you talk about the 10-pound landmark because I actually, I also passed, I've been dieting a little longer than you, but I just passed the 10-pound landmark myself.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
My diet's been all about like portion control. Like I've just, I've really been bad about snacking about like, you know, I would sit here during the show with like a bowl of chips and all that stuff.

06:30.000 --> 06:39.000
And I've really kind of cut back on a lot of that. So, um, I've lost 10 pounds doing that, but y'all, Friday at a really bad cheat day.

06:39.000 --> 06:48.000
I had a really bad cheat day Friday. Not only did I make it my one day during the week that I went out to lunch at work and I got Taco Bell and I ate all right at Taco Bell.

06:48.000 --> 06:56.000
Like I didn't eat crazy. Like I just got like a chicken burrito with no sauce. You know, again, it's a lot of times I don't want to rob myself of the stuff I like.

06:56.000 --> 07:07.000
If I'm craving Taco Bell, I'm going to go to fucking Taco Bell. But instead of ordering, you know, steak quesadillas slobbered in sauce and all this stuff, we'll get like, you know, a chicken burrito with no sauce.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
You know, I'll try to cut corners where I can.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah, I've just been cutting out soda except for the Red Bulls.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Oh yeah, no soda, no soda.

07:12.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah, it's mainly no soda. Just, you know, I'll have like a Red Bull almost each day. Not really. It's usually been like the smaller ones.

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
I got a larger one today cause like I was telling Rob, I've been up to one in the morning for like the whole week and you know, with daylight savings, I'm like kind of tired.

07:28.000 --> 07:37.000
And I've been with my kids for the whole weekend going to multiple birthday parties. So I'm beat. I need caffeine to wake up.

07:37.000 --> 07:48.000
But normally I've been pretty good about it. And like instead of snacking on pretzels and stuff, I've been eating like protein bars and you know, healthier choices if possible.

07:48.000 --> 07:57.000
No fast food except for maybe, you know, occasionally I'll go to Rubio's because they've got, you know, their fish tacos are actually not so bad for you.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Make good choices.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Yes. And DDR.

08:00.000 --> 08:17.000
Well, I mean, I didn't finish my story. I made bad choices on Friday, but this does tie to gaming because some of my Ingress buddies, including some of the people you heard here on the show, you know, back in January, wanted to get together because, you know, sometimes like the group in Ingress, like we all generally, I think anyway, we all kind of like each other, you know.

08:17.000 --> 08:29.000
And, you know, I've made friends through that game and so forth. So some folks suggested, hey, there's a food truck festival over at the park in East Sacramento. Let's go to the food truck festival and then we'll, you know, eat some food.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
And then we'll, there's a ton of portals right there because it's a park and then we'll do like a farm and it'll be like a night thing.

08:34.000 --> 08:43.000
So, so we did. I went to the food truck festival. Oh my God, I bad because they have Buckhorn barbecue and I have a big weakness for their tri-tip. It's really good.

08:43.000 --> 08:54.000
So I ate that and then it was like, well, I got to see what these local food trucks have and it was ice cream. Loki, I got like this big old waffle cone with ice cream and it was peppermint sauce and crushed Andes mints.

08:54.000 --> 09:06.000
It was so flippin' good. But needless to say, when it came to my weigh in today, I'd gained two of my two pounds back that I'd lost midweek.

09:06.000 --> 09:15.000
So whoops, I had a little bit of a setback, but you know, that's all right. I'll make better choices moving forward. And the important part is I had a really good time Friday night.

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
So, you know, cause then after we farmed, it was like some of us splintered off. We're like, let's go smash all the blue on the grid cause we're right here. Let's go. So, you know, we had a good time.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
So, um, but yeah, it was, it wasn't my best diet choices.

09:27.000 --> 09:36.000
Well, yeah. And I am going to get into the bacon stuff at some point. I do want to get back on, like, cause I wanted to go on like the keto diet, but that requires me to do a lot of food planning.

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
Like right now it's kind of like on a whim, like here's what I've got, you know, and what do I want for lunch? I don't know, you know, let's pick something.

09:43.000 --> 09:53.000
Um, you know, so like basically breakfast has always been like a yogurt and like, um, like a granola bar or something like that.

09:53.000 --> 10:02.000
And then lunch is usually whatever's nearby. So I'll do either like a six inch sub at Subway, you know, that's like only 300 calories or something.

10:02.000 --> 10:10.000
And then, or like a talk, a couple tacos from Rubio's, which actually aren't that many calories. So I get those.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
Um, and then dinner, usually I will skip dinner or like just have something very light. So I don't feel like I'm going to pass out.

10:17.000 --> 10:25.000
But I've been like even under like, cause I have my goal in the app to lose a pound a week, but I've been way under that on calorie wise.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
Uh, so anyway, it didn't mean to make this a diet show, but it's just something I think we're all kind of going through right now here at OLR.

10:31.000 --> 10:38.000
And, uh, you know, it does kind of tie to gaming. Cause if you're, if you're playing a lot of video games, you're kind of looking at yourself going, I got, I got a little bigger.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
Exactly. Yeah, I have to do, you know, again, I'm not a doctor disclaimer, but just try making better choices.

10:44.000 --> 10:55.000
Like don't take the bag of Doritos with you to the couch when you play a video game or watch Netflix instead, you know, leave it in the kitchen or take some carrots or celery.

10:55.000 --> 11:04.000
Even though I know that sounds super lame, but you don't even like, even if you don't want to do the dieting stuff, like just at least track your calories and be honest with what you're eating.

11:04.000 --> 11:12.000
Yeah. And just see how much like you're, you'll be like, Holy crap. You know, like just make a little adjustments. You don't have to like sometimes when people diet and maybe, and that's what works for some people.

11:12.000 --> 11:20.000
Again, I'm not here to tell you what works for you, but, but I know for me, like I can't do this radical fucking shift where it's like, I'm going to go on Atkins.

11:20.000 --> 11:31.000
I'm just picking on salad every day. Yeah, no, that's not going to work for me. I can't do a radical change, but I can go, Hmm, where could I make some improvements?

11:31.000 --> 11:38.000
What like little things could I adjust? Maybe something this week and something next week that would help and, and so far knock on wood. So good. So good.

11:38.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah. So like I started, like I started with, I was still going fast food, but I was, instead of getting a large, I get like, you know, the regular size and like get, you know, a smaller soda and start with that.

11:50.000 --> 11:58.000
Or, you know, then I got it without soda and I stopped going the fast food and I, you know, just cut down the calories and cut down what I'm eating.

11:58.000 --> 12:07.000
And then eventually it's just like, okay, I want to do diet and exercise. So it was just mainly portion control and now tracking calories, you know, watching how much everything costs.

12:07.000 --> 12:17.000
It's like, you know, I don't have enough to go there. Like if I went, like we went to birthday parties this week, so I was like, okay, I can only have one slice of pizza instead of I'm going to eat as much pizza as I can.

12:17.000 --> 12:26.000
You know, I'm going to drink tons of soda. It was like, okay, I can't really afford to eat that slice of pizza. I'll just eat this one and no soda.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Pizza at those places sucks anyway.

12:29.000 --> 12:36.000
Yes, I've had pizza at Chuck E. Cheese and pizza at some other like place and it's not, it's not terrible.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
All right, let's, let's wrap up this topic. I do want to just quickly say that to tie it back to gaming.

12:40.000 --> 12:46.000
Dar Tetsuya says, I can't speak for my diet, but I did start playing DDR semi-regularly again. There you go. Exercise gaming.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Exactly.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
There you go. And that's a DDR with your machine has been a big part of what you're doing too, right?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Exactly. I've been playing lots of DDR.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
That's what I need. I need a DDR machine.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
Alan, you out there? I need a DDR machine. All right, let's get into gaming news.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Kickoff topic tonight before we get to our gaming weeks.

13:02.000 --> 13:08.000
Look, I know everybody out there probably already heard about this, the Nintendo Direct that happened this week.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And let's just, let's just skip to it.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
Look, I know people that seek out gaming podcasts, you probably have some awareness of what's going on in gaming already.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
If somehow you've missed it, if you're not on social media, somehow you've missed it.

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
By the way, Nintendo dropped a little bit of a bombshell at the end of their Direct that they confirmed Super Smash Brothers for the Nintendo Switch.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
It's happening and it's happening in 2018 per the trailer.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
And a pretty clever little reveal they did.

13:35.000 --> 13:42.000
You know, they made it look like a Splatoon trailer at the beginning, which was funny because it came right on the heels of a bunch of Splatoon announcements.

13:42.000 --> 13:49.000
So for me personally, I was like, oh, this is Smash because we've already seen all the Splatoon announcements and they hyped this up as one more thing.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
But I bet there were a lot of people that were thinking, you know, somebody in chat I saw said, oh, maybe it was a Splatoon port for 3DS or something.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Was it the one more thing?

13:57.000 --> 14:03.000
But anyway, of course, in and up, so you have like 30 seconds of the Inkling kids shooting each other.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
Then all of a sudden the lights go out, you know, and then it's like this, the sun is rising and it's a big flame sun.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
It's very intimidating. It's very scary for a Nintendo game.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
And the reflection of the fire sun is in the Inkling girl's eyes.

14:15.000 --> 14:22.000
And sure enough, it's the Smash Brothers logo and then a hint of Shadow Mario, a hint of Breath of the Wild Link,

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
and then a hint of like 20 other silhouettes that YouTubers have analyzed to death about who is in the game already.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
But there you go, Smash Brothers confirmed for 2018, assuming they don't push it back.

14:34.000 --> 14:41.000
But I'm assuming Nintendo must be pretty confident that they're going to make 2018 or they wouldn't have announced it right now.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
So, Logi, Smash Brothers, what'd you think?

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
I don't really play much Smash Brothers. I haven't really played much of my Wii, to be honest.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Really?

14:50.000 --> 14:59.000
My son's really monopolized that, but I mean, I like Smash Brothers and the Wii, but I don't play it like, you know, religiously.

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
With even like a lot of fighting games, it's more of like, you have to be good in order to be able to play this online, you know, that type of thing.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
I think Smash is a fun party game to have.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
It is.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
I like to just have it on hand for when I have people, even though I rarely have people over anymore these days,

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
but when I do have people over, like Smash is one of those things I like to have, you know, it's a great party game.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
And it's really easy to kind of pick up and play, too, especially, you know, support so many different types of controllers.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
And I'm assuming with the Switch, you know, every Switch has two controllers by default, right?

15:28.000 --> 15:35.000
So I'm assuming you'll be able to play either with both of them in the dog years, or you'll be able to, you know, pop them out and just play with the controller by itself.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
I'm sure it'll work fine.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
How are we going to plug in GameCube controllers?

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I thought they were already working on something like that for the Switch.

15:42.000 --> 15:49.000
I thought we already saw some type of GameCube adapter thing for the Switch, and that was the big clue that Nintendo was working on a Smash Bros. for Switch.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Of course they were working on a Smash Bros. for Switch. Of course they were going to do it.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
The big question was...

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
Well, I was going to say, going back to Splatoon, I'm surprised they don't have guest characters in Splatoon.

15:59.000 --> 16:05.000
Like, playing as, like, Mario from Mario Sunshine or something like that, or, you know...

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Wait. Anything is possible.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
But the Splatoon kids do seem to be the brand new characters in everything, right?

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Because they were the big new reveal in Mario Kart 8.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I can see it now. They can...

16:15.000 --> 16:22.000
Their ability, they're going to have a unique ability where they can spring ink on the ground and turn into a squid and go really fast and dive through there.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
That's going to be the next fucking E3 thing.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Why not? No, they'll announce more characters at E3.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
They're going to start to confirm some of the...

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
Because now we know that Smash is happening ahead of E3.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
Smash is going to be that Nintendo line that is fucking insane at the booth.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Especially with the public being able to get into E3 now.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Like, if you needed a reason to go to E3 as the public, here you go.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
And they're going to have, like, a Smash Invitational with the new game.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
Have fun in that five hour line, waiting to play Smash Bros. being one of the first.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
But that's where you're going to get your big reveal.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Get in line at Best Buy.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
Maybe. You're right. Maybe if we're lucky, we would see something where the local stores will have a type of demo.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
We don't know. It's a little too far out to be able to say.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf says,

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
Smash is their holiday 2018 tent pole. Yep, looks like it at this point.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
Tigerclaw says, I wouldn't be surprised if Shovel Knight, our characters in the new Smash Bros.,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
they have an amiibo, so it's a given.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
Well, you know who else is getting an amiibo, based on what we saw in the Nintendo Direct, is Dark Souls Dude.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Right? Is getting a Praise the Sun amiibo.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
I would love that stuff in there. They have another Smash-like game that has, I forget what it's called,

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
but they have one that has some of these guest characters in there.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
There was actually a Kickstarter, I think, that had a bunch of these indie games.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
They had the guy from VVV, they had, I think, Shovel Knight was in there,

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
and a bunch of the other guys from a bunch of these other games.

17:50.000 --> 17:57.000
And the Switch has been really heavy on indie stuff, so honestly, the time has never been better for Shovel Knight or Shantae.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
You know, I know there's been a lot of fan cams.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
The time has never been better for those guys to show up in Smash Bros.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
So here's the question a lot of people are asking, and I know some of you believe you have the-

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Or what about Dylan?

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
Hold on. I know some of you believe you have the definitive answer to this based on tweets and so forth,

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
but a lot of people are asking, port or new game? Is it a port or is it a new game?

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
People are suggesting that it's a new game because the logo is slightly different than the one that they had for the Wii U and 3DS.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
I believe it's a new game, and it's nothing to do with that.

18:30.000 --> 18:39.000
I think it's just- I think what it is, it's not going to be necessarily a radical reinvention of the last game, if that makes sense.

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
Like, I think it's going to be very similar to what we saw between Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 1.

18:44.000 --> 18:52.000
Like, Splatoon 2, it's great. I mean, I'm not- it's just- it took a lot of what worked in Splatoon 1 and just kind of refined it and made it better.

18:52.000 --> 18:58.000
And I have a really good, strong feeling that that's where we're at with this new Smash Brothers game, whatever it is.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
It's not necessarily going to be a port, but it's just going to be, you know, they're going to take the formula,

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
and it's going to be very similar, I think, in some ways. I think you'll see a lot of returning stuff.

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
For example, I don't see any reason why they need to cut a single character out of the game.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
Save for maybe some of the third-party stuff, because, you know, I know y'all might think,

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
oh, it's easy because Namco works on the game to get Pac-Man back in the game and all that stuff.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
You know, I-

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Nobody cares about Pac-Man.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
Well, I like playing Pac-Man. Fuck you. I like Championship Edition on Switch right now, too. I was playing that this week.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
So fuck you. Fuck you two times.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
But anyway, I would like for Pac-Man to come back.

19:34.000 --> 19:42.000
But, I mean, I don't think any third-party character is ever a given, but I don't see any reason why all the first-party things won't come right back.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Save for maybe some Pokemon swaps.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
You know, maybe instead of having some dedicated Pokemon characters.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
I think you'll have Pikachu and Jigglypuff. Like, those are the two musts.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
But then everything else, you know, you might see them switch something out for something new. We'll see.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
But I don't see any reason why they'd cut anything. In fact, I would hope they're going to bring Ice Climbers back.

20:03.000 --> 20:10.000
Because now the reason why Ice Climbers didn't happen in the Wii U was because of the 3DS version,

20:10.000 --> 20:16.000
where they were worried about having, like, eight players, this Ice Climber, all at once. It was too much on the system of drain.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
That shouldn't be a problem with the Switch. So I hope Ice Climbers is back.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Shouldn't have been a problem on the 3DS either, but whatever.

20:23.000 --> 20:30.000
But anyway, I'm sure Character Wank is going to make up so many blogs and tweets and other podcasts you listen to.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Like, I don't know what else we could add to that.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
Fine. A tiny little bit of Character Wank. What character would you want to see in the game, Loki?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Reasonably. Realistically.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
Realistically? Like, I've always been saying it. I can't just pick one.

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
Okay, so obscure character that I would like to see in the game, just because the game never came out over here.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
And I feel that it would have been a great game, because it was just so strange.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
It featured a bunch of non-focused on characters.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Like, Captain Rainbow should be in the game.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
But even they have other characters from the Mario games that they just completely forget about nowadays.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Like, Birdo. Put Birdo in the fucking game or something.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
You just named the character that I was going to say. Birdo.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
That's fine. I want to see some Super Mario Brothers 2 love.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Birdo or Wart, I would like to see.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Wart would be good, yeah.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
Wart has been gone forever. What has Wart done?

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
They somehow actually killed Wart.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
They can't seem to make Bowser or any of his children disappear ever.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
But they somehow killed Wart.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
So Mario Brothers 2 love would be on my list.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Or Geno.

21:43.000 --> 21:51.000
Or we could go really obscure and name some of the stuff from Super Mario Land.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
The Game Boy one that was way different than most Mario games.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
So mine is Birdo. Yours is?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
I would say probably Captain Rainbow.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Because it's just a weird character.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I would also take Tingle.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
I think Tingle was an assist, but I would accept Tingle as a full character.

22:12.000 --> 22:21.000
I think though, if we're getting Breath of the Wild Link, how do we not get Linkle?

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
With how popular Linkle has been in the fan community and stuff.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
How do we not get Linkle in the next Smash Brothers?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I kind of think that's a given.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I do like a lot of the gender swap stuff, so they may do that.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Yeah, why not?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
They did with the fire emblem.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
No offense to the fire emblem, but there's way too many fire emblem characters.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I'm totally fine if they cut some of the fire emblem characters.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Sorry guys.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I think if they do cut things.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
Or if they can do one character that's color swaps or something like that.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
The color swaps are different characters.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
I would say the other thing that might be in danger are the Miis.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
And that whole thing.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Because I kind of feel like the emphasis on Switch.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
I know they still exist, but I kind of feel like the emphasis has been taken away from that a little bit.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
So I wouldn't be surprised if the Miis get retired.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
But we'll see. Anything's possible.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
There's really no reason to cut anything, but we'll see.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
We'll see what happens.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I don't want to spend too much time on Smash Brothers Wank.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
But it's everywhere this week.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
People are really excited about this game.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
It brings a lot of the best in Nintendo under one roof.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
It's really easy for anybody to pick up.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
This is why people are excited about it.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
And these games do sell really well.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
I would hope though that we do see some indie support.

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
I do. Because I think the Switch owes a lot of its early success to the indies.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
I would love to see a Rocket League car as an assist.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Obviously they can't be a character.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
But a Rocket League car as an assist I think would be pretty rad.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
And some of the other stuff we name.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Like Shovel Knight, Shantae.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
That would be really crazy as a crossover character.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
Like Steve from Minecraft as a playable character.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
That would be pretty badass if they pull it off.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I don't think they would do it.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I don't know. Microsoft ain't stupid.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
They know how big Smash Brothers is.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
And they don't really see themselves competing with the Switch I don't think.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I would just be cool.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah Minecraft Steve is a character.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
That would be huge if that was announced.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
But I don't know.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
That's not on the plausibility scale.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
That's a little lower.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Right. Exactly.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Alright. Anyway. What else?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
What else, Loki? What else on the Nintendo Direct?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Because there's other stuff too.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
They started off with a lot of 3DS news.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
Of course they have a new Dylan game coming out.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Dylan's Dead Heat Breakers.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
And if you don't remember who Dylan was.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
Dylan was like this Armandillo type game.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
Which I don't understand why he's not a character in Smash Brothers.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Whatever.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
So that's scheduled to be coming out.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
They're remaking Luigi's Mansion for the 3DS.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
In other news that nobody asked for.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Why?

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
Okay. Here's the thing. I'm not trying to hit on the 3DS.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
But I really feel like the 3DS has run its course.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
I get that there's still the loyalists out there for the 3DS.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
You paid good money for it. I understand.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
There's a very rich library on 3DS.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
But, y'all. Pokemon has moved off the 3DS.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
That system's days are numbered.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
I don't understand why we're continuing to crank out 3DS support through 2019.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
And here's my thing.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
If the Switch wasn't also portable, I wouldn't feel so strongly on this.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
But they're redundant.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Those two systems, to me, are now redundant.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Because, okay, sure, the 3DS has two screens.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Big fucking whoop.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
You can have good screen real estate on the Switch at this point as well.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
And the Switch also has a touchscreen.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
It's portable.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
But, to be fair, before somebody says,

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
Rob, you're not considering this, I understand that games aren't developed overnight.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
And Nintendo knew they were taking a risk with the Switch.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
And so they probably had 3DS games in the pipeline for quite some time.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
This is where the Metroid game last year fits into, right?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Because if the Switch had bombed,

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Nintendo would have put so much more stock in that Metroid game.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I mean, not to say they didn't, but you know what I mean.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
They would have really been amped in that Metroid game to drive more 3DS sales.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Because they would have been really investing themselves in that.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
And I think you'd see even more on the 3DS right now.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
But, luckily, the Switch has been a success.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
So I think with that, it's time to focus on the Switch.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
And maybe we don't need a port of a fuckin'...

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
What I kinda think is an overrated GameCube game.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
Sorry, I know Luigi's Mansion has its fans, but...

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
If you're gonna bring something over from the GameCube and the Mario universe,

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
bring Super Mario Sunshine over.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
But put it on the Switch!

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Sorry, Rama, but Luigi's second tier.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Sorry, Rama, but the year of Luigi, it's over.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
It's over.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
Just kidding, but you'll always be my favorite Luigi, Rama, if you're out there somewhere.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
Luigi doesn't have a holiday each year, like Mario does.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
And this is the year of Splatoon.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
What was it? The year of the ink? No.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
What did they say it was? The year of...

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
They didn't say the year of Splatoon. They said the year of the Octokid.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Something like that.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Didn't you catch that towards the end? He was doing a little figure eight.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Oh, forget it.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Yeah, thank you. Act F. The year of the Octolings. That was it.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Yeah, they said that.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
I don't think it's like a...

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
I think it was just more of a tongue-in-cheek comment.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
And then the F-Zero's over here going,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
But what about me?

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
You just got a game like a few years ago.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
It's like, what about me?

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Captain Falcon will be in Smash.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
It's a good standby. There'll be an F-Zero stage that'll make us go,

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Why don't they put the fucking F-Zero on the Switch? God damn it.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
They'll fucking dropkick those inklings in the face.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
Or it'll be really funny because what'll happen is that Captain Falcon will be in there,

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
but the stage will be from Fast Racing Remix.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
And somebody will be like,

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
Oh, I got confused. Sorry, y'all.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Sorry about that.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
They're doing an amiibo for Solera of Astoria,

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
which is from Dark Souls.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
And Dark Souls Remastered, of course, is coming out May 25th on the Switch.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
A series that I super didn't really get into,

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
but I know the series has its fans, so interesting.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
The amiibo thing is really kind of neat,

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
so I guess it really shows that Nintendo wants us to succeed.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
And since Skyrim did so well,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
it probably stands to do pretty well.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker is coming to the Switch,

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
and they're going to have new levels based on Super Mario Odyssey.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
That's coming out on July 13th,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
and they're also doing a port to the 3DS as well.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
This is pretty awesome.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
South Park, the Fractured But Whole is coming to the Switch in April 24th.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
Then they announce, of course, the big expansion for Splatoon 2,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
the Octo expansion.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
So that'll be coming out for $20 this summer.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
And let's see what else.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
Warrior Work Gold, 300 microgames, unfortunately it's on the 3DS.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
Yeah, I was really excited when I saw that announcement

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
until I remembered it was part of the 3DS sizzle reel.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
It's a direct response to multitasking.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
They feel the threat, and so they've got to counter it with, you know,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Warrior Work Gold, so...

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
I think Super Multitasking should be on Switch,

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
but I'm sure Eren would like to sleep at some point.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
But anyway, I think...

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
I'm happy to see that they haven't forgotten WarioWare

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
and that they're still doing a new game.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
And is it just a best of, or is it like they're actually putting new stuff in it too?

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
Because I got the feeling it's simply a best of,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
and they're not really doing new stuff for it.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
But if they do some new stuff, I'll be into it.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I mean, again, I wish it was on the Switch,

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
but I also understand that the Switch is missing a few gimmicky things

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
that the 3DS had, like the microphone input and stuff,

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
so there's some things they kind of have to do on 3DS,

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
but I would have let those things go to have a Switch version,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
but okay, whatever.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
They had to do what they had to do with the resources they have.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
I guess it's better than nothing in WarioWare world.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
They did show that Hyrule Warriors is coming to the Switch in May, May 18th,

30:20.000 --> 30:26.000
and then also they're going to be doing a No More Heroes, Travis Strikes Again game.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I thought of you when I saw that, because I was like,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
oh, Loki probably into that.

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
You know, I haven't really been too much into No More Heroes recently,

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
but I hope that's not the new game that they were talking about,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
like when they were teasing it a while back.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
I hope this is just like a spinoff game, because it didn't look...

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
It looked all right, I guess, but not what I was hoping for.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Okay.

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
Then they have ports, ports, ports, so Kami HD coming to the Switch.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
They talked about the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy also.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
That's kind of a big deal, though.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
The Crash Bandicoot thing, that's kind of a big deal,

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
because I remember, I know not everybody was around in 95, 96

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
when the PlayStation was really starting to take off,

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
but Crash Bandicoot was kind of Sony's mascot for those years for a little bit,

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
and Crash Bandicoot was kind of a real runaway game for the PlayStation,

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
so the fact that it's going over to Switch, that's kind of...

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
And I know we'll talk about it later in the show,

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
but it's not stopping just there with the Switch.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
It's going to show up other places too, but it's still a little surreal.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
It's kind of like when the Sonic game first came out on the Switch.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
That was a little weird.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Right, yeah.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Or, I mean, on a Nintendo platform, excuse me.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
That was a little weird.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Anyway.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
And then, of course, more Undertale coming to Switch.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
They didn't really give a release date just eventually.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
That's kind of neat, though.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Undertale obviously has a huge...

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
I feel like the popularity of that game has kind of dipped down a little bit,

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
but you can't go to a convention and not see somebody make an Undertale reference,

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
so I'm sure people will be excited to check it out on Switch.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
And then Mario and Luigi's Bowser's Inside Story being remade for the 3DS,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
as well as Bowser Jr.'s story.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
That was the one where I really rolled my ass.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Coming out for 2019, it's like... still?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Yeah, that's a little bit of a wait.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
On a port, I was a little bit like,

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
this one might have been a little early to talk about,

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
and all it really says is that Nintendo's committed to the 3DS platform through 2019.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
But why?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Some people are going to be really happy to hear that.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I'm just ready to see them move on.

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
I hope that that port is one of the last things Nintendo's doing for the 3DS,

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
and that they're putting all their energy and effort over on the Switch at this point.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Sounds pretty much it.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
All right. What did you guys think of the Nintendo Direct?

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
Comment over on our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Bobby Black Wolf says,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
you know the 3DS still has legs and is cheaper than the Switch.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
How much longer, though?

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
Because we all know it's going to happen,

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
where they're going to put out some type of Switch amped-up version.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
You know what? I missed out on that whole,

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
they had the thing on eBay for 20% off of everything,

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
so I could have gotten a Switch for like 20% off.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
I didn't even know that was a thing.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
I think I saw somewhere, it was like,

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
you get one for like $220 something for a Switch.

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
I was like, oh man, that would have been pretty good, but I don't know.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
And actdeftinchat says, 3DS still sells a lot, a whole lot.

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
So, I mean, you know, there's still, I guess maybe with kids,

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
you see a lot more 3DS, maybe because the plastic's more durable.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
I don't know, but I just, I don't know.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
You know, again, I realize there's more people to game out there than just me,

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
but I just, I'm ready to let 3DS go, come on.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
They're like competing with themselves there.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I mean, you've got a portable system, you're like,

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
well no, don't buy the Switch, buy this cheaper portable system.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
No, you want to sell the Switch. What's going on?

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
DungeonBuster says this needs more Octopath Traveler.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Yeah, that looked all right.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
You know, I played the demo of Octopath Traveler.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
I love the art style they're going for with it.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
So it's nice that we have a date for that because they dated that in June, right?

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
Or it's coming up relatively soon. It's during the summer at some point.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
And so, and the name is Octopath Traveler.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
At one point they kind of said, this is the working title.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
I think that the project Octopath Traveler, but they have confirmed that's it.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Man, we need to come up with a new name.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Fuck it. I don't know.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Just leave it as it is.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Yeah, why would you change the name this far along?

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
Now everybody knows that it's this, so, I mean, it's a fine name, so.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Just, you know.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
It's the year of the Octolings.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
I just leave it to Octopath Traveler.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Year of the Octomom.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
We'll throw in a split.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
I don't want to travel that path.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
Go ahead and chat at live.vognetwork.com.

34:59.000 --> 35:05.000
RageNator in chat says, I suppose that there's a segment of the gaming community that has the 3DS but no Switch,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
so further 3DS support is great for them.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Maybe they're not in a position to get a Switch.

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
Yeah, but how much longer before the Switch starts coming down in price and getting a little more competitive

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
and we start seeing more used Switches out in the market?

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
Because that, I mean, if Nintendo does start this whole Switch in new colors will be the first thing,

35:22.000 --> 35:28.000
and then like an XL Switch or an amped up Switch or a new Switch or whatever it is, right?

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Because they've done this with the DS things.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
It's inevitable it's going to happen with Switch at some point.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Then the old stuff's going to show up on the used market,

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
and then I think you're going to see a lot more people that are adopting the Switch at that point.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
Maybe Nintendo is anticipating that in 2019.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
You know, I doubt they would put out a new Switch this year, but I bet they do something next year.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
They might do a Switch in a new color this year.

35:48.000 --> 35:55.000
That'll be the thing at E3, like a new, a neon green for Splatoon or something, they'll do a Switch.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
And then next year, oh no no, you know what it'll be?

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
You know what it'll be?

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
A Smash Brothers Switch console.

36:03.000 --> 36:11.000
It'll be the Switch controllers set up like the GameCube controller.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Remember that old rumor?

36:12.000 --> 36:19.000
Remember there was that old rumor about the fact that those detachable controllers could be different types of controllers?

36:19.000 --> 36:26.000
You know, we've never seen, I mean, Nintendo's never really discounted that that could ever happen.

36:26.000 --> 36:31.000
That would be a very interesting turn of events for Smash specifically,

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
is that all of a sudden you have GameCube style controllers that you can pop in there.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
That'd be very interesting, wouldn't it?

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
And something Nintendo could sell way over cost.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
And make a lot of money off of.

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
Alright, let's go ahead and if that's all we have to say about the Nintendo Direct,

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
which obviously I was pretty pleased with the Nintendo Direct.

36:56.000 --> 37:04.000
Even without the Smash reveal at the end, I was like, okay, this is about what I would expect for a non-E3 Direct,

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
but now E3, guys, here's the thing though.

37:08.000 --> 37:14.000
Everybody says, oh, Smash Brothers must be the tent pole, this must be the big thing for the year.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
Well, what does that leave Nintendo with for E3?

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
Prime 4?

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
But they've already said they're doing Prime 4, so you think there'll be no surprises at E3?

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
They could show off what their online thing's gonna be, I guess.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
I guess that could be it.

37:33.000 --> 37:39.000
Nintendo could really like, and maybe it's gonna be one of those, y'all, online was worth the wait.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
I know. Shut up.

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
Yeah, I'm sure it's just gonna be like, I was wrong! I was so wrong!

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Humor me, bastard.

37:50.000 --> 37:56.000
Humor me for a minute here that maybe, you know, online, and the first game they're gonna do online, F-Zero.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
We'll see. Anyway.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
Yes, that's what, okay, yeah, sure.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
Everybody in chat, when I say everybody, Bobby Black Wolf, F-Zero surprise.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Act F'd, F-Zero surprise.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Dungeon Buster, F-Zero for everyone.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
Just remove, just, yeah, yeah, here's what, F-Zero surprise, let me fix that for you.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
F, comma, zero surprise.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
Alright, look, I wanna mention too, actually, quickly, before we go off the topic of Nintendo Direct,

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
because Akuma JP mentioned that he hasn't watched the Direct, but Akuma JP is in Japan,

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
and Japan gets a different Direct. I mean, some of it overlaps, so they get different stuff.

38:34.000 --> 38:40.000
So it is worth mentioning that in Japan, Taiko Drummaster was confirmed as coming to the Switch.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Why doesn't that come out over here?

38:42.000 --> 38:48.000
Well, the Switch is region-free, so it could. It just won't be in English.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
But do you need English in a game like Taiko Drummaster? Probably not.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Eh, the menus.

38:53.000 --> 38:58.000
Also, Saga Scarlet Grace coming out on the Switch over there.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
But it is also happening on other systems as well.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
It's not gonna be unique to the Switch, but it's still a pretty big deal that that's happening,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
the Saga game gonna be happening on the Switch.

39:07.000 --> 39:12.000
And then lastly, Phantasy Star Online 2 coming to the Switch in Japan,

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
which I thought we already knew it was coming.

39:16.000 --> 39:21.000
I think we got a release date for it in the Direct, and that's April 4th, 2018.

39:21.000 --> 39:27.000
It's Phantasy Star Online 2 Cloud, and it does come with stuff from Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild in it.

39:27.000 --> 39:34.000
But unfortunately, Sega is continuing to give the U.S. the finger when it comes to Phantasy Star Online,

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
and we're not gonna be seeing it, which kinda sucks.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
Like, what Phantasy Star Online? I mean...

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
You don't get Phantasy Star Online, you get Sonic Shitty Friends instead.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
If the Switch is region-free, can I just download Phantasy Star Online,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
or the server's not gonna let me in because it's gonna go,

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
oh, you're a dumb American, you can't get into Japanese servers.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
That's what VPNs are for.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I guess. I dunno.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
Alright. Let's see.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
Act F says, as far as Taiko goes, the PlayStation 4 one has an English option,

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
so maybe they'll do the same for the Switch one.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
So, hm, there you go.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
Just release it over here! Why, if you're putting in English in the game,

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
just release the damn thing over here! Why is it such a problem?

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
I dunno. At least digitally. Well, wait, hold on.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
I'm assuming there's a peripheral that goes with it,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
so they can't do a digital release.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
No, you can play the controller.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
Well, okay, but you can play Beatmania with a controller,

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
but it's not as fun as it is with an actual Beatmania controller.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
Fine, but like the Switch version, I'm sure it's just motion control.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
Ah, several folks in chat, including Orangewrite,

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
lighting up with licensing J-pop might be a hassle,

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
so it might be the music license issues,

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
and they don't want to pay to have that out over here.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
So, Loki looks very irritated.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
I'm rolling my eyes! My eyes are rolling so much!

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Whatever.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
Your logic and facts have shut him down completely.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
No, it's just, it's dumb. Fine, whatever.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
We'll pull the Konami Dance Dance Revolution thing.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
No, you can't bring that over here. Bring it over here.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
No, you can't do it. Bring it over here.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Well, you could. The Switch is region-free, so you could.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
You're breaking the law!

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
I'm gonna shake my finger at you and look away.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Let's get into our gaming week,

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
and we'll start with the guy with a machine

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
that's not supposed to be sold outside Japan in his garage.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Because it wasn't sold outside of Japan.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Well, actually, you know what? Yeah, it was.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
So, I've been playing Dance Dance Revolution.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
So, I actually did, I was posting online

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
that I was cleaning my pads and everything,

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
so I finished cleaning the left side,

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
which was the one that was not really working too well,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
and so now it actually works really well.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
I was able to almost full combo songs.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
It's not the pads' fault that I can't full combo the song.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
It's because I'm out of shape.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Well, I'm not as out of shape as I was

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
when I first started playing,

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
but it's definitely a step up from where it was.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
And then the other thing that was wrong with my machine was

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
it's got an LCD monitor in there,

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
so the picture wasn't quite centered on the screen.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
It was cut off on the bottom,

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
and I did fix that as well.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Now, I probably still need to go back

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
and remod the pads one more time,

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
just because the way I did it this time,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
I put all the foam on top of the sensors,

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
or the brackets on top of the sensors,

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
and I didn't put any in the corners.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
It feels a little weird on there

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
because it kind of rocks sometimes

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
if you hit the arrow just the right way.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
So, I need to kind of put that in the corner

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
so it's more stable,

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
doesn't feel like it's gonna tilt a little bit.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
It doesn't really affect anything,

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
it's just kind of like, it just feels funny.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Then the other thing I noticed too was that

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
apparently I didn't level my stage too well,

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
so I was like,

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
why does it feel like I'm tipping towards the wall?

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
And it's because the feet on that side were too low,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
so I raised that back on the way.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Oh, okay, that's much better.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
So, it's just been tweaking stuff like that.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I'm not even gonna attempt to clean the right side right now

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
because that took like three days to do the last time.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Although, that side works really well,

43:05.000 --> 43:10.000
so I'm not gonna fix the problem until there is a problem.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
But yeah, I'm really enjoying it,

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
so I've been keeping up with it,

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
and I've been sticking with non-stops now,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
so I've been doing tons of non-stops,

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
and then I'll usually play something

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
that I know is way too hard for me

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
till I get my heart rate up,

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
so I'll try to do a kata or something,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
which I'm not back to that point again

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
where I can do those.

43:31.000 --> 43:36.000
Although, I do get through A on Heavy or Oni sometimes,

43:36.000 --> 43:42.000
and I full combo'd the Pop 4 non-stop the other day.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
I'm getting better.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
It's coming back.

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
It's just been so long.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
So, I've been playing that,

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
and then it's been mainly mobile games

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
because I've been actually programming during the week.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Sadly, not for my game.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I will get back to that, I swear.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
It's just I've been doing work stuff

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
because I've been trying to get a better job,

44:02.000 --> 44:08.000
and so I'm going way outside of my job roles

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
in trying to build an extension for Google Chrome,

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
and so I've been doing that.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Promotions are good, though.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
That's more money to buy more games.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Right, more money.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
Yeah, exactly.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
So, I'm going to get back to that,

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
but I haven't played mobile stuff,

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
so I've been doing Pokemon Go a little bit

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
because I've been in different places

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
with Pokésops nearby,

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
so I've been playing that quite a bit.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
I have a little bit of Ingress

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
when I'm waiting for Pokésops to recharge again,

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
and a little bit of that Office Space game,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
but it's really irritating.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
That's more of like I'm not near Pokéstop.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I've already caught a little Pokemon around me.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
Crap, got to play the Office Space game now.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
So, that's pretty much it.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
All right.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
Let's see, my gaming week.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
It's really been a lot of the same stuff

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
because I'm still hammering away on Final Fantasy XIV,

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
my big MMO addiction.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
My Red Mage finally hit 70.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
That's a class I've really been enjoying playing,

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
so I finally hit 70 on that this week,

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
so that's pretty cool,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
and it feels nice because you can start buying

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
all the really big gear,

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
and it's like this big jump from level 69 to 70,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
so that's cool.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I've been still playing Heroes of the Storm.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
In fact, I was playing a little bit of that

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
after OLR last week,

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
and that was a lot of fun,

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
doing some Heroes of the Storm,

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
and I've just been continuing on that game,

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
just trying to level my character slowly.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
I made sure to get all the stuff from the Lunar Fest,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
and now I got 10,000 gold.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
I don't think I bought another character yet with it,

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
so I have to figure out which character I want to get next,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
so there is that.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
I need to get back to Overwatch

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
because Alan and I were talking a little bit

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
about Overwatch today,

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
and he reminded me they did some changes to Sombra,

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
and that was one of my favorite characters in the game,

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
but people don't really like it when you play Sombra

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
because I guess people don't see that she's effective,

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
but I really like playing her,

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
so if they've done some changes,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I really want to get in there and see what that's all about,

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
and I need to try Brigitte on the test realm as well,

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
the new character.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
Oh, yeah.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Yeah, she looks pretty cool.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
Isn't she just like Torbjorn?

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
She's like Torbjorn and Reinhardt had a kid.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
Yeah, except they didn't, but they did.

46:12.000 --> 46:17.000
So anyway, yeah, I'm curious to check that out for sure,

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
and then I also played a lot of Pokemon Go yesterday, a lot,

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
because we have the double XP thing going on right now.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
How long is that going on for?

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
Until the 15th, I think, so it's only a few more days,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
but it's been a long event, I mean, all things considered,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
but you know, it was one of those things

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
that was just a perfect storm of events

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
where I didn't really have a lot going on yesterday.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
I didn't have a lot to do, so Shane and I were talking,

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
and we had talked about going down to the capital

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
maybe to play a lot of Pokemon Go,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
but then long story short, we were like,

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
why don't we just go to San Francisco?

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Why don't we just go to Pier 39

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
and get all this stuff that shows up there

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
and just walk and get the stops in the gyms

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
that are in San Francisco?

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Let's do that.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
So we did, we went to San Francisco yesterday

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
and walked around for a significant amount of time,

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
and what's really funny is that I ran into Dark Soccer

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
yesterday before she started feeling ill.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
I ran into her yesterday at Japantown,

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
like totally out of the blue.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
We didn't plan to meet up.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
I knew she was gonna be there in the city

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
because there's a big drag queen show going on at the Castro,

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
and you know she goes to those

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
because my buddy JD was there too,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
and I couldn't meet up with him either

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
because the drag queen's getting in the way,

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
but I didn't have tickets to that show,

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
and it just wasn't on my radar of stuff to do,

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
but it was really funny that we met up anyway

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
with Jamie like unplanned at Japantown,

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
and Shane and I were walking to the arcade there,

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
and Dark Soccer and her friend Becky were walking

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
from one of the stores there, and Jamie with her hair,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
her hair is like bright pink now.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
You can't miss her, so I was like,

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
of course, of course I run into you guys here.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Of course I do, so it was pretty funny,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
and I caught a lot of Pokemon

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
and got a lot of stops and gyms in San Francisco,

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
and walked a lot of eggs.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
I've hatched so many fucking Swablues.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
I already-

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
I need more of those.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
400? What the hell do I need-

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
I've already evolved one, and I'm halfway to another.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
They're just, they're herpes.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
They're everywhere.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
They're in every 2K egg right now.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
I don't think I've hatched a 2K egg yet

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
that didn't have a Swablu in it during this event.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Crazy.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
So, all right, let's see.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Actf says, I need more Swablu too.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
This event with the bonus to air Pokemon,

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
or whatever it is, is huge on Swablu.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
There's so many Swablu in 2Ks,

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
and that's good too,

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
because you're more likely to get a Wonder Swablu,

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
so that when you evolve it, you'll have a Wonder.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
But here's the other thing.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
They're not very good.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
They're not worth the four.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
It's not like a Gyarados.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
You're gonna spend the 400 candies to evolve it,

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
and then be like, oh.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
It's like Wailmer.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Like, Wailord looks cool,

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
like it's hilarious when you put Wailord in a gym,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
but Wailord isn't really that great

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
of an attacker or defender,

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
and it's kind of the same thing with Swablu's evolution.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
So, yeah, that's the bummer about it.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
But, of course, I know how it is, y'all.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
You gotta catch them all.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
It's in the subtitle of the game.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
You gotta catch them all,

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
and you gotta fill out that Pokedex.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
Thankfully for Allen, we just went on a raid today,

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
and we actually did two raids today.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
He finally got his Rayquaza today

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
so he can relax with his Pokedex being full.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
That was actually a really funny story

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
because we were out doing Ingress stuff today.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
One of the gals that you heard here a couple months ago,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
she put together one of those really fun

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Let's Cover the City events, right?

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
So I went out and did that today,

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
and I was doing my part in that,

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
and then it was about 30 minutes out,

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
and I drove home.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
And as I'm pulling up the park,

49:41.000 --> 49:46.000
I see a gal parked next to what I know as the Pokemon gym,

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
and I look in the car and I'm like,

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
I know her.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
She's at every raid that happens around here.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
So I actually rolled out my window.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
She recognized me. I rolled out my window.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
I'm like, is there a Pokemon raid going?

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
She's like, yeah, they're all coming over right now.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
We just did one over at Bleep Bleep Bleep,

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
the other gym that's not far from here,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
and we're gonna do the one here.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
And I'm like, cool.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
So I just parked and walked over to the gym,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
and I got to do that Pokemon raid.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
I guess they were doing like,

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
this is a thing now during the double XP

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
because if you pop an egg, you get quadruple XP.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
So you get 40K from a raid right now.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
So they did one over yonder.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
I don't want to say it on air

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
because I don't want to give away where I live,

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
but over like yonder, they did one.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
They came to the park and they did one.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Then they went to the other park.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
So do you have to get like invited to those?

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
Because I saw one the other day,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
like I was going to spin,

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
like one of the things is all,

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
sorry, this gym is closed for a raid or something.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
Like, well, how do I join that?

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
You might've just walked up on it during a Mewtwo raid.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Those you have to be invited to.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
And I'm a little salty.

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
I have never been invited to a fucking EX raid in Pokemon GO.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
And I try to do the raids pretty regularly.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
I don't go out of my way

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
to go all the way to the fucking mall

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
to go to Starbucks, or not Starbucks.

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
The mall over here that has the Sprint store.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
That's what it is.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
The Sprint store is a gym.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
And that's the one that everybody goes to raid to get,

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
but I'm not going to go all the way over there

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
just to get a chance

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
that maybe I'll get to go back on Saturday.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
You know what's going to happen to me though, Loki.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
I'm going to tell you right now what's going to happen.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
I'm going to get an EX pass for next Saturday,

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
but what's the punchline?

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
You're going to be out of town.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
No, I'm going to get a pass.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Close, that would be the other one,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
is that I'll get a pass for next next Saturday

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
when I'm going to be out of town.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
But I'm going to get a pass for this Saturday in San Francisco.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
Watch.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
Because I did some raids there.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
I bet you anything.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
I get a pass that's going to make me go back to Pier 39.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
But the good news is,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
at least I know there'll be a group to do it

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
because there is nothing but spoofers in that.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
In Fisherman's Wharf,

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
it is nothing but fucking spoofers.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
Well, I shouldn't say that.

51:44.000 --> 51:49.000
We did the Rayquaza raid at this place called The Room Blue Jeans,

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
is what it's called,

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
because they still have a poster for The Room.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
You know that movie, The Citizen Kane of bad movies?

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
I did a hosting of it here in Sac and all that long ago.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
They still have a poster of The Room up in San Francisco

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
because the movie's set there.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
So that happens to be a Pokémon gym, right?

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
So we get there and we get there right as it starts.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
And so we go in the gym right as it starts

52:09.000 --> 52:13.000
and we just know we don't even need to wait for other people.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Watch what's going to happen.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
And sure enough, fills up to 20 people like that.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
And we look around.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
We see two other guys on their phone playing Pokémon GO.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
One other guy that might be playing Pokémon GO

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
but he also might be getting a lift.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
And that's it.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
So at most, of the 20 people that were in that raid,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
five of them were legitimate.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
So that's the state of Pokémon GO right now.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
But at least that Rayquaza melted.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
So that was kind of cool, I guess.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Alright, anyway.

52:44.000 --> 52:49.000
ActDeftInChat says, I have three Rayquazas.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
I still only have one.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
I have the worst time throwing the fucking ball at those Rayquazas.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Like, I'm lucky if I connect twice.

52:55.000 --> 53:00.000
And I just, by some miracle of God, the first Rayquaza raid I did,

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
the second ball I threw, I managed to catch it.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
And I was like, thank God.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
And it was even a wonder.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
It was a wonder Rayquaza, so good enough.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Like, sure, I'd love to get a 100% Rayquaza.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
But you know what? Good enough.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I'm going to settle for a C.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
So how do you know if they're a wonder or not?

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
You do the appraisal.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
You're mystic, right?

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
Yeah.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
You do the appraisal and she'll say, this Pokémon is a wonder.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Valor and Instinct, they say different things.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
But they're just, it's whatever the best sounding expression is that they say.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
Got it.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Is the highest IV.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
It's between, I think, is it 80% above or 85% above?

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
It might be 80. I think it's 80% and above.

53:36.000 --> 53:43.000
But honestly, like, I don't think the IVs matter that much for what the game is.

53:43.000 --> 53:49.000
But I feel like for PvP, a lot of people are concerned that maybe it is going to matter a lot more in PvP.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
So we'll see.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
All right.

53:53.000 --> 54:00.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at thevognetwork.com, use the passphrase, curve.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Anyway, let's move on.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
I talked more than enough about Pokémon GO.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
Let's move on into some actual gaming news.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
I would say some announcements, though, real quick.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
We will not be here in two weeks.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
I'm going to be out of town in two weeks, so there's no show March 25th.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
Unfortunately, we're also not going to be here April 1st.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
And that is not an April Fool's Day joke.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
April Fool's Day is also Easter this year.

54:22.000 --> 54:27.000
And Loki has family obligations and Dark Sakura has obligations with her charity group that she works with.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
So we won't be here live either of those two nights.

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
However, we don't want to miss two shows in a row, so we are making plans to try to tape something at some point.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
So we'll at least have a new show on April 1st.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
It just won't be live.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
So sorry to our live folks.

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
We should tape a Ready Player One special show.

54:45.000 --> 54:52.000
Maybe. We can go on a group date, see the movie, and then do a chat about it, whatever else happened in the news.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
I'm down with that, sure.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Yes, we should.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
It'll be great, too, if Jamie and I fucking hate the movie.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
It's a Spielberg movie.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
What's the hate?

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
I don't like all his movies. Some of them are not that great.

55:04.000 --> 55:10.000
But the ones I don't like are the ones that everybody, kind of like the big award winners and stuff, and I'm like, okay.

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
I think Spielberg's overrated, but at the same time, like, I love Hook.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
But that's the one everybody hates.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Well, all the critics hate it.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
Yeah, if the critics hate it, I'll love it.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
If the critics love it, I'll hate it.

55:23.000 --> 55:28.000
I think people already hate it because, I don't know, people are haters.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
I'm really excited about it. I want to see it.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
I know you do.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
And I've already spoiled it for myself by reading leaked scripts, so I already know what kind of happens.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
It's based on a book, right?

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
It doesn't follow the book.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
Oh.

55:40.000 --> 55:48.000
It doesn't follow the book exactly. It sort of follows the book, but the challenges that are in it are different from the book.

55:48.000 --> 55:53.000
Bobby Black Wolf in Chat says, I'm tired of the hype. Where are you seeing it?

55:54.000 --> 55:59.000
Maybe it's just because I don't watch enough TV or whatever, but I feel like I'm not really seeing a lot of it.

55:59.000 --> 56:05.000
There's some trailers, but like, I don't know. It looks good. I want to see it.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
I'm sure we'll see.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
I'm seeing it opening day.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Why wouldn't I see it? I don't know. Alright.

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
Let's get into some gaming news. Let's not oversaturate it anymore for Bobby. Let's go right into the news.

56:16.000 --> 56:31.000
Let's talk about Fortnite. So Fortnite is coming to mobile platforms, and they're also going to allow you to actually play with, you know, it's going to basically be very similar to the game that's on consoles and PC right now.

56:31.000 --> 56:38.000
With the whole, they're going to support like cross-play, so you're going to be able to cross-progression.

56:38.000 --> 56:45.000
So you'll be able to, between the PlayStation 4, PC, Mac, iOS, and Android, you'll be able to sync that.

56:45.000 --> 56:53.000
This is kind of strange, where it's, you know, syncing with Sony and not Microsoft.

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
Usually Sony's the one that's like, no, no, no, we can't do that.

56:57.000 --> 57:11.000
But you'll be able to sync your progress across those, and of course, you know, I guess they're going to start rolling it out on Monday, and you can sign up, and I guess Android will be coming in the next few months.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
It's going to be interesting to see how that plays out.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
Mobile, though?

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
Yeah.

57:17.000 --> 57:22.000
That's the thing, mobile? Those are going to be the easiest targets.

57:22.000 --> 57:28.000
I just can't even, keyboard and mouse versus mobile. Am I understanding this right?

57:28.000 --> 57:34.000
Well, you could do, you know, controller or something like that, you know, you could sync something to it.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
But yeah, I don't know if I'd want to play Fortnite.

57:37.000 --> 57:46.000
Also, you know, Fortnite, I hope no one's playing on a mobile network, because that's going to be even worse. I don't know.

57:46.000 --> 57:57.000
I mean, I get that Androids and iPhones are really powerful little computers in your pocket, and we sometimes forget just how meaty those chips are that are in them and stuff.

57:57.000 --> 58:07.000
I mean, they are pretty impressive pieces of technology, but mobile? Like, touch controls? It's going to be, you're right, you have to hook up like a Bluetooth.

58:07.000 --> 58:14.000
But, you know, your choices are so limited over on, like, there's no official Apple controller type of thing.

58:14.000 --> 58:18.000
You know, I'm sure, I know there's a ton of stuff on Google, but, you know.

58:18.000 --> 58:23.000
Not even really with Android either. I mean, it's more of like, there's some support for certain things.

58:23.000 --> 58:28.000
You can, I think on the Android, you can sync also like a PlayStation 4 controller and stuff.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
But I don't know if you have to have that rooted to fully support that.

58:32.000 --> 58:39.000
I know the one I have is pretty nice. It's like an Xbox 360 controller, but it's, you know, and that supports you.

58:39.000 --> 58:44.000
But, I don't know. Yeah, mobile. I know.

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
If I had a choice, I'll just wait and I'll play it at home. Yeah.

58:48.000 --> 58:52.000
Now, the console and PC, that's exciting. You know, that's very cool.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
A lot of people wish Overwatch would do that, but I understand.

58:55.000 --> 59:02.000
But, I mean, you would think that if it supported mobile, then maybe you could get it to run on the Switch?

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Nothing official yet.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
You know, I mean, I would think that would be a better option than mobile.

59:08.000 --> 59:13.000
SSJ100Matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Fortnite wants to go the Microsoft route.

59:13.000 --> 59:17.000
Get it on every possible platform while it's still hot. Oh, I'm sure.

59:17.000 --> 59:22.000
You know, a lot of this has to do, and the fact that Sony kind of, you know, caved on some of their cross-platform stuff,

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
it just has to do with how big Fortnite is right now.

59:25.000 --> 59:33.000
And, I would imagine Microsoft has left out a little bit because they've investigated all their stuff in PUBG, right?

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
Might have something to do with it.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
Maybe. So, is like the Fortnite vanilla game still a thing?

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
Because I remember that was going to be like a zombie survival game, and...

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
I believe it's still there.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Did you just say, fuck that, let's do the Battle Royale thing?

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
No, I'm pretty sure Fortnite single-player is still a thing.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
It's just, that's not what people were really talking about.

59:53.000 --> 01:00:00.000
It's just like, you know, in Overwatch you can play against AI, but nobody ever talks about that.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
And I do!

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Alright. Anyway, so, how many of y'all checked out the Chrono Trigger release on PC recently?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
No thanks, I read the reviews.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Yeah, speaking of mobile stuff going to PC, yeah...

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000
In fact, the game is mostly negative on Steam right now.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
39% is where it was sitting at earlier this week.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
So Square Enix actually went to the Steam news page to say,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Hi everyone, thank you for the feedback you've shared so far regarding Chrono Trigger.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
We wanted to let you know that we are reading and listening to your messages,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
and are aware of all the issues you've raised, which we're currently assessing.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Please keep an eye on the Steam page for further information.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Thanks for your patience and support, the Chrono Trigger team.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Now here's the thing, what are they going to be able to fix?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
They ported the mobile game.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I mean, are they going to have to go back and just basically change the mobile game to fix some of these issues?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Which include, by the way, crappy controller stuff because it's adapted from a touchscreen thing,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
so the controller doesn't do what you think it would do.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Some of the horrible RuPaul's Drag Race Season 1 filter that's applied to the sprite artwork,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
if you don't know what I'm talking about, imagine you smeared Vaseline all over the lens.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
That's what the game looks like.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
So, yeah, it's just, it's not great.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And so, what are they going to do though?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
It's a company cutting corners because they thought, oh, Chrono Trigger, people are going to want it.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
And they cut corners.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000
By saying cut corners, it was, we released the mobile ports of Final Fantasy IV, V, and VI,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
and they did pretty well, so put Chrono Trigger in the queue, let's do that one too.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
That's what they did.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Well.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
But, here's the interesting thing.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Modders have now entered the picture.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Uh-oh, now, here's why they waited a while to put it on PC because now, you know, what do we say?

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Hackers going to hack, and right along with that, modders going to mod, right?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000
So, apparently, some of the things that they have been doing with the game is,

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:12.000
the modders have jumped in, and let's see, there's a tool called Final Fantasy VI Explorer,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
and that was used on the Final Fantasy VI port that was kind of eh.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
And Final Fantasy VI Explorer let other modders dig in the files, understand what's going on,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
and replace sprites and other assets to make things look better.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And sure enough, went in there, there's an update now to CT Explorer with modding capability,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and that was all announced on this guy's Twitter.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
That's my trunks, is the tweet, and already people are going in there with the CT tool

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
and fixing up some of the sprites and things like that.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
So, uh, yeah, modders are getting in there and already working,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
and you can see some of their results all around the internet.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
There's also Steam forum threads on that, and so on and so on.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
So, kind of unsurprised that that's happening.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Sj100matt in chat says, Hackers going to fix the game.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000
AkumaJP says, Chrono Trigger Porn. Anything is possible.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I'm sure you can-

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Where are we on the porn for Final Fantasy XV, or like, you know, the-

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I'm sure they've got nude mods and shit already.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Oh, oh, oh, for the PC release?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Yes.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I don't know, I haven't heard about nude mods for Final Fantasy XV.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I mean, it's only been a couple days, but-

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Long enough.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
It's been a couple days, I mean, come on.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I expect that stuff immediately.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
But I would just assume that, you know, that they do have that already.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Um, let's see, I, uh, I'm looking, and I'm getting a lot of hits,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
so I, of course, I googled nude mods for Final Fantasy XV,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
and we're getting a lot of hits on the article that talked about-

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Please no nude mods, yeah.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
That that would be up to the player base, like, the creators of the game were like,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000
that's what you want to do, it's out of our control, right, basically?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Uh, and then one of the big hits here from the Steam community,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
nude Cindy mod, please.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Of course, of course.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Right?

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Of course.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Uh, but then there's a link here, uh, I think that, no,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I think that's just that same news story.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
So maybe the smart-

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Maybe not yet.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Yeah, the smart thing about commenting on the news story

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
is that all the game blogs ran that news story,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
so when you search for Final Fantasy XV nude mod, you get that news story.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
So it makes it harder to find the actual nude mod.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
But I'm sure that will be a thing that happens at some point.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Alright.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Uh, Slidekick in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
hi Slidekick, says, uh,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
surprising that Loki is asking about Final Fantasy XV nude mods, but bless,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
except he probably only cares about nude Cindy, not nude Gladiel.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Look, here's the thing, knowing Loki as long as I have,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Loki just knows it's gonna happen.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Like, Loki doesn't-

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Yeah, this is a matter, it's not necessarily-

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Loki doesn't have, like, a vested interest in this.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
No, it's not that, it's like, it's like a, um, what do we call it?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
This is something he's gonna show the wife, they're gonna laugh at,

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
and then move on.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Oh, the wife doesn't care?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Like, I thought it was gonna, like,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
hey, I'm gonna show you some mod on the game site,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I'm already tuning you out, you said games.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
You guys used to do this years ago, I-

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Show you.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Back when we lived together, you would show her hilarious stuff

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
and she'd laugh at it, so.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
She doesn't care.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Video games are so stupid, you guys are stupid,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
and you do that stupid show.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
God, you're still doing that show?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Why are you still doing that show?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Is that show still not making you money?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
It's a hobby, if you're not making money,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
it's a hobby, it's not a job.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
It's a hobby.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
And we wouldn't have met any of these fine people out here on the internet

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
if it wasn't for this hobby.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I don't see anything on ModDB, so I'm assuming-

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Alright, no nude mod yet.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Slag kick?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
It's just, it's up to you to make it.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Get to work.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Because eventually it's gonna be like,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Okay, this mod turns a cactuar into, like, a multi-faceted dick monster that,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
you know, and oh, it's just-

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
That's not the same thing.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
And then we gotta get Macho Man Randy Savage in there somewhere, you know.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
That's the kind of-

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I wanna play-

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
That's the shit that's gonna make me-

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I wanna play my Final Fantasy XV like I play my Skyrim.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Macho Man Randy Savage, boobs everywhere,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
and like the fucking dubstep gun.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And like the fucking dubstep gun.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
That is how I wanna play my game.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
That's gonna be the shit that finally convinces me to get Final Fantasy XV on PC.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Even though I've been resisting, like,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
No, Rob, the game was mediocre, do not buy it again.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
When you talk about, like, Macho Man Randy Savage,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I- I-

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Boobs are funny, whatever.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Like, sure, put boobs in it.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
They've turned their car into Thomas the Tank Engine.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Yeah, sure, and Macho Man Randy Savage.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Oh yeah, like, why not?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Do all of it and I'm there.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I'm sold.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Sure.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Sure. Alright.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
And, you know what else would be really funny, okay?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So you know how Ignis cooks after every meal.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000
What Ignis should be cooking is the remains of the creatures that they've killed.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
So I wanna see an Ignis cooking mod where he's making, like,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And tonight we dine on roasted Chocobo, you know, so.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
We've cooked the Macho Man Randy Savage and we've gotten Slim Jims.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Bobby Blackwool says,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Ignis is cooking the last fucks that he had to give.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Correct. Correct.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
He's cooking some mess.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Ignis is cooking Chapter 13.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Oh, I like that idea too.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Final Fantasy XV My Little Drug Lab.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Alright.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Please, a new story. Loki.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Alright, let's talk about Call of Duty.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
So Call of Duty is not going back to World War II again,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
it's going back to the future, I think.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000
So it's Black Ops 4 is gonna be the official game coming out this year.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Somewhere I miss Black Ops 3.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I know it exists, but I never played it.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
And I'm trying to think back in my head why I didn't play it,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
because I like Black Ops 2.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And I know Infinity Warfare looked kind of ridiculous and stupid,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
but I just don't remember playing Black Ops 3.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
But I may have to check this out.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Anyway, so they're gonna have a reveal event for the community on May 17th.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
The global launch of the game is kind of surprising.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Usually that's gonna be a game that they release in November.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
This year, though, releasing in October.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
On October 12th for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
It doesn't seem that early.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
It's still the right season.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Considering all the launches for past Call of Duty games,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
it's definitely a deviation.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Alright, alright. Fair enough.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
So they didn't really say what it's about,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
but I just hope it's not stupid.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Please don't be stupid.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
If they're not making the Call of Duty...

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Because they're not putting this on Switch, right?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
They haven't talked about this yet?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
No, they're not putting it on Switch.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
They're not putting it on Switch.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Well, I guess something that is coming to Switch is

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Game Maker Studio 2 is gonna be coming out for the Nintendo Switch.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And this is a program that they use to make a lot of different 2D games.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
In fact, I think Undertale was made in this game?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I could be wrong.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Spelunky was Game Maker as well.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Was it?

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Yeah, that was a pretty good game.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
There's been a lot of really good games that have come out for Game Maker.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I don't know.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
So for example, they've got it coming to the Switch.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
They do.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Oh, here we go. Other games.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Hotline Miami was built on that tool as well.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Did you know that?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Anyway, but the cool thing is that it is coming out Game Maker 2

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
and you're gonna be able to, I guess, export your stuff to the Switch.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
And it's gonna be launching this summer.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
YoYo Games' James Cox said,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Nintendo has been hugely supportive of bringing independent releases to the Nintendo Switch console.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And this partnership will mean even more wonderful games are released on the platforms.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
That's gonna be pretty cool.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Anything that makes it easier for people to put their games on consoles?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I mean, back when I was little and like,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
oh man, it'd be so amazing to be able to publish a game on a console and be able to play that game.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Now it's actually much easier to do that than it used to be.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000
And to be clear, it's not that Game Maker, the program is on the Switch

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000
because you have to write code and things the Switch doesn't do.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
But they're coming out with a version of Game Maker that is for exporting to the Switch.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Well, it's basically a plugin that they have for Game Maker to export to different platforms.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
So right now they've got, you know, you can do mobile platforms.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
You can do, you know, the PC.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
You can do some consoles as well.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Now they're having the Switch as one of the options.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
It's kind of like how Unity has those where you build for a certain target platform.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Bobby Black Wolf of Chat says, Game Maker is great for 2D games.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
It's preferable to Unity in that sense.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
If I'm not mistaken, aren't your 2D games in Unity like basically faked 3D?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
If I remember right?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
It's changed a lot.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
So they have like a big focus on 2D stuff now too.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I mean, it's hard to keep up with everything.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Like recently they've even added more stuff to Unity to make it, it seems like, a little bit more like Unreal

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:13.000
where they have, they bought the rights to, god I can't remember the program I have, the plugin too.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
But it's basically to build 3D models within Unity.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:25.000
So you can build out a map in Unity in the editor without having to go build the model and import it and all that stuff.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
So they've got that.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000
But yeah, it is definitely pretty strong for 2D games.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
That's what it's been used for.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I don't know about Game Maker making 3D games, but we're checking out.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And especially if you catch it, every now and then they put Humble Bundles out there with Game Maker in there.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Yeah, they do, and I missed the last one.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I tend to grab it, even though I don't use it.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I'm like, well someday I might decide I want to use it, and I want the keys, so I've got the keys.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I think I have Game Maker 1 though, where the last one was, so I don't know.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Bobby is emphasizing in chat, Game Maker doesn't do 3D games.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
It specializes in 2D, and that's why people tend to float to that for 2D.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Although, heck, there's still people making games in Commodore 64 Basic.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
So people are going to program on whatever they want.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Do whatever works for you.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
That's right, do whatever works for you.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
People are still making Atari 2600 games all these years later.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Why not?

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Loki, what do you have?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
So, speaking of more games coming to the Switch and other platforms,

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Crash Bandicoot Trilogy, we mentioned it was coming to the Switch,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
but not only that, it's not just now going to be exclusive to two platforms,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
but it's also coming out on Xbox One and PC as well.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
So that exclusivity for PlayStation 4 is done,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.000
and they're going to be coming, I guess, to those platforms on July 10th.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I'm sorry, but Crash Bandicoot on the Xbox,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000
that's like as big to me as Sonic on a Nintendo platform.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000
I realized that Sony didn't make Crash Bandicoot,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
but it's just like, in my childhood, you really associated Crash Bandicoot with Sony.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
They've had Xbox Crash games, I thought.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Did they?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Yeah, I remember selling some on the Xbox 360.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I know they had the Crash Tag Team Racing was one.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Oh, yeah, that's true.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I thought that they had another one, too, that was like Xbox or Xbox 360.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
These weren't good games, that's why I forgot them.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Yeah, that was back when everyone wanted to make a kart racing game,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000
like Sonic was doing it, Sony was doing it.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Everyone's got to steal Nintendo's thunder.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Come on, Sony, give the fighter all-stars thing another shot.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Wasn't that terrible?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000
We got the Bioshock guy in there.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I would love to see that again, but more battle royale games,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
or more fighting games like that.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Well, maybe a PlayStation All-Stars battle royale game

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000
could be a launch title for the PlayStation 5.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
That's right, I'm going to talk about the PlayStation 5, y'all.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Oh, boy.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
All right, here we go, here's what's happening.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
I can already hear Bobby's eyes rolling to the back of his head

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000
and taking a big, deep sigh as we explore what's happening in PlayStation 5.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
But here's the real deal.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Obviously, PlayStation 5 is under development.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Are you saying that the PlayStation 4 Pro is not doing amazingly well?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
It's not even that, Loki.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
The PlayStation 5 was in development the day they released the PlayStation 4,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
if not sooner.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
That's how far out these things have to be planned.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
And we know that, you know, let's say they are planning

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
on releasing a PlayStation 5 in...

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
And I'm sorry if you guys just heard my Google chat go off.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Like, the one time I freaking leave that open,

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I, bleh, we get messages. Sorry, that was me.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Anyway, where was I? Dang it.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
And that derailed what I was talking about.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Oh, yeah, PlayStation 5.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
So these launch games for PlayStation 5, assuming they run 4K,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000
and assuming they are, like, really smooth, you know, running and all that,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
and that these are things we're going to expect out of PlayStation 5,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
these studios are going to need years to develop a game for this system.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
So it would not be surprising that even if they are not planning

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
to release PlayStation 5 until 2020,

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
that we start hearing this news, and that's what we have tonight,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000
that PlayStation 5 dev kits have been sent to some third-party studios.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
This rumor coming from Marcus Sellers over on Twitter,

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
but, and you might just think, well, why should I trust some rando guy on Twitter?

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Well, this same rando guy also said that Black Ops 4 would be this year's call of duty,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
and that turned out to be true.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
That's just a guess.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.000
And the correct date of the Nintendo Direct before it was announced.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.000
This guy has also said that Nintendo Switch Diablo 3 port is happening.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000
We didn't see that in the Direct, but, I mean, it hasn't really been denied either totally,

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
so we'll see. I would say if that wasn't announced still at E3, then it's not happening.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
But we'll see.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Anyway, so take it with a grain of salt.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
That was the tweet made saying basically PlayStation 5 dev kits

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
went out early this year to third-party developers.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
But honestly, like, why wouldn't I believe that?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
That doesn't mean they're announcing the PlayStation 5 at E3.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.000
It just means it's time to start thinking about 2020.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And I would think 20-

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
But I thought they were on a 10-year cycle. What happened to that?

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Yeah, but the PlayStation 3 is on a 10-year cycle as well,

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000
but that doesn't mean the PlayStation 4 wasn't already out for the last few years.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Right?

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Eh, whatever.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Okay, so the PlayStation 4 came out 2013, right?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
That's when the PlayStation 4 came out, 2013.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
PlayStation 3 was out 2000-

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
No, yeah, 2006.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
So that was seven years between PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
So 2020 would be seven years from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
But it's only been one year since PlayStation 4 Pro.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Actually, not even one year.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Well...

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Six months.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Well...

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I'm not really con- I mean, the PlayStation 4 Pro is-

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Well, I guess this goes back to we're just gonna iterate

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
and gonna release a new console every year or some bullshit or...

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
But, like, at this point, like, I get it.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I get it that, you know, you want a more powerful console, but...

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Guess what?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Microsoft is doing the same thing.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
It's not even Xbox One X.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I feel we're getting to the point of divisionist returns here.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
It's like...

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
How much better are we gonna...

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
What exactly improvements are we gonna see?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
I mean, smoother gameplay and 4K visuals natively are...

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Well, hopefully this time, but, like...

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
It's gonna get to a point where we can't, you know...

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
It's not gonna be worth it, I guess.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I would say things that are gonna help the developers make their games.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Like, consoles that help out developers and aren't as challenging to develop for.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
And what I mean by that is that, you know, you guys,

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
if we're gonna have, like, artists making 4K assets for all these games,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
games are gonna take even fucking longer to finish.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000
So, if we don't, you know, have a system that kind of helps developers

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
in getting done what they need to do, like...

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
You know what I mean?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Right.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
So, that's the thing we need most out of PlayStation 5.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I know that sounds really weird, but I think, I mean,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.000
you're gonna be looking at games that are on, like, five- and six-year development cycles

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
if we don't have some of those things figured out.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Not necessarily.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
That's only if you really wanna push it to that kind of quality, but...

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I guess.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Not every game has to be that quality to be a success.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
That's what my point is, like...

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I get it. You wanna push the hardware so they can do more, make prettier games and stuff,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
but does a prettier game necessarily make it a better game?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Not really. Not necessarily.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
So...

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I don't know. I think you need to focus more on, like...

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
We need to make games better. How can we make games better?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Could it be that they're more immersive? Could we find, like, a new method?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Like...

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
What's our next step towards the holodeck?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Is really what we should be saying.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
What's our next step towards the holodeck?

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
What can we add to the experience to make games more immersive?

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Because, like, if you argue it, look at, like, the PlayStation VR or even, like, any VR platform.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
It's not necessarily that the graphics are better, but it's a more immersive experience

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
which makes it seem better than some of the other games that are out there

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
because it's different. It puts you more inside it.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:25.000
And, yes, having more powerful hardware to push those visuals for VR or something like that would help as well,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.000
but I just think we're getting to a point now where, like, even, like, the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro,

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
it's like, if I was gonna play it on PlayStation VR, it's a slight visual improvement.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Or we have slightly better textures.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000
This one runs in 4K, but if I have a 4K TV, it's slightly crisper.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
At some point, it's just not gonna matter.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Maybe they're just gonna finally make a game console that'll fuck you.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Like, maybe...

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Japan's working on it.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Maybe... Maybe that's the true endgame.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I know we keep saying the endgame is the holodeck,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
but in some ways I feel like the true endgame in video games is a console that'll fuck you,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
and no one else will.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Like a co... Am I wrong?

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
You're not wrong.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
On that note, let's go back to a classic time.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
In video game history.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
With the classic game of the week.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Back in a simpler time with gaming consoles.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
They didn't fuck you. They didn't even buy you a drink.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Well, game consoles definitely nowadays, the console games do fuck you,

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
as far as, like, the content that they give you for the money that you pay,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
but not necessarily in a way that's pleasurable.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Anyway, Dark Sakura ain't here, and if she was, we'd probably have to behave ourselves,

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
and that's why this show's completely derailed tonight.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
But anyway, it's the classic game of the week.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Now, usually when Dark Sakura isn't here, I take over and pick a game,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
but I was thinking, you know, I shouldn't do it all the time.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Loki needs to get some picks in here, too.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000
So, it's Loki's turn to take over and pick the classic game of the week.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Loki, what did you pick out of the gaming vault for the classic game of the week?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Breaking all the rules. We're gonna do Halo 2, 3, and 4.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
No, actually, we're doing Saints Row.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
You really want to get fucked. That's one way to do it,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
because you'll be dead next to each other.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Oh, Saints Row! Saints Row.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Saints Row is the classic game of the week.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Yeah, Saints Row.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
So, Saints Row was a game that was going to basically revolutionize.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
It was gonna be the Grand Theft Auto killer.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Grand Theft Auto killer.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
So, it was a game that was developed for the PlayStation 2 originally

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
under the title Bling Bling.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Thank God they changed that name.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
So, it actually began work in mid-2003.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000
And then, of course, you know, with the new consoles coming out and stuff,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000
eventually it came out for the Xbox 360 back in 2006.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And just so you know, I do have game audio running in the background,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
but there's not really a lot of music,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
and I'm just waiting for abrupt machine gun fire to interrupt this,

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
so just bear with us here with the audio.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Oh, yes, it's inevitable.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
So, Saints Row, you played the role of the player,

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.000
or basically this brand new inductee to the 3rd Street Saints,

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000
who are a fictional gang in a fictional city of Stillwater.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And basically, it's about you becoming integrated in this gang

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
and trying to take over the rest of Stillwater,

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
which is owned by three other gangs that are in there as well.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
So, you have the three syndicates, the Vice Kings,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000
who are basically getting their money from strip clubs and record labels,

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
the Los Carnellas, who are a drug cartel,

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.000
and the West Side Rollers, who had basically an underground racing club.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:57.000
So, with that, of course, you're joined by some other lieutenants

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
that are part of the Saints.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000
So, you have Johnny Gat, Dex, and Lynn.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
So, as you're playing out through the game,

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000
you meet up with other characters and start taking over the city.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Come to find out, of course, spoilers, Julius, who is played by Keith David,

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000
ends up betraying you in the end and you get killed.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
What?

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Yes.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Spoilers.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Allegedly, you get killed when you come back in the second game, so it's fine.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Spoilers to the second game.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
These games are ten years old.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
No, but it was a great game.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:43.000
So, it wasn't revolutionary in the way that it was going to beat out San Andreas

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
or any of the Grand Theft Auto games,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000
but what I really liked about the game was that it was kind of a little more

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000
over the top than, say, like a normal Grand Theft Auto game,

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000
whereas most of the Grand Theft Auto games were kind of sort of focusing in reality,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
but they did a little bit of over-the-top stuff like the jet pack and whatnot.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Whereas Saints Row, they had a lot of different activities that were kind of over the top.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
This one was a little bit more crowded than, say, Saints Row the Third,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
which just kind of went crazy, but this one you had,

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
they kind of introduced some of the minigames in there.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000
They had insurance fraud, which basically you had to challenge yourself

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
in getting basically the most damage to the player as possible,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
so running out the middle of traffic, throwing yourself off bridges,

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
you know, anything to rack up a big insurance bill, which is kind of fun.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Hi, cat.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
He's like patting me on the leg.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Mr. Smoosh might want to come sit on your lap.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
He's all, pet me, pet me.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Mr. Smoosh might be trying to come sit on your lap.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
So then, you know, you have that.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
There's other missions like drug trafficking.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.000
They had, you know, where you can drop off, you know, prostitutes and stuff,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
just lots of ridiculous things.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Of course, also lots of download content in the game as far as costumes and whatnot.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000
And the first game I actually did play multiplayer

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
because it was like, you know, Grand Theft Auto game,

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
but it also had multiplayer built into it as well.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
So we used to play some of the death matches in there,

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
and they also had a mode called blinged out rides

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.000
where you had to basically bling your car out by getting more money and stuff.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
But it was a fun game.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.000
And I remember that they had a 30-minute demo that came out for the Xbox 360,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
and I would play the crap out of that,

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
and I found a way to get out of bounds in that game, and that was fun.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Some other fun stuff.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
They had a soundtrack of 130 musical tracks,

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
including the classical channel, which is great, especially playing that.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Of course, you know, drum and beat, metal, reggae, R&B, all that stuff.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Across 12 stations.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Let's see what else they had fun stuff about this.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000
I used to love putting in the codes in the game to get the cars to chase you down.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
They had lots of little cheat codes back.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
When cheat codes, you didn't have to buy them.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So that was fun.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.000
And of course, it spawned a few additional sequels.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:15.000
So you had Saints Row II that actually came out on both Xbox 360 and PC and PlayStation 3.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
So that was pretty awesome.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
And then, of course, Saints Row III, which came out on all three platforms as well,

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
and eventually got remastered for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And of course, Saints Row IV, which is just ridiculous.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
And hopefully they'll have a new Saints Row game.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Of course, you know, Gata to Hell was another one as well.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
But yeah, definitely worth checking out if you have an Xbox 360.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.000
It's old. I mean, it's sort of dated looking, but it was fun.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Alright, your classic game of the week.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
The original Saints Row before it went over the top.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Yes. And crazy.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
But that didn't make it... It was still... It was a decent...

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
It was a good game. I liked it. It was a good game.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
It was the start of something.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
And the story was actually not bad.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Like, one of the things like ever...

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
You know, some of the later games, I feel that the best balance in stor...

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Oh.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Okay, for those that just...

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Fucking asshole.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
So the cat just knocked over the trash completely.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I gotta go take care of that. Low-key.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
He jumped in the trash can.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
He jumped in the trash can?

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
He tried to jump in the trash can.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Fucking idiot. Hold on.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
So like, you know, I think the best balance in the Saints Row games

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
were probably Saints Row II, where it was kind of...

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
They had, you know, three different games that basically...

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Because you had died in the first game, but you didn't really die.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
You were just in a coma.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
And so you were in prison, and then you get broken out of prison.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000
And you know, come back to kind of reclaim Stillwater,

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
which has been taken over by three other gangs.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
But the way that you take care of those gangs is really fucked up.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000
And like, just some of the stuff you do to get revenge.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000
So that's why I think that one had like a great balance between crazy and realistic.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Plus they had a lot of mini-games in there that were just, you know, off the wall crazy.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
And what I liked about those games, and the first one included,

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
was that they kind of gave you context to the mini-games.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
They said, okay, here's why you're doing this mini-game,

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
and here's what the purpose is of it.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Not just, here's a mini-game you're doing to get money.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
You know, and if you do this, you get money.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000
And that's it. Like some of the further games do that, three and four.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:25.000
So I like the context being in there and just instead of recycling and stuff over and over.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
All right, thank you for buying me time, Loki.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Looking in chat at live.vognoteword.com.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, maybe Mr. Smoosh is trying to tell you something.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
What, throw this episode in the trash? Is that what you're saying, Tigerclaw?

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Why don't you say it to my face?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Bobby Blackwold says, my cat likes to knock over the trash can too because she wants to see what's in it.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Luckily, nothing, because Alan had just taken the trash out before he left, so that's the good news.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Let's see, Bobby Blackwold says, Mr. Smoosh is trying to say the Saints Row series was trash

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
until Saints Row 3, when it became really awesome.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Sjoan Hunter Matt says, Mr. Smoosh said, fuck your show and fuck this trash.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I'm hungry and want rubs.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Well, it's funny. I was sitting there and all of a sudden I feel his paw on my...

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
He's like, hello.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
That's what he does before jumping up there, so you dodged one there.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.000
And then Azet in chat says, cats are assholes. I don't know why you're surprised.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I'm not surprised, but does he have to do that now?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Of course he does. Of course he does.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Alright, we're going to take a quick break while I discipline Mr. Smoosh.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
We'll be right back after this quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Don't go anywhere.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Live tonight, episode number 722 already in progress for this March 11th of 2018.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
By this time next week, St. Patrick's Day will have already passed.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
I don't know. That was a really big deal when you were like 21 years old.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
But now it's like, eh, you know.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
My kids are very excited about it.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Yeah? Well, do they get to eat cookies and stuff?

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
How do kids celebrate St. Patrick's Day?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Usually what happens is...

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Wearing green, pinching their friends?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:15.000
No, the nonsense that they do, at least in the preschool, is they will go out to recess or whatever and play outside.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:21.000
One of the teachers will come inside and trash the place and they'll leave like green glitter everywhere.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
And be like, oh, the leprechaun came in and did all this.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Oh, that's cute. I like that.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Or they'll hide like gold or something.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Or they'll get the kids drunk.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
They'll get them drunk.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:37.000
They'll give the kids NyQuil and, oh, nap time's going to be three times as long so, you know, Miss Teacher can take a nap.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Alright, anyway.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Something I wanted to talk about before we get into rapid fire news.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000
This is more of a, like, kind of one of those things video game related that went viral.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Is that I guess, what, Google Maps did a Mario Kart thing.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Because yesterday, you know, next Saturday is St. Patrick's Day, but that means yesterday was March 10th, Mar 10, Mario.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000
It was Mario Day, right? Or at least I guess that's what people call it now.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000
That's what Nintendo would like you to believe.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
That's right. Well, now Google's getting in on this too, right?

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:12.000
So Google actually installed what, like something within their Google Maps apps that you could actually control it as Mario, right?

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Or when you, wait, I tell you that back. When you get your driving directions, because you can actually have the app show you, like, the driving.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Like it kind of like, ooh, this is how you go down the street and whoosh, you'd make a right turn here and a left turn here.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:32.000
But you can actually now have the Mario in his little kart be the thing driving down the street instead of the GPS arrow.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
That's kind of the big difference that they made.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
So how do you do that?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Let's see. Now you got to pull up the instructions.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
And I think it was only available for a limited time. It may not be there anymore.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Oh, but you can still access the Pac-Man stuff. I would have thought that they would have found it.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Well, let's see. In the Google Maps app, you have to, there's a question mark button on the bottom right of the app.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Oh, it's one week. They say it's going to be one week is around. There's a question mark button in the bottom of the app.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
If you don't see the block, make sure you've updated your app.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Oh, I probably need to update.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Then if you still don't see it, you just have to be patient because it's rolling out globally throughout the day, although I would think it would be done by now.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000
So, yeah, you can check that out and drive around as Mario from place to place.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Just a silly little thing, but we've seen Google and Nintendo work together before, right?

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Yeah, they did the Pokemon thing.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Yeah, which kind of turned into Pokemon Go, right?

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Wasn't there like a thought out there that that was what led to the original conversations on Pokemon Go?

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
I think so.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
That whole Pokemon and Google Maps thing? Oh, yeah.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Yeah, I don't have any updates for the map.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Well, it's got to be in there somewhere. Keep looking.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Yeah, Google Maps with the Mario Kart icon thing. I didn't even look. I just assumed it wasn't on iOS, but maybe it was.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I haven't seen an update come through for Google Maps in quite some time, though, so maybe, I don't know, maybe I'm behind, but we'll see.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I'll check it out and look for that. But first, we're going to get to some rapid fire news, right, Logie?

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:04.000
That is correct. So, let's talk a little bit about, let's see here, I'm going to have to open this back up again.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Speaking of modding and stuff, you know, Breath of the Wild has had a lot of mods come out for it, even though it is a Switch game.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.000
It also is a Wii U game, a Wii U game that is also run in an emulator on PC.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000
And so, with that, people have done all sorts of character mods with the game.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:35.000
We had CJ from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas in there, Sonic the Hedgehog, all sorts of crazy stuff.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Now, though, they have modded Link into Linkle. So, that's right, you can play as Linkle.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:54.000
And, you know, she's available in the game if you have a way to play modded games on your PC using the CEMU Wii U emulator.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And they've done some stuff, including, I think, support for, looks like the crossbow as well.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.000
So, she gets to use the crossbow and swords. So, pretty awesome.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:15.000
It looks like a, you know, something that they should have officially done, but, oh well.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:24.000
So awesome. And then, of course, getting into rumors and speculation.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Grand Theft Auto 6. There's an inside source that claims that Grand Theft Auto 6...

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Rumors and speculation from sources.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Known as Project Americas is apparently going to take place in Miami or Vice City.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:58.000
You know, honestly, I've seen so many rumors like, well, this is going to be Vice City for sure.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I don't think anyone knows.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:09.000
But my understanding, though, was they were talking about with Grand Theft Auto Online that they were going to have, like, it be all kind of tied together.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:16.000
So, you know, they were saying that maybe you would be able to travel to Vice City and Liberty Sea.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:21.000
I thought Liberty Sea was supposed to be something that they were going to do at one time as well, but who knows.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:29.000
They were saying that the game is supposed to be, could be released as late as 2022 and feature the first female lead character.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
2022 on the PlayStation 6.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:42.000
I, you know, it sounds so, like, bullshit rumor-y and, like, I don't know. I don't know.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000
So on the plausibility scale, this gets a 2 out of 5.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Yeah. Will there be another Grand Theft Auto game? Of fucking course there will be, because they made so much fucking money off of it.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Right now they're putting out Red Dead Redemption 2. So eventually, yes, there will be a new Grand Theft Auto game.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Is it going to be in Vice City? Maybe. Is it coming out before 2022? Hopefully. Is it going to have a first female lead? Maybe.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Like, I think these are all plausible things, but, like, is this, like, does someone really have insider information? Fuck, no they don't.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Because I could come up with bullshit like this. I've seen, like, where people are like, yeah, it's got to be in Vice City because then you can do Grand Theft Auto 6 and, you know, the roman numerals are V and I and you can have CE appear behind it.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.000
And it's like, oh, it's Vice City, oh, so clever. No, okay, come on. It's...

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Alright. Let's move on to something that's, it's more one of those half rumors, but it's more one of those, like, oh, people are jumping to this conclusion based on something that was said.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:37:03.000
And this one makes a lot more sense than some of the stuff you just went over. Apparently, one of the community managers from CDPR, who is behind CD Projekt Red, of course, behind The Witcher 3,

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
one of the community managers tweeted,

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Smash Brothers!

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Not Smash Brothers, but very close. Soul Calibur 6, which, okay, yeah, that makes a lot of sense, actually, that Soul Calibur 6 would be a good place for Geralt to land.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:49.000
That is a game, of course, in the Bandai Namco portfolio and, of course, we know there have been cameos in the game.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.000
You know, Link was in it one time, Ezio was in Soul Calibur 5, so it's not like Geralt would be, like, completely out of place there.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
He's gonna be in Ridge Racer.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:04.000
No, I don't think he's gonna be in Ridge Racer. Anyway, Soul Calibur is due this year, PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Perhaps that would be a great thing to reveal at E3, who knows?

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:19.000
And lastly, here in Rapid Fire News, I'm sure a lot of you have already heard about this, and for some people it's kind of sad news, for other people it's kind of, well, we were just waiting for this to happen.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Toys R Us, in a very bad position right now, and according to sources from Fortune, saying that they are probably going to close all their US stores.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Oh, that sucks.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Yeah, that's because Toys R Us has not found a buyer, so they are preparing for a complete liquidation.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000
It sucks, but I am gonna have to take advantage of all the sales.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Yeah, I mean, for those of you gaming fans out there, there could be some real deep sales on this stuff, but who knows?

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:53.000
I would think the newest and greatest games, they're gonna take that inventory and shift it somewhere else. The liquidators will move that inventory to somewhere that's gonna pay more for it.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Isn't it owned by Amazon?

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Toys R Us?

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Yeah.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
No, it's just Amazon put them out of business.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Oh, I thought that there was some connection with Amazon and Toys R Us.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
I think they have a partnership, but they don't own each other.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Oh, I was gonna say they could just shift all their stuff to Amazon.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Maybe, maybe, who knows? But I would bet this would be a great time for toys to figurines, like Amiibo.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:19.000
You know, if you wanted an Animal Crossing Amiibo, now's the chance, because even at Target, those Animal Crossing Amiibo are already showing up on the shelf.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:28.000
And it kind of doesn't surprise me. I mean, Animal Crossing characters. Like, of course, we know Isabel. We know Resetti, right? The owl that runs the museum, right?

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Okay, we know some of them, but they put out Amiibo for Animal Crossing that are like, who? Like, basic bunny and dipshit dog. Who are these people?

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Basic bunny.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.000
So, like, seriously, who are these people? So, there's lots of Amiibo that are being unloaded.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000
If I ever make a game that's like Animal Crossing, it's gonna have basic bunny and dipshit dog. Absolutely.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Thank you. Please, please, game makers out there, if you're making an animal game, I would appreciate cameos from basic bunny and dipshit dog.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
They can live in a, they're the slumlords of your town.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Alright, anyway, so that's, that's, I think, one thing you'd expect to see clearance on. You know, Disney Infinity, if there's any of those left.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
They were clearing, I think that stuff's gone by now.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Skylanders and the stuff that's still on shelves.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Skylanders, they were selling that stuff, I think, a buck a pop or something. It was, like, ridiculously cheap the last time I went there. They had a big dump bin of that stuff.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.000
I even considered, like, should I get Skylanders just because it's so damn cheap? I was like, no, no.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.000
I even thought about, like, the Disney Infinity stuff because they had the Finding Dory stuff. I was like, well, we don't have those.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Like, how often do we play Disney Infinity? Oh, never. Okay, so, yeah, I'm not gonna buy those.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Now, some folks in chat pointing out, Azet says they will jack up the prices before discounting.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Liquidation sales beware. And Rama kind of follows that with liquidation starts at retail price.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000
And Azet says you won't get discounts at the beginning. That is a good thing to keep in mind.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Any sale that was already happening will be done. Everything will be at retail price.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:05.000
And then, like, maybe for the first day, it'll be 10% off retail. And then the next, you know, three days, 20% off.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Then 30, then 40, and they'll probably, you know, keep knocking it down a little bit until they finally offload everything.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.000
But most people will have picked it clean by around the time, you know, 20% off happens.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Because I'm even thinking, like, I'm gonna go load up on Legos.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Fuck yes is what I was thinking.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:25.000
But the chatters are right. They're gonna mark up the price on those Legos to the maximum possible price.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Legos are, well, Legos...

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
And those are things they could offload to other salespeople too. You know what I mean?

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
They could transfer that inventory somewhere else.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:38.000
I'm usually pretty conscious of, like, what the deals are. I follow, like, a group that's Lego deals.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
So they, you know, will say, hey, this store is having a sale on this thing, you know.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000
And I haven't really, there's not too much that's come out this year to have, like, ooh, I really need to have that.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Rama also points out the Amazon and Toys R Us connection.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Amazon used to run Toys R Us's online site.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.000
And Azet is also stressing in chat, do your comparison shopping to see if it is actually a deal.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000
And I want to say they've got some plugin.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I know I had it at one time, a plugin for, like, Chrome or something like that.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.000
They'll actually price compare for you based on, like, you can go to, I think, Amazon or something like that

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000
and select an item and it'll tell you, is this the cheapest you can find it?

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000
You know, is it cheaper somewhere else? You know, and that type of thing.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:29.000
So I'm sure there's apps out there that do that kind of stuff and you can scan barcodes.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000
ActDef says it's called Honey. But I'm sure there's more than one.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000
I see ads for that all the time. I'm sure there's competitors too, even though that's good.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:41.000
But yeah, keep that in mind. And also, like, what you should do is if you're looking at, like, getting stuff,

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000
not being so impulsive about it, but, like, kind of have an idea of what you want to get

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000
and keep an eye on the price on that stuff and then, you know.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:53.000
But at the same time, here we are talking about how to pick Toys R Us clean like the fucking vultures we are,

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.000
but isn't it kind of sad that Toys R Us is going under?

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Yeah, I'm sad.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:02.000
I mean, no more stories about price tags that you have to take in the back and claim your games and stuff.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Plus, I think about all that retail space, like, what's, man, all these big stores have been closing

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
and what's going to go in these big retail spaces? It's kind of weird.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
It's just all online nowadays, it seems like.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I know.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
I mean, Circuit City's coming back.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Is it really?

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Yeah, it's an online store.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Oh, of course.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
But they're thinking about doing physical locations too, so.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Really?

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Yeah, so that was kind of interesting.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Maybe they could reopen one of that building that still doesn't have anything in it.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
They used to be the Circuit City over in, over by Sunrise Mall.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Maybe.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000
You know what I'm talking about, right?

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000
It's like a Halloween store once a year, but it still looks like a fucking Circuit City.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:43.000
No, they've got the one that's by, the one by Sunrise Mall, that's a Lumber Liquidators.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Oh, they finally put something in it.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Yeah, it's been there for a while.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Oh, I didn't know.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
But yeah, it's Circuit City.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
It's always going to be Circuit City because it looks like a Circuit City.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Oh, great.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Here comes Mr. Fuckshitup.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Yeah, Mr. Smush is whining about something, I don't know.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I'll go check his food supply and stuff in a minute here.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:00.000
But first, let's get to some release dates.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
And, Loki, would you mind doing the US releases?

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Then you'll probably want to get prepared to do the UK releases as well.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Sure, well let's do it.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
So this week we've got a few things coming out.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:12.000
We have the Devil May Cry HD collection on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000
A game called Golem coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Cube 2 on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Surviving Mars on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
The game I'm definitely picking up this week,

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Burnout Paradise Remastered coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
And last but not least, on the Nintendo Switch, Kirby Star Allies.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000
I'm sure we have at least one or two listeners that are interested in picking that up.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:46.000
I know of one that is probably importing it as we speak.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
In fact, actdeftinchat says, I'm picking that up.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Alright, going to Japan and checking out some of the releases in Japan this week.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:58.000
I think the big date over there is the 15th when we see stuff like on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:05.000
We're going to see the Silver 2425 as well as Galgun 2 in regular and limited edition.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
That is on PlayStation 4.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:13.000
As well as Shingeki no Kaioshin 2 in a regular and collector's edition.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Also this week, Winning Post 8 2018.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
If I'm not mistaken that is horse racing, right?

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Winning Post is horse racing?

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Yeah, I think so.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
I think so. I'm trying to bring up the box to confirm.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Yes, it is. So for you Derby Owners Club fans, there you go.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.000
And then Devil May Cry HD Collection is also out on the 15th.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
So pretty busy week on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Yep, still Vita releases in Japan.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Including Shingeki no Kaioshin 2 is also on the PlayStation Vita this week.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Checking the Nintendo Switch this week.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Galgun 2 is also going to be out on the Switch.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:56.000
And Winning Post 8 2018 as well as that same Shingeki no Kaioshin 2 is also there.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
And then Hoshi no Kirby Star Allies.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Same date as the US and Europe on the 16th.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Quickly checking the 3DS.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Who actually, yeah, 3DS even has some releases still.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Future Card Buddy Fight.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Tanjuu or Tachi no Saikyuu Body comes out this week on the 3DS.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.000
So you can fight alongside your little panda bear friends.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
It's a card battle game is what this is.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
So, neat.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
How about the UK, Logie?

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
UK's got some stuff coming out as well.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000
So we've got starting off with the Raven remaster.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000
That's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.000
We have a game called The Council Complete Season on Xbox One.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Devil May Cry HD Collection on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000
We have Surviving Mars as well coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Kirby Star Allies on the Switch.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Burnout Paradise Remastered on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:59.000
A game called Beast Quest on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000
And apparently, oh wait, that's the following week.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000
I thought that had been a little bit early.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000
That's it.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Alright, we're going to get back into some news here.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.000
But first, we're going to take a trip to the mailbag.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Every week, you guys email us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:30.000
And we dive into the mailbag and read some of our favorite letters here on air.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Except I had the stupid mailbag open earlier and I closed it somehow.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
How did I do that?

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000
I just had it up.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
My gosh.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Alright, well let's see if I can get, ah good, I got right by that.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.000
There's where browser history came in handy.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Thank you.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
We do have one email tonight.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Again, participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Let's get right into tonight's email which comes to us from Redertainment.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
A serial emailer, but this one's a good one tonight.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Who links us to an article from Polygon.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Please don't ever send me stories from that website.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Now look, just to be fair to Redertainment, I don't want to make Redertainment sad because I appreciate the emails we get from Redertainment.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Redertainment is about to make fun of this article.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000
So I guess under those stipulations then that would be okay.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000
However, don't send me links to that website.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Anyway, the story that was sent is the headline, Is Mario Still a Plumber?

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Wasn't this a while ago?

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
March 5th is when it was dated, it looks like.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Seems like so long.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
So Redertainment goes on in this email.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:50.000
This week a story broke that added more material to the discussion as to whether or not Mario is or is not a plumber.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
When I saw this story a question came to mind.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.000
A question that I'd like to pose to the wider Orange Lounge Radio community.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Followed by this in all caps.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
What the fuck does it matter what Mario's profession is?

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.000
In what way has Mario being a plumber affected any of the Mario games?

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Does Mario hit people with a pipe wrench? No.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Has Mario ever been delayed from saving the princess because he was busy snaking a drain? No.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Has Mario ever jumped into a pipe and then stopped from reaching the other end because he ran into a fatberg in the sewer? No.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Yes, you could say that the very existence of the pipe and Mario are due to him being a plumber.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.000
But those pipes are just a delivery method inside the levels.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000
If Mario was another profession something else would be used as the delivery method.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.000
If Mario was a letter carrier this delivery method would be a mailbox.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.000
If Mario was a pizza man the delivery method would be a pizza...

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
I totally skipped a sentence in the email.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
But you know what I meant. Mailbox, pizza box.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000
If Mario was a time lord the delivery method would be a TARDIS.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Even if Nintendo was adamant about using pipes as a delivery method,

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Nintendo would invent some other way to legitimize the existence of the pipes.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.000
For example, Bowser is one of those crocodiles that people think live in the sewers,

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000
so Mario uses pipes to go and battle Bowser the sewer crocodile.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Signed, Redertainment.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000
So what does Mario's job fucking matter is the question that's being asked here.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Well here's the thing, and I think you kind of missed this in your email,

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.000
because people don't talk about this game enough,

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:29.000
but before there was Super Mario Brothers there was simply Mario Brothers.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
And what happened in Mario Brothers?

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000
You've got to think back to that plot of that original game.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
What happened in Mario Brothers?

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:44.000
It was creatures coming out of sewer pipes that Mario and his brother Luigi had to stop, basically.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000
So they would knock the little turtles and stuff over,

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.000
and they would kick them off into the ocean or whatever that was supposed to be in the stage.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
The abyss, yes.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.000
So that's where the pipe stuff comes from, and I suppose in the context of those games,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000
I guess he was cleaning the sewers so that makes him a plumber? Okay.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Now before that he was in the business of being a kidnapper, or a donkey-napper, right?

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Because didn't he...

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.000
No, in the first game he's trying to save the princess from Donkey Kong,

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.000
but in the second game Mario fucking kidnaps Donkey Kong.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Mario gets his fucking revenge, doesn't he?

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:26.000
So I was a little surprised that he ended up being Mario,

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
but also in those games that guy was Jumpman.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
He wasn't Mario yet.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:38.000
So once Mario became Mario in the original Mario Brothers, there was plumber context to it.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000
So why do we have to fucking have that confirmed?

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000
That's what I don't understand. I'm not going to read that story,

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
but why do we have to have that confirmed?

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
When was this ever in any doubt that Mario was a plumber?

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000
And to be fair to Redotainment's question, what does it fucking matter?

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
It kind of doesn't.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000
He's right. I suppose some people like to get into the story, though.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.000
And you know, when the games used to come out on the NES, back in the day, Redotainment,

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000
way back in the day, and you might be too young to remember this, I don't know how old you are.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Back in the day when we bought video games, they came with these things.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
They're relics. They're called instruction manuals.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
You remember those? Instruction manuals?

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
And sometimes those instruction manuals will tell a little story

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
about what's going on in the game, and they might even have art that's going on in the game.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Sometimes the art looked way better than the game itself,

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
such as the original Mega Man. No, I'm kidding.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
But like the old Atari 2600 games, right?

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Had pretty kick-ass box art, and then the games themselves looked like Blocky the Block, Blockerson.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.000
So, what does it matter that he's a plumber?

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Those little instruction manuals were a lot of fun.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:47.000
People can have fun with their fan art on Reddit and stuff, but you're right.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.000
You would think, after all this time, maybe he'd wield a pipe wrench or something.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:58.000
But then we'd get in the Half-Life 3 rumors and we're not going to do that.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:05.000
It's just like this, okay? It's like, you've got porn star Ron Jeremy,

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.000
and if Ron Jeremy decided to stop doing porn,

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:14.000
he's still going to be a fucking porn star because he's goddamn Ron Jeremy.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:19.000
So, Mario is always going to be a plumber because that's the character that he was,

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:23.000
unless Mario's like, I fucking quit this plumbing job and I'm going to become...

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I don't know. What the fuck ever he's going to become. A carpenter or something.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Okay, okay. Rama in chat says,

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Rob Roberts, in the instruction manual for Super Mario Bros., Mario was listed as a citizen of the Mushroom Kingdom.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000
The plumber aspect came in for the Super Mario Bros. Super Show and the original Mario Bros.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Okay, but wait a minute. One of those things precedes the other by many years, okay?

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.000
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show was what, 88? I want to say it was like 4th grade or 5th grade that show was on.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:54:00.000
The original Mario Bros. was like 83? 82 maybe? I'd have to look it up on the wiki.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:06.000
The original Mario Bros. was definitely first before any of that stuff in the instruction manual or any of that.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.000
And that's where the plumber shit was, the original Mario Bros., right?

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.000
I feel like we've spent way too much time on this topic.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Alright, thank you Tiger Claw confirms 1983. Alright, so be it. Let's move on.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:29.000
That was it for emails. If you want to send us emails, participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to do it.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.000
In the meantime, Loki is going to get to some more news.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Yes. So, this was unfortunate if you happen to be an owner of an Oculus Rift, but they released a patch that broke the Rift.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Actually, they didn't release the patch. They had an issue with a security certificate that had expired.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:53.000
And so, because of that, it rendered all the headsets inoperable. That sucks.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:58.000
But thankfully, though, they did eventually fix it with the manual patch.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:10.000
And to apologize for the downtime, they did offer up anybody that had used their headset after February 1st would receive $15 in Oculus Store credit.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:22.000
I don't know. I feel that you should, if you're releasing hardware that can be broken that easily by a security update or something like that, that there's a problem.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000
I don't think you would have this problem with the Vive.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
The project manager left that off the spreadsheet, apparently.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:34.000
I mean, I just, I just like, I still have a problem with the Oculus Store being like a closed system anyways.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:39.000
But is it really closed, Loki?

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
It's still the principle of it.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:46.000
I have a problem. I just feel that this was handled by Valve or something like that.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:49.000
For one, it's not going to happen. This isn't going to happen.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:54.000
And two, that there would be just easier workarounds to get it working type of thing.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000
It wouldn't be like, oh, well, we're fucked, you know, until they fix it.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:05.000
I don't know. I just, I just think that there's more that they could have done to avoid this.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Well, this, this was a big deal that like anything remotely relating to, it wasn't just like people couldn't play games.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:23.000
But like, if you had to like touch an Oculus, like you were running an arcade that charges people to play Oculus, you were down.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000
If you were making games for Oculus, you were down.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:32.000
So this, this was something that, you know, this booboo affected everything, the whole system.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Yeah. Yeah.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:40.000
And I would think that they would have, well, now they know that not to make this happen again.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000
So hopefully this can be avoided in the future.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:49.000
So, you know, Bobby is saying his piece in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Bobby Leckl says, yes, the Vive would have the same problem. This is a Microsoft requirement.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Even Apple OS has the same security requirement. This is a base level OS issue.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Yes, they could have kept their certificate up to date. You are correct.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:08.000
But the HTC Vive has the exact same developer certificates that have expiration dates.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Some folks in chat bringing up potentially related circumstances.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000
RageNator saying years ago, wasn't there an issue of PlayStation Network or Xbox Live due to leap year?

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
And as such, the service went down.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Yep. That was PlayStation Network.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Yeah.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Because they can't calendar.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Well, sometimes when the odometer rolls over, it's like Gandhi and civilization.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Oh my God, it's Y2K.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Gandhi was supposed to be the most passive and not use the nukes.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:42.000
But unfortunately, that modifier caused when it went negative, that number would go negative in certain difficulties.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
That's not a bug anymore. That's a feature.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Yeah. And it rolled over into the highest positive possible and Gandhi would be the first to nuke your ass in civilization.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.000
That's hilarious.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:54.000
And still is. Now they've kind of embraced that. And like now they do that on purpose.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Basically.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.000
But everything's fixed now, right?

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Yes.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Alright.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Moving on to something about Zen Studios.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:15.000
This is an interesting story because you don't hear usually about studios canceling patches.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000
And so the patch for Pinball FX3 was canceled.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Yeah. Zen Studios was going to do a patch for Pinball FX3.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.000
And it was supposed to fix some framerate issues that the game has been having.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
They've canceled the patch.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000
In an announcement, Zen Studios said on social media,

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Hey guys, we might have been premature in the excitement surrounding the Switch release.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:40.000
We really think this is one of the best platforms to play the game and wanted to make it to everyone's liking.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:46.000
We've sat on this problem contemplating it for a long time trying to find a good way to up the frames per your request.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:50.000
We found that there was no universal method to do this.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.000
And each table would require a lot of separate work.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:58.000
The volume in we don't have the bandwidth for the graphics and the QA department right now.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.000
We really do apologize for us being a bit slow to properly address this.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.000
P.S. check out Son of Zeus though.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:09.000
We were able to better some of that table's problems in Camera 3 and 4.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:14.000
So basically, they don't have the time or resources to do a patch to fix some of these framerate issues.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I've noticed some framerate stuff when I've played Pinball FX, but it's not like game killing or game murdering.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I just kind of went, Oh, I guess this is just one of the drawbacks of playing on the Switch,

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
is that once in a while I'm going to do a little like, huh?

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000
But it's not that bad, if that makes sense.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Obviously it runs pretty smoothly flawlessly on my PC, and I don't necessarily have that same issue on my Switch.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
That's the big difference.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:46.000
It could be worse. You could roll out an anti-cheat patch for your game, like PUBG, and break everything,

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:50.000
and have all sorts of problems, and then have to backtrack that.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
But still, it's kind of interesting to hear a developer acknowledge,

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Yeah, there's some framerate issues, but you know what, we just don't have the resources to fix everything.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Maybe it's just because the Switch isn't the same hardware as the other stuff this game's running on,

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
so it's just one of those corners that's got to be cut.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Too bad.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.000
I still like Pinball FX, so I don't want to be too harsh on the company.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.000
I think this is just some of the reality of game development, is that I think a lot of us sit here and go,

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Oh, they can always fix it with a patch. They can do that with a patch.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Well, you have to be able to pay the people to make the patch.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:26.000
And if you don't have those types of resources, and you can't bring on those resources temporarily,

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.000
it's usually not something you want to do. It doesn't happen.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Or it could be even they've done it in the past where it's like,

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:41.000
We're going to spend, say, $100,000 to fix this via patch.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:47.000
That's what it's going to cost to develop this, but we're only going to make $50,000 as a return on this.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Is it worth wasting $50,000 on?

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:56.000
That would depend on the size of your studio, and I don't think Zen Studios is that big of a company.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:00.000
And are there that many people playing Zen Pinball on the Switch? I don't know.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I mean, the vertical mode is pretty awesome. If you haven't checked it out on the Switch, it's worth looking at.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And it could always be like they can't do it right now, but maybe later on when they have more resources to allocate to it, they could do it.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Or figure out what tables are the most popular and fix those first. I don't know.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Maybe that's why they did the Son of Zeus one, because that's the table a lot of people got for free,

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.000
because that week they released on the Switch, you could get that table for free.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:32.000
I think everybody now, you can't get that one for free anymore, but I think Sorcerer's Apprentice is the free one.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.000
So you get something for free.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.000
So anyway, just a few more stories, then we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, but first, Loki.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:46.000
So this is actually pretty cool. I like the whole announcement they were showing off with this.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.000
And I can't remember the last game. I think it was Far Cry 3 that they did on Editor 4.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Far Cry 5, they've got a new mode called Far Cry Arcade, and it's going to come with a map editor.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.000
So people are going to be able to make their own custom maps for the game with different objects,

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.000
and create new levels, and maybe even game types out of it.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.000
And of course, that's going to be pretty awesome.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:17.000
So yeah, Far Cry, they said, I remember even the original Far Cry games had map editors as well.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000
The last one I remember playing with was Far Cry 2.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.000
And I know that they had one with Far Cry Instincts as well on Xbox 360.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
I remember playing with that as well.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
But this looks really cool.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:31.000
It wasn't really on my radar as a game. I kind of wanted to play.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.000
But now that they mentioned this map editor and stuff, it kind of has me curious like,

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
hmm, that might be kind of fun to mess around with.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.000
So it might actually get me the purchase of the game. We'll have to see.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Very cool. Yeah, so there's like 7,000 different objects in there.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:53.000
And all these different user-created levels are going to be available, I guess, to play as you will.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
And they're going to have different modes.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Yeah, I'm really interested. Check this out when they see how creative people can get with this stuff.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Very cool. And the game, of course, comes out on March 27th.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.000
So I may have to pick this up.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Yeah, this sort of thing seems right up your alley.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:22.000
This kind of reminds me a little bit of some of the crazy shit they can do with, you know, like...

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Well, Bobby Black Wolf calls it Far Cry Mario Maker.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Sort of. Well, Far Cry, to be honest, they used to, this was part of the package with Far Cry.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:37.000
It's like, okay, you'd have Far Cry, the single-player game, and then you'd have this map editor and you could play multiplayer and stuff.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.000
And it was really cool. I remember playing with some of that stuff.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:46.000
But it was kind of limited. This, they said that they're not only going to release this stuff, but they're going to keep updating it as well, adding new things to it.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:53.000
So it kind of has that whole... what was their spin-off game? The Far Cry...

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I don't remember now. But yeah, like the kind of the tongue-in-cheek...

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Blood Dragon?

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Blood Dragon, yes. It has the Far Cry, Blood Dragon kind of vibe to it.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Like the screenshot that they show here, there's like a, looks like a guy about to punch a bear.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000
That spin-off game did really, that Blood Dragon did really well, though, so I'm not...

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Blood Dragon was a great game. It was just cheesy and weird, but I want more Blood Dragon.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Alright. Alright, and lastly tonight, you know, before we get to Skype calls over at Orange Laundry, all one word on Skype.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.000
I know video games have been in the media a lot recently.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.000
In fact, shut up. Don't spoil my story, you stupid auto-playing video.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
I thought these things were supposed to be blocked in Chrome. Oh yeah.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.000
I'm still on Windows XP on this computer, so Chrome is not actually blocking things.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Anyway, here's the deal. So, I know in the media a lot lately, we've heard about the video games.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Some people want to blame video games for causing all the violence and some of the serious problems we have in this country.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Which, to those of us that have been commentating on this stuff for over 15 years, it's like a broken record.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Well, it is a broken record. It's like the only question that killed that argument right there is,

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:01.000
do they have video games in the rest of the world? Yes. Then it's not the fucking factor.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Because we don't have this violence in other parts of the country where they have stricter gun laws.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:11.000
They have the same access to these video games. So, that is fucking null void.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Let's get on to the real topic now. Kill the whole thing in like five minutes.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I know, I know. But yeah, there was that whole meeting that they had at the White House, which was totally one-sided.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Because he's a fucking dumbass. I know, I know. Anyway, that actually wasn't what I wanted to bring up,

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:31.000
but because that happened, a lot of the media is saying, is the president onto something with this?

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Do video games cause violent behavior?

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Do we not ask the same question about why the rest of the world doesn't have this problem even though they have video games?

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Fuck no. Let's sensationalize.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:51.000
A psychologist named Patrick Markey did some research on this and showed that 80% of mass shooters didn't even show an interest in violent video games.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
In comments on this, Markey said,

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Apparently, what's interesting about this, images of the rifle that were in the game Call of Duty are from a lawsuit that Sandy Hook parents who sued Remington said the company bears responsibility for the killings of the 26 children.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Because the guy who shot, I don't want to say his name because I don't want to make him famous, the guy who shot those poor children at the school used that type of gun to do it.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:36.000
And so, in another comment here, one of the attorneys, Joss Koskoff, said,

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:57.000
So, they reached out for comment to somebody, I guess, that was in the Trump thing panel and didn't hear back on this.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:03.000
The ESA has commented that numerous scientific studies show there is no connection between video games and violence.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:10.000
And Markey actually says in his research, it shows that when a new violent video game is released, crime actually drops.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Because people might be taking out their frustrations on a video game, I would assume, or what's going on or something like that. I don't know.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:23.000
You would think there's a lot of people out there who kill people in video games so they don't do it in real life.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:36.000
It's dumb. To me, the connection between violent video games and people that shoot up other people is like saying, these people eat food.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Food causes murderers. That's about the same type of correlation that they could draw there.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:51.000
But, once again, do they have food in other countries? Yes, they do. Do they have murder rates like we do? No, they don't. That's not the fucking reason.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Kaijuto in chat says they can make the argument that violent video games get censored in other countries more than this country, not Canada.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:03.000
That would be my biggest thing to point at. Canada, though.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Anytime there's a problem about, you know, America. Canada, though. They're fine. Canada, though.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:18.000
And I know what you're thinking about. You're thinking about how Australia has a more stringent thing where Mortal Kombat wasn't allowed there.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:26.000
But they have that now, where they do have it. Australia also banned guns altogether. So, it's a little apples to oranges.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000
What about Japan? Yeah, great example.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Japan has, you know... The same games. The same games. And they have...

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Sometimes, actually, it should be pointed out, sometimes, in the interest of all fairness, Japan does do some censorship in games.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:50.000
And I'm thinking of Until Dawn, specifically. There was a scene in Until Dawn where it fades to black.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:56.000
And you hear the screaming. You didn't actually see it. And I think it's the scene where, spoiler alert, somebody gets cut in half.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Or did they? Ha ha ha. So, that scene, I do not believe, actually exists in the Japanese version of the game.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:09.000
So, there is some censorship that happens. But, Canada, though.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:16.000
I doubt that one scene in one game is gonna cause that much of a difference. Like, oh, I didn't see that guy cut in half.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I guess I'm not a murderer now.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.000
ActDeaf says, Japan has a strict policy on gore, though, like no dismemberment.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:31.000
And AkumaJP, who would have some authority on what happens in Japan, says, we do not have guns here.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:38.000
And movies had no violence. Yeah, and AkumaJP brings up a point on the movies, which I always kind of go,

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:45.000
why are we picking on games when movies are just as easily accessible and show pretty much all the same things, if not worse?

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Like, I understand there's something to be said about, oh, well, you take control in the games or whatever.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:53.000
But you're still playing, nine times out of ten, some type of story, some type of narrative.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:10:00.000
And the imagery, which is so terrible, is the same imagery they show in movies.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:09.000
And, again, Canada doesn't seem to have this problem. Canada also has a really diverse, like, political, like,

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:15.000
if you look at the equivalent of the cabinet for the president here, what would be the equivalent in Canada there?

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000
It's, like, really fucking diverse. It's so interesting.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Exactly, exactly. And it's just like you have a bunch of old people in the fucking Congress and shit that

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:33.000
don't have any fucking clue what's in actual video games and are making decisions based on what somebody tells them might be the reason.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
I mean, it's just like, I'm sure...

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:41.000
I just, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just cannot believe that, you know, the guy that supposedly runs this company

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:49.000
had that meeting so one-sided where, like, people were there who have not made or influenced a video game in their fucking life.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:59.000
And their money is made off of books written to bash video games that are sold to a core audience that believes this shit.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Like, it's just, it blows my mind.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
I'll tell you exactly how it works.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:09.000
They were there for profits. They were in this meeting for profits for themselves that have nothing to do with making...

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:19.000
It's because some dude went on Fox News to blame somebody else other than the guns because they're in the pocket of the NRA and so what happened there?

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Trump saw that and because Fox News basically tells him what to think, he's like, oh shit, it must be the fucking video games.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:35.000
And because he's a clueless idiot, he decided that we better have a meeting about this instead of fucking gun violence and about what laws we can do to stop that.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:41.000
And that's why we wasted this time with this circle jerk of a thing that is just not gonna go anywhere.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
I mean, the guy's so fucking clueless.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Dude, we need to have a rating system for movies, he said.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Do you not fucking know about the MPAA that's been around since fucking ever?

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.000
I mean, like, are you that fucking stupid?

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Here's the most basic thing. Again, I'm not trying to get political, I'm not, but I can't fucking help it.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Especially, you know what, you might think this political rant is not gaming related, but look what just happened in Washington this week.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Like, you know, that types of conversation leads to, should we ban video games?

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:16.000
You know, I don't think legally they can. The Supreme Court's set a precedent on that with the whole, you know, what happened here in California.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.000
However, yes, it does tie to video games. So if you think this shit doesn't affect you, like, wake up.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:27.000
And what blows my fucking mind about this is that, you know, I realize gun control and this stuff is a passionate issue for people.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:31.000
But I kind of thought, I thought we hit an agreement on all sides.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
We settled this back in the 90s.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:37.000
I thought we hit an agreement on all sides. Democrat, Republican, the folks.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:42.000
I thought everybody hit this consensus that no one needs a bump stock.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Like, I thought we've, I thought we've reached that. Like, everybody agreed on that at some point, right?

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Except the NRA. But the NRA is there to sell more.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.000
They are an organization that tries to sell more guns and sell things like that.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000
So, of course, they're not going to be for banning the bump stock because they want to keep selling them.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:00.000
So fuck the NRA.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:07.000
So, but my understanding is both Democrats and Republicans all agree bump stocks aren't needed, right?

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:15.000
So why haven't we still said they should stop, they should stop selling bump stocks?

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Why? Why is it still?

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.000
It's because...

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
How many months has it been since Vegas?

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:21.000
It's because a lot of the...

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000
It's still...

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Because politicians like being career politicians.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:29.000
And in order to be a politician, they have to have money to run their campaigns.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Where they get this money from? The NRA.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Please, please, please vote and throw these fuckers who can't do shit out of office.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Anyway, sorry. Thank you for the hug.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Go over and chat at live.vognetwork.com.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.000
We're going to open up the Skype line.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:58.000
I'm sure some of you want to comment on this.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Or really something else would be okay too.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
If you want to comment on something else, that is completely okay.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Or you can, of course, call us on the old school phone, 1-877-GAMO-LR.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Let's see. I'm going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:21.000
I guess the good old lawyer, Jack Voldemort, as we call him here on the show,

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:25.000
tried to inject himself into that White House debate.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
I had read that too, S. Jonah and Matt.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:30.000
I read that somewhere that he was trying to get in on that.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
I don't know if that was like an onion satire thing or if that's...

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.000
But I would think that guy is so fucking irrelevant that this is one of those things that he could probably cling to.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Like, oh, I fought these video game industry people for years.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Have a seat, bitch!

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
And that's my message to Jack Voldemort.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Let's see. Also in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Act F says, can you remember the call a while ago about Mexico doing a rating system?

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
This pretty much feels like it.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
And we have a gun ban too.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Let's see. Akuma JP says, vote.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.000
If Trump can happen, I don't believe in vote no more.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Akuma JP, look at how many people voted and where.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.000
And that's why things happen that surprise people.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:20.000
And Dungeon Muster also points out the Electoral College voted him in.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Not necessarily the popular vote. That's a very interesting perspective on that as well.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Yeah, well, one battle at a time.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
All right. Anyhow, let's get to the calls.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Maybe our caller has something else and gets us off the political stuff.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Hi, you're on Orange Mountains Radio. Who's this?

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Hey, this is Regineer.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Hey, Regineer. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Well, two topics. I'll make my original topic the second one.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Your discussion kind of takes a little precedence.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
I think it's a little bit more important.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:16:02.000
My local CBS affiliate ran a story on the video game topic just the other day.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:10.000
In fact, I ended up contacting via Facebook with the response pretty much two cents in.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:20.000
And, you know, I basically said so many words to them that, you know,

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:28.000
they're just, you know, the politicians and what they are just using video games is a convenient scapegoat.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:35.000
If you think about, you know, violence in media is nothing new.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:44.000
You know, we had violence in movies and TV, case in point, the Godfather movies,

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:51.000
the old westerns from the 50s and 60s where there were shootouts left and right.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:56.000
And I can go on and on and on.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:00.000
An orgy of violence has been in this culture forever, yes.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Yeah, even in literature, has anyone ever read Shakespeare?

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Hello, Othello, Hamlet, everyone dies.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:14.000
You know what else is kind of violent?

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:17.000
And again, I'm going to open a huge can of worms with this, so I'm really just going to leave it at this.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:22.000
But like, some of the Bible is pretty violent, too. I'm just saying.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:31.000
I just noticed some of the things they teach us with are not always the kindest and sunshine and rainbows types of stories.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:36.000
And I'm just gonna leave it at that. I know that's very controversial, but I mean, I don't think I'm saying anything wrong.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Some of the stories in the Bible are pretty brutal.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Now, here's a rhetorical question. Have you ever heard of an instance where someone had read Hamlet and decided to go on a shooting spree?

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:55.000
I sure as hell haven't.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.000
I don't think anyone got shot in Hamlet.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Well, the point being, you know, no one's not now read those plays and what that decide to murder people or anything like that or read Romeo and Juliet decided to commit suicide.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
I mean, you know.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Now, the difference, the only difference that comes to mind between video games and these other forms of media is that video games, relatively speaking, is still relatively new.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Video games, commercially speaking, have already been around since, what, 1971, 1972, thereabouts?

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:49.000
And also, generally speaking, generationally speaking, who's in power right now? Baby boomers, right?

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:59.000
By the time video games start coming around with Space Warrior and Pong and all that, these baby boomers were already adults.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:05.000
They weren't exposed to video games when they were kids like us.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Here's what it is. Here's what it is, Raginator. I appreciate your points, but I'm going to break it down real quick.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Here's the deal, is that, you know, in our culture, we want to blame somebody else and accept no personal responsibility for some of the things that happen.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:28.000
And, you know, right now it's blame the video games. And there was a time and place when people wanted to ban books. I mean, they still do.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:34.000
You know, books like Catcher in the Rye and shit, like people, and there's been commentary that's been done on this.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Like the book Fahrenheit 451 kind of takes the whole book burning thing and does the whole thing with it.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:43.000
So our culture has always been obsessed with blaming something else besides ourselves.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:53.000
But the reality is, and well, at least my reality and the way I view all this stuff is, and I'm pretty sure most people would agree with me on this.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Everybody's got this little thing inside, this little switch inside them. And most people, I think, would call it a moral compass.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:07.000
And that moral compass tells you what's right and wrong. And, you know, like most things in the world, it's a little bit of a spectrum, right?

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Some people are always going to adhere to that moral compass. They're not going to break any rule. They're not going to do anything that, you know, breaks that moral compass.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:19.000
They're not going to have sex before marriage and they're not going to, you know, whatever their religion tells them, they're not going to violate any of that stuff.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:25.000
They're going to adhere to that moral compass, you know, strictly. Some people, it's a little more of a gray.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Oh, I fucking jaywalked it. Oh, I said the F word, whatever. But at the end of the day, I like to think I'm a pretty good person.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:41.000
And that moral, that moral compass and so forth. There's also a little part of that switch is the little switch that's like, is it a good idea to murder somebody?

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Like actually murder or let's just say hurt somebody. Is it a good idea to physically harm another human being?

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:54.000
And the good news is, Rage Nator, I think for most of us, that switch is in the no position.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:08.000
But unfortunately for some folks, and that ain't the video game fault, that ain't the movie's fault, that ain't anybody's fault, but the person who chooses to hurt another human being.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Exactly. And not only that, but to touch on a point that was being made earlier, video games have ratings on them.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:26.000
You know, they've had ratings since the early to mid 90s. You know, they have the call ESRB ratings going on.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:46.000
And every package since then, the rating on the front, clear as day and descriptors on the back, tell you exactly why that game has that such and such rating.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:22:06.000
And to the best of my knowledge, no store, including GameStop, will sell an M rated game to a kid unless the parent is physically there.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:19.000
And then the employee will tell the parent what the rating of the game is and why the game has a rating.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Well, Rage Nator, GameStop does indeed have that policy in place that they don't sell M rated games to kids.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:36.000
But some of the employees at GameStop, their moral compass might tell them, eh, fuck this place. I'm just here because I need a job.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Get the hell out of here, kid. It's the only way I'm going to get rid of you to sell you this game. Give me your money and get the fuck out of here.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Yeah, you know, I think, you know, both you and Loki had not necessarily tonight, but have coming in shows past where, you know, sometimes, you know, you know, a parent could be at a store with their kid.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:14.000
And, you know, let's call the kid Little Johnny and, you know, Little Johnny will say to mom, hey, I want this new GTA game.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:22.000
You know, they'll, you know, take, you know, the game to the counter. You know, the employees say, hey, this game is rated out for mature.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:33.000
This is why, you know, why is rated that way? And the perils say something to affect. I don't give a shit. I want my kid wants this game. He won't shut up until he gets it.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:43.000
That's all that is. Yeah, absolutely. And that is between the parent and the kid. And then if that kid goes and does something, I bet that parent is going to be the first one to blame everything else.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Yeah. And then, you know, I think also, you know, if I remember right now, correct me if I'm wrong, but, you know, something was said after that, you know, where they, you know, we're coming back, you know, hours later or days later or whatever,

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:14.000
with the game toast, you want to make a return and say, oh, my God, this game has this, this and this in it. I want a refund. How could you sell this to my kid?

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:22.000
As an old boss of mine said, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Well, enough of my original, you know, this topic. I want to get to the my second one before you close out.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:36.000
I'm actually going to go ahead and let you go. We're already up on ten minutes on this call. I got to give time for others to get through. But feel free to send us an email. Okay.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:43.000
Sure. Sounds good. All right. Take care, buddy. All right. One eight seven seven game all our username on Skype, which is the way most people do it.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call and talk about anything that's going on in the news this week. In fact, there it is.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Lighten up. I knew we'd have more calls coming in. That's why I had to let poor Reginator go. But hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Hey, this is Act Deaf.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Hey, Act Deaf. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Well, pretty much continuing what the topic is right now.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.000
That's all right. We brought it up. So let's talk about it. What's on your mind?

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Yeah, it needs to be discussed.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:13.000
But you're not in America. So you may have a different perspective on all this.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:36.000
And there's exactly a different perspective because we also have people down here like they say, oh, video games are bad for you. Like I was saying in my one of my calls previously that they want to do a rating system down here because, oh, well, children are getting influenced by video games and they're bad because they make them violent.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Can I jump in here real quick? Because I mean, I want to ask you this because and I know you're just one person in a very big country. But can I tell you that the perception of many Americans, the perception of many, many Americans is that Mexico is a more dangerous place than the U.S.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:08.000
And that Mexico has these drug cartels that behead people. And for that reason, we don't vacation at what is that play Playa del Carmen or whatever is that place that they told people not to go to just this last week?

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Yeah, I think it's Playa del Carmen. And I'm not going to lie, Mexico is a dangerous place. And I do see like in newspapers, news sites over here that, oh, people got beheaded or someone in the cartel got caught and many are dead.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:50.000
And it's like daily basis. But it's pretty much contained if something and only in certain areas, like if and especially like where I live. And it's next to the border. So it's like really close to the United States.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:27:09.000
You can see like people like getting assassinated or getting killed every day. But in comparison even to like this year in the United States, the United States has had way more killings than we do.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:37.000
And just my hometown, it's crazy. It's like, wow, I don't understand. And going to the video game thing, I have to thank video games for like teaching me how to read Spanish, learn English and speak English, write in English. I have a lot to thank video games for.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:53.000
I think if I worked with video games, I wouldn't be like right here right now talking to you. I wouldn't have a job because because of video games, I learned English and I teach English for a living. So yeah, I don't know how exactly how

02:27:53.000 --> 02:28:06.000
that's a great point. That's a great point is that we oftentimes neglect all the great things that video game has brought our culture because I firmly believe this video games are art and art enhances culture.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:15.000
And some of us, you know, we have been I have met you act after you've been a great listener and support for many, many years because we're both kind of into video games.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:29.000
And you're right, without video games, I probably wouldn't know who you are at all in this life. And video games have brought that together. And just like the video games have brought together people, couples that met playing World of Warcraft and going on adventures together

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:40.000
and deciding, hey, we should like go on a date offline and see what happens. And then they get married and have World of Warcraft babies like video games have had that impact on our culture.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:53.000
And a lot of that is pretty amazing. And you're right, video games can also be used to teach. Video games have been used to teach for many years. We always, always on this show talk about the Oregon Trail and Number Munchers.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Like these were games that fucking impacted us big time as we were growing up, you know, and like like kids that are Loki's kids age are going to think that way about Minecraft and the stuff that they're learning on now.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:19.000
And it's all because of parenting. It has to be good parenting. Every good teaching, and I know this because, again, I'm a teacher, comes from home. You can go to school, you can learn a lot of stuff.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:32.000
And even like right now with all the teaching methods that exist right now, all good teaching comes from home. All good manners, all the good stuff has to come from home.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:59.000
So if anybody doesn't have that, of course, they're going to go berserk or going to do crazy things. It's like basic principles. And again, it's like baffling to see many people blaming other stuff for especially video games or any media in general, blaming people or reining, oh, it's because of this. No, it's not.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:10.000
So you're basically saying some of that moral compass I brought up earlier, a lot of a lot of that is shaped and and and made and melded while you're growing up in your home.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Exactly. Yeah, that's pretty much it.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:18.000
All right. I'm gonna let you go to try to get more calls, but I really appreciate your perspective on this.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.000
One more thing.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Yeah, of course.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
People need more curvy. That's it.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Well, we'll all have the chance next week.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Yeah.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:26.000
All right. Take care, my friend.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Thanks for having me.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Bye.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:31.000
All right. One more call and we're going to call it a night.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Hello. You're on Orange on Radio. Who's this?

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:35.000
It's Rama.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
Hey, Rama. How you doing, my friend?

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:43.000
I'm doing good. I mean, I had to jump in on this.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Now, I want you to know I have been listening to this show for a long time.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:51.000
You have been listening to show for a long time, and I appreciate.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:31:00.000
I was just thinking my trip to New York when I met you and SSG100Matt and like people that I don't even think listen to this show anymore, like Sephiroth1215 and stuff.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
That was ten years ago.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Yes.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Ten years ago.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:10.000
And I've called in and I've said this before.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:17.000
OLR is more than just a show about at first DDR and now games.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Yeah, it's a show about food and dieting.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Weren't you listening earlier?

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Well, I kind of missed the first part because I was underground because Signal kind of sucks when you're on an underground train, you know?

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Oh, and real quick, I am told by SSG100Matt that Sephiroth1215 still listens via podcast. Well, shout out. Thanks for your support as well.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:38.000
That is awesome.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:39.000
That is awesome.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:48.000
And there have been many times you have brought up non-gaming topics that we have all said it's political, but it's not.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Because it's stuff that has to be discussed because it impacts our hobbies and what we do.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Yes.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:05.000
And this whole video game violence thing, I'm just like, whatever he is smoking, that's a strain that I don't want because I know it'll screw me up.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
I will say this about video games.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:22.000
If it wasn't for me having my first computer at the age of four, which led me to the Atari, Nintendo, and so forth, I probably would not be this nut about hardware and technology doing IT support.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:25.000
I might be doing something else. Who knows?

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:36.000
When I was living with my god sister for about two years and my nephew, he would sit there and play GTA 3 all the time and he freaking loved it.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:40.000
But mind you, the kid at the time was 12, 13.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:48.000
But he knew that this was fantasy and you can't go out and walk up to somebody's car, throw them out, take the car and drive off.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
It doesn't work that way.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:54.000
That's something that my god sister instilled in him.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:57.000
That's something that I instilled in him.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:06.000
And let me tell you, when I was in the Marines, when we had downtime, we would be sitting there playing Battlefield, Call of Duty, this and that.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Yes, we know it's a fantasy fun game, but it was for shits and giggles.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:12.000
There were guys I knew who were actually out in the front lines.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:13.000
What were they doing on downtime?

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Playing Call of Duty, playing Battlefield, Street Fighter.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
It was just fun and games.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Yeah.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:22.000
I just have to say, it goes back to the home.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:23.000
I'm sorry.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:36.000
If your kid is coming out saying that, if your kid is playing video games and thinks this is how it works in real life, you need to sit down with your child one on one and tell them this is fantasy.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:42.000
If the teachers are telling your child that it doesn't work that way, do not blame the teacher.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
It comes from the home.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:54.000
I don't want to put myself out there, but I grew up in that neighborhood where the name of the game was Duck and Cover.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Because if you didn't duck and cover, you would catch a bullet in your head.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Because it could have been a stray bullet. Who knows?

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Video games gave me that outlet where I wasn't allowed to go outside and play.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Because God forbid, I went outside and played with my friends.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Someone would get shot and I would be that person.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:20.000
So my great grandmother, Lord rest her soul, got me a Nintendo and said, I will get you whatever games you want.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
I just don't want you outside.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Yes, as I got older and I understood what was going on, I went out and did what I had to do.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:32.000
But growing up, I was at home in front of my TV playing Super Mario Brothers 3, you know?

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:38.000
So I'm only not talking because I'm so captivated by your story right now.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Because it's heavy. It's heavy, Rama.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:52.000
This is a story that people out there who are writing books to profit off of the negativity that they put out there about video games.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:57.000
This is a story that they need to hear. Video games have fucking saved a lot of people.

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.000
Yeah, I don't mean to sound heavy.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:05.000
It's fucking honest, Rama. It's honest.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:13.000
And I appreciate that. And you're given a perspective here that not a lot of people have had or are going to...

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Your reality is no one else's reality, if that makes sense.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Just like my reality is not your reality and all that stuff, you know what I mean?

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:29.000
Yeah, I get that. When the time comes when I have kids, they're going to play the same games that I did.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:36.000
And they're going to know, you cannot do this in real life. Because if you do, it ain't the police you gotta worry about.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:45.000
It's me you have to worry about. Because it's going to be a punishment and discipline that I realize I might or might not have failed as a parent.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
But that means I have to do better.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:52.000
I believe the line you're looking for is, I brought you into this world and I will take you out.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:56.000
If I had a nickel for every time I heard that growing up.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Lord, I used to say for a while, if you look up ass-whooping in the dictionary, you see a picture of my sorry face.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Mm-hmm. No, I hear you. It was different in my household. It wasn't necessarily like physical violence, but it was a lot more like mental anguish.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Give me a reason to come in there or something like that. Yeah, I got that. Believe you me.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Mm-hmm.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:32.000
I mean, honestly, video games is just an outlet to get away from the bullshit that is day in and day out life.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Whether you are a student in regular school and you're tired of this and that, you don't want to do your homework.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Whether you are a college student and you're trying to get yourself some free time.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Whether you are an adult and you're like, you know what, my boss just got on my last nerve, so you know what?

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:54.000
I'm going to sit right here, play some Final Fantasy XIV with my squad and have a good time.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:04.000
And as realistic as the games can get, we just got to remember, it's just plain fun.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:11.000
At that point where you're walking up into the bodega, holding out a thing of gold, saying you want this.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:16.000
I got to tell you, we need to pull you aside. We need to sit down and have a good talk.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.000
Absolutely.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Yeah.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Rama, thank you so much for the call and the perspective. I appreciate it.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:28.000
And it's just, it's one of those things I think we all know it.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:32.000
If you're here listening to Orange Launch Radio because you enjoy video games that much.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:36.000
That you're seeking out a podcast where people talk about video. We're not even playing them.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:39.000
We're not even Twitch. We're not playing them right now. That's what you see on Twitch.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:40.000
We're just talking about them.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:44.000
If you're out there and you seek out a podcast where people just talk about video games.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Like you clearly feel some of this too, that we have.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:51.000
And video games probably helped you out in some way as well.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:56.000
And so that's why I think a lot of us get really angry when we see our industry get scapegoated.

02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:00.000
For, you know, some of this like bullshit that we don't want to be associated.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:06.000
In fact, video games are the thing that we took to to escape some of that bullshit.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.000
So y'all are passionate and I get it.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:15.000
I'll say two more things. I'm going to get up on out here because we know there's going to be one more person that's got to say this.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Like, number one.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:25.000
Like I said, I don't don't thank me. Don't think Raginator. Don't think Act F.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:33.000
We thank you because these topics is what separates OLR from other gaming podcasts.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:36.000
It's a bit of real life coming in.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:41.000
And you've got to understand if we don't talk about what goes on in real life.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Real life, it can affect your hobbies as a whole.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
You can't just ignore that.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
And number two.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:52.000
I really, really appreciate that.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:57.000
I do feel other podcasts address real life issues in their own way.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
But every dinner table is different.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:02.000
And, you know, this I wouldn't have it any other way here.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
And I appreciate you.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
You know, we don't I say I say this every week.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:12.000
You know, we don't have the audience that giant bomb cast or I don't even know who the other big players are anymore.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:16.000
IGN. I'm not saying we don't have the numbers of the one up show.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:19.000
And I'm oh, wait, that's website. I've been around for like 12 years.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Maybe we do have maybe we actually maybe we do have those numbers.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:31.000
Just, you know, somewhere in storage when when they had like this, some gaming convention here in New York City years ago, I one up was there.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:35.000
There was a pic. I have like a little one up ID badge card of me cosplaying kills.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.000
It's somewhere in my storage. OK, yeah.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:42.000
No, I remember how I see that and.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Whatever those big I look at this with the big gaming podcast, that's like having a ticket to see.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Share. Well, you know, someday, someday we might become the number one radio or podcast in Sacramento.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Sacramento. But unfortunately, unfortunately, that space is taken at this time.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:07.000
Yeah, no, I don't make claim. It happens. No, I totally get I totally get it.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Like giant bomb cast. That's like share. We're like that underground thing that somebody wrote a zine about.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:21.000
Yeah, you're you're you're like like mega ran in the crew at this local spot.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:25.000
And when you that is a fucking compliment. Mega ran is fucking amazing.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.000
I will take that compliment and hug it, except no one knows us like mega ran.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:33.000
So that's true. He's a mega. Randy is more popular, but that's all right. It's fine.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:37.000
It's like Rob opens up the curtain and expect to see one.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:42.000
You know, there's like a hundred of us just chillin, just waiting for y'all to perform.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:47.000
After the show, it's like Rob will sit, sit on the edge of the stage.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Let me tell you some real shit right now. And it's it's like MTV unplugged in a way.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:57.000
It's like you're getting real at the words. It's like you're hanging out at the merchant table.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:01.000
We're buying and you're just talking to us like we bros.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:07.000
That's the best way I can I do. And this is that's part of the reason why I come in and do my best to listen.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Whether I am at my studio here listening while editing photos or I'm coming back from hanging out with my squad in Jersey for a convention.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:20.000
As soon as I get uptown, I fire up TuneIn Radio to listen in to see what's going on.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:31.000
Or if I know I'm going to be out and I can't be back in time, I'll message Dark Soccer about, you know, for the classic game so I can have it ready when I go home and do it.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:38.000
And when it comes to games, if it wasn't for me being enjoying video games, I never would have discovered Ronma one half hard battle.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:43.000
I never would have found the American version. I never would have gotten into the anime cosplay.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:47.000
And I never would have been listed as a as a Ronma super fan.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:42:01.000
And I'm on the Blu-rays and I never would have gotten so many friends and many fandoms.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:07.000
And. God damn it, Ron, you're making me cry.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:10.000
I didn't I didn't say a goddamn thing, Ronma.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:14.000
But I feel I know I feel you. I feel you so hard right now, Ronma.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:32.000
And I understand because like sometimes I think without gaming culture, without like the Internet and what I've been like, I sometimes feel like without like getting introduced to technology and that culture like Ronma, I would probably have a wife.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:44.000
In a house like and think what I mean when I'm saying that I would probably have a wife and heaven forbid kids in a house somewhere in like Connecticut.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:53.000
And like my wife would be so unhappy in this marriage that she'd be buying a PlayStation five to fuck her.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:43:01.000
So I had to bring it full circle somehow. But there is no there is a serious point that there's absolutely serious point to that is that I oh my God.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Like me too. Yo, the video games helped me in a big way.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:12.000
And I just I wish those stuffy old coots up in the White House would realize that as well.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Yeah. And it's like I said on like in a chat room a couple of weeks ago, I know people are shitting on Secret of Mana, but Secret of Mana got me through a really tough time in my teenage years.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:35.000
And no matter how people are going to shit on it, if I can get myself a SNES classic, just remember this is this this is where I was trying to deal with my teenage angst or I pick it up.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:43.000
And then when I get my PS4 and I sit there and I shed a tear remembering this is the game that got me through one of the toughest times in my life.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:53.000
And you know what? And that's that's why when people like to talk about like these horrible video games and things that, you know, well, it's just like how how Dark Sakura and myself and even Loki a little bit.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:57.000
We always stick up for the guardian legend, even though it's an NES game that people don't remember.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:07.000
Like you got memories tied to things sometimes and you're going to defend that game till the fucking last day because it helps shape who you are.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:12.000
And when somebody attacks it, it's attacking who you are.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:19.000
It's kind of like, you know, on a related but oddly similar note, oddly, oddly similar note.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:25.000
It's like when people attack the Rocky Horror Picture Show and that whole community, because you all know that's been a big part of my life, too.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:30.000
And I've been doing that on and off for many years. And I have a lot to thank that community for as well.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:34.000
And I mean, like it doesn't really have shit to do with the movie, the movie.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:39.000
It's a bad movie, but it's the community saved my life.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Like I can literally say that community saved my fucking life.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:49.000
And without, you know, that community, I would have met Travis who would have podcasting with me and all that other stuff.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:59.000
So anyway, not to get on a tangent, but like when I see people like attacking that community or like these like Tumblr brats who talk about like all the problematic shit and stuff.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:04.000
I'm like who haven't even gone and experienced it for themselves. I get really irritated.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:17.000
You, you, when it comes to those goddamn Tumblr rights and my fandoms and cosplaying this and that, the old guard, we just want to sit there, gear up, take them out.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:25.000
I'm like, nope, nope, nope. We should get up in the stands, stay up in the cheerleading section, balcony, whatever. Just eat our chips.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Watch the Tumblr likes destroy what we create. Then we come back downstairs and be like, you wrecked it. Now will you listen to us?

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Here's the thing. I think you can challenge things and make it better. I think you can do that.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:41.000
But a lot of it is in how do you deliver that message?

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:45.000
Like, you know, again, I'll go back to Rocky with one thing is I was fortunate enough.

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Like I've kind of like I made it with that where I got to host a panel at a local convention here that actually had three of the actors from the movie, including Barry Boswick, who's prolific with a lot of other things he's done.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:05.000
By the way, actually, I get to do it again on April 20th. We're actually doing Rocky Horror here in Sacramento live with Barry Boswick.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:12.000
So cheap plug. But anyway, I've been fortunate enough to do a panel with him and the actress, Patricia Quinn, Magenta and now Campbell, who played Columbia.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:20.000
And one of the things that came up at the panel, the reason why I bring this up is, you know, they were asked, is there something they don't like about what this turned into?

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:25.000
Is there something they don't like? And something they kind of said is that, you know, well, we've kind of seen some of the midnight screenings and things.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:32.000
It feels like some people are just trying to be there to swear as much as possible and say fuck and interject their stuff as much as possible.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:38.000
We just kind of wish, like, it would be, you know, like the callbacks, like, of course those are going to happen, but they should be smarter.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:46.000
And I know after I heard them say that, I was like, you know, they're right. Like, this shouldn't be a contest about yelling as many incoherent lines as possible.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:53.000
Like, it should be like any good joke. Like, hit them hard and hit them heavy with a real good joke.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:57.000
But then you just back off for a little while until you have another real good joke. You know what I mean?

02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:04.000
So my point with that is, ever since then, I've really kind of went with Rocky to just, I don't necessarily have to yell something at every part.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:09.000
But I'm going to just yell like the 20 funniest things I know when the movie's going on, if that makes sense.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
Yeah, it actually does.

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:18.000
So anyway, Rama, I cut Rage Nator off after 10 minutes and here we are going on 15.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:25.000
But your call was awesome. Of course, all the calls we get here are awesome, but I really appreciate you and your perspective.

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:32.000
And I can't thank you enough for the kind words that you give us here that, and everybody really out there, I know you're the one that's here now,

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:41.000
that really are the fuel as to how we're able to punch in and do this across 722 weeks like we've been doing it.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:44.000
I appreciate you guys so much. You don't even know.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:53.000
I just wanted to call in just to tell you, you're not getting political. To me, it's not political because it's topics that do affect us.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:48:00.000
And sometimes we got to put the controllers down, pick up the pens and paper, and we got to talk about this real quick.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:03.000
Then we can go back to playing Street Fighter, you know?

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:12.000
I guess maybe a lot of it, Rama, comes down to the whole, you know, kind of that same line I just mentioned about in how you deliver the message.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:18.000
Because I realize there's many people out there that voted for the, obviously, or who wouldn't be president,

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
there's many people that voted out there for him.

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:27.000
And I come in this really rough place because I have to accept that there's people that are going to have other perspectives.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:33.000
And even though I sometimes really want to be angry about it because I think,

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:41.000
how could you vote for a vice president like that guy that is really against me as a person over something I can't control, right?

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:45.000
There's that part of me that gets really angry, but it's like,

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:52.000
but I'm not going to change minds by screaming at this person what a trash bag they are.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
True, true.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:49:00.000
So I have to try to, like, respect the position even when I don't understand it.

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:04.000
So I hope you all understand that's what I try to do with some of the politics on this show is that I realize,

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:09.000
you know, there's probably some real, there's probably some people, if they haven't tuned out already,

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:12.000
there's probably some people out there that fucking love guns that are out there.

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:16.000
And I don't get it, and it's one of those things I'm trying to respect it,

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:21.000
but at the same time now y'all are coming from my community, the video game community,

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:27.000
and no y'all, there's a real gun issue in this country.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:31.000
And as I said earlier, everybody agrees, bump stocks, bad.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:35.000
So let's at least start there. Like, why is this so difficult?

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:38.000
That's what I'm having a real hard time understanding right now.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:44.000
Let me say this, I'm hell up on out here. I serve Marine Corps. I shot weapons.

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:48.000
I have actually gone out to the range and shot weapons for fun.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:54.000
I like shooting an M16A2 service rifle, but you know, as a gamer and as a regular person,

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:59.000
you don't need a fucking rifle in your house.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:04.000
I understand you want to protect, a 9mm is fine, your fists, whatever,

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:10.000
but you don't need a motherfucking air rifle in your house. You don't need it.

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:15.000
There is absolutely no reason for it.

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:16.000
Done.

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:22.000
I personally agree, but unfortunately you and I right now aren't the ones changing the laws,

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:27.000
but all we can do is yell and scream until the people we think that would accurately represent our positions

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
are the ones in office. That's all we can really do.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Alright Rama, I really gotta let you go.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
We fight the good fight, okay.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
Alright, take care my friend. Take care.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Alright, bye.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Alright, and with that I am going to close up the Skype line tonight.

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:43.000
Thank you so much for the calls. I really appreciate it.

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:47.000
That was a really heavy end to Orange Lounge Radio tonight, but it was good.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Loki, you weren't saying much, but hopefully you found it good.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:51.000
Yeah, it was interesting.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:54.000
Yeah, right? Anything you want to add or say?

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:57.000
No.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:02.000
I don't know, I can't really think of many instances where video games have kind of saved my life.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Well, everybody brings different perspectives to it, but there's something that keeps you with them, right?

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:12.000
Why do you keep going back to video games?

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:17.000
Because it's fun. It's entertaining. I have other things I entertain myself with.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:22.000
There's really nothing wrong with that answer either. There's really nothing wrong with that answer.

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:29.000
I think for Rama, sometimes video games were fun because the outside wasn't a lot of fun.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:37.000
And maybe for Act Deaf, it was a similar thing where video games were the fun thing you do because there's not a lot of fun news in the community sometimes.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:51.000
And for me, it was like I like to play video games because it was something I could talk to other kids about and not get teased for being overtly homosexual or whatever you want to call it.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:56.000
There's lots of things that I find fun and entertaining. This is one of those things.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:02.000
And I like Rocky, as I just talked about. We all got our other things. So, yeah, I get it. I get it.

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:05.000
And if we had a Qsar nearby, I'd be doing a podcast with our Qsar.

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:06.000
There you go. There you go.

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:24.000
We don't, so, ugh. I saw, like, we literally drove by the Fair Oaks laser tag place, which used to be Laser Force, which was our stiff, that was like, no, they were the enemy, laser force, yay, Qsar.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:25.000
Now they're the only ones still in town.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Well, they're in town and same with Laser Quest, which is the one at Golf Land. I hate both. I haven't actually played Laser Force, so I can't knock it.

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:38.000
And they have Laser X near us too, but Qsar, man, that was the one that I played and I got hooked on.

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:45.000
And sadly, all those centers are the nearest ones in Vacaville, which is like a 45 minute drive away.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:49.000
And it's not maintained well either.

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:57.000
All right. Well, anyhow, we are going to end Orange John's Radio on that note tonight. Thank you guys so much for the calls and I really appreciate it.

02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:03.000
You know, yeah, we went, we went a little deep tonight, but sometimes that's just the way life's going to go.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:08.000
You know, that's how we, that's how we get through some of these difficult weeks together, sharing stories.

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:11.000
So thank you guys as always for listening to the show.

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:14.000
As I do always say, if you enjoyed the show, help us spread the word.

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:17.000
A nice five star review on iTunes goes a really, really long way.

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:23.000
As does word of mouth. Tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:26.000
As long as the voices are here to put out there.

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:30.000
And who knows, maybe after our discussion tonight, there's going to be some more people that want to speak up.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:34.000
So I encourage you to. Let's have a civil discussion.

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:37.000
Participate at orangejohnsradio.com.

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:41.000
We read, we read the tweets, even if we don't always respond to everyone on air.

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:46.000
But at OLR on Twitter, as well as Facebook, facebook.com slash orangejohnsradio.

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
But that is it. We're going to be back in seven days.

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:51.000
Jamie will be back. She missed a heck of an episode tonight.

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
I'm sure she would have had a lot to say.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
So we'll just have to check in with her next week.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:58.000
But I hope you're feeling better if you're out there, Jamie.

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:03.000
And we'll see her in seven days. We'll see you guys in seven days before we roll the credits.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Let's get everybody's final thought.

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
Loki, I'll start with you. Your final thought tonight.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:10.000
My final thought is, I guess off the plate.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:15.000
Well, I am going to play some more video games this week because Burnout Paradise Remastered is coming out.

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:18.000
I am going to buy that. I definitely want to get back into that.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:21.000
I do need that. I do need the work on my game.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
It's kind of like, I don't know.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:28.000
I got to restart if I was going to do It's Time the Car, which I don't even know if I'm going to do that anymore.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:31.000
I'd have to restart it completely anyways.

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:34.000
And so it's just kind of finding a project that I really want to work on.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:41.000
The project I really want to work on is so fucking huge in scope that I can't work on it.

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:46.000
So that's the only bummer with that, but I have to find something new.

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:51.000
I know you're so against this idea, but even I have to echo Bobby Blackwolf and say,

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Just do something. I know.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:57.000
Start with a Pong clone. Start with, just do something.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:02.000
Start with a clone. Do something. Finish a product. Feel good about it. Then tackle the bigger stuff.

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:06.000
But that's the problem. I don't feel good about something like that.

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
How would you know when you don't finish anything?

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:12.000
I know because, fine. I will do something.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:15.000
Yeah, thank you. Act F says, Pong with cars. There you go.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:24.000
Pong with cars, no. Okay, but I have ideas. It's just the problem is they're too grandiose.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:31.000
Do what the Titan team did at Blizzard and dial it back to its strongest concept, which was Overwatch.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
Yeah, well.

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Alright, I'm trying. I'm trying. Alright. That's a long final thought.

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:44.000
My final thought is, I had the Marshmallow Peeps Oreos this week, and they're actually really good.

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:49.000
I don't care how y'all feel about Peeps. There's no Marshmallow in the cookie, so if you're like,

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:52.000
Ehh, Marshmallow. It's not in the cookie. It just tastes like Peeps.

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:55.000
And I liked them. Sorry if you didn't.

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:58.000
Have a good night, everybody. We'll see you in seven days. Bye.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:02.000
