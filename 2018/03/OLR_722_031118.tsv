14000	21000	This week, the gaming industry once relied on console and feature exclusivity, but more and more staples are opening their doors to competitors in order to reach a wider audience.
21000	27000	With obvious pros, this change can also bring cons. We'll tell you about this and more, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	38000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.
38000	44000	Tonight, episode number 722 for this, March the 11th of 2018.
44000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you in studio to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
50000	54000	And typically, I would be joined by the one and only Jamie Summers, or DarkSakura.
54000	60000	However, she is not here tonight. She got pretty sick after a day trip yesterday, so I hope she is feeling better.
60000	65000	I understand she was kind of up all night and not feeling so great, so I did check in with her about an hour ago over texting.
65000	71000	And she's already feeling a lot better, but because she didn't sleep at all last night, she thought she would sit the night out.
71000	74000	So it's just myself here and Techmaster Loki.
74000	75000	Who needs sleep?
75000	78000	Who needs sleep? You mentioned before you haven't been getting much sleep either.
78000	79000	No.
79000	86000	But she's had some medical stuff a couple months ago, so I think it's a little different for her than it is for you or me.
86000	92000	Me, I'm just dealing with the whole Daylight Savings Time thing, which to our live folks, depending on where you live,
92000	97000	if you're in Arizona, Hawaii, or maybe another country, we might have shifted our time, our lifetime a little bit,
97000	101000	because we had Daylight Savings just happen here, which means it was spring forward.
101000	105000	It was the anti-share, because usually you get to share that meme that says,
105000	109000	If I could turn back time, or don't forget to turn back time, or whatever that thing is, right?
109000	111000	That meme that's out there.
111000	118000	But this is the one where it's actually, you can't, it's not turning back time, it's springing forward time.
118000	120000	So the share meme doesn't work so well.
120000	122000	But that also means everybody loses an hour of sleep.
122000	126000	But I'm actually okay with it, even though I'm a little bit like, oh, I'm disoriented.
126000	129000	I'm like, wow, it's daylight, we're just starting OLR.
129000	135000	I'm a little disoriented with all of that. It's still, I really love that it stays lighter longer at night.
135000	138000	I also love that the sun's not in my eyes on the way to work.
138000	140000	Yeah, that's also a nice benefit as well, right?
140000	141000	Yeah.
141000	145000	And, you know, it's really good, especially because you all know, we do a lot of location-based gaming.
145000	150000	You know, we've talked about, you know, Pokemon Go, and Ingress, and some of those other location-based games.
150000	153000	We'll probably play Harry Potter, and all the new ones too.
153000	156000	Hell, I'll even try that Ghostbusters thing we talked about a couple weeks ago.
156000	162000	But it's nicer when it's lighter longer, so that there's more time to actually go outside and play some of those games, you know?
162000	165000	You're not, like, creeping around in a park when it's already dark.
165000	168000	So, yeah, I'm all for daylight savings.
168000	171000	I wish they would just keep it this way all the time.
171000	174000	But I know they don't want to do that for whatever reason.
174000	175000	Farmers.
175000	177000	That's right. Darn those farmers.
177000	179000	And think of the children farmers.
179000	191000	All right. Well, anyhow, we want to go to our chatters because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show over at The Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
191000	197000	And, by the way, speaking of vognetwork.com, our lovely home of the past, oh, gosh, been at least five years.
197000	199000	We've been here at vognetwork.com.
199000	207000	Did you know, Loki, that this very broadcast we're doing right now is the 1000th live broadcast at vognetwork.com?
207000	220000	If you take every live, every live Bobby show, every live anime jam session, understation live, and any, like, special thing that showed up in there, like, when we did indie arcade and stuff, this would be the 1000th broadcast at vognetwork.com that's live.
220000	222000	So, cool.
222000	223000	Yeah.
223000	229000	Yay. I don't know how we commemorate that, but if I had a drink in front of my hand, I would take a sip right now.
229000	231000	There you go. Here's to you, vognetwork.
231000	238000	And here's to you our chatters at live.vognetwork.com, where SSG100Matt says, Farmers don't even use it anymore.
238000	244000	It just annoys everybody. It's just something we haven't taken out. We just haven't, I don't know, gotten rid of it.
244000	251000	Bobby Black Wolf says, Florida just passed a law petitioning US Congress to make it Daylight Savings Time all the time in Florida.
251000	256000	Yeah, I heard that that, you know, in order to get rid of Daylight Savings, I guess this is what they'd have to do.
256000	263000	But this is the right, it's the first time in a very long time I'm saying, Florida's doing it the right way.
263000	266000	Because we want it to be Daylight Savings all the time.
266000	271000	Just someone tell Trump that Obama loves Daylight Savings and then he'll get rid of it.
271000	277000	Or that he made that a thing. He'll get rid of it. It's reverse psychology.
277000	279000	It's something that was passed under Obama.
279000	284000	Yeah, Obama did that. I mean, he doesn't know anything. I mean, he's like, oh crap, we gotta get rid of that.
284000	291000	No, I got it. I got it. Bobby says, no, no, no, we want to get rid of Standard Time. We like Daylight Savings.
291000	292000	Oh, okay.
292000	293000	We'll work that out.
293000	301000	Well, let's say the Standard Time is like the metric system. And of course, we'll just try to stay away from that because, you know, the metric system made sense and we have to do things our way.
301000	303000	We'll figure out a way to get the message across.
304000	307000	Let's see, also going to our chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com.
307000	312000	RageNator wants to know, what bacon-fied food did Loki bring to the studio tonight?
312000	318000	I'm dieting, believe it or not. I've been dieting for like a few weeks now, so I didn't bring bacon-fied food.
318000	328000	I've been very good. I have like, say, because I have my fitness guru or whatever the hell that stupid app is that you track your calories in.
328000	332000	So, I've been doing that for at least three or four weeks now.
332000	333000	Good for you.
333000	340000	And down like 10 pounds. So, no, I have a Subway sandwich just because I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat and I know what the calories are of that.
340000	349000	Yeah, as far as fast food goes, like, Subway is really one of your best choices if you cut out, you know, mayonnaise and the beef that has a lot.
349000	357000	I do mayonnaise, but I do the light mayo there because it does save 100 calories. And then I don't really get a ton of stuff on it. It's high in sodium, so that's the only bad thing.
357000	365000	But I was just like, I don't know what I want. Like, I was sitting there like even two hours before I left. I'm like, what the hell am I going to have for dinner?
365000	375000	And it's like, okay, well, I can have tacos or I can have Subway. Those are my options. I was like, well, I don't really want tacos today.
375000	382000	It's interesting you talk about the 10-pound landmark because I actually, I also passed, I've been dieting a little longer than you, but I just passed the 10-pound landmark myself.
382000	390000	My diet's been all about like portion control. Like I've just, I've really been bad about snacking about like, you know, I would sit here during the show with like a bowl of chips and all that stuff.
390000	399000	And I've really kind of cut back on a lot of that. So, um, I've lost 10 pounds doing that, but y'all, Friday at a really bad cheat day.
399000	408000	I had a really bad cheat day Friday. Not only did I make it my one day during the week that I went out to lunch at work and I got Taco Bell and I ate all right at Taco Bell.
408000	416000	Like I didn't eat crazy. Like I just got like a chicken burrito with no sauce. You know, again, it's a lot of times I don't want to rob myself of the stuff I like.
416000	427000	If I'm craving Taco Bell, I'm going to go to fucking Taco Bell. But instead of ordering, you know, steak quesadillas slobbered in sauce and all this stuff, we'll get like, you know, a chicken burrito with no sauce.
427000	428000	You know, I'll try to cut corners where I can.
428000	431000	Yeah, I've just been cutting out soda except for the Red Bulls.
431000	432000	Oh yeah, no soda, no soda.
432000	440000	Yeah, it's mainly no soda. Just, you know, I'll have like a Red Bull almost each day. Not really. It's usually been like the smaller ones.
440000	447000	I got a larger one today cause like I was telling Rob, I've been up to one in the morning for like the whole week and you know, with daylight savings, I'm like kind of tired.
448000	457000	And I've been with my kids for the whole weekend going to multiple birthday parties. So I'm beat. I need caffeine to wake up.
457000	468000	But normally I've been pretty good about it. And like instead of snacking on pretzels and stuff, I've been eating like protein bars and you know, healthier choices if possible.
468000	477000	No fast food except for maybe, you know, occasionally I'll go to Rubio's because they've got, you know, their fish tacos are actually not so bad for you.
477000	478000	Make good choices.
478000	480000	Yes. And DDR.
480000	497000	Well, I mean, I didn't finish my story. I made bad choices on Friday, but this does tie to gaming because some of my Ingress buddies, including some of the people you heard here on the show, you know, back in January, wanted to get together because, you know, sometimes like the group in Ingress, like we all generally, I think anyway, we all kind of like each other, you know.
497000	509000	And, you know, I've made friends through that game and so forth. So some folks suggested, hey, there's a food truck festival over at the park in East Sacramento. Let's go to the food truck festival and then we'll, you know, eat some food.
509000	514000	And then we'll, there's a ton of portals right there because it's a park and then we'll do like a farm and it'll be like a night thing.
514000	523000	So, so we did. I went to the food truck festival. Oh my God, I bad because they have Buckhorn barbecue and I have a big weakness for their tri-tip. It's really good.
523000	534000	So I ate that and then it was like, well, I got to see what these local food trucks have and it was ice cream. Loki, I got like this big old waffle cone with ice cream and it was peppermint sauce and crushed Andes mints.
534000	546000	It was so flippin' good. But needless to say, when it came to my weigh in today, I'd gained two of my two pounds back that I'd lost midweek.
546000	555000	So whoops, I had a little bit of a setback, but you know, that's all right. I'll make better choices moving forward. And the important part is I had a really good time Friday night.
555000	562000	So, you know, cause then after we farmed, it was like some of us splintered off. We're like, let's go smash all the blue on the grid cause we're right here. Let's go. So, you know, we had a good time.
562000	566000	So, um, but yeah, it was, it wasn't my best diet choices.
567000	576000	Well, yeah. And I am going to get into the bacon stuff at some point. I do want to get back on, like, cause I wanted to go on like the keto diet, but that requires me to do a lot of food planning.
576000	583000	Like right now it's kind of like on a whim, like here's what I've got, you know, and what do I want for lunch? I don't know, you know, let's pick something.
583000	593000	Um, you know, so like basically breakfast has always been like a yogurt and like, um, like a granola bar or something like that.
593000	602000	And then lunch is usually whatever's nearby. So I'll do either like a six inch sub at Subway, you know, that's like only 300 calories or something.
602000	610000	And then, or like a talk, a couple tacos from Rubio's, which actually aren't that many calories. So I get those.
610000	617000	Um, and then dinner, usually I will skip dinner or like just have something very light. So I don't feel like I'm going to pass out.
617000	625000	But I've been like even under like, cause I have my goal in the app to lose a pound a week, but I've been way under that on calorie wise.
625000	631000	Uh, so anyway, it didn't mean to make this a diet show, but it's just something I think we're all kind of going through right now here at OLR.
631000	638000	And, uh, you know, it does kind of tie to gaming. Cause if you're, if you're playing a lot of video games, you're kind of looking at yourself going, I got, I got a little bigger.
638000	644000	Exactly. Yeah, I have to do, you know, again, I'm not a doctor disclaimer, but just try making better choices.
644000	655000	Like don't take the bag of Doritos with you to the couch when you play a video game or watch Netflix instead, you know, leave it in the kitchen or take some carrots or celery.
655000	664000	Even though I know that sounds super lame, but you don't even like, even if you don't want to do the dieting stuff, like just at least track your calories and be honest with what you're eating.
664000	672000	Yeah. And just see how much like you're, you'll be like, Holy crap. You know, like just make a little adjustments. You don't have to like sometimes when people diet and maybe, and that's what works for some people.
672000	680000	Again, I'm not here to tell you what works for you, but, but I know for me, like I can't do this radical fucking shift where it's like, I'm going to go on Atkins.
680000	691000	I'm just picking on salad every day. Yeah, no, that's not going to work for me. I can't do a radical change, but I can go, Hmm, where could I make some improvements?
691000	698000	What like little things could I adjust? Maybe something this week and something next week that would help and, and so far knock on wood. So good. So good.
698000	710000	Yeah. So like I started, like I started with, I was still going fast food, but I was, instead of getting a large, I get like, you know, the regular size and like get, you know, a smaller soda and start with that.
710000	718000	Or, you know, then I got it without soda and I stopped going the fast food and I, you know, just cut down the calories and cut down what I'm eating.
718000	727000	And then eventually it's just like, okay, I want to do diet and exercise. So it was just mainly portion control and now tracking calories, you know, watching how much everything costs.
727000	737000	It's like, you know, I don't have enough to go there. Like if I went, like we went to birthday parties this week, so I was like, okay, I can only have one slice of pizza instead of I'm going to eat as much pizza as I can.
737000	746000	You know, I'm going to drink tons of soda. It was like, okay, I can't really afford to eat that slice of pizza. I'll just eat this one and no soda.
746000	749000	Pizza at those places sucks anyway.
749000	756000	Yes, I've had pizza at Chuck E. Cheese and pizza at some other like place and it's not, it's not terrible.
756000	760000	All right, let's, let's wrap up this topic. I do want to just quickly say that to tie it back to gaming.
760000	766000	Dar Tetsuya says, I can't speak for my diet, but I did start playing DDR semi-regularly again. There you go. Exercise gaming.
766000	767000	Exactly.
767000	770000	There you go. And that's a DDR with your machine has been a big part of what you're doing too, right?
770000	772000	Exactly. I've been playing lots of DDR.
772000	774000	That's what I need. I need a DDR machine.
774000	780000	Alan, you out there? I need a DDR machine. All right, let's get into gaming news.
780000	782000	Kickoff topic tonight before we get to our gaming weeks.
782000	788000	Look, I know everybody out there probably already heard about this, the Nintendo Direct that happened this week.
788000	790000	And let's just, let's just skip to it.
790000	796000	Look, I know people that seek out gaming podcasts, you probably have some awareness of what's going on in gaming already.
796000	801000	If somehow you've missed it, if you're not on social media, somehow you've missed it.
801000	808000	By the way, Nintendo dropped a little bit of a bombshell at the end of their Direct that they confirmed Super Smash Brothers for the Nintendo Switch.
808000	812000	It's happening and it's happening in 2018 per the trailer.
812000	815000	And a pretty clever little reveal they did.
815000	822000	You know, they made it look like a Splatoon trailer at the beginning, which was funny because it came right on the heels of a bunch of Splatoon announcements.
822000	829000	So for me personally, I was like, oh, this is Smash because we've already seen all the Splatoon announcements and they hyped this up as one more thing.
829000	836000	But I bet there were a lot of people that were thinking, you know, somebody in chat I saw said, oh, maybe it was a Splatoon port for 3DS or something.
836000	837000	Was it the one more thing?
837000	843000	But anyway, of course, in and up, so you have like 30 seconds of the Inkling kids shooting each other.
843000	848000	Then all of a sudden the lights go out, you know, and then it's like this, the sun is rising and it's a big flame sun.
848000	851000	It's very intimidating. It's very scary for a Nintendo game.
851000	855000	And the reflection of the fire sun is in the Inkling girl's eyes.
855000	862000	And sure enough, it's the Smash Brothers logo and then a hint of Shadow Mario, a hint of Breath of the Wild Link,
862000	869000	and then a hint of like 20 other silhouettes that YouTubers have analyzed to death about who is in the game already.
869000	874000	But there you go, Smash Brothers confirmed for 2018, assuming they don't push it back.
874000	881000	But I'm assuming Nintendo must be pretty confident that they're going to make 2018 or they wouldn't have announced it right now.
881000	884000	So, Logi, Smash Brothers, what'd you think?
885000	889000	I don't really play much Smash Brothers. I haven't really played much of my Wii, to be honest.
889000	890000	Really?
890000	899000	My son's really monopolized that, but I mean, I like Smash Brothers and the Wii, but I don't play it like, you know, religiously.
899000	906000	With even like a lot of fighting games, it's more of like, you have to be good in order to be able to play this online, you know, that type of thing.
906000	907000	I think Smash is a fun party game to have.
907000	908000	It is.
908000	912000	I like to just have it on hand for when I have people, even though I rarely have people over anymore these days,
912000	917000	but when I do have people over, like Smash is one of those things I like to have, you know, it's a great party game.
917000	922000	And it's really easy to kind of pick up and play, too, especially, you know, support so many different types of controllers.
922000	928000	And I'm assuming with the Switch, you know, every Switch has two controllers by default, right?
928000	935000	So I'm assuming you'll be able to play either with both of them in the dog years, or you'll be able to, you know, pop them out and just play with the controller by itself.
935000	936000	I'm sure it'll work fine.
936000	938000	How are we going to plug in GameCube controllers?
939000	942000	I thought they were already working on something like that for the Switch.
942000	949000	I thought we already saw some type of GameCube adapter thing for the Switch, and that was the big clue that Nintendo was working on a Smash Bros. for Switch.
949000	952000	Of course they were working on a Smash Bros. for Switch. Of course they were going to do it.
952000	954000	The big question was...
954000	959000	Well, I was going to say, going back to Splatoon, I'm surprised they don't have guest characters in Splatoon.
959000	965000	Like, playing as, like, Mario from Mario Sunshine or something like that, or, you know...
965000	967000	Wait. Anything is possible.
967000	971000	But the Splatoon kids do seem to be the brand new characters in everything, right?
971000	974000	Because they were the big new reveal in Mario Kart 8.
974000	975000	I can see it now. They can...
975000	982000	Their ability, they're going to have a unique ability where they can spring ink on the ground and turn into a squid and go really fast and dive through there.
982000	984000	That's going to be the next fucking E3 thing.
984000	987000	Why not? No, they'll announce more characters at E3.
987000	989000	They're going to start to confirm some of the...
989000	993000	Because now we know that Smash is happening ahead of E3.
994000	998000	Smash is going to be that Nintendo line that is fucking insane at the booth.
998000	1001000	Especially with the public being able to get into E3 now.
1001000	1005000	Like, if you needed a reason to go to E3 as the public, here you go.
1005000	1008000	And they're going to have, like, a Smash Invitational with the new game.
1008000	1012000	Have fun in that five hour line, waiting to play Smash Bros. being one of the first.
1012000	1014000	But that's where you're going to get your big reveal.
1014000	1016000	Get in line at Best Buy.
1016000	1022000	Maybe. You're right. Maybe if we're lucky, we would see something where the local stores will have a type of demo.
1022000	1025000	We don't know. It's a little too far out to be able to say.
1026000	1031000	Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf says,
1031000	1035000	Smash is their holiday 2018 tent pole. Yep, looks like it at this point.
1035000	1039000	Tigerclaw says, I wouldn't be surprised if Shovel Knight, our characters in the new Smash Bros.,
1039000	1041000	they have an amiibo, so it's a given.
1041000	1047000	Well, you know who else is getting an amiibo, based on what we saw in the Nintendo Direct, is Dark Souls Dude.
1047000	1049000	Right? Is getting a Praise the Sun amiibo.
1049000	1055000	I would love that stuff in there. They have another Smash-like game that has, I forget what it's called,
1055000	1058000	but they have one that has some of these guest characters in there.
1058000	1062000	There was actually a Kickstarter, I think, that had a bunch of these indie games.
1062000	1067000	They had the guy from VVV, they had, I think, Shovel Knight was in there,
1067000	1070000	and a bunch of the other guys from a bunch of these other games.
1070000	1077000	And the Switch has been really heavy on indie stuff, so honestly, the time has never been better for Shovel Knight or Shantae.
1077000	1079000	You know, I know there's been a lot of fan cams.
1079000	1083000	The time has never been better for those guys to show up in Smash Bros.
1083000	1087000	So here's the question a lot of people are asking, and I know some of you believe you have the-
1087000	1088000	Or what about Dylan?
1088000	1093000	Hold on. I know some of you believe you have the definitive answer to this based on tweets and so forth,
1093000	1099000	but a lot of people are asking, port or new game? Is it a port or is it a new game?
1099000	1106000	People are suggesting that it's a new game because the logo is slightly different than the one that they had for the Wii U and 3DS.
1106000	1110000	I believe it's a new game, and it's nothing to do with that.
1110000	1119000	I think it's just- I think what it is, it's not going to be necessarily a radical reinvention of the last game, if that makes sense.
1119000	1124000	Like, I think it's going to be very similar to what we saw between Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 1.
1124000	1132000	Like, Splatoon 2, it's great. I mean, I'm not- it's just- it took a lot of what worked in Splatoon 1 and just kind of refined it and made it better.
1132000	1138000	And I have a really good, strong feeling that that's where we're at with this new Smash Brothers game, whatever it is.
1138000	1143000	It's not necessarily going to be a port, but it's just going to be, you know, they're going to take the formula,
1143000	1147000	and it's going to be very similar, I think, in some ways. I think you'll see a lot of returning stuff.
1147000	1153000	For example, I don't see any reason why they need to cut a single character out of the game.
1153000	1158000	Save for maybe some of the third-party stuff, because, you know, I know y'all might think,
1158000	1162000	oh, it's easy because Namco works on the game to get Pac-Man back in the game and all that stuff.
1162000	1163000	You know, I-
1163000	1164000	Nobody cares about Pac-Man.
1164000	1169000	Well, I like playing Pac-Man. Fuck you. I like Championship Edition on Switch right now, too. I was playing that this week.
1169000	1171000	So fuck you. Fuck you two times.
1171000	1174000	But anyway, I would like for Pac-Man to come back.
1174000	1182000	But, I mean, I don't think any third-party character is ever a given, but I don't see any reason why all the first-party things won't come right back.
1182000	1185000	Save for maybe some Pokemon swaps.
1185000	1189000	You know, maybe instead of having some dedicated Pokemon characters.
1189000	1192000	I think you'll have Pikachu and Jigglypuff. Like, those are the two musts.
1192000	1198000	But then everything else, you know, you might see them switch something out for something new. We'll see.
1198000	1203000	But I don't see any reason why they'd cut anything. In fact, I would hope they're going to bring Ice Climbers back.
1203000	1210000	Because now the reason why Ice Climbers didn't happen in the Wii U was because of the 3DS version,
1210000	1216000	where they were worried about having, like, eight players, this Ice Climber, all at once. It was too much on the system of drain.
1216000	1220000	That shouldn't be a problem with the Switch. So I hope Ice Climbers is back.
1220000	1223000	Shouldn't have been a problem on the 3DS either, but whatever.
1223000	1230000	But anyway, I'm sure Character Wank is going to make up so many blogs and tweets and other podcasts you listen to.
1230000	1232000	Like, I don't know what else we could add to that.
1232000	1238000	Fine. A tiny little bit of Character Wank. What character would you want to see in the game, Loki?
1238000	1240000	Reasonably. Realistically.
1240000	1246000	Realistically? Like, I've always been saying it. I can't just pick one.
1246000	1252000	Okay, so obscure character that I would like to see in the game, just because the game never came out over here.
1252000	1256000	And I feel that it would have been a great game, because it was just so strange.
1256000	1261000	It featured a bunch of non-focused on characters.
1261000	1264000	Like, Captain Rainbow should be in the game.
1264000	1269000	But even they have other characters from the Mario games that they just completely forget about nowadays.
1269000	1272000	Like, Birdo. Put Birdo in the fucking game or something.
1272000	1275000	You just named the character that I was going to say. Birdo.
1275000	1279000	That's fine. I want to see some Super Mario Brothers 2 love.
1279000	1282000	Birdo or Wart, I would like to see.
1282000	1283000	Wart would be good, yeah.
1283000	1287000	Wart has been gone forever. What has Wart done?
1287000	1290000	They somehow actually killed Wart.
1290000	1294000	They can't seem to make Bowser or any of his children disappear ever.
1294000	1297000	But they somehow killed Wart.
1297000	1301000	So Mario Brothers 2 love would be on my list.
1301000	1303000	Or Geno.
1303000	1311000	Or we could go really obscure and name some of the stuff from Super Mario Land.
1311000	1315000	The Game Boy one that was way different than most Mario games.
1316000	1321000	So mine is Birdo. Yours is?
1321000	1323000	I would say probably Captain Rainbow.
1323000	1325000	Because it's just a weird character.
1325000	1327000	I would also take Tingle.
1327000	1332000	I think Tingle was an assist, but I would accept Tingle as a full character.
1332000	1341000	I think though, if we're getting Breath of the Wild Link, how do we not get Linkle?
1341000	1344000	With how popular Linkle has been in the fan community and stuff.
1344000	1348000	How do we not get Linkle in the next Smash Brothers?
1348000	1350000	I kind of think that's a given.
1350000	1352000	I do like a lot of the gender swap stuff, so they may do that.
1352000	1353000	Yeah, why not?
1353000	1355000	They did with the fire emblem.
1355000	1359000	No offense to the fire emblem, but there's way too many fire emblem characters.
1359000	1361000	I'm totally fine if they cut some of the fire emblem characters.
1361000	1363000	Sorry guys.
1363000	1365000	I think if they do cut things.
1365000	1370000	Or if they can do one character that's color swaps or something like that.
1370000	1372000	The color swaps are different characters.
1372000	1375000	I would say the other thing that might be in danger are the Miis.
1375000	1377000	And that whole thing.
1377000	1379000	Because I kind of feel like the emphasis on Switch.
1379000	1383000	I know they still exist, but I kind of feel like the emphasis has been taken away from that a little bit.
1383000	1387000	So I wouldn't be surprised if the Miis get retired.
1387000	1389000	But we'll see. Anything's possible.
1389000	1392000	There's really no reason to cut anything, but we'll see.
1392000	1394000	We'll see what happens.
1394000	1396000	I don't want to spend too much time on Smash Brothers Wank.
1396000	1398000	But it's everywhere this week.
1398000	1400000	People are really excited about this game.
1400000	1403000	It brings a lot of the best in Nintendo under one roof.
1403000	1405000	It's really easy for anybody to pick up.
1405000	1407000	This is why people are excited about it.
1407000	1409000	And these games do sell really well.
1409000	1413000	I would hope though that we do see some indie support.
1413000	1418000	I do. Because I think the Switch owes a lot of its early success to the indies.
1418000	1422000	I would love to see a Rocket League car as an assist.
1422000	1424000	Obviously they can't be a character.
1424000	1426000	But a Rocket League car as an assist I think would be pretty rad.
1427000	1429000	And some of the other stuff we name.
1429000	1431000	Like Shovel Knight, Shantae.
1431000	1434000	That would be really crazy as a crossover character.
1434000	1439000	Like Steve from Minecraft as a playable character.
1439000	1441000	That would be pretty badass if they pull it off.
1441000	1443000	I don't think they would do it.
1443000	1445000	I don't know. Microsoft ain't stupid.
1445000	1449000	They know how big Smash Brothers is.
1449000	1454000	And they don't really see themselves competing with the Switch I don't think.
1454000	1456000	I would just be cool.
1456000	1458000	Yeah Minecraft Steve is a character.
1458000	1460000	That would be huge if that was announced.
1460000	1462000	But I don't know.
1462000	1465000	That's not on the plausibility scale.
1465000	1467000	That's a little lower.
1467000	1469000	Right. Exactly.
1469000	1471000	Alright. Anyway. What else?
1471000	1473000	What else, Loki? What else on the Nintendo Direct?
1473000	1475000	Because there's other stuff too.
1475000	1477000	They started off with a lot of 3DS news.
1477000	1482000	Of course they have a new Dylan game coming out.
1483000	1485000	Dylan's Dead Heat Breakers.
1485000	1487000	And if you don't remember who Dylan was.
1487000	1490000	Dylan was like this Armandillo type game.
1490000	1495000	Which I don't understand why he's not a character in Smash Brothers.
1495000	1497000	Whatever.
1497000	1499000	So that's scheduled to be coming out.
1499000	1502000	They're remaking Luigi's Mansion for the 3DS.
1502000	1506000	In other news that nobody asked for.
1506000	1508000	Why?
1509000	1512000	Okay. Here's the thing. I'm not trying to hit on the 3DS.
1512000	1515000	But I really feel like the 3DS has run its course.
1515000	1518000	I get that there's still the loyalists out there for the 3DS.
1518000	1521000	You paid good money for it. I understand.
1521000	1523000	There's a very rich library on 3DS.
1523000	1526000	But, y'all. Pokemon has moved off the 3DS.
1526000	1528000	That system's days are numbered.
1528000	1533000	I don't understand why we're continuing to crank out 3DS support through 2019.
1533000	1535000	And here's my thing.
1535000	1538000	If the Switch wasn't also portable, I wouldn't feel so strongly on this.
1538000	1540000	But they're redundant.
1540000	1542000	Those two systems, to me, are now redundant.
1542000	1544000	Because, okay, sure, the 3DS has two screens.
1544000	1546000	Big fucking whoop.
1546000	1550000	You can have good screen real estate on the Switch at this point as well.
1550000	1552000	And the Switch also has a touchscreen.
1552000	1554000	It's portable.
1554000	1557000	But, to be fair, before somebody says,
1557000	1561000	Rob, you're not considering this, I understand that games aren't developed overnight.
1561000	1564000	And Nintendo knew they were taking a risk with the Switch.
1564000	1569000	And so they probably had 3DS games in the pipeline for quite some time.
1569000	1572000	This is where the Metroid game last year fits into, right?
1572000	1574000	Because if the Switch had bombed,
1574000	1577000	Nintendo would have put so much more stock in that Metroid game.
1577000	1579000	I mean, not to say they didn't, but you know what I mean.
1579000	1582000	They would have really been amped in that Metroid game to drive more 3DS sales.
1582000	1584000	Because they would have been really investing themselves in that.
1584000	1586000	And I think you'd see even more on the 3DS right now.
1586000	1589000	But, luckily, the Switch has been a success.
1589000	1592000	So I think with that, it's time to focus on the Switch.
1592000	1595000	And maybe we don't need a port of a fuckin'...
1595000	1598000	What I kinda think is an overrated GameCube game.
1598000	1602000	Sorry, I know Luigi's Mansion has its fans, but...
1602000	1605000	If you're gonna bring something over from the GameCube and the Mario universe,
1605000	1606000	bring Super Mario Sunshine over.
1606000	1608000	But put it on the Switch!
1608000	1611000	Sorry, Rama, but Luigi's second tier.
1611000	1614000	Sorry, Rama, but the year of Luigi, it's over.
1614000	1616000	It's over.
1616000	1620000	Just kidding, but you'll always be my favorite Luigi, Rama, if you're out there somewhere.
1620000	1624000	Luigi doesn't have a holiday each year, like Mario does.
1624000	1626000	And this is the year of Splatoon.
1626000	1628000	What was it? The year of the ink? No.
1628000	1630000	What did they say it was? The year of...
1630000	1633000	They didn't say the year of Splatoon. They said the year of the Octokid.
1633000	1634000	Something like that.
1634000	1637000	Didn't you catch that towards the end? He was doing a little figure eight.
1637000	1639000	Oh, forget it.
1639000	1642000	Yeah, thank you. Act F. The year of the Octolings. That was it.
1642000	1643000	Yeah, they said that.
1643000	1645000	I don't think it's like a...
1645000	1648000	I think it was just more of a tongue-in-cheek comment.
1649000	1651000	And then the F-Zero's over here going,
1651000	1653000	But what about me?
1655000	1658000	You just got a game like a few years ago.
1658000	1660000	It's like, what about me?
1660000	1662000	Captain Falcon will be in Smash.
1662000	1665000	It's a good standby. There'll be an F-Zero stage that'll make us go,
1665000	1668000	Why don't they put the fucking F-Zero on the Switch? God damn it.
1668000	1671000	They'll fucking dropkick those inklings in the face.
1671000	1674000	Or it'll be really funny because what'll happen is that Captain Falcon will be in there,
1674000	1677000	but the stage will be from Fast Racing Remix.
1678000	1680000	And somebody will be like,
1680000	1683000	Oh, I got confused. Sorry, y'all.
1683000	1685000	Sorry about that.
1685000	1689000	They're doing an amiibo for Solera of Astoria,
1689000	1692000	which is from Dark Souls.
1692000	1696000	And Dark Souls Remastered, of course, is coming out May 25th on the Switch.
1697000	1700000	A series that I super didn't really get into,
1700000	1704000	but I know the series has its fans, so interesting.
1704000	1706000	The amiibo thing is really kind of neat,
1706000	1709000	so I guess it really shows that Nintendo wants us to succeed.
1709000	1712000	And since Skyrim did so well,
1712000	1714000	it probably stands to do pretty well.
1714000	1716000	Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker is coming to the Switch,
1716000	1719000	and they're going to have new levels based on Super Mario Odyssey.
1719000	1722000	That's coming out on July 13th,
1722000	1725000	and they're also doing a port to the 3DS as well.
1725000	1727000	This is pretty awesome.
1727000	1732000	South Park, the Fractured But Whole is coming to the Switch in April 24th.
1733000	1736000	Then they announce, of course, the big expansion for Splatoon 2,
1736000	1738000	the Octo expansion.
1738000	1743000	So that'll be coming out for $20 this summer.
1745000	1747000	And let's see what else.
1747000	1751000	Warrior Work Gold, 300 microgames, unfortunately it's on the 3DS.
1751000	1754000	Yeah, I was really excited when I saw that announcement
1754000	1757000	until I remembered it was part of the 3DS sizzle reel.
1757000	1759000	It's a direct response to multitasking.
1759000	1762000	They feel the threat, and so they've got to counter it with, you know,
1762000	1764000	Warrior Work Gold, so...
1764000	1767000	I think Super Multitasking should be on Switch,
1767000	1770000	but I'm sure Eren would like to sleep at some point.
1770000	1774000	But anyway, I think...
1774000	1778000	I'm happy to see that they haven't forgotten WarioWare
1778000	1780000	and that they're still doing a new game.
1780000	1784000	And is it just a best of, or is it like they're actually putting new stuff in it too?
1784000	1787000	Because I got the feeling it's simply a best of,
1787000	1789000	and they're not really doing new stuff for it.
1789000	1792000	But if they do some new stuff, I'll be into it.
1792000	1794000	I mean, again, I wish it was on the Switch,
1794000	1799000	but I also understand that the Switch is missing a few gimmicky things
1799000	1801000	that the 3DS had, like the microphone input and stuff,
1801000	1804000	so there's some things they kind of have to do on 3DS,
1804000	1809000	but I would have let those things go to have a Switch version,
1809000	1811000	but okay, whatever.
1811000	1813000	They had to do what they had to do with the resources they have.
1813000	1816000	I guess it's better than nothing in WarioWare world.
1816000	1820000	They did show that Hyrule Warriors is coming to the Switch in May, May 18th,
1820000	1826000	and then also they're going to be doing a No More Heroes, Travis Strikes Again game.
1826000	1828000	I thought of you when I saw that, because I was like,
1828000	1830000	oh, Loki probably into that.
1830000	1835000	You know, I haven't really been too much into No More Heroes recently,
1835000	1839000	but I hope that's not the new game that they were talking about,
1839000	1841000	like when they were teasing it a while back.
1841000	1845000	I hope this is just like a spinoff game, because it didn't look...
1845000	1848000	It looked all right, I guess, but not what I was hoping for.
1848000	1849000	Okay.
1850000	1855000	Then they have ports, ports, ports, so Kami HD coming to the Switch.
1855000	1859000	They talked about the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy also.
1859000	1860000	That's kind of a big deal, though.
1860000	1863000	The Crash Bandicoot thing, that's kind of a big deal,
1863000	1868000	because I remember, I know not everybody was around in 95, 96
1868000	1871000	when the PlayStation was really starting to take off,
1871000	1876000	but Crash Bandicoot was kind of Sony's mascot for those years for a little bit,
1876000	1880000	and Crash Bandicoot was kind of a real runaway game for the PlayStation,
1880000	1884000	so the fact that it's going over to Switch, that's kind of...
1884000	1886000	And I know we'll talk about it later in the show,
1886000	1889000	but it's not stopping just there with the Switch.
1889000	1893000	It's going to show up other places too, but it's still a little surreal.
1893000	1897000	It's kind of like when the Sonic game first came out on the Switch.
1897000	1898000	That was a little weird.
1898000	1899000	Right, yeah.
1899000	1901000	Or, I mean, on a Nintendo platform, excuse me.
1901000	1903000	That was a little weird.
1903000	1905000	Anyway.
1905000	1910000	And then, of course, more Undertale coming to Switch.
1910000	1914000	They didn't really give a release date just eventually.
1914000	1916000	That's kind of neat, though.
1916000	1918000	Undertale obviously has a huge...
1918000	1921000	I feel like the popularity of that game has kind of dipped down a little bit,
1921000	1925000	but you can't go to a convention and not see somebody make an Undertale reference,
1925000	1928000	so I'm sure people will be excited to check it out on Switch.
1928000	1932000	And then Mario and Luigi's Bowser's Inside Story being remade for the 3DS,
1932000	1934000	as well as Bowser Jr.'s story.
1934000	1936000	That was the one where I really rolled my ass.
1936000	1938000	Coming out for 2019, it's like... still?
1938000	1940000	Yeah, that's a little bit of a wait.
1940000	1943000	On a port, I was a little bit like,
1943000	1946000	this one might have been a little early to talk about,
1946000	1950000	and all it really says is that Nintendo's committed to the 3DS platform through 2019.
1950000	1952000	But why?
1952000	1954000	Some people are going to be really happy to hear that.
1954000	1956000	I'm just ready to see them move on.
1956000	1961000	I hope that that port is one of the last things Nintendo's doing for the 3DS,
1961000	1965000	and that they're putting all their energy and effort over on the Switch at this point.
1965000	1967000	Sounds pretty much it.
1967000	1971000	All right. What did you guys think of the Nintendo Direct?
1971000	1975000	Comment over on our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1975000	1977000	Bobby Black Wolf says,
1977000	1980000	you know the 3DS still has legs and is cheaper than the Switch.
1980000	1982000	How much longer, though?
1982000	1985000	Because we all know it's going to happen,
1985000	1989000	where they're going to put out some type of Switch amped-up version.
1989000	1991000	You know what? I missed out on that whole,
1991000	1994000	they had the thing on eBay for 20% off of everything,
1994000	1997000	so I could have gotten a Switch for like 20% off.
1997000	1999000	I didn't even know that was a thing.
1999000	2001000	I think I saw somewhere, it was like,
2001000	2005000	you get one for like $220 something for a Switch.
2005000	2010000	I was like, oh man, that would have been pretty good, but I don't know.
2011000	2015000	And actdeftinchat says, 3DS still sells a lot, a whole lot.
2015000	2019000	So, I mean, you know, there's still, I guess maybe with kids,
2019000	2022000	you see a lot more 3DS, maybe because the plastic's more durable.
2022000	2025000	I don't know, but I just, I don't know.
2025000	2028000	You know, again, I realize there's more people to game out there than just me,
2028000	2032000	but I just, I'm ready to let 3DS go, come on.
2032000	2034000	They're like competing with themselves there.
2034000	2036000	I mean, you've got a portable system, you're like,
2036000	2039000	well no, don't buy the Switch, buy this cheaper portable system.
2039000	2042000	No, you want to sell the Switch. What's going on?
2042000	2046000	DungeonBuster says this needs more Octopath Traveler.
2046000	2048000	Yeah, that looked all right.
2048000	2051000	You know, I played the demo of Octopath Traveler.
2051000	2053000	I love the art style they're going for with it.
2053000	2057000	So it's nice that we have a date for that because they dated that in June, right?
2057000	2061000	Or it's coming up relatively soon. It's during the summer at some point.
2061000	2065000	And so, and the name is Octopath Traveler.
2065000	2069000	At one point they kind of said, this is the working title.
2069000	2072000	I think that the project Octopath Traveler, but they have confirmed that's it.
2072000	2074000	Man, we need to come up with a new name.
2074000	2075000	Fuck it. I don't know.
2075000	2076000	Just leave it as it is.
2076000	2078000	Yeah, why would you change the name this far along?
2078000	2081000	Now everybody knows that it's this, so, I mean, it's a fine name, so.
2081000	2083000	Just, you know.
2083000	2085000	It's the year of the Octolings.
2085000	2087000	I just leave it to Octopath Traveler.
2087000	2089000	Year of the Octomom.
2089000	2091000	We'll throw in a split.
2091000	2094000	I don't want to travel that path.
2096000	2099000	Go ahead and chat at live.vognetwork.com.
2099000	2105000	RageNator in chat says, I suppose that there's a segment of the gaming community that has the 3DS but no Switch,
2105000	2107000	so further 3DS support is great for them.
2107000	2109000	Maybe they're not in a position to get a Switch.
2109000	2114000	Yeah, but how much longer before the Switch starts coming down in price and getting a little more competitive
2114000	2117000	and we start seeing more used Switches out in the market?
2117000	2122000	Because that, I mean, if Nintendo does start this whole Switch in new colors will be the first thing,
2122000	2128000	and then like an XL Switch or an amped up Switch or a new Switch or whatever it is, right?
2128000	2130000	Because they've done this with the DS things.
2130000	2132000	It's inevitable it's going to happen with Switch at some point.
2132000	2134000	Then the old stuff's going to show up on the used market,
2134000	2138000	and then I think you're going to see a lot more people that are adopting the Switch at that point.
2138000	2141000	Maybe Nintendo is anticipating that in 2019.
2141000	2145000	You know, I doubt they would put out a new Switch this year, but I bet they do something next year.
2145000	2148000	They might do a Switch in a new color this year.
2148000	2155000	That'll be the thing at E3, like a new, a neon green for Splatoon or something, they'll do a Switch.
2155000	2158000	And then next year, oh no no, you know what it'll be?
2158000	2159000	You know what it'll be?
2159000	2162000	A Smash Brothers Switch console.
2163000	2171000	It'll be the Switch controllers set up like the GameCube controller.
2171000	2172000	Remember that old rumor?
2172000	2179000	Remember there was that old rumor about the fact that those detachable controllers could be different types of controllers?
2179000	2186000	You know, we've never seen, I mean, Nintendo's never really discounted that that could ever happen.
2186000	2191000	That would be a very interesting turn of events for Smash specifically,
2191000	2196000	is that all of a sudden you have GameCube style controllers that you can pop in there.
2196000	2197000	That'd be very interesting, wouldn't it?
2197000	2201000	And something Nintendo could sell way over cost.
2202000	2205000	And make a lot of money off of.
2208000	2213000	Alright, let's go ahead and if that's all we have to say about the Nintendo Direct,
2213000	2216000	which obviously I was pretty pleased with the Nintendo Direct.
2216000	2224000	Even without the Smash reveal at the end, I was like, okay, this is about what I would expect for a non-E3 Direct,
2224000	2228000	but now E3, guys, here's the thing though.
2228000	2234000	Everybody says, oh, Smash Brothers must be the tent pole, this must be the big thing for the year.
2234000	2238000	Well, what does that leave Nintendo with for E3?
2238000	2241000	Prime 4?
2241000	2247000	But they've already said they're doing Prime 4, so you think there'll be no surprises at E3?
2247000	2251000	They could show off what their online thing's gonna be, I guess.
2251000	2252000	I guess that could be it.
2253000	2259000	Nintendo could really like, and maybe it's gonna be one of those, y'all, online was worth the wait.
2259000	2262000	I know. Shut up.
2262000	2268000	Yeah, I'm sure it's just gonna be like, I was wrong! I was so wrong!
2268000	2270000	Humor me, bastard.
2270000	2276000	Humor me for a minute here that maybe, you know, online, and the first game they're gonna do online, F-Zero.
2276000	2278000	We'll see. Anyway.
2278000	2281000	Yes, that's what, okay, yeah, sure.
2281000	2285000	Everybody in chat, when I say everybody, Bobby Black Wolf, F-Zero surprise.
2285000	2287000	Act F'd, F-Zero surprise.
2287000	2289000	Dungeon Buster, F-Zero for everyone.
2289000	2293000	Just remove, just, yeah, yeah, here's what, F-Zero surprise, let me fix that for you.
2293000	2296000	F, comma, zero surprise.
2300000	2304000	Alright, look, I wanna mention too, actually, quickly, before we go off the topic of Nintendo Direct,
2304000	2309000	because Akuma JP mentioned that he hasn't watched the Direct, but Akuma JP is in Japan,
2309000	2314000	and Japan gets a different Direct. I mean, some of it overlaps, so they get different stuff.
2314000	2320000	So it is worth mentioning that in Japan, Taiko Drummaster was confirmed as coming to the Switch.
2320000	2322000	Why doesn't that come out over here?
2322000	2328000	Well, the Switch is region-free, so it could. It just won't be in English.
2328000	2331000	But do you need English in a game like Taiko Drummaster? Probably not.
2331000	2333000	Eh, the menus.
2333000	2338000	Also, Saga Scarlet Grace coming out on the Switch over there.
2338000	2342000	But it is also happening on other systems as well.
2342000	2345000	It's not gonna be unique to the Switch, but it's still a pretty big deal that that's happening,
2345000	2347000	the Saga game gonna be happening on the Switch.
2347000	2352000	And then lastly, Phantasy Star Online 2 coming to the Switch in Japan,
2352000	2356000	which I thought we already knew it was coming.
2356000	2361000	I think we got a release date for it in the Direct, and that's April 4th, 2018.
2361000	2367000	It's Phantasy Star Online 2 Cloud, and it does come with stuff from Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild in it.
2367000	2374000	But unfortunately, Sega is continuing to give the U.S. the finger when it comes to Phantasy Star Online,
2374000	2378000	and we're not gonna be seeing it, which kinda sucks.
2378000	2381000	Like, what Phantasy Star Online? I mean...
2381000	2384000	You don't get Phantasy Star Online, you get Sonic Shitty Friends instead.
2384000	2388000	If the Switch is region-free, can I just download Phantasy Star Online,
2388000	2390000	or the server's not gonna let me in because it's gonna go,
2390000	2393000	oh, you're a dumb American, you can't get into Japanese servers.
2393000	2395000	That's what VPNs are for.
2395000	2397000	I guess. I dunno.
2397000	2400000	Alright. Let's see.
2400000	2406000	Act F says, as far as Taiko goes, the PlayStation 4 one has an English option,
2406000	2409000	so maybe they'll do the same for the Switch one.
2409000	2410000	So, hm, there you go.
2410000	2414000	Just release it over here! Why, if you're putting in English in the game,
2414000	2417000	just release the damn thing over here! Why is it such a problem?
2417000	2421000	I dunno. At least digitally. Well, wait, hold on.
2421000	2423000	I'm assuming there's a peripheral that goes with it,
2423000	2425000	so they can't do a digital release.
2425000	2427000	No, you can play the controller.
2427000	2430000	Well, okay, but you can play Beatmania with a controller,
2430000	2433000	but it's not as fun as it is with an actual Beatmania controller.
2433000	2436000	Fine, but like the Switch version, I'm sure it's just motion control.
2436000	2439000	Ah, several folks in chat, including Orangewrite,
2439000	2442000	lighting up with licensing J-pop might be a hassle,
2442000	2444000	so it might be the music license issues,
2444000	2447000	and they don't want to pay to have that out over here.
2448000	2451000	So, Loki looks very irritated.
2451000	2454000	I'm rolling my eyes! My eyes are rolling so much!
2454000	2455000	Whatever.
2455000	2458000	Your logic and facts have shut him down completely.
2458000	2461000	No, it's just, it's dumb. Fine, whatever.
2461000	2464000	We'll pull the Konami Dance Dance Revolution thing.
2464000	2466000	No, you can't bring that over here. Bring it over here.
2466000	2468000	No, you can't do it. Bring it over here.
2468000	2470000	Well, you could. The Switch is region-free, so you could.
2470000	2472000	You're breaking the law!
2472000	2476000	I'm gonna shake my finger at you and look away.
2476000	2478000	Let's get into our gaming week,
2478000	2481000	and we'll start with the guy with a machine
2481000	2484000	that's not supposed to be sold outside Japan in his garage.
2484000	2486000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2486000	2488000	Because it wasn't sold outside of Japan.
2488000	2490000	Well, actually, you know what? Yeah, it was.
2490000	2493000	So, I've been playing Dance Dance Revolution.
2493000	2495000	So, I actually did, I was posting online
2495000	2497000	that I was cleaning my pads and everything,
2497000	2500000	so I finished cleaning the left side,
2500000	2503000	which was the one that was not really working too well,
2503000	2505000	and so now it actually works really well.
2505000	2507000	I was able to almost full combo songs.
2507000	2510000	It's not the pads' fault that I can't full combo the song.
2510000	2512000	It's because I'm out of shape.
2512000	2514000	Well, I'm not as out of shape as I was
2514000	2516000	when I first started playing,
2516000	2519000	but it's definitely a step up from where it was.
2519000	2522000	And then the other thing that was wrong with my machine was
2522000	2524000	it's got an LCD monitor in there,
2524000	2527000	so the picture wasn't quite centered on the screen.
2527000	2529000	It was cut off on the bottom,
2529000	2531000	and I did fix that as well.
2532000	2534000	Now, I probably still need to go back
2534000	2537000	and remod the pads one more time,
2537000	2539000	just because the way I did it this time,
2539000	2541000	I put all the foam on top of the sensors,
2541000	2543000	or the brackets on top of the sensors,
2543000	2545000	and I didn't put any in the corners.
2545000	2547000	It feels a little weird on there
2547000	2549000	because it kind of rocks sometimes
2549000	2552000	if you hit the arrow just the right way.
2552000	2555000	So, I need to kind of put that in the corner
2555000	2556000	so it's more stable,
2556000	2559000	doesn't feel like it's gonna tilt a little bit.
2559000	2560000	It doesn't really affect anything,
2560000	2562000	it's just kind of like, it just feels funny.
2562000	2564000	Then the other thing I noticed too was that
2564000	2567000	apparently I didn't level my stage too well,
2567000	2568000	so I was like,
2568000	2570000	why does it feel like I'm tipping towards the wall?
2570000	2573000	And it's because the feet on that side were too low,
2573000	2575000	so I raised that back on the way.
2575000	2576000	Oh, okay, that's much better.
2576000	2578000	So, it's just been tweaking stuff like that.
2578000	2580000	I'm not even gonna attempt to clean the right side right now
2580000	2583000	because that took like three days to do the last time.
2583000	2585000	Although, that side works really well,
2585000	2590000	so I'm not gonna fix the problem until there is a problem.
2590000	2592000	But yeah, I'm really enjoying it,
2592000	2594000	so I've been keeping up with it,
2594000	2599000	and I've been sticking with non-stops now,
2599000	2601000	so I've been doing tons of non-stops,
2601000	2602000	and then I'll usually play something
2602000	2604000	that I know is way too hard for me
2604000	2605000	till I get my heart rate up,
2605000	2608000	so I'll try to do a kata or something,
2608000	2610000	which I'm not back to that point again
2610000	2611000	where I can do those.
2611000	2616000	Although, I do get through A on Heavy or Oni sometimes,
2616000	2622000	and I full combo'd the Pop 4 non-stop the other day.
2624000	2625000	I'm getting better.
2625000	2626000	It's coming back.
2626000	2630000	It's just been so long.
2630000	2631000	So, I've been playing that,
2631000	2632000	and then it's been mainly mobile games
2632000	2634000	because I've been actually programming during the week.
2634000	2636000	Sadly, not for my game.
2636000	2638000	I will get back to that, I swear.
2638000	2640000	It's just I've been doing work stuff
2640000	2642000	because I've been trying to get a better job,
2642000	2648000	and so I'm going way outside of my job roles
2648000	2653000	in trying to build an extension for Google Chrome,
2653000	2655000	and so I've been doing that.
2655000	2656000	Promotions are good, though.
2656000	2657000	That's more money to buy more games.
2657000	2658000	Right, more money.
2658000	2659000	Yeah, exactly.
2659000	2661000	So, I'm going to get back to that,
2661000	2662000	but I haven't played mobile stuff,
2662000	2664000	so I've been doing Pokemon Go a little bit
2664000	2665000	because I've been in different places
2665000	2667000	with Pokésops nearby,
2667000	2669000	so I've been playing that quite a bit.
2669000	2670000	I have a little bit of Ingress
2670000	2673000	when I'm waiting for Pokésops to recharge again,
2673000	2678000	and a little bit of that Office Space game,
2678000	2680000	but it's really irritating.
2680000	2682000	That's more of like I'm not near Pokéstop.
2682000	2684000	I've already caught a little Pokemon around me.
2684000	2687000	Crap, got to play the Office Space game now.
2687000	2690000	So, that's pretty much it.
2690000	2691000	All right.
2691000	2694000	Let's see, my gaming week.
2694000	2696000	It's really been a lot of the same stuff
2696000	2698000	because I'm still hammering away on Final Fantasy XIV,
2698000	2699000	my big MMO addiction.
2699000	2701000	My Red Mage finally hit 70.
2701000	2703000	That's a class I've really been enjoying playing,
2703000	2705000	so I finally hit 70 on that this week,
2705000	2706000	so that's pretty cool,
2706000	2708000	and it feels nice because you can start buying
2708000	2709000	all the really big gear,
2709000	2712000	and it's like this big jump from level 69 to 70,
2712000	2714000	so that's cool.
2714000	2716000	I've been still playing Heroes of the Storm.
2716000	2717000	In fact, I was playing a little bit of that
2717000	2719000	after OLR last week,
2719000	2720000	and that was a lot of fun,
2720000	2721000	doing some Heroes of the Storm,
2721000	2724000	and I've just been continuing on that game,
2724000	2727000	just trying to level my character slowly.
2727000	2729000	I made sure to get all the stuff from the Lunar Fest,
2729000	2731000	and now I got 10,000 gold.
2731000	2733000	I don't think I bought another character yet with it,
2733000	2735000	so I have to figure out which character I want to get next,
2735000	2737000	so there is that.
2737000	2738000	I need to get back to Overwatch
2738000	2740000	because Alan and I were talking a little bit
2740000	2741000	about Overwatch today,
2741000	2743000	and he reminded me they did some changes to Sombra,
2743000	2745000	and that was one of my favorite characters in the game,
2745000	2747000	but people don't really like it when you play Sombra
2747000	2750000	because I guess people don't see that she's effective,
2750000	2751000	but I really like playing her,
2751000	2753000	so if they've done some changes,
2753000	2755000	I really want to get in there and see what that's all about,
2755000	2759000	and I need to try Brigitte on the test realm as well,
2759000	2760000	the new character.
2760000	2761000	Oh, yeah.
2761000	2762000	Yeah, she looks pretty cool.
2762000	2765000	Isn't she just like Torbjorn?
2765000	2768000	She's like Torbjorn and Reinhardt had a kid.
2768000	2772000	Yeah, except they didn't, but they did.
2772000	2777000	So anyway, yeah, I'm curious to check that out for sure,
2777000	2781000	and then I also played a lot of Pokemon Go yesterday, a lot,
2781000	2784000	because we have the double XP thing going on right now.
2784000	2785000	How long is that going on for?
2785000	2788000	Until the 15th, I think, so it's only a few more days,
2788000	2790000	but it's been a long event, I mean, all things considered,
2790000	2792000	but you know, it was one of those things
2792000	2794000	that was just a perfect storm of events
2794000	2796000	where I didn't really have a lot going on yesterday.
2796000	2799000	I didn't have a lot to do, so Shane and I were talking,
2799000	2801000	and we had talked about going down to the capital
2801000	2803000	maybe to play a lot of Pokemon Go,
2803000	2805000	but then long story short, we were like,
2805000	2806000	why don't we just go to San Francisco?
2806000	2807000	Why don't we just go to Pier 39
2807000	2809000	and get all this stuff that shows up there
2809000	2811000	and just walk and get the stops in the gyms
2811000	2812000	that are in San Francisco?
2812000	2813000	Let's do that.
2813000	2814000	So we did, we went to San Francisco yesterday
2814000	2816000	and walked around for a significant amount of time,
2816000	2818000	and what's really funny is that I ran into Dark Soccer
2818000	2820000	yesterday before she started feeling ill.
2820000	2823000	I ran into her yesterday at Japantown,
2823000	2824000	like totally out of the blue.
2824000	2825000	We didn't plan to meet up.
2825000	2827000	I knew she was gonna be there in the city
2827000	2829000	because there's a big drag queen show going on at the Castro,
2829000	2830000	and you know she goes to those
2830000	2832000	because my buddy JD was there too,
2832000	2834000	and I couldn't meet up with him either
2834000	2836000	because the drag queen's getting in the way,
2836000	2839000	but I didn't have tickets to that show,
2839000	2842000	and it just wasn't on my radar of stuff to do,
2842000	2845000	but it was really funny that we met up anyway
2845000	2849000	with Jamie like unplanned at Japantown,
2849000	2851000	and Shane and I were walking to the arcade there,
2851000	2855000	and Dark Soccer and her friend Becky were walking
2855000	2858000	from one of the stores there, and Jamie with her hair,
2858000	2860000	her hair is like bright pink now.
2860000	2862000	You can't miss her, so I was like,
2862000	2864000	of course, of course I run into you guys here.
2864000	2866000	Of course I do, so it was pretty funny,
2866000	2868000	and I caught a lot of Pokemon
2868000	2871000	and got a lot of stops and gyms in San Francisco,
2871000	2873000	and walked a lot of eggs.
2873000	2876000	I've hatched so many fucking Swablues.
2876000	2877000	I already-
2877000	2878000	I need more of those.
2878000	2879000	400? What the hell do I need-
2879000	2882000	I've already evolved one, and I'm halfway to another.
2882000	2884000	They're just, they're herpes.
2884000	2885000	They're everywhere.
2885000	2887000	They're in every 2K egg right now.
2887000	2889000	I don't think I've hatched a 2K egg yet
2889000	2892000	that didn't have a Swablu in it during this event.
2892000	2893000	Crazy.
2893000	2896000	So, all right, let's see.
2896000	2899000	Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2900000	2902000	Actf says, I need more Swablu too.
2902000	2905000	This event with the bonus to air Pokemon,
2905000	2908000	or whatever it is, is huge on Swablu.
2908000	2910000	There's so many Swablu in 2Ks,
2910000	2911000	and that's good too,
2911000	2913000	because you're more likely to get a Wonder Swablu,
2913000	2917000	so that when you evolve it, you'll have a Wonder.
2917000	2918000	But here's the other thing.
2918000	2920000	They're not very good.
2920000	2922000	They're not worth the four.
2922000	2924000	It's not like a Gyarados.
2924000	2926000	You're gonna spend the 400 candies to evolve it,
2926000	2927000	and then be like, oh.
2927000	2928000	It's like Wailmer.
2928000	2930000	Like, Wailord looks cool,
2930000	2932000	like it's hilarious when you put Wailord in a gym,
2932000	2934000	but Wailord isn't really that great
2934000	2936000	of an attacker or defender,
2936000	2940000	and it's kind of the same thing with Swablu's evolution.
2940000	2943000	So, yeah, that's the bummer about it.
2943000	2945000	But, of course, I know how it is, y'all.
2945000	2947000	You gotta catch them all.
2947000	2949000	It's in the subtitle of the game.
2949000	2950000	You gotta catch them all,
2950000	2952000	and you gotta fill out that Pokedex.
2952000	2955000	Thankfully for Allen, we just went on a raid today,
2955000	2957000	and we actually did two raids today.
2957000	2960000	He finally got his Rayquaza today
2960000	2963000	so he can relax with his Pokedex being full.
2963000	2965000	That was actually a really funny story
2965000	2967000	because we were out doing Ingress stuff today.
2967000	2970000	One of the gals that you heard here a couple months ago,
2970000	2972000	she put together one of those really fun
2972000	2974000	Let's Cover the City events, right?
2974000	2976000	So I went out and did that today,
2976000	2977000	and I was doing my part in that,
2977000	2978000	and then it was about 30 minutes out,
2978000	2979000	and I drove home.
2979000	2981000	And as I'm pulling up the park,
2981000	2986000	I see a gal parked next to what I know as the Pokemon gym,
2986000	2987000	and I look in the car and I'm like,
2987000	2988000	I know her.
2988000	2990000	She's at every raid that happens around here.
2990000	2991000	So I actually rolled out my window.
2991000	2992000	She recognized me. I rolled out my window.
2992000	2993000	I'm like, is there a Pokemon raid going?
2993000	2995000	She's like, yeah, they're all coming over right now.
2995000	2998000	We just did one over at Bleep Bleep Bleep,
2998000	2999000	the other gym that's not far from here,
2999000	3001000	and we're gonna do the one here.
3001000	3002000	And I'm like, cool.
3002000	3004000	So I just parked and walked over to the gym,
3004000	3006000	and I got to do that Pokemon raid.
3006000	3007000	I guess they were doing like,
3007000	3009000	this is a thing now during the double XP
3009000	3012000	because if you pop an egg, you get quadruple XP.
3012000	3015000	So you get 40K from a raid right now.
3015000	3017000	So they did one over yonder.
3017000	3018000	I don't want to say it on air
3018000	3019000	because I don't want to give away where I live,
3019000	3021000	but over like yonder, they did one.
3021000	3022000	They came to the park and they did one.
3022000	3023000	Then they went to the other park.
3023000	3024000	So do you have to get like invited to those?
3024000	3025000	Because I saw one the other day,
3025000	3027000	like I was going to spin,
3027000	3028000	like one of the things is all,
3028000	3031000	sorry, this gym is closed for a raid or something.
3031000	3034000	Like, well, how do I join that?
3034000	3037000	You might've just walked up on it during a Mewtwo raid.
3037000	3039000	Those you have to be invited to.
3039000	3040000	And I'm a little salty.
3040000	3044000	I have never been invited to a fucking EX raid in Pokemon GO.
3044000	3046000	And I try to do the raids pretty regularly.
3046000	3047000	I don't go out of my way
3047000	3049000	to go all the way to the fucking mall
3049000	3051000	to go to Starbucks, or not Starbucks.
3052000	3056000	The mall over here that has the Sprint store.
3056000	3057000	That's what it is.
3057000	3058000	The Sprint store is a gym.
3058000	3061000	And that's the one that everybody goes to raid to get,
3061000	3063000	but I'm not going to go all the way over there
3063000	3065000	just to get a chance
3065000	3067000	that maybe I'll get to go back on Saturday.
3067000	3069000	You know what's going to happen to me though, Loki.
3069000	3070000	I'm going to tell you right now what's going to happen.
3070000	3073000	I'm going to get an EX pass for next Saturday,
3073000	3074000	but what's the punchline?
3076000	3077000	You're going to be out of town.
3077000	3078000	No, I'm going to get a pass.
3078000	3080000	Close, that would be the other one,
3080000	3082000	is that I'll get a pass for next next Saturday
3082000	3083000	when I'm going to be out of town.
3083000	3086000	But I'm going to get a pass for this Saturday in San Francisco.
3086000	3087000	Watch.
3088000	3089000	Because I did some raids there.
3089000	3090000	I bet you anything.
3090000	3093000	I get a pass that's going to make me go back to Pier 39.
3095000	3096000	But the good news is,
3096000	3098000	at least I know there'll be a group to do it
3098000	3101000	because there is nothing but spoofers in that.
3101000	3102000	In Fisherman's Wharf,
3102000	3103000	it is nothing but fucking spoofers.
3103000	3104000	Well, I shouldn't say that.
3104000	3109000	We did the Rayquaza raid at this place called The Room Blue Jeans,
3109000	3110000	is what it's called,
3110000	3113000	because they still have a poster for The Room.
3113000	3116000	You know that movie, The Citizen Kane of bad movies?
3116000	3119000	I did a hosting of it here in Sac and all that long ago.
3119000	3121000	They still have a poster of The Room up in San Francisco
3121000	3123000	because the movie's set there.
3123000	3125000	So that happens to be a Pokémon gym, right?
3125000	3127000	So we get there and we get there right as it starts.
3127000	3129000	And so we go in the gym right as it starts
3129000	3133000	and we just know we don't even need to wait for other people.
3133000	3134000	Watch what's going to happen.
3134000	3137000	And sure enough, fills up to 20 people like that.
3137000	3138000	And we look around.
3138000	3142000	We see two other guys on their phone playing Pokémon GO.
3142000	3145000	One other guy that might be playing Pokémon GO
3145000	3146000	but he also might be getting a lift.
3146000	3148000	And that's it.
3148000	3151000	So at most, of the 20 people that were in that raid,
3151000	3153000	five of them were legitimate.
3153000	3157000	So that's the state of Pokémon GO right now.
3157000	3160000	But at least that Rayquaza melted.
3160000	3162000	So that was kind of cool, I guess.
3162000	3164000	Alright, anyway.
3164000	3169000	ActDeftInChat says, I have three Rayquazas.
3169000	3170000	I still only have one.
3170000	3173000	I have the worst time throwing the fucking ball at those Rayquazas.
3173000	3175000	Like, I'm lucky if I connect twice.
3175000	3180000	And I just, by some miracle of God, the first Rayquaza raid I did,
3180000	3183000	the second ball I threw, I managed to catch it.
3183000	3184000	And I was like, thank God.
3184000	3186000	And it was even a wonder.
3186000	3189000	It was a wonder Rayquaza, so good enough.
3189000	3191000	Like, sure, I'd love to get a 100% Rayquaza.
3191000	3193000	But you know what? Good enough.
3193000	3195000	I'm going to settle for a C.
3195000	3196000	So how do you know if they're a wonder or not?
3196000	3197000	You do the appraisal.
3197000	3198000	You're mystic, right?
3198000	3199000	Yeah.
3199000	3202000	You do the appraisal and she'll say, this Pokémon is a wonder.
3202000	3204000	Valor and Instinct, they say different things.
3204000	3208000	But they're just, it's whatever the best sounding expression is that they say.
3208000	3209000	Got it.
3209000	3211000	Is the highest IV.
3211000	3214000	It's between, I think, is it 80% above or 85% above?
3214000	3216000	It might be 80. I think it's 80% and above.
3216000	3223000	But honestly, like, I don't think the IVs matter that much for what the game is.
3223000	3229000	But I feel like for PvP, a lot of people are concerned that maybe it is going to matter a lot more in PvP.
3229000	3230000	So we'll see.
3230000	3231000	All right.
3233000	3240000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at thevognetwork.com, use the passphrase, curve.
3240000	3242000	Anyway, let's move on.
3242000	3244000	I talked more than enough about Pokémon GO.
3244000	3248000	Let's move on into some actual gaming news.
3248000	3250000	I would say some announcements, though, real quick.
3250000	3252000	We will not be here in two weeks.
3252000	3255000	I'm going to be out of town in two weeks, so there's no show March 25th.
3255000	3258000	Unfortunately, we're also not going to be here April 1st.
3258000	3260000	And that is not an April Fool's Day joke.
3260000	3262000	April Fool's Day is also Easter this year.
3262000	3267000	And Loki has family obligations and Dark Sakura has obligations with her charity group that she works with.
3267000	3270000	So we won't be here live either of those two nights.
3270000	3275000	However, we don't want to miss two shows in a row, so we are making plans to try to tape something at some point.
3275000	3278000	So we'll at least have a new show on April 1st.
3278000	3279000	It just won't be live.
3279000	3281000	So sorry to our live folks.
3281000	3285000	We should tape a Ready Player One special show.
3285000	3292000	Maybe. We can go on a group date, see the movie, and then do a chat about it, whatever else happened in the news.
3292000	3293000	I'm down with that, sure.
3293000	3294000	Yes, we should.
3294000	3297000	It'll be great, too, if Jamie and I fucking hate the movie.
3297000	3299000	It's a Spielberg movie.
3299000	3300000	What's the hate?
3300000	3304000	I don't like all his movies. Some of them are not that great.
3304000	3310000	But the ones I don't like are the ones that everybody, kind of like the big award winners and stuff, and I'm like, okay.
3310000	3314000	I think Spielberg's overrated, but at the same time, like, I love Hook.
3314000	3316000	But that's the one everybody hates.
3316000	3318000	Well, all the critics hate it.
3318000	3321000	Yeah, if the critics hate it, I'll love it.
3321000	3323000	If the critics love it, I'll hate it.
3323000	3328000	I think people already hate it because, I don't know, people are haters.
3328000	3331000	I'm really excited about it. I want to see it.
3331000	3332000	I know you do.
3332000	3336000	And I've already spoiled it for myself by reading leaked scripts, so I already know what kind of happens.
3336000	3338000	It's based on a book, right?
3338000	3339000	It doesn't follow the book.
3339000	3340000	Oh.
3340000	3348000	It doesn't follow the book exactly. It sort of follows the book, but the challenges that are in it are different from the book.
3348000	3353000	Bobby Black Wolf in Chat says, I'm tired of the hype. Where are you seeing it?
3354000	3359000	Maybe it's just because I don't watch enough TV or whatever, but I feel like I'm not really seeing a lot of it.
3359000	3365000	There's some trailers, but like, I don't know. It looks good. I want to see it.
3365000	3367000	I'm sure we'll see.
3367000	3369000	I'm seeing it opening day.
3369000	3371000	Why wouldn't I see it? I don't know. Alright.
3371000	3376000	Let's get into some gaming news. Let's not oversaturate it anymore for Bobby. Let's go right into the news.
3376000	3391000	Let's talk about Fortnite. So Fortnite is coming to mobile platforms, and they're also going to allow you to actually play with, you know, it's going to basically be very similar to the game that's on consoles and PC right now.
3391000	3398000	With the whole, they're going to support like cross-play, so you're going to be able to cross-progression.
3398000	3405000	So you'll be able to, between the PlayStation 4, PC, Mac, iOS, and Android, you'll be able to sync that.
3405000	3413000	This is kind of strange, where it's, you know, syncing with Sony and not Microsoft.
3413000	3417000	Usually Sony's the one that's like, no, no, no, we can't do that.
3417000	3431000	But you'll be able to sync your progress across those, and of course, you know, I guess they're going to start rolling it out on Monday, and you can sign up, and I guess Android will be coming in the next few months.
3432000	3435000	It's going to be interesting to see how that plays out.
3435000	3436000	Mobile, though?
3436000	3437000	Yeah.
3437000	3442000	That's the thing, mobile? Those are going to be the easiest targets.
3442000	3448000	I just can't even, keyboard and mouse versus mobile. Am I understanding this right?
3448000	3454000	Well, you could do, you know, controller or something like that, you know, you could sync something to it.
3454000	3457000	But yeah, I don't know if I'd want to play Fortnite.
3457000	3466000	Also, you know, Fortnite, I hope no one's playing on a mobile network, because that's going to be even worse. I don't know.
3466000	3477000	I mean, I get that Androids and iPhones are really powerful little computers in your pocket, and we sometimes forget just how meaty those chips are that are in them and stuff.
3477000	3487000	I mean, they are pretty impressive pieces of technology, but mobile? Like, touch controls? It's going to be, you're right, you have to hook up like a Bluetooth.
3487000	3494000	But, you know, your choices are so limited over on, like, there's no official Apple controller type of thing.
3494000	3498000	You know, I'm sure, I know there's a ton of stuff on Google, but, you know.
3498000	3503000	Not even really with Android either. I mean, it's more of like, there's some support for certain things.
3503000	3508000	You can, I think on the Android, you can sync also like a PlayStation 4 controller and stuff.
3508000	3512000	But I don't know if you have to have that rooted to fully support that.
3512000	3519000	I know the one I have is pretty nice. It's like an Xbox 360 controller, but it's, you know, and that supports you.
3519000	3524000	But, I don't know. Yeah, mobile. I know.
3524000	3528000	If I had a choice, I'll just wait and I'll play it at home. Yeah.
3528000	3532000	Now, the console and PC, that's exciting. You know, that's very cool.
3532000	3535000	A lot of people wish Overwatch would do that, but I understand.
3535000	3542000	But, I mean, you would think that if it supported mobile, then maybe you could get it to run on the Switch?
3542000	3544000	Nothing official yet.
3544000	3548000	You know, I mean, I would think that would be a better option than mobile.
3548000	3553000	SSJ100Matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Fortnite wants to go the Microsoft route.
3553000	3557000	Get it on every possible platform while it's still hot. Oh, I'm sure.
3557000	3562000	You know, a lot of this has to do, and the fact that Sony kind of, you know, caved on some of their cross-platform stuff,
3562000	3565000	it just has to do with how big Fortnite is right now.
3565000	3573000	And, I would imagine Microsoft has left out a little bit because they've investigated all their stuff in PUBG, right?
3573000	3576000	Might have something to do with it.
3576000	3579000	Maybe. So, is like the Fortnite vanilla game still a thing?
3579000	3582000	Because I remember that was going to be like a zombie survival game, and...
3582000	3584000	I believe it's still there.
3584000	3586000	Did you just say, fuck that, let's do the Battle Royale thing?
3586000	3590000	No, I'm pretty sure Fortnite single-player is still a thing.
3590000	3593000	It's just, that's not what people were really talking about.
3593000	3600000	It's just like, you know, in Overwatch you can play against AI, but nobody ever talks about that.
3600000	3602000	And I do!
3602000	3609000	Alright. Anyway, so, how many of y'all checked out the Chrono Trigger release on PC recently?
3609000	3611000	No thanks, I read the reviews.
3611000	3616000	Yeah, speaking of mobile stuff going to PC, yeah...
3616000	3621000	In fact, the game is mostly negative on Steam right now.
3621000	3624000	39% is where it was sitting at earlier this week.
3624000	3627000	So Square Enix actually went to the Steam news page to say,
3627000	3631000	Hi everyone, thank you for the feedback you've shared so far regarding Chrono Trigger.
3631000	3634000	We wanted to let you know that we are reading and listening to your messages,
3634000	3637000	and are aware of all the issues you've raised, which we're currently assessing.
3637000	3640000	Please keep an eye on the Steam page for further information.
3640000	3643000	Thanks for your patience and support, the Chrono Trigger team.
3643000	3646000	Now here's the thing, what are they going to be able to fix?
3646000	3647000	They ported the mobile game.
3647000	3652000	I mean, are they going to have to go back and just basically change the mobile game to fix some of these issues?
3652000	3659000	Which include, by the way, crappy controller stuff because it's adapted from a touchscreen thing,
3659000	3662000	so the controller doesn't do what you think it would do.
3662000	3668000	Some of the horrible RuPaul's Drag Race Season 1 filter that's applied to the sprite artwork,
3668000	3672000	if you don't know what I'm talking about, imagine you smeared Vaseline all over the lens.
3672000	3674000	That's what the game looks like.
3674000	3678000	So, yeah, it's just, it's not great.
3678000	3680000	And so, what are they going to do though?
3680000	3685000	It's a company cutting corners because they thought, oh, Chrono Trigger, people are going to want it.
3685000	3687000	And they cut corners.
3687000	3692000	By saying cut corners, it was, we released the mobile ports of Final Fantasy IV, V, and VI,
3692000	3697000	and they did pretty well, so put Chrono Trigger in the queue, let's do that one too.
3698000	3700000	That's what they did.
3700000	3702000	Well.
3702000	3704000	But, here's the interesting thing.
3704000	3707000	Modders have now entered the picture.
3707000	3712000	Uh-oh, now, here's why they waited a while to put it on PC because now, you know, what do we say?
3712000	3717000	Hackers going to hack, and right along with that, modders going to mod, right?
3717000	3723000	So, apparently, some of the things that they have been doing with the game is,
3723000	3732000	the modders have jumped in, and let's see, there's a tool called Final Fantasy VI Explorer,
3732000	3736000	and that was used on the Final Fantasy VI port that was kind of eh.
3736000	3740000	And Final Fantasy VI Explorer let other modders dig in the files, understand what's going on,
3740000	3744000	and replace sprites and other assets to make things look better.
3744000	3751000	And sure enough, went in there, there's an update now to CT Explorer with modding capability,
3751000	3753000	and that was all announced on this guy's Twitter.
3753000	3758000	That's my trunks, is the tweet, and already people are going in there with the CT tool
3758000	3762000	and fixing up some of the sprites and things like that.
3762000	3765000	So, uh, yeah, modders are getting in there and already working,
3765000	3767000	and you can see some of their results all around the internet.
3767000	3771000	There's also Steam forum threads on that, and so on and so on.
3771000	3775000	So, kind of unsurprised that that's happening.
3775000	3779000	Sj100matt in chat says, Hackers going to fix the game.
3779000	3784000	AkumaJP says, Chrono Trigger Porn. Anything is possible.
3784000	3786000	I'm sure you can-
3786000	3790000	Where are we on the porn for Final Fantasy XV, or like, you know, the-
3790000	3793000	I'm sure they've got nude mods and shit already.
3793000	3795000	Oh, oh, oh, for the PC release?
3795000	3796000	Yes.
3796000	3798000	I don't know, I haven't heard about nude mods for Final Fantasy XV.
3798000	3801000	I mean, it's only been a couple days, but-
3801000	3802000	Long enough.
3802000	3804000	It's been a couple days, I mean, come on.
3804000	3806000	I expect that stuff immediately.
3806000	3810000	But I would just assume that, you know, that they do have that already.
3810000	3815000	Um, let's see, I, uh, I'm looking, and I'm getting a lot of hits,
3815000	3818000	so I, of course, I googled nude mods for Final Fantasy XV,
3818000	3822000	and we're getting a lot of hits on the article that talked about-
3822000	3824000	Please no nude mods, yeah.
3824000	3827000	That that would be up to the player base, like, the creators of the game were like,
3827000	3832000	that's what you want to do, it's out of our control, right, basically?
3832000	3835000	Uh, and then one of the big hits here from the Steam community,
3835000	3838000	nude Cindy mod, please.
3838000	3840000	Of course, of course.
3840000	3841000	Right?
3841000	3842000	Of course.
3842000	3845000	Uh, but then there's a link here, uh, I think that, no,
3845000	3847000	I think that's just that same news story.
3847000	3848000	So maybe the smart-
3848000	3849000	Maybe not yet.
3849000	3852000	Yeah, the smart thing about commenting on the news story
3852000	3855000	is that all the game blogs ran that news story,
3855000	3858000	so when you search for Final Fantasy XV nude mod, you get that news story.
3858000	3861000	So it makes it harder to find the actual nude mod.
3861000	3864000	But I'm sure that will be a thing that happens at some point.
3864000	3865000	Alright.
3865000	3868000	Uh, Slidekick in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
3868000	3870000	hi Slidekick, says, uh,
3870000	3874000	surprising that Loki is asking about Final Fantasy XV nude mods, but bless,
3874000	3878000	except he probably only cares about nude Cindy, not nude Gladiel.
3878000	3881000	Look, here's the thing, knowing Loki as long as I have,
3881000	3883000	Loki just knows it's gonna happen.
3883000	3884000	Like, Loki doesn't-
3884000	3886000	Yeah, this is a matter, it's not necessarily-
3886000	3888000	Loki doesn't have, like, a vested interest in this.
3888000	3892000	No, it's not that, it's like, it's like a, um, what do we call it?
3892000	3895000	This is something he's gonna show the wife, they're gonna laugh at,
3895000	3896000	and then move on.
3896000	3897000	Oh, the wife doesn't care?
3897000	3898000	Like, I thought it was gonna, like,
3898000	3901000	hey, I'm gonna show you some mod on the game site,
3901000	3903000	I'm already tuning you out, you said games.
3903000	3905000	You guys used to do this years ago, I-
3905000	3906000	Show you.
3906000	3909000	Back when we lived together, you would show her hilarious stuff
3909000	3911000	and she'd laugh at it, so.
3911000	3912000	She doesn't care.
3912000	3915000	Video games are so stupid, you guys are stupid,
3915000	3916000	and you do that stupid show.
3917000	3919000	God, you're still doing that show?
3919000	3921000	Why are you still doing that show?
3922000	3924000	Is that show still not making you money?
3925000	3927000	It's a hobby, if you're not making money,
3927000	3929000	it's a hobby, it's not a job.
3929000	3930000	It's a hobby.
3930000	3933000	And we wouldn't have met any of these fine people out here on the internet
3933000	3934000	if it wasn't for this hobby.
3934000	3936000	I don't see anything on ModDB, so I'm assuming-
3936000	3938000	Alright, no nude mod yet.
3938000	3939000	Slag kick?
3939000	3942000	It's just, it's up to you to make it.
3942000	3943000	Get to work.
3943000	3944000	Because eventually it's gonna be like,
3944000	3949000	Okay, this mod turns a cactuar into, like, a multi-faceted dick monster that,
3949000	3951000	you know, and oh, it's just-
3951000	3953000	That's not the same thing.
3953000	3957000	And then we gotta get Macho Man Randy Savage in there somewhere, you know.
3959000	3960000	That's the kind of-
3960000	3961000	I wanna play-
3961000	3962000	That's the shit that's gonna make me-
3962000	3967000	I wanna play my Final Fantasy XV like I play my Skyrim.
3967000	3970000	Macho Man Randy Savage, boobs everywhere,
3970000	3972000	and like the fucking dubstep gun.
3972000	3974000	And like the fucking dubstep gun.
3974000	3975000	That is how I wanna play my game.
3975000	3979000	That's gonna be the shit that finally convinces me to get Final Fantasy XV on PC.
3979000	3981000	Even though I've been resisting, like,
3981000	3984000	No, Rob, the game was mediocre, do not buy it again.
3984000	3987000	When you talk about, like, Macho Man Randy Savage,
3987000	3988000	I- I-
3988000	3990000	Boobs are funny, whatever.
3990000	3991000	Like, sure, put boobs in it.
3991000	3994000	They've turned their car into Thomas the Tank Engine.
3994000	3996000	Yeah, sure, and Macho Man Randy Savage.
3996000	3997000	Oh yeah, like, why not?
3997000	3999000	Do all of it and I'm there.
3999000	4000000	I'm sold.
4001000	4002000	Sure.
4002000	4003000	Sure. Alright.
4006000	4009000	And, you know what else would be really funny, okay?
4009000	4012000	So you know how Ignis cooks after every meal.
4012000	4018000	What Ignis should be cooking is the remains of the creatures that they've killed.
4018000	4021000	So I wanna see an Ignis cooking mod where he's making, like,
4021000	4025000	And tonight we dine on roasted Chocobo, you know, so.
4025000	4029000	We've cooked the Macho Man Randy Savage and we've gotten Slim Jims.
4031000	4034000	Bobby Blackwool says,
4034000	4037000	Ignis is cooking the last fucks that he had to give.
4037000	4038000	Correct. Correct.
4038000	4039000	He's cooking some mess.
4039000	4041000	Ignis is cooking Chapter 13.
4043000	4045000	Oh, I like that idea too.
4045000	4047000	Final Fantasy XV My Little Drug Lab.
4049000	4050000	Alright.
4050000	4052000	Please, a new story. Loki.
4052000	4054000	Alright, let's talk about Call of Duty.
4054000	4057000	So Call of Duty is not going back to World War II again,
4057000	4060000	it's going back to the future, I think.
4060000	4066000	So it's Black Ops 4 is gonna be the official game coming out this year.
4066000	4069000	Somewhere I miss Black Ops 3.
4069000	4071000	I know it exists, but I never played it.
4071000	4074000	And I'm trying to think back in my head why I didn't play it,
4074000	4076000	because I like Black Ops 2.
4076000	4080000	And I know Infinity Warfare looked kind of ridiculous and stupid,
4080000	4083000	but I just don't remember playing Black Ops 3.
4083000	4085000	But I may have to check this out.
4085000	4090000	Anyway, so they're gonna have a reveal event for the community on May 17th.
4090000	4093000	The global launch of the game is kind of surprising.
4093000	4096000	Usually that's gonna be a game that they release in November.
4096000	4098000	This year, though, releasing in October.
4098000	4102000	On October 12th for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
4102000	4104000	It doesn't seem that early.
4104000	4106000	It's still the right season.
4106000	4109000	Considering all the launches for past Call of Duty games,
4109000	4111000	it's definitely a deviation.
4111000	4112000	Alright, alright. Fair enough.
4112000	4114000	So they didn't really say what it's about,
4114000	4116000	but I just hope it's not stupid.
4116000	4118000	Please don't be stupid.
4120000	4124000	If they're not making the Call of Duty...
4124000	4126000	Because they're not putting this on Switch, right?
4126000	4127000	They haven't talked about this yet?
4127000	4128000	No, they're not putting it on Switch.
4128000	4129000	They're not putting it on Switch.
4129000	4132000	Well, I guess something that is coming to Switch is
4132000	4135000	Game Maker Studio 2 is gonna be coming out for the Nintendo Switch.
4135000	4139000	And this is a program that they use to make a lot of different 2D games.
4139000	4142000	In fact, I think Undertale was made in this game?
4142000	4144000	I could be wrong.
4147000	4150000	Spelunky was Game Maker as well.
4150000	4151000	Was it?
4151000	4152000	Yeah, that was a pretty good game.
4152000	4155000	There's been a lot of really good games that have come out for Game Maker.
4157000	4158000	I don't know.
4158000	4162000	So for example, they've got it coming to the Switch.
4162000	4164000	They do.
4164000	4166000	Oh, here we go. Other games.
4166000	4168000	Hotline Miami was built on that tool as well.
4168000	4169000	Did you know that?
4169000	4173000	Anyway, but the cool thing is that it is coming out Game Maker 2
4173000	4177000	and you're gonna be able to, I guess, export your stuff to the Switch.
4177000	4179000	And it's gonna be launching this summer.
4179000	4182000	YoYo Games' James Cox said,
4182000	4186000	Nintendo has been hugely supportive of bringing independent releases to the Nintendo Switch console.
4186000	4190000	And this partnership will mean even more wonderful games are released on the platforms.
4190000	4191000	That's gonna be pretty cool.
4191000	4196000	Anything that makes it easier for people to put their games on consoles?
4196000	4199000	I mean, back when I was little and like,
4199000	4203000	oh man, it'd be so amazing to be able to publish a game on a console and be able to play that game.
4203000	4207000	Now it's actually much easier to do that than it used to be.
4207000	4211000	And to be clear, it's not that Game Maker, the program is on the Switch
4211000	4215000	because you have to write code and things the Switch doesn't do.
4215000	4220000	But they're coming out with a version of Game Maker that is for exporting to the Switch.
4220000	4224000	Well, it's basically a plugin that they have for Game Maker to export to different platforms.
4224000	4227000	So right now they've got, you know, you can do mobile platforms.
4227000	4230000	You can do, you know, the PC.
4230000	4232000	You can do some consoles as well.
4232000	4234000	Now they're having the Switch as one of the options.
4234000	4238000	It's kind of like how Unity has those where you build for a certain target platform.
4238000	4241000	Bobby Black Wolf of Chat says, Game Maker is great for 2D games.
4241000	4243000	It's preferable to Unity in that sense.
4243000	4248000	If I'm not mistaken, aren't your 2D games in Unity like basically faked 3D?
4248000	4249000	If I remember right?
4249000	4251000	It's changed a lot.
4251000	4255000	So they have like a big focus on 2D stuff now too.
4255000	4258000	I mean, it's hard to keep up with everything.
4258000	4266000	Like recently they've even added more stuff to Unity to make it, it seems like, a little bit more like Unreal
4266000	4273000	where they have, they bought the rights to, god I can't remember the program I have, the plugin too.
4273000	4276000	But it's basically to build 3D models within Unity.
4276000	4285000	So you can build out a map in Unity in the editor without having to go build the model and import it and all that stuff.
4285000	4286000	So they've got that.
4286000	4291000	But yeah, it is definitely pretty strong for 2D games.
4291000	4293000	That's what it's been used for.
4293000	4298000	I don't know about Game Maker making 3D games, but we're checking out.
4298000	4303000	And especially if you catch it, every now and then they put Humble Bundles out there with Game Maker in there.
4303000	4305000	Yeah, they do, and I missed the last one.
4305000	4308000	I tend to grab it, even though I don't use it.
4308000	4313000	I'm like, well someday I might decide I want to use it, and I want the keys, so I've got the keys.
4313000	4318000	I think I have Game Maker 1 though, where the last one was, so I don't know.
4318000	4321000	Bobby is emphasizing in chat, Game Maker doesn't do 3D games.
4321000	4326000	It specializes in 2D, and that's why people tend to float to that for 2D.
4326000	4332000	Although, heck, there's still people making games in Commodore 64 Basic.
4332000	4334000	So people are going to program on whatever they want.
4334000	4335000	Do whatever works for you.
4335000	4336000	That's right, do whatever works for you.
4336000	4340000	People are still making Atari 2600 games all these years later.
4340000	4341000	Why not?
4341000	4343000	Loki, what do you have?
4343000	4347000	So, speaking of more games coming to the Switch and other platforms,
4347000	4350000	Crash Bandicoot Trilogy, we mentioned it was coming to the Switch,
4350000	4354000	but not only that, it's not just now going to be exclusive to two platforms,
4354000	4357000	but it's also coming out on Xbox One and PC as well.
4357000	4360000	So that exclusivity for PlayStation 4 is done,
4360000	4366000	and they're going to be coming, I guess, to those platforms on July 10th.
4366000	4370000	I'm sorry, but Crash Bandicoot on the Xbox,
4370000	4375000	that's like as big to me as Sonic on a Nintendo platform.
4375000	4379000	I realized that Sony didn't make Crash Bandicoot,
4379000	4383000	but it's just like, in my childhood, you really associated Crash Bandicoot with Sony.
4383000	4385000	They've had Xbox Crash games, I thought.
4385000	4386000	Did they?
4386000	4389000	Yeah, I remember selling some on the Xbox 360.
4389000	4392000	I know they had the Crash Tag Team Racing was one.
4392000	4394000	Oh, yeah, that's true.
4394000	4398000	I thought that they had another one, too, that was like Xbox or Xbox 360.
4398000	4400000	These weren't good games, that's why I forgot them.
4400000	4403000	Yeah, that was back when everyone wanted to make a kart racing game,
4403000	4407000	like Sonic was doing it, Sony was doing it.
4407000	4411000	Everyone's got to steal Nintendo's thunder.
4411000	4417000	Come on, Sony, give the fighter all-stars thing another shot.
4418000	4421000	Wasn't that terrible?
4421000	4426000	We got the Bioshock guy in there.
4426000	4430000	I would love to see that again, but more battle royale games,
4430000	4431000	or more fighting games like that.
4431000	4434000	Well, maybe a PlayStation All-Stars battle royale game
4434000	4438000	could be a launch title for the PlayStation 5.
4438000	4441000	That's right, I'm going to talk about the PlayStation 5, y'all.
4441000	4442000	Oh, boy.
4442000	4445000	All right, here we go, here's what's happening.
4445000	4448000	I can already hear Bobby's eyes rolling to the back of his head
4448000	4453000	and taking a big, deep sigh as we explore what's happening in PlayStation 5.
4453000	4455000	But here's the real deal.
4455000	4457000	Obviously, PlayStation 5 is under development.
4457000	4461000	Are you saying that the PlayStation 4 Pro is not doing amazingly well?
4461000	4463000	It's not even that, Loki.
4463000	4466000	The PlayStation 5 was in development the day they released the PlayStation 4,
4466000	4467000	if not sooner.
4467000	4471000	That's how far out these things have to be planned.
4471000	4474000	And we know that, you know, let's say they are planning
4474000	4477000	on releasing a PlayStation 5 in...
4477000	4479000	And I'm sorry if you guys just heard my Google chat go off.
4479000	4481000	Like, the one time I freaking leave that open,
4481000	4483000	I, bleh, we get messages. Sorry, that was me.
4483000	4487000	Anyway, where was I? Dang it.
4487000	4488000	And that derailed what I was talking about.
4488000	4489000	Oh, yeah, PlayStation 5.
4489000	4493000	So these launch games for PlayStation 5, assuming they run 4K,
4493000	4497000	and assuming they are, like, really smooth, you know, running and all that,
4497000	4500000	and that these are things we're going to expect out of PlayStation 5,
4500000	4505000	these studios are going to need years to develop a game for this system.
4505000	4508000	So it would not be surprising that even if they are not planning
4508000	4511000	to release PlayStation 5 until 2020,
4511000	4514000	that we start hearing this news, and that's what we have tonight,
4514000	4520000	that PlayStation 5 dev kits have been sent to some third-party studios.
4520000	4524000	This rumor coming from Marcus Sellers over on Twitter,
4524000	4528000	but, and you might just think, well, why should I trust some rando guy on Twitter?
4528000	4534000	Well, this same rando guy also said that Black Ops 4 would be this year's call of duty,
4534000	4536000	and that turned out to be true.
4536000	4537000	That's just a guess.
4537000	4542000	And the correct date of the Nintendo Direct before it was announced.
4542000	4548000	This guy has also said that Nintendo Switch Diablo 3 port is happening.
4548000	4553000	We didn't see that in the Direct, but, I mean, it hasn't really been denied either totally,
4553000	4557000	so we'll see. I would say if that wasn't announced still at E3, then it's not happening.
4557000	4558000	But we'll see.
4558000	4561000	Anyway, so take it with a grain of salt.
4561000	4564000	That was the tweet made saying basically PlayStation 5 dev kits
4564000	4567000	went out early this year to third-party developers.
4567000	4571000	But honestly, like, why wouldn't I believe that?
4571000	4574000	That doesn't mean they're announcing the PlayStation 5 at E3.
4574000	4579000	It just means it's time to start thinking about 2020.
4579000	4581000	And I would think 20-
4581000	4584000	But I thought they were on a 10-year cycle. What happened to that?
4584000	4587000	Yeah, but the PlayStation 3 is on a 10-year cycle as well,
4587000	4591000	but that doesn't mean the PlayStation 4 wasn't already out for the last few years.
4591000	4592000	Right?
4592000	4593000	Eh, whatever.
4593000	4597000	Okay, so the PlayStation 4 came out 2013, right?
4597000	4600000	That's when the PlayStation 4 came out, 2013.
4600000	4603000	PlayStation 3 was out 2000-
4603000	4605000	No, yeah, 2006.
4605000	4609000	So that was seven years between PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.
4609000	4613000	So 2020 would be seven years from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5.
4613000	4616000	But it's only been one year since PlayStation 4 Pro.
4616000	4617000	Actually, not even one year.
4617000	4618000	Well...
4618000	4619000	Six months.
4619000	4620000	Well...
4620000	4623000	I'm not really con- I mean, the PlayStation 4 Pro is-
4623000	4626000	Well, I guess this goes back to we're just gonna iterate
4626000	4629000	and gonna release a new console every year or some bullshit or...
4630000	4632000	But, like, at this point, like, I get it.
4632000	4637000	I get it that, you know, you want a more powerful console, but...
4637000	4638000	Guess what?
4638000	4640000	Microsoft is doing the same thing.
4640000	4642000	It's not even Xbox One X.
4643000	4646000	I feel we're getting to the point of divisionist returns here.
4646000	4647000	It's like...
4647000	4650000	How much better are we gonna...
4650000	4652000	What exactly improvements are we gonna see?
4652000	4656000	I mean, smoother gameplay and 4K visuals natively are...
4656000	4659000	Well, hopefully this time, but, like...
4659000	4663000	It's gonna get to a point where we can't, you know...
4663000	4666000	It's not gonna be worth it, I guess.
4666000	4670000	I would say things that are gonna help the developers make their games.
4670000	4674000	Like, consoles that help out developers and aren't as challenging to develop for.
4674000	4676000	And what I mean by that is that, you know, you guys,
4676000	4679000	if we're gonna have, like, artists making 4K assets for all these games,
4679000	4682000	games are gonna take even fucking longer to finish.
4682000	4686000	So, if we don't, you know, have a system that kind of helps developers
4686000	4689000	in getting done what they need to do, like...
4689000	4690000	You know what I mean?
4690000	4691000	Right.
4691000	4694000	So, that's the thing we need most out of PlayStation 5.
4694000	4697000	I know that sounds really weird, but I think, I mean,
4697000	4702000	you're gonna be looking at games that are on, like, five- and six-year development cycles
4702000	4704000	if we don't have some of those things figured out.
4704000	4705000	Not necessarily.
4705000	4708000	That's only if you really wanna push it to that kind of quality, but...
4708000	4709000	I guess.
4709000	4711000	Not every game has to be that quality to be a success.
4711000	4713000	That's what my point is, like...
4713000	4717000	I get it. You wanna push the hardware so they can do more, make prettier games and stuff,
4717000	4720000	but does a prettier game necessarily make it a better game?
4720000	4723000	Not really. Not necessarily.
4723000	4724000	So...
4725000	4727000	I don't know. I think you need to focus more on, like...
4728000	4731000	We need to make games better. How can we make games better?
4731000	4734000	Could it be that they're more immersive? Could we find, like, a new method?
4734000	4735000	Like...
4735000	4737000	What's our next step towards the holodeck?
4737000	4739000	Is really what we should be saying.
4739000	4741000	What's our next step towards the holodeck?
4741000	4743000	What can we add to the experience to make games more immersive?
4743000	4748000	Because, like, if you argue it, look at, like, the PlayStation VR or even, like, any VR platform.
4748000	4752000	It's not necessarily that the graphics are better, but it's a more immersive experience
4752000	4755000	which makes it seem better than some of the other games that are out there
4755000	4759000	because it's different. It puts you more inside it.
4759000	4765000	And, yes, having more powerful hardware to push those visuals for VR or something like that would help as well,
4765000	4771000	but I just think we're getting to a point now where, like, even, like, the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro,
4771000	4775000	it's like, if I was gonna play it on PlayStation VR, it's a slight visual improvement.
4775000	4779000	Or we have slightly better textures.
4779000	4784000	This one runs in 4K, but if I have a 4K TV, it's slightly crisper.
4786000	4788000	At some point, it's just not gonna matter.
4790000	4793000	Maybe they're just gonna finally make a game console that'll fuck you.
4793000	4794000	Like, maybe...
4794000	4795000	Japan's working on it.
4795000	4798000	Maybe... Maybe that's the true endgame.
4798000	4802000	I know we keep saying the endgame is the holodeck,
4802000	4807000	but in some ways I feel like the true endgame in video games is a console that'll fuck you,
4807000	4808000	and no one else will.
4808000	4811000	Like a co... Am I wrong?
4813000	4814000	You're not wrong.
4816000	4819000	On that note, let's go back to a classic time.
4821000	4823000	In video game history.
4823000	4826000	With the classic game of the week.
4826000	4829000	Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault.
4829000	4832000	Back in a simpler time with gaming consoles.
4832000	4834000	They didn't fuck you. They didn't even buy you a drink.
4835000	4839000	Well, game consoles definitely nowadays, the console games do fuck you,
4839000	4843000	as far as, like, the content that they give you for the money that you pay,
4843000	4846000	but not necessarily in a way that's pleasurable.
4851000	4855000	Anyway, Dark Sakura ain't here, and if she was, we'd probably have to behave ourselves,
4855000	4858000	and that's why this show's completely derailed tonight.
4858000	4860000	But anyway, it's the classic game of the week.
4860000	4863000	Now, usually when Dark Sakura isn't here, I take over and pick a game,
4863000	4866000	but I was thinking, you know, I shouldn't do it all the time.
4866000	4868000	Loki needs to get some picks in here, too.
4868000	4873000	So, it's Loki's turn to take over and pick the classic game of the week.
4873000	4877000	Loki, what did you pick out of the gaming vault for the classic game of the week?
4877000	4879000	Breaking all the rules. We're gonna do Halo 2, 3, and 4.
4879000	4882000	No, actually, we're doing Saints Row.
4882000	4885000	You really want to get fucked. That's one way to do it,
4885000	4886000	because you'll be dead next to each other.
4886000	4888000	Oh, Saints Row! Saints Row.
4888000	4890000	Saints Row is the classic game of the week.
4890000	4891000	Yeah, Saints Row.
4891000	4896000	So, Saints Row was a game that was going to basically revolutionize.
4896000	4899000	It was gonna be the Grand Theft Auto killer.
4899000	4900000	Grand Theft Auto killer.
4900000	4904000	So, it was a game that was developed for the PlayStation 2 originally
4904000	4906000	under the title Bling Bling.
4906000	4908000	Thank God they changed that name.
4908000	4911000	So, it actually began work in mid-2003.
4911000	4915000	And then, of course, you know, with the new consoles coming out and stuff,
4915000	4919000	eventually it came out for the Xbox 360 back in 2006.
4919000	4921000	And just so you know, I do have game audio running in the background,
4921000	4922000	but there's not really a lot of music,
4922000	4925000	and I'm just waiting for abrupt machine gun fire to interrupt this,
4925000	4927000	so just bear with us here with the audio.
4927000	4929000	Oh, yes, it's inevitable.
4929000	4933000	So, Saints Row, you played the role of the player,
4933000	4938000	or basically this brand new inductee to the 3rd Street Saints,
4938000	4942000	who are a fictional gang in a fictional city of Stillwater.
4942000	4947000	And basically, it's about you becoming integrated in this gang
4947000	4950000	and trying to take over the rest of Stillwater,
4950000	4954000	which is owned by three other gangs that are in there as well.
4954000	4957000	So, you have the three syndicates, the Vice Kings,
4957000	4962000	who are basically getting their money from strip clubs and record labels,
4962000	4966000	the Los Carnellas, who are a drug cartel,
4966000	4972000	and the West Side Rollers, who had basically an underground racing club.
4972000	4977000	So, with that, of course, you're joined by some other lieutenants
4977000	4980000	that are part of the Saints.
4980000	4985000	So, you have Johnny Gat, Dex, and Lynn.
4985000	4988000	So, as you're playing out through the game,
4988000	4993000	you meet up with other characters and start taking over the city.
4993000	5001000	Come to find out, of course, spoilers, Julius, who is played by Keith David,
5002000	5006000	ends up betraying you in the end and you get killed.
5006000	5007000	What?
5007000	5008000	Yes.
5008000	5009000	Spoilers.
5009000	5011000	Allegedly, you get killed when you come back in the second game, so it's fine.
5011000	5013000	Spoilers to the second game.
5013000	5015000	These games are ten years old.
5015000	5017000	No, but it was a great game.
5017000	5023000	So, it wasn't revolutionary in the way that it was going to beat out San Andreas
5023000	5025000	or any of the Grand Theft Auto games,
5025000	5029000	but what I really liked about the game was that it was kind of a little more
5029000	5033000	over the top than, say, like a normal Grand Theft Auto game,
5033000	5037000	whereas most of the Grand Theft Auto games were kind of sort of focusing in reality,
5037000	5041000	but they did a little bit of over-the-top stuff like the jet pack and whatnot.
5041000	5045000	Whereas Saints Row, they had a lot of different activities that were kind of over the top.
5045000	5048000	This one was a little bit more crowded than, say, Saints Row the Third,
5048000	5051000	which just kind of went crazy, but this one you had,
5051000	5053000	they kind of introduced some of the minigames in there.
5053000	5058000	They had insurance fraud, which basically you had to challenge yourself
5058000	5063000	in getting basically the most damage to the player as possible,
5063000	5066000	so running out the middle of traffic, throwing yourself off bridges,
5066000	5070000	you know, anything to rack up a big insurance bill, which is kind of fun.
5070000	5072000	Hi, cat.
5072000	5074000	He's like patting me on the leg.
5074000	5076000	Mr. Smoosh might want to come sit on your lap.
5076000	5077000	He's all, pet me, pet me.
5077000	5079000	Mr. Smoosh might be trying to come sit on your lap.
5079000	5082000	So then, you know, you have that.
5082000	5085000	There's other missions like drug trafficking.
5085000	5091000	They had, you know, where you can drop off, you know, prostitutes and stuff,
5091000	5094000	just lots of ridiculous things.
5094000	5099000	Of course, also lots of download content in the game as far as costumes and whatnot.
5099000	5103000	And the first game I actually did play multiplayer
5103000	5105000	because it was like, you know, Grand Theft Auto game,
5105000	5107000	but it also had multiplayer built into it as well.
5107000	5109000	So we used to play some of the death matches in there,
5109000	5112000	and they also had a mode called blinged out rides
5112000	5117000	where you had to basically bling your car out by getting more money and stuff.
5117000	5119000	But it was a fun game.
5119000	5124000	And I remember that they had a 30-minute demo that came out for the Xbox 360,
5124000	5126000	and I would play the crap out of that,
5126000	5129000	and I found a way to get out of bounds in that game, and that was fun.
5129000	5132000	Some other fun stuff.
5132000	5135000	They had a soundtrack of 130 musical tracks,
5135000	5138000	including the classical channel, which is great, especially playing that.
5139000	5144000	Of course, you know, drum and beat, metal, reggae, R&B, all that stuff.
5144000	5147000	Across 12 stations.
5149000	5151000	Let's see what else they had fun stuff about this.
5151000	5155000	I used to love putting in the codes in the game to get the cars to chase you down.
5155000	5157000	They had lots of little cheat codes back.
5157000	5159000	When cheat codes, you didn't have to buy them.
5159000	5161000	So that was fun.
5161000	5166000	And of course, it spawned a few additional sequels.
5166000	5175000	So you had Saints Row II that actually came out on both Xbox 360 and PC and PlayStation 3.
5175000	5177000	So that was pretty awesome.
5177000	5180000	And then, of course, Saints Row III, which came out on all three platforms as well,
5180000	5184000	and eventually got remastered for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5184000	5188000	And of course, Saints Row IV, which is just ridiculous.
5188000	5191000	And hopefully they'll have a new Saints Row game.
5191000	5195000	Of course, you know, Gata to Hell was another one as well.
5195000	5199000	But yeah, definitely worth checking out if you have an Xbox 360.
5199000	5204000	It's old. I mean, it's sort of dated looking, but it was fun.
5205000	5207000	Alright, your classic game of the week.
5207000	5210000	The original Saints Row before it went over the top.
5210000	5211000	Yes. And crazy.
5211000	5214000	But that didn't make it... It was still... It was a decent...
5214000	5216000	It was a good game. I liked it. It was a good game.
5216000	5217000	It was the start of something.
5217000	5219000	And the story was actually not bad.
5219000	5221000	Like, one of the things like ever...
5221000	5224000	You know, some of the later games, I feel that the best balance in stor...
5225000	5226000	Oh.
5227000	5229000	Okay, for those that just...
5229000	5231000	Fucking asshole.
5231000	5233000	So the cat just knocked over the trash completely.
5233000	5235000	I gotta go take care of that. Low-key.
5235000	5236000	He jumped in the trash can.
5236000	5237000	He jumped in the trash can?
5237000	5238000	He tried to jump in the trash can.
5238000	5240000	Fucking idiot. Hold on.
5241000	5244000	So like, you know, I think the best balance in the Saints Row games
5244000	5247000	were probably Saints Row II, where it was kind of...
5247000	5250000	They had, you know, three different games that basically...
5250000	5253000	Because you had died in the first game, but you didn't really die.
5253000	5254000	You were just in a coma.
5254000	5258000	And so you were in prison, and then you get broken out of prison.
5259000	5262000	And you know, come back to kind of reclaim Stillwater,
5262000	5264000	which has been taken over by three other gangs.
5264000	5268000	But the way that you take care of those gangs is really fucked up.
5268000	5271000	And like, just some of the stuff you do to get revenge.
5271000	5276000	So that's why I think that one had like a great balance between crazy and realistic.
5276000	5281000	Plus they had a lot of mini-games in there that were just, you know, off the wall crazy.
5281000	5285000	And what I liked about those games, and the first one included,
5285000	5288000	was that they kind of gave you context to the mini-games.
5288000	5290000	They said, okay, here's why you're doing this mini-game,
5290000	5292000	and here's what the purpose is of it.
5292000	5294000	Not just, here's a mini-game you're doing to get money.
5294000	5296000	You know, and if you do this, you get money.
5296000	5300000	And that's it. Like some of the further games do that, three and four.
5300000	5305000	So I like the context being in there and just instead of recycling and stuff over and over.
5305000	5308000	All right, thank you for buying me time, Loki.
5308000	5310000	Looking in chat at live.vognoteword.com.
5310000	5314000	Tigerclaw in chat says, maybe Mr. Smoosh is trying to tell you something.
5314000	5317000	What, throw this episode in the trash? Is that what you're saying, Tigerclaw?
5317000	5319000	Why don't you say it to my face?
5319000	5324000	Bobby Blackwold says, my cat likes to knock over the trash can too because she wants to see what's in it.
5324000	5329000	Luckily, nothing, because Alan had just taken the trash out before he left, so that's the good news.
5329000	5335000	Let's see, Bobby Blackwold says, Mr. Smoosh is trying to say the Saints Row series was trash
5335000	5338000	until Saints Row 3, when it became really awesome.
5338000	5343000	Sjoan Hunter Matt says, Mr. Smoosh said, fuck your show and fuck this trash.
5343000	5345000	I'm hungry and want rubs.
5345000	5349000	Well, it's funny. I was sitting there and all of a sudden I feel his paw on my...
5349000	5351000	He's like, hello.
5351000	5354000	That's what he does before jumping up there, so you dodged one there.
5354000	5359000	And then Azet in chat says, cats are assholes. I don't know why you're surprised.
5359000	5363000	I'm not surprised, but does he have to do that now?
5363000	5365000	Of course he does. Of course he does.
5365000	5369000	Alright, we're going to take a quick break while I discipline Mr. Smoosh.
5369000	5373000	We'll be right back after this quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5373000	5374000	Don't go anywhere.
5380000	5383000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5383000	5389000	Live tonight, episode number 722 already in progress for this March 11th of 2018.
5389000	5393000	By this time next week, St. Patrick's Day will have already passed.
5393000	5396000	I don't know. That was a really big deal when you were like 21 years old.
5396000	5398000	But now it's like, eh, you know.
5398000	5400000	My kids are very excited about it.
5400000	5403000	Yeah? Well, do they get to eat cookies and stuff?
5403000	5405000	How do kids celebrate St. Patrick's Day?
5405000	5407000	Usually what happens is...
5407000	5408000	Wearing green, pinching their friends?
5408000	5415000	No, the nonsense that they do, at least in the preschool, is they will go out to recess or whatever and play outside.
5415000	5421000	One of the teachers will come inside and trash the place and they'll leave like green glitter everywhere.
5421000	5424000	And be like, oh, the leprechaun came in and did all this.
5424000	5426000	Oh, that's cute. I like that.
5426000	5429000	Or they'll hide like gold or something.
5429000	5430000	Or they'll get the kids drunk.
5430000	5431000	They'll get them drunk.
5431000	5437000	They'll give the kids NyQuil and, oh, nap time's going to be three times as long so, you know, Miss Teacher can take a nap.
5437000	5439000	Alright, anyway.
5439000	5443000	Something I wanted to talk about before we get into rapid fire news.
5443000	5447000	This is more of a, like, kind of one of those things video game related that went viral.
5447000	5451000	Is that I guess, what, Google Maps did a Mario Kart thing.
5451000	5459000	Because yesterday, you know, next Saturday is St. Patrick's Day, but that means yesterday was March 10th, Mar 10, Mario.
5459000	5462000	It was Mario Day, right? Or at least I guess that's what people call it now.
5462000	5463000	That's what Nintendo would like you to believe.
5463000	5465000	That's right. Well, now Google's getting in on this too, right?
5465000	5472000	So Google actually installed what, like something within their Google Maps apps that you could actually control it as Mario, right?
5472000	5480000	Or when you, wait, I tell you that back. When you get your driving directions, because you can actually have the app show you, like, the driving.
5480000	5485000	Like it kind of like, ooh, this is how you go down the street and whoosh, you'd make a right turn here and a left turn here.
5485000	5492000	But you can actually now have the Mario in his little kart be the thing driving down the street instead of the GPS arrow.
5492000	5495000	That's kind of the big difference that they made.
5495000	5496000	So how do you do that?
5496000	5500000	Let's see. Now you got to pull up the instructions.
5500000	5503000	And I think it was only available for a limited time. It may not be there anymore.
5503000	5506000	Oh, but you can still access the Pac-Man stuff. I would have thought that they would have found it.
5506000	5513000	Well, let's see. In the Google Maps app, you have to, there's a question mark button on the bottom right of the app.
5513000	5518000	Oh, it's one week. They say it's going to be one week is around. There's a question mark button in the bottom of the app.
5518000	5521000	If you don't see the block, make sure you've updated your app.
5521000	5522000	Oh, I probably need to update.
5522000	5529000	Then if you still don't see it, you just have to be patient because it's rolling out globally throughout the day, although I would think it would be done by now.
5529000	5533000	So, yeah, you can check that out and drive around as Mario from place to place.
5533000	5537000	Just a silly little thing, but we've seen Google and Nintendo work together before, right?
5537000	5539000	Yeah, they did the Pokemon thing.
5539000	5541000	Yeah, which kind of turned into Pokemon Go, right?
5541000	5547000	Wasn't there like a thought out there that that was what led to the original conversations on Pokemon Go?
5547000	5548000	I think so.
5548000	5551000	That whole Pokemon and Google Maps thing? Oh, yeah.
5551000	5553000	Yeah, I don't have any updates for the map.
5553000	5556000	Well, it's got to be in there somewhere. Keep looking.
5556000	5563000	Yeah, Google Maps with the Mario Kart icon thing. I didn't even look. I just assumed it wasn't on iOS, but maybe it was.
5563000	5569000	I haven't seen an update come through for Google Maps in quite some time, though, so maybe, I don't know, maybe I'm behind, but we'll see.
5569000	5576000	I'll check it out and look for that. But first, we're going to get to some rapid fire news, right, Logie?
5576000	5584000	That is correct. So, let's talk a little bit about, let's see here, I'm going to have to open this back up again.
5585000	5595000	Speaking of modding and stuff, you know, Breath of the Wild has had a lot of mods come out for it, even though it is a Switch game.
5595000	5602000	It also is a Wii U game, a Wii U game that is also run in an emulator on PC.
5602000	5606000	And so, with that, people have done all sorts of character mods with the game.
5606000	5615000	We had CJ from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas in there, Sonic the Hedgehog, all sorts of crazy stuff.
5615000	5621000	Now, though, they have modded Link into Linkle. So, that's right, you can play as Linkle.
5621000	5634000	And, you know, she's available in the game if you have a way to play modded games on your PC using the CEMU Wii U emulator.
5634000	5642000	And they've done some stuff, including, I think, support for, looks like the crossbow as well.
5642000	5647000	So, she gets to use the crossbow and swords. So, pretty awesome.
5647000	5655000	It looks like a, you know, something that they should have officially done, but, oh well.
5656000	5664000	So awesome. And then, of course, getting into rumors and speculation.
5664000	5673000	Grand Theft Auto 6. There's an inside source that claims that Grand Theft Auto 6...
5673000	5676000	Rumors and speculation from sources.
5676000	5689000	Known as Project Americas is apparently going to take place in Miami or Vice City.
5692000	5698000	You know, honestly, I've seen so many rumors like, well, this is going to be Vice City for sure.
5698000	5700000	I don't think anyone knows.
5701000	5709000	But my understanding, though, was they were talking about with Grand Theft Auto Online that they were going to have, like, it be all kind of tied together.
5709000	5716000	So, you know, they were saying that maybe you would be able to travel to Vice City and Liberty Sea.
5716000	5721000	I thought Liberty Sea was supposed to be something that they were going to do at one time as well, but who knows.
5721000	5729000	They were saying that the game is supposed to be, could be released as late as 2022 and feature the first female lead character.
5729000	5732000	2022 on the PlayStation 6.
5732000	5742000	I, you know, it sounds so, like, bullshit rumor-y and, like, I don't know. I don't know.
5742000	5746000	So on the plausibility scale, this gets a 2 out of 5.
5747000	5754000	Yeah. Will there be another Grand Theft Auto game? Of fucking course there will be, because they made so much fucking money off of it.
5754000	5759000	Right now they're putting out Red Dead Redemption 2. So eventually, yes, there will be a new Grand Theft Auto game.
5761000	5772000	Is it going to be in Vice City? Maybe. Is it coming out before 2022? Hopefully. Is it going to have a first female lead? Maybe.
5772000	5780000	Like, I think these are all plausible things, but, like, is this, like, does someone really have insider information? Fuck, no they don't.
5781000	5793000	Because I could come up with bullshit like this. I've seen, like, where people are like, yeah, it's got to be in Vice City because then you can do Grand Theft Auto 6 and, you know, the roman numerals are V and I and you can have CE appear behind it.
5793000	5798000	And it's like, oh, it's Vice City, oh, so clever. No, okay, come on. It's...
5799000	5810000	Alright. Let's move on to something that's, it's more one of those half rumors, but it's more one of those, like, oh, people are jumping to this conclusion based on something that was said.
5810000	5823000	And this one makes a lot more sense than some of the stuff you just went over. Apparently, one of the community managers from CDPR, who is behind CD Projekt Red, of course, behind The Witcher 3,
5823000	5826000	one of the community managers tweeted,
5850000	5851000	Smash Brothers!
5852000	5862000	Not Smash Brothers, but very close. Soul Calibur 6, which, okay, yeah, that makes a lot of sense, actually, that Soul Calibur 6 would be a good place for Geralt to land.
5862000	5869000	That is a game, of course, in the Bandai Namco portfolio and, of course, we know there have been cameos in the game.
5869000	5875000	You know, Link was in it one time, Ezio was in Soul Calibur 5, so it's not like Geralt would be, like, completely out of place there.
5875000	5877000	He's gonna be in Ridge Racer.
5877000	5884000	No, I don't think he's gonna be in Ridge Racer. Anyway, Soul Calibur is due this year, PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5884000	5888000	Perhaps that would be a great thing to reveal at E3, who knows?
5890000	5899000	And lastly, here in Rapid Fire News, I'm sure a lot of you have already heard about this, and for some people it's kind of sad news, for other people it's kind of, well, we were just waiting for this to happen.
5899000	5908000	Toys R Us, in a very bad position right now, and according to sources from Fortune, saying that they are probably going to close all their US stores.
5908000	5909000	Oh, that sucks.
5909000	5915000	Yeah, that's because Toys R Us has not found a buyer, so they are preparing for a complete liquidation.
5915000	5919000	It sucks, but I am gonna have to take advantage of all the sales.
5919000	5925000	Yeah, I mean, for those of you gaming fans out there, there could be some real deep sales on this stuff, but who knows?
5926000	5933000	I would think the newest and greatest games, they're gonna take that inventory and shift it somewhere else. The liquidators will move that inventory to somewhere that's gonna pay more for it.
5933000	5934000	Isn't it owned by Amazon?
5934000	5935000	Toys R Us?
5935000	5936000	Yeah.
5936000	5938000	No, it's just Amazon put them out of business.
5938000	5940000	Oh, I thought that there was some connection with Amazon and Toys R Us.
5940000	5942000	I think they have a partnership, but they don't own each other.
5942000	5945000	Oh, I was gonna say they could just shift all their stuff to Amazon.
5945000	5951000	Maybe, maybe, who knows? But I would bet this would be a great time for toys to figurines, like Amiibo.
5951000	5959000	You know, if you wanted an Animal Crossing Amiibo, now's the chance, because even at Target, those Animal Crossing Amiibo are already showing up on the shelf.
5959000	5968000	And it kind of doesn't surprise me. I mean, Animal Crossing characters. Like, of course, we know Isabel. We know Resetti, right? The owl that runs the museum, right?
5968000	5976000	Okay, we know some of them, but they put out Amiibo for Animal Crossing that are like, who? Like, basic bunny and dipshit dog. Who are these people?
5976000	5978000	Basic bunny.
5979000	5984000	So, like, seriously, who are these people? So, there's lots of Amiibo that are being unloaded.
5984000	5989000	If I ever make a game that's like Animal Crossing, it's gonna have basic bunny and dipshit dog. Absolutely.
5989000	5997000	Thank you. Please, please, game makers out there, if you're making an animal game, I would appreciate cameos from basic bunny and dipshit dog.
5997000	6000000	They can live in a, they're the slumlords of your town.
6000000	6009000	Alright, anyway, so that's, that's, I think, one thing you'd expect to see clearance on. You know, Disney Infinity, if there's any of those left.
6009000	6012000	They were clearing, I think that stuff's gone by now.
6012000	6014000	Skylanders and the stuff that's still on shelves.
6014000	6022000	Skylanders, they were selling that stuff, I think, a buck a pop or something. It was, like, ridiculously cheap the last time I went there. They had a big dump bin of that stuff.
6023000	6028000	I even considered, like, should I get Skylanders just because it's so damn cheap? I was like, no, no.
6028000	6033000	I even thought about, like, the Disney Infinity stuff because they had the Finding Dory stuff. I was like, well, we don't have those.
6033000	6038000	Like, how often do we play Disney Infinity? Oh, never. Okay, so, yeah, I'm not gonna buy those.
6038000	6044000	Now, some folks in chat pointing out, Azet says they will jack up the prices before discounting.
6044000	6049000	Liquidation sales beware. And Rama kind of follows that with liquidation starts at retail price.
6049000	6053000	And Azet says you won't get discounts at the beginning. That is a good thing to keep in mind.
6053000	6058000	Any sale that was already happening will be done. Everything will be at retail price.
6058000	6065000	And then, like, maybe for the first day, it'll be 10% off retail. And then the next, you know, three days, 20% off.
6065000	6071000	Then 30, then 40, and they'll probably, you know, keep knocking it down a little bit until they finally offload everything.
6071000	6075000	But most people will have picked it clean by around the time, you know, 20% off happens.
6075000	6078000	Because I'm even thinking, like, I'm gonna go load up on Legos.
6078000	6080000	Fuck yes is what I was thinking.
6080000	6085000	But the chatters are right. They're gonna mark up the price on those Legos to the maximum possible price.
6085000	6087000	Legos are, well, Legos...
6087000	6090000	And those are things they could offload to other salespeople too. You know what I mean?
6090000	6092000	They could transfer that inventory somewhere else.
6092000	6098000	I'm usually pretty conscious of, like, what the deals are. I follow, like, a group that's Lego deals.
6098000	6102000	So they, you know, will say, hey, this store is having a sale on this thing, you know.
6103000	6108000	And I haven't really, there's not too much that's come out this year to have, like, ooh, I really need to have that.
6109000	6112000	Rama also points out the Amazon and Toys R Us connection.
6112000	6116000	Amazon used to run Toys R Us's online site.
6116000	6122000	And Azet is also stressing in chat, do your comparison shopping to see if it is actually a deal.
6124000	6128000	And I want to say they've got some plugin.
6128000	6132000	I know I had it at one time, a plugin for, like, Chrome or something like that.
6132000	6137000	They'll actually price compare for you based on, like, you can go to, I think, Amazon or something like that
6137000	6141000	and select an item and it'll tell you, is this the cheapest you can find it?
6141000	6144000	You know, is it cheaper somewhere else? You know, and that type of thing.
6144000	6149000	So I'm sure there's apps out there that do that kind of stuff and you can scan barcodes.
6149000	6152000	ActDef says it's called Honey. But I'm sure there's more than one.
6153000	6156000	I see ads for that all the time. I'm sure there's competitors too, even though that's good.
6156000	6161000	But yeah, keep that in mind. And also, like, what you should do is if you're looking at, like, getting stuff,
6161000	6165000	not being so impulsive about it, but, like, kind of have an idea of what you want to get
6165000	6168000	and keep an eye on the price on that stuff and then, you know.
6168000	6173000	But at the same time, here we are talking about how to pick Toys R Us clean like the fucking vultures we are,
6173000	6176000	but isn't it kind of sad that Toys R Us is going under?
6176000	6177000	Yeah, I'm sad.
6177000	6182000	I mean, no more stories about price tags that you have to take in the back and claim your games and stuff.
6182000	6188000	Plus, I think about all that retail space, like, what's, man, all these big stores have been closing
6188000	6191000	and what's going to go in these big retail spaces? It's kind of weird.
6191000	6193000	It's just all online nowadays, it seems like.
6193000	6194000	I know.
6194000	6196000	I mean, Circuit City's coming back.
6196000	6197000	Is it really?
6197000	6198000	Yeah, it's an online store.
6198000	6199000	Oh, of course.
6199000	6201000	But they're thinking about doing physical locations too, so.
6201000	6202000	Really?
6202000	6204000	Yeah, so that was kind of interesting.
6204000	6207000	Maybe they could reopen one of that building that still doesn't have anything in it.
6207000	6210000	They used to be the Circuit City over in, over by Sunrise Mall.
6210000	6211000	Maybe.
6211000	6212000	You know what I'm talking about, right?
6212000	6216000	It's like a Halloween store once a year, but it still looks like a fucking Circuit City.
6216000	6223000	No, they've got the one that's by, the one by Sunrise Mall, that's a Lumber Liquidators.
6223000	6224000	Oh, they finally put something in it.
6224000	6225000	Yeah, it's been there for a while.
6225000	6226000	Oh, I didn't know.
6226000	6228000	But yeah, it's Circuit City.
6228000	6230000	It's always going to be Circuit City because it looks like a Circuit City.
6230000	6232000	Oh, great.
6232000	6233000	Here comes Mr. Fuckshitup.
6233000	6235000	Yeah, Mr. Smush is whining about something, I don't know.
6235000	6237000	I'll go check his food supply and stuff in a minute here.
6237000	6240000	But first, let's get to some release dates.
6240000	6242000	And, Loki, would you mind doing the US releases?
6242000	6244000	Then you'll probably want to get prepared to do the UK releases as well.
6244000	6245000	Sure, well let's do it.
6245000	6247000	So this week we've got a few things coming out.
6247000	6252000	We have the Devil May Cry HD collection on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6252000	6255000	A game called Golem coming out on PlayStation 4.
6255000	6261000	Cube 2 on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6261000	6266000	Surviving Mars on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6266000	6268000	The game I'm definitely picking up this week,
6268000	6272000	Burnout Paradise Remastered coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6272000	6276000	And last but not least, on the Nintendo Switch, Kirby Star Allies.
6276000	6280000	I'm sure we have at least one or two listeners that are interested in picking that up.
6280000	6286000	I know of one that is probably importing it as we speak.
6286000	6288000	In fact, actdeftinchat says, I'm picking that up.
6288000	6293000	Alright, going to Japan and checking out some of the releases in Japan this week.
6293000	6298000	I think the big date over there is the 15th when we see stuff like on the PlayStation 4 this week.
6298000	6305000	We're going to see the Silver 2425 as well as Galgun 2 in regular and limited edition.
6305000	6307000	That is on PlayStation 4.
6307000	6313000	As well as Shingeki no Kaioshin 2 in a regular and collector's edition.
6313000	6317000	Also this week, Winning Post 8 2018.
6317000	6319000	If I'm not mistaken that is horse racing, right?
6319000	6321000	Winning Post is horse racing?
6321000	6322000	Yeah, I think so.
6322000	6324000	I think so. I'm trying to bring up the box to confirm.
6324000	6328000	Yes, it is. So for you Derby Owners Club fans, there you go.
6328000	6333000	And then Devil May Cry HD Collection is also out on the 15th.
6333000	6336000	So pretty busy week on the PlayStation 4 this week.
6336000	6338000	Yep, still Vita releases in Japan.
6338000	6345000	Including Shingeki no Kaioshin 2 is also on the PlayStation Vita this week.
6345000	6347000	Checking the Nintendo Switch this week.
6347000	6349000	Galgun 2 is also going to be out on the Switch.
6349000	6356000	And Winning Post 8 2018 as well as that same Shingeki no Kaioshin 2 is also there.
6356000	6359000	And then Hoshi no Kirby Star Allies.
6359000	6363000	Same date as the US and Europe on the 16th.
6363000	6365000	Quickly checking the 3DS.
6365000	6368000	Who actually, yeah, 3DS even has some releases still.
6368000	6370000	Future Card Buddy Fight.
6370000	6376000	Tanjuu or Tachi no Saikyuu Body comes out this week on the 3DS.
6376000	6379000	So you can fight alongside your little panda bear friends.
6379000	6381000	It's a card battle game is what this is.
6381000	6382000	So, neat.
6382000	6384000	How about the UK, Logie?
6384000	6387000	UK's got some stuff coming out as well.
6387000	6390000	So we've got starting off with the Raven remaster.
6390000	6393000	That's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6393000	6398000	We have a game called The Council Complete Season on Xbox One.
6398000	6402000	Devil May Cry HD Collection on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6403000	6407000	We have Surviving Mars as well coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

6414000	6419000	A game called Beast Quest on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6419000	6422000	And apparently, oh wait, that's the following week.
6422000	6423000	I thought that had been a little bit early.
6423000	6424000	That's it.
6426000	6429000	Alright, we're going to get back into some news here.
6429000	6433000	But first, we're going to take a trip to the mailbag.
6441000	6445000	Every week, you guys email us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6445000	6450000	And we dive into the mailbag and read some of our favorite letters here on air.
6450000	6456000	Except I had the stupid mailbag open earlier and I closed it somehow.
6456000	6457000	How did I do that?
6457000	6458000	I just had it up.
6458000	6460000	My gosh.
6460000	6463000	Alright, well let's see if I can get, ah good, I got right by that.
6463000	6466000	There's where browser history came in handy.
6466000	6467000	Thank you.
6467000	6468000	We do have one email tonight.
6468000	6472000	Again, participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
6472000	6476000	Let's get right into tonight's email which comes to us from Redertainment.
6476000	6479000	A serial emailer, but this one's a good one tonight.
6479000	6482000	Who links us to an article from Polygon.
6482000	6488000	Please don't ever send me stories from that website.
6488000	6498000	Now look, just to be fair to Redertainment, I don't want to make Redertainment sad because I appreciate the emails we get from Redertainment.
6498000	6500000	Redertainment is about to make fun of this article.
6500000	6504000	So I guess under those stipulations then that would be okay.
6504000	6507000	However, don't send me links to that website.
6507000	6514000	Anyway, the story that was sent is the headline, Is Mario Still a Plumber?
6514000	6517000	Wasn't this a while ago?
6517000	6519000	March 5th is when it was dated, it looks like.
6519000	6521000	Seems like so long.
6521000	6523000	So Redertainment goes on in this email.
6523000	6530000	This week a story broke that added more material to the discussion as to whether or not Mario is or is not a plumber.
6531000	6533000	When I saw this story a question came to mind.
6533000	6538000	A question that I'd like to pose to the wider Orange Lounge Radio community.
6538000	6540000	Followed by this in all caps.
6540000	6544000	What the fuck does it matter what Mario's profession is?
6544000	6549000	In what way has Mario being a plumber affected any of the Mario games?
6549000	6552000	Does Mario hit people with a pipe wrench? No.
6552000	6557000	Has Mario ever been delayed from saving the princess because he was busy snaking a drain? No.
6557000	6563000	Has Mario ever jumped into a pipe and then stopped from reaching the other end because he ran into a fatberg in the sewer? No.
6563000	6568000	Yes, you could say that the very existence of the pipe and Mario are due to him being a plumber.
6568000	6572000	But those pipes are just a delivery method inside the levels.
6572000	6577000	If Mario was another profession something else would be used as the delivery method.
6577000	6580000	If Mario was a letter carrier this delivery method would be a mailbox.
6580000	6583000	If Mario was a pizza man the delivery method would be a pizza...
6584000	6586000	I totally skipped a sentence in the email.
6586000	6588000	But you know what I meant. Mailbox, pizza box.
6588000	6592000	If Mario was a time lord the delivery method would be a TARDIS.
6592000	6595000	Even if Nintendo was adamant about using pipes as a delivery method,
6595000	6599000	Nintendo would invent some other way to legitimize the existence of the pipes.
6599000	6603000	For example, Bowser is one of those crocodiles that people think live in the sewers,
6603000	6607000	so Mario uses pipes to go and battle Bowser the sewer crocodile.
6607000	6609000	Signed, Redertainment.
6610000	6614000	So what does Mario's job fucking matter is the question that's being asked here.
6614000	6619000	Well here's the thing, and I think you kind of missed this in your email,
6619000	6623000	because people don't talk about this game enough,
6623000	6629000	but before there was Super Mario Brothers there was simply Mario Brothers.
6629000	6631000	And what happened in Mario Brothers?
6631000	6634000	You've got to think back to that plot of that original game.
6634000	6636000	What happened in Mario Brothers?
6636000	6644000	It was creatures coming out of sewer pipes that Mario and his brother Luigi had to stop, basically.
6644000	6648000	So they would knock the little turtles and stuff over,
6648000	6652000	and they would kick them off into the ocean or whatever that was supposed to be in the stage.
6652000	6654000	The abyss, yes.
6654000	6659000	So that's where the pipe stuff comes from, and I suppose in the context of those games,
6659000	6663000	I guess he was cleaning the sewers so that makes him a plumber? Okay.
6663000	6668000	Now before that he was in the business of being a kidnapper, or a donkey-napper, right?
6668000	6670000	Because didn't he...
6670000	6674000	No, in the first game he's trying to save the princess from Donkey Kong,
6674000	6678000	but in the second game Mario fucking kidnaps Donkey Kong.
6678000	6681000	Mario gets his fucking revenge, doesn't he?
6681000	6686000	So I was a little surprised that he ended up being Mario,
6686000	6689000	but also in those games that guy was Jumpman.
6689000	6691000	He wasn't Mario yet.
6691000	6698000	So once Mario became Mario in the original Mario Brothers, there was plumber context to it.
6698000	6701000	So why do we have to fucking have that confirmed?
6701000	6704000	That's what I don't understand. I'm not going to read that story,
6704000	6706000	but why do we have to have that confirmed?
6706000	6708000	When was this ever in any doubt that Mario was a plumber?
6708000	6712000	And to be fair to Redotainment's question, what does it fucking matter?
6712000	6714000	It kind of doesn't.
6714000	6718000	He's right. I suppose some people like to get into the story, though.
6718000	6722000	And you know, when the games used to come out on the NES, back in the day, Redotainment,
6722000	6726000	way back in the day, and you might be too young to remember this, I don't know how old you are.
6726000	6729000	Back in the day when we bought video games, they came with these things.
6729000	6731000	They're relics. They're called instruction manuals.
6731000	6733000	You remember those? Instruction manuals?
6733000	6736000	And sometimes those instruction manuals will tell a little story
6736000	6740000	about what's going on in the game, and they might even have art that's going on in the game.
6740000	6744000	Sometimes the art looked way better than the game itself,
6744000	6746000	such as the original Mega Man. No, I'm kidding.
6746000	6748000	But like the old Atari 2600 games, right?
6748000	6754000	Had pretty kick-ass box art, and then the games themselves looked like Blocky the Block, Blockerson.
6754000	6759000	So, what does it matter that he's a plumber?
6759000	6763000	Those little instruction manuals were a lot of fun.
6763000	6767000	People can have fun with their fan art on Reddit and stuff, but you're right.
6767000	6771000	You would think, after all this time, maybe he'd wield a pipe wrench or something.
6771000	6778000	But then we'd get in the Half-Life 3 rumors and we're not going to do that.
6778000	6785000	It's just like this, okay? It's like, you've got porn star Ron Jeremy,
6785000	6789000	and if Ron Jeremy decided to stop doing porn,
6789000	6794000	he's still going to be a fucking porn star because he's goddamn Ron Jeremy.
6794000	6799000	So, Mario is always going to be a plumber because that's the character that he was,
6799000	6803000	unless Mario's like, I fucking quit this plumbing job and I'm going to become...
6803000	6809000	I don't know. What the fuck ever he's going to become. A carpenter or something.
6809000	6812000	Okay, okay. Rama in chat says,
6812000	6818000	Rob Roberts, in the instruction manual for Super Mario Bros., Mario was listed as a citizen of the Mushroom Kingdom.
6818000	6822000	The plumber aspect came in for the Super Mario Bros. Super Show and the original Mario Bros.
6822000	6827000	Okay, but wait a minute. One of those things precedes the other by many years, okay?
6827000	6832000	The Super Mario Bros. Super Show was what, 88? I want to say it was like 4th grade or 5th grade that show was on.
6832000	6840000	The original Mario Bros. was like 83? 82 maybe? I'd have to look it up on the wiki.
6840000	6846000	The original Mario Bros. was definitely first before any of that stuff in the instruction manual or any of that.
6846000	6850000	And that's where the plumber shit was, the original Mario Bros., right?
6850000	6855000	I feel like we've spent way too much time on this topic.
6856000	6863000	Alright, thank you Tiger Claw confirms 1983. Alright, so be it. Let's move on.
6863000	6869000	That was it for emails. If you want to send us emails, participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to do it.
6869000	6873000	In the meantime, Loki is going to get to some more news.
6873000	6882000	Yes. So, this was unfortunate if you happen to be an owner of an Oculus Rift, but they released a patch that broke the Rift.
6882000	6888000	Actually, they didn't release the patch. They had an issue with a security certificate that had expired.
6888000	6893000	And so, because of that, it rendered all the headsets inoperable. That sucks.
6893000	6898000	But thankfully, though, they did eventually fix it with the manual patch.
6898000	6910000	And to apologize for the downtime, they did offer up anybody that had used their headset after February 1st would receive $15 in Oculus Store credit.
6912000	6922000	I don't know. I feel that you should, if you're releasing hardware that can be broken that easily by a security update or something like that, that there's a problem.
6922000	6925000	I don't think you would have this problem with the Vive.
6925000	6928000	The project manager left that off the spreadsheet, apparently.
6928000	6934000	I mean, I just, I just like, I still have a problem with the Oculus Store being like a closed system anyways.
6934000	6939000	But is it really closed, Loki?
6939000	6941000	It's still the principle of it.
6941000	6946000	I have a problem. I just feel that this was handled by Valve or something like that.
6946000	6949000	For one, it's not going to happen. This isn't going to happen.
6949000	6954000	And two, that there would be just easier workarounds to get it working type of thing.
6954000	6958000	It wouldn't be like, oh, well, we're fucked, you know, until they fix it.
6958000	6965000	I don't know. I just, I just think that there's more that they could have done to avoid this.
6965000	6974000	Well, this, this was a big deal that like anything remotely relating to, it wasn't just like people couldn't play games.
6974000	6983000	But like, if you had to like touch an Oculus, like you were running an arcade that charges people to play Oculus, you were down.
6983000	6986000	If you were making games for Oculus, you were down.
6986000	6992000	So this, this was something that, you know, this booboo affected everything, the whole system.
6993000	6994000	Yeah. Yeah.
6994000	7000000	And I would think that they would have, well, now they know that not to make this happen again.
7000000	7004000	So hopefully this can be avoided in the future.
7004000	7009000	So, you know, Bobby is saying his piece in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
7009000	7014000	Bobby Leckl says, yes, the Vive would have the same problem. This is a Microsoft requirement.
7014000	7019000	Even Apple OS has the same security requirement. This is a base level OS issue.
7019000	7022000	Yes, they could have kept their certificate up to date. You are correct.
7022000	7028000	But the HTC Vive has the exact same developer certificates that have expiration dates.
7028000	7032000	Some folks in chat bringing up potentially related circumstances.
7032000	7037000	RageNator saying years ago, wasn't there an issue of PlayStation Network or Xbox Live due to leap year?
7037000	7039000	And as such, the service went down.
7039000	7041000	Yep. That was PlayStation Network.
7041000	7042000	Yeah.
7043000	7045000	Because they can't calendar.
7046000	7051000	Well, sometimes when the odometer rolls over, it's like Gandhi and civilization.
7051000	7053000	Oh my God, it's Y2K.
7053000	7057000	Gandhi was supposed to be the most passive and not use the nukes.
7057000	7062000	But unfortunately, that modifier caused when it went negative, that number would go negative in certain difficulties.
7062000	7064000	That's not a bug anymore. That's a feature.
7064000	7069000	Yeah. And it rolled over into the highest positive possible and Gandhi would be the first to nuke your ass in civilization.
7069000	7070000	That's hilarious.
7070000	7074000	And still is. Now they've kind of embraced that. And like now they do that on purpose.
7075000	7076000	Basically.
7079000	7082000	But everything's fixed now, right?
7082000	7083000	Yes.
7083000	7084000	Alright.
7086000	7089000	Moving on to something about Zen Studios.
7089000	7095000	This is an interesting story because you don't hear usually about studios canceling patches.
7095000	7099000	And so the patch for Pinball FX3 was canceled.
7099000	7102000	Yeah. Zen Studios was going to do a patch for Pinball FX3.
7102000	7106000	And it was supposed to fix some framerate issues that the game has been having.
7106000	7108000	They've canceled the patch.
7108000	7111000	In an announcement, Zen Studios said on social media,
7111000	7115000	Hey guys, we might have been premature in the excitement surrounding the Switch release.
7115000	7120000	We really think this is one of the best platforms to play the game and wanted to make it to everyone's liking.
7120000	7126000	We've sat on this problem contemplating it for a long time trying to find a good way to up the frames per your request.
7127000	7130000	We found that there was no universal method to do this.
7130000	7133000	And each table would require a lot of separate work.
7133000	7138000	The volume in we don't have the bandwidth for the graphics and the QA department right now.
7138000	7142000	We really do apologize for us being a bit slow to properly address this.
7142000	7145000	P.S. check out Son of Zeus though.
7145000	7149000	We were able to better some of that table's problems in Camera 3 and 4.
7149000	7154000	So basically, they don't have the time or resources to do a patch to fix some of these framerate issues.
7154000	7161000	I've noticed some framerate stuff when I've played Pinball FX, but it's not like game killing or game murdering.
7161000	7166000	I just kind of went, Oh, I guess this is just one of the drawbacks of playing on the Switch,
7166000	7168000	is that once in a while I'm going to do a little like, huh?
7168000	7172000	But it's not that bad, if that makes sense.
7172000	7178000	Obviously it runs pretty smoothly flawlessly on my PC, and I don't necessarily have that same issue on my Switch.
7178000	7180000	That's the big difference.
7180000	7186000	It could be worse. You could roll out an anti-cheat patch for your game, like PUBG, and break everything,
7186000	7190000	and have all sorts of problems, and then have to backtrack that.
7190000	7192000	But still, it's kind of interesting to hear a developer acknowledge,
7192000	7197000	Yeah, there's some framerate issues, but you know what, we just don't have the resources to fix everything.
7197000	7202000	Maybe it's just because the Switch isn't the same hardware as the other stuff this game's running on,
7202000	7205000	so it's just one of those corners that's got to be cut.
7205000	7206000	Too bad.
7206000	7210000	I still like Pinball FX, so I don't want to be too harsh on the company.
7210000	7214000	I think this is just some of the reality of game development, is that I think a lot of us sit here and go,
7214000	7217000	Oh, they can always fix it with a patch. They can do that with a patch.
7217000	7220000	Well, you have to be able to pay the people to make the patch.
7220000	7226000	And if you don't have those types of resources, and you can't bring on those resources temporarily,
7226000	7230000	it's usually not something you want to do. It doesn't happen.
7230000	7233000	Or it could be even they've done it in the past where it's like,
7233000	7241000	We're going to spend, say, $100,000 to fix this via patch.
7241000	7247000	That's what it's going to cost to develop this, but we're only going to make $50,000 as a return on this.
7247000	7251000	Is it worth wasting $50,000 on?
7251000	7256000	That would depend on the size of your studio, and I don't think Zen Studios is that big of a company.
7256000	7260000	And are there that many people playing Zen Pinball on the Switch? I don't know.
7260000	7265000	I mean, the vertical mode is pretty awesome. If you haven't checked it out on the Switch, it's worth looking at.
7265000	7271000	And it could always be like they can't do it right now, but maybe later on when they have more resources to allocate to it, they could do it.
7271000	7277000	Or figure out what tables are the most popular and fix those first. I don't know.
7277000	7282000	Maybe that's why they did the Son of Zeus one, because that's the table a lot of people got for free,
7282000	7286000	because that week they released on the Switch, you could get that table for free.
7286000	7292000	I think everybody now, you can't get that one for free anymore, but I think Sorcerer's Apprentice is the free one.
7292000	7295000	So you get something for free.
7295000	7299000	So anyway, just a few more stories, then we're going to open up the Skype line.
7299000	7302000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, but first, Loki.
7302000	7306000	So this is actually pretty cool. I like the whole announcement they were showing off with this.
7306000	7311000	And I can't remember the last game. I think it was Far Cry 3 that they did on Editor 4.
7311000	7318000	Far Cry 5, they've got a new mode called Far Cry Arcade, and it's going to come with a map editor.
7318000	7323000	So people are going to be able to make their own custom maps for the game with different objects,
7323000	7326000	and create new levels, and maybe even game types out of it.
7326000	7330000	And of course, that's going to be pretty awesome.
7330000	7337000	So yeah, Far Cry, they said, I remember even the original Far Cry games had map editors as well.
7337000	7340000	The last one I remember playing with was Far Cry 2.
7340000	7343000	And I know that they had one with Far Cry Instincts as well on Xbox 360.
7343000	7345000	I remember playing with that as well.
7345000	7347000	But this looks really cool.
7347000	7351000	It wasn't really on my radar as a game. I kind of wanted to play.
7351000	7355000	But now that they mentioned this map editor and stuff, it kind of has me curious like,
7355000	7357000	hmm, that might be kind of fun to mess around with.
7357000	7361000	So it might actually get me the purchase of the game. We'll have to see.
7362000	7366000	Very cool. Yeah, so there's like 7,000 different objects in there.
7368000	7373000	And all these different user-created levels are going to be available, I guess, to play as you will.
7373000	7376000	And they're going to have different modes.
7378000	7383000	Yeah, I'm really interested. Check this out when they see how creative people can get with this stuff.
7384000	7387000	Very cool. And the game, of course, comes out on March 27th.
7387000	7390000	So I may have to pick this up.
7391000	7393000	Yeah, this sort of thing seems right up your alley.
7394000	7402000	This kind of reminds me a little bit of some of the crazy shit they can do with, you know, like...
7403000	7405000	Well, Bobby Black Wolf calls it Far Cry Mario Maker.
7406000	7411000	Sort of. Well, Far Cry, to be honest, they used to, this was part of the package with Far Cry.
7411000	7417000	It's like, okay, you'd have Far Cry, the single-player game, and then you'd have this map editor and you could play multiplayer and stuff.
7417000	7420000	And it was really cool. I remember playing with some of that stuff.
7421000	7426000	But it was kind of limited. This, they said that they're not only going to release this stuff, but they're going to keep updating it as well, adding new things to it.
7426000	7433000	So it kind of has that whole... what was their spin-off game? The Far Cry...
7435000	7437000	I don't remember now. But yeah, like the kind of the tongue-in-cheek...
7437000	7438000	Blood Dragon?
7438000	7441000	Blood Dragon, yes. It has the Far Cry, Blood Dragon kind of vibe to it.
7442000	7445000	Like the screenshot that they show here, there's like a, looks like a guy about to punch a bear.
7445000	7448000	That spin-off game did really, that Blood Dragon did really well, though, so I'm not...
7448000	7454000	Blood Dragon was a great game. It was just cheesy and weird, but I want more Blood Dragon.
7454000	7462000	Alright. Alright, and lastly tonight, you know, before we get to Skype calls over at Orange Laundry, all one word on Skype.
7462000	7465000	I know video games have been in the media a lot recently.
7465000	7469000	In fact, shut up. Don't spoil my story, you stupid auto-playing video.
7469000	7471000	I thought these things were supposed to be blocked in Chrome. Oh yeah.
7471000	7475000	I'm still on Windows XP on this computer, so Chrome is not actually blocking things.
7475000	7481000	Anyway, here's the deal. So, I know in the media a lot lately, we've heard about the video games.
7481000	7487000	Some people want to blame video games for causing all the violence and some of the serious problems we have in this country.
7487000	7492000	Which, to those of us that have been commentating on this stuff for over 15 years, it's like a broken record.
7492000	7497000	Well, it is a broken record. It's like the only question that killed that argument right there is,
7497000	7501000	do they have video games in the rest of the world? Yes. Then it's not the fucking factor.
7502000	7506000	Because we don't have this violence in other parts of the country where they have stricter gun laws.
7506000	7511000	They have the same access to these video games. So, that is fucking null void.
7511000	7515000	Let's get on to the real topic now. Kill the whole thing in like five minutes.
7515000	7521000	I know, I know. But yeah, there was that whole meeting that they had at the White House, which was totally one-sided.
7521000	7525000	Because he's a fucking dumbass. I know, I know. Anyway, that actually wasn't what I wanted to bring up,
7525000	7531000	but because that happened, a lot of the media is saying, is the president onto something with this?
7531000	7533000	Do video games cause violent behavior?
7533000	7538000	Do we not ask the same question about why the rest of the world doesn't have this problem even though they have video games?
7538000	7540000	Fuck no. Let's sensationalize.
7540000	7551000	A psychologist named Patrick Markey did some research on this and showed that 80% of mass shooters didn't even show an interest in violent video games.
7551000	7553000	In comments on this, Markey said,
7567000	7580000	Apparently, what's interesting about this, images of the rifle that were in the game Call of Duty are from a lawsuit that Sandy Hook parents who sued Remington said the company bears responsibility for the killings of the 26 children.
7580000	7589000	Because the guy who shot, I don't want to say his name because I don't want to make him famous, the guy who shot those poor children at the school used that type of gun to do it.
7589000	7596000	And so, in another comment here, one of the attorneys, Joss Koskoff, said,
7610000	7617000	So, they reached out for comment to somebody, I guess, that was in the Trump thing panel and didn't hear back on this.
7617000	7623000	The ESA has commented that numerous scientific studies show there is no connection between video games and violence.
7623000	7630000	And Markey actually says in his research, it shows that when a new violent video game is released, crime actually drops.
7630000	7638000	Because people might be taking out their frustrations on a video game, I would assume, or what's going on or something like that. I don't know.
7639000	7643000	You would think there's a lot of people out there who kill people in video games so they don't do it in real life.
7643000	7656000	It's dumb. To me, the connection between violent video games and people that shoot up other people is like saying, these people eat food.
7656000	7662000	Food causes murderers. That's about the same type of correlation that they could draw there.
7662000	7671000	But, once again, do they have food in other countries? Yes, they do. Do they have murder rates like we do? No, they don't. That's not the fucking reason.
7671000	7679000	Kaijuto in chat says they can make the argument that violent video games get censored in other countries more than this country, not Canada.
7679000	7683000	That would be my biggest thing to point at. Canada, though.
7684000	7691000	Anytime there's a problem about, you know, America. Canada, though. They're fine. Canada, though.
7691000	7698000	And I know what you're thinking about. You're thinking about how Australia has a more stringent thing where Mortal Kombat wasn't allowed there.
7698000	7706000	But they have that now, where they do have it. Australia also banned guns altogether. So, it's a little apples to oranges.
7707000	7711000	What about Japan? Yeah, great example.
7711000	7716000	Japan has, you know... The same games. The same games. And they have...
7716000	7725000	Sometimes, actually, it should be pointed out, sometimes, in the interest of all fairness, Japan does do some censorship in games.
7725000	7730000	And I'm thinking of Until Dawn, specifically. There was a scene in Until Dawn where it fades to black.
7730000	7736000	And you hear the screaming. You didn't actually see it. And I think it's the scene where, spoiler alert, somebody gets cut in half.
7737000	7744000	Or did they? Ha ha ha. So, that scene, I do not believe, actually exists in the Japanese version of the game.
7744000	7749000	So, there is some censorship that happens. But, Canada, though.
7749000	7756000	I doubt that one scene in one game is gonna cause that much of a difference. Like, oh, I didn't see that guy cut in half.
7756000	7760000	I guess I'm not a murderer now.
7760000	7765000	ActDeaf says, Japan has a strict policy on gore, though, like no dismemberment.
7765000	7771000	And AkumaJP, who would have some authority on what happens in Japan, says, we do not have guns here.
7771000	7778000	And movies had no violence. Yeah, and AkumaJP brings up a point on the movies, which I always kind of go,
7778000	7785000	why are we picking on games when movies are just as easily accessible and show pretty much all the same things, if not worse?
7785000	7789000	Like, I understand there's something to be said about, oh, well, you take control in the games or whatever.
7789000	7793000	But you're still playing, nine times out of ten, some type of story, some type of narrative.
7793000	7800000	And the imagery, which is so terrible, is the same imagery they show in movies.
7800000	7809000	And, again, Canada doesn't seem to have this problem. Canada also has a really diverse, like, political, like,
7809000	7815000	if you look at the equivalent of the cabinet for the president here, what would be the equivalent in Canada there?
7815000	7818000	It's, like, really fucking diverse. It's so interesting.
7818000	7824000	Exactly, exactly. And it's just like you have a bunch of old people in the fucking Congress and shit that
7824000	7833000	don't have any fucking clue what's in actual video games and are making decisions based on what somebody tells them might be the reason.
7833000	7835000	I mean, it's just like, I'm sure...
7835000	7841000	I just, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just cannot believe that, you know, the guy that supposedly runs this company
7841000	7849000	had that meeting so one-sided where, like, people were there who have not made or influenced a video game in their fucking life.
7849000	7859000	And their money is made off of books written to bash video games that are sold to a core audience that believes this shit.
7859000	7861000	Like, it's just, it blows my mind.
7861000	7863000	I'll tell you exactly how it works.
7863000	7869000	They were there for profits. They were in this meeting for profits for themselves that have nothing to do with making...
7869000	7879000	It's because some dude went on Fox News to blame somebody else other than the guns because they're in the pocket of the NRA and so what happened there?
7879000	7886000	Trump saw that and because Fox News basically tells him what to think, he's like, oh shit, it must be the fucking video games.
7886000	7895000	And because he's a clueless idiot, he decided that we better have a meeting about this instead of fucking gun violence and about what laws we can do to stop that.
7895000	7901000	And that's why we wasted this time with this circle jerk of a thing that is just not gonna go anywhere.
7901000	7903000	I mean, the guy's so fucking clueless.
7903000	7906000	Dude, we need to have a rating system for movies, he said.
7906000	7910000	Do you not fucking know about the MPAA that's been around since fucking ever?
7910000	7913000	I mean, like, are you that fucking stupid?
7913000	7918000	Here's the most basic thing. Again, I'm not trying to get political, I'm not, but I can't fucking help it.
7918000	7925000	Especially, you know what, you might think this political rant is not gaming related, but look what just happened in Washington this week.
7925000	7930000	Like, you know, that types of conversation leads to, should we ban video games?
7930000	7936000	You know, I don't think legally they can. The Supreme Court's set a precedent on that with the whole, you know, what happened here in California.
7936000	7940000	However, yes, it does tie to video games. So if you think this shit doesn't affect you, like, wake up.
7940000	7947000	And what blows my fucking mind about this is that, you know, I realize gun control and this stuff is a passionate issue for people.
7947000	7951000	But I kind of thought, I thought we hit an agreement on all sides.
7951000	7952000	We settled this back in the 90s.
7952000	7957000	I thought we hit an agreement on all sides. Democrat, Republican, the folks.
7957000	7962000	I thought everybody hit this consensus that no one needs a bump stock.
7962000	7968000	Like, I thought we've, I thought we've reached that. Like, everybody agreed on that at some point, right?
7968000	7972000	Except the NRA. But the NRA is there to sell more.
7972000	7976000	They are an organization that tries to sell more guns and sell things like that.
7976000	7979000	So, of course, they're not going to be for banning the bump stock because they want to keep selling them.
7979000	7980000	So fuck the NRA.
7980000	7987000	So, but my understanding is both Democrats and Republicans all agree bump stocks aren't needed, right?
7987000	7995000	So why haven't we still said they should stop, they should stop selling bump stocks?
7995000	7997000	Why? Why is it still?
7997000	7998000	It's because...
7998000	8000000	How many months has it been since Vegas?
8000000	8001000	It's because a lot of the...
8001000	8002000	It's still...
8002000	8006000	Because politicians like being career politicians.
8006000	8009000	And in order to be a politician, they have to have money to run their campaigns.
8009000	8011000	Where they get this money from? The NRA.
8011000	8023000	Please, please, please vote and throw these fuckers who can't do shit out of office.
8023000	8031000	Anyway, sorry. Thank you for the hug.
8031000	8033000	Go over and chat at live.vognetwork.com.
8033000	8037000	We're going to open up the Skype line.
8037000	8038000	I'm sure some of you want to comment on this.
8038000	8040000	Or really something else would be okay too.
8040000	8042000	If you want to comment on something else, that is completely okay.
8042000	8046000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.
8046000	8051000	Or you can, of course, call us on the old school phone, 1-877-GAMO-LR.
8052000	8056000	Let's see. I'm going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
8056000	8061000	I guess the good old lawyer, Jack Voldemort, as we call him here on the show,
8061000	8065000	tried to inject himself into that White House debate.
8065000	8067000	I had read that too, S. Jonah and Matt.
8067000	8070000	I read that somewhere that he was trying to get in on that.
8070000	8072000	I don't know if that was like an onion satire thing or if that's...
8072000	8077000	But I would think that guy is so fucking irrelevant that this is one of those things that he could probably cling to.
8077000	8079000	Like, oh, I fought these video game industry people for years.
8079000	8081000	Have a seat, bitch!
8084000	8086000	And that's my message to Jack Voldemort.
8089000	8092000	Let's see. Also in chat at live.vognetwork.com.
8092000	8097000	Act F says, can you remember the call a while ago about Mexico doing a rating system?
8097000	8099000	This pretty much feels like it.
8099000	8101000	And we have a gun ban too.
8103000	8105000	Let's see. Akuma JP says, vote.
8105000	8108000	If Trump can happen, I don't believe in vote no more.
8108000	8113000	Akuma JP, look at how many people voted and where.
8113000	8116000	And that's why things happen that surprise people.
8117000	8120000	And Dungeon Muster also points out the Electoral College voted him in.
8120000	8125000	Not necessarily the popular vote. That's a very interesting perspective on that as well.
8125000	8127000	Yeah, well, one battle at a time.
8127000	8129000	All right. Anyhow, let's get to the calls.
8129000	8131000	Maybe our caller has something else and gets us off the political stuff.
8131000	8133000	Hi, you're on Orange Mountains Radio. Who's this?
8133000	8135000	Hey, this is Regineer.
8135000	8137000	Hey, Regineer. What's on your mind, buddy?
8137000	8143000	Well, two topics. I'll make my original topic the second one.
8143000	8148000	Your discussion kind of takes a little precedence.
8148000	8150000	I think it's a little bit more important.
8151000	8162000	My local CBS affiliate ran a story on the video game topic just the other day.
8162000	8170000	In fact, I ended up contacting via Facebook with the response pretty much two cents in.
8170000	8180000	And, you know, I basically said so many words to them that, you know,
8180000	8188000	they're just, you know, the politicians and what they are just using video games is a convenient scapegoat.
8188000	8195000	If you think about, you know, violence in media is nothing new.
8195000	8204000	You know, we had violence in movies and TV, case in point, the Godfather movies,
8204000	8211000	the old westerns from the 50s and 60s where there were shootouts left and right.
8212000	8216000	And I can go on and on and on.
8216000	8220000	An orgy of violence has been in this culture forever, yes.
8220000	8227000	Yeah, even in literature, has anyone ever read Shakespeare?
8227000	8231000	Hello, Othello, Hamlet, everyone dies.
8231000	8234000	You know what else is kind of violent?
8234000	8237000	And again, I'm going to open a huge can of worms with this, so I'm really just going to leave it at this.
8237000	8242000	But like, some of the Bible is pretty violent, too. I'm just saying.
8242000	8251000	I just noticed some of the things they teach us with are not always the kindest and sunshine and rainbows types of stories.
8251000	8256000	And I'm just gonna leave it at that. I know that's very controversial, but I mean, I don't think I'm saying anything wrong.
8256000	8259000	Some of the stories in the Bible are pretty brutal.
8259000	8272000	Now, here's a rhetorical question. Have you ever heard of an instance where someone had read Hamlet and decided to go on a shooting spree?
8272000	8275000	I sure as hell haven't.
8275000	8278000	I don't think anyone got shot in Hamlet.
8279000	8294000	Well, the point being, you know, no one's not now read those plays and what that decide to murder people or anything like that or read Romeo and Juliet decided to commit suicide.
8294000	8296000	I mean, you know.
8297000	8310000	Now, the difference, the only difference that comes to mind between video games and these other forms of media is that video games, relatively speaking, is still relatively new.
8310000	8317000	Video games, commercially speaking, have already been around since, what, 1971, 1972, thereabouts?
8317000	8329000	And also, generally speaking, generationally speaking, who's in power right now? Baby boomers, right?
8329000	8339000	By the time video games start coming around with Space Warrior and Pong and all that, these baby boomers were already adults.
8339000	8345000	They weren't exposed to video games when they were kids like us.
8345000	8351000	Here's what it is. Here's what it is, Raginator. I appreciate your points, but I'm going to break it down real quick.
8351000	8360000	Here's the deal, is that, you know, in our culture, we want to blame somebody else and accept no personal responsibility for some of the things that happen.
8360000	8368000	And, you know, right now it's blame the video games. And there was a time and place when people wanted to ban books. I mean, they still do.
8368000	8374000	You know, books like Catcher in the Rye and shit, like people, and there's been commentary that's been done on this.
8374000	8379000	Like the book Fahrenheit 451 kind of takes the whole book burning thing and does the whole thing with it.
8379000	8383000	So our culture has always been obsessed with blaming something else besides ourselves.
8383000	8393000	But the reality is, and well, at least my reality and the way I view all this stuff is, and I'm pretty sure most people would agree with me on this.
8393000	8400000	Everybody's got this little thing inside, this little switch inside them. And most people, I think, would call it a moral compass.
8400000	8407000	And that moral compass tells you what's right and wrong. And, you know, like most things in the world, it's a little bit of a spectrum, right?
8407000	8413000	Some people are always going to adhere to that moral compass. They're not going to break any rule. They're not going to do anything that, you know, breaks that moral compass.
8413000	8419000	They're not going to have sex before marriage and they're not going to, you know, whatever their religion tells them, they're not going to violate any of that stuff.
8419000	8425000	They're going to adhere to that moral compass, you know, strictly. Some people, it's a little more of a gray.
8425000	8432000	Oh, I fucking jaywalked it. Oh, I said the F word, whatever. But at the end of the day, I like to think I'm a pretty good person.
8432000	8441000	And that moral, that moral compass and so forth. There's also a little part of that switch is the little switch that's like, is it a good idea to murder somebody?
8441000	8449000	Like actually murder or let's just say hurt somebody. Is it a good idea to physically harm another human being?
8449000	8454000	And the good news is, Rage Nator, I think for most of us, that switch is in the no position.
8454000	8468000	But unfortunately for some folks, and that ain't the video game fault, that ain't the movie's fault, that ain't anybody's fault, but the person who chooses to hurt another human being.
8468000	8478000	Exactly. And not only that, but to touch on a point that was being made earlier, video games have ratings on them.
8478000	8486000	You know, they've had ratings since the early to mid 90s. You know, they have the call ESRB ratings going on.
8486000	8506000	And every package since then, the rating on the front, clear as day and descriptors on the back, tell you exactly why that game has that such and such rating.
8506000	8526000	And to the best of my knowledge, no store, including GameStop, will sell an M rated game to a kid unless the parent is physically there.
8526000	8539000	And then the employee will tell the parent what the rating of the game is and why the game has a rating.
8539000	8548000	Well, Rage Nator, GameStop does indeed have that policy in place that they don't sell M rated games to kids.
8548000	8556000	But some of the employees at GameStop, their moral compass might tell them, eh, fuck this place. I'm just here because I need a job.
8556000	8564000	Get the hell out of here, kid. It's the only way I'm going to get rid of you to sell you this game. Give me your money and get the fuck out of here.
8564000	8582000	Yeah, you know, I think, you know, both you and Loki had not necessarily tonight, but have coming in shows past where, you know, sometimes, you know, you know, a parent could be at a store with their kid.
8582000	8594000	And, you know, let's call the kid Little Johnny and, you know, Little Johnny will say to mom, hey, I want this new GTA game.
8594000	8602000	You know, they'll, you know, take, you know, the game to the counter. You know, the employees say, hey, this game is rated out for mature.
8602000	8613000	This is why, you know, why is rated that way? And the perils say something to affect. I don't give a shit. I want my kid wants this game. He won't shut up until he gets it.
8613000	8623000	That's all that is. Yeah, absolutely. And that is between the parent and the kid. And then if that kid goes and does something, I bet that parent is going to be the first one to blame everything else.
8624000	8641000	Yeah. And then, you know, I think also, you know, if I remember right now, correct me if I'm wrong, but, you know, something was said after that, you know, where they, you know, we're coming back, you know, hours later or days later or whatever,
8641000	8654000	with the game toast, you want to make a return and say, oh, my God, this game has this, this and this in it. I want a refund. How could you sell this to my kid?
8654000	8662000	As an old boss of mine said, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.
8662000	8669000	Well, enough of my original, you know, this topic. I want to get to the my second one before you close out.
8669000	8676000	I'm actually going to go ahead and let you go. We're already up on ten minutes on this call. I got to give time for others to get through. But feel free to send us an email. Okay.
8676000	8683000	Sure. Sounds good. All right. Take care, buddy. All right. One eight seven seven game all our username on Skype, which is the way most people do it.
8683000	8690000	Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call and talk about anything that's going on in the news this week. In fact, there it is.
8690000	8696000	Lighten up. I knew we'd have more calls coming in. That's why I had to let poor Reginator go. But hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8696000	8698000	Hey, this is Act Deaf.
8698000	8699000	Hey, Act Deaf. What's on your mind, buddy?
8699000	8703000	Well, pretty much continuing what the topic is right now.
8703000	8706000	That's all right. We brought it up. So let's talk about it. What's on your mind?
8706000	8709000	Yeah, it needs to be discussed.
8709000	8713000	But you're not in America. So you may have a different perspective on all this.
8714000	8736000	And there's exactly a different perspective because we also have people down here like they say, oh, video games are bad for you. Like I was saying in my one of my calls previously that they want to do a rating system down here because, oh, well, children are getting influenced by video games and they're bad because they make them violent.
8737000	8754000	Can I jump in here real quick? Because I mean, I want to ask you this because and I know you're just one person in a very big country. But can I tell you that the perception of many Americans, the perception of many, many Americans is that Mexico is a more dangerous place than the U.S.
8754000	8768000	And that Mexico has these drug cartels that behead people. And for that reason, we don't vacation at what is that play Playa del Carmen or whatever is that place that they told people not to go to just this last week?
8768000	8791000	Yeah, I think it's Playa del Carmen. And I'm not going to lie, Mexico is a dangerous place. And I do see like in newspapers, news sites over here that, oh, people got beheaded or someone in the cartel got caught and many are dead.
8792000	8810000	And it's like daily basis. But it's pretty much contained if something and only in certain areas, like if and especially like where I live. And it's next to the border. So it's like really close to the United States.
8811000	8829000	You can see like people like getting assassinated or getting killed every day. But in comparison even to like this year in the United States, the United States has had way more killings than we do.
8829000	8857000	And just my hometown, it's crazy. It's like, wow, I don't understand. And going to the video game thing, I have to thank video games for like teaching me how to read Spanish, learn English and speak English, write in English. I have a lot to thank video games for.
8857000	8873000	I think if I worked with video games, I wouldn't be like right here right now talking to you. I wouldn't have a job because because of video games, I learned English and I teach English for a living. So yeah, I don't know how exactly how
8873000	8886000	that's a great point. That's a great point is that we oftentimes neglect all the great things that video game has brought our culture because I firmly believe this video games are art and art enhances culture.
8886000	8895000	And some of us, you know, we have been I have met you act after you've been a great listener and support for many, many years because we're both kind of into video games.
8895000	8909000	And you're right, without video games, I probably wouldn't know who you are at all in this life. And video games have brought that together. And just like the video games have brought together people, couples that met playing World of Warcraft and going on adventures together
8909000	8920000	and deciding, hey, we should like go on a date offline and see what happens. And then they get married and have World of Warcraft babies like video games have had that impact on our culture.
8920000	8933000	And a lot of that is pretty amazing. And you're right, video games can also be used to teach. Video games have been used to teach for many years. We always, always on this show talk about the Oregon Trail and Number Munchers.
8933000	8945000	Like these were games that fucking impacted us big time as we were growing up, you know, and like like kids that are Loki's kids age are going to think that way about Minecraft and the stuff that they're learning on now.
8946000	8959000	And it's all because of parenting. It has to be good parenting. Every good teaching, and I know this because, again, I'm a teacher, comes from home. You can go to school, you can learn a lot of stuff.
8960000	8972000	And even like right now with all the teaching methods that exist right now, all good teaching comes from home. All good manners, all the good stuff has to come from home.
8972000	8999000	So if anybody doesn't have that, of course, they're going to go berserk or going to do crazy things. It's like basic principles. And again, it's like baffling to see many people blaming other stuff for especially video games or any media in general, blaming people or reining, oh, it's because of this. No, it's not.
8999000	9010000	So you're basically saying some of that moral compass I brought up earlier, a lot of a lot of that is shaped and and and made and melded while you're growing up in your home.
9010000	9013000	Exactly. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
9013000	9018000	All right. I'm gonna let you go to try to get more calls, but I really appreciate your perspective on this.
9018000	9019000	One more thing.
9019000	9020000	Yeah, of course.
9020000	9022000	People need more curvy. That's it.
9022000	9024000	Well, we'll all have the chance next week.
9024000	9025000	Yeah.
9025000	9026000	All right. Take care, my friend.
9026000	9027000	Thanks for having me.
9027000	9028000	Bye.
9028000	9031000	All right. One more call and we're going to call it a night.
9031000	9034000	Hello. You're on Orange on Radio. Who's this?
9034000	9035000	It's Rama.
9035000	9037000	Hey, Rama. How you doing, my friend?
9037000	9043000	I'm doing good. I mean, I had to jump in on this.
9043000	9048000	Now, I want you to know I have been listening to this show for a long time.
9048000	9051000	You have been listening to show for a long time, and I appreciate.
9051000	9060000	I was just thinking my trip to New York when I met you and SSG100Matt and like people that I don't even think listen to this show anymore, like Sephiroth1215 and stuff.
9060000	9062000	That was ten years ago.
9062000	9063000	Yes.
9063000	9064000	Ten years ago.
9064000	9070000	And I've called in and I've said this before.
9070000	9077000	OLR is more than just a show about at first DDR and now games.
9077000	9080000	Yeah, it's a show about food and dieting.
9080000	9082000	Weren't you listening earlier?
9082000	9088000	Well, I kind of missed the first part because I was underground because Signal kind of sucks when you're on an underground train, you know?
9088000	9097000	Oh, and real quick, I am told by SSG100Matt that Sephiroth1215 still listens via podcast. Well, shout out. Thanks for your support as well.
9097000	9098000	That is awesome.
9098000	9099000	That is awesome.
9100000	9108000	And there have been many times you have brought up non-gaming topics that we have all said it's political, but it's not.
9108000	9114000	Because it's stuff that has to be discussed because it impacts our hobbies and what we do.
9114000	9115000	Yes.
9115000	9125000	And this whole video game violence thing, I'm just like, whatever he is smoking, that's a strain that I don't want because I know it'll screw me up.
9125000	9127000	I will say this about video games.
9127000	9142000	If it wasn't for me having my first computer at the age of four, which led me to the Atari, Nintendo, and so forth, I probably would not be this nut about hardware and technology doing IT support.
9142000	9145000	I might be doing something else. Who knows?
9146000	9156000	When I was living with my god sister for about two years and my nephew, he would sit there and play GTA 3 all the time and he freaking loved it.
9156000	9160000	But mind you, the kid at the time was 12, 13.
9160000	9168000	But he knew that this was fantasy and you can't go out and walk up to somebody's car, throw them out, take the car and drive off.
9168000	9170000	It doesn't work that way.
9170000	9174000	That's something that my god sister instilled in him.
9174000	9177000	That's something that I instilled in him.
9177000	9186000	And let me tell you, when I was in the Marines, when we had downtime, we would be sitting there playing Battlefield, Call of Duty, this and that.
9186000	9189000	Yes, we know it's a fantasy fun game, but it was for shits and giggles.
9189000	9192000	There were guys I knew who were actually out in the front lines.
9192000	9193000	What were they doing on downtime?
9193000	9196000	Playing Call of Duty, playing Battlefield, Street Fighter.
9196000	9198000	It was just fun and games.
9198000	9199000	Yeah.
9199000	9202000	I just have to say, it goes back to the home.
9202000	9203000	I'm sorry.
9203000	9216000	If your kid is coming out saying that, if your kid is playing video games and thinks this is how it works in real life, you need to sit down with your child one on one and tell them this is fantasy.
9216000	9222000	If the teachers are telling your child that it doesn't work that way, do not blame the teacher.
9222000	9224000	It comes from the home.
9225000	9234000	I don't want to put myself out there, but I grew up in that neighborhood where the name of the game was Duck and Cover.
9234000	9237000	Because if you didn't duck and cover, you would catch a bullet in your head.
9237000	9240000	Because it could have been a stray bullet. Who knows?
9240000	9248000	Video games gave me that outlet where I wasn't allowed to go outside and play.
9248000	9250000	Because God forbid, I went outside and played with my friends.
9250000	9253000	Someone would get shot and I would be that person.
9253000	9260000	So my great grandmother, Lord rest her soul, got me a Nintendo and said, I will get you whatever games you want.
9260000	9262000	I just don't want you outside.
9262000	9267000	Yes, as I got older and I understood what was going on, I went out and did what I had to do.
9267000	9272000	But growing up, I was at home in front of my TV playing Super Mario Brothers 3, you know?
9274000	9278000	So I'm only not talking because I'm so captivated by your story right now.
9278000	9282000	Because it's heavy. It's heavy, Rama.
9282000	9292000	This is a story that people out there who are writing books to profit off of the negativity that they put out there about video games.
9292000	9297000	This is a story that they need to hear. Video games have fucking saved a lot of people.
9298000	9301000	Yeah, I don't mean to sound heavy.
9301000	9305000	It's fucking honest, Rama. It's honest.
9305000	9313000	And I appreciate that. And you're given a perspective here that not a lot of people have had or are going to...
9313000	9318000	Your reality is no one else's reality, if that makes sense.
9318000	9322000	Just like my reality is not your reality and all that stuff, you know what I mean?
9322000	9329000	Yeah, I get that. When the time comes when I have kids, they're going to play the same games that I did.
9329000	9336000	And they're going to know, you cannot do this in real life. Because if you do, it ain't the police you gotta worry about.
9336000	9345000	It's me you have to worry about. Because it's going to be a punishment and discipline that I realize I might or might not have failed as a parent.
9345000	9347000	But that means I have to do better.
9347000	9352000	I believe the line you're looking for is, I brought you into this world and I will take you out.
9353000	9356000	If I had a nickel for every time I heard that growing up.
9357000	9363000	Lord, I used to say for a while, if you look up ass-whooping in the dictionary, you see a picture of my sorry face.
9363000	9374000	Mm-hmm. No, I hear you. It was different in my household. It wasn't necessarily like physical violence, but it was a lot more like mental anguish.
9375000	9382000	Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Give me a reason to come in there or something like that. Yeah, I got that. Believe you me.
9382000	9383000	Mm-hmm.
9383000	9392000	I mean, honestly, video games is just an outlet to get away from the bullshit that is day in and day out life.
9392000	9399000	Whether you are a student in regular school and you're tired of this and that, you don't want to do your homework.
9399000	9404000	Whether you are a college student and you're trying to get yourself some free time.
9404000	9409000	Whether you are an adult and you're like, you know what, my boss just got on my last nerve, so you know what?
9409000	9414000	I'm going to sit right here, play some Final Fantasy XIV with my squad and have a good time.
9417000	9424000	And as realistic as the games can get, we just got to remember, it's just plain fun.
9425000	9431000	At that point where you're walking up into the bodega, holding out a thing of gold, saying you want this.
9431000	9436000	I got to tell you, we need to pull you aside. We need to sit down and have a good talk.
9438000	9439000	Absolutely.
9439000	9440000	Yeah.
9440000	9444000	Rama, thank you so much for the call and the perspective. I appreciate it.
9444000	9448000	And it's just, it's one of those things I think we all know it.
9448000	9452000	If you're here listening to Orange Launch Radio because you enjoy video games that much.
9452000	9456000	That you're seeking out a podcast where people talk about video. We're not even playing them.
9456000	9459000	We're not even Twitch. We're not playing them right now. That's what you see on Twitch.
9459000	9460000	We're just talking about them.
9460000	9464000	If you're out there and you seek out a podcast where people just talk about video games.
9464000	9468000	Like you clearly feel some of this too, that we have.
9468000	9471000	And video games probably helped you out in some way as well.
9471000	9476000	And so that's why I think a lot of us get really angry when we see our industry get scapegoated.
9476000	9480000	For, you know, some of this like bullshit that we don't want to be associated.
9480000	9486000	In fact, video games are the thing that we took to to escape some of that bullshit.
9486000	9490000	So y'all are passionate and I get it.
9490000	9495000	I'll say two more things. I'm going to get up on out here because we know there's going to be one more person that's got to say this.
9496000	9499000	Like, number one.
9499000	9505000	Like I said, I don't don't thank me. Don't think Raginator. Don't think Act F.
9505000	9513000	We thank you because these topics is what separates OLR from other gaming podcasts.
9513000	9516000	It's a bit of real life coming in.
9516000	9521000	And you've got to understand if we don't talk about what goes on in real life.
9521000	9525000	Real life, it can affect your hobbies as a whole.
9525000	9527000	You can't just ignore that.
9527000	9529000	And number two.
9529000	9532000	I really, really appreciate that.
9532000	9537000	I do feel other podcasts address real life issues in their own way.
9537000	9539000	But every dinner table is different.
9539000	9542000	And, you know, this I wouldn't have it any other way here.
9542000	9544000	And I appreciate you.
9544000	9546000	You know, we don't I say I say this every week.
9546000	9552000	You know, we don't have the audience that giant bomb cast or I don't even know who the other big players are anymore.
9552000	9556000	IGN. I'm not saying we don't have the numbers of the one up show.
9556000	9559000	And I'm oh, wait, that's website. I've been around for like 12 years.
9559000	9563000	Maybe we do have maybe we actually maybe we do have those numbers.
9563000	9571000	Just, you know, somewhere in storage when when they had like this, some gaming convention here in New York City years ago, I one up was there.
9571000	9575000	There was a pic. I have like a little one up ID badge card of me cosplaying kills.
9575000	9578000	It's somewhere in my storage. OK, yeah.
9578000	9582000	No, I remember how I see that and.
9582000	9589000	Whatever those big I look at this with the big gaming podcast, that's like having a ticket to see.
9589000	9598000	Share. Well, you know, someday, someday we might become the number one radio or podcast in Sacramento.
9598000	9602000	Sacramento. But unfortunately, unfortunately, that space is taken at this time.
9602000	9607000	Yeah, no, I don't make claim. It happens. No, I totally get I totally get it.
9607000	9616000	Like giant bomb cast. That's like share. We're like that underground thing that somebody wrote a zine about.
9616000	9621000	Yeah, you're you're you're like like mega ran in the crew at this local spot.
9621000	9625000	And when you that is a fucking compliment. Mega ran is fucking amazing.
9625000	9629000	I will take that compliment and hug it, except no one knows us like mega ran.
9629000	9633000	So that's true. He's a mega. Randy is more popular, but that's all right. It's fine.
9633000	9637000	It's like Rob opens up the curtain and expect to see one.
9637000	9642000	You know, there's like a hundred of us just chillin, just waiting for y'all to perform.
9642000	9647000	After the show, it's like Rob will sit, sit on the edge of the stage.
9647000	9652000	Let me tell you some real shit right now. And it's it's like MTV unplugged in a way.
9652000	9657000	It's like you're getting real at the words. It's like you're hanging out at the merchant table.
9657000	9661000	We're buying and you're just talking to us like we bros.
9661000	9667000	That's the best way I can I do. And this is that's part of the reason why I come in and do my best to listen.
9667000	9675000	Whether I am at my studio here listening while editing photos or I'm coming back from hanging out with my squad in Jersey for a convention.
9675000	9680000	As soon as I get uptown, I fire up TuneIn Radio to listen in to see what's going on.
9680000	9691000	Or if I know I'm going to be out and I can't be back in time, I'll message Dark Soccer about, you know, for the classic game so I can have it ready when I go home and do it.
9691000	9698000	And when it comes to games, if it wasn't for me being enjoying video games, I never would have discovered Ronma one half hard battle.
9698000	9703000	I never would have found the American version. I never would have gotten into the anime cosplay.
9703000	9707000	And I never would have been listed as a as a Ronma super fan.
9707000	9721000	And I'm on the Blu-rays and I never would have gotten so many friends and many fandoms.
9721000	9727000	And. God damn it, Ron, you're making me cry.
9727000	9730000	I didn't I didn't say a goddamn thing, Ronma.
9730000	9734000	But I feel I know I feel you. I feel you so hard right now, Ronma.
9734000	9752000	And I understand because like sometimes I think without gaming culture, without like the Internet and what I've been like, I sometimes feel like without like getting introduced to technology and that culture like Ronma, I would probably have a wife.
9752000	9764000	In a house like and think what I mean when I'm saying that I would probably have a wife and heaven forbid kids in a house somewhere in like Connecticut.
9764000	9773000	And like my wife would be so unhappy in this marriage that she'd be buying a PlayStation five to fuck her.
9773000	9781000	So I had to bring it full circle somehow. But there is no there is a serious point that there's absolutely serious point to that is that I oh my God.
9781000	9786000	Like me too. Yo, the video games helped me in a big way.
9786000	9792000	And I just I wish those stuffy old coots up in the White House would realize that as well.
9792000	9803000	Yeah. And it's like I said on like in a chat room a couple of weeks ago, I know people are shitting on Secret of Mana, but Secret of Mana got me through a really tough time in my teenage years.
9803000	9815000	And no matter how people are going to shit on it, if I can get myself a SNES classic, just remember this is this this is where I was trying to deal with my teenage angst or I pick it up.
9815000	9823000	And then when I get my PS4 and I sit there and I shed a tear remembering this is the game that got me through one of the toughest times in my life.
9823000	9833000	And you know what? And that's that's why when people like to talk about like these horrible video games and things that, you know, well, it's just like how how Dark Sakura and myself and even Loki a little bit.
9833000	9837000	We always stick up for the guardian legend, even though it's an NES game that people don't remember.
9837000	9847000	Like you got memories tied to things sometimes and you're going to defend that game till the fucking last day because it helps shape who you are.
9847000	9852000	And when somebody attacks it, it's attacking who you are.
9852000	9859000	It's kind of like, you know, on a related but oddly similar note, oddly, oddly similar note.
9859000	9865000	It's like when people attack the Rocky Horror Picture Show and that whole community, because you all know that's been a big part of my life, too.
9865000	9870000	And I've been doing that on and off for many years. And I have a lot to thank that community for as well.
9870000	9874000	And I mean, like it doesn't really have shit to do with the movie, the movie.
9874000	9879000	It's a bad movie, but it's the community saved my life.
9879000	9883000	Like I can literally say that community saved my fucking life.
9883000	9889000	And without, you know, that community, I would have met Travis who would have podcasting with me and all that other stuff.
9889000	9899000	So anyway, not to get on a tangent, but like when I see people like attacking that community or like these like Tumblr brats who talk about like all the problematic shit and stuff.
9899000	9904000	I'm like who haven't even gone and experienced it for themselves. I get really irritated.
9904000	9917000	You, you, when it comes to those goddamn Tumblr rights and my fandoms and cosplaying this and that, the old guard, we just want to sit there, gear up, take them out.
9917000	9925000	I'm like, nope, nope, nope. We should get up in the stands, stay up in the cheerleading section, balcony, whatever. Just eat our chips.
9925000	9932000	Watch the Tumblr likes destroy what we create. Then we come back downstairs and be like, you wrecked it. Now will you listen to us?
9932000	9938000	Here's the thing. I think you can challenge things and make it better. I think you can do that.
9938000	9941000	But a lot of it is in how do you deliver that message?
9941000	9945000	Like, you know, again, I'll go back to Rocky with one thing is I was fortunate enough.
9945000	9959000	Like I've kind of like I made it with that where I got to host a panel at a local convention here that actually had three of the actors from the movie, including Barry Boswick, who's prolific with a lot of other things he's done.
9959000	9965000	By the way, actually, I get to do it again on April 20th. We're actually doing Rocky Horror here in Sacramento live with Barry Boswick.
9965000	9972000	So cheap plug. But anyway, I've been fortunate enough to do a panel with him and the actress, Patricia Quinn, Magenta and now Campbell, who played Columbia.
9972000	9980000	And one of the things that came up at the panel, the reason why I bring this up is, you know, they were asked, is there something they don't like about what this turned into?
9980000	9985000	Is there something they don't like? And something they kind of said is that, you know, well, we've kind of seen some of the midnight screenings and things.
9985000	9992000	It feels like some people are just trying to be there to swear as much as possible and say fuck and interject their stuff as much as possible.
9992000	9998000	We just kind of wish, like, it would be, you know, like the callbacks, like, of course those are going to happen, but they should be smarter.
9998000	10006000	And I know after I heard them say that, I was like, you know, they're right. Like, this shouldn't be a contest about yelling as many incoherent lines as possible.
10006000	10013000	Like, it should be like any good joke. Like, hit them hard and hit them heavy with a real good joke.
10013000	10017000	But then you just back off for a little while until you have another real good joke. You know what I mean?
10017000	10024000	So my point with that is, ever since then, I've really kind of went with Rocky to just, I don't necessarily have to yell something at every part.
10024000	10029000	But I'm going to just yell like the 20 funniest things I know when the movie's going on, if that makes sense.
10029000	10031000	Yeah, it actually does.
10031000	10038000	So anyway, Rama, I cut Rage Nator off after 10 minutes and here we are going on 15.
10038000	10045000	But your call was awesome. Of course, all the calls we get here are awesome, but I really appreciate you and your perspective.
10045000	10052000	And I can't thank you enough for the kind words that you give us here that, and everybody really out there, I know you're the one that's here now,
10052000	10061000	that really are the fuel as to how we're able to punch in and do this across 722 weeks like we've been doing it.
10061000	10064000	I appreciate you guys so much. You don't even know.
10064000	10073000	I just wanted to call in just to tell you, you're not getting political. To me, it's not political because it's topics that do affect us.
10073000	10080000	And sometimes we got to put the controllers down, pick up the pens and paper, and we got to talk about this real quick.
10080000	10083000	Then we can go back to playing Street Fighter, you know?
10083000	10092000	I guess maybe a lot of it, Rama, comes down to the whole, you know, kind of that same line I just mentioned about in how you deliver the message.
10092000	10098000	Because I realize there's many people out there that voted for the, obviously, or who wouldn't be president,
10098000	10100000	there's many people that voted out there for him.
10100000	10107000	And I come in this really rough place because I have to accept that there's people that are going to have other perspectives.
10107000	10113000	And even though I sometimes really want to be angry about it because I think,
10113000	10121000	how could you vote for a vice president like that guy that is really against me as a person over something I can't control, right?
10122000	10125000	There's that part of me that gets really angry, but it's like,
10125000	10132000	but I'm not going to change minds by screaming at this person what a trash bag they are.
10132000	10134000	True, true.
10134000	10140000	So I have to try to, like, respect the position even when I don't understand it.
10140000	10144000	So I hope you all understand that's what I try to do with some of the politics on this show is that I realize,
10144000	10149000	you know, there's probably some real, there's probably some people, if they haven't tuned out already,
10149000	10152000	there's probably some people out there that fucking love guns that are out there.
10152000	10156000	And I don't get it, and it's one of those things I'm trying to respect it,
10156000	10161000	but at the same time now y'all are coming from my community, the video game community,
10161000	10167000	and no y'all, there's a real gun issue in this country.
10167000	10171000	And as I said earlier, everybody agrees, bump stocks, bad.
10171000	10175000	So let's at least start there. Like, why is this so difficult?
10175000	10178000	That's what I'm having a real hard time understanding right now.
10178000	10184000	Let me say this, I'm hell up on out here. I serve Marine Corps. I shot weapons.
10184000	10188000	I have actually gone out to the range and shot weapons for fun.
10188000	10194000	I like shooting an M16A2 service rifle, but you know, as a gamer and as a regular person,
10194000	10199000	you don't need a fucking rifle in your house.
10199000	10204000	I understand you want to protect, a 9mm is fine, your fists, whatever,
10204000	10210000	but you don't need a motherfucking air rifle in your house. You don't need it.
10210000	10215000	There is absolutely no reason for it.
10215000	10216000	Done.
10216000	10222000	I personally agree, but unfortunately you and I right now aren't the ones changing the laws,
10222000	10227000	but all we can do is yell and scream until the people we think that would accurately represent our positions
10227000	10229000	are the ones in office. That's all we can really do.
10229000	10231000	Alright Rama, I really gotta let you go.
10231000	10233000	We fight the good fight, okay.
10233000	10235000	Alright, take care my friend. Take care.
10235000	10237000	Alright, bye.
10237000	10240000	Alright, and with that I am going to close up the Skype line tonight.
10240000	10243000	Thank you so much for the calls. I really appreciate it.
10243000	10247000	That was a really heavy end to Orange Lounge Radio tonight, but it was good.
10247000	10250000	Loki, you weren't saying much, but hopefully you found it good.
10250000	10251000	Yeah, it was interesting.
10251000	10254000	Yeah, right? Anything you want to add or say?
10254000	10257000	No.
10257000	10262000	I don't know, I can't really think of many instances where video games have kind of saved my life.
10263000	10268000	Well, everybody brings different perspectives to it, but there's something that keeps you with them, right?
10268000	10272000	Why do you keep going back to video games?
10272000	10277000	Because it's fun. It's entertaining. I have other things I entertain myself with.
10277000	10282000	There's really nothing wrong with that answer either. There's really nothing wrong with that answer.
10282000	10289000	I think for Rama, sometimes video games were fun because the outside wasn't a lot of fun.
10289000	10297000	And maybe for Act Deaf, it was a similar thing where video games were the fun thing you do because there's not a lot of fun news in the community sometimes.
10297000	10311000	And for me, it was like I like to play video games because it was something I could talk to other kids about and not get teased for being overtly homosexual or whatever you want to call it.
10311000	10316000	There's lots of things that I find fun and entertaining. This is one of those things.
10316000	10322000	And I like Rocky, as I just talked about. We all got our other things. So, yeah, I get it. I get it.
10322000	10325000	And if we had a Qsar nearby, I'd be doing a podcast with our Qsar.
10325000	10326000	There you go. There you go.
10326000	10344000	We don't, so, ugh. I saw, like, we literally drove by the Fair Oaks laser tag place, which used to be Laser Force, which was our stiff, that was like, no, they were the enemy, laser force, yay, Qsar.
10344000	10345000	Now they're the only ones still in town.
10345000	10352000	Well, they're in town and same with Laser Quest, which is the one at Golf Land. I hate both. I haven't actually played Laser Force, so I can't knock it.
10352000	10358000	And they have Laser X near us too, but Qsar, man, that was the one that I played and I got hooked on.
10358000	10365000	And sadly, all those centers are the nearest ones in Vacaville, which is like a 45 minute drive away.
10365000	10369000	And it's not maintained well either.
10370000	10377000	All right. Well, anyhow, we are going to end Orange John's Radio on that note tonight. Thank you guys so much for the calls and I really appreciate it.
10377000	10383000	You know, yeah, we went, we went a little deep tonight, but sometimes that's just the way life's going to go.
10383000	10388000	You know, that's how we, that's how we get through some of these difficult weeks together, sharing stories.
10388000	10391000	So thank you guys as always for listening to the show.
10391000	10394000	As I do always say, if you enjoyed the show, help us spread the word.
10394000	10397000	A nice five star review on iTunes goes a really, really long way.
10397000	10403000	As does word of mouth. Tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
10403000	10406000	As long as the voices are here to put out there.
10406000	10410000	And who knows, maybe after our discussion tonight, there's going to be some more people that want to speak up.
10410000	10414000	So I encourage you to. Let's have a civil discussion.
10414000	10417000	Participate at orangejohnsradio.com.
10418000	10421000	We read, we read the tweets, even if we don't always respond to everyone on air.
10421000	10426000	But at OLR on Twitter, as well as Facebook, facebook.com slash orangejohnsradio.
10426000	10428000	But that is it. We're going to be back in seven days.
10428000	10431000	Jamie will be back. She missed a heck of an episode tonight.
10431000	10433000	I'm sure she would have had a lot to say.
10433000	10435000	So we'll just have to check in with her next week.
10435000	10438000	But I hope you're feeling better if you're out there, Jamie.
10438000	10443000	And we'll see her in seven days. We'll see you guys in seven days before we roll the credits.
10443000	10445000	Let's get everybody's final thought.
10445000	10447000	Loki, I'll start with you. Your final thought tonight.
10447000	10450000	My final thought is, I guess off the plate.
10450000	10455000	Well, I am going to play some more video games this week because Burnout Paradise Remastered is coming out.
10455000	10458000	I am going to buy that. I definitely want to get back into that.
10458000	10461000	I do need that. I do need the work on my game.
10461000	10463000	It's kind of like, I don't know.
10463000	10468000	I got to restart if I was going to do It's Time the Car, which I don't even know if I'm going to do that anymore.
10468000	10471000	I'd have to restart it completely anyways.
10471000	10474000	And so it's just kind of finding a project that I really want to work on.
10474000	10481000	The project I really want to work on is so fucking huge in scope that I can't work on it.
10481000	10486000	So that's the only bummer with that, but I have to find something new.
10486000	10491000	I know you're so against this idea, but even I have to echo Bobby Blackwolf and say,
10491000	10493000	Just do something. I know.
10493000	10497000	Start with a Pong clone. Start with, just do something.
10497000	10502000	Start with a clone. Do something. Finish a product. Feel good about it. Then tackle the bigger stuff.
10502000	10506000	But that's the problem. I don't feel good about something like that.
10506000	10508000	How would you know when you don't finish anything?
10508000	10512000	I know because, fine. I will do something.
10512000	10515000	Yeah, thank you. Act F says, Pong with cars. There you go.
10515000	10524000	Pong with cars, no. Okay, but I have ideas. It's just the problem is they're too grandiose.
10524000	10531000	Do what the Titan team did at Blizzard and dial it back to its strongest concept, which was Overwatch.
10532000	10534000	Yeah, well.
10534000	10537000	Alright, I'm trying. I'm trying. Alright. That's a long final thought.
10537000	10544000	My final thought is, I had the Marshmallow Peeps Oreos this week, and they're actually really good.
10544000	10549000	I don't care how y'all feel about Peeps. There's no Marshmallow in the cookie, so if you're like,
10549000	10552000	Ehh, Marshmallow. It's not in the cookie. It just tastes like Peeps.
10552000	10555000	And I liked them. Sorry if you didn't.
10555000	10558000	Have a good night, everybody. We'll see you in seven days. Bye.
